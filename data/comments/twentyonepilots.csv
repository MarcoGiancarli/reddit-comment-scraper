twentyonepilots,3dyar4,redhedped,15,Mon Jul 20 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"ok but like.... can we just talk about the symbolism in this video. at first i wasn't that impressed with the video, until i thought about it further. we see tyler dancing with Fame and Success before they are solidified concepts. him just scribbling on their hazmat suits shows that they were abstract concepts to him at first. then, when he gets up on stage in front of everyone and sees the huge crowd, the two initially abstract concepts are solidified to him, as seen by the clear labels on their suits. in front of a crowd, he has to confront the reality of these originally abstract concepts -- he has to literally ""kneel"" to them. he can't turn away. the pressure and responsibility that comes with that carry some weight in relation to the music industry and TOP's place in it, making the video much heavier for me."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,AirBear7,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"i saw some people say that maybe he wrote the logo and then his signature on the suits, that sounds entirely valid as well. this is just how i personally interpreted it."

twentyonepilots,3dyar4,mcninsanity,11,Mon Jul 20 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's centered around the idea that the music industry likes to keep walls up to control and contain itself, and is threatened by an person or persons that have the audacity to try and tear down walls, and especially threatened by anyone that has success forging their own trail."

twentyonepilots,3dyar4,MrDadShirts,6,Mon Jul 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but I don't think the song needed a video.

twentyonepilots,3dyar4,LePenetrator,6,Mon Jul 20 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"I think the video was very weak imo. I was kind of hoping for more Josh in the video with the drums being such an insane part of the song. Also, the video was a lot of Tyler just rapping into the camera and that is a pet peeve of mine for videos."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,three-bars,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:52 2015 UTC,Hmm maybe that's the whole point. The song does critique the music industry at one point soooo
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,LePenetrator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"Ya, I understand the deeper meaning they show in the video and how the song criticizes the industry, but the video just seemed awkward to me.

twentyonepilots,3dyar4,HooolySmokes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a filmmaker by profession and passion, so take my opinion for what it's worth or not.  I'm in love with the concept, but like most of their videos done by Mark (who I am pretty sure got the nod on this), it falls just short. My old roommate Isaac was extremely close to getting the job for the Car Radio video, and his treatment for it is still the coolest music video idea I've ever heard of, but the video that ended up being made is still good but not great imo.  Same with this one. Love the idea, but the execution falls flat, mainly in the color treatment and the live footage. More of it was out of focus than in, and it wasn't made at all to fit the mood of the first half."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,james_wightman,4,Mon Jul 20 23:42:28 2015 UTC,I'm curious... do you mind sharing your friend's idea for the Car Radio music video? :)
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,tompynuts,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, although I don't remember all of the details greatly.  It's basically two separate sets/scenes that alternate towards each other. The first is Tyler driving down the interstate at night, looking fairly drowsy as he raps the song. Lots of close ups, and something feels just a bit off, and it gets more dramatic and bizarre as it keeps switching throughout the song.  The second scene is him walking through a sort of oasis, or some kind of warm, bright, serene environment. Like I said, it goes back and forth between the two.   Right before the bridge, in the warm scene, Tyler looks down and finds out that he's all bloody on his torso. Then, throughout the entire bridge, it cuts to the car scene, with him more drowsy than ever, and you see a wider shot showing that he's been stabbed in the stomach (the implication that he literally fought and killed the man who stole his car radio), and after you see this, Tyler passes out and the car drifts and eventually flips (think of the Fight Club scene like this). This fades to black after the last, ""And now I just sittttttttttttt.""  It fades back up into the nice scene, which it turns out is a dream state Tyler is going to in and out of consciousness while he's driving. I think at the end there's a scene of paramedics trying to resuscitate him.   Not sure if I'm remembering the entire thing completely correctly, but that's the gist."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,james_wightman,4,Tue Jul 21 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"idk man, that kinda takes the song the wrong way. its not meant so literally."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,HooolySmokes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:34 2015 UTC,"Well, his car radio was literally stolen, but the literal event is used as a representative metaphor, because it was first a literal example, for the fear of being alone with your thoughts.   It's not like the actual video in any way represents that literally or metaphorically, and that's fine. Music videos don't have to do that, but a lot of the 'message' of the treatment they almost went with would have been conveyed visually in a way that I can't really explain well by typing out."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,james_wightman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"The idea is brilliant. I could picture it in my head.  However, I don't think I could handle seeing that. I don't think I could handle seeing Tyler bloodied and edging close to death (even if it's just a video). Tyler twitching in the Car Radio video right before he shaved his head gave me enough chills. Like, I could feel the anxiety seep through. There's something simple but personal in that video that connects Tyler to the viewer. But that's just me though.  But really brilliant and creative idea by your friend. Art makes people think and I'm sure if that video was made, it will spark some pretty deep conversations."
twentyonepilots,3dyar4,tylerandjosh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"We honestly both loved and still love the idea so much that we were close to making it on our own just as a passion project. We talked about it a lot, but then I ended up moving cross country."

In his speech, he said something along the lines of ""Look around you; these are your people"", and I just had chills run through my entire body. And then Tyler and Josh came out in their ski masks with Guns For Hands as the opener. It was a really surreal experience to see them on stage in person after how much their music had meant to me throughout everything that year.  Being at Bunbury in June for the Lane Boy music video was also pretty awesome."
twentyonepilots,3e1h0d,JoeD186,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Seeing them cover Summertime Sadness was beautiful, as well as a snippet of No Woman, No Cry before transitioning into Ride, the latter being at Bonnaroo this past summer.  Just seeing spontaneous things that you don't expect make the shows that much better."

twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,YovahnHoole,4,Mon Jul 20 11:40:56 2015 UTC,You're right. I like hometown and was a little bummed they didn't play it last night but that's just me wishing they performed every song from blurryface.
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,hellofellowstrangers,3,Mon Jul 20 11:50:46 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea, but they haven't been playing Hometown or Trees at festivals."
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,HoldenAllen,4,Mon Jul 20 14:16:07 2015 UTC,They've been playing (at least) the ending part of trees as a finale at festivals.
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,xman2987,2,Mon Jul 20 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"Not so sure about that last part. They frequently play Trees at festivals, often close them with it, actually."
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,TyCooper8,0,Mon Jul 20 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  but they just do the drum thing...at Bonnaroo they for sure didn't do any thing but the drumming"
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,HoldenAllen,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"That still counts, it's listed as ""'Trees' (drumset)"" on their setlist. In my opinion it's even better, but I do see what you mean."
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,TyCooper8,3,Mon Jul 20 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hometown is going to be the new finale song, taking the place of Trees. They would loop the part from 3:25-3:38 in Trees while they set up the crowd-held drums, then finish off the song.   I believe they're going to do this with the loop from 2:48-3:01 in Hometown, and finish strong with the big dancey part."
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,DeadNerd,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"In the Spotify commentary for The Run and Go, he says that its a song he imagines paying during the day at festivals (because they aren't big enough for nighttime slots, not yet). I'll be seeing them at Osheaga in two weeks so I'll let ya'll know if they play Hometown"

twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,thepathofwisdom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"I would have thought that The Judge and We Don't Believe What's On TV would be the festival songs. Catchy, dancey, easy to sing along with.  Not that I don't love Hometown, but it feels more like a club song."
twentyonepilots,3dxoa2,candlesandfish,0,Mon Jul 20 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"I don't really get a festival vibe from Hometown. Festivals are about playing exciting fast and upbeat things, and they have many songs off Vessel and Blurryface that just do that better than Hometown. Not that it's not a great song, I jus do not feel this would excite people at a festival"
twentyonepilots,3dxewp,TheLuckyShamrock,5,Mon Jul 20 09:29:19 2015 UTC,"No update for 5 EST, I like to imagine that Tyler or whoever runs the blurryface account just fell asleep"

twentyonepilots,3dxewp,candlesandfish,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:11 2015 UTC,I don't think so. The account is also doing an hourly countdown with its following list. Blurryface unfollows someone every hour as well.

twentyonepilots,3dw1wy,horaciomatador,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:01:50 2015 UTC,Really?? Is that how short their concerts normally are? I've only ever seen them at music festivals.
twentyonepilots,3dw1wy,seganr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's a normal concert length for them. This was in Auckland two weeks ago. It was still the best concert I've ever been to, I just wish it was longer."
twentyonepilots,3dw1wy,mtbkr24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:10 2015 UTC,The concert I went to lasted for an hour. But it was the 3rd concert since Tyler lost his voice so I guess they had to cut the setlist short because he's still recovering. But really great show overall.

twentyonepilots,3dt90a,Nadaar,7,Sun Jul 19 06:04:01 2015 UTC,"They will be in the Philippines on ""Monday"" and the Philippines are 12 hours ahead of EST which means the video could be released Sunday night at 11 pm EST"

'Stay Alive': from the song Truce and an unofficial motto of the band, some are making an effort to make 'The Few, The Proud, The Emotional' another/the new motto.   Spooky Jim: Josh. Probably a reference to his love of the X-Files but I can't confirm.   Blurryface: The name given to Tyler's insecurities, is displayed by the black wax on his neck and hands during performances and is portrayed in music videos with red contacts and a deeper voice than Tyler's. Also he has his own twitter.  Zack: Tyler's brother. Both boys are very close with their family but Zack Joseph in particular has been mention in a few songs and contributed to earlier albums."

twentyonepilots,3djrsi,imperatuss,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"This is my comment on their YouTube video, which is how I feel about Goner. Of course, you may want to check the video to see the background and know what I'm talking about, click here to see that.  I know this strays away from the whole Blurryface persona, but bear with me here.  At first glance, the background looks like birds. This is just the obvious thing that our mind goes to, as it does indeed resemble the shadow a bird would cast.  However, I looked a little closer, and realized how easily it can be interpreted as people, falling.  I think that's what this song is about. You've fallen over the edge, and you need someone to pull you back up, to catch your fall. That person, is the ""you"" referred to in this song, be it whoever you wish in your life, is who you need to save you, before you're gone.  At least, that's how I see it.﻿"

Just my opinion but I think it was an interesting concept, just not done well.

twentyonepilots,3djrsi,MrMidnight,3,Fri Jul 17 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"It's much better imo if you view it as a finale, rather than an individual song. I struggle to listen to Truce (which is in a similar vein) and Goner on their own (e.g. If I have iTunes on shuffle) because it doesn't feel right on it's own.  I agree with you on some points, but in terms of it in relation to the album, it's a great song. But I agree with you that on its own, it sounds a bit odd and out of place (I personally think the whole ordering of Blurryface is messed up, but that's another topic)."

Which in some cases thats true but others all it does is make you reflect on your doubts and whats bothring you. But that verse is good for a point about friends so thanks!
twentyonepilots,3dgkvx,CertifiedRogue,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:33 2015 UTC,I think maybe you should talk about how sitting in silence and praying gives you time to think of all the sins you've committed in your life (or that day) and then talk about how God imps going to forgive you of those no matter what.
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,candlesandfish,22,Wed Jul 15 12:20:23 2015 UTC,"The two contrasting verses of Fairly Local seem very reminiscent of certain portions of Romans 7:   14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.   Compare this with Fairly Local:   I’m evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will, They say I’m emotional, What I wanna save I’ll kill, Is that who I truly am? I truly don’t have a chance, Tomorrow I’ll keep a beat, And repeat yesterday’s dance   Another section of Romans 7:   22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.   These verses describe the Christian's inner struggle to do what is right and fight what is evil. The second verse contrasts with the first in that Tyler recognizes his ability to fight against the evil inside of him:   I’m not evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will fight, I know I’m emotional, What I wanna save I will try, I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance, Tomorrow I’ll switch the beat, To avoid yesterday’s dance"

twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motecizuma,12,Wed Jul 15 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"Ode to Sleep has a reference to Peter denying Jesus three times before the cock crows:   I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times, Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,   From John 18:   15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. 16 But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in. 17 Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You are not also one of this Man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” 18 Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself. 19 The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine. 20 Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet,[b] and in secret I have said nothing. 21 Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Indeed they know what I said.”22 And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, “Do You answer the high priest like that?”23 Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?” 24 Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. 25 Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, “You are not also one of His disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not!” 26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?” 27 Peter then denied again; and immediately a cock crowed."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,5,Wed Jul 15 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"Another thing from Ode to Sleep. When he says ""Metaphorically I'm a whore"" to describe his 3x denial of God, it seems that he's referencing the many times God says in the Old Testament that Israel was whoring after other false gods.   Deuteronomy 3:16:   And the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them.""   Exodus 34:10-16   And he said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the Lord, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you. Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Take care, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you go, lest it become a snare in your midst. You shall tear down their altars and break their pillars and cut down their Asherim (for you shall worship no other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God), lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice, and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.""   Judges 2:17   Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and they did not do so.    There are a lot more verses of the same type."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,open-aperture96,3,Wed Jul 15 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"Good reference. Also important to note that Peter did this after swearing he wouldn't when Jesus told him that he'd do it, earlier in the night. And sworn repeatedly, ""I'd die instead"", sort of stuff. And yet...  Also important that he does the opposite and promises to look after God's people three times in his restoration, after Christ's Resurrection."

Also Jesus is often referred to as the Living Water which connects to Tyler screaming to his Father to wash and cleanse him. And the line ""you specialize in dying"" seems to be a reference to the time when Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,open-aperture96,7,Wed Jul 15 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"I visited Israel for two weeks in January, and my tour guide, Dan, was a Messianic (Christian) Jew. We were exploring sites and old ruins, and there were a lot of these things called mikvehs, which were little pools of water with steps leading into them. Dan told us that the mikvehs were used for the ritual cleansing sometimes described in Scripture. The special thing about mikvehs is that the water in them is running water, not stagnant, which he said is translated as living water in Scripture. Jesus describes himself as the water that cleansed the people of God from spiritual filth for hundreds of generations. The rich history of God's people brings even more meaning to our understanding of his Word and I think it's incredible :)"
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,5,Wed Jul 15 16:27:18 2015 UTC,Dude that's really cool.
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"Good observations. Adding verse references :)  The Parable of the Prodigal Son (a story with a meaning that Jesus told): Luke 15:11-32  On Jesus and Living Water, the most explicit reference is here in John 7 verses 37-38 - it helps to know that the festival they were celebrating was about water:   On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.""   There's also this, a few chapters earlier in John 4, where Jesus asks a woman at the well (who had been married and divorced many times and was living with someone she wasn't married to, seriously not the kind of person you expect holy people to spend time with) for a drink of water:   Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”  The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”  Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”   I definitely agree with the ""you specialise in dying"" line - of course He does, He's done it...and the important thing about it is that not only did it bring salvation, but he conquered death in the process."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,8,Wed Jul 15 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"I'll start (I've put links to the full chapters on the relevant text, for context):  Hometown: two old testament ones (at least, if someone finds more I'd love to hear them!)  I know, I know You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones I know, I know You make the fire in my bones, and make it grow   From Jeremiah 20: the relevant bit is this:    ""Then I said, “I will not make mention of Him, Nor speak anymore in His name.” But His word was in my heart like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, And I could not.""   I think that one's pretty self explanatory, but I'll explain more if anyone wants.  Also,  Put away, put away All the gods your father served today Put away, put away Your traditions, believe me when I say We don't know, we don't know How to put back the power in our soul We don't know, we don't know Where to find what once was in our bones   This is from Joshua 24, and it references this passage:   Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve the Lord! And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.   Joshua is a history book, and at this point the Israelites were in the desert, about to go into the Promised Land. But they had a choice - either they chose the gods of their fathers and those around them, or the God of the Bible, and Christianity. Joshua, their leader, is telling them that this is the point where they make the choice."

twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,bulletwords,7,Wed Jul 15 15:48:12 2015 UTC,"Taxi Cab is obviously teeming with references to Tyler's faith, but I think it also names some major Scriptural truths and themes.  In the very beginning of the song, it's pretty obvious that he is speaking of the Holy Spirit, and how the Spirit heals the broken minds of men to make them more like Christ. He also references that dual-mindedness that /u/micahjahns and /u/candlesandfish have mentioned.    I wanna fall inside your ghost  And fill up every hole inside my mind  And I want everyone to know  That I am half a soul divided   Later, he says that one man is driving the taxi cab. The driver contrives a new route to save the passenger from his death, and then suddenly there are three men up front in the cab, and Tyler describes himself emerging from what seems to be a coffin, the lock of which has been picked. It seems like this is Tyler describing the moment of his salvation, where initially God had a plan to save him, and then he received Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, hence the other two men who join the first. Tyler himself is showing that he had no hand in his salvation; it was all by the power of Christ over death. Ephesians 2:1-10 is a clear explanation of this:   And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.   I think it's a beautiful when one of the drivers says, ""We're driving toward the morning sun, where all your blood is washed away and all you did will be undone."" We've been ransomed by Christ's blood and now we're dead to sin, and through Christ we can fight sin in ourselves."

twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,open-aperture96,7,Wed Jul 15 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"We gotta talk about Goner!   I've noticed throughout all the songs in general, Tyler mentions suicide, and it seems to be a theme that he wants people to understand. In the music video for Car Radio, he is sitting in the corner by a kitchen sink while he's contemplating existence and death, and in Kitchen Sink, he says that kitchen sinks have a special meaning to him that he hasn't told anyone. In an interview he said an extremely important event happened to him at a kitchen sink, or his darkest hour, something like that. In the original version of Goner, the accordion is making a creaking noise, but if you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that it sounds exactly like the noise of a creaking noose. I really get the feeling that at one point he may have considered/tried to kill himself, and that maybe it happened at a kitchen sink.   So to me, Goner seems like one man's prayer, a plea to God to save his life. He wants to be known by God. Though he is weak and beaten down, the ""ghost of You"", the Holy Spirit is close to him. So he is safe.   It's an incredibly powerful song. I have to skip it unless I'm alone cause it makes me cry. Blurryface came out around the time I heard the testimony of an acquaintance of mine, in which she said that recently she tried to kill herself and did not succeed. She talked about how God is fighting the battle for her. I'm tearing up now writing this, whoops. I really associate Goner with the emotions I felt when listening to her."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,v_ronatron,6,Wed Jul 15 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think ""I wanna be known by You"" sums up the plea of the song quite well."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,4,Wed Jul 15 18:05:19 2015 UTC,"I like Goner. It's tragic and emotional and beautiful, but I don't see it as hopeless, in either version. In the first, the plea, as /u/bulletwords said, is 'to be know by You'. The second version that's still true, and it's also God as refuge 'though I'm weak and beaten down / I'll slip away into the sound / the ghost of you is close to me / I'm inside out / You're underneath'   I wouldn't read too much into the kitchen sink / creaking noose thing. I think 'ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again' from Glowing Eyes is probably a bit more relevant there, but then the music interpretation is what you get from it :) The line from Glowing Eyes, especially in such a cheerful song, makes me shudder in a way that Goner doesn't.   I probably see Goner a bit differently to some although I'm guessing a fair amount of the clique can relate the same way I do, having been in the situation of desperation and at the end of myself before. I worked through the issues of suicide and wanting it all to end and not having the strength to get through it, and by God's grace I'm still here, and that's all in the past. I've also walked several friends through that path, and my sister's been in and out of psych wards for getting that far. It's something that's more common than we realise, and many people find themselves in the place of this song - I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath, don't let me be gone - at the end of themselves, but still wanting someone to save them. And that's an important thing to acknowledge as well, because there were times that happened to me and something did intervene."
twentyonepilots,3ddgwp,motrixMythoclast,6,Wed Jul 15 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"One of the things that comes up all through the music is the idea of being doublesided. There's the blurryface/Tyler dualism in the latest record, but there's also references to 'two halves' etc. everywhere. I'm going to make a list but I'll probably forget some, let me know if I do!  ""Doubleminded"" as an adjective is in James, twice, first in chapter 1vs 2-8:   ""Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away""   Then later on in chapter 4 verses 7-10:     Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.    There's also being two things at once as /u/micahjahns referenced in Romans 7:15, where ""I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.""  There's also just the obvious interpretation of him being torn between two things, too, without having to reference Scripture, but that's always what I think of. Lyric references:  Anathema-  I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I     Don't know where I should go and the tears and the fears begin to multiply Taking time in a simple place in my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase And it's said that a war's lead but I forget That I let another day go by I want to be afraid but it seems that these days I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father, Am I screaming to an empty sky? Empty sky, no way, that's me cause one half of my heart is free Empty sky, no way, that's me cause the other half of my heart's asleep   Semi-Automatic-  I'm never what I like I'm double-sided And I just can't hide I kinda like it When I make you cry Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside  (later)  My prayer is schizophrenic   Taxi Cab-  I wanna fall inside your ghost And fill up every hole inside my mind And I want everyone to know That I am half a soul divided   Fairly Local is all about having two natures or two sides, as is much of blurryface.  Polarize is (in my opinion) a fight against the double-sidedness. Wanting to 'will one thing', to quote Kierkegaard talking about the same phenomenon.  This is in no way exhaustive. Feel free to add verses or lyrics!"

twentyonepilots,3d909a,ConvolutedBoy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Last years show was much better - this venue has poles in the way, the whole floor is flat so my mrs couldn't see the whole night and a smaller stage than last year. Obviously the music was great but it was more of a dingy pub venue with poor lighting compared to the great show last year at 170 Russell.  They played no woman no cry which was unexpected and cool. I was getting into it, but I get the feeling a lot of people there didn't know the song at all. I assume this is because a few of the 'regge-ish' songs might have been influenced by this track."
twentyonepilots,3d909a,may0man,5,Thu Jul 16 22:44:56 2015 UTC,I can't imagine why they wouldn't eventually play all of Blurryface especially since this entire album was conceived with live shows in mind.

twentyonepilots,3cxpzi,memeshay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:44 2015 UTC,I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one. 99% of pop country has a very specific sound with a deep and southern voice. The majority of the songs have very similar chords and or lyrics

twentyonepilots,3cxn4p,PeteWentzEyebrows,4,Sat Jul 11 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"When Twenty One Pilots signed to Fueled By Ramen, Tyler and Josh signed over the rights to Regional At Best. The intention of Tyler, Josh, and FBR was to remake songs from Regional At Best for a new major label debut. The legal process was made easier by handing over the entire album rather than specific songs. To make this more palatable on a personal level, Tyler secured the copyright for the self-titled album under his name. I would hypothesize that this also allows the former members of TOP to continue to receive royalties from sales/plays online.  Regional At Best's versions of songs that went onto Vessel are pretty different in several ways. The easiest way to prevent confusion was to market reworked and fresh versions of the songs. This also allowed Tyler and Josh to re-record the songs to better match what they do with them in their live shows.  Regional At Best is still floating around online. You can dig it up if you really want it. I got my hands on the files and burned a CD. It's a great surprise for my fellow fans when they find it in my car. :)"

If they released it as its own entity, people might feel ripped off. It's an album they used to show their style and market to record companies.   Just stories I've heard. Not sure."

It has a small-sized keyboard with 32 minikeys and a pitch-bend wheel, vibrato and sustain buttons, an internal Frequency modulation (usually referred to as FM) synthesizer offering 25 different voices with 6-note polyphony, two operators, and a very basic chord sequencer. It also has a loudspeaker.  It supports MIDI, having a MIDI Out connector which allows the keyboard to control external MIDI equipment. It does not have a MIDI In connector. Although originally made for the consumer market, this keytar's MIDI out features are very powerful. Its drum rhythms and accompaniment are transmitted on separate MIDI channels, so that an external drum machine, sampler, or other MIDI equipment can be programmed to play the backing parts. Drums are transmitted on channel 16; Bass on 15; and three chord harmonies on channels 12-14. MIDI start/stop and tempo sync are also transmitted so an external sequencer may be utilized as well.

Not just that but the lyrics were so incredibly amazing and unique and real that there was no possible way I could think, ""But this is just a song about a car radio."" which is what my sister thought when she heard it. It was clear that Tyler had put his heart and soul into the song and so the lyrics made sense to me. Then I listened to their cover of Can't Help Falling In Love and I couldn't help falling in love. The ukulele was the best thing ever."

twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,dizap001,4,Fri Jul 10 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"First song I heard was Ode to Sleep when a friend put on Vessel in the car while we were driving back home from college for spring break. He's like ""I think you'll really like this band based on the kind of alternative stuff you listen to. Vessel is one of the tightest, most well composed album I've ever heard"". I end up downloading the entire album immediately after Semi Automatic. I so totally loved the quirky sound and introspective lyrics and the infectious spoken word/screaming. This was 4 months ago and I have since heard every song by them now. They are easily my favorite band."
twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,open-aperture96,4,Fri Jul 10 04:02:17 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who plays industrial music in high school, back in 2011, and he had a show at the Mad Hatter in Covington Ky. I bought a ticket, but I was not able to drive at the time, so I had to stay home without a ride while one of my friends went.   The show was on July 20, 2011, and my friend's band was opening for two little bands called Challenger and Twenty One Pilots. This was just after the first section of their Ode to Sleep video was filmed, less than two weeks after Regional at Best dropped. I was bummed I missed the show, especially after my friend that got to go came back raving about this band that put on the best show he'd ever seen and showed me the shirt he'd gotten signed. He sent me a few of their songs, and I was hooked. Ode to Sleep, Holding On to You, Guns for Hands, Kitchen Sink, Ruby, I loved them all. Tyler talked about some things I felt, some of which developed into full blown depression that both I and my girlfriend deal with, and both found TOP to be extremely helpful independently of each other. The music, too, was so different from anything that was ""me."" I was the picture of the middle school mainstream metalhead who had discovered emo just a little too late, and I had a vendetta against anything not heavy. But something about the melodies and the emotion got me, and I couldn't stop. It changed me (for the better in the long term).  I started taking my laptop to school and playing the album on repeat while I did my work,  but I never folowed up further than getting House of Gold as well when they released it, and Jar of Hearts, which is on of my favorites. Then one day about a year later, a classmate that I had basically nothing in common with saw the TOP sticker on my laptop that had been given to me out of pity and told me that she loved them, and I decided to give them a look again and see what was new.   I found Vessel and have been following along since, I preordered the ultimate vinyl for myself and the ultimate cd for my girlfriend as soon as they were available after Blurryface was announced. She and I love matching our shirts when we go out, which isn't often due to distance. This is my ""hipster cred,"" though I introduce everyone I can to the band.   I kept the ticket, too. For some reason that was the one I didn't trash or lose out of all the show tickets I had."
twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,infinitetheory,3,Fri Jul 10 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"The first song I heard was House of Gold on the radio. I just liked the name of the song, and the name of the band. So I remembered it, and looked them up when I got home. Loved House of Gold, wasn't really into their other stuff. But something kept bringing me back to them. Maybe they're an acquired taste because now they're my favorite by far and I love every song with everything in me."

For some reason I didn't think to look more into them until about a month later, when I listened to Vessel all the way through. From that point forward they've been far and away my favorite band (2 years 2 months now). But I got full-on obsessed when I saw them live for the first time (2 years 1 month ago). If I had to pick one song that ""hooked"" me, it'd be Trees, because of how frickin amazing it is live."
twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,DJLusciousEagle,2,Fri Jul 10 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"I remember the first time I heard Twenty One Pilots, during the beginning of 2013 I was going through the radio because I was sick of my usual poppy stations and then I heard Holding Onto You. I wasn't instantly hooked mainly because I thought it was a bit poppy and was already popular, but I was definitely intrigued. After listening to it again along with House of Gold and Car Radio, I really liked it but was still sceptical. But then I watched and heard Guns for Hands and that's when I was really hooked and knew that this band was something amazing and different."

twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,Itsveryhardtopick,2,Fri Jul 10 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"The first song I heard was holding on to you. It was during a time I had just got in some trouble so I had no phone or any other way to listen to music except through the radio every time a good song came on I would write down the artist/song title. I was listening to the alternative music station when it came on it was just so catchy, and just a really fun song to listen sometime late I was on YouTube where I let it do the playlist thing based off of holding on to you. I was studying for some test when a song came on I literally stopped what I was doing and let the music entrance me, it was car radio and from that moment I loved tøp"
twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,Rayning14,2,Fri Jul 10 05:23:03 2015 UTC,The first song I heard was House of Gold and I liked it because of it's indie/folk-y vibe. Then I saw some people I know posting about a concert they went to so I checked out more of their stuff and listened to Vessel in it's entirety and got hooked.
twentyonepilots,3cr8qv,grumbledum,2,Fri Jul 10 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"The first twenty one pilots song I heard was Guns for Hands. They were the first support band for Paramore, I had no idea who they were and honestly, I wasn't paying much attention. I was hooked when they played Car Radio. I adored the simplicity and how the song slowly moved towards a climax. I just shut my eyes while Tyler was rapping and the song really hit me as I was going through a hard time, and I felt emotional as the techno part set in because I felt like it was a release of all this emotion.   I got my hands on Vessel as soon as I could and I've loved them ever since."

So then I saw some more music videos and really liked ride, and tear in my heart. Then I listened to the whole Blurryface and I loved it.

It almost feels like a rebellion against God in a way (Ecclesiastes 1:9). It really interests me, you can look at it a ton of different ways.  I also really like ""I begin to understand why God died."" To me, it's his realization as to why society and individual people reject God. He understands what bones they have to pick with this higher power, and he pretty much agrees with them.  Anything from Ruby. I feel like not many people every really talk about Ruby. It's odd!"
twentyonepilots,3cqbi8,Condor36,3,Thu Jul 9 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to see you interpret that line from ""A Car, A Torch, A Death"" that way. I'm not sure about you but I'm a Christian and I've always interpreted it as him seeing the brokenness of the world, all the evil pain and sadness caused by sin and understanding why it was Jesus died for us. So that we would be saved from eternal punishment of our sins and instead be able to live eternally with him.  This isn't to say your interpretation is wrong at all, I'm just very intrigued by how different worldviews can bring different understandings. It's honestly one of my favorite parts about discussing this band with people."
twentyonepilots,3cqbi8,open-aperture96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:26:47 2015 UTC,Along those lines I kinda saw it as a parallel of how this person he's singing about (a loved one perhaps) has given him their heart perhaps in an attempt to save him. It's a parallel because God gave us his heart and sacrificed his son in an attempt to do the same.
twentyonepilots,3cqbi8,bW0LO99,2,Fri Jul 10 04:11:14 2015 UTC,"I love those lyrics so much and I agree with you completely, especially about Ruby.

In addition to their usual treatment of depression and anxiety, it is one of the few (if any?) songs I know that critiques our tendency to immerse ourselves in a stream of stimulation rather than confront reality [1].  Not just mortality, but also personal agency over our lives [2].  There's a lot more for me in this song, thanks for the question!   [1]""Too deep. Please stop thinking.

twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,b0x0fawes0me,16,Thu Jul 9 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"Warning: wall of text, especially because of lyric discussion. - ETA, thanks for the gold, anonymous friend! |-/  I think Tyler would be happy you're thinking, rather than disrespected, so yes you're right that I don't think he'd mind. And if that's what you take from it, it's not a bad takeaway. They're Christians, not Christian music, exactly. And I don't think they'd appreciate it if the industry tried to put them in the Christian music box, since they sing about a lot of things, but their faith is always going to be there.  My take on it all is the he's struggling with his doubts and being real about them. Christians don't believe blindly, and we don't always feel that we know that God is there. And especially in the dark times when we doubt ourselves and everything, we wonder if we're 'singing to an empty sky', as Tyler sings in Anathema. But Anathema, I think, shows that conflict with our doubts and the resolution:  I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I Don't know where I should go And the tears and the fears begin to multiply Taking time in a simple place In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase And it's said that a war's lead but I forget That I let another day go by I want to be afraid but it seems that these days I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father Am I screaming to an empty sky? Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.       The thing about being doublesided, or internal conflict where half believes and half doubts, is very real and it's a common thing that Tyler brings up in his music later on as well, although if you don't know about the reference (it's a more obscure one from James) you won't necessarily see it as Christian, especially because it refers to something most humans can identify with.   So, ""I'm calling my father (God) / am I screaming to an empty sky?"" is the expression of that doubt, but the next lines are the answer to the doubt.   Be Concerned, you're absolutely right, is about ""I don't believe, and I suck at this"". I think it's an awesome song, because there's a pressure in Christianity to look like you're always believing in God, to never doubt, to always be devoted. But the thing is, people wax and wane with their devotion, and their doubts, and one of the things I've found most helpful in Christianity is the realisation of how imperfect I am. So ""Be Concerned"" speaks from that place where you say ""I make all these promises, and my culture around me expects me to do this stuff, but I'm not doing it right now, I doubt you, I suck at this, and I'm going to be honest with you""   So to address Be Concerned more directly:   Where'd you go, huh? They all think I know you, It's so hard to motivate, Me to devote a, Single inch of me to, Something I can't see I, Don't mean to pry but why, Would you even make the eyes?   Expressing doubts, and his confession that it's hard to believe in what you can't see. If God is real and we can't see him with eyes, what's the point of having eyes?  I don't believe my ears, And I'm scared of my own head, I will deny you for years, Then I'll make you raise me from the dead, And if I said that I would live for you, For nothing in return, Well I'm sorry Mr. Gullible, But lying's all I've learned, So be concerned.       ""My head's messed up, I can't believe my thoughts or what I think I know or what I hear, and I say and sing that I'll follow you for nothing in return, but right now that's not reality, that's not where I'm at right now, and you should know that"" The ""I'll deny you for years and make you raise me from the dead"" line is talking about how hypocritical it seems to live a life doubting God, or pretending He doesn't exist, because sometimes it's easier, and then coming back and asking (yet again) for His help to get out of the self destructive state we're in. The good thing is that Christianity believes God is forever willing to do that, but Tyler's working through how unreasonable that is for us to do. What kind of person does that in a relationship?  I try to say goodbye, defy, and deny, What it is I'm fearing, Clearly I am dying, dearly I am writing, Merely testifying, that the test to fly requires I, Pass the test with colors flying,   He's working through his feelings, wanting to deny what he's feeling either way because he's being torn between believing God exists and refusing to believe/not being able to believe, and he's struggling with his perfectionist nature making him want to be single (not double)minded  I don't believe you most the time, I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,   The struggle, and telling everyone he is fine, which is what's expected of him  You are the pearl, I am the swine, So break my life and take this rhyme,   ""Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine"" - Matthew 7:6, Tyler's realising that God is treasure and condemning himself for his doubts and his faithlessness, and asking to be broken of his condition and offers the rhyme as all he can give  I'm so sorry but I do believe, That all my bridges, I have burned, And I've earned a policy of no return, So be concerned.   In the end he knows God exists, but feel unworthy of a relationship with Him, since he's reneged on his obligations so many time and been such a horrible person to God generally. The good thing about Christianity is that we believe God is concerned and the offering of the song is accepted, and God will take him back despite his doubts.   I'm curious as to how you interpret Clear that way though. I would have thought it was one of their more explicitly Christian songs? No criticism, actually wanting to hear your take :)"
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,candlesandfish,4,Thu Jul 9 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for replying with so much content! I love discussing the lyrical content of their songs and I'm always so happy to find someone willing to discuss it with me. Also, it helps that you have Christian background and you were able to clear a few things up for me. I grew up in a non-religious household so I was never exposed to Christian culture for the most part, so I think I miss a few references in TOP songs.  Anathema is one of my favorites, but I never fully grasped the meaning. I always knew it was about doubts, and I interpreted the majority of the verse as having a sort of depression that left you unable to deal with your problems in a healthy way (""It's said that a war's lead but I forget that I let another day go by""). I never understood the last part, ""Empty sky? No way, that's me"". What does he mean by he's the empty sky? I finally understand the other part of the last part though, so thank you for that! That makes the song a lot more meaningful.  I completely agree with everything you said about Be Concerned. You also cleared a few things up that I was confused about, like the pearl/swine reference and the last verse. I think it's really interesting that even though God is all forgiving, Tyler still doesn't think he's earned His love after having so many doubts.   For Clear, I'm just going to copy and paste what my interpretation was from my last comment:  For me, Clear seems like he's doubting harder than ever, and that he's afraid his Christian community is going to cast him out for questioning God's existence and not blindly following like you're supposed to. The second verse when he says ""Wanna know what I believe? It's right here, dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear"" is him saying that your meaning is right here aka inside of you. Interesting how it can have so many interpretations.  Also, the end verse can be interpreted in two ways as well.   I will tell you what I can,  But your mind will take a stand,  I sing of a greater love,  Let me know when you've had enough.   He wants to spread his beliefs that have helped him so much to others that may be resistant to them. But the real question is, what are his beliefs at this point? Has he gone back to placing his faith entirely in God, or has he decided that you have to find your own meaning? The ""greater love"" does seem to point to God, but it could also point to self-love, self-acceptance, finding your own purpose, etc.  That's my interpretation, but that's purely from a biased standpoint from someone who doesn't believe in God. But I'm still confused what ""God"" really means. I definitely believe in something. Well, sometimes. I think the universe responds well to positive energy and that kind of stuff. But I have doubts about that as well.  Growing up in a Christian neighborhood, I was often cast out for being different (gay and non-christian), so it put a bitter taste in my mouth and I never pursued any knowledge of the religion. Now that I'm older, I know that a good amount of Christians are loving and accepting, including people like you and Tyler, and it's made me interested once more. Not growing up around religion, I'm not sure if I could ever be religious, but I'm hoping to get more insight once I dig deeper into some more TOP lyrics.  Anyways, thanks so much for having this discussion with me. |-/"

But I have doubts about that as well.   That's totally fine. We all have doubts. I have days where I hate everything, even being alive. I have days where I doubt the existence of God and wonder why I bother, sometimes I think it would be easier to be a hedonist, and lose myself in not thinking. Who and what God is is something nobody can tell you to believe, and I’m not going to try. The clever thing about what Tyler’s saying here, is that he's asking the questions that might make someone search for God. And that's the only way to believe, to go looking for a power beyond the universe that we happen to believe loves us to the point of utter self sacrifice. For us, if you want to find God, you will.

I’m so sorry for how people have treated you. We can be awful, and we can ""eat our own”, too. It's not that long ago where Christians would dismiss the faith and “real Christianity"" of anyone with struggles or doubts or mental illness. Trust me, I know. But as you’ve seen, there are lots of us out here who are not like that, who love. If we’re called to the standard of self-giving, self-sacrificial love that I mentioned before (that “greater love”), then what else can we do? You don’t have to have grown up around religion, you don’t have to 'be religious', whatever that means to you, but honest searching will find you answers in the end. Feel free to PM me if you ever have questions you want answers to, even if it’s just looking to understand more Biblical allusions!

twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,circasurvivor1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! I just randomly stumbled upon this subreddit and read your post.  I thought I'd let you know that it is indeed possible to reliably experience extremely liberating experiences of selfless love, compassion, and happiness without having to believe in God or prescribe to any doctrine or religion. Look into metta meditation. Also, I'm not trying to convince you to not to be christian here, but from your post it seemed like you thought that giving up religion meant giving up spirituality and becoming a hedonist who doesn't think. This is definitely not the case. Spirituality is about understanding thoughts for what they truly are, not about giving up thinking. It is actually possible to have extremely liberating and empowering profound insights about the nature of your own mind by practicing meditation. And none of it requires a belief in God, not tha there's anything inherently wrong with it, just letting you know there is a path of spirituality without belief in any doctrine, since you seemed to express doubts and thought not believing in god would make you a hedonist.   :) I know most atheists give themselves a bad rep, but I hope you know it's possible to be a spiritual atheist. What inspired me to switch up my nihilistic outlook on this world was a book called Waking Up by Sam Harris, or, if you are religious, perhaps a book by Echkart Tolle will likely be more ""sensitive"". Regardless, experiencing deep truths about the mind and the vast possibilities of human well-being, is available to any of us without any need to adopt a new doctrine or ideology. It's just self-improvement. I hope you check some of this stuff out and practice meditating for yourself! It highly improves the quality of your mind, and thus your experience of this world. Just wanted to post this to let you know that there is a middle road. Not believing in God does not mean you are not spiritually connected to this world. In fact, it may actually increase your connection. You will learn to find true heaven (letting go of the ego) is accessible at any moment, you just have to learn the technique for attaining it."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,candlesandfish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:04:15 2015 UTC,"Hey :)  Thanks for the comment and the suggestions. I do meditate, actually, both in secular forms and religious, and find it very beneficial.  I do realise that there's a lot of ground between the two approaches. For the sake of the discussion (which is already two and a half walls of text) I tried to keep it simple, and I tend to explain my choices by extremes when doing that, although I'm well aware of the options in between that are available. I'm aware of spiritual atheists, I know a few of them myself, and I value their insights into life, even though we hold differing views on many things.   I think we can all agree that nihilism is bad. The music that this subreddit is about encourages us to break out of it, to think, to be awake and aware. There are people who listen to it and take religious meanings from it, there are people who can't see the religious meanings, there are some who interpret it their way despite being able to see the allusions put into the music. The band want people to interpret it for themselves, and that's what we do here.  A lot of Eastern Christianity talks about the letting go of the ego, it's a very old concept, and a lot of my spirituality is based around that. Finding true freedom and peace in the love of God rather than my own self and desires.  Feel free to stick around, definitely check out the music, and thanks for the comment :)"
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,circasurvivor1,2,Fri Jul 10 07:11:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot for your awesome reply. Will definitely check it now. :)"
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,candlesandfish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:19:19 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! It's great to talk about these things with people. And happy to clear up the religious references, too, there's heaps of them all through it, Tyler knows his Bible and knows more than just the passages most people know, and sprinkles references and metaphors everywhere.   Anathema is about a bunch of things. One of the things is wanting your anxieties, the thoughts, the voices, the depression, to go away. That's the surface reading. The last section is from another song, Blasphemy, and in Anathema it serves the purpose of taking the struggle with thoughts and applying it to his faith and to God.  ""It's said that a war's lead but I forget that I let another day go by"" is about the fight on a lot of levels. You're right in that it's about the depression not letting you do things, and you struggle but sometimes not much happens. It's also about the concept of ""spiritual warfare"" which is a Christian metaphor, talking about the Christian struggle as a war. The war is Christians & God versus the bad stuff, but it's also just a good metaphor for our struggles between the good and bad parts of ourselves. So the war is to fight the bad, to embrace the good, to fight the anxiety and depression, to do good in the world in our actions and fight the bad that happens in the world, and for Christians there's an understanding that there's more going on with all that than what we see (in angels and demons) as well, but our own fight is with what we do know, the stuff I mentioned above.    “I never understood the last part, ""Empty sky? No way, that's me"". What does he mean by he's the empty sky?”   “No way that’s me, that I think that, I can’t think that”, I think, is what that line means. It’s not super clear. And happy to help out with the Biblical allusion :) It is interesting that even though we know God is all forgiving that Tyler doubts that he’s still accepted and loved, but that's what anxiety does, isn’t it? It makes us think that nobody can care about us, that we're worthless, that nobody loves us, that we are too broken, too messed up. Of course, when we're healthier, we realise that's wrong, but in the moment, in that snapshot (as the other person commented) of his psyche, he’s convinced he’s gone too far. He’ll come out of it and sing of the opposite, elsewhere, if you know where to look for it.   For me, Clear seems like he's doubting harder than ever, and that he's afraid his Christian community is going to cast him out for questioning God's existence and not blindly following like you're supposed to. The second verse when he says ""Wanna know what I believe? It's right here, dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear"" is him saying that your meaning is right here aka inside of you. Interesting how it can have so many interpretations.   The first verse is about judgement from others, and about trying to figure out how to go about presenting the message he wants to show. Does he come out and yell it on a street corner and be obvious (and maybe not listened to) or is better to be clever, and “mask your words” - presenting the message (God’s words?) in a way that’s much more subtle, which is basically what he does most of the time. Clear is the most explicit of his songs with the ‘hey, I’m writing Christian things here, it's up to you what you do with them” message, actually, and the first two lines discuss the two approaches. The next couple lines talk about the fact that if he is understood to be presenting Christianity, and people find out what he did last night (whether it's sin or doubt or self harm) people will attack God and the message due to his failing to live up to the Christian ideal of perfection (which sane people realise isn’t possible in this life, but a lot of people still expect). Is he actually going to make it worse if he tries to talk about God to people, and they see his imperfections? Will they class him as a hypocritical Christian and judge God based on him?  I'm the son of all I've done, Impostor, Been fostered, Then my new father drained my dirty blood.   Redemption metaphor. In Christianity, we believe that as Christians we're adopted by God and become sons/daughters of God (as father) and brothers/sisters of Christ and each other. So when Tyler sings about “want[ing] to be a better brother better son” that's what he’s referencing. His past is what's made him what he is, the ""son of all I’ve done"", but his new father (God) drained his dirty blood (past, sin) and gave him health and life. Blood as redemptive metaphors are all through the Bible.  I'm not trying to be lying to you, But it takes a clever guy to do what I do, It takes some chivalry and well placed energy, To subliminally get yourself inside you, Introspection is the name of this session, Spread this infection, reflect it on the next one, The next one, the next one, and when we're done, We'll all have made something new under the sun,   This is as obvious as Tyler gets at telling us what he's up to. He's trying to get us to think about things, to be introspective, and that introspection spreads. And the “we’ll all have made something new under the sun” is a cheeky Ecclesiastes reference. Ecclesiastes is a book of the Bible which is very poetic and talks about the meaning of life...or it’s lack thereof! I’m not at all surprised that Tyler likes it. Here's the first few lines, which the quote is playing with:  “Vanity [or meaningless, or futility] of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” What profit has a man from all his labor In which he toils under the sun? One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever. The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose. The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit. All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; To the place from which the rivers come, There they return again. All things are full of labor; Man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing. That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, **And there is nothing new under the sun.** Is there anything of which it may be said, “See, this is new”? It has already been in ancient times before us. There is no remembrance of former things, Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after.   See what he did there? :D  I'm not done, I'm not done yet, no, Kick me off the stage and take my microphone, Then you'll walk up to me and when you get close, I'll look you in the face and say, ""Where's your home? Where are you going and why are you here?"" Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere? Want to know what I believe, it's right here, Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear.   Basically, when he's done singing, these are the questions. What’s your purpose? Why are you here? Where's your home? He’s trying to get people to ask those questions of themselves. And he’s got answers, if you’re willing to hear them.   Also, the end verse can be interpreted in two ways as well. I will tell you what I can, But your mind will take a stand, I sing of a greater love, Let me know when you've had enough. He wants to spread his beliefs that have helped him so much to others that may be resistant to them. But the real question is, what are his beliefs at this point? Has he gone back to placing his faith entirely in God, or has he decided that you have to find your own meaning? The ""greater love"" does seem to point to God, but it could also point to self-love, self-acceptance, finding your own purpose, etc.   This is him using an old teaching technique. If you ask people questions, they start to think, and they start to find the answers for themselves. He doesn't want to come out and tell them what to believe, but he wants people to start thinking about the important questions in life, and maybe they'll come to the same conclusions as him. His beliefs here are the greater love. This is another reference: “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” - John 15:13, it’s Jesus talking here…and what did He do? Another verse talking about that same love is here: “By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.” - 1 John 3:16. “Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear”, indeed.  (I'll put the rest in a second reply because I'm over the character limit)"
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,cocojackson,3,Thu Jul 9 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"The band isn't a Christian band. However, Tyler is a self proclaimed christian, and he lets that influence some of the lyrics he writes. Although a lot of people say that josh is religious as well, I haven't seen a case where josh has come off as religious or secular."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,bulletwords,2,Thu Jul 9 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"Probably tangential information at best, but if you look at Tyler's tattoos they affirm his faith (to me at least). Now, I've never met Tyler so my ideas are COMPLETELY speculative.  On his left shoulder is the cross tattoo, which obviously is a symbol of Christianity.  On his right bicep are (in Roman numerals) 43-16-33. I thought this might be indicative of John (43rd book of the bible) 16:33, the text of which you can find with a Google search. Finally, on his left forearm he has the lines tattooed, some of which are in a group of three, which people have taken to be the Father, Son, Holy Spirit.   Obviously these tattoos are personal and their specific meaning is only known to Tyler and those he has shared the information with, but these are my guesses."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,bulletwords,2,Fri Jul 10 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"Tyler is Christian, but that doesn't mean twenty one pilots is exclusively Christian music, is what I'm saying."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,bulletwords,2,Fri Jul 10 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry to misinterpret, I agree. Like I said, tangential info, lol."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,GoodnightTwinkletoes,2,Sat Jul 11 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"Haha, no problem! It was kind of a confusing post. But yeah, you're right, Tyler definitely lets his faith influence his lyrics, but I think he does a pretty good job of keeping it general for people of all faiths. There's definitely a few biblical references but I can relate to a ton of his music not being christian myself, and I think that's awesome."
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,candlesandfish,2,Sat Jul 11 04:33:03 2015 UTC,That's the best thing! He stresses so much that HIS meaning behind the lyrics matters far less than ANYONE'S specific interpretation of what the lyrics mean to them personally. And that's what's so beautiful about this band!
twentyonepilots,3cmmlh,trw931,2,Sat Jul 11 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"Your interpretations are very interesting. Tyler is definitely a Christian, but I don't think he's the kind of ""sit back, live your life how you want to, make sure not to be gay and go to church on Sundays"" kind of bigoted Christian most people are nowadays. He's the kind of Christian who, frankly, cares.  And when you start caring when it comes to religion, it's not easy. In fact, it gets really hard. When you start questioning what it means to believe in something that has no proof, you also start to doubt. A lot. And you waver, and you stray, and you get angry, frustrated, and depressed, and it's an ongoing thing for the rest of your life. And that's what I believe Tyler's songs, especially from Self-titled and Regional at Best, are. They're tiny snapshots into his psyche at any given moment, not just his ""set in stone"" opinion. These songs are a window into the mind of someone struggling with faith, and sometimes his view on the world and God may change mid-song. That's how it works. It's a constant back and forth of opinions and questions that will never have a clear answer. That's why I think I connect with Tyler's lyrics so well; I went through the same thing as him for a long time.  But if you notice, very rarely does Tyler force you to believe anything, or beg you to believe anything. The only instance I've noticed him doing this is in ""Clear,"" which, again, I think is another snapshot into his head. Sometimes, when you think you completely understand the world, you don't understand why people don't get it like you do. After all, it is ""crystal clear.""   No, Tyler doesn't expect you to believe what he does. After all, I'm not exactly religious myself, but I know exactly where he's coming from. I feel as if the Tyler's main ""message"" to whoever is listening is just to think. Start caring about where you are in life and what you believe, because we have one life and it's important. Maybe this life goes on after we die, but that's not really important right now. Just start thinking about what you're going to do before the grave. I think Tyler says it best during the last lines of the self-titled album:  ""Please think about why you can't sleep in the evening  and please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking  your soul knows Good and Evil  your soul knows both sides   and it's time you pick your battles  and I promise you this is mine.""  |-/"
twentyonepilots,3cnhcv,thepathofwisdom,4,Thu Jul 9 07:23:44 2015 UTC,"Stressed out is pretty easy, especially if you're not comfortable with opening the high hat yet, would be good practice for that.   If you're looking to move on to a little more challenging you should try out A car a Torch a Death, it doesn't change much but the beat is a little harder to start out with.  Car Radio, was actually pretty hard for me to learn at first, its not a normal song so getting your body to follow that rhythm is a little challenging but once you learn it, it's fun as hell.  Migraine is fun and maybe a little on the harder side as well.  You picked a hard drummer to try and Copy, Josh doesn't normally play ""simple"" beats. although there seems to be more simple ones on the new album.  Hope this helps!"
twentyonepilots,3cnhcv,Dab4294,3,Thu Jul 9 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"Drummer here! Learn the Run and Go. Much of it is simple straight quarter note beats to match the keyboard. Also, if you're a beginner, it'll be a good way to get used to opening the high hat for certain beats. Josh does it off of the quarter beats at times and also does in on the 1st and 3rd beats with the kick drum which will get you used to coordinating your feet.  A lot of this may seem difficult and awkward at first as a drummer, but it'll all help in the end!  Or you could just learn Truce. I'm playing it right now."

Personally, I think the Regional at Best versions are more inspirational because they show that you can get a big label's attention by just having a home studio and doing everything there no don't like the added percussion in the Vessel version of Trees, but I don't like the auto tune in the RaB version all that much, but I guess I'll have to live with that. The percussion in Vessel is mixed significantly louder than that of RaB, which I don't mind. The vocal performances on Vessel are also more tame whereas the deliverance on RaB is more raw and Tyler sounds less ""sane(?)"" on RaB. I'm not really sure how to describe it, but I kinda like it. Obviously all of the synths and stuff will have slightly better mixing and production on Vessel since it was recorded in a studio and professionally mastered, but Regional at Best will always have a very special place I my heart for sounded so raw. I'll finish the audio tracks I was working on in the morning and upload them then so that people can listen to the tracks simultaneously.   Tl;dr Vessel is more polished, but I love the raw sound of RaB especially visible in Tyler's vocal performances."

I have to agree i'm not a fan of the auto-tune in Lovely or Trees. And my theory on the added percussion was because before Vessel, there was more members than just Jersh and TyJo. So they amped up Josh's sick drumming? And that raw feeling does really give it a cool feeling."

twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,I_wanna_hammer,5,Mon Jul 6 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"Let me first say, that I love this album. But I completely understand where you are coming from. The thing that bothers me about this album is that it seems to be directed AT the clique, but secondhand produced and marketed for everyone else. I feel like the album is a sort of cry for help that the band desperately wants to avoid where they are inevitable going because the power of their local music will be lost. But they are stuck because the broader goal is to reach as many people as possible. I just wish the album was just Tyler and Josh laying down all of these ideas in a basement. I wish the album could have been released raw based on the demos recorded on the tour bus. I feel like that wold have been the true TOP shining through. I feel like blurryface is Fueled by Ramens attempt at coating TOP with gloss and production in an attempt to sell the cliques brand. The thing I loved about the the first two albums was that Tyler and Josh (and also the older two members) were still completely experimenting, which is why songs like Kitchen Sink and Anathema are the REAL songs that will never EVER get played on the radio. I want to hear heavydirtysoul and ride and all those songs with ONLY the band members amateurism. I enjoyed the lack of production knowledge because they messed around with sounds until it sounded right to them, not some producer."
twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,guitargodmartin,3,Mon Jul 6 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen a couple of reviews along these lines now, and I understand where they are coming from, but think they are mostly misguided due to a lack of context surrounding who Tyler and Josh are and what they are trying to do through their music.  The transition from cult/local artist to subversive/mainstream artist is a really tricky one to navigate. It requires that the message stay essentially the same while the delivery of that message transforms from something intentionally counter-cultural into something more accessible for the masses.  This video does a good job of explaining how that transition went down and what the core elements of their message are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gtbKNrJ7es  In this interview (especially starting at 5:34), Tyler explains his love-hate relationship with numbers-based markers of success, which is really important for understanding his beef with the music industry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrdY8f4mQO8  So historically, TOP's lyrics have been centered around internal struggle of trying/failing/learning to live in a way that is both selfless and authentic. Here's the thing: Blurryface is still about this same central topic. But focuses less on explicit, personal experiences and more on symbolic, universal experiences of feeling inadequate, being under pressure to conform, and wading through self-doubt: all of these representing barriers toward achieving the band's idea of a truly fulfilling life. Personally, I think that interpreting Blurryface correctly (especially by former fans who fear something has changed) requires the acknowledgement that they made this transition in order to be able to reach more people with the same core message...NOT so that they can be more famous, make more money, and put up a big metaphorical middle finger to the radio industry and/or all the people that doubted them over the years. Or, put more positively, Blurryface furthers TOP's long-stated goal of helping struggling young people find meaning and purpose in their lives through authentic community and artistic expression.  I don't want to presume too much here, but I think that having this story arc as a backdrop addresses most of the complaints you have about the album. The core struggle is not between TOP's style and the music industry. It's between true artistic freedom and insecurity (as represented by the Blurryface character). Tyler's issue with radio songs isn't that they are formulaic, boring, or cheesy. It's that they shamelessly feed the sort of irreverent ego that causes people with power to do terrible things. In other words, they encourage people to embrace their Blurryface rather than fight it. On a related note, the repeated references to the fact that everyone has problems are not intended to represent a limp, weak submission to the struggles that TOP has been talking about for years. On the contrary, they encourage us to acknowledge the reality of our individual situations and begin fighting our fears and insecurities head-on, beginning with finding solidarity with others who feel the same way.  Now when an album that is intentionally cryptic receives this much mainstream attention, it's inevitable that it gets misinterpreted to some extent. But that's just part of the cost of fame. It's why the theme of internal struggle is still woven throughout the Blurryface album (and Tyler's twitter account leading up to the release), even though the band has ""made it"" as measured by any external marker of success. For me and other fans who really like the album, the idiosyncrasies of the Blurryface album demonstrate Twenty One Pilots' unique ability to blend authenticity with agenda-driven lyrics; and also, in this case, to integrate healthy levels of self- and cultural-criticism into what is really a mainstream pop album.  I'd love to hear your feedback on this, especially whether or not this post helped you understand why many diehard fans love Blurryface so much!  TL;DR version: the backdrop of the band's story, along with their sometimes startling transparency in interviews throughout their transition from a local cult band to a major record label act to an industry-shifting force, shows that they are capable of staying true to their values and convictions while adapting their musical and lyrical style to become more accessible to the masses. This is really, REALLY exciting for fans (like me) who believe in what they think Blurryface represents :)  PS: this is my favorite review of Blurryface that I've seen so far...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBI8KvLgLeo"
twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,kdawg0707,3,Mon Jul 6 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"from a purely musical standpoint i feel like this album got to be a little more on the gritty side compared to Vessel.  don't get me wrong it's definitely still polished and everything, but if you watch interviews with Tyler right when Vessel came out there's some where he almost begs for you to check them out live if you think the album sounds too polished and it was clear he would've preferred more distorted tones (like the bass in Lane Boy) and the breakbeat ending of it.  While I think this Album is very purposefully radio friendly while poking at radio culture, i feel like no ones talking about why that is.  I think what Tyler and Josh want to do is show people that music on the radio can be catchy and great and STILL have meaning.  ""Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common i'm in constant confrontation with what i want and what is popping in the industry"" isn't meaning to say ""FBR is making me right hits"" it means he's walking the fine line of playing the industry game while ripping open the norms and expectations set for it.  i hope some of this makes sense but i've been thinking about all this for a while and i wanted to write it down somewhere"
twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,levankid,2,Tue Jul 7 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"It makes really good sense. I don't see them compromising for anything. Tyler's always been very savvy about trying to reach people through the methods he has, and I've no doubt he's got reasons for all the decisions he's made on this album."
twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,candlesandfish,2,Tue Jul 7 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"I think your opinions are valid, but the execution wasn't great. Reading it, I was feeling defensive for Tyler and Josh, like instead of just critiquing the music, you were also dogging on them, which isn't cool. Everyone's got their own opinions, I can really see where yours were coming from, but I felt like the tone of this was just very very negative towards Tyler and Josh as people and as artists, and I don't think that aspect added good things to the review"
twentyonepilots,3cbfj7,moistflop,2,Tue Jul 7 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood a lot of the lyrics you were criticizing. They don't have some sort of ""faux radio hate"" especially if you think saying ""oh man, this song probably won't be played on the radio"" equates to ""fuck the radio, man. just fuck it."""

twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,nateonsideways,4,Sat Jul 4 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That's a repeat pattern on blurry face. Instead of a third verse they take one line and repeat it a few times then go back into the chorus to wrap it up.

twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,Jowsten,5,Sat Jul 4 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"Look at the pattern of what happens with ""I've been thinking too much"" next time you listen, with the lyrics in front of you. The song starts with two voices, with the 'healthy' voice being dominant, and it's the 'I've been thinking too much I've been thinking too much I've been thinking too much' that then goes to 'help me' - the anxiety and then the overthinking then the stressing/obsessing over overthinking spiral happens there. By the end of the song, blurryface is much stronger and the 'healthy' voice is the one asking for help.  It's not just repetition for the sake of it."

I've given my own personal meaning to nearly every lyric on the album. I don't think tyler would ever write something that meant nothing. It's just I noticed that part of ride was similar to the part of heavy dirty soul and made that connection.   I say that I skip it not because I think it's a useless line but because of listening to it a million times that part doesn't have much ""sing along while alone in my car"" value for right now.

twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,MrPydog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"""Don't you test me though, just because I play the piano, doesn't mean I am not willing to take you down. I'm sorry."" from Not Today.  It's funny, ""Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit"" is my favorite line from the album.   I've always interpreted it as although a rabbit will always be able to out run a dog, it is still afraid of it and runs. Tyler is afraid of death despite the fact that it will never catch him, just as the dog will never catch the rabbit, yet both inspire running and fear."
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,bhughes5805,-5,Thu Jul 9 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"""Faith is to be awake"" Tyler sings a lot about religion, which I don't mind, but this is the only line that implies that religious people are superior in some way. He's basically saying if you're not religious you're asleep and blind to the ""truth""."
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,FullMetalGuitarist,23,Sat Jul 4 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. Tyler is religious, but I felt like he didn't mean faith in that sense. More like faith in anything. In the good or that you'll wake up tomorrow or that everything is going to be ok. Because to have faith in that sense just makes you human and if you didn't have faith in that sense, you'd just be kind of drifting through life. Or ""asleep"" That's how I interpreted it at least"
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,IAmABrandon,7,Sat Jul 4 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"If you're interpretation is correct that would definitely change my feelings towards it. I feel like if he wasn't referencing religion he would've chosen a different word, since faith is well known as having a religious connotation. I guess we'll never know for sure though."
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,FullMetalGuitarist,6,Sat Jul 4 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Ah. But that's the key. You're never supposed to know for sure because if you don't know for sure then there is always more room to ponder on it. I believe the same song says ""to think is to be alive""  That's one of the reasons why I love this sub. It's a place where we can wrestle with ideas and observe unique perspectives other than our own. Love a lyric or hate a lyric, it makes no difference because you interpreted for yourself. You've thought about it, and that's what's most important. That's what keeps us ""alive""   I'm not a fan of the religious undertones but I can always interpret them through my experiences and relate to them all the same even while recognizing obvious references toward religion."
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,Jowsten,2,Sat Jul 4 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"so, in the same way, you can basically say that if tyler meant faith religious, that he could've meant 'think' as the people who arent religious? like, if you have faith, you can be awake but not always alive, but if you think you're alive? (or just that with no religious connotation at all)"
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,sleepyanarchy,2,Sun Jul 5 21:48:34 2015 UTC,Well if I were to sit and really think of it he says that one thing is the next thing is the next thing and so on. So faith is to be alive once the chain is done. Which one could interpret that as a religious reference or as just a general idea of believing or fighting for something you believe in. I think even if a line has a clear religious influence that it doesn't mean there isn't something that can be taken away from it from non-religious people.
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,Jowsten,3,Sun Jul 5 23:26:14 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts as well. Not sure why FullMetal is being downvoted though. He's answering the question asked.
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,IAmABrandon,6,Sat Jul 4 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"People tend to downvote whatever they disagree with. Although I'd expect better from this sub, it doesn't really bother me. Just fake internet points. Plus I got to hear your alternative interpretation which is always interesting with TOP lyrics."
twentyonepilots,3c3lbc,FullMetalGuitarist,0,Sat Jul 4 22:53:36 2015 UTC,Most lyrics on Blurryface imo can be kinda corny sometimes
twentyonepilots,3c5f2v,open-aperture96,13,Sat Jul 4 23:38:56 2015 UTC,He had mentioned in an interview he likes doing it because it is more entertaining to watch than a stand up mic

twentyonepilots,3c5f2v,garebeargare,2,Sun Jul 5 07:12:44 2015 UTC,"During the Bonnaroo recording, the way Tyler approaches it and interacts with it does look like he's interacting with a noose instead of a mic."
twentyonepilots,3c5f2v,gropesarefordopes,2,Sun Jul 5 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sometimes the microphone looks like it's dangling from a hangman type structure which definitely gives it a noose like feel."

twentyonepilots,3c2mad,CertifiedRogue,7,Sat Jul 4 04:32:52 2015 UTC,And thats why he's taking his time on his ride. I've literally just been thinking about this. Ride is like a sequel to Car Radio in a way. :)
twentyonepilots,3c2mad,open-aperture96,3,Sat Jul 4 06:09:26 2015 UTC,Ride=Car=Life as a whole  Car Radio=Car Radio=The Happiness found in life.  Makes sense

twentyonepilots,3c2mad,thepathofwisdom,2,Sun Jul 5 05:59:54 2015 UTC,"Er, maybe you misinterpreted it.  Sure, it had one error (Car Radio=Car Radio, we know this), but he's using an analogy.   The car represents life as a whole.  So if Tyler is taking his time on his ""ride"" because he's ""falling"", that would mean he's driving slowly because, I dunno, he's dying? (I can't quite connect the dots there.)  So, if we tie Car Radio into this analogy, we understand that the Car Radio is life's happiness and distractions (hence ""There is no distraction to mask what is real""). This makes sense because people who are emotional will often turn to music to distract themselves from the feels, so when they can't do that, they sit alone with their thoughts and are forced to deal with themselves.   I can remember days when I felt so down that I would literally listen to Car Radio 10-15 times in one day. Don't laugh at me."
twentyonepilots,3c2mad,whydoieventryanymore,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:17:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's referencing another song, but rather connecting to the earlier lyric ""Yeah I think about the end just way too much, but its fun to fantasize.""  ""The end"" likely being death, which totally makes sense here. Death and depression are common themes in TØP's music, and when you start to really think about them sometimes it can be easy to get trapped in a cycle of your own thoughts (""thinking too much""), at which point you might naturally want someone to help you break out of your own head. Yet we still do think about death quite a bit, because when life hits you hardest, thinking of ending it can bring a strange and morbid kind of comfort (""its fun too fantasize"")."

twentyonepilots,3byazk,AllOfTheDerp,8,Fri Jul 3 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going to copy what wrote in another thread about this song. It's my interpretation of the song:      I think this song is very reminiscent (lyrically) of the songs on Vessel. Tyler is sort of a messenger who speaks on behalf of the people who can't or won't speak for themselves about their demons. ""Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man."" The comma is important here. You can hear it as both an attack on Tyler or an attack on what he's saying. Many people don't understand the intricacies and the seriousness of depression and its effects on those who suffer from it. Sometimes the way people talk about it is very insensitive or even flat out incorrect. I've had similar conversations myself.   This song feels very 'in-your-face' to me. Tyler is standing up for others and reminding them to remember the future. The future is bright. In the future joy can be found. Just hang in there.   Sometimes I wonder if Tyler writes about himself in the third person or about somebody he knows ( or knew...) who is suicidal. The verses of the song remind me of some older TOP stuff (references to day and night, masks, something to hide).  &nbsp;  To me it comes down to this:  You may think you understand me, think everything's fine, think you know what's going on, but there's so much more. I've harmed myself or others with this condition - a crime that keeps me on the run. Maybe I won't ever tell you. Maybe I'm embarrassed. Songs like this are sung by messengers for those who need it, who can't say something or won't say it. The message may come off as being ""emo"" or whatever, but that isn't right. These are real people with real problems. Do not sully their emotions or their lives. Do not mess with the message, man. You're messing with the Message Man. These are my people."

Before you continue on, please read through that link.  Alright, so I don't think /r/twentyonepilots will shut down and here's why: The main reason for the shutdown is due to Victoria's surprise departure, which this subreddit is unaffected by since TOP (or Josh Dun at least) is capable of using Reddit without the help of Victoria. The other reason for the shutdown is a lack of communication between mods and admins.

twentyonepilots,3bv8nx,xReactivity,12,Thu Jul 2 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"EDIT: FLAC Rip here: https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/3byh5e/regional_at_best_flac/ (Even higher quality thanks /u/schneidmaster)  I noticed that the version on the wiki (here) is only a 192kbps .mp3, so I decided to search for another version of Regional at Best. I found both a 320kbps .mp3 version and a 251-276kbps .m4a version (originally from iTunes). After comparing all three versions (gallery here), it was apparent that the 320kbps version isn't true 320kbps, and the .m4a version is the version with the best quality. Since we don't have a FLAC version (yet; two people on this subreddit have said they'd rip it when they get the chance, so fingers crossed <3) I thought I'd upload this so that people could here a slightly higher quality version of Regional at Best.  tl;dr iTunes version of Regional at Best, which is the best version currently available online, and it's better than the one on the wiki."

twentyonepilots,3bw2wx,xReactivity,6,Thu Jul 2 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the Lane Boy music video is dropping on Sunday because in the show they did on 6/30 at Red Bull Sound Space At KROQ (You can watch it here thanks to /u/cocojackson), Tyler said, ""Look out for a music video for this one very very very soon,"" (~24:46) during their performance of Lane Boy. All of the other music videos for this album have dropped on Sundays, so I'm assuming this one will too."

twentyonepilots,3bw2wx,inoahlot4,5,Thu Jul 2 22:26:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, so obviously WDBWOT is about dreams and what not, but everyone is speculating about who he's talking about in the chorus part:    ""I need to know, that when I fail, you'll still be here - Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds and we'll money selling your hair - I don't care what's in your hair, I just wanna know what's on your mind - I used to say I wanna die before I'm old, but because of you I might think twice.""  So my theory is that it's not about one specific person. The first part is about Josh Dun ( up until we'll make money selling your hair), and the second part is about his wife.  This makes complete sense. Obviously they're selling Josh's hair because it's in the red mohawk and that's pretty awesome and makes some money.  But after he says ""make money selling your hair"", the music changes. Josh stops drumming (maybe signaling a switch from talking about Josh) and starts playing the trumpet (maybe the sweet sound of the trumpet represents his wife). The second part of the chorus makes much more sense when talking about his wife than Josh Dun.  There's even another clue for this theory during the second time singing this chorus, when he says ""but I don't care what's in your hair"". He includes a ""but"" in only the second time maybe signaling a change in who it's talking about."
twentyonepilots,3bw2wx,memeshay,4,Thu Jul 2 23:42:06 2015 UTC,I have a theory that the band is called twenty one pilots because there are 21 pilots in Josh and Tyler controlling them.

For my small circle of friends who are in the Clique, this lyric has become sort of a motto to us. Just wanted to share my story with you guys and why these words mean so much to me!

I remember one being vessel, isle of flightless birds, anathema, mad world and street poetry.   Another time they played Vessel, forest, time to say goodbye, fall away, and addict with a pen.   The videos on YouTube are mostly from festivals so they can't play too much because other bands have to go on, so if it's not a festival then expect a large amount.

Of course he's probably best known for his more dramatic (but still comedic) role of Saul Goodman these days, but he has a background in comedy. He and David Cross had a sketch comedy show called ""Mr. Show"" years ago, and he also produced, acted in, and I think wrote for another sketch comedy show called ""The Birthday Boys"" which you can checkout on Netflix if your interested in seeing some examples of his comedic style (that is, unless it's just not to your tastes, which is fine).

I had just recently been struggling staying focused on school and had dropped my classes to work full time. My parents weren't all that happy about that.     I want to drive away In the night  Headlights call my name  I'll never be, be what you see inside You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified  You say that you are close Is close the closest star?  You just feel twice as far You just feel twice as far     That song had been my favorite on the album for quite some time, but for some reason the timing of this was so perfect. I had been really depressed and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Music has always been an escape for me and I feel like a totally different person when I play. My family appreciates my music but doesn't really understand my desire to pursue it.   I can pretend like everything is fine while I'm at school or work and fake you out when I get home. I'll never be what you think I'm going to be. You tell me that everything is going to be alright but it doesn't feel comforting. You feel distant. Maybe my brain is sick.     That's okay."

The thing is, I don't think there are any TOP songs with actual official choreographies. This meant that I had create my own. So I sifted through many of their songs and thought about ideas of what I could do. I ended up choosing Anathema since I figured I could do something ... idk, something emotional. After I figured out and planned what I wanted to do during the song, I practiced and finally recorded my performance for Anathema lol. I called it performance because I really didn't know what else to call it lol, but really I just wanted to share with people something I created--that's why I shared it here :) Again, sorry for not giving any context in the first place XD Hopefully this explains it :P"

It would be an incredible way to close off their headline sets. I doubt it'll ever happen though; Tyler likely wants to keep it something that people can only experience in recorded form.
twentyonepilots,3b97m8,deeninetysix,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:57:25 2015 UTC,Why would he want to keep it as something people can only experience in recorded form? He said in the spotify track commentaries for Vessel that his favorite thing is playing songs live and that it is hard for him to attach to a song that they don't play live. I would be really disappointed if they don't play it live when I see them. I think it would close their set magnificently.

The blurry face character gives meaning to this with wanting to defeat this alter ego that wants to give into insecurities but instead of defeating this blurry face, the narrator seems to be pleading with it.

twentyonepilots,3b5tdn,Schmedly27,11,Fri Jun 26 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"Heads up: this is long, partly because I reformatted the lyrics to show how I view the structure of the song.   One of the most interesting things in this song for me is the 'two faces' thing being done again in a more subtle way. So you've got two voices happening in each line a lot of the time. Let me map it out the way I see it:  I just wanna stay in the sun where I find              |           I know it's hard sometimes   Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind            |          I know it's hard sometimes   Yeah, I think about the end just way too much      |           But it's fun to fantasize   On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was            |            But it's fun to fantasize  Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Taking my time on my ride    ""I'd die for you, "" that's easy to say   We have a list of people that we would take   A bullet for them, a bullet for you   A bullet for everybody in this room   But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through   See many bullets coming through   Metaphorically, I'm the man   But literally, I don't know what I'd do   ""I'd live for you, "" and that's hard to do   Even harder to say when you know it's not true   Even harder to write when you know that tonight   There were people back home who tried talking to you   But then you ignored them still   All these questions they're for real like   Who would you live for? Who would you die for? And would you ever kill?    Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Taking my time on my ride    I've been thinking too much   I've been thinking too much   I've been thinking too much   I've been thinking too much            |            (Help me)   I've been thinking too much            |           (I've been thinking too much)   I've been thinking too much            |            (Help me)   I've been thinking too much            |            (I've been thinking too much)   I've been thinking too much    Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time   Taking my time on my ride  Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride   Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my    I've been thinking too much            |           Help me   I've been thinking too much            |            Help me  I've been thinking too much            |            (I've been thinking too much)   I've been thinking too much            |            (Help me)   I've been thinking too much            |            (I've been thinking too much)   I've been thinking too much            |           Help me    So, having formatted that that way, you can hopefully see what I'm getting at. On the record, it falls just before the explicitly two-sided Fairly Local where we see the two faces, but this for me is where he starts listening to the voices. And the transition comes halfway through the song.   So in the beginning you essentially have two first verses.   ""I just wanna stay in the sun where I find  Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind  Yeah, I think about the end just way too much  On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was""  which seems like normal thinking, but the second voice is the intrusive thoughts - self pity, invitation to fantasise on the end, sung in a different style. Then we go into the chorus, about falling, which usually refers to giving into doubts and thoughts in Tyler's lyrics, and for me are signifying the spiral down. The rap section discusses the uncertainties and the doubts in yourself and what you'd do for yourself and others, and whether you're a hypocrite for what you say and do, and the thoughts get the better of him, and the chorus returns to a further spiral into thoughts and doubts, and he sings about how he's been thinking too much, as a repetitive panicky worry, and while it begins as a single voice, the second one sings 'help me' and after that there's two voices singing the 'i've been thinking too much' refrain, and just the one singing 'help me'. (Is blurryface joining in with the panicky 'I've been thinking too much'? What do you think?)  Then we go back to the refrain with multiple voices again, and end with 'help me', unlike the previous refrain which just ends with the 'I've been thinking too much'. Obviously by the end of the song Tyler needs help.  In the beginning verse the two voices are Tyler vs intrusive thoughts/blurryface, suggesting. The refrain is the opposite, with the thoughts/blurryface dominating, with the 'help me' refrain as a response, and the final words of the song.  The fact that we then go into explicit 'blurryface vs Tyler' verses in Fairly Local makes me think that this is where the issues that have been discussed in the previous songs start to actually impact and send him spiralling into the storyline of the rest of the album and its struggle between the two."

twentyonepilots,3b5tdn,SnapKreckelPop,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:02:08 2015 UTC,"Tyler and Josh really nail their core elements on this one. The vocals, drums, bass and keyboards works wonders together. The beat to the chorus is so subtly simple, and with the ""wah wah"" over the top, makes it so catchy.  I also think with the prominent sound of the bass guitar, Tyler is taking a step in a really cool new direction (possibly to be used on future tracks as well?).  This track is really evident to TØP's ability to recognise the need to evolve as a band; something that I feel a lot of other artists fail because of their stubbornness to ignore the latter. The lyrics, however, remain loyal to the original sound, something we're all glad about I'm sure. Easily my fave track. Gr8 m8 8/8."

In the phrase ""everything but the kitchen sink"" it is implied that a person takes or wants almost everything. If Tyler is in fact referencing this phrase then he is referring to everything else. That sounds weird so I'll explain what I mean...     By saying ""I'm a kitchen sink,"" he is saying that I'm the thing that is unsure or doesn't really serve a purpose to you or him or her. In a way, he would still not know what that even really means. What is important to him is maybe not important to you. He's searching for purpose. Purpose to him might not be purpose to you. What purpose does this kitchen sink have? Who knows?  This certainly doesn't answer the question of what a kitchen sink is to Tyler. However, it doesn't really matter. A kitchen sink to Tyler four years ago might not be a kitchen sink to Tyler today.     That's just my take on it anyway. I'll keep searching for purpose."
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,Block_After_Block,17,Thu Jun 25 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"Tyler answered what a Kitchen Sink is to him in their AMA on /r/Music    One of the reasons why I started writing music in the first place was to address some of these big questions I had. One of them being ""what's the point?"" I know it sounds dramatic, but it's something that was haunting me - what's the point of everything that we do? Really looking for purpose is a huge reason to exist. So I found that creating something that only you understand can be the beginning of purpose for you. So for me, something important in my life happened to me at a kitchen sink. And in my darkest hour, when deciding whether or not to continue or not, I realized that if I don't continue, no one will be around to explain what that lyric means. So it... helps me. So creating something whether it's a journal, or a piece of artwork, something that you don't reveal the meaning of, can help you know that if you leave, no one will be around to explain this. So in short, I'm not going to tell you what that kitchen sink means to me because I need it to be only known by me.    Link to question.  So I don't think Josh knows what a Kitchen Sink is to Tyler."
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,_Jory_Cassel,5,Thu Jun 25 06:03:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, now that we are on this subject, I have always heard the lyrics as ""at my kitchen sink"" but this sub always says ""I'm a kitchen sink"" as well as lyrics websites. When I read this on the AMA, it lead me to believe that I was right. I've always felt connected with that line because I've been at my kitchen sink many times before with a knife in my hand, knowing I wasn't going to do anything but also knowing that I could if things got too hard. It's important for me to say that I grabbed the knife not with those intentions, it would be me going through my day and suddenly I would wash dishes and come across a knife, the thought would just hit me... 'I could.' So being at a kitchen sink... I don't know, it reminds me of taking control of my life even when having the tools and capability to destroy it were at my disposal.  So what are the frikin lyrics?! I don't know, the personal connection of being at MY kitchen sink will likely always have me singing my ""misheard"" lyrics."
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,meagan51422,3,Thu Jun 25 07:16:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely ""I'm a kitchen sink"" no doubt about that"
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,thepathofwisdom,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:10:45 2015 UTC,Well I would consider him saying he was at a kitchen sink in his AMA as doubt.
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,meagan51422,5,Thu Jun 25 12:23:41 2015 UTC,"You can consider that as your doubt, but the lyric is still definitely ""I'm a kitchen sink"""
twentyonepilots,3b0ifs,thepathofwisdom,0,Thu Jun 25 12:28:53 2015 UTC,"There's honestly no reason to to get worked up over it, calm down. My only point is that I would like to see a copy of the lyrics book since some lyrics website write ""at"" and some write ""I'm a."" When sung, they sound pretty similar, I could see it likely being the other one. I only rekindled the thought when I read it in the AMA because he sure makes it sound like the lyrics are him being at his kitchen sink."

twentyonepilots,3b07lr,ASovietSpy,11,Wed Jun 24 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"I myself wondered this as well , so I went to a source. I told my brother to not let me forget to ask Tyler when we meet him. Then I met him, and basically was in shock so said great show got a picture and that was a rap. So fast forward I met him a second time I was much more comfortable talking to him. So I even asked him to make a personalized video for my son which he totally did for me. Got an autograph, chatted it up about the show. But this time as he said all set guys, and started walking to the bus, my brother shouted ask him dude. I sorta shouted Hey Tyler!, he turned, and said what's up ? So i asked him ""Hey your from Ohio so why do other countries get the bonus tracks?"" He sorta smirked and threw his hand up in the air by his face in a Tyler voice, and said ""Aggh, Ugh I don't know man you gotta ask the label, I just don't know."" So to some up my story it's definitely record label thing. Tyler is such a down to earth cool dude so humble to fans."
twentyonepilots,3b07lr,rocarmy,5,Thu Jun 25 04:10:38 2015 UTC,"songs are released on different days in different countries in an attempt to get  better chart placement.  http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2010/09/08/129725205/why-albums-are-released-on-tuesdays  Japan tends to have more bonus tracks to entice people not to import the album, because albums are cheaper in japan if imported.  http://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2kvh0y/why_do_japanese_versions_of_albums_get_more_bonus/  It also comes down to what the regional copyright holder / label decides to include on the album, and what they think is best. I read online that tyler and josh didn't even know the 2014 Japanese version of vessel even existed until someone asked to get it signed.  Also using your logic, as a pure marketing tactic, if we assume Americans buy the most amount of twenty one pilots cd's, releasing a deluxe version in another country leads to fans in the US buying the CD more than once, increasing album sales."
twentyonepilots,3b07lr,cocojackson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I wonder why albums are so expensive in Japan."
twentyonepilots,3b07lr,rocarmy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:31:16 2015 UTC,Your so correct because I bought both releases from the UK as well. Vessel was actually delayed in UK the US had it before them. Then Blurryface was 1 day earlier than US. It will never will make any sense unless your in the labels shoes.

However what I think bars me from viewing it as a mainly concept album is the sense of how tracks are ordered should create some sort of overarching dynamic or progress a line of thinking/thematic elements to communicate a broad message. People may interpret the album that way ( in not the best at interpreting music, lots of stuff goes over my head), but I don't see it as that. If someone would like to analyze the album for overarching idea that would be cool, something I would really enjoy reading."
twentyonepilots,3atvg6,YourSweetSummerChild,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"I think you can definitely see an overarching idea in both blurryface and vessel, but what it doesn't have that I think help defines a concept album is a sense of progression or story. With ToP it's more like the layers begin to fall away and you see the whole message the more you listen whereas in more standard concept albums there seems to be more of a narrative of sorts. My best example of this is American Idiot from Green Day where the narrative was so explicit they made a musical out of it. I dont think you could ever do that with Vessel or Blurryface.

I would be very grateful for the older church CD's, RAB, and anything else that you have in a lossless format.   If you don't want to install any other programs and already have itunes installed, you can literally do it in just two steps.    Just choose Preferences from the iTunes menu and click the General tab.  To change the import settings, click on the appropriately named Import Settings button. In the resulting Import Settings window you can choose Apple Lossless Encoder or WAV Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu to get lossless quality.    Insert the music CD and it will ask to import. Import it and copy the music files to a file storage site like http://www.dropbox.com   Adapted from the first two steps here. The third step isn't necessary for music CD's: http://www.macworld.com/article/1156861/howto_rip_cds.html"

twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,xReactivity,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want to ruin the magic, but nothing here is more high-quality. You're just importing the album into Spotify, which plays back your local files instead of the album that is unavailable. No unlocking, just playing back yours instead. These are your files, no change in quality whatsoever, that's impossible as the original tracks aren't up anymore. If you just want to listen on Spotify, though, this is a great guide, I do this with all unavailable/taken down albums."
twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,wolflambert,2,Tue Jun 23 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"did you test this? Can someone with a PC try transcoding RAB to like 64 kbps, matching it, and see if spotify plays it at a decent quality?"

twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,2unlit2quit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you're wrong. These aren't the local files if you go to the greyed out album as I instructed. Normally greyed out songs just mean they aren't available in your region. For some reason, Spotify left up the entire album, they just region-locked it from the entire planet. Bizarre, but true; these are higher quality.  Perhaps you didn't follow the instructions properly. You have to use the greyed out songs, which are accessible after importing local files to a public playlist.  Edit: spelling mistake"
twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,xReactivity,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"Normally even if an album is region locked, the local files are still the ones played — if I edit something and import it for an album that's unavailable, it'll still be the edit. Unless this is an exception compared to all of Spotify I don't see this being higher quality. (Oh and I've used Spotify long enough to know how local files work.)  EDIT: no no if you import local files they also impact album pages. The local file icon doesn't show, but they're there."
twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,2unlit2quit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"Unless, of course, you can still play back the greyed songs after you remove the files imported to Spotify. Is that the case?  EDIT: and if it is, there's no need for telling people to import the whole thing. You could just share the Spotify URI of the hidden album.  EDIT 2: I just tried this, after removing the files but keeping the album it's not playable, which means the local files are clearly the ones being played back."
twentyonepilots,3ar7nf,xReactivity,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"In that case, could the issue be that you're using your own, edited files?

My interpretation: When he talks about his ""hometown"" in this song, he is referring to a darker place in his life. There are demons waiting for him there and calling to him but he knows that he can't go back to it. The reason that he makes this song about a ""hometown"" is because to most people your hometown is a place of comfort, so while he might want to go back to his darker ways because they are more comfortable than having to like a better way. UMMM, this most likely has to do with religion and Christianity like when you follow Christ you have to live outside your comfort zone, living outside of where you came from in the past(AKA your hometown) and living in a new way that honors Christ.

Quite literally, we have a lot of cloudy or overcast days. More often during the fall and winter months, but you could actually go days or sometimes weeks without seeing direct sunlight.  But the rest of the lyrics make me think they grew up in this city or region, and had certain beliefs or understandings about something, or a lot of things. After getting out and experiencing other parts of the country and the world, they realize how inaccurate those views or understandings are. Now with a much clearer understanding, they realize how everyone from this area are really ""in the dark"" on a certain topic.  Having moved away on my own for a few years, and returned, I can say I've noticed things that are so different in other parts of the country than here.

However, I am aware that I can be shitty at making tutorials, so I'll try to help out.  Are you using the files from the wiki that I linked? I've only tested it with those songs, so there's a chance that if you're using a different copy of the songs, it may not work. Just making sure.  Second of all, maybe make a fresh playlist. Create an entirely new one, named ""Regional At Best"", and add them there. Then try playing them within there, clicking the album and making it work from there, etc. Even if you don't have access to a song, you'll be able to add it to a playlist, it just won't play. This is my best guess at what your problem may be. Also, make sure the playlist is public.  It's hard to help with a problem that I don't have, so I'm not really sure, sorry. Worst situation, maybe delete the REB songs you currently have on your computer, and clear it all from your Spotify, and try again.  Let me know if things still aren't working after that!"

Their volumes aren't perfectly matched. The part to which you're referring (At least I think that's the part) where one is being screamed and the other sung is the exact same on both versions of the song: Here in the NPI version at 2:54 - 3:00ish you can hear the the word ""Hello"" is both sung and scream at the same time And here in the RaB version you can hear the ""Hello"" being both sung and screamed at the same time (54:01-54:05). The intro chords are the exact same (or my ears don't work well.)   To me they still sound identical.  EDIT: I made a thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/3alv7s/proof_that_the_npi_rab_trees_are_the_same_song/ I mixed the two and fixed the sync issues, and it sounds just like one song.

twentyonepilots,3ai3hr,edn-,5,Sat Jun 20 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"I've heard this version of lovely and I like it a lot more than the other version, I'm really not a fan of the effects on the vocals."
twentyonepilots,3ai3hr,YourSweetSummerChild,2,Sat Jun 20 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"The bonus track / deluxe version of Vessel is what you're looking for, features these songs."
twentyonepilots,3ai3hr,2unlit2quit,2,Sat Jun 20 11:43:47 2015 UTC,Any clique member in the UK willing to help me break some rules to get the bonus track version?
twentyonepilots,3ai3hr,YourSweetSummerChild,3,Sat Jun 20 22:07:49 2015 UTC,I've uploaded them here in FLAC before. I don't think it's really against the rules since it is the exact same audio as RAB and RAB is in the sidebar already. You can get it from the sidebar or if you really want it in FLAC i'll grab you the link in a few minutes. It really is the exact same.   edit: here's the link  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k2j4kvqcmxq23ve/AADqpobIX5xgkyO9BSOM3721a?dl=0

I do have RAB, but was interested in finding the redone versions. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but the only downloads I'm seeing over on the downloads section are the RAB versions"
twentyonepilots,3ai3hr,YourSweetSummerChild,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:16:51 2015 UTC,Do you have RAB in FLAC? I tried to analyze them but I was comparing the lossy RAB version to my exact audio copy of the UK Vessel bonus tracks and they looked pretty much the same but the FLAC ones were higher quality of course.

twentyonepilots,3akn6x,Zugunfall,4,Mon Jun 22 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to look at the clique as a whole and what the clique represents. I don't have as much time to look up everything on twenty one pilots as I may like, but I've heard about and seen the outrage of some bad new fans. How they're bad or fake or whatever, I have no idea. I don't think I will have any idea of that until maybe the day I see them in concert on this next tour, if at all.   No new fan is worse than an old fan, correct. But you and me who have been fans for a couple years now know what this fanhood stands for. It's cheesy, but it's kind of up to us to pass that down."
twentyonepilots,3akn6x,escapismsfinest,4,Mon Jun 22 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that the fan base is spreading rapidly. Anyone who knows me, knows that I was a fan before it was ""cool"". And besides, my daughter is one of those teenage tumblr girls and she is a genuine fan of TØP."

Sure you're from different backgrounds, but I bet you'll find they generally listen for mostly the same reasons as you. Instead of being a dick, try reaching out to these people."
twentyonepilots,3akn6x,Swagwise,-1,Mon Jun 22 11:12:15 2015 UTC,I do reach out and talk to them. I do blog on tumblr and see that the majority of these new fans are very literally phonie. I interact with them and want to vomit.
twentyonepilots,3akn6x,makeoutcreeks,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:07 2015 UTC,"I kind of see where you're coming from; it's frustrating going on Tumblr and seeing younger fans only talking about how cute Tyler and Josh are and calling Tyler ""tiny bean"" and all this other stuff that trivializes what their music stands for. It's annoying at best, but don't let it ruin your experience with the band, you know? And as Tyler explained once in an interview, there are fans out there who don't know how to properly express how they feel towards the band, so they do some crazy things. I think it's unfair of you to invalidate these ""angsty teenage Tumblr girls"". The band doesn't have much of a teenage appeal unless you do have a connection with the lyrics, so these fans you're calling fake must have SOME reason to listen to the band. If they didn't, they'd go fangirl over One Direction or 5SOS or something."
twentyonepilots,3aeraj,Exospheric-Pressure,2,Fri Jun 19 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"I recall this time where I attempted to watch a video, and the ad playing beforehand wasn't so much an ad as it was the ENTIRE music video for Such Great Heights by the Postal Service. I love the song, but I still skipped because what the actual fuck.  I just wanted to get that off my chest. Sorry..."
twentyonepilots,3aeraj,Block_After_Block,2,Sat Jun 20 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting marketing strategy. Why can't they just make an ad for the band itself instead of just releasing the whole music video in an ad? It's odd.   Still, pretty cool about Tear in My Heart"
twentyonepilots,3agjwd,DummiesBelow,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, nice work! This sort of reminds me of the visuals they used on the background screens during their last tour."
twentyonepilots,3age00,Mission_Mike,10,Fri Jun 19 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the atmosphere that Tyler, Josh, and the Fans have created together with the clique, but that doesn't mean anyone who wants to be a fan of TOP has to abide by the cliques ways. Some people just want to listen to music they like."
twentyonepilots,3age00,revatron,2,Sat Jun 20 05:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think that most people would agree with that, it's just that there have been a lot of ""new fans"" who act pretty disrespectful in general. It's just disappointing when a few people cause a toxic atmosphere for the rest of thr fans. But the clique has always been very resilient."
twentyonepilots,3age00,micahjahns,9,Sun Jun 21 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"It's a thing that happens with every growing band. I think a good/OTT example of this would be Arctic Monkeys. In the early days, they had a dedicated group of fans believe it or not, but after their AM release, many people will only know some stuff off of that, making it harder to find the other fans who know  the older stuff.  When they played Reading Festival last year, I can almost gurantee at least half of the people had turned up just for the experience  Tiptoed carefully around the use of ""genuine fan"" terminolgy here"
twentyonepilots,3age00,grimApocalypse,3,Fri Jun 19 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand this argument. Arctic Monkeys have been huge in the UK ever since I Bet That You Look Good On the Dancefloor, and every one of their albums has been number 1 on the charts. It's hardly as if they're some kind of indie band that's only just hit the mainstream, save for maybe in the US."
twentyonepilots,3age00,JimJamBimBam,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with those just there for the experience; some live acts can be pretty amazing even if you don't know the band, and it's a good way to get exposed to new music."
twentyonepilots,3age00,smahoogian,-5,Sat Jun 20 03:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yea I get where you are coming from. I think that is the thing that gets me is that it is going to be hard to distinguish the very ""into it"" fans from those who are there for the experience. My hope is that those who are there for the experience will become the ""into it"" fans."
twentyonepilots,3age00,MFaith93,11,Sat Jun 20 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it matters if they really understand the meaning. Fans are fans...i've never heard anyone speak about the ""quality"" of fans."
twentyonepilots,3age00,focketeer,0,Sat Jun 20 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"fans that relate to the lyrics and like it for the meaning put into it v.s. fans that just like how it sounds, completely ignoring the meaning of the songs. the songs are up to interpretation, but just liking the sound and not the emotion, in my opinion, reduces music from an art form, to just sound"
twentyonepilots,3age00,micahjahns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why this opinion seems so unpopular, but I agree with you. People can be casual fans, and that's okay, but I feel like they should (with any band) make some kind of effort to understand what the band represents and what the fan base stands for. Especially with twenty one pilots, where the message and philosophy of the band takes such a high priority in their music. I guess it can be frustrating when the message of the band means so much to you, but then you see people completely ignore it."
twentyonepilots,3age00,MFaith93,-11,Sun Jun 21 18:28:05 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it does matter if they understand the meaning. If certain fans listen to the music but don't understand what its about and don't represent what the music stands for, it give a bad rep to the fan base and the meaning of the music."
twentyonepilots,3age00,MyShadows,6,Sat Jun 20 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"Well it's not like there's one right meaning. People interpret music in different ways. Even if some people dont represent what the music stands for (whatever you think that is) that doesn't give the fans as a whole a ""bad rep."""
twentyonepilots,3age00,micahjahns,6,Sat Jun 20 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this. I had great experiences meeting with other fans prior to the Vessel release. It added a new dynamic to their shows in that it made you feel like you were apart of this family.  Post-Vessel it felt like new fans were there only because they are the new 'IT' band and they wanted to force themselves into the experience that they've been hearing so many positive things about. At a recent show I had someone snatch my brand new merch hat off of my head and throw it into the abyss, just because I was standing in front of them and they wanted me out of their way... This new selfish group of fans really ruined what I thought the live shows were all about."
twentyonepilots,3age00,petrichors,2,Sat Jun 20 07:55:06 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is what I was talking about with the quality of the fans. I encountered some of these fans at their Bonnaroo show this past week and honestly I was very surprised.
twentyonepilots,3age00,micahjahns,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:30:05 2015 UTC,"I've been to two of their concerts, in 2013 and 2014, and I thought the atmosphere of the fans was pretty friendly overall (obviously there were a few obnoxious people). But the second concert had a pretty bad atmosphere that really disappointed me. People were pushing and crowding together really close even though there was plenty of room, just to be an annoyance. I don't have an issue with smoking weed in general I suppose, but there were so many people lighting up constantly all around me that it felt pretty uncomfortable. Eventually me and my group got so claustrophobic and annoyed that we pushed our way out to the way back where there was actually room (about a half hour before tøp actually came on stage.) After we got to the back, things were very enjoyable from then on out, and the people around us seemed like very dedicated and friendly fans.  My brother was with me, and he goes to a lot of concerts and said that he has never had that kind of negative experience at any of them, but I'm guessing we just were unlucky and got stuck around a bad group of people. Either way, the show was still sick as frick."
twentyonepilots,3age00,nevercomemonday,8,Sun Jun 21 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think you need to understand that someone who enjoys a few TOP songs they discovered in 2015 is just as a fan as you or I. You're making yourself look pretentious, and frankly, the elitist attitudes of some fans are more concerning than their new popularity. Embrace the fact a band is going places and getting well-deserved fame.   Also, they're a band, not a cult.  Fans not ""upholding morals and attitudes""? Like, really?"
twentyonepilots,3age00,nightjesus,2,Sat Jun 20 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"I would agree that fans are fans, whether they know every song or only a few, but there are some who are more emotionally invested and connected to the music than others.  A huge part of the band's message is fighting off your demons and being a friend to everyone, especially those who are struggling and just need someone to listen to them. It can be frustrating when fans disregard this message (it is a kind of moral obligation) and are disrespectful or insensitive to people who really need support."
twentyonepilots,3age00,thefakemattk,0,Sun Jun 21 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"Look at MyShadows comment and the experience he/she describes. This is that I am referring to about some of the new fans. I've seen them 5 times now and my most recent (Bonnaroo) was different from all the others, and not in the greatest way.  MY goal here isn't to sound pretentious, so my apologies if that is how I came across."
twentyonepilots,3age00,jtparker2705,3,Sat Jun 20 13:34:38 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying and I think for me it's easy to want to keep TOP to myself to try to ensure that things stay the way they've always been. I'd like to keep the intimate feel of this fan base, I'd like to keep this kind of exclusivity that used to come with being a fan.   So yeah, in a way it makes me sad that everything is being opened up to a whole set of people but at the end of the day, that's just what happens when a band gets more recognition. This isn't an exclusive club and Tyler and Josh want us to share this music with as many people as we can because they want their music to help other people, even if it's just one line on one song and the person could care less about the rest.   And who knows, maybe some of the people we find a little annoying will leave just a quickly as they came once things change again and something more shiny comes along. I doubt those people will be around forever."
twentyonepilots,3age00,wolflambert,3,Sat Jun 20 14:30:28 2015 UTC,New fan here; I've known about TOP for a year but never actually listened to their songs until I saw Tear in my Heart on the charts on iTunes. Since then I've been addicted. I've never had an album like Vessel or Blurryface pull me in like it has for a long time. Last time that happened was with Foster the People's album back in 2011. I can't explain to you how much TOP has changed my life in the last few months. I think about their music a lot and Tyler's song writing.   Bands blow up. It's what happens. I probably wouldn't of listened to TOP if Tear in my Heart wasn't on the iTunes chart. Tyler and Josh are humble guys. They won't lose their originality. You have nothing to fear by them blowing up. Some fans just like the music and that's okay.
twentyonepilots,3age00,Schmedly27,2,Sun Jun 21 09:08:38 2015 UTC,I thought it's been really cool seeing these guys that I believed in before they made it rise to the game they deserve. As much as some of the fans say cringe worthy things I have thoroughly enjoyed going on this ride with them and will continue to pursue them further throughout their careers (assuming they still write fantastic records)
twentyonepilots,3age00,popamollydrinksomeoj,2,Sat Jun 20 05:56:29 2015 UTC,"While i agree with you, and have noticed the same thing happening, it is good for a growing fan base because maybe one of those new fans will hear a song and delve into it, and maybe save themselves. |-/ stay sick as frick my fellow clique"
twentyonepilots,3agtda,ArminIsBae,2,Sat Jun 20 01:20:22 2015 UTC,"This version is in Regional at Best. I honestly don't like it at all. Love the song in Vessel, just hate how it's sung in this version."
twentyonepilots,3agtda,Cciamlazy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"The Vessel version is one of the only songs I know that can evoke actual tears from me; this version, though, just... man. It's too hollow-sounding and light, like Tyler didn't know what he was doing (in fairness, he didn't really). The mixing and recording of the drums are bad, the synth is too light and unfinished, and the constantly heavily-distorted vocals are too much."

twentyonepilots,3ae84o,CoastGuardSister,2,Fri Jun 19 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"It's really difficult to rank them, because there's a distinction between songs that I enjoy and songs that I think are better than others. For instance, Goner is an amazing song, but I don't listen to it very often (same with Truce)  P.S. It's nice to see Message Man at the top (haha) of your list, I feel like it's very underappreciated. There's so much detail put into it, I'm still discovering new things in that song."

twentyonepilots,3acpnx,antiweakz,11,Mon Jun 22 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think this song does its job on the record extremely well. Other than being a great tune, it serves two jobs in my opinion: introducing us to what we can expect from the album, and introducing us to the insecurity in Tyler's mind.   On first listen, anyone could tell you that this song goes through many transitions, it's a lot of genres all blended into one song. There's the fast rapping, techno sounding parts, and the melodic chorus of Tyler pleading for help.   The rest of the record encompasses many of these same features. Heavydirtysoul gives us a preview to what is to come when we listen to the rest. Ode to Sleep did something much similar for Vessel.   The song deals heavily with Tyler's inner voice, as do most songs on Blurryface, but the difference here is we're hearing it for the first time when we turn on the album. We don't know who Blurryface is yet, we just hear a guy rapping about some things inside his head and he's asking us to help save him from his uncertainties.   But I think that's the point. I think that's how Blurryface starts, in everyone. It starts as a nagging in our mind, something that says,""hey, no one else thinks of life the way I do. Does that mean I'm wrong?"" And that can spiral out of control until self doubt is consuming you and you end up with a Blurryface of your own.   Great song."
twentyonepilots,3acpnx,Tryforce17,9,Fri Jun 19 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, I love Tyler's admittance to having feelings and crying while still being a badass ""gangsters don't cry therefore I'm mr. Misty-eyed"".  Those ""mindless zombies"" are those who are so engrained in modern societies ways. Teens and young adults of today spend so much time focusing on the stupidest things and not what really matters. ""One time to twist and one time to shout"" seems to me to be an ode to the oldies song ""Twist and Shout"" possibly requesting modern youth to try to stop focusing on the stupid stuff, to put your mind to the future but for now enjoy the joyful moments.   Heavydirtysoul is such a good song; a perfect introduction to the album."
twentyonepilots,3acpnx,v_ronatron,5,Fri Jun 19 06:51:33 2015 UTC,"Love the lyrics, this is one of my favorites on a nearly flawless album. Tyler, and Blurryface by extension, are both so self aware in their lyrics, and that duality shows considering that despite having these nagging doubts and anxieties, he (they?) still have the courage to admit to them. What you get on this album is Tyler and Blurry at face value, and this song, pulling no punches, is an excellent introduction to the conflict.   Musically speaking, the composition ties in incredibly well to the themes of the song. The breakbeat during the rap section is pretty straight forward, but drops out so suddenly to a semi-distorted (dare I say ""blurry"") vocal bit which is a pronounced version of how dark thoughts manifest. I would attribute it to being how Tyler hears Blurry. The chorus comes in with just light piano notes and a beat, feeling both empty and scared, yet also hopeful, with the bass not coming in until the second half, accompanied by vocal harmony. For some reason, the chorus reminds me of AWOLnation.   The highlight, for me, is at the very end of the second chorus when the breakdown comes in. There's a pattern of 5 followed by 4. This is incredibly uncommon for the genre, and it's pulled off so subtly that it nearly isn't there if you're not purposefully looking for it... just like that voice in your head, the anxieties, the doubts, you know something is off, but you can't quite put your finger on what. It's ingenious, and it's not something that just ""happens by accident"". That's when I knew I was listening to something carefully crafted, the composition of the song itself carrying just as much weight and importance to the overall message as its lyrics. This was my ""oh damn"" moment.   The Blurry voice returns briefly before the chorus comes back in, but manages to be both haunted and ominous in that one bar. It gave me chills when I first heard it. Tyler's plea in the second half of the final chorus is layered over the breakdown, which for me conjures up imagery that he's getting sucked inward, having relinquished control of his own self to Blurry.   Overall, fantastically written, and one of the best opening tracks on an album I've heard in years. Sorry for the details are a bit overdrawn, I think I think a little too much. Any feedback?"
twentyonepilots,3acpnx,bmynameislexie,2,Fri Jun 19 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Not too much at all, actually, I really enjoyed it. I tend to 'feel' the music, rather than understand it, not having much experience making this sort and love the musical analysis.  I understand it on a much deeper level now, having listened to it while reading what you wrote, and the thing you said about the 5 then 4 pattern is so true, well done for spotting it."
twentyonepilots,3acpnx,candlesandfish,2,Sat Jun 20 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your feedback. My writing tends to allow me to understand my own thoughts better, so it's both surprising and really awesome that you got a deeper understanding of the song from my analysis. That makes me really happy. :)   I, too, tend to ""feel"" music, which is both a blessing and a curse. It's led to me liking a lot of great music with really bad lyrics. Haha. :P I love trying to pick up on not-so-obvious cues like the 5-4 pattern in the breakdown, and as a musician myself, I like throwing little bits like that in there, too.   Thanks again for checking out my analysis. I'm really glad you it gave you some insight."

twentyonepilots,3aay4g,micahjahns,5,Thu Jun 18 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"My brother and I were having a sort of abstract/philosophical conversation about twenty one pilots, and sort of came up with a theory or concept. I was thinking: Vessel sounds a lot brighter and ""open,"" and Blurryface sounds a lot darker and lonely. I know that there are happy sounding songs on BF, and dark sounding songs on Vessel, but I still noticed this main distiction between them when I compared their sounds. My brother then expanded on this by describing Vessel as ""a bright day spent outside with your friends"" and Blurryface as ""being alone, comfy in bed on a rainy and dark day.""   I thought these descriptions lined up pretty well, and a strange thought popped into my head: there is a sort of duality between the two albums, just like Tyler and Blurryface are a duality. Maybe Tyler wrote Vessel, and Blurryface wrote, well, Blurryface. Again, this is a sort of abstract and metaphorical theory, and there obviously are some potential holes in it, but I just thought I would throw it out there."
twentyonepilots,3aay4g,RiedInTheLead,2,Thu Jun 18 17:24:13 2015 UTC,And even the album covers depict this as well. Vessel is a nice bright cover whereas Blurryface is a darker cover.  I really like what you guys thought of.

Both the pictures clearly make up one picture that will be made up of four parts.   The first one tells about a date in 2013 in London captioned ""London has always been good to us"" (paraphrased)  The second is another in London (I think) but 2014, captioned ""and then we came back and the clique were waiting""  Now here's where the speculation happens. The next picture will be about the London show they did earlier this year, which is coincidentally, 2015.  The final picture, will be announcing an areana date in London, in 2016."

twentyonepilots,3a7tg6,thequiginator,4,Wed Jun 17 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"A guy that I've known basically my whole life just linked me to Holding Onto You (RaB) pretty much out of nowhere in May of 2012. He mentioned how they deserved a lot of attention and worked really hard at their stuff. I liked it but shrugged it off kind of at first. Later I went back and listened to it again because I couldn't stop thinking about the hook. I streamed it on YouTube and listened in my car on the way to class. I became addicted to the song and later twenty one pilots entirely.   Something about the way that I see Tyler and Josh's earlier almost punky sound and the person who showed me their music has always been impossible for me to explain. They remind me of a couple of guys I could have grown up with, gone to school with, rode bikes or jumped on trampolines with - only something about them feels out of reach, if that makes any sense.  They're those neighborhood kids that you see on your morning commute. They're the quiet-at-face but loud-in-mind cashier who is trying to find hope everyday as they check your groceries. They're the friends you lay on the couch with and talk about everything you're going to do when you grow up.  Well they're growing up, and it's always exciting to see what they're going to do next."
twentyonepilots,3a7tg6,Block_After_Block,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:08:03 2015 UTC,"Here is my boring story.   It was probably Spring 2014 (?)  I'm the kind of person who needs background noise when they go to sleep. Music really helps. So I put on MusicChoice and what do you know, Car Radio comes on. I fell in love with Tyler's majestic vocal chords immediately. So, of course I looked them up. The next song I listened to was Migraine. The title drew me in because I have migraines very often. I loved both of them and put them on my Music Favorites playlist.  But I sort of just forgot about it. I erased Car Radio off of my playlist because the lyrics felt a little too sad for me (at the time. look at me now lmao). But then, just recently, on April 27th 2015, Stressed Out came out. Little me was just scrolling down my Tumblr dashboard and then BAM. There it was in all it's glory. ""NEW twenty one pilots music video out! :D"". So I was like ""omg these are the guys who did that song"", so I listened to it and fell in love. Then I listened to Holding on to You. And Fairly Local. And Tear in My Heart. And Ode to Sleep. And basically all of their songs.  So I haven't been in the clique for a very long time, but I love them. I remember hearing them say ""stay alive"" for the very first time. It's like a weight was lifted off my shoulder. Something strange. But they helped me. Their music makes me happy.   (I'm sorry for the lil emo part at the end there. Thankx)"
twentyonepilots,3a7tg6,memeshay,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:16:11 2015 UTC,"It wasn't until I heard Car Radio that I was invested.  Holding On To You was significantly played on my favorite Alt Radio station like 2-2.5 years ago and my girlfriend and I HATED it. We would mock the way he said ""We are Surrounding.."" And the cheesy rapping. At this point I had no idea who TOP were nor did I know who sang that song.   Anyways it wasn't until I was on a music thread and Car Radio was number one. I really enjoyed listening to it and it was different. That's when I found TOP. And that's when I learned that they were the artists of ""Holding On To You""  To this day, they are my favorite band and I can't overplay any of their music. Including Holding On To You."

Also search youtube for interviews. Like I know that in a recent interview Tyler explains what blurryface represents. I don't remember which, though."
twentyonepilots,3a4l1w,seasickagain,2,Wed Jun 17 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"This is my personal favorite interview with them, especially the part where Tyler describes ""Kitchen Sink,"" which goes along with the meaning of the logo. These two interviews with Tyler are also up there. He's so deep and smart and I think it really shows with these: part 1 and part 2.  Edit: reason behind black paint, some info on the red and Blurryface album art.  Double edit: Genius is a great place to read and share interpretations of their songs. I know that Tyler and Josh have a reason behind everything, but they also want us to interpret it in a way that is important to us. They want us to think about it and find out what it means to us, and I think that is a very important thing to do. As a musician myself, I think something I've learned is that people who listen to your music aren't going to interpret a song the way that you had in mind, but it doesn't mean that they are wrong. Finding the meaning for yourself is just as important imo. Sorry for the long reply, I hope you understand where I'm coming from..."

The reason Tyler puts the black body paint on his neck and hands is because Tyler said in a interview that this is what he imagined what blurryface would look like. The masks are because when they were doing local shows and they wanted the people that came to watch them to remember them by. They wanted them to think even if they sucked, they would remember the masks. Hope this helped."

twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,StanzakJ1,15,Tue Jun 16 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"I totally noticed too, especially during the iHeart Radio album release concert back in May. I just assumed it's because he's nervous? These songs are still pretty fresh, and he's probably not quite used to performing them live yet in front of crowds, especially crowds this big. But whatever it is, I don't think it's on purpose."
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,seganr,3,Tue Jun 16 15:38:41 2015 UTC,Yeah. I've also noticed that he seems to get a lot more comfortable as the show progresses.
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,Jephenstones,5,Tue Jun 16 17:54:59 2015 UTC,Especially  when he starts singing songs from Vessel- he definitely seems more comfortable.
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,seganr,9,Tue Jun 16 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"His voice has made some changes over the years. I first saw them in 2013 and he sounded great and spoke and sang everything normally. Then the second time I saw them was the end of 2013 and (understandably) he could not sing as high or rap as hard so occasionally he would do a verse in his weird voice and omitted high notes in songs like Holding on to You and Guns for Hands. The last time I saw them was in mid 2014 and it was completely different. Everything was sung and spoken in an even more nasal sound. It sounds very intentional and bugs me. Very similar as to how he spoke to the crowd at iHeartRadio. But I watched some videos of Bunburry and Bonnaroo and it seems to be getting a lot better. So I guess he just needed to rest his voice then get back into the swing of things. Regardless when you're at a tøp show, you're blown away every second"
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,thefakemattk,3,Tue Jun 16 16:18:04 2015 UTC,I hear it on RAB and the self titled though. Like I think it's gotten better on recent albums.
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,bulletwords,6,Tue Jun 16 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot said here. His voice seems to improve as the shows go on and he also seems to be a bit uncomfortable with the new songs compared to vessel songs still. However, I think he's sounded his best vocally recently. The ""accent"" thing is often present in his speaking, but I think his singing has been great in 2015. I think it was awesome way back in 2011-2012, then took a dip, but I have been hearing him sounding great again. He sings more staccato and doesn't often hold out songs in live shows, but I don't think that's because he is losing ability, I think it's because he's focusing on making the live show energetic and fun, and saves vocal meticulousness for the studio.   TL;DR - The show is less about vocal impressiveness and more about energy and catharsis, and Tyler's voice is still thriving yet."
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,Block_After_Block,7,Tue Jun 16 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a change in the way he sings over the past few years. Back in their earlier days he was always incredibly energetic and loud with his singing, rapping more like he does in the recordings. Now that they play much more often I think he's toned it back a little bit. It could be a way for him to avoid doing damage to his vocal chords, his own voice maturing past his younger range, or just a stylistic choice. I still love them, but I think that the Tyler we saw back then isn't coming back."
twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,KayRizzle,3,Tue Jun 16 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"It's actually way worse for your vocal chords to not use your full voice, though. It might be because he likes the style, but hasn't had voice lessons maybe"

twentyonepilots,3a1o7b,micahjahns,2,Tue Jun 16 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"His voice sounded different comparing the 2013 concert and 2014 concert I went to. To me it sounded like he was more confident. When singing, he might have to alter his voice a bit to hit all the notes and such. Either way, I don't mind and I think he sounds just fine."

twentyonepilots,3a42xp,rosefire16,3,Wed Jun 17 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's confusingly classified. Here's my interpretation of it: it is a 7"" record in that the playable music on it takes about as much circumference as a normal 7"" 45RPM vinyl single would. It has only 3 songs on it.   However, to get the Ohio shape around the playable 7"" of grooves, the record itself had to be a little bigger. Corner to corner I think it's probably close to 10"", another common format for 5(ish) song EPs. Some may classify it even up to 12"" just cause when it sits on a player, the Northwest corner of Ohio sticks off the mat a little.  There was only one pressing of it (5000 total I think?), all are the same so far. If you need it I can post a picture tomorrow of everything I just mentioned."

I now have their entire discography in physical CDs :)  I definitely prefer Good News to We Were Dead; it's actually one of their better albums, in my opinion. It keeps the rough edges and bizarre tendencies of their previous work while also smoothing out the production with a lot more pop sounds.  We Were Dead was a bit too smooth around the edges for me, though I still enjoy it, just not as much as other MM albums."

twentyonepilots,39xnx7,robertbrysonhall,3,Mon Jun 15 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"They go out after a show as much as possible. Usually you're waiting around an hour. Also, very slim chance that you won't meet them if you wait, even if you gotta do a group of who you came with, or just a picture, or just an autograph - they try to get everyone in!  I've never met them even though I've tried a few times, as I either couldn't stay or was told they weren't coming out due to weather (and then did anyway because a small group stayed and the gods answered their prayers! Lucky ducks!)."
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,ThisisGabeB,2,Mon Jun 15 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, I'm going by myself so I guess I can stay as long as possible, I'll probably be the last one to leave then if there are others waiting outside with me"
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,likeastreet,3,Mon Jun 15 18:59:57 2015 UTC,I didn't get to meet them once. I understood though. I believe Tyler was sick and Josh was going through a breakup so he wasn't feeling it. I totally understand
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,likeastreet,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:35 2015 UTC,When I met Josh we probably had to wait two hours and Tyler was too tired to come out.

It was amazing to get to meet him, I was just sharing to let everyone know that a lot of times only one of them comes out but you can usually meet one if you wait long enough. (I think it could start getting more difficult since they've gotten more popular though)"
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,revengeanditsthrills,2,Wed Jun 17 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to see them for the first time on my own in San Diego later in October. I was wondering what are the chances of meeting them after a show as well. It would be such an amazing experience, so I wish us all luck."
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,revengeanditsthrills,2,Tue Jun 16 07:21:43 2015 UTC,Last April in Boston I waited for about an hour and a half then had to go to make the last train back to home. Later found out that only Josh came out and it was a group photo situation like what people have been describing. Apparently the cold was too much for Tyler's delicate vocal cords lol. But I know they try their best and care deeply about the fanbase.
twentyonepilots,39xnx7,entertain-my-faith,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"I waited for about 3 hours with a group of people in Melbourne and they had run out the other door to avoid us. Was disappointing considering all of the great stories people have about meeting them, and none of the crew told us they'd left either, so we were waiting for a long time before it got too late/cold."

He looked pretty angry in the wings and didn't come out for the last song. Looking at the way they've been interacting with fans recently, I do think that my night was just a one off."

twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,noided_,7,Tue Jun 16 07:19:22 2015 UTC,"Try giving them another listen. The more you listen, the more you hear new layers of the songs. They are quite deep and have well thought out meanings.    If it's still not clicking then perhaps it's just not your cup of tea."
twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,revatron,3,Tue Jun 16 10:32:57 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the songs are filled with metaphors.  Kitchen Sink is not literally about a kitchen sink; it's about knowing your worth, facing your inner demons, and being true to yourself.  Migraine is not literally about a bad headache; it's about staying strong and staying alive no matter what is happening inside your head.  Just scratching the surface of twenty one pilots does not do them a justice."
twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,Bingbongday,3,Tue Jun 16 17:58:54 2015 UTC,It took me a good 3 or 4 listens to really appreciate them. I used to not understand how anyone could like them either and now they're one of my favorite bands.
twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,MusicNerds,3,Tue Jun 16 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"Generic Pop with Generic Lyrics?  That's like saying water is dry, and air makes it hard to breathe.   I can certainly understand saying they didn't strike a chord with you, or not particularly liking their style...  Many people don't, especially not at first blush.  But there is nothing generic about this band, and as one of the older posters here at this reddit, I've been listening to music for a LONG time, so I feel qualified to make such an assertion!"
twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,The_DILinator,3,Wed Jun 17 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know what songs or lyrics you like so that maybe I could suggest some songs that might change your mind? :)   I don't think that you need to know why people like a certain type of music because in the end, people have their own reasons which can range from liking how it sounds to feeling deeply connected to the lyrics. Sometimes certain lyrics won't click with everyone, but to somebody else it might mean a lot. So I don't think I could properly answer your question because my point of view seems to be almost the opposite of yours from what I can tell haha. All I can say is listen to what you connect with and enjoy that, listen to the twenty one pilots songs that you like and avoid the ones you don't. :-)"
twentyonepilots,3a0ikc,PrincessPorcupine5,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:51:06 2015 UTC,I think one of the things that hook me to twenty one pilots is that I can really relate to some of the issues that their songs address.

""This seems to indicate a lack of faith in the organized religious system and the figures who teach and represent it and Tyler’s or Blurryface’s desire to gnaw at the heels of those who operate within it while clawing away at the greater system at large as to escape its hold."""
twentyonepilots,39tlvw,Chriswick4,3,Mon Jun 15 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"To me it means that catholicism in general is getting slowly whittled down (the gnawing) and is losing its meaning due to oversimplification and lack of real connection to the faith by organized religion, which is represented by the bishops. There's also a line ""repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted"" in the song that indicates that he thinks organized religion is taking away from the deeper, more personal aspects of religion. It's a way of thinking that I often saw expressed by teachers and peers in my catholic school when I was younger- it's becoming less about the religion and faith and spirituality, and more about following a set of standards and rules to be a ""proper"" follower of the church and in mass."

With Goner I see a lot of dark gray, black, and other shades of gray (not 50, maybe 30) and splatters of bright red and sometimes dark blue.  The colors actually correlate with the TOP colors of black red blue and white, which I find funny. But I get much more of a kaleidoscope view of my colors, not sure how OP interprets them."
twentyonepilots,39qgbr,goodnight-everybody,3,Sun Jun 14 08:00:04 2015 UTC,my colors are almost exactly the same!
twentyonepilots,39qgbr,jze53714,2,Mon Jun 15 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"thats so awesome, thank you!"
twentyonepilots,39qgbr,Skizzzzy,6,Sun Jun 14 14:50:39 2015 UTC,When you see colors do they tend to be the same ones for certain moods in songs or is it pretty random?
twentyonepilots,39qgbr,alrebmik,5,Sat Jun 13 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"it depends! like slower twenty one pilots songs typically have similar colors but a slow top song might be really different colors than a slow song of another band, if that makes sense!"
twentyonepilots,39qgbr,memeshay,2,Sat Jun 13 23:24:26 2015 UTC,that's rad. interesting that hometown's colors are relatively light.

twentyonepilots,39rmf3,ArminIsBae,7,Sun Jun 14 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"This is great news. I hope he truly means it. Even if he didn't, simply acknowledging that his words hurt people is fantastic. Good for him.   There will always be crazy people, no matter what they believe. Death threats are never okay!"
twentyonepilots,39rmf3,meagan51422,3,Sun Jun 14 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wall  The attitude these folks have in calling people who make mistakes on TWITTER ""transphobic trash"" & all that are so frustrating.  Thransgender people have had the least legitimate exposure out of the whole LGBTQ crew. The tumblr community (and therefore the social media they frequent) have focused on social justice so intensely that they have already normalized transgender people. They see someone ""from the real world"" use the wrong pronoun and they take a way too aggressive approach, bc it's a basic rule that they learned a while ago.  I honestly think that the ones going overboard have no capacity to realize that these newly mainstream things take time to be absorbed by folks. It's not some switch to be flipped.  /rant  I'm glad zack apologized but his favs weren't even transphobic. The hoes one was very obviously a joke and the one about the espn award is an opinion. If any of those very deserving people had one, there would have been fallout anyway bc people see it as ""oh they think ______ requires less bravery than _______.""   If he had faved drakes ""sorry,still calling u bruce"" tw or something about men not being able to flirt without doubting their original gender, it would've been legitimately transphobic. These kids are throwing that word around so much, it's gonna lose it's weight"
twentyonepilots,39rmf3,wutwot,4,Tue Jun 16 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"He favorites a picture that says ""Fuck Bruce Jenner... NIGGAS turn into HOES everyday""  Is it just me or is that blatantly a joke? I assume thats something he favorite'd because it was funny...its says ""NIGGA"" and ""HOES"" in all caps. There's no way that is a serious post. Some people are so annoying. I've just glanced at the entire situation - I don't know at all the details - but this is ridiculous. He shouldn't be getting any kinds of hate from what I've seen.  Some of the people on the internet really make me want to inflict pain onto myself. This whole generation of these hyper-sensitive tumblr kids infuriates me.  Someone tweeted to Zack, ""cis people don't get to decide what is and isn't transphobic""  So just because he hasn't changed his gender does mean he can have an opinion on what he believes is and isn't offensive? This is terrible logic.  I probably have no idea what I'm talking about because, like I said, I've only glanced at the situation, so maybe he is in the wrong. But, from what I've seen, this is just stupid.  Just looking at his tweets, I don't see him saying anything offensive. He's getting called out for favoriting a picture??????????"

This is terrible logic.   He can have an opinion, sure, but because he isn't a member of the group that's being affected, that opinion is irrelevant in this context. Saying ""Well, I wasn't trying to be offensive"" doesn't matter, because people were offended."
twentyonepilots,39rmf3,WhovianJackson,4,Sun Jun 14 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but these people were offended by him favoriting a picture. Favoriting a picture, that's what his opinion was?  He thought that Lauren Hill should've received the award over Bruce Jenner. If the people who decided who received the award have never been trans like Jenner, or never have had an inoperable brain tumor like Hill, how are they qualified to make this decision?"

I believe that your age don't define who you are, and maybe some of these teenagers really appreciate top's music. But you're right anyway,  lots of people really don't try to understand the lyrics or they simply listen to top because it's ""cool"" or whatever. But I think that they (top) won't change their style neither their deep lyrics and all the things that we like, because that's the music they want to create and they're not going to change it just because some teenage girls (or whoever) don't like it. Hope I helped you in some way, and stay alive, friend! |-/"
twentyonepilots,39m6ex,Zephyro7h,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"Well, my intention never was to ofend anybody and in case I did I'm sorry. I just wanted to point that well, if the person who posted this is worried about seeing the band change or seeing  people not giving enought relevance to the song meaning, it's because this happens all the time, of course it even happens with me (the part of not giving enough importance to the lyrics of se songs, I'm not a band haha) so that's it, I don't really care too much about the reason that leads someone to listen to some type of music, if they're happy with listening to it I'm happy too, and it's always good to see that people get interested in top and their music. Hope that this explains my vision a bit better :)"
twentyonepilots,39m6ex,Zephyro7h,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"No, no! As I said, ""you"" didn't mean you. It was just a response in this dicussion."

I'll be 28 soon and I know that's not old but when I see a group of teenagers in the crowd freaking out of the same band...it does make me feel a bit old and out of my element. I had a weird breakdown when I realized that these guys are a year younger then me.   When I think about when I was a teenager, my band that got me through everything was Linkin Park (up to ""Minutes to Midnight""). I'm NOT at all comparing TØP to LP but there is always that band when you're going through all the complications of becoming an young adult. These teenagers are just lucky enough to have TØP to be that band."

twentyonepilots,399fl5,cocojackson,4,Wed Jun 10 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"NPI is tylers old work. I would assume its something special to him, and redoing it would probably not feel the same. Additionally, its separate from TOP, and deffinitly not the direction top has been heading. If anything I would like to see Tyler's older music in the highest quality files he saved at the time. I doubt he was exporting his projects at 192 kbps, so those files are deffinitlly out there somewhere.  Anyway, as much as I like the NPI era songs, I think Tyler and joshes time will be best spent perfecting the live performance of blurryface, and eventually creating the next album."

twentyonepilots,396fo6,staticfire96,5,Mon Jun 15 08:10:36 2015 UTC,"Basically just delete anything that gets posted more than 2 times within the month, but that's my opinion.   So for example, ""any good artists like TØP?""  Three days later: ""I was wondering are there any bands comparable to TØP, any suggestions? "" the latter should be deleted with a link to the same question so they get their answer"
twentyonepilots,396fo6,staticfire96,6,Tue Jun 9 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"While I agree this is ideal, it's really difficult pragmatically. There are five mods (not counting our Robot Overlordpraise be unto him) and we aren't all on reddit at the same time. And even just for myself, I know I have a good memory of things I've seen but a terrible memory of whether I saw something 2 days or 4 weeks ago."

twentyonepilots,396fo6,whimsynixie,3,Tue Jun 9 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"For my two cents:   I think these are worthwhile because its exploratory and no thread will be the same, however I do think it clutters up the subreddit. My suggestion would be to have a link to an on going list in the sidebar, and then direct all posts to each Monday thread. This way we still hear all the opinions as they're changing, but not adding too many threads. I think the easiest way to actually fix this is to have a buying/selling subreddit for TØP. No matter how many times we suggest to 'look for similar posts' or something along those lines they'll still pop up. A sub dedicated to buying and selling tickets would still be active during tours and may be useful. I'm not too sure. I can see why removing would be nice, but I don't have a great solution for this either. Maybe if there was a FAQ that includes a general answer to this, plus some explanation of what other TØP lingo is? Personally I really love these threads. I find that there're often different and every time I visit those I get something else out of reading and upvoting responses. I'd encourage more creative thread posting however. Another sub I subscribe to has almost daily the same iteration of the same question, but it changes by a word or two to change emphasis and somehow that still keeps it fresh."
twentyonepilots,396fo6,not_todayy,3,Tue Jun 9 18:00:32 2015 UTC,I dig the concept of a TØP Buy/Sell.. Sub..subreddit? baha. It would be nice though to direct that stuff there. But we'll probably never avoid having people posting stuff like that anyways.. But it would make it more accessible? Also a TØP lingo  FAQ would be adorable.

twentyonepilots,396fo6,hannahbear94,2,Tue Jun 9 21:29:10 2015 UTC,I feel like post pertsining to the four things you mentioned should probably be removed. The sub does get rather cluttered or repetative at times from people posting on the same topic.

I think people should only post if they are selling or giving away tickets, not asking for them.  But I do think those should be allowed.  If someone gets to go to TOP concert when they wouldn't have otherwise the extra clutter  WILL be worth it.  Music Mondays only for new music, please.  No asking about new ticket info but post about new ticket info.  This sub should be more proactive than interrogative I think whenever possible."

I feel like when people create something they want to get it out there right away, and if it's like Friday or something and they post it to the creations thread from Wednesday, it can get kind of buried, especially when looking at the newest posts.

I had never listened to them (obviously) but just agreed to review a gig of theirs, just because I had heard nothing but amazing things about them from people who's musical opinions I really trust. I was in the car being driven to my day job at the time when I hit play on the song, expecting to be blown away by awesomeness. I fucking ~hated~ it. Like... I thought it was terrible. God awful.

Instantly got hooked with House of Gold. Seeing Josh's drumming, Tyler's mannerisms and the song itself really made me think these guys were something special. I immediately downloaded a few songs by them thinking they were a primarily ukulele and singing based group. Boy was I wrong haha. Took me a while to warm up to the rapping and electronic sounds on tracks like ode to sleep and semi-automatic."

twentyonepilots,394bj9,Saintkitts,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"容器. That's Japanese (or Chinese too, I suppose, I only ever studied Japanese though) for ""Vessel"".   Also in case anyone is curious, this shirt (along with having Vessel again) is ""power to the local dreamer"" Google translated into Japanese. 地元の夢想家への電力. Not really accurate, one of the problems being the use of ""electric power"" which I'm sure isn't what's really meant."

Josh did a backflip during Holding on to You, and they used ski masks during Car Radio and some other ones I don't remember everything. Yes, it starts with them coming from the back of the stage.

No shame but during the Lane Boy build-up when we all crouched down, I'm tall anyways and I tried to crouch a tiny bit higher so I could try to be able to see myself in the video. Honestly, I can't wait to be able to see them again. They have some of the best energy I've seen at a show."

Robert Delong also does rap style singing with the same type of instrumentals. Twenty one pilots is a one of a kind band and theres nothing truly similar, which is why they're so special. HOWEVER, Jon Bellion. He's been around awhile as a writer/producer, but in the recent year is emerging (hes been around but this has been a breakthrough year with the definition mixtape) as a prominent artist. He blends rapping and singing just like TOP, has some songs that are strictly singing, and has similar lyrical style. I'd check him out, I'd recommend Jungle or Luxury, but his entire Definition Mixtape is fire."

Dealing with depression, especially one I feel is fueled in part by attacks from the enemy, part of me just wants to wave a white flag and surrender so I can be left alone and get some peace.   This might be getting too personal, but I've always wanted to do a lot of big, good things to help God's kingdom. I felt like I was on the road to doing those things, until a I fell on a lot of really hard times. Now I just want to be left alone and be happy again, for the first time in years.  ""Please tell 'em, you'll have no plans for me"" really resonates with me because lately I really want God to have no big plan for me that causes the enemy to want to attack me.

It's so easy to want an easy life when we're already struggling with stuff. In the end I just have to keep saying ""I'll stay awake, because the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.""   It's encouraging to know that ultimately God wins over the dark and the enemy has no power except where God allows it. Even when it's hard to believe that, I try to remember that it's true.

twentyonepilots,38uqa3,buttercupisevil2,9,Sun Jun 7 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"Stressed Out from the new album. Within the past year I have been dealing with actual adult stuff for the first time, and I recently turned 20 and have been feeling weird about it. Internally I really don't feel like an adult at all even when I have to act like one, yet the childish excitement of life is still diminishing. It's kinda bleh.  Also, I've spent most of my life caring what people think of me, which caused me to become a pretty reserved and quiet person with some mild social anxiety. I kinda had this ""if I stand still they won't notice me"" mentality. I'm crazy and hyper and funny around my close friends, but around anyone else I struggle to find literally anything to keep a conversation going without saying anything that will make them judge me somehow. And it's exactly that struggle to find something to say that makes me seem boring and awkward, which isolates me even MORE."

twentyonepilots,38uqa3,hashtagsmoreos,4,Sun Jun 7 00:47:37 2015 UTC,"I really felt a strong connection to Migraine and Kitchen Sink.  Kitchen Sink beacuse I'm always hot and cold when I get upset / depressed. I always want people to leave me alone, but at the same time, I want to be comforted and loved and be told everything's going to be okay. Which is exactly how the song goes. And it just talks about finding purpose within yourself, and how cliche other people can be. It's just the most relatable TOP song I know, honestly.  And I relate to Migraine because I struggled with some severe depression/eating disorder problems a couple years back, and this just sums up completely how I felt and how I still feel sometimes. Especially the line about the island behind his eyes."
twentyonepilots,38uqa3,YourSweetSummerChild,3,Sun Jun 7 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"A Car, a Torch, a Death. I'm pretty sure I'm interpreting the song completely wrong, but when I first heard it some stuff was going on in my life that tore me up, and the lyrics seemed to fit what happened, so that has been the lyrics meanings to me since then, and I can't get past it. So I don't know what the song is really about, but in my interpretation, I really feel it.  Also, Car Radio. There was a time that my car couldn't play music, and being left alone with my thoughts led to some dark thoughts I'd rather not revisit."

twentyonepilots,38uqa3,GregorSD,3,Sun Jun 7 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like I connect with Blurryface lyrics in general a lot better than previous albums, since it's not happy, but it's a bit lighter than the depressing stuff present in their earlier works. This is one of the things that makes it better than Vessel to me.  Probably Ride. Very simple: I just feel like I overthink things a lot and stress out over completely insignificant, small issues, and that bridge part (though it's the simplest part of the song) speaks to me. I remember when Ride first dropped, I was feeling kind of stressed about a lot of stuff, and I fell asleep while listening to it on a loop, and I felt significantly better when I awoke.  I've never dealt with any real depression like some people on this sub, so I connect with the more common issues and insecurities that they discuss."

The first verse is my depression telling me how worthless I really am and how I'm not going anywhere with my life. That's my Blurryface. The second verse's total reverse in lyrics and meaning is when I climb back out of the hole and escape him. Changes that stick out to me are ""What I want to save I will kill"" to ""What I want to save I will try"" and ""And repeat yesterday's dance"" to ""To avoid yesterday's dance""  The lines, ""Yo, you bulletproof in black like a funeral / The world around us is burning, but we're so cold"" reminds me of how emotionally distant I can get sometimes, even when I'm not in a bad depressive episode. Sometimes I just feel jaded, but it isn't because I don't care. It's because I don't want to deal with my own emotions. ""The few, the proud, and the emotional""  The chorus is a reminder to me and others who share in this feeling that, well, there are others who share this feeling. Depression can be extremely lonely, but it's a relief to hear that someone else has ""Seen the streets / You're walking down"" :)"

It's difficult to choose, but Taxi Cab means a lot to me.   For me the song is a cry out to God: ""I want to crawl inside your ghost and fill up every hole inside my mind."" It assures me that regardless of my circumstances, whether it's dying or flying away, he will be with me. Even when I don't feel like he's there, he tells me not to be afraid because ultimately I'm on my way home to him.   And that journey home is detailed in the rap, which reminds me of how helpless I am in my own salvation, that it's God who is saving me and driving me ""towards the morning sun"". The imagery is just really beautiful - Tyler said in a video that it's one of his favourite verses that he's written and I can really see why.   Don't be afraid, you're going home.

Same goes for being a sexist, homophobic, or transphobic. Staying silent about peoples prejudices only fosters more hate. Intolerance shouldn't be ignored. You speak up because sometimes speaking up is the only thing you can do.   Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but why is it that people will rush to defend people who are homophobic or transphobic for stating their opinion but don't do the same for bullies who say equally hateful words? A bully might be saying an opinion but you don't write it off just because they are entitled to one. You draw the line when the message you are sending is one of hate and malice. Your words should never cause someone to stay awake at night contemplating whether or not to stay alive. Words are a powerful tool in keeping someone alive, as we know from this music, but an even more powerful tool at taking it away. A bully is a bully, and a bully should always be called out. I don't care who the bully is.  Let people think what they want to think because that is their right but that doesn't mean it's okay to hurt people by saying it."

twentyonepilots,38tity,AnaBeingBored,4,Sat Jun 6 18:27:54 2015 UTC,I could probably write a thesis on why I think Vessel is a musical masterpiece that could have only been crafted by the hands of God. Two years later and there's still layers to the lyrics and musicianship that I don't yet understand. Literally a perfect album in my view and where I think anyone should start.
twentyonepilots,38tity,YourSweetSummerChild,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:15:18 2015 UTC,"I still don't get why people like Vessel. I mean, it's not a bad album, but it's certainly their weakest-- especially when you consider that not only was it a ten track album, four of its songs were from the Regional at Best.  I guess if you hadn't heard RoB you might like Vessel more-- but I had. For me, Vessel was an EP. A good one, mind you, but not as good as any of their albums before or since."
twentyonepilots,38tity,21stPilot,2,Mon Jun 8 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"This is gonna ba long one but if you dont mind reading through I'd love to hear your thoughts  You've got a fair reason for thinking it's one of their weakest having heard the 4 from RaB. Vessel though was their first stuff I ever heard so I had no qualms from that. That being said, I dont think the inclusion of previous songs should really be a demerit when discussing how good or bad the album is. Granted, I would've been disappointed if I'd been expecting all new songs but having been three years now I think it's fair to sit back and evaluate the album without taking that into consideration.   Looking at Vessel on its own, I think it's the most layered yet accessible work of music I've ever heard. Three years later and there are still verses that I don't quite fully understand. The lyrics in particular are amazing. I love Fall Away, Taxi Cab, Addict With a Pen, and Pantaloon off of the self-titled album; individually each of these have some of the tightest, most thought-through lyrics I've ever heard. Yet, all of the songs on Vessel (except maybe the Run and Go, and Screen would be here for me if not for that one amazing verse with the train in the sky) stand up to these and then some (Migraine and Ode to Sleep in particular). But I think the greater accomplishment is creating an entire album that can be listened to as a single piece of music. Sure, the songs are definitely distinct from one another, but the way they're organized and reference each other feels symphonic in a way. Imagine it was the first time you were listening to the album, Ode to Sleep is the first thing you hear and if you're not going ""What the fuck is going on in this"" your mental capacity is beyond me. It takes an entire listen-through (or ten) to really start to unravel the meaning of the songs. They blend together and reinforce the same message over and over again, yet each song does it from a completely different angle.   But moving on from the lyrics and the meaning behind the songs, I think the music is simply incredible and beyond what they had done previously. Ode to Sleep and Semi-Automatic are each like 4 different songs in one that somehow work. Car Radio would be the most powerful song in any other band's arsenal, but in their case it's not even the most powerful on this album. That spot belongs to Trees (and thanks to Blurryface for reintroducing us to Goner). Ode to Sleep, Fake You Out, and in particular Migraine are some of the most intricate songs I've ever heard. Tyler's rapping is at an all-time high point on Migraine and Josh's drumming is simply incredible. I do think Josh's work on this album is also far and away the best he's ever done as well.   So yeah, that's a primer for you. Sorry about the length lol. Again though, I'd love to hear what anyone has to say about it too"
twentyonepilots,38tity,YourSweetSummerChild,2,Sat Jun 13 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah-- I'd like to be able to analyze the album like that, but I'm so tainted I can't do so with any measure of objectivity.   Before Vessel, I had listened to Regional At Best so many times that by the time Vessel came around, I couldn't see it as anything else but a sort of professional, single artist mixtape.  I love Truce and its position on the album, and the rest of the new songs are great-- but they feel weakened, interspersed with the already RaB songs. Don't get me wrong, the RaB songs are also fantastic-- but it's like trying to take meaning from a book where half the chapters are from another book you've already read.   I cannot see the RaB songs as part of Vessel-- because they are from RaB, not Vessel."
twentyonepilots,38tity,21stPilot,2,Sat Jun 13 13:24:19 2015 UTC,"That's totally legit. Going back to RaB after Vessel I will say that for the most part I like the reworked versions of the old songs better on vessel than on RaB, if only because I'm really glad Tyler dropped the autotune. That killed Trees free for me. But otherwise sure. I've actually started making some playlists where I mix up songs from all of their albums and it's crazy how different you can take some of the songs depending on their context. Some of the songs on Blurryface for example would fit in perfect on Vessel"
twentyonepilots,38tity,YourSweetSummerChild,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"Dude. I just realized Vessel's version of Trees is missing from my library.   I gotta figure out where that went! My copy's legit-- maybe my library saw it as a duplicate and removed it. I'm not sure.  I'm of a similar opinion. Originally, I disliked RaB Trees, due to the autotune. I eventually came around and liked it anyways. Its weird sound became a part of its identity.   Though I will say, listening to them side by side, Vessel's version is certainly better."
twentyonepilots,38tity,21stPilot,2,Sat Jun 13 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha if you cant find it, I have mine that I can send you.   Which is your preference between RaB and the Self-Titled? I'm actually pretty recently getting into their older catalogue and am still divided on this"
twentyonepilots,38tity,YourSweetSummerChild,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's fine, I can download it off iTunes again.  They're both good albums with a different feel-- again, I'm biased, as RaB was the first album of theirs I listened to. It was about a few weeks after that when I purchased TOP.  Lyrically speaking, TOP definitely has some of the darkest, strangest themes, and its simpler feel adds to its authentic spark.   It was a good place to start, and the band has only gotten better. Each album has quite a different sound-- that makes the original sound, not old and immature, but as different and wonderful as any other TOP album. Dare I say it?-- that's lovely.  Addict With a Pen; Trapdoor; Oh Ms Believer; A Car, A Torch, A Death-- all these are some of my favorite song-- some of my favorite songs, not just some of my favorite Twenty One Pilots songs."
twentyonepilots,38tity,21stPilot,4,Sat Jun 13 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing to do if becoming a new TOP fan is to work your way backwards. The music becomes less ""accessible"" as you move back, however, the more you begin to understand the band, those earlier songs become gems that are in their own right among the best music TOP has to offer. You'll get to self-titled, but start with Vessel."
twentyonepilots,38tity,bulletwords,3,Sun Jun 7 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"Stand out tracks on Vessel (for me at least) would be Ode to Sleep, Car Radio, Holding On to You, Migraine, Guns for Hands and Trees. Tracks that are my special favorites on Vessel include The Run and Go and Semi-Automatic"

twentyonepilots,38sn85,ConvolutedBoy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:08:52 2015 UTC,This is a really important topic and the OP of that thread said he probably should not have deleted it. LGBT+ members of the clique have the highest rate of suicide and need the most support from us and twenty one pilots to stay alive. Zack is featured in kitchen sink and in the stressed out music video and if we just sit by and say nothing then we are defeating the whole point of the clique. Individuals harmed by Zack need to see that he doesn't represent Tyler's views and that his hate speech is overwhelmingly condemned by the clique. We need to all support each other.

During the summer last year he made a good recovery and everything is fine today. But during that time I remember listening to this song and thinking of him.

twentyonepilots,38jga6,face-_-it,2,Fri Jun 5 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"idk what I can put together with this but there a quite a few refrences to Zack in their music  Slowtown:   I remember when my brother and other kids from neighboring houses would get together.  I would ride my bike and my brother would ride his.  Put cards in our spokes and make our engine sound like traffic;  when using Pokemon cards, please do not use the holographics!   Kitchen Sink:   So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy,  who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time.  Here's my brother, in his head, screwed up, but that's alright.  [then, of course, Zack's rap verse]   Stressed Out:   I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it;  try to sell it- never sell out of it.  I'd probably only sell one.  I'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose  Same clothes...  Homegrown...  A stone's throw from a creek we used to roam  But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered  Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter.

twentyonepilots,38icet,AllOfTheDerp,23,Thu Jun 4 12:19:14 2015 UTC,"This song, especially in the chorus and the bridge, seems to deal with both Tyler's doubt in himself and in God. in the first verse, Tyler explains how he is scared of himself and what's inside of him, namely Blurryface, who personifies low self-confidence (""scared of my own image""), lack of mental/emotional/moral maturity, etc.  The chorus appears to be Tyler speaking towards God, asking him to remain faithful even though Tyler constantly doubts him. I feel like Tyler's doubt in himself and in God are connected, like an increase in one of them results in an increase in the other. This would make sense, because Tyler finds all of his self-worth in God (""I'm no good without you"".) I've seen some people interpret the chorus as Tyler talking to Blurryface or vice versa, but that doesn't seem to fit as well as the religious interpretation.  In the second verse, the phrase ""temperature is dropping"" is a metaphorical representation of Tyler's doubts growing and his trust in God dropping. I say this because Tyler references his own soul as ""freezing"" in The Judge. Tyler also declares that doesn't know if he ""can see this ever stopping,"" meaning that as his faith wanes, he loses even more confidence in his ability to trust in God. ""Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,"" conveys the idea of Tyler giving into his doubts and flaws in his thinking. The ""no"" at the end could be Tyler's somewhat feeble attempt to rebel against his unbelief.   The bridge exemplifies and expresses Tyler's critical thoughts and problems he has with parts of modern religion/Christianity. ""Gnawing on the bishops, claw away at the system"" is him opposing the Church and the way it works. Perhaps he is displeased by leaders in the church, such as bishops, abusing their authority or exploiting people in the congregation. Hypocrisy and self-righteousness is a dangerous problem in many churches. In addition, he casts a negative light on ""repeating simple phrases"" just because ""someone holy insisted."" There are many short phrases repeating during church and a Christian's life (which isn't necessarily a negative thing), but eventually this can become mindless repetition that loses meaning. For instance, when someone asks God for forgiveness every Sunday, eventually they tend to just ""go through the motions"" instead of putting their heart and soul into it. Tyler also is highlighting the importance of thinking for oneself. He doesn't want people to do something just because their elder or society tells them to (this isn't to say that it's bad to be influenced by them), he wants people to think for themselves and act on their own passions and beliefs without blindly following. The ""markings made on [his] skin"" refer to the many religious tattoos he has acquired over the years. When someone first gets a tattoo, it's a huge deal and bears a lot of significance. As time goes on, the importance and pride in that marking diminishes, either because people regret making the decision to get the tattoo, or simply because it gets placed in the back of their mind. Tyler seems to be inferring the latter. He truly wants to restore the significance he once placed in his tattoos. He wants to stop taking God for granted and truly make an effort every day to recognize the significance of his faith. The fact that he hopes that God ""hasn't left without him"" shows that he does care about his faith (at least part of him does), and he knows that he has to depend on God to save him from unbelief. Tyler is reminding God of his promise to never leave him or forsake him. (Deuteronomy 31:6)  A whole lot more can be said about this song, and I've spent a lot of time thinking if the meaning, as it's one of my favorites. There are other possible interpretation, but I feel as if this is the general idea of what Tyler is trying to express."

twentyonepilots,38icet,ASovietSpy,5,Thu Jun 4 16:47:06 2015 UTC,I probably spend way too much time writing these things out... But I enjoy it :)
twentyonepilots,38icet,micahjahns,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"I know I'm two weeks late, but I've only recently discovered the sub and am still finding things.  I like your analysis, the only thing I'd suggest is maybe with the 'repeating simple phrases someone holy insisted' is an attempt to get through the crazy in his head and his doubt - sometimes 'God have mercy, have mercy' and similar things are all you can manage, but it's still worth doing. ""Arrow prayers"" can be used in times of desperation, and I see the 'simple phrases' as things like Lord have mercy, or God help me."
twentyonepilots,38icet,candlesandfish,2,Sat Jun 20 04:25:39 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of it that way, but I really like that interpretation!"
twentyonepilots,38icet,micahjahns,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with u/micahjahns' interpretation, which is far clearer than I could have put it, but I do have some other thoughts/questions.   The line ""scared of my own ceiling"" make me think of lying in bed unable to sleep, and becoming afraid of even the familiar things around you. At the same time, it could also be interpreted as being scared of your own limits in life, whether you place them upon yourself or they're placed upon you. I thought that dual meaning was interesting.   The line ""fear leads to anxiety"" makes me think about the distinction between fear and anxiety. I'm not exactly sure what that is, and so on the surface it seems like a bit of a pointless statement. The more I think about it, though, I feel like anxiety is a more prolonged, settled thing, whilst fear is the initial reaction. I'm not sure. Thoughts, anyone?   I'm wondering how the third verse about clawing away at the system fits into the song as a whole. Is he saying that such a system of hypocrisy/mindless religion is responsible for the doubt?   Overall it's an incredibly honest song about how he's feeling about his relationship with God, and one that I can definitely appreciate and relate to.   Also this has been pointed out before, but I like how the line in The Judge, ""I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt"" feeds straight into this song."
twentyonepilots,38icet,KyasakoKana,2,Thu Jun 4 21:45:45 2015 UTC,"You make some really good points, and I hadn't really thought about the line ""fear leads to anxiety"" that much before you mentioned it. And now that I've thought about it, I still can't come up with a real concrete way of explaining what that means.  As for the bridge (I think it's a bridge, maybe it's the third verse, I'm not sure), I think that the presence of religious hypocrisy and a flawed system that Tyler mentions definitely is partially responsible for the doubt he feels. Being a Christian myself, I know that hypocrisy in the church is inevitable because we are all still sinners. However, it can be discouraging to see so many people who call themselves ""Christians"" acting in ways contrary to their beliefs. Tyler probably had his fair share of experiences with this kind of behavior at church, and seeing Christians acts in a non-Christlike manner made him doubt the legitimacy of Christianity as a whole. He possibly saw church elders who had the final say in matters just because they were elders, not specifically because they were correct. Every Sunday he probably noticed himself having to repeat the same words over and over, and it made him wonder whether they actually meant anything at all. The negative experiences with religion probably only furthered his doubt in God. I think the other thing that contributes to his doubt is human nature. We constantly want proof and instant answers to our questions. We tend to rely on ourselves and think that we always know best. We seriously question the rationality of there being any kind of god, due to a lack of empirical evidence. All of these facts of human nature contribute to Tyler's doubt in God. I obviously can't 100% for certain say that this is Tyler's case, but it seems to be the case for many Christians.   I think that overall, Tyler recognizes that he is going to doubt God no matter what. Sometimes that doubt may grow, sometimes it might shrink. But he knows that God doesn't change, and doesn't break his promises, so Tyler ultimately places his faith in God's hands."

twentyonepilots,38bw7q,SpaghettiYos,2,Wed Jun 3 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree here! As a graphic design nut, it's not a bad start, but it needs some major work to get it final copy. The font is the first thing that needs to be changed. It doesn't really seem to fit the vibe you're going for. It's too ""machine-made-handwriting"" looking. I'll keep my eyes out for some other good replacements."

I would usually download a font that would fit the vibe a bit better but this was just what I had. I also only made it in like 2 days so it's not great. I just felt like sharing.

Suddenly, a dark figure walks out onto the stage. Security runs over to stop whatever it is, but it lashes back at them, sending them flying across the stage. The figure reveals itself as Blurryface.  Tyler and Josh try to play a secret song to defeat him, but Blurryface then kicks them both out of the band. Blurryface spots Jenna in the crowd and takes her away. Feeling defeated, the two heroes must surf on Josh's drums across the crowd to reach them. As Blurryface gets trapped into a corner of the venue, Tyler screams as loud as he can into his microphone.   Fireworks. Confetti. The crowd cheering. All of this happens as Josh does a back-flip, kicking Blurryface in the process. Jenna falls down into Tyler's arms. She slaps him for being so stupid, and then pulls him in for a kiss. They walk through the crowd, everyone speechless, and then continue to perform.  Sick as frick, yo."

I'm from the UK, I got into TØP around December last year after having tried to listen to their songs before and not really been able to get into it despite seeing people rave about them online. I came across ""Forest"" and was playing it on repeat while writing an essay. After that I looked up some of their live videos and was hooked. The honesty of Tyler's lyrics just amazed me.   I'm not super-familiar with the Clique but their creativity amazes me and the understanding that we share that we're all broken people with struggles encourages me a lot.   It's not exactly an inside joke, but if you haven't seen this video yet it's one of the best things.   What TØP songs mean the most to you?  I hope your CD/t-shirt arrives soon! The physical CD is awesome, and a t-shirt I ordered (not the new one) just arrived today and I'm loving it."

SO I finally did and wound up watching  TØP videos for a good 45 mins LOL.  I'd say at present probably Stressed Out. It gives me chills everytime I listen to it. And it just really fits my life right now. STRESSEEDD OUTTT. BEING AN ADULT HAS ME STRESSSEDDD OUTTT.  That's so awesome!

twentyonepilots,388nik,RockLobster17,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, does anybody know what kind of set TOP will do now with Blurryface? I'd imagine they'd do mainly just Blurryface and maybe a cover or two of songs (e.g. Falling in Love, Jar of Hearts, Brown Eyed Girl), but is there a chance they'd play any older songs?"
twentyonepilots,388nik,hannahbear94,2,Tue Jun 2 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"I hope they play some of their older songs, too.  IDK, most bands build and go back to the crowd favorites.  Car Radio, Closer To You, Trees, Ode To Sleep come to mind as possibilities.  Maybe even Kitchen Sink.  But TOP isn't most bands, and they wrote Blurryface with the intent of playing every song live, which means no time for throw back songs."

I mean a .iso or .bin / .cue file of the CD must be better quality. It's a 1:1 replica copy in full not using a program to rip the audio into a .flac file. Can't you then make .flac files from a .iso ? Just wondering what you guys use .flac files for ? Am I missing a piece of audio equipment that plays .flac files ? just want someone to enlighten me about this - Thanks guys
twentyonepilots,384l8c,21stPilot,4,Tue Jun 2 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"My guess is that .flac files are easier to deal with. Want to listen to a single song off an album? Search and play it, no scrubbing.  Source: The rectal repository"
twentyonepilots,384l8c,2unlit2quit,2,Tue Jun 2 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"WAV is ""easier to deal with"" as it is compatible with just about everything. FLAC saves a lot of space, that's the only difference it has (and it uses a tiny bit more computer power to play), but some programs like iTunes won't play the files whereas WAV is more universal."
twentyonepilots,384l8c,2unlit2quit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"FLAC files are the exact same audio quality as WAV (or ISO...ISO is just the WAV files organized exactly how they are on the disc). It's lossless compression, so it saves a ton of space without losing any data. think of it as a ZIP or RAR or 7z for audio. So we like WAV too, but if you are going to upload it, might as well upload it as FLAC as it will take a lot less time and save you money if you have a bandwidth limit :) and yes, if you have a FLAC file with a cue file, you can convert it back to an ISO. If you just have the FLAC files, you can extract it to WAV which is the exact bit for bit individual audio files from the CD."
twentyonepilots,384l8c,ilega_dh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"I want FLAC files because they are the highest quality you can possibly get. Lossless means that every single bit is copied everyone you convert the file to another lossless format (like ALAC, I use that for iTunes) so you're not losing quality. A .iso file would give you the same quality and yes, you can rip FLAC from .iso without losing quality. :)  Edit: Lol thanks for the downvote, I guess I wasn't contributing to the discussion."

I tried Anathema once while sleeping, it was really relaxing and I fell asleep really quickly. However, the climax left me jolting awake each time, regardless of what number it was on my playlist. I can imagine this would be the same with Slowtown and Goner, their climaxes are just too loud and would definitely ruin someone's sleeping routine :D Good work on the other songs though, I have to put Ruby on their too, but just cut the song off before the 'You're an Angel' section, as it does have a very suitable section to cut off at (it even fades out)."

twentyonepilots,3810f2,wonkafire613,3,Mon Jun 1 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Sometime late 2012 or early 2013 my brother and I were watching music videos on MTV while getting ready for school one morning. We're kind of just talking, and then came the event that changed my life: Holding On To You started playing. We both just stared at the TV for a few seconds, and stared at each other in disbelief. The visuals, the music, everything was just so amazing. We hadn't heard anything like it before. Eventually, after playing it a couple more times, we had to go to school.  Cut to that night. I had been working on a Redstone calculator in Minecraft for a while (this was during middle school, so I still played Minecraft a lot), and I worked on it some more that night too. And I played Holding On To You again while I built. After the song was over, I wanted to hear it again. And again. And again. At this point, I decided I wanted to memorize the lyrics that night.  I listened to Holding On To You for six hours straight, if I remember correctly. I was too obsessed with this one song to play any other song by them. But eventually I listened to Car Radio and Guns for Hands. After I played those over and over, too, I bought Vessel. It was actually for my brother, so I bought it and had to wait a month to give it to him for his birthday. I wanted to wait until he opened it on his birthday to listen to the remaining songs on the album.  The morning of his birthday, we listened through Vessel, and I loved every second of it. From that day on, I lived a twenty one pilots kind of life.  I hesitantly listened to the band's older songs (I'm very wary to listen to new music, I'm not really sure why. It scares me in a way.) I found out about the clique, looked deeper into the songs, and grew as a fan. I even bought a ukulele because of Tyler. I remember this subreddit having only a few hundred subscribers, actually. The next year I got to see the boys in concert (Charlotte NC, April 6th 2014) and I honestly regard that as the best night of my life. From then on, I've felt more at home with my clique than I ever have before. It's been an amazing ride, and I'm so excited to see what the boys have in store for us in the years to come.  Edit: Added stuff."

Since then I have loved the band more than I have ever loved anything. I'm so happy to see how far Tyler has come since then."

twentyonepilots,3810f2,ASovietSpy,2,Mon Jun 1 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"It was actually this past March when this guy who goes to my college and lives near my hometown connected with each other to carpool home for Spring Break. When we were driving back to the campus (like a nine hour drive), I had my iPod in the car jack listening to the iTunes Alternative radio station. After a few hours, this guy (who's name was Forest) is like ""Hey there's this band called Twenty One Pilots who I think you'll really like based off of what kinda music you seem to listen to"" and I'm like ""sure I'll try it"" and so he starts playing Vessel on his phone through Spotify and he says it's one of the most cohesive and creative albums he's ever heard. So we listen to it and I am struck by Ode to Sleep, like stunned by the way he effortlessly changes the tempo and style of the music is incredible.  We go through the tracks on the CD and by the time I've listened to Screen I bought the album on my iPhone and relistened over and over to Semi automatic and Ode to Sleep and Holding on to You because I loved them sooooo much. Later in April I went back to listen to the songs I had missed starting with Truce than Trees (fell in love with Trees) and than the Run and Go which I've since listened to more than 75 time according to iTunes on my computer and finally Fake you Out which I initially didn't like as much but now has grown on me especially the rap part. Which brings me to why I like them so much.  The lyrics are deep and say what I feel and I connect with them so much. I love their genre bending style and extremely introspective. Also the fact that they are often able to rap and scream and sing in sometimes within the same song is incredible. The way that their songs flow and sound is infectious. I recently ventured out to Self Titled and Regional at Best and I'm amazed with their abilities to change sound and yet sound like twenty one pilots that we all know and recognize."
twentyonepilots,3810f2,open-aperture96,2,Mon Jun 1 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"I walked around aimlessly at my university and ended up in a building I never had a class in. My wife and I sat on a bench to talk and take a break. During a dull moment, I picked up a flyer for concerts coming soon. We decided we were going to do something completely out of our character and go to a concert. We went back and forth on whether to pick Paramore or Fall Out Boy and decided with the latter since I loved Save Rock and Roll and also Panic! At the Disco was opening. It wasn't until the day of the show I was walking back from the concession stand when I heard Ode to Sleep with girls behind me squealing that The Phoenix had started. Clearly two different songs but I thought maybe it was a new song from Panic! I remember getting a scary vibe from skeleton suits and the music but thought it was very cool. Looked the band up later the next day and slowly grew to liking them. Almost right after I decided that I really did like them, I decided I loved them. It was that fast. It's like there's no just liking the band. You either hate them or love them.   I recently realized how nearly they weren't in my life. We took a random stroll, out of the ordinary, found a random flyer, decided to go to our first concert, we NEVER go anywhere or follow through with plans, and it just so happened that we got there early enough for an opening act we didn't even know was playing. Everything was so out of character for us that it's crazy it all came together like that. I even skipped class to go to this concert which was odd for me. That was two years ago, I'm thankful that I decided against my usual pessimistic instincts and that doing things and going places might actually be fun. That's depression for yeah."
twentyonepilots,3810f2,meagan51422,2,Mon Jun 1 05:55:58 2015 UTC,"It was September I believe of last year and this video was posted in /r/videos. This cover was very interesting which lead me to looking up the holding onto you music video. That song was played on repeat for at 3 weeks straight.  I did try listening to Car Radio but I just could not for the life of me get into it. After understanding the style of TOP the song grew on me and become one of my favorites for its unique style. Then what really made me apart of the clique is when I was driving home around 3 weeks after discovering them, I had just gotten off a 11 hour shift at work and decided to give the entire album of Vessel a try and played it on shuffle. Song after song just became better and better. Their rap/singing is just so refreshing and have been listening to them everyday since. Hope you enjoyed my story!"
twentyonepilots,3810f2,Itonic,2,Mon Jun 1 06:10:24 2015 UTC,"Right after Vessel was released. There was a video posted on reddit that had two dudes covering Holding onto You on the street and a guy came up and just started freestyling to it. Someone linked the actual song in the comments and I was blown away.  I fell in love with the shifts in genre within the song itself. The music video was another reason I got hooked. Tyler and Josh eminated this energy in their performance that I really enjoyed.  I've tried to introduce a lot of my friends to their music. I covered House of Gold at a Live 'Ukulele Concert which was a lot of fun, and some of the students told me later they couldn't stop playing it on their own ukes. I'm still a fairly new fan relative to how long they've been making music, but I feel like their careers have really taken off in the time I've grown as a fan."

That night I dove head first into Vessel, fell madly in love with Holding On To You (seriously that song changed my life), preordered Blurryface and haven't come back up for air since!

It was your usual tween pop nominees like Cody Simpson, but they mentioned some band I've never heard of and they played a clip of 'Holding on to You', so I looked up the song on YouTube. I think I listened to the song around a dozen times and I was totally in love with that song, but it wasn't until 'Fairly Local' came out that I decided to give TØP another listen. After picking apart the lyrics, they really resonated with me and I've been hooked ever since."

I noticed that there were almost no ""alternative"" songs on this list anymore, save for some old ones and twenty one pilots' Tear In My Heart and Stressed Out.  I listened to and loved both.  I got instantly super excited and felt so happy.  Coincidentally, this was the same day Blurryface was leaked.  I had no idea what was going on, or who Josh and Tyler were.  I had sworn that twenty one pilots was a duo of two brothers named Joseph and Josh...Still I listened to Blurryface and started flipping out about how great it was, one perfect song after the next.  I went back to investigate who these guys were and watched hundreds of videos on Youtube.  I realized that these were the same guys Fall Out Boy wore the shirts of and talked about (like in the history of FOB video) and that opened for Thirty Seconds to Mars.  Turns out that I had listened to Holding On To You years ago, in fact it's on of my recurring ""Watch Again"" videos on Youtube, but I'm not sure why I didn't dive into the rest of TOP earlier....  I also recognized Car Radio.  And I have the distinct feeling like I've heard Drown off No Phun Intended before, perhaps in a fan video or something.  Either way, in the matter of 24 hours I was off-the-moon couldn't-contain myself into twenty one pilots.  Every time I tried to listen to other music I'd just go back to Blurryface or their previous music.  At like 2 in the morning a couple days after I discovered them I bought a ticket to go see them in LA.  I'm so pumped."

At the time I was completely against anything that could be described as rap-ish, so I told him I wasn't interested and to stop trying to get me to listen. He wouldn't give up, so I went home and watched the music  video for Guns for Hands and it freaking pierced my soul. Ever since then my life has been consumed by those two boogers.

Twenty One Pilots- Holding onto you"" I was hesitant because I'm mostly a hip-hop head and my friend is so into bands like PTV but anyways I thought why not give it a listen. I put my headphones on and I heard the first piano chords and my first thought was ""Not another pop song"" but then I heard Tyler rap and I was like ""I've never heard anybody rap like this before"" it was something unique that he had a play of words and flow. Also when he started singing, I was even more amazed. Then I had that song on repeat while playing basketball. Then I needed to hear more songs so I played guns for hands and I loved it so much because I got the message instantly that ""this band is real, I'm relating to these lyrics and I needed to hear this, this band is real."" So I bought vessel and decided to dig deeper (this was all in a month) and downloaded RAB, Self Titled, and No Phun Intended. I searched for interviews and videos about them on YouTube. As well at the time I didn't know who I was, I didn't want to continue to be the person just known for basketball, I know there was more to me. My perspectives changed, the person I was at that time changed, my writing changed, my faith changed, my life completely changed but for the better. After months of just listening to their music, I understood people more and I tried and continue to help people and  I'm still trying to understand myself more through their lyrics. No other artists had done that to me and not even loving hip-hop could do that to me. So I thank them for saving me."

I listened to the rest of the album a while later, but lost intrest in them after a few weeks sadly. A few months ago, quite a while before blurry face was annouced I got back into them. Listened to vessel a few more times, then started listen to the self-titled album, which was quite a bit different.

My mom went inside a clinic to turn some stuff in, and we were waiting for her in the car. We had the radio on, but I wasn't really paying attention to it. I was playing around with my brother in the back seat when I heard the lyric: ""Sometimes quiet is violent."" Hearing that just made me stop what I was doing and keep listening to it. I connected with everything that Tyler was saying, and I just felt an instant connection to the song--something no other song had ever done to me. About halfway through the song, I pulled out my phone to use SoundHound to identify the song, and it came out as Car Radio by twenty one pilots. I screenshotted it and, when I got home, I began listening to them, and I just grew to love them."

I ended up selling my iPod later that year in June, so I lost all the music I had on it. The next January, I was singing the song in my head all day, and I couldn't remember what it was so I had to look it up. That was when I discovered Car Radio and Guns For Hands, and I just fell in love with those songs. Since then, twenty one pilots has been my favorite band.

The latest release hasn't been uploaded to soundcloud yet, but I will throw that and any new songs up on these folders as soon as they are released.   4 MP3 tracks from SoundCloud: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y2cew8wd9h9e2p2/AACvnk8rveTkCM7BT7_31vppa?dl=0  I downloaded the youtube 720p MP4's and used ffmpeg to losslessly extract the AAC audio from the MP4 container. I have those in M4A format and are the exact same quality as the youtube videos. Converting these to MP3 would not be recommended as even a 320 kbps MP3 convert will result in loss in fidelity.   5 M4A tracks from the ""tyler joseph"" YouTube: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x83phh4fubpdmtr/AAAd47Pk4agF5YlmmvlnyxGsa?dl=0  There are 192+ kbps MP3's floating around on tumblr and stuff but I analyzed them and they are all transcodes of the files in my dropbox up there. So right now the choice for these allphunintended releases is either dealing with SoundCloud's compression if you want MP3, or YouTube's compression if you want M4A. Unless someone can show otherwise, all ""higher quality"" or other MP3's floating around are transcodes."

And at the end, there's a resolution, That, ultimately, that thing that I was afraid for so long was the thing that saved me.""   So there is your explanation straight from his mouth.

twentyonepilots,37ypkw,robertbrysonhall,2,Sun May 31 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"C.S. Lewis said ""To love anything is to be vulnerable-- love anything and your heart will be wrung, and possibly broken"" and thats kind of what the song conveys.  His wife is someone who comes into his life and in order to have a relationship with her, he has to change who he is, and ""it takes someone to come around and show you how,"" as tyler says in the third(?) verse, thus the beating up.  My advice is also never take his lyrics out of context.  They really are all very interconnected.  One line has to be looked at in light of the whole song.  I always see people gettinghung up on ""My taste in music is your face.""  Alone, it is ridiculous sounding. The verse though is, ""The songs on the radio are ok/ but my taste in music is your face/ and it takes someone to come around to show you how'  In context, then, the music isnt songs-- its women.  He sees them all around them and thinks they are ok, but it isnt until he meets Jenna that he finds out that that is what he really wants."

twentyonepilots,37zifa,justafIeshwound,2,Sun May 31 18:56:13 2015 UTC,You already posted this and it makes so little sense..
twentyonepilots,37x917,lukeanator99,6,Sun May 31 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"The guy put up one source files and it was a rip from a CD at 128 kbps using iTunes. I asked him/her if he could rip it from the CD at 320 and he/she said that's the quality of the files. His only shown pictures of iTunes on his computer and not of any CD, so I suspect he/she wasn't necessarily the person who ripped the CD's and couldn't provide better rips. Now there not provided the source files anyway. The first time they put up a song on youtube, I asked for the source file, and they asked me where to upload it. After, they accidentally uploaded the source video, and not audio. Apparently there was also a tweet where the person had the location set to Ohio. Before the person was going by ""AllPhunIntended"", they had the tumblr page ""http://tylerjosephmakesmewet.tumblr.com/"" linked in the first video description.  Using this evidence, I think it's a fan girl, who lives close to Tyler's Hometown. I think maybe one of her friends had the original CD, and sent her the files. I think neither of them know much about computers b/c if they did we could of gotten better quality files.  When it comes to weather or not they should be leaked, it's kinda tricky. I am totally biased because I want to hear the songs so badly. On the other hand I could understand Tyler not necessarily wanting this many people to hear these songs, because 1) He might believe its not his best work. 2) when writing these songs he had no idea more than his family and friends would hear them. 3) He hasen't chosen to share these songs online himself, even back in 2010/2011 when TOP was alot smaller.  All that being said this whole thing kinda reminds me of what Tyler tweeted around the time blurryface was released, ""another piece of my soul is now on the internet.""  Honestly, If I thought these songs were terrible/something to be insecure about I would say, they shouldn't be shared with the world. Because that wouldn't be too nice. However, I think these songs are up there with the rest of Tylers writing. if ""Where Did We Go"" was remastered and on blurryface, it would be my favorite song on the album. So that being said I think we shouldn't feel bad for wanting to / listening to them.  I do think ""allphunintended"" is having a bit of power trip, and I wish they would just share the  whole album in the quality they have it.  I can't speak for tyler, but if I was him, the thing I would be most mad about is someone using they fact that they had unheard songs of mine to get them attention, and not just share them."
twentyonepilots,37x917,cocojackson,3,Sun May 31 04:38:25 2015 UTC,"3) He hasen't chosen to share these songs online himself, even back in 2010/2011 when TOP was alot smaller.   half the songs in the sidebar of ""old music"" tyler didn't release himself and were from fans who got a hold of one of the promo CD's at an early show. I think that Tyler wanted his fans to share this tracks with others if they liked it, something that he himself would not do to a wider audience like online."
twentyonepilots,37x917,2unlit2quit,2,Sun May 31 04:59:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't really think of it that way.

twentyonepilots,37x917,2unlit2quit,2,Sun May 31 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"he never said anything about any of his earlier singles surfacing, either. I doubt he really cares too much as it is only a very small portion of people who listen to TOP that are even hearing it. ""Dollhouse"" has less than 12k views, their official youtube channel has their TOP songs with over a million views + all the other plays from spotify, itunes, sales, etc."

twentyonepilots,37x917,2unlit2quit,1 point,Sun May 31 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"Haven't been following it much but I believe it was said that it is someone who said they lived near tyler, or where he (and josh?) grew up, and tyler gave out cds back then like many local kids do, but tyler only released certain songs online.  I don't know if that's changed at all, like if it's the same person, because that person was all about ""respecting tyler's privacy"" but it could very well be the same person because who doesn't love attention, right?  Personally I think it's just dumb and I'm not going to bother following it. Maybe I'll download them all when this is all over, but. Meh.  Also, if it isn't Tyler, or if it's someone who doesn't have permission from Tyler, it's a totally shitty move. He must've has(or had) the songs, he could've put them online if he wanted.  Edit: Totally random, but as I was kind of twitter stalking his sister as it was like everywhere that she is getting married (sorz - i was bored), she had a picture of that cd that the person showed. It was captured like ""true fans know this"" or ""old fans know this"" something like that. So it's a real cd."
twentyonepilots,37x917,DJLusciousEagle,2,Sun May 31 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't tyler always tell people to share his music when he was starting out?   Tyler has said that he put the songs that he chose from RAB onto Vessel because those where the ones that he really wanted reaching people and going to a wider audience.   The No Phun Intended tracks that aren't on his PureVolume seem to be mostly the same message as other tracks that he has released so it would be redundant for him to put out every track that he has created (he has pages of singles in his library that he made when he was starting out). None of them are really polished or ready for the mainstream, like RAB, but I think that if someone wants to search out his earlier works and if it helps someone, then he is all for it.   Also he might be considering Josh's feelings if Tyler starts releasing his solo works. These tracks are mostly just Tyler singing and playing the piano, and he's barely just okay with performing as a two-man act so I don't think that he wants to push his solo work out onto iTunes or anything."

twentyonepilots,37x917,2unlit2quit,1 point,Sun May 31 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"One: I didn't follow the Josh argument at all. No Phun Intended was put online, what does how many tracks on the album matter? And iTunes? What. (Honestly, I'm just confused.)  Two: I'm not saying this is a huge deal, because it's most likely not, I just think it's shady af. This person waits until they're at the biggest yet and then drops this info to probably the most boundary pushing online fan community there is.  And using the whole ""tyler wanted his music to be shared"" thing doesn't do anything towards my opinion on it because I don't really care the reason why they're not online. They're not. End of.   Could be redundancy (but redundant enough to keep offline, but not redundant enough to put on a cd and give to people? I don't see the sense in that), could be he doesn't think they were as good or he ended up thinking ""maybe not these."" The reason doesn't really matter to me.  I'm just not digging this whole thing surrounding the person putting them online. Periscopes, tumblr account, drip drip twitter messages? Who are you? Tyler? What are you doing? This person honestly just wants the attention or they would've just put it all online in one go."

I don't really know what kind of venue it is (so whether the ""nosebleeds"" you're talking about are truly top section stadium seats or just balcony), but for the show that I went to last Fall, in more of a theater type venue, everyone in the place had energy, even the people in the back or in balcony seats. Tyler even showed up at the front of the balcony for a song during the encore. I've seen other bands in arena settings that have made good use of the space, running through crowds, disappearing and coming back out a balcony entrance, etc. TØP is a really awesome concert environment, and I'm sure they'll do whatever they can to make every part of the audience feel included."

Their vocalist has a really strong falsetto that he sings in for half their songs. Idk if they're still making music or not, as they've had several lineup changes and only one full album  Jukebox the Ghost is actually my favorite band. They're a piano pop trio with two vocalists who each sing backup in the songs that the other one writes. Half of their first album is about the end of the world and it's fantastic  Flobots is a political rap group with two MCs. You might have heard Handlebars on the radio a couple years ago.

twentyonepilots,37wwh1,StanzakJ1,6,Sun May 31 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Watching this video, I think I figured out the progression.  The verses are a standard D, F# and G (you can just hold the same positioning if you barre the F# and slide it up to the G).  Prechorus is an A7 to an A.  G starts the chorus, to an A then quickly to a Bm. Then he plays a variation of A (number 3/15 by the tuning pegs), to D followed by A and letting it linger.  The bridge is a D, then you slide up to an F# (number 6/9 by the tuning pegs) and G (number 8/12).  Hope that helps!"

twentyonepilots,37wwh1,grayleikus,3,Sun May 31 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I started working on Ride afterwards. One of my favorites off of Blurryface.  The verse and chorus is all one progression:  F# 3x | G#m (I prefer the 2nd position) 1x | D#m 3x | B 1x  All strummed on the 2nd and 4th beat, reggae-style.  The bridge is a little different.  F# I've been thinking too much | G#m | C# I've been thinking too much  D#m | G#7sus4 (As close as the uke can get to that specific chord - I love how it sounds on the piano) I've been thinking too much  D#m | C# I've been thinking too much | C# (or even C#6) Help | F# me and repeat.  Getting your fingers in the right positions quickly takes some practice, but it's such a fun song to jam with.   Also, I love it when Tyler folds his arms in the video. Idk why."

twentyonepilots,37uxbz,x_ray,31,Sat May 30 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"I think this song is very reminiscent (lyrically) of the songs on Vessel. Tyler is sort of a messenger who speaks on behalf of the people who can't or won't speak for themselves about their demons. ""Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man."" The comma is important here. You can hear it as both an attack on Tyler or an attack on what he's saying. Many people don't understand the intricacies and the seriousness of depression and its effects on those who suffer from it. Sometimes the way people talk about it is very insensitive or even flat out incorrect. I've had similar conversations myself.   This song feels very 'in-your-face' to me. Tyler is standing up for others and reminding them to remember the future. The future is bright. In the future joy can be found. Just hang in there.   Sometimes I wonder if Tyler writes about himself in the third person or about somebody he knows ( or knew...) who is suicidal. The verses of the song remind me of some older TOP stuff (references to day and night, masks, something to hide).     To me it comes down to this:  You may think you understand me, think everything's fine, think you know what's going on, but there's so much more. I've harmed myself or others with this condition - a crime that keeps me on the run. Maybe I won't ever tell you. Maybe I'm embarrassed. Songs like this are sung by messengers for those who need it, who can't say something or won't say it. The message may come off as being ""emo"" or whatever, but that isn't right. These are real people with real problems. Do not sully their emotions or their lives. Do not mess with the message, man. You're messing with the Message Man. These are my people."
twentyonepilots,37uxbz,Block_After_Block,7,Sat May 30 19:10:04 2015 UTC,I really like the last paragraph. I think you've nailed it.
twentyonepilots,37uxbz,KyasakoKana,7,Sat May 30 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"I personally feel the overall message of the song is ""Remember the future."" The chorus repeats ""Release me from the present"" multiple times. Also, parts of his rap references the future ""Gets better when morning finally rears it's head"" and ""Remember the morning is when night is dead.""  Release me from the present because it's depressing, but remember that the future is filled with hope.  As for who the Message Man is and why he is on the run, I'm not 100% but I have a guess. First lyrics are ""A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise."" So either the Message Man is the mask, or the face behind the mask that would probably be hiding because it felt like it has done awful things. On the run from possible guilt?   As for the discretion part, I think it means speak carefully when you are talking to the mask/real me because I'm fighting for hope and all these questions are distracting me from the future.   This might not make any sense, but it's my best guess."
twentyonepilots,37uxbz,QueenofSass,4,Sat May 30 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"I think this song does have multiple themes, but it's all tied up in insecurities, which goes along with Blurryface as a whole.   To begin with Tyler is talking about how people don't see him as he truly is, and that he's far worse than people see him as and he's caught up in that. So he's looking and hoping to the future, away from ""obsessing all these questions"" (going along with the idea of thinking too much from Ride, or even Migraine).   Another major part of the song is cautioning against interpreting his lyrics, I think, because people never see the true him. But then he acknowledges that even if it's only a few, a few do understand. Kind of like when he talks about ""the few, the proud and the emotional"" in Fairly Local.   ""My people singing"" therefore refers to those who do understand, I think, and therefore ""a loser"" from the beginning of the song becomes ""together we're losers"" by the end of the fourth verse, and points towards hope in the future again.   There's still a lot I didn't unpack, like most of the rap... it's definitely complicated, haha. The part that resonates with me the most is the message (ha) of looking to the future."
twentyonepilots,37uxbz,KyasakoKana,3,Sat May 30 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I totally agree with this. To me I feel like this is the song on the album where Tyler becomes most transparent.   We don't really know him or Josh but a lot of us talk like we do. We listen to the music, read the lyrics, watch the interviews, go to shows, some of us actually get to meet them. But at the end of the day, we don't really know them, we know of them, we know a lot about them, but we'll never really know them. Because of this it's easy to put them in boxes, to assign meanings to their lyrics, to have ideas about the type of people they are, why they do the things they do, how they feel about certain things etc. It's so easy for us to put them up on a pedestal or to rip them to shreds.  The thing is We don't know their brain the way we know their name and we don't know their heart the way we know their face. We don't know what they've done, because we've all done things we're not proud of, all of the time, all of us.   I think the chorus is them stressing about all of the questions they're asked all the time, about their lyrics, their shows, fans, persona, futures, everything. Insecurity creeps in. When you're out there in front of everyone it's easy for them to get picked and teased apart. A lot of people won't be using discretion with them, they'll tamper with the message or worse, the messenger. Their fears or expressed here.  Their music isn't for everyone, obviously. There are the FPE.  I think the bridge/rap is Tyler just talking about how he's a guy who just loves to write music and he likes to write music to help people like himself. Then he starts to tell his listeners that it's support from us, the clique that can keep this music getting out there, helping others the way that they'd want it. Then it's like a ""we're in this together"" kind of thing, ""you and me both know things will get better, we're both outsiders, so lets tell others the same thing""."
twentyonepilots,37uxbz,nevercomemonday,3,Sun May 31 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"The part that stuck out to me is ""You're dead because how could you sleep at a time like this."" When I was at the low point of my depression, I would just sleep for hours and hours, no matter how long I had slept previously. I would drag myself out for class and work, but had no energy to pursue anything else. What that line means to me is how much life depression sucks out of you, almost as if you were dead, because how can you sleep when it feels like everything around you is crumbling apart? Shouldn't you want to fix it? Or at least try?  When he says ""I'm the kind of guy who/takes every moment he knows he confided in/music to use it for others to use it"", it makes me think that he is using his own demons and his own experiences to give a voice to the others who can't or won't. He's giving us an outlet for our own suffering through his words and, and allowing us to use his voice to find our own. I think that part kind of ties into the first line, ""A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise"" and then at the end ""Togerther we're losers remember the future"".   That's what I've got so far, I'm still puzzling a bit over a few things. :)"

twentyonepilots,37viac,bopll,2,Sat May 30 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"Because the shows are sold out resellers will raise the price crazy high to try and sucker people into buying them.

twentyonepilots,37viac,btfsame,1 point,Sat May 30 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"You're always going to get high prices by going through third party sellers. Most of the time the prices go up because people suck, but sometimes it's just the fact that the site itself might take a cut, so to get what they paid people have to raise the prices or they lose out money.  Try social media first. Craigslist, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. Also, call the venue! When I called Ticketmaster they said that tickets are split numerous ways, and if the venue has the service to buy tickets they might have some. Then I'd say go for Ticketsnow. They're Ticketmaster's third party site (and therefore verified through Ticketmaster). Usually the most inexpensive I've found. Plus, it's nice knowing I can call up Ticketmaster instead of some site I don't know for information."
twentyonepilots,37viac,hannahbear94,1 point,Sat May 30 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, compared to other tours (esp. pop artists) the fact that their LA show was around $40 after service fees for ANY seat seemed very cheap and fair to me.  Usually at LA shows, pit tickets or seats close to the stage are $200+ so only wealthy people can get them.  Same trend in sports.  Basically, this is a music industry issue.  Also, scalpers buy the tickets really fast and price them super high.  I know TOP used to have $15 tickets but now they have bigger venues which require a certain dollar amount back.  These venues don't care how many tickets you sell, just that you pay them what you agreed upon."

twentyonepilots,37riqq,DJLusciousEagle,7,Fri May 29 20:27:35 2015 UTC,I like the other music idea. That'd be cool to find some great new music.
twentyonepilots,37riqq,SpaghettiYos,7,Fri May 29 20:43:59 2015 UTC,Maybe we could have a weekly thread where we put the CyTube to use. I think it'd be a great opportunity for the community to get together and jam out to tøp songs while chatting.  Edit: CyTube Saturdays could be a potential name.
twentyonepilots,37riqq,ilega_dh,2,Fri May 29 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"I just took a look at this, but isn't it the same as Plug.DJ? Except, Plug.DJ looks a lot better so wouldn't that be better?"
twentyonepilots,37riqq,SpaghettiYos,1 point,Sun May 31 16:37:15 2015 UTC,"CyTube is already set up and functioning. We could use Plug.DJ as an alternative, but I don't really see why we would stop using CyTube. I'm just glad I can jam out with the clique, honestly. Doesn't really matter to me if it looks good or not. CyTube also has a bit more customization to it, from what I've heard. If you want to run a Plug.DJ, I won't stop you from recommending it to the mods. I just wanna chill with my family :)"
twentyonepilots,37riqq,needbettername77,9,Sun May 31 17:09:12 2015 UTC,I think a weekly song meaning discussion would be cool
twentyonepilots,37riqq,lostmesa,2,Sat May 30 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good idea. Now here's a question (for anyone). If we had a weekly thread like that, would you want us to police all of the other threads posted? It would just be if someone posted a question about some lyrics, we would delete it, and send a friendly message saying to wait to post this question on the designated day. Or we could just let it go and have both."
twentyonepilots,37riqq,KyasakoKana,2,Sat May 30 15:12:53 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a good idea to stifle other posts just because of the weekly schedule.

twentyonepilots,37riqq,archbox,1 point,Fri May 29 21:47:02 2015 UTC,When it's fully out officially (as official as Tyler can actually make that) we can have a new sticky.
twentyonepilots,37riqq,schneidmaster,3,Fri May 29 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"This is a little bit of a different suggestion that doesn't have to do with weekly threads.

twentyonepilots,37riqq,archbox,2,Fri May 29 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, /u/TOP_Bot could do this"
twentyonepilots,37riqq,solidrighthook,1 point,Sat May 30 23:34:35 2015 UTC,It could but I'm not really sure what the point would be tbh. Videos get posted to the sub quickly enough by actual users anyway.
twentyonepilots,37riqq,not_todayy,1 point,Sun May 31 04:45:13 2015 UTC,"cuz then when people post, you can include a note saying not to post official twenty one pilots videos as the bot does it :) otherwise you get a dozen topics about each video.

twentyonepilots,37riqq,Im_A_Boonana,3,Sun May 31 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"I like the ideas of these threads as they'd encourage some fun discussion, would it be possible to get them stickied?"
twentyonepilots,37riqq,21stPilot,2,Fri May 29 20:44:04 2015 UTC,Subs don't usually do that. I think we'd have to change it manually every day. If you all remember to upvotes them we'll never have that problem.
twentyonepilots,37riqq,ArminIsBae,2,Fri May 29 20:49:49 2015 UTC,I think itd be a good idea to get the threads that run weekly like the creations one stickied because after a couple of days it wouldnt be on the what's hot list anymore. But for the threads that run for one day like other music day then yeah upvotes should do it

The two are in the same vein, and sometimes the subgenre of emo, ""Screamo,"" is used to describe metalcore/post-hardcore. Screamo is like a dissonant emo, and uses predominantly screaming, where screaming is not as common in traditional modern emo. So they stem from emo, but it's like comparing The Beatles to Arctic Monkeys."

twentyonepilots,37saco,levankid,1 point,Sat May 30 08:42:09 2015 UTC,"However, there is nothing wrong with referring to them as emo because emo is short for emotive   Emo, in popular slang, is short for overly dramatic and emotional music that serves no greater purpose than to get young teenagers all worked up about this and that. Specifically, it exploits a particular emotion as a cheap way of appearing artistic. Here's an example: In a song about a break-up, the band Hawthorne Heights repeatedly screams and sings the line, ""So cut my wrists and black my eyes / so I can fall asleep tonight"""
twentyonepilots,37saco,dtoxtwelve,1 point,Sat May 30 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"i mean i'm just gonna say tøp is definitely dramatic and emotional and those are two things i love dearly about their music.  I'm not sure how much of either makes it too much, but i certainly can see why they're called an emo band, just as much as i can see why people sometimes call them an edm group"
twentyonepilots,37saco,levankid,1 point,Sun May 31 02:55:52 2015 UTC,"Just direct people who call them emo to this http://isthisbandemo.com/?band=twenty+one+pilots .  Seriously though, maybe it's me feeling nostalgic about sixth grade, but I don't have as negative of a connotation with the ""emo"" label as others seem to have.  It was just another evolution of music.  And with every movement, you get the good and the bad, the trendy and the important.  Given how often Tyler writes about death in his lyrics, including poetic fascination with/an attraction towards death, I understand why people might call TOP ""emo."" ""Sundays are my suicide days"" ""As a crazy suicidal head case"" ""I swear I heard demons yelling"" ""'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside."" ""That you all have guns, And you never put the safety on, And you all have plans, To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it.""  etc. They also, like early emo bands, have ""hardcore"" inspiration.  But yeah they aren't ""emo"" musically or part of the ""emo revival"" movement or anything."

twentyonepilots,37n38n,TransPM,3,Fri May 29 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"Not Today is my favorite song on the whole album along with Ride.

At first listen, I thought it was a bit too generic, serious and fillery like Doubt, but upon subsequent listens, I really do like it. On a side note, does anybody else think that the electronic bit that plays when he goes ""da da da da, we have problems"" after the bridge sound just like the synth part from the rap breakdown in Guns for Hands? I wonder if they actually lifted it, or if it was intentionally meant to sound like that."

Hilarious seeing that Holding Onto You is one of my favorite songs of all time and the Simply Having a Wonderful Christmastime is one of my least favorites. Just an awful song. I totally see the similarities in the intros though which is bizarre."

twentyonepilots,37mdni,Beavebaketallion,1 point,Thu May 28 18:22:04 2015 UTC,just a short one. maybe like 1-3 sentences.
twentyonepilots,37lhtw,rileyb102797,26,Thu May 28 14:22:04 2015 UTC,"IMO, the most lyrically superb song from t.o.p. is ""Be Concerned"" in Regional at Best, which I think is about Tyler pondering his belief in God.   Where'd ya go, huh?  They don't think I know ya..  It's so hard to motivate me to devote  a single inch of me  to something I can't see.  I don't mean to pry,   but why  would you even make the eyes?  I don't believe my ears  and I'm scared of my own head  I will deny you for years   and I'll make you raise me from the dead.  And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return,  well I'm sorry Mr. Gullible, but lying's all I've learned..  so be concerned."

twentyonepilots,37lhtw,face-_-it,14,Thu May 28 21:36:56 2015 UTC,I agree on Addict with a Pen but the rap verse in Forest...man I love it so much!

twentyonepilots,37lhtw,SnakeMilker,5,Thu May 28 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"The whole of Taxi Cab tops it for me every time. At first I just liked the rap, but the more I listen to it the more meaning the whole thing has for me, and then the rap just takes it one step further at the end.    Then there were three men up front  All I saw were backs of heads  And then I asked them, ""Am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead?""  And then one turned around to say,  ""We're driving toward the morning sun  Where all your blood is washed away  And all you did will be undone.""  I said, ""Don't be afraid."""
twentyonepilots,37lhtw,KyasakoKana,6,Thu May 28 22:01:02 2015 UTC,March to the Sea is absolutely incredible. Addict with a Pen. Fall Away. Clear. They are all so good.

twentyonepilots,37h4yx,522DTO,13,Wed May 27 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think he meant it as an insult. If we were at album #5 or 6 then it would be an insult but at this early in their career it isn't an insult. Without any top 40 mainstream radio hits, the music HAS to be strong in order to perform well commercially. The band isn't a ""phenomenon"" yet. I think I heard ""Holding Onto You"" MAYBE once on the radio or somewhere outside of my own listening. Having fans at this point means the music is still good...because what other reason do we have to listen? Would you guys keep listening if the music sucked? Most of us wouldn't...we're die hards but not hard-core die hards yet.  Now if the same was said about ""St. Anger"" - notorious for being an awful effort from Metallica - then yes, it would be an insult."

twentyonepilots,37h4yx,MFaith93,6,Wed May 27 17:32:48 2015 UTC,Yeah man... All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless...

twentyonepilots,37lfl4,Antir0b0t,9,Thu May 28 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this is just meant to be funny, not serious. We aren't elitists around here, we want as many people to like and love the band as we can. No need to call someone out or make fun of them just because they aren't as much of a fan to realize that the band's name isn't spelled that way."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,Ejohnson930,3,Thu May 28 14:28:02 2015 UTC,I've been a fan years now and you can still catch me abbreviating it to 21p instead of TOP.  Just a preference.
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,grobo555,2,Thu May 28 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I've never heard about this before. What's so bad about writing it as 21 Pilots instead of Twenty One Pilots?"
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,Ejohnson930,7,Thu May 28 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well the official band name is  Twenty One Pilots, so some people don't like it when others write it as 21 instead of spelling it out.  Honestly though, it isn't a big deal. The music is sick as frick, so no need to worry about the way you spell the title."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,grobo555,1 point,Thu May 28 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thanks! I've loved their music for a long time, but I thought I might've been missing something bigger here."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,meagan51422,5,Thu May 28 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"It's not so much of a big deal but generally huge fans of the band like to spell it out because that's the real name of the band. I've always tied it into Tyler's reason for the name of the band. He said it's a reminder for him to never take the easy way out with his shows and to always be as enthusiastic as possible. Of course, he's referring to a play he read but that's what the twenty one pilots represents within the play. I'm sure no one else sees it this way but personally, it's a nice tip of the hat to their hard work and dedication."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,grobo555,1 point,Thu May 28 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"I like it. I've always referred to them as Twenty One Pilots rather than 21 Pilots, but I was unaware that there was that much to the whole thing (not that I'm surprised)."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,Ryan_cdn13,3,Fri May 29 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"The reason for this for everyone wondering is that in an interview Tyler mentions he picked ""twenty one pilots"" instead of ""21 pilots"" because so many bands use numbers in their names so he wanted something different.   EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkoqxx6oRSI The very first question in this interview is about this"
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,SnakeMilker,5,Thu May 28 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"One thing that no one else noted here is that they used to have a shirt that said ""Spell It Out"" on it."
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,Cciamlazy,2,Sat May 30 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone that it's no big deal to abbreviate twenty one but I believe I remember Josh saying in an interview they search ""21 pilots"" on Twitter to sort through their haters. Even at I Heart radio the hashtag was changed from #iHeart21Pilots to #iHeartTwentyOnePilots"
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,ArcticFr0st,3,Thu May 28 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with using ""21""?if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure Tyler and/or Josh has used it before as well. Don't be a bandwagon"
twentyonepilots,37lfl4,CanadaluvsTOP,2,Thu May 28 16:03:12 2015 UTC,Twenty One is literally just 21 spelled out. 21P or 21 Pilots is just shorthand. I don't mind at all.

A friend of mine had sent me some new music to listen to that I put all together into a playlist (probably about 5-6 albums in total). I put the playlist on one day while cleaning my house, enjoying most of what I was hearing, then Ode to Sleep came on. I didn't even know what to think. I just stood there and listened. I'd never heard anything like it before, and honestly I've probably never heard anything just like it since either. A seamless blend of 3 distinct styles that somehow just worked, plus great lyrics and awesome wrapping? It didn't take me nearly as long as you to make the dive the rest of the way in.

That advice has a good chance of being complete bullshit.  You never know what you're going to get at a show ever. It's not just filled with the online fandom. There are no rules about crowdsurfing, there are no rules about getting all over each other (though there is a chance people get called out if they're overly aggressive), it's a pit.   I've been to about six or seven of their shows over the years and they've been getting rougher and rougher in the pit. The last two I came home bruised and sore. The second to last one I actually made my way out of the pit and went up to the next level where everything was calmer and I could relax. And at the last one I had someone wrap their arms around my neck because he decided it was easier for him I suppose that when his arms weren't up cheering or taking a video, they were to be on me. So I got yanked when he moved, and it was like I wasn't in control over my body. Thankfully I'm always very up close at the barrier so I did have some stability to grab hold to, but I spoke to a few people afterwards who said they actually went down because the rush of the crowd.  Pits are rough. Pits can be really rough. Plan for that going in. Know what you could be in for. If you still wanna hop into that pit, do it. Because it probably won't be what stays with you at the end of the show. Because it is one of the best shows you'll ever see. Ever."

twentyonepilots,37gxyd,djkcoop,7,Wed May 27 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with clinical or in other words severe depression a couple months ago. I lost interest in EVERYTHING including music. I've contemplated suicide and have attempted it twice now. I was talking to one of my friends and they just replied with ""I really think you should hear this."" And linked me Car Radio. I loved it. The lyrics spoke to me like no other song has before. I listened to their other songs. I listened to Regional at Best and the self titled. I listened to Vessel and around this time they released Fairly Local. I was excited that they were releasing a new album soon. Excited!? I haven't felt excited about anything in a long long time! I was here when Blurryface leaked the album and everyone was desperately trying to find it. I didn't want to buy it then because even though Ghost Tunes is official I still wanted it on iTunes. I followed the band on Twitter and once I read the tweet about them releasing it a couple days early on iTunes I started crying. I cried during the entire Blurryface album and I loved everything about it.  Twenty One Pilots has now become the only music I listen to. I don't listen to any other music because as they say in Holding on to You ""Lean with it, rock with it. When we gonna stop with it? Lyrics that mean nothing we were gifted with thought."" And that's exactly how I feel about most other music.  TOP was the first band to make me cry during a song and I've never felt so emotionally connected to any other bands or music.  So that's why I love TOP.  :)  |-/"

I was that way for the first months that I found TOP, right after Vessel released.  But, I've learned to make room for other favorite bands, too.  I listen to a diverse selection of artists, and I still listen to and play TOP songs a lot, but allow me to recommend a couple artists with songs that will make you lean, rock, and that have extraordinary lyrics similar to TOP's:  Passion Pit - One guy, one very dark, beautiful, and developing story.  He sings of his depression and covers some very extreme scenarios and topics just like Tyler.  But, his lyrics are extraordinary and poetic beyond belief.  My favorite album of his is Gossamer and my favorite songs of his is, without a doubt, Where We Belong.   The Avett Brothers - Vast discography with every song being so beautifully written.  They sing a lot about love.  My favorite songs are Ballad of Love and Hate, Paranoia in B Flat Major, and Murder in the City.  (And like a thousand more of theirs.)   I strongly encourage you check out the four songs I listed, (just four, that's only like 20 mins!) and I think you may find that there are a couple other fantastic bands that can make a big difference in your life.  Take care, man."

The next day I searched for everything Twenty One Pilots on the internet and to this day, I havn't stopped. I still cry and think of my mom every time I hear Truce. My daughter and I have became a lot closer since she has become obsessed with Twenty One Pilots. I would love to win this poster and have it sent to her."

twentyonepilots,37gxyd,Nareshiyengar,3,Wed May 27 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"The first song I ever heard from twenty one pilots was Holding On To You and I have been a fan ever since. I couldn't stop listening to their songs and finding out more about Josh and Tyler. The more I 'got to know' them, the more I felt like they had been through shit as well as I still am. Their music was my kitchen sink, my reason to go on.   The beauty of them is that they don't tell you to just keep going and that ""everything'll be fine"", they don't shrug it off. The only thing they ask of you is to stay alive, to find your purpose and to pull through with them. They know we have problems and they and their music are here for us.  ""We are twenty one pilots and so are you."""

The only reason I know how to face it, though, is because of these two. Like many, we stumble upon these guys and we get dragged in by their gorgeous melodies and powerful drums. But like many others, Tyler's poetry is what hooks us in. I remember the day I saw the Holding on to You music video. The words and the music and the imagery in the video itself all clicked with me.   That was the first day I realized I was okay with my depression. I analyzed all of their lyrics after that, and realize that I wasn't alone anymore. Even if I didn't have friends, I had Tyler's words to fall back on. I try and learn every rap, sing every song, and blast it wherever I can, in hopes that someone struggling like I was will hear a bit of their music and feel the same way I did when I first heard it."

I am a college student searching for my purpose with only a few year left u told I go out into the ""real world"" and that is terrifying. Picking up TOP about a year ago was such a strange experience. Their story, their rise, and their passion have showed me that a local community will stand behind what they believe in. It makes me feel like if I want anything enough, there will be a group of people just as passionate who will be there to support me. Twenty one pilots has inspired me to create and pass on this exact feeling to as many people as I can. Because of this band, all I want to do is share the love of music they have ignited in me. The words, the music, the pain, all of it speaks to me and makes me feel things I never thought modern 2015 music could make me feel. It's refreshing and it's scary too. I'm just glad to be a part of a clique who knows exactly how this feels :) |-/"
twentyonepilots,37gxyd,guitargodmartin,2,Wed May 27 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"This is going to be my first time commenting on the sub, but I've been a lurker for a long time. I've wanted to express how this band and the clique has helped me, but I just never had the courage to really make a post. This seems like a good opportunity to get my feelings off my chest that I've wanted to for a while.   For five years, I've had Major Depressive Disorder. It hit me my junior year of high school, when my mother succumbed to her addiction. She didn't get out of bed for three months. My father is also an addict, so it was up to me to take care of her. Having to take care of her in a zombie-like state sort of triggered this disease that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I also have a strong genetic background with it, so instead of going away, my depression is like my shadow, clinging to me always and at times, consuming me.   My depression changed who I was. I started to almost feel like two people. The person I once was and knew I could be again, and the shell of the person that my depression made me. I pulled away from my friends emotionally. I kept everything inside. I refused to go to therapy or get medicated. I had it in my head that if I ever wanted to learn how to live with depression, I'd have to figure it out on my own. I kept my demons to myself (or tried). I woke up every day wishing I hadn't. I constantly thought about ending my life. Wouldn't it be better than living like I was?   If it weren't for my best friend, I never would have made it past that year. (This same friend is the Tyler to my Josh; we've now been friends for nearly eleven years, and she is the one that introduced me to tøp.)  Even as my mother got clean and went back to work, I still felt haunted as my life moved forward. Even as I started college and left the toxic household (for most of the year), everything I did was haunted by this fog. I physically couldn't enjoy the ""best years of my life"" because of my depression. But I got so used to this lowered happiness baseline, I thought that I was living an okay life.   Last year, my friend showed me this song ""Car Radio."" I loved it, and when I looked it up on YouTube later, I let the Playlist of their songs keep playing. I instantly connected with nearly all of their songs, with ""Migrane"" leaving me in awe with how much it represented the previous four years of my life, and ""Trees"" moving me to tears the first time I listened to it. I have never connected with music so passionately. I have never found words for the things I felt, for my demons.   Quickly, I realised that tøp's music was helping me gain a sense of self I hadn't had in years. For me, ""Holding Onto You"" isn't about a person or God. It's about holding onto myself. My depression makes me hate who I am, but listening to tøp makes me remember that I am not my disease. That there is a part of me that is who I really am, that can and will be happy again, that is so uniquely me and is important to this world. Not only does tøp make me realize  I'm not alone and that they care, this music gives me myself back. I can never thank Tyler and Josh enough for that.   It took a few months, but I decided to start going to therapy in October 2014. This was almost completely due to tøp and giving me the confidence that I can talk about these things in a way that will help me. This is also around the time I discovered the clique, and started reading everyone else's stories.   The amount of art I've saved from this community is... well, some might even call me ""obsessed."" I look at it whenever I start feeling down. It motivates me to get my work done, or go out and hang out with my friends, and be the person I know I can be. None of you may know me, but I know we're all connected by our passion for the band and what Tyler and Josh stand for.   Now, with the release of BLURRYFACE, I'm serious when I say I haven't listened to other music since (I probably should... haha). Its release has actually lined up with me beginning antidepressants. It's taken me a long time to admit I need serious help, and I wouldn't have gotten here without help from tøp and the clique. You all give me strength.   I implore you, if you're still reading this, if you need help, do not be afraid! The people in your life can surprise you in how supportive they can be. It's nice to meet all of you officially. Thank you for the help. Stay alive, my friends. |-/"

The feeling of hearing each song was surreal, Ode To Sleep reminded me of a song you'd play at a bonfire with your friends and you just flail your arms around while having a good time. Isle of Flightless Birds sounds like a song I'd want to play on vacation like in Norway just driving along the road and basking in the scenery.   Their songs give me the ability to apply my own imaginary happy scenarios to them. That's why I love Twenty one Pilots."

I've also dealt with an emotionally abusive father, and because of that I became very suicidal and lost interest in nearly everything. I found twenty one pilots during a super rough patch and their lyrics really spoke to me. Even though I'm fairly new to the clique, (coming in post-Vessel), the band means a lot to me, since they are a huge thing that has kept me holding on. Their songs make me feel O.K. about having mental illnesses and have been helping me recover by making me feel less alone in the world!   Thankfully, I am now far away from my dad and have been taking small steps to recovering and becoming more emotionally stable. And I have twenty one pilots to thank for helping me become stronger :D   I love them because their songs push people like me to become stronger and come to terms with living with anxiety and depression |-/"
twentyonepilots,37gxyd,NinjaBananaz,1 point,Wed May 27 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"Because they're just my all time favorite band.  Before listening to them I never really cared about anything, like I started just giving up on school, dodging every social thing to just sit inside and play League of Legends (don't start playing that game if you enjoy being happy btw) and generally being really mopey. But then I heard Guns for Hands on Pandora a while back and just became so curious with them, they sounded so unique. So of course I listened to Vessel and just instantly loved it (except Screen for some reason). I don't really understand why but I started actually acting confident, I tried to learn the ukulele and to sing (emphasis on tried), started going out way more, picked up drinking though. I'm guessing it's because a lot of the songs talk about fears and insecurities and thinking too much, and those are stuff that really affect me, even today. Now I'm not saying that I'm a social butterfly now, far from it, but I'm still milestones ahead of where I started because of them. And I am forever in their debt because they got me to actually go out and do something.   Stressed Out is probably my favorite song because it talks about how basically life is easier as a child and that's something that I'm actually worried about. I relate to this so much, like how I'm becoming an adult and about to enter some serious school related debt, not to mention my parents who keep on pressuring me to get a job.  On a side note, Forest probably helped me come to terms with the fact that I'm gay. For me the song was about escaping all your fears and hiding someplace  even though it's still there in the back of your head. I was raised with a sorta homophobic view, so when I started having those thoughts, I was so scared and tried desperately to hide them. But Forest made me realize that there is no use really. So now I'm coming out slowly but surely :)  So basically I love Twenty One Pilots |-/"

I was really depressed one day and started cutting. I then listened to the goner video, and I stopped. I stopped because I finally realized that people do care for the lives of others. Tyler and Josh both helped me get better. Though they weren't physically there, they were there in song. The lyrics from truce and lovely, such as""won't you stay alive?"" Really hit home.

twentyonepilots,37guhp,Groundedge,3,Wed May 27 18:35:55 2015 UTC,GA Row 9..not too bad! Thanks!

twentyonepilots,37guhp,aurynjounin,3,Wed May 27 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"I'm GA row 5 and was there @ 10:01!  apparently that doesn't matter though; /u/Captain_Murica91 posted HERE that the GA section wasn't going to have seats even though they are listed on the tickets. They are more of a place holder for the venue. It'll be first come first serve still.   Lets hope that isn't the case, even though it'll be way better if there aren't any seats in that area because of how unlit the concert is gonna be!"
twentyonepilots,37guhp,ConvolutedBoy,1 point,Wed May 27 19:01:44 2015 UTC,I believe the GA tickets are just first come first serve. They only put numbers on them for their own reference purposes.

twentyonepilots,37guhp,angelfromthecoast,1 point,Wed May 27 18:36:10 2015 UTC,This is specifically for the STL show which requires a presale code on Ticketmaster. It looks like tickets for the Seattle show aren't on sale yet (or at least there's no link on the website).

twentyonepilots,37fdas,lurkingmuffin,2,Thu May 28 01:36:11 2015 UTC,Awesome yeah even Tyler said in the interview that MCR was one of the bands that influenced him in a way in how they play their music.

If they wanted to release the album on FBR, then they would've already done it. Both the label and the band know we want to see the album released.  Also, I don't think its going to be worth releasing unless they redo every song on it that they haven't already. The album compared to what they make now is very unprofessional sounding."

twentyonepilots,37exs9,YovahnHoole,3,Wed May 27 04:25:11 2015 UTC,the only thing i've really heard them say are that the songs that were re-released on Vessel are what they really wanted heard and presented to a larger audience.
twentyonepilots,37exs9,LetsHaveTon,2,Wed May 27 04:28:41 2015 UTC,"Most of the songs from Regional at Best are on Vessel, so Fueled By Ramen didn't want the band to sell the album."

""Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breath fine and tie it to a tree, tell it your belong to me. This ain't a noose it is a leash and I have news for you, you must obey me.""

twentyonepilots,37bmmj,The_DILinator,7,Tue May 26 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the authors interpretation of Ride. ""I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride"" to me means that he's dying, but he's gonna take his time doing it and enjoy the ride.  This same motif of falling has been seen in earlier twenty one pilots songs as well. ""I don't want to fall away"" (Fall Away)  shows that Tyler doesn't want to die. Also, in Air Catcher: ""I won't fall I love with falling"" shows that Tyler somewhat enjoys falling toward his death, because he's not happy with his own life. However, he won't allow himself to be content with just dying and doing nothing about it.  Of course, this is all my interpretation, but it makes sense to me. There are actually so many motifs and reoccurring themes in twenty one pilots it's not even funny. I'd like to take time and really delve into these lyrics sometime. Find connections and stuff."
twentyonepilots,37bmmj,GoodnightTwinkletoes,2,Tue May 26 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"One could argue that both interpretations are the same thing to a Christian believer, as spiritual death is the same as falling away from God"

I also think the Air Catcher interpretation about death seems to make sense as well.  I feel reasonably certain, however, Fall Away refers to falling away from God/his faith, or at least what God wants for him, not death.  I can see where one could interpret it that way, however."

It was never about selling singles, ""defying genres"", or sticking it to the music industry. It's about the eternal, universal struggle of the human experience, and it does it oh so beautifully :)"
twentyonepilots,3792lt,kdawg0707,5,Tue May 26 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"You really said it well. I'm pretty tired of reviews emphasizing the album's ""rebellious"" nature as if it's what it's all about. And the genre hopping isn't some kind of gimmick, it's part of who twenty one pilots is as a band. The message is the real core of the album, and most of the ""mainstream"" reviewers barely mention that part of it at all, often ignoring it completely."
twentyonepilots,3792lt,micahjahns,11,Tue May 26 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"The last paragraph especially got to me. I've been an atheist for quite a few years now, but recently, this band's music has really been getting me thinking about faith and spirituality a lot more. Tyler's words have shown me  a lighter, hopeful side of God and religion that I was never previously exposed to."
twentyonepilots,3792lt,sharkifyification,8,Tue May 26 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear!  We Christians often refer to the Gospel - the foundation for our beliefs - as The Good News, which is really what it is!  The fact that so many have clouded that with so much negativity, doom and gloom, and ""bad news"", is unfortunate...  It's great TOP have exposed you to the other, more ""in tune"" side of the Christian spectrum!  I hope they can continue to aid you in your search for the Truth!  :)"
twentyonepilots,3792lt,The_DILinator,2,Tue May 26 12:46:49 2015 UTC,"Same here. I have my qualms with Christianity, but I can relate to appealing to a higher power for help and guidance."
twentyonepilots,3792lt,seasickagain,6,Wed May 27 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"See, reviews like this, that actually take the message of the album into consideration along with the other qualities, really reach into the core of twenty one pilots and give the album a lot of praise as a result. Your average media outlet review makes little to no attempt at looking deeper into the album, barely glazes over the themes, and tends to only care about aesthetics. As a result, they give the album pretty average/mediocre reviews. I think that if you take twenty one pilots completely on the surface, without even taking the time to contemplate or sympathize with their meaning, you aren't going to enjoy them nearly as much. All you hear is a frenzy of different genres with some schizophrenic personality (which actually is part of the picture, but only just that: part). When you look into the lyrics and find all of those little details and connections, you find hope and satisfaction. I don't think any review can do Blurryface justice unless you take all these things into account. It goes deeper than most music by being an experience that causes the listener to examine who they are, what they believe in, and what they can do to fight their own inner demons."
twentyonepilots,3792lt,micahjahns,3,Tue May 26 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think you've touched on the ""mystical"" component of the music that I alluded to in my review on my blog, and Amazon.  The fact that, as Tyler said in Message Man, ""Only few understand.""  Most negative reviewers clearly didn't connect with the music on a deeper, and more emotional/spiritual/philisopical level, critiquing it as they would any other artist's work.  But I really think TOP operates on a different level than most, if not all other artists, where it's really a 4D rather than 3D or 2D experience.  I don't know how to explain it more...  Either people get it, or they don't."
twentyonepilots,3792lt,The_DILinator,6,Tue May 26 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"Best review I've read yet. So well thought out.

They worked really hard to impress their audiences since day one on a small scale, but they've always imagined something huge.  I think that confidence is tangible for critics, fans, and new listeners alike to feel.  In the taped Korea show ""EBS"" they joked that their main scheme was to take over the world one day.  In their music video for Ode to Sleep, they show very little signs of stopping."

twentyonepilots,377p63,cadigan90,11,Mon May 25 15:44:28 2015 UTC,TL;DR doubt is possibly about Tyler doubting God.
twentyonepilots,377p63,drewuke,3,Mon May 25 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yes and No.   Yes, Doubt is clearly Tyler voicing some of his doubts about God, and His ways, and how Tyler fits into all that.  Yes, he references questioning the established religious leaders' guidance, and the overall ""deadness"" of modern day Christianity.    No, Tyler isn't saying he's doubting in God's existence, and any amount of personal context to the album (for instance the Thank You's on the album) makes it abundantly clear that Tyler (and Josh) both have very firm and clear beliefs in the existence of God, as well as their beliefs about Him.    So, I think you're generally right, though I think to question where Tyler and Josh's faith currently lies (which I see people do around here from time to time) is off-base, based on all context evidenced in their personal lives.    Somebody else here mentioned something regarding their faith, that I found to be very telling.  It was that it is heavily based on the teachings and philosophies of the existentialist philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.  Looking into his philosophies deeper, you find that Kierkegaard regarded doubt as an essential component of a true and strong faith.  You see that influence reflected often in TOP's works, as his philosophy discussed the importance of working through one's faith and doubt with intelligence and thought process.  If that doesn't sound like TOP's lyrical themes frequently, I don't know what does!    At any rate, I just thought I'd share, since it seemed relevant to your post.  FWIW, I am a devout Christian myself, and really connected with the song Doubt as well.  I too believe working through one's faith intellectually is a key component of a believer's  walk with the Lord, and doubt certainly plays a role in that from time to time.  I really dig the sound of the song too, surprisingly!  Thanks for sharing!"
twentyonepilots,377p63,The_DILinator,2,Mon May 25 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I picked up on too. Basically I feel like Doubt is more of Tyler pleading to God to remember him in his suffering even when he has his doubts because he says quote ""I'm no good without you"""
twentyonepilots,377p63,open-aperture96,2,Mon May 25 20:57:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly!  I find it to be a very honest and emotional plea to reaffirm his faith.  We all feel the doubts from time to time as we go through life.  I think Tyler is of the belief - and I agree with him - that to simply accept everything at face value without questioning or occasional doubt is a sign of a faith that is dead - because to think is to be alive, as he has said previously."
twentyonepilots,377p63,The_DILinator,3,Mon May 25 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"I also think it's interesting that the artwork associated with ""Doubt"" is  what appears to be cracked, dry earth.  Really fits in with the concept of being parched for some of that ""water"" from God that Tyler sings about a number of times in various other songs!"

I couldn't agree with your post any more. It really addresses a topic that a lot of people in the faith struggle with. If you're interested in exploring doubt and Christianity more, the book Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller is series of auto-biographical stories the illustrate the concepts very well.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts and story with us."

Hence the line ""I wish I had two faces to prove which theory works, yelling from the street corner or cleverly masking your words.""

The whole ""my name's Blurryface and I care what you think"" part seems too ""creepy""/""alternative"" for the song as a whole to beat out Heavydirtysoul, Tear in My Heart, AND The Judge for most popular single on the album.   But as for the whole having 4 tracks from the album in the US Viral 50 playlist, I'm not surprised at all because about half of the songs on the album make great radio singles!   I would change it though so there's 5 singles and they rank as follows...  1) Heavydirtysoul 2) The Judge 3) Tear in My Heart 4) Not Today  5) Stressed Out"

twentyonepilots,375daj,tdonick,3,Mon May 25 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"Kitchen sink is my favorite song on RaB.   To me, a kitchen sink is your current place of emotion. It's where you are in your mind. Are you okay? Are you dealing with demons? The greatest part is the fact the lyrics place those ideas on to you: ""No one else is dealing with your demons Meaning, maybe, defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend.""     Conquering your inner ""demons"" and figuring out your life is what a kitchen sink to me is."

twentyonepilots,375daj,TransPM,1 point,Mon May 25 01:53:29 2015 UTC,"I think of the expression ""everything but/and the kitchen sink"", an I imagine those times in my life when I feel so overwhelmed, stressed, and just worn out from fighting to hold it all in. The ""Kitchen sink"", to me, is that last thing that sets you over the edge, that you can't possibly hold inside with everything else, and the thing that causes everything else you've been holding back to flood out of you all at once. Its the ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" in terms of emotional breakdowns.  Maybe its also because my own literal kitchen sink is often filled to the brim/overflowing with dishes.  I know Tyler has said that its something very personal to him, stemming from an impactful moment in his life that happened while he was standing at a literal kitchen sink. So the song also reminds me of a similar moment in my life where I was curled in a ball, on the floor, crying, listening to TØP (Car Radio specifically), ironically all while huddled underneath a hotel room sink. That night was both a long fall into my darker side, and a big step forward for me, and I credit TØP's music for giving me the strength to act as I did in that moment."
