cringe,3e043z,Deviant_Fart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"My theory: feminists sought out feminist ideology in the first place because they feel insecure; the dynamic here is identical to males who go out of their way to avoid looking effeminate. These are people who lack confidence in themselves because at some point in their lives (probably as young children) they got it in their heads that, in order to ""succeed"" or be seen as valuable people, they have to be ""strong"", which typically entails pleasing some un-pleasable parent-figure psychological entity (I know... psychobabble. I'm sorry). This lack of confidence also makes them feel as though they have no control over their own lives. This makes them frightened, lonely people who can never, ever admit to being so. Their response is to try and control others, or at least control others' perception of them. The Internet allows them to accomplish this by isolating themselves amongst others who share a similar worldview. In this way, they prevent themselves from ever growing as people, whilst spiraling into progressively greater degrees of unhappiness, which as you may guess has the effect of enhancing the problem even further. Since that community/worldview now defines their social circle, they develop a warped concept of friendship revolving around how ideologically similar you are to the guy next to you. It is also why they defend that worldview with such vitriol: it has become a major source of their identity as people, and any attack on their ideas is therefore perceived, albeit subconsciously, as an attack on their very persona. It's sad, really: you threaten them simply because you are you, and they are not.  Of course, you probably already figured most of this out yourselves."

So they know that the surveillance phase (in which a potential terrorist will observe and often film government buildings) is one of the best opportunities to detect and stop an attack before it happens.   So the agents are on their way to work and see something that's potentially indicative of a violent plot, shouldn't they at least stop and see what he's doing? No one's stopping him and he certainly wasn't arrested- you just had people that were trained on what to look for that wanted to know what was going on around their workplace.

There are no laws preventing it, it's just an issue of creating a problem for someone (i.e. ruining his life publicly) without evidence. In this case, though, not only did they have him on camera, not only did they have documented evidence of a repeated history of him being an issue (in the story, interviews indicated that he'd been doing this in the past and had recently returned to do it again,) but in the interview he participated in himself, he admitted to it when confronted. He'd already given them his name, at that point, it was too late.   Would MOST stations refrain from airing his name/face?

I get that he was masturbating near the children's section, but that doesn't make him a predator - just dumb.

It as really hard for our coaches to teach people who should be defensive backs to play any position they weren't quite big enough to play.  Our offensive line was not good considering we only had one big body in a team full of seniors.

cringe,3dutxj,thenakedbarrister,5,Sun Jul 19 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"Some of those examples go to mistakes made inside the game, which have a direct bearing on someone's skills. Celebrating too early is a mistake outside of the game and doesn't have anything to do with someone's skills. Can we really say that the guy in blue is better at the game than the guy in red, knowing that the guy in red's mistake didn't have anything to do with the game? I can see your argument, but I wouldn't be happy with this victory if I were blue."
cringe,3dutxj,LikeAGregJennings,12,Sun Jul 19 22:26:35 2015 UTC,I'd say lack of awareness of what round you're in has a lot to do with the game. It's a pretty fundamental aspect.

You train all year and then need to beat out hundreds of people for these spots. This was top 8 so every win is huge weather you beat an afk guy or a small child.

Because forgetting the title and team name of the broadcast you are being paid to host is an acceptable thing.   These gaming tournaments are the most esoteric things on the planet   One of which was broadcasted on ESPN2...  Esoteric - intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest. (For people like me who had to look that up)   have such a focused audience.   Because people invested in the program they like to watch shouldn't pay attention. Furthermore, I've hosted parties in which an esports game was going on in the background and we weren't really paying attention to the game, I don't really see the point in bringing that up as it only (incorrectly) describes esports instead of focusing on the subject aka the host   They're not going to find a host that gives a shit about the event at all. And I don't see any of the Gamers stepping up to host.   Anders, Semmler, Moses, ddk, jzfb, Producer Reece, Thoorin, Megaman, the list goes on. Furthermore, if you're paying someone to host a broadcast, no matter what it may be, you would expect them to at least know the damn title.

Only one I can remember that stuck out was armed security personnel had to be between he and ""all angles of approach from the seating area."" The organizers refused, because state laws limited how many campus police could be present (paid, was the primary concern) when metal detectors and entry security was deployed. He wasn't going to perform, but one of the band members did something to smooth things over, I was told. It was just bizarre.

During a March 1960 practice run in Texas, he lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. Although momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact, he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam ten feet to the surface, escaping without major injuries. He graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi in May 1960. He joined squadron VA-42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of further training on the Skyraider.  ... His aviation skills improved, but around December 1961 he collided with power lines while recklessly flying too low over southern Spain. The area suffered a power outage, but McCain was able to return his damaged Skyraider to Intrepid.  ... In November 1965, he had his third accident when apparent engine failure in his T-2 Buckeye trainer jet over the Eastern Shore of Virginia led to his ejecting safely before his plane crashed."
cringe,3dsbcn,squidpantiesdeux,30,Sun Jul 19 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"That's a selective reading of his prowess in the military.  From another section:   McCain was almost killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. While the air wing was preparing to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck.[85] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it.[80] The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose.[86] McCain later said, ""I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere.""[80] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out the cockpit, working himself to the nose of the jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck.[86] His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out.[86]   He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters)[87] and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments.[62][80][88] McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestal's ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television.[89] The fire killed 134 sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20 aircraft, and took 24 hours to control.[80][90][91] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck.   Shit he went through sounds pretty wild to me.  Here's another bit about what happened after his plan was shot while on a bombing run:   McCain's plane went into a vertical inverted spin.[110] Bailing out upside down at high speed,[111] the force of the ejection fractured McCain's right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious.[111][112] McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms.[105] Eventually, he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth.[105]   I mean I don't like McCain's politics much, but it seems disingenuous to call him a ""shitty soldier"" like /u/pssst--itsthepope did."

cringe,3dsbcn,vadkert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"The salient point isn't that far off base, Trump is just very abrasive, and whenever someone sees him speaking, there's a lot of psychological baggage that comes with it. And to an extent, Trump thrives on that relationship. When people expect him to say inflammatory or obnoxious things, he only has to be 50% as inflammatory or obnoxious in order to get attention, which I believe is his ultimate end game.  Trump essentially says that McCain is regarded as a war hero simply because he was captured. The extension of that thought is that heroism is not tied to circumstances to such a degree that simply being captured bestows upon someone the title of 'hero.' How someone carries themselves in such a situation, how they persevere may make them heroic (and you can make an argument that McCain's conduct was heroic) but the idea of a prisoner of war is held as kind of a direct route to heroism, in much the same way that a lot of popular media carries the narrative of ANY military service being heroic.  Where Trump steps in it is when he says 'I like people who don't get captured' which would imply it was some degree of weakness that leads to a soldier being captured. Whether Trump intends to mean that a strong, real, or 'heroic' soldier wouldn't be put in a position to be captured because a strong/real/heroic soldier would invariably best his enemies in combat, because of American exceptionalism blah blah blah; OR if Trump is saying that a strong/real/heroic soldier would sooner be killed than captured is not clear, and the fact that it's not clear doesn't muddy the issue here.   Trump has drawn a line through a list of military veterans, whereas the popular narrative is that any American who serves in the military is inherently heroic and brave and an ideal of American virtues (save for war criminals, etc.) and in Trump's world, only certain people are heroes, and being in the military (or being captured in war) doesn't meet the threshold for heroism all on it's own. I don't disagree with that.   Now, I don't know if Trump necessarily believes these things, or is adopting this position in order to detract from the forcefield around a political opponent. A person's heroic veteran status is typically off limits. If I had to guess, based on my limited knowledge, I would guess that Trump stepped over an unspoken line in order to discredit an opponent because stepping over unspoken lines is kind of his MO. Then he had to sprinkle in his 'I like people who don't get captured' extra inflammatory bit so people would actually pay more attention to him. Trump believes that so long as people are talking about him, he's winning, and with the way the media-politic relationship is set up, and the way party affiliation, candidate loyalty, and elections work in the United States, I don't know if I think he's necessarily being unwise by reaching that conclusion."

What he said is that capture is inherently dishonorable, and the fact that McCain was captured means that he was not a hero. That's a shitty and stupid thing to say."

Maybe he didn't make Seinfeld famous, but the soup nazi episode is surely one of the most iconic.

The man answers with a smoky and trembling voice and a Scottish accent:  Ah, tell ya man! This pub, this very pub we're just sitting in. I built it, with me own hands! But do they call me the Pubmaker? Naa! See the wall over there, that protects our town? I built it, with me own hands! But do they call me the Wallmaker? And the bridge, you know, that crosses our river, I built it, with me own hands! But do they call me the Bridgemaker?  But I tell ya, man! YOU FUCK ONE GOAT!""  No wonder the guy is pissed. The fact that people here miss the obvious problem is quite a characteristic of our society and, to extent, capitalism in general.

I understand that this was a successful business long before 'Seinfeld' but I don't believe there's anyway CNN would care about this guy's decision to franchise if it couldn't be tied into something larger, IE: Seinfeld. It at most would have been a local news human interest bit. 'Hey Joe's Burgers is franchising throughout the country."" Etc.   If you want to distance yourself from some element of your career or identity, there are plenty of good reasons to do it, but part of that is also giving up on the benefits you may have received by nature of those elements of your career or identity. It's like when adult film actors move into other careers and want to disassociate from their pornographic past. But they still use the stage names they had when they were in the industry. A pseudonym ostensibly created to shield the quote 'real' person from being negatively associated with pornography, and they hold onto it (because it made them famous) and want to be taken seriously as actors, artists, musicians, etc."

You can still post as normal, but nobody except yourself will be able to see it and you'll just feel ignored. It was originally intended as a way to combat bots, but it's since been used vs. normal users for a wide variety of things not related to spam. Recently with the CEO change, the new CEO claimed that they will refrain from using it on normal users and only target bots with shadow bans, but there's since still been users targeted with shadow bans."

If somebody comes out wearing a shirt with the German flag on it, people would avoid them and think quietly to themselves ""lol"". Same is true in most other places, just not America for some reason.  There's plenty of good people here who subscribe to this view that one country is better than others because that is the country they were born in. That's not true and it's a dangerous way to think.

He's noticeably up above everyone else if you watch it again.   Normally the cameras who would get the ""reaction"" crowd shots would be in the front shooting back, but this looks like a pretty boring show where it's just a DJ standing up there playing stuff. I imagine the director told one camera to stay on the stage and told everyone else to just look for people dancing that they could cut to."

cringe,3dlqrh,WhyWouldHeLie,2,Fri Jul 17 23:57:18 2015 UTC,Really depends on context. At least at club shows and festivals(which this looks to be) there is ALWAYS a few people hired by the promotion agency to take pictures and video in the crowd and go around and take pictures of the people at the event. The only way to do this is to go into the crowd and protect the hell out of your camera.

cringe,3dlqrh,KiNGWiZARD_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"Haha not really (on the math knowledge part). The easiest way in is to have connections, but without connections you COULD go to college for broadcasting/communications (which I did), but I wouldn't recommend that either.   I would recommend trying to get jobs as a production assistant to start out. You can apply for these on craigslist or there's a site called staffmeup.com that's really good for it. Day rate for production assistants is usually $125/day and you're basically just there to do all the stuff that sucks (unloading production trucks, running cables, going on coffee runs, stuff like that). You don't really need a work history in TV to get these jobs either. I was a broadcasting major who had already been working at a local TV station for a year and I got my first production assistant job because I had worked at a furniture delivery place years before that. They just wanted someone they could trust to drive, as crazy as that is.   Start out as a production assistant, be nice to everyone on set and especially take interest in the camera department. Keep hustling and eventually something will come up and you'll get lucky and be moved up to Assistant Camera. Once you get to that point, you're basically in.   Sorry for the long response.   TLDR: Staffmeup.com -> apply for production assistant jobs -> be nice/helpful."

cringe,3dlqrh,WhyWouldHeLie,4,Sat Jul 18 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"That's worse.  The best to do is to try and divert your eyes just past them when you notice them starting to notice.  Once you feel their intimidating stare heating up the light bouncing off of you, briefly make eye contact, and nod your head.  -OR-  Hold eye contact as long as possible, and within a few seconds flair your nostrils and pound your chest like the mighty Silverback Gorilla.  They will be either be super turned on or might leave because they fear you will rape them.  Either way it a win. This technique works for both genders, btw."

cringe,3dlqrh,Andrewticus04,65,Fri Jul 17 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I work in TV so maybe I can explain this to some of you.  In TV production, you have lots of moving parts - namely the cameramen (as the casual observer sees), a switcher, and a director.  The director's job is to make the show look like a presentation - not a million angles of the same person on stage. This involves getting reaction shots, wide shots, tight shots on girls going ""WOOOO"" and all that shit you casual observers take for granted. So the call is made over comms to cameramen x y and z to get shots of the stage (x), the Goodyear blimp (y), and ""that pretty girl dancing in front of you"" (z).   Now, from the perspective of cameraman z, he's just sitting there on the girl waiting for his cue to move. You people all see his footage, which isn't going live, and think this is just some dude creeping.   You clearly have no idea why he's paused there, but you're fast to claim he's a perv - WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF ITS A MALE CAMERAMAN - all of which is a disgusting display of sexism and childish judgment of that which you do not understand.  Ennehweigh...  From cameraman z's perspective, he was told to look at the crowd for reaction shots, and hold for his cue. This is what he's hearing:  His director:  ""Take from talent cam to X cam. Hold on the stage. Now take X to talent. Hold on talent. Now take talent to Y. Hold on the Goodyear blimp. Now take Y to talent. Hold on the talent. Now take talent to Z....OHSHIT chick is breaking the fourth wall, get off her!!!""  And you guys see this one bit of a giant production and go ""RAPIST!!! OBVS A GUY BECAUSE GUYS ONLY WANT TO OBJECTIFY WYMINZ!!!"""

cringe,3dlqrh,SerjoHlaaluDramBero,13,Fri Jul 17 14:17:27 2015 UTC,I don't get it.  The cringe is when she completely stops dancing and stares straight into the camera.  The cameraperson finally decides this shit is too ruined even for B-roll and tries to find someone else in the crowd who looks like they're having fun.  The only detectable cringe is from ol' girl's shitty dance moves and her putting a dead-stop on filming instead of just rolling with it so they can come away with a decent promo vid for next year.  Instead she gets so self-conscious she locks up and (presumably) wets herself.  Weak cringe.

So one of our diplomat went to discuss a deal with Qatar Airways. He was upgraded for free to first class (so a small suite in the plane) and all the like.  When it came to having dinner with the high-ranking people of the company, the most exquisite food was served. There was food made fresh that day, flown from France. There were wild truffles, harvested the same day, also flown in. Overall, a very expensive, high-end, meal. Something in the multiple thousands. It was an extremely extravagant meal. Luxurious things abounded.  On the day after, it was the diplomat's turn to organise a meal.  He was given by the department a budget of $50 per person.

So the system gave me two options, ""newsreader - local station"" or ""newsreader - national station"".    Me being me, socially awkward and not familiar with TV, I said ""local station or national?"" to which she replied ""I'm Kay Burley"". Me? ""Umm, ok, so... local or national?""

But in this case, Hitch had referenced a leader's belief that he was going to see Revelation in his lifetime, and his actions were ""divinely inspired"", etc. And Bill pointed out that President Bush had asserted the very same beliefs regarding his actions in the middle east, specifically during Israel negotiations.  In this particular instance, it was relevant and valid rebuttal, but sadly that point was muddied by the audience's hooting and hollering (on this point, I will agree with Hitch)."

You sound like an utter toolbag.""  He didn't get much of a response from the other people on the panel, and he honestly acted like that was some sort of validation that he was the reigning expert on the matter. They were smirking, and I totally agreed with their silent contempt.  PS. Krugman was easily the smartest guy in the room. I think more people would listen to him if he had a personality that didn't border on Aspergers."

Freaks me out that people feel the need to lock all their choices into one political party or label such as ""conservative"" or ""liberal."" I'm getting off on a tangent, but who the fuck cares? What does it mean to be ""conservative?"" Words like that have lost all meaning anymore. Now conservative, to the general public, simply means an association with the stereotypes of a republican as ""liberals"" are to Democrats. This isn't a team sport. It's human issues.  Put simply, if I hear someone designate their political affiliation to begin a discussion, I stop listening."

They put their platforms through focus groups to see which views give them the best chances of being elected (among other things). Just because they say things during their campaigns does not mean they will do it during their term in office (this can be a good or a bad thing).

cringe,3dlodn,LondonCallingYou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:06 2015 UTC,As someone who actually likes George W Bush   Why? If you don't mind me asking.
cringe,3dlodn,NickMoore30,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mind you asking, but my answer may not be as grounded in logic as you'd prefer. I'm a Texan, and so obviously I was familiar with Bush when I was younger. I grew up in a family of Republicans and always obtained information in that perspective.   When Bush was in office I was 12-19 years old. He was the president during my development into adulthood, and frankly I just really liked his personality. Every time he spoke a lot of people would give him gripe over his made-up words, and rightfully so. However, to me I thought that was very human. He seemed very human to me, I never saw the perspective that people saw him as evil. Now I can understand where that view came from considering the situation with 9/11.   However, he was always used as a scapegoat for the issues throughout his presidency. I think the reality of the president is probably pretty ironic in that the most powerful position has no power at all. I say that because I think a president has so many people to appease and answer to, there's very little room for independent action. That's also why I feel presidential candidates' promises to always be so meritless.  But you asked about Bush.   Like I was saying, he was attacked on all fronts for his decisions on matters but he never diverted blame. He took it on the chin, and among other things I think that's pretty admirable. I'm a proponent that the government shouldn't be a proponent of any religion, hell it's in the establishment clause, but I DID like the way Bush handled religion. Not all the time, somethings he said were a little too: ""our religion is Christian and we believe in God,"" but as a Christian myself I shamelessly liked how his religious values seemed to genuinely be a part of his consciousness (obviously the actions in war can be a solid counter-argument to this point).  Lastly, he did get us into war, but he definitely owned that responsibility. He was always visiting the troops and checking in on injured soldiers. He showed a lot of concern and care for our soldiers. It was real, before ""support the troops"" became this cheap slogan for claps. Almost in the same vein that a comedian says, ""I love this city.""  So, that's my answer. I don't pretend that's perfect. I know a large portion of it is developed from more of a liking for his personality and persona. He was on Leno after his presidency, and during a time when Obama was taking some heat. Leno asked him about his thoughts and Bush said, ""I don't believe a former president should ever comment on or offer advice to  a sitting president."" He meant that out of respect, and I thought that was pretty remarkable. Here's the guy who had been a human piñata for all of America's failures for the past 3-4 years, and he's offered this chance to take a shot in a safe place such as a talk show, and he took the high road. I see Bush and I see a decent human being that probably was a little overwhelmed with his role as president."

cringe,3dkiau,Heifsin85,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:15:23 2015 UTC,Especially the word in the title of the song
cringe,3dkiau,carismo,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"1) She's on TV. 2) I assume she's pretty famous, since, you know, TV.  3) The song is called ""Chandelier"". How the hell do you learn a song and not know how to pronounce the one word for which the song is named?"

cringe,3dkiau,Pure-Vinyl,10,Sat Jul 18 22:12:49 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't find anything cringey about this. Is she the best singer? no but it definitely wasn't bad. Did she use all the correct lyrics? no clue. This is literally a video of someone just singing a song and I guess the fact that shes not an A list celeb with the voice of an angel makes it cringe worthy.
cringe,3dkiau,clutch172,4,Sun Jul 19 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i agree"
cringe,3dkiau,btpirate,2,Fri Jul 17 06:32:29 2015 UTC,She isn't even English. So chandelier probably translates weird and the audience doesn't even know.
cringe,3dkiau,SelfimmolationPride,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:24:06 2015 UTC,"no one's cringing at her ability, but at the fact that she's singing a song on television and didn't even bother to find out how all the words are pronounced.

That first time she said ""chandaliry"" my insides twisted, she pronounced it better the next few times. Also is she performing for a non English speaking crowd? If so that .ight make it a bit less cringey."
cringe,3dkiau,SkysDlim,8,Fri Jul 17 03:10:17 2015 UTC,She really doesn't; half the time she was out of tune
cringe,3dkiau,toastedipod,-7,Fri Jul 17 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Your voice can't be out of tune lol.  I think you're trying to say she was sharp or flat, but I don't really hear it.  The cello sounds a little off around 1:37, I didn't notice any other big slip-ups after the mark where OP started.  She actually has a couple really cool embellishments later in the song."
cringe,3dkiau,Dixnorkel,6,Fri Jul 17 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"Your voice can't be out of tune   Saying the phrase ""he/she is singing out of tune"" is just another way of saying someone is singing out of key.    I think you're trying to say she was sharp or flat, but I don't really hear it.   Off the top of my head when she sang ""I'm"", Chandelier, night, and then when she did that little run at 1:39 she was off again.  Not at all a terrible singer, she is definitely good. Just this was a sloppy performance."
cringe,3dkiau,AnArcticTaco,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:56 2015 UTC,"My mistake, I thought since you were critiquing music that you would be using the terminology properly.  I don't really agree that it's a ""sloppy"" performance, the lady is a cover artist and it's hard to do those embellishments full-voiced without feeling pretty secure in the note you're hitting."

cringe,3dl94x,rappersdo,26,Fri Jul 17 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's such bullshit that dodging like that is even acceptable on certain platforms.  I wish it was possible for the interviewer to just say straight up, ""I'm going to give you one opportunity to clearly hear my question, and legitimately answer, or this interview will be finished.""  And then when they start vomiting forth that kind of pre-written hot garbage he just interrupts and says, ""Alright, Ladies and Gentlemen, that's all we have time for, good evening.""  Why even give them the chance to say anything if they very clearly aren't going to be open and honest."

cringe,3dl94x,psycheduck,18,Sat Jul 18 10:02:39 2015 UTC,"This is famous here in the UK. Michael Howard later went on to be leader of the Conservative Party, but this interview dogged him and he didn't last long. From what I remember the issue was that Howard wanted to dismiss the governor of a prison, but the director of the prison service disagreed; and Howard didn't have the legal authority to overrule him, so instead he dismissed the director of the prison service instead.  Apparently Paxman was asked to fill time because the next segment wasn't ready - Howard obviously wasn't expecting him to keep at it. He doesn't answer because (a) he didn't want to appear weak (b) his actions came across as heavy-handed (c) he was naturally evasive.  Paxman's other famous demolition from roughly the same period was of Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; shortly after Lamont ballsed-up Britain's participation in the European exchange rate mechanism Paxman asked him if he enjoyed being Chancellor. Lamont's reply was ""why, yes"", at which point Paxman said ""are you going to miss it then?"" It was doubly funny because Lamont looked genuinely offended."

cringe,3dl6qb,BILLCLINTONMASK,3,Fri Jul 17 06:09:36 2015 UTC,Dog said she knows the region better than the other candidates so far. He is correct.   About Iraqi sanctions: Saddam was certainly killing his own people en masse. He has chemical/bio weapons and wasn't letting the weapons inspectors have unfettered access. The sanctions had international support.   About the Iran deal: You must be joking when you say she is against the Iran deal. This deal is part of her legacy. She helped craft it. She had a lead role in the negotiations before Kerry came in.  About Assad:  Sec of state job is largely to support administration policies. The administration took an aggressive stance against Assad  as they should have. But at this time we don't know how Clinton actually felt or how she would have approached the problem as president.

She was obviously uncomfortable, and her body language was not at all that of someone ""snuggling"" against another person. Any part of her body that was free to move was pulled away from him as far as possible.  More than that, making a joke is not an invitation to be sexually assaulted.  The fact that you don't understand this means you're either extremely ignorant of healthy sexual relationships or you think this is sexually healthy behavior.  If it's the former, you just need open experience. If it's the latter, you should probably check yourself before you end up ruining lives.  edit: if you bothered to read what she said about the incident, she was caught between kneeing him in the crotch or doing her job. Neither of which are her being okay with this behavior."

Robin Williams to his credit shelled out plenty of cash when comics complained of his inadvertent theft (Robin would do a lot of coke and in his manic style repeat things he heard other comics do.

An example I can remember off the top of my head was a joke that I first heard by Jim Jeffries where the punchline was ""what do you mean homosexuals aren't tough? They Fuck men!"" Different comic, same punchline but it was still not the same joke because he set it up in an entirely different way with a different delivery.

If someone knows what it was, could you tell me? I'd like to hear it again. I'm pretty sure it was the chorus to a hip-hop song. A relatively newer one too (probably this year).   My problem with what D1 did is that he wasn't confident about it. His voice waivered, and that's what made it bad. If he had been confident about it, I think his breathing wouldn't have been all erratic, his voice stronger, and the reaction better. At that point, it really was cringey, but I don't think it was because he made the decision to do what he did... it was just because he didn't execute it well."

cringe,3daw1k,JayString,21,Wed Jul 15 13:03:15 2015 UTC,Cameramen and a director doesn't mean something has a script and people are reading lines from it.  Reality TV is partly so popular because it's easy to make because they don't need a script and don't need to nail lines. They manufacture the weird situation and then let the maniacs loose to interact with it and film it and edit it into the best bits.

For example, Anthony Jeselnik is an asshole ON STAGE, but is widely regarded as a great guy offstage. Gabriel Iglesias is a guy who is even a nice guy on stage and is regarded as a really nice guy off. Ralphie May, Ted Alejandro, Maria Bamford, Jim Florentine, Greg Fitzsimmons, Jim Gaffigan, George Carlin, Zach Galifianakis, Todd Glass, Jimmy Carr, Stephen Lynch, Kumail, Tig Notaro, Patton Oswalt, I could go on and on.

cringe,3d9zsw,Studawg1,31,Tue Jul 14 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna pop an explanation under here since it seems the appropriate spot.  The underground railroad was the network of paths and people that would lead slaves escaping from the American south (where slavery was legal) to the north (where it was not).  It was called underground because it had to be hidden, because obviously slavery was legal, so an escaped slave was considered lost  or stolen property and as such was legally required to be returned to the ""rightful"" owner if found, and anyone helping them escape would be prosecuted as legally appropriate. Note that some northern states did not require escaped slaves be returned if found, as they did not legally recognize slavery. Others (particularly border states) would still consider escaped slaves their owners property, even though slavery was not permitted within that state (because obviously the slave and owner came from out of state, so those states did recognize the other states' allowance of slavery as legitimate).  It was called a railroad as a euphemism. The modern equivalent would be highway. Like how an uptight preacher might say some teenagers listening to rock music are on the ""highway to Hell,"" but there is not actually a highway that goes to Hell. Same thing here."
cringe,3d9zsw,Zarokima,5,Tue Jul 14 22:42:06 2015 UTC,Euphemism: a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassi

When I was a child I was told, and believed that banshees were real. For the next forty or fifty years I have not discussed banshees.

At least in the sense that there is a relatively low barrier of entry to being a DJ. You just have to buy equipment and market yourself. Many (most?) of the people who will be booking DJs aren't DJs themselves, so there isn't going to be a great deal of savvy in weeding out the crappy participants.  I don't think performing at a high level in any field requires no (or 'virtually no') effort or skill, but there are some career moves that are easier to jump into than others. If this title was 'Jon Gosselin is now a physician' I would have a lot more curiosity about how he got to that stage than I do about him DJing."
cringe,3dajd8,vadkert,9,Wed Jul 15 11:28:01 2015 UTC,"The difference between hiring a shitty band and hiring a shitty DJ is that it isn't so obvious when a DJ is bad, especially to people who aren't really into dance music. As long as there's music coming out of the speakers and there's someone standing at a laptop it seems like DJ'ing.    I'm just gonna go on a little rant here because I hear the following comment a lot and it shits me to tears. I agree that there is a very low barrier of entry to DJ'ing for the reason I gave above, so this is not directed at you .  ""Oh but with the software these days they don't even have to learn to beatmatch!""   Beatmatching is the first thing a DJ learns, and in my experience of showing people how to use CDJ's it takes less than a few hours to pick up. It's arguably easier with vinyl due to the rock steady tempo-holdability and the tactile feedback of the platter. So these young DJ's didn't have to learn to beatmatch? Big deal, they got a few hours jump on the pre-automatch DJ's - they've still got a hell of a lot more to learn. The true skill of a DJ (and I'm talking about what this guy is trying to do, not turntablism) comes from [edit: finding and] knowing their tracks, coming up with creative transitions between those tracks, and reading the crowd. Due to the creative and cognitive aspects of these skills the format from which the DJ plays their music doesn't really matter. Whether it can beatmatch for them or not matters even less."
cringe,3dajd8,Shit_Lordstrom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:32:13 2015 UTC,There's no doubt that if the headline said Jon Gosselin graduated from Harvard people would raise eyebrows a lot more.  It's true that getting into DJing is easier than other disciplines but with that being said I don't think that takes away from it's capacity for talent. Modern tools have made DJing more accessible and there's no doubt that it's not performing brain surgery but writing off the whole field as talentless based on a couple of beginner videos on YouTube is shortsighted.

This woman is probably in the high 30s, which places her easily in the obese range.  Edit: why the downvotes?  This isn't a matter of opinion; ""obese"" has a specific medical definition.

It is a rough estimate of what to expect, for us.   http://www.precisionnutrition.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/MRI-visceral-fat-Figure-1.jpg"

cringe,3dajd8,SelfimmolationPride,0,Wed Jul 15 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are correct. However it's not uncommon to have patients who are obese on paper while looking proportionate in person.   BMI is also a tool and it is not perfect. We use it as a guideline of what to expect and what to prep and have on standby."
cringe,3dajd8,SelfimmolationPride,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  However, I think it's important to note that a lot of people (particularly on online communities like Reddit) tend to dismiss BMI for the wrong reasons.  It is true that BMI is a guideline and does not account for all body types (after all, it's simply a ratio of body weight to height).  However, these false positives (people who have high BMIs despite having a healthy body fat percentage) are people who are in extremely good shape.  I hear a lot of people on here saying that the whole construct of BMI is bunk when in reality it is a helpful tool for the vast majority of people.  Unless you're looking at someone who is a serious athlete, then BMI is most likely giving a good picture of whether that person needs to lose weight.  Either way, the people in the linked images certainly do not fall into the group for whom BMI is not an accurate reading of healthy body size."

They're thanking BOTH god and the surgical team. Religion is a huge coping mechanism and is psychologically an aid to millions of people around the world, of course they acknowledge the surgeon's skill and role in saving a life, what's it to you if they also thank God? You think the surgeon cares? No, a good surgeon relies on the fact that he did his job and saved a life, he doesn't need the exterior praise or something as pedantic as having the patients NOT thank god.  But regardless of that sidenote, where do you get off on feeling some sort of self-righteous revenge because you didn't give money to someone who didn't specifically thank you. That's not the point of charity, charity is a thankless, generous act. An act of charity doesn't require a return message, it's not based on who you like because of some arbitrary thanking of the wrong person, it goes to the people in need, period."

Why waste effort on those who won't even acknowledge the fact the only reason they are alive is because of chance or more likely the help from another person.

Notice the guy lying back with his face in his hands came back to earth as soon as the other guy said something back to have a conversation and he realised the original cringe moment was over, when he probably have done that a lot longer to make the guy look bad.

It was originally intended to be part of a Channel 4 series featuring comedians talking to their comedy heroes, but in April 2006, Channel 4 announced that Ricky was to get a four part series off the back of the interview with David, broadcast on January 5 2006. On 25 December and 26 December of 2006, Channel 4 aired two specials where Ricky interviewed Christopher Guest and Garry Shandling respectively.   Gervais' interview with Garry Shandling is perhaps the most memorable of the three shows, as the two men do not appear to get along. Shandling is combative and discourteous to Gervais throughout the interview, and even goes so far as to suggest that Ricky is unwilling to cast Jews in his shows. Their exchange ends with Ricky being visibly relieved that the interview is over. Gervais hasn't talked about the interview since it aired, and the series was  put on hold indefinitely."

Though he’d never appeared on the show, Gervais had spoken openly about how Sanders inspired him. So Garry called Gervais and asked if he’d do it. The answer was yes, but Gervais also had a request. While he was in Garry’s home, could they also shoot his Channel 4 show? Shandling agreed, and all was well until the day of the dueling interviews, when wires got crossed. Garry says he assumed they would shoot the “visit” for the DVD extra first, because “that laid-back, not-on tone is good preparation for saying, ‘Let’s turn it on'” later, for Gervais’s special.  But when Shandling walked into his kitchen, he realized instantly that Gervais thought the Channel 4 special was being shot first. Gervais was on—extremely so—and so were several cameras. Garry could have said something but wanted to see what would happen if he played it out. What if he stayed in the same low-affect head space he was in to do his DVD extras? Could he reach Gervais without explicitly identifying the problem? Could he bring Gervais’s energy level down?  “It’s fascinating, really,” Garry tells me. “We both became locked into the shows we were each doing, and it became a bit of a boxing match. Because he’s trying to get me to do the show that he needs, and I’m trying to get him to do nothing. I was trying to pull Ricky into the moment.”"

Shandling (whom I never liked) was either attempting to be disaffected and smarmy and it flopped or he was just being a straight up prick. This wasn't a comedic genius honing his craft to go toe to toe with another titan of comedy. At best it was an asshole out-assholing another asshole, and he wasn't doing it on purpose.  It's very rare when a comic can leave a an awkward situation with Gervais and come out on the ass end of it. That takes a special kind of douchenozzlery..."

It was after seeing that, I realised Garry was being a dick on purpose. It was so on point it felt scripted."
cringe,3d0fn3,DeusMexMachina,53,Sun Jul 12 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I picked up on it the second time Gervais walked away and Shandling didn't follow. Then I was trying to figure out if Gervais was in on it...personally I thought it was very well done."
cringe,3d0fn3,HungryMoblin,12,Sun Jul 12 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gervais caught it at all, or his performance in the video is extremely convincing. I read this comment chain before watching the video and I'm glad I did. It made a lot of sense watching it through looking for cues. When he answered his phone twice, that was the nail in the coffin for me. There's no fucking way he wasn't being intentionally (and playfully) mean during this. Ricky didn't realize that he was the straight man. I don't know how he couldn't though, when Garry started talking about having sex with animals. I think what happened is he might have realized it, but much later than intended.  I love the very end where Garry asks Ricky if they're going to film the DVD footage for his show now and calls after Ricky when he's rushing out."
cringe,3d0fn3,veggiter,85,Mon Jul 13 09:11:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, from what I've seen of Gervais's work like this, he's almost never deadpan and finds the awkwardness and comments on it.  He does more meta-comedy (in things like this) than he does deadpan, awkward humor.  He can't keep a straight face for shit, and it's very obvious when he's jokingly fucking with someone. He more misbehaves in these types of settings than he plays a character on them.   That is, this seemed like it was supposed to be a funny interview, and some ball-breaking was to be expected.  Garry (if his explanation wasn't just backpedaling from actually being a dick) misread it as something akin to Between Two Ferns, which was simply wrong.  He pretty much Joaquin Phoenixed the interview.  Maybe funny for him, but totally wrong for the show."
cringe,3d0fn3,Johnny_Couger,16,Sun Jul 12 18:49:06 2015 UTC,The other thing is that Ricky often admits that he is terrible at improv. All of his shows are expertly scripted.  They talked about it on Best of show (or one of the Christopher Guest movies). Gervais' comedy style was completely at odds with the Guest's but they made it work.
cringe,3d0fn3,veggiter,2,Sun Jul 12 20:35:23 2015 UTC,I could see that. He doesn't seem like he could spontaneously think within the mindset of a particular character.  He's too observational.
cringe,3d0fn3,Johnny_Couger,2,Sun Jul 12 23:53:48 2015 UTC,If you ever see him off the cuff he can't quit laughing and he has a very unique laugh.

cringe,3d0fn3,Schadenfreuder,13,Sun Jul 12 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"I watched it three years ago when it was added to Netflix. Knew nothing about it, ended up watching every episode within weeks.  Which season did you watch and which single-camera comedies do you think are funny? I'm sure I could find a similar plot point to show you they attempted a single joke or funny situation.  It's okay to not enjoy something, humans have widely varying degrees of opinion on what's funny. I don't find Tosh.0 funny. I find Louis CK funny. Louis CK finds Daniel Tosh funny. So am I right and Louis CK is wrong, he just nods along and agrees Tosh.0 is funny?"
cringe,3d0fn3,kwood09,15,Sun Jul 12 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"I watched the first season and part of the second. My favorite single-camera comedy is definitely the American version of The Office. I also like the British version. My next favorite shows are Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, Parks & Recreation, It's Always Sunny. I also like 30 Rock and Louie, but I haven't watched them extensively.    So am I right and Louis CK is wrong, he just nods along and agrees Tosh.0 is funny?   I'm not saying that anyone's wrong for liking The Larry Sanders Show. I thought it was mildly entertaining. I just didn't think it was very funny. I understand that it was apparently a big break from tradition and a precursor to all the shows I like these days. But the strangest thing was that it didn't seem like it had failed jokes or attempts at situations -- instead, it just seemed like a very flat, subdued depiction of a talk show host's life.   By contrast, a show like Two Broke Girls has a lot of (what I would call) failed attempts at humor. I recognize that it was a joke and I can see why other people think it's funny, but it's just not my thing. I personally don't like it, but I don't think other people are wrong for liking it. However, with The Larry Sanders Show, it just seems very boring and flat. It's not that it's bad humor, like how I view Big Bang Theory or Two and a Half Men or whatever; instead, I just don't see the jokes. Maybe I don't get it. Maybe it's a Seinfeld is Unfunny sort of deal."

The Larry Sanders show is one of the greatest shows of all time. Its a very black comedy, almost could be considered a drama first, revolving around narcissistic personalities,  the public/private personas of celebrity and Sanders plays a cathedral of uncomfortable.  This interview is a car crash. But, then none of the pervious interviews were very good too. The other guests played along; with Larry David having a look of withdrawn  amusement at Gervais' antics, but rarely were they insightful nor more than a chummy backslapping.  Sanders is an acquired taste, and seems something from another era, just like Woody Allen's default neurotic character, but without Allen's humbleness and easy likability. Sanders is the uncomfortable neurotic, the imposter syndrome writ large.  I view this interview as Sanders not playing along with Gervais' simplistic premise, and playing his difficult, tetchy brand of humour & characterisation, and never playing to the normal and familiar. The perception is of two alley cats, pre-fight, Gervais ""Jimming"" the camera, Sanders playing to the subconscious about the fakery we witness in celeb chums talking about comedy.  Tldr; drunk but need to say The Larry Sanders show is one of my favourite shows ever, and I'm not sure why."

cringe,3d0fn3,scottyLogJobs,61,Mon Jul 13 05:29:19 2015 UTC,There's collaborative awkwardness for comedy effect and then there's playing the victim and calling someone anti-semitic. Garry just seems like a dick in honesty.
cringe,3d0fn3,J-Nice,10,Sun Jul 12 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he can say ""oh I was doing it on purpose"" all he wants, and yeah, he clearly meant to be deliberately cold and off-putting (like recognizing that it was rude to answer the phone, for instance), but I don't think it was coming from a place of humor. I think that he didn't like Ricky and wanted to make him feel bad and uncomfortable. I wouldn't be surprised if he meant what he said about the anti-Semitic comment and looking down on Ricky for his style of humor."
cringe,3d0fn3,Khanstant,57,Sun Jul 12 14:57:13 2015 UTC,I have no idea who that Garry guy is but he seems like a total prick. Pulling the race card is a scummy move. This looks quite old so he probably didn't really know who Ricky was  and just thought he could be a dick to him.
cringe,3d0fn3,BeatDigger,55,Sun Jul 12 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"I think Garry knew Rickys humor is based on making people uncomfortable, and he decided he was going to turn the tables on him. It didnt play out the way he wanted and we are left with that train wreck of an interview that actually fulfilled the intended purpose of being awkward. Although I really think the sort of awkwardness achieved was unintended."

cringe,3d0fn3,kvothesnow,18,Tue Jul 14 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"ITT: Milennials don't really know Garry Shandling's work.   All his career, he has created awkward situations in order to see what kind of improv comes out of it. He was very influential on Larry David in this way. In When Ricky Met Garry, he used the confusion of the situation (is this for the DVD extra or is it for Ricky's show?) to create opportunities for improv. Unfortunately it didn't work out for the future of Gervais' series. But Garry (and apparently Gervais too) was willing to take that risk. The hour is kind of a comic masterpiece.  This is totally consistent with what others have said about how Garry works.  He's an asshole for other reasons (read about the sexual harassment lawsuit his co-star and former girlfriend filed against him after The Larry Sanders Show ended).   Edit: added a question mark"

The comedic genius from both of these guys for that 8 minutes, or the fact that it was so good people can't even see it and are taking sides and bitching, which is still a part of the joke and also brilliant.  Ricky and Garry are both very, very good at uncomfortable situational humor. There is just no way either of them would not pick up on the others behavior and run with it, like improv.  This looks like a ""don't meet your heros"" tale on the surface, but the story is that it's actually bit of a roast of Ricky by Garry. One last demonstration of a masters skills before passing the torch to the apprentice. To have your hero of uncomfortable humor show you how it's done with you as the subject, and you get to show off to them how well you can escalate the situation by playing the straight man, yeah that joke was deeper than you thought, I'm convinced they are both laughing at everyone over this interview and knew exactly what the other was doing.  TL;DR this whole interview is Andy Kaufman level mind fuckery and it is hilarious."

I find this kind of conflict just as good as a happy go lucky interview - and certainly much more plausible. The bland interviews on tv are much more idealized and phony. This is meaty and good. And clashing personalities are part of human nature - this is much more honest than Jimmy Fallon's awful fake laughter and constant applause.

Wayne was generally acting uninterested and disrespectful about the whole thing, but there's one great moment where, although it appears he's just being intentionally difficult, he's actually genuinely confused.  The deposing attorney asks him, with respect to some event that he claims to not remember ""Isn't that something that you'd remember?""  Wayne genuinely thinks he means ""isn't that something"" in the colloquial form, as in ""ain't that something else?!"", so it appears to him as if the deposing attorney is asking his opinion about the noteworthiness of his ability to recall some event, but in a very informal way.

You can get their stuff legally for free at that link, and here is a sample track.  Hooverphonic's first three albums are great as well, those guys are pretty well known if you're in Europe.  Another great one is Emptyself, very high quality project from a singer/songwriter who also has a A Perfect Circle style rock project."

Mostof his problems seem largely self inflicted. I know alcoholism is a serious thing, but as the host said, there's still a level of professionalism you need to hold yourself to.

cringe,3d1f01,mr_partyman,33,Tue Jul 14 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"What I got from the guy at the end, who seemed really frustrated, short-worded and like he was pumped full of adrenaline, is that the band did not show up for sound check, and the reason that they could never get the damn song going is because the levels were all fucked up and they couldn't hear either each other or themselves. So essentially it's the own band's fault for trying to be lazy rockstars earlier in the day that they were up there just diddling around for 5 minutes when the show started.  They didn't sound too bad but what they were doing is literally just the base of a song. Any band with some talent from high school on could produce about the sound that they were putting out. That guy was supposed to start rocking the hell out with the lead guitar, which was gonna set this band apart, but he never really did because he probably couldn't hear himself or the drums were too loud to hear the rhythm guitar right."
cringe,3d1f01,braunheiser,9,Sun Jul 12 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were decent musicians, it was just the most boring/simple jam I've ever heard/seen played live on stage.   Mediocre Dad bands should stay in dive bars."

Everyone was fine, of course, except the guitarist.  His guitar was out of tune, he was off time, and his strumming was really jumpy and heavy-handed.  I'm not even critiquing based on knowing that he's a professional musician; this level of playing would be pretty disappointing even from a non-musician who has been playing the guitar for a few months."

In order to not be hearing how out of tune this guy's guitar is you'd really have to be quite tone deaf, but if you were tone deaf then I'd imagine that you would identify as such and wouldn't weigh in to say that the performance sounds fine to you.  Do you consider yourself someone who is able to hear when things are in or out of tune?    The other issue was with the rhythm of his guitar playing.  While the drummer was playing a steady beat, the guitar player was dragging and rushing for the entire performance.  His poorly enunciated strumming (he didn't do a good job controlling the dynamics of his performance) made him sound even more out of time.  Anyway, the way this guy is playing is what you would expect from your average high school student who has been playing the guitar for a few months.  It was sufficiently bad that the venue couldn't just chalk it off as a crappy performance and literally stopped it within a couple of minutes."

They think they are this blunt, ironic, hip to be square quirky, but in reality they just have nothing humorous or original to offer.   The problem with women is that they all want to be loved, but very few know how to be liked.  So they invent these personalities that they feel are enduring.    Holding a stupid mustache up to your face doesn't make you quirky, it makes you annoyingly unfunny. They think it's funny when they ironically reply, ""Really?"" to funny things others say.  That's the type of quirky chicks are going for nowadays.  Yuck, no sale here."

Seriously, who in their right mind finds out their kid has been assaulted, and thinks ""oh sweet we'll just take a few million and let the rapist be on his merry way."" Any parent would want justice. When Jackson finally get fed up with shelling out money to avoid bad publicity, he finally called out the family in 2003, took them to court, and was found innocent on every single charge.

Instant runoff is where I prioritize who I would like for president, rather than just voting.  (E.g.: 1. Bernie Sanders, 2. Rand Paul, 3. Hillary Clinton) -- this allows people to vote for third parties without ""wasting"" their vote, because if their favorite candidate loses, their vote ""runs off"" to their next choice until someone has 50%.  This would give us more third-parties and also more moderate candidates from the main parties.   Top-two is a way for parties to compete with themselves.  So, in Texas the Democrat will always lose, and in New York the Republican will always lose.  But maybe there is a conservative Democrat and a liberal Republican running?  Top two would mean that in the final vote in Texas you can choose between two republicans, or two Democrats in New York, assuming that there wasn't enough votes for the other party in the primary."

Trump lies habitually. It has become so second-nature to him when there's a microphone around that I don't know if it's conscious. From small things like whining about China while having his Macy's shirts made there to more serious things like exaggerating his net worth by 100%. If you watched the Apprentice you would know he has a custom of describing everything of his as the best or the top in its game. And it's rarely true. That habit has spilled over into his political aspirations.  His colorful statements during his campaign are rarely true. But that matters little to the type of Conservative he is trying to attract, a very different breed of Republican than he targeted in his ""I might run"" in 2012. The Trump voter is someone acutely concerned with the prospect of rapist immigrants or ISIS members creeping down the alleyway, and what he has to say deeply resonates with them. This type of voter can disregard his famous hedonism, because they're less concerned with being close to Jesus than they are foretelling the fall of America.  As for his business acumen, he has made a nasty habit of being at the helm of failed business ventures while managing to walk away almost scot-free. Savvy? Absolutely. Ethical? No. And a terrible model for what we want the American workforce - both public and private - to be subjected to."

He's been all over the ideological map in the past:   Exhibit A: His comment to NBC's Tim Russert in 1999 that ""I'm very pro-choice."" (That '99 quote is striking, especially considering what he told CNN last month: TRUMP: ""Right, I'm pro-choice."" CNN: ""You're pro-choice or pro-life?"" TRUMP: ""I'm pro-life. I'm sorry."") Exhibit B: His remark on not opposing gays serving in the military in that same 1999 interview. ""Hey, I've lived in New York City and Manhattan all of my life. So my views are a little different than had I lived in Iowa."" (Expect that line in a TV ad to Iowa voters.) Exhibit C: Another 1999 quote from Trump via Buzzfeed. ""I'm very liberal when it comes to health care,"" he said. ""I believe in universal health care.""   There's no reason to think he actually believes what he's saying.

Either you use that kind of logic on both candidates or neither, you can't say Hillary's pandering when she supports gay marriage but when Trump goes from pro-choice to anti-choice and from universal healthcare to fuck nah never mind, forget universal healthcare, he's just had a legitimate change of heart."
cringe,3cx9n2,090078601,15,Sun Jul 12 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"It's not just that he's changed his position. It's that he's changed to absolute extremist positions that will play well with the Republican base.   His big immigration policy is that he will build a wall along the Mexican border and somehow force Mexico to pay for it. That's a not a policy. It's masturbatory fodder for the Id of the Republican party.  His policies are nonsensical and designed only to grab attention. Plus, much of bluster is disingenuous on its face. He rants and raves about China, but he makes all of his clothing there. Just like he hires undocumented immigrants to build his hotels.  How are you falling for this crap?"
cringe,3cx9n2,typicalredditer,9,Sun Jul 12 02:20:27 2015 UTC,"He rants and raves about China, but he makes all of his clothing there.   “It’s a lovely tie,” Tapper acknowledged, asking if it is hypocritical of Trump to talk about bringing manufacturing back to the United States while making his ties in China.  “Not at all” Trump said. ”They’ve cut their currency – I talk about my ties in speeches…They’ve manipulated their currency to such a point that it’s impossible for our country to compete.”  Him taking advantage of a poor system so his company can make money doesn't instantly disqualify him from speaking out against it.   His comment to NBC's Tim Russert in 1999 that ""I'm very pro-choice."" (That '99 quote is striking, especially considering what he told CNN last month: TRUMP: ""Right, I'm pro-choice."" CNN: ""You're pro-choice or pro-life?"" TRUMP: ""I'm pro-life. I'm sorry."")   "" One thing about me, I'm a very honorable guy. I'm pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the primary reasons I changed [was] a friend of mine's wife was pregnant, and he didn't really want the baby. He was crying as he was telling me the story. He ends up having the baby and the baby is the apple of his eye. It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to him. And you know here's a baby that wasn't going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.""  If he's telling the truth, he changed his attitude towards abortion for reasons other than pandering to voters 4 years later in 2015.   How are you falling for this crap?   Not automatically accusing him of pandering when he could simply just be having normal change of opinion doesn't mean I'm falling for anything."
cringe,3cx9n2,tupendous,13,Sun Jul 12 03:19:42 2015 UTC,Not automatically accusing him of pandering when he could simply just be having normal change of opinion doesn't mean I'm falling for anything.

I do wish though that the GOP could get a serious candidate. I can't take Trump seriously. He jumped on the birther bandwagon a few years back before his last presidential bid flamed out. I believe this presidential bid will also flame out fast. He has no political savvy.   It's a depressing time to be a republican. Clinton will probably win easily, even though she has so much baggage that a proper opponent could expose her. The GOP just simply has no one."

cringe,3cv9e0,LiterallyKesha,59,Sat Jul 11 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"I saw DJ Khaled at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

The over the top music videos, pop rap that isn't really about anything other than women and money. His music videos are so over the top, he has one where he opens a bottle of champagne underwater. I really think he knows what he's doing, and he is essentially a genius parodying the music he makes. DJ Khaled is an undercover genius."

Grades are how much money you're making, people cheat all the time, and people fail hard and keep failing. We should be tutoring eachother, not making it into a competitive society. That's all capitalism is doing is fueling the competition and they start that blood lust in school. Kids thirst for the best grades in class and to beat their counterparts because it's encouraged.

The hosts are the ""Breakfast Club,"" which consists of; DJ Envy - the DJ, Charlemagne - the voice of controversy, and Angela Yee - the voice of reason.   Nicki Minaj, at the time this video is linked, has become angry with not only the Breakfast Club, but also all radio because she thinks that radio stations only play her popular songs instead of her entire album. She is right, as they do almost only play the most popular songs, but it makes sense for the radio station from a business standpoint.   Another point she makes is that the Breakfast Club doesn't listen to all of an artist's current music before inviting them to come on the show. It is slightly unfair and unreasonable, considering the popularity of the Breakfast Club, and how they do interviews like this almost every day.   Finally, the way the interviewers respond to Nicki's accusations might be seen as dismissive or rude, but their popularity comes from their shtick of asking hard questions and not backing down. They have been in many similar situations in past interviews and have become good at moving on and making it work."

cringe,3curgw,Taj_Ramos,-1,Sat Jul 11 09:10:09 2015 UTC,"No, because donating to a streamer consistently average over 15,000 viewers for 8 hours a day on the grounds of ""appreciation"" is an absurdity.  That'd be like me donating $500 to Robert Downey Jr. to ""show my appreciation"" when he obviously doesn't need it.  If you're going to say why people are donating, just go ahead admit it's because they have their names plastered in front of 15,000 people along with whatever they want to say.  Not only does their favorite streamer read it aloud for them, the entire chat sees it and they essentially get to control the stream and chat for a few seconds.  In the case of Reynoodle, that's where he's getting most of his donation money from and that's fine.  What's not fine in people's eyes is the idea some people are just throwing huge bucks at him because they ""appreciate"" him, even though he's already loaded.  Why would you treat a rich person like him like a charity case?"

cringe,3curgw,WanaBeSweet,47,Fri Jul 10 23:10:21 2015 UTC,Reynad is a popular streamer who often gets shit on by his viewers for being bad at picking up girls and just other jokes and he takes them in good fun for the most part. He decided to invite a girl to fly to california to visit him and they ended up streaming and he wanted to bang her. His whole stream was basically a cringe fest of donation messages either trying to get him laid or make it awkward as fuck. She had no interest in him at all and lead to some drama afterwards still unfolding but the actual stream was really entertaining because of how uninterested she was and how bad he was failing at picking her up. Honestly it probably wouldnt be that funny for someone that isnt watching streams/fans but thats the brief rundown.
cringe,3curgw,nipplehead09,18,Fri Jul 10 23:51:09 2015 UTC,what kind of drama has been unfolding since this video was made?
cringe,3curgw,JupitersClock,53,Sat Jul 11 02:04:57 2015 UTC,Her telling her side earlier in the day saying Reynad thirsty as fuck she wasn't there to sex him and he basically got drunk and went up to her room while she was on her comp and made a move and got rejected then told her to rebook her flight.
cringe,3curgw,nipplehead09,36,Sat Jul 11 02:14:46 2015 UTC,haha oh man that's hilarious. i saw him sipping some beer and some wine during the vid. i guess the commenters gave him some confidence to make a move.

Not every girl would think its cool but this girl in particular was just starting off as a streamer so yeah I definitely would put her on stream with me as well.

Plenty of people work their hands to the bone, two jobs, 16-20 hour work days, and if they took this kind of attitude once on the floor, they'd be fired.  Like, why defend Denzel Washington? Denzel clocked off on his shift, got on a private airplane with catering, and had many free hours where he could contact his therapist or agent and piss and moan for hours, all to his heart's content, with any luxury possibly imagined available to him. Humans are humans, no man is give leave from the instinct of men, of course. Still, I ask for more from individuals who have credentials and support nets that other working professionals don't have.

I totally agree with the sentiment that every job, even 'dream jobs', can have days of total bullshit that leave you in a bad mood.  The point is that treating your work colleagues (which, for an actor doing PR, an interviewer is) like garbage  because of that is not excusable. If Denzel can't star in movies and then do PR for them without being a prick, then maybe he shouldn't be signing up to do any more movies."

He's going to regret freezing up like that for the rest of his life. Should've been more prepared though seeing as he had a huge sign challenging Satchel."

cringe,3cscvd,rijala,38,Fri Jul 10 20:16:44 2015 UTC,Why are we assuming it's the language she has a problem with and not just her being too shy to scream into a mic in front of hundreds of people?

cringe,3cscvd,gay_unicorn666,48,Fri Jul 10 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"I had something mildly similar happen to me.  I used to play mandolin in a folk-punk type band, and when I was pretty new to the band still, we were playing a show to about ~500 people and a fan yelled for the frontman to take off his pants.  He said into the mic ""gay_unicorn666 over there is the new guy, so maybe he should be the one taking off his pants"" or something like that.  Well after a few minutes, the entire crowd is chanting ""gay_unicorn666 take off your pants"" over and over while I stand there uncomfortably and awkwardly try to laugh it off.  I wasn't about to take my instrument off, bend down and unlace my boots, and hop around trying to pull off my too-tight jeans in front of 500 people.  The chanting went on for about 12 hours I think, before the band finally saw this was not going anywhere and began playing the next song.  I had also brought a girl to the show that I had recently went out with a few times, so that made it even worse for me, though somehow she just seemed to think it was funny and didn't even notice how embarrassed I was."
cringe,3cscvd,ispawn_94,65,Fri Jul 10 14:58:31 2015 UTC,I really hope they called you gay_unicorn666 and not your real name

cringe,3cscvd,gay_unicorn666,20,Fri Jul 10 15:54:45 2015 UTC,It still went great for about a year until they started changing their sound from folk-punk type stuff to more heavy punk stuff with less folk.  Mandolin didn't exactly fit in great after that and I was left feeling like I had no musical place in the band.

cringe,3cscvd,DouglassFunny,15,Fri Jul 10 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"Oh god this kinda happened to me. I used to think I was a musician, except I never really learned theory, I just played guitar and learned other peoples songs. I sounded pretty good, but I couldn't play on the spot, especially songs I didn't know.   During my ""musician years"" I went to a concert to see a well known indie band about 10 years ago. I was watching one of the openers, a band i've never heard before. Before I knew It me and my buddies were pulled on stage, and they tried handing me a guitar, I knew I was going to bomb it, and asked to go onto the drums instead. They refused. Everyone starts to play, I freeze up, and could only manage to sloppily play two or three notes. I repeated those notes throughout the process, and the lead singer starts singing ""we all live in a yellow submarine"". I look out into the crowd, and see a bunch of jaded, cynical hipsters giving me the evil eye. These people looked at me like I was the biggest inconvenience ever. Keep in mind, this is a crowd at a popular venue in hollywood. At least 200 people in the crowd watching me melt down.   The friends(some friends, right?) who I showed up with started spreading behind my back that I was a joke on guitar, and telling people not to play with me anymore(I had some really bad jam sessions with some of these guys). Whenever I hear ""yellow submarine"", I think of the night that ended my music career, and crushed my dreams. But hey, at least I performed to a crowd of 200+ in hollywood, so i guess I made it after all. This was definitely one of my most cringe worthy moments, as I was exposed as a talentless hack in front of 200+ strangers, and a group of friends."

cringe,3cuiwd,humanbeingarobot,2,Sun Jul 12 02:19:19 2015 UTC,I figured it out too late.
cringe,3cuiwd,pusspunter,10,Sun Jul 12 02:26:46 2015 UTC,"EMT here.  Doctors rarely do chest compressions, especially doctors who work in shitty tiny little stand alone ERs. The chest beaters are always Nurses, Techs, and EMT's - all the docs really do is check the ECG for a viable rhythm to shock, because contrary to popular belief you do not shock asystole (flatline). They also give Epi, Bicarb, atropine..ect   Nurses keep track of times and thats basically it. Hell the doc probably wouldnt even be the one to intubate the patient, often thats done by the medics or respiratory if they are lucky enough to have one there when the code happens.    All this to say, I'm not surprised she sucked at CPR. I've seen doctors ask medics to do CPR, Intubations, Chest decompressions..ect all because they get so caught up with ""doctor"" things that they let their skills atrophy."
cringe,3cuiwd,xXConfuocoXx,5,Sat Jul 11 09:28:52 2015 UTC,"While that is extremely cringeworthy and unacceptable for a physician in my opinion, as someone else mentioned you will very rarely see a physician doing compressions. Compressions are a very basic task that are usually delegated to supporting staff. By ""done CPR"", she probably meant ""run a code"", aka manage everyone else in the room and tell people what to do rather than doing things herself. That or she was just flat out lying and works in a specialty where she doesn't see emergencies."

cringe,3cuiwd,tichik,9,Sat Jul 11 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"BLS or basic life support, is the basic class for health care professionals (sometimes called BLS for Health Care Professionals); this is minimum that most place require their staff to have - it focuses on CPR and the use of the automatic external defibrillator.   This is what most cities are going to teaching the public, there used to be an even more simplified class that doesn't include the AED but now that they are becoming so common in public places, it is important for members of the public to learn the use of an AED as well. My hospital also teaches a class to large groups of people that teaches the ""push hard and fast"" method that makes it as simple as possible hoping that the majority of people will at least know that.  There is also Advanced Cardiac Life Saving, but many places don't require all staff to have that, especially at a hospital, because there is usually a team that will respond and take over ACLS.   I'm a BLS instructor and just taught a class today. Our doctors all are ACLS certified so they renew BLS with ACLS."

cringe,3cuiwd,WurdSmyth,3,Sat Jul 11 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"My guess is that she was lying and maybe had done CPR once during residency on someone who was going to die anyway. An EMT friend told me about a similar tradition at his station.  If we were in a real emergency I and hopefully anyone else would say, ""get of the way"" and take over after watching such bad technique.   The instructor did try correcting her a bit but at the end of the class I still don't think she was adequately performing but she works in a big hospital so hopefully someone else there is qualified."

They also give orders on what will be done about treatment. The nurses and medics are the ones that do all the physical procedures which would make it perfectly understandable that she was out of practice. She KNEW a lot, but could not perform. It doesn't make her a bad doctor."
cringe,3cuiwd,OSN1,2,Tue Jul 14 10:33:11 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that she said she's performed many CPR's...
cringe,3cuiwd,swedishtaco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:22 2015 UTC,It could have been years since her last performance and has since gotten out of shape. She also did not say if they were successful CPRs. She could have been a nurse or medic a decade ago but stopped doing CPR when she became a doctor. Like I said she knew her shit and could answer all the questions but she was out of shape and rusty when it came to actually performing.
cringe,3cuiwd,botsects,-27,Tue Jul 14 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"There was a female doctor (MD) taking the course and she said,   Just curious. What was the need to write ""female doctor"" instead of ""doctor""?   Is ""female"" relevant to the story?"
cringe,3cuiwd,dwhee,7,Sat Jul 11 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"Before I answer I'll say the other people in the class were also women (RNs) and I and another guy were the only 2 men. Everyone but this doctor thrusted well and adequate speed.  That said the lack of technique was stereotypically feminine. It was very weak with bent elbows, pressure through the fingers and limp wristed. I don't know how else to describe it but it was girly and not womanly. I'm not a writer.  I've got a lot of respect for women and my mom was an RN. I think it was relevant to the story.   Also it was a bigger let down because she was very skinny and frail looking yet she had done CPR to so many people I think we were all thinking ""Man she must be awesome to be so skinny and do CPR so well"". The rest of us were a lot meatier."

cringe,3cs2v7,TacoTuesday24,9,Sat Jul 11 07:06:14 2015 UTC,yea his name is Dan Colman and this win caused a shit storm in the poker community because after winning he basically said that people shouldn't play poker and he doesn't really care about the community which people took offense to. He also probably sold most of his profit percentage to buy into the tournament which could be a reason why he didn't look that happy.

If so, I think that's a valid expression for a winning poker player. He's still in that role because he's gotten accustomed to it during the tournament, the same way that you'll still be hyped after a good concert or ballgame, just in reverse.

If he complains afterwards you tell him with professionalism that it wasn't the right choice for the audience. It doesn't matter if it was or not, at least you sound like you're reading the audience.  Also, can't believe how many ""professional"" hype men miss this point: you don't want to just randomly shout ""B"" so why the hell should the audience want to? Do they not realize there's a reason people go: ""Poland, are you having a fucking party?"" murmur ""I said, Poland, are you having a motherfucking party tonight?"" actual cheers You've gotta warm them up so they're ready to do something this ridiculous. And if they just keep murmuring, you just say ""alright..."" As if they did a brilliant job and move on. Worst case scenario, is that it now just looks like a bad audience with an average hype man.

Kanye West put his soul into that album told all his secrets to the world and produced some crazy good thematic instrumentals, or whoever produced them the overall cohesiveness of MBDTF is just masterpiece-worthy IMO. The first track with the Disney-like Nicki Minaj intro, the interludes (WHO will survive in America?) the extended intro to All of the Lights... it really is a high quality top shelf piece of work.   The instrumental outros on a lot of the tracks... sick verses on Monster... fucking Hell of a Life... damn I am going to YouTube now.

cringe,3clnrg,Muffinizer1,2,Thu Jul 9 06:31:58 2015 UTC,"Gender dysphoria is a part of the puzzle, but just because that's labeled as a mental illness, doesn't equate to ""all trans people are mentally ill."" For one, transgenderism is not in the DSM like it used to be. This is because the consensus moved away from it being a mental illness, to being part of the normal human fabric. For most of us, once we start treatment the dysphoria aspect diminishes completely. So you could say pre-transition people suffering from gender dysphoria have signs of mental illness. But someone who is transitioned and well adjusted is ideally ""cured"" of gender dysphoria."

There's a regular caller who always greets Howard with, ""Hey Howard, ya hook-nosed Jew bastard,"" and Howard cracks up at it because it's not mean-spirited. Andy's comments were just nasty and racist. ""Fucking Jew."" ""Money-grubbing Jew."" ""Hateable piece of shit."" This is after Howard had him on the air so many times to promote his work.    Howard fired back, just like he does any time, and for 40 minutes, not 2 hours like you keep claiming. Howard's response was actually pretty cool-headed and ended with him saying that Andy is sad, which he is. Andy's a total disaster.  What I'd like to see is one single example of Howard going on a racist rant like Andy did. You won't find it."

This was very polar on the scale of how he usually is. He's typically controversial, but not straight-up rude like that. Stern actually collects pens so my Dad (a long-time fan) mailed his Air Force Retirement pen and received a really nice hand-written note from Stern and he also mentioned it on the air.

People just hear ""HOWARD INTERVIEWED A PROSTITUTE THAT SCUM"" and then no one even listens to him, they just judge him as gross. I listen to his show a lot and I am a big fan. But when you have you talk for 4 hours a day, you say a lot and people learn a lot. The percentage of him being an asshole and someone else is probably the same, his is just more frequently broadcasted. He is all for equal rights, especially gay and trans people. He has apologized for how he used to treat guests.   That all being said. I can't stand this video. Too much howard."
cringe,3cm2yc,Nahbruh123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"To me it's not who he interviews it's how he does it. You want to interview a prostitute? Fine. Go for it. You want to ask hard questions and make her uncomfortable, maybe make fun of her? Sure, that could be interesting. But to me at least whenever he has women on the show Howard always just sounds like an ugly little asshole dork who got famous and rich and can now use that to get women to do whatever he wants now. It's all ""Ha you broads need to get naked and kiss or else I won't throw this money at you!"" Which honestly isn't even offensive to me as much as it's just annoying and tiresome. We get it dude you have money and can get girls to do all the things they wouldn't do when you were a pizza faced 15yr old. Congrats. It's just boring to me. Maybe that resonates with some people but I guess it's just not my kind of show. Then to top it off he does stuff like this... Which is honestly gross.   But hey if he's apologized for how he treated her and some of his other fans and really meant it then I guess that's something"

cringe,3cm2yc,Qinella,6,Thu Jul 9 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"How, exactly, does that apply to Howard's case? He was a poor kid from New York with a father who worked in radio engineering and he built the biggest show in the nation and arguably made satellite radio a viable thing. The talent involved in show business is getting people to watch. Howard did that better than any other DJ in history. How you can say he's talentless is beyond me."

You judge someone's talent as a radio host by how good they are as a radio host.

Edit, it all worked out in the end: http://news.nationalpost.com/news/rapping-mcdonalds-order-not-disorderly-conduct-judge-rules   “The restaurant manager told police that as the teens drove away that night, Dauwalder yelled at her, ‘I hate this (expletive) McDonald’s anyway.’ Prosecutors said he ‘acted in an angry, threatening, tumultuous manner’ and sped recklessly out of the parking lot.  Timoko testified that she felt threatened and was initially afraid the teens were following her in the car.  ‘That’s why I called the cops. I don’t care that they were rapping,’ she said.”   So no, they didn't ""get arrested for rapping"".  http://blogs.findlaw.com/legally_weird/2010/05/teen-found-not-guilty-of-disorderly-conduct-for-mcdonalds-rap.html   The case was never about the rapping but instead about disruption of the business and alleged threatening behavior toward a restaurant employee, Wright said.   Someone made an allegation of threatening behaviour, it was investigated and he was cleared."

Though based on this source it seems like it's also stating that they are simply variations of each other.

It didn't stop there, when I was a teenager MTV, and other edgy channels were locked, cds and dvds were thrown away as well.  The hysteria around all this media made me distrust my parents, and to this day I'm still angry. I feel like my parents didn't let me express myself, I wasn't able to be who I wanted to be. All this censorship just led to anger, and in the end it pushed me away from the church."

cringe,3cglae,chris-colour,3,Wed Jul 8 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"To do a 'slater' was to do that sitting position on the toilet. There was an amazing story of a guy who got caught doing it.    */edit: found the story:    Guys this is probably the most embarassing thing that has ever happened to me. I was at my girlfriends house tonight for dinner, and shortly after i had to go #2. My Gf's brother was in the downstairs bathroom, so i went upstairs to use the master bathroom. I was about to take a dump, and I remembered something my friend told me called AC Slatering. AC Slatering is when you take a dump facing backwards on the toilet, just how on saved by the bell AC Slater always sat backwards on a chair. So when I was taking a dump, My stomache was facing the back of the toilet, and my back was facing the door. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and began to get nervous. Since AC SLatering is a tough position to get into, it requires taking off your pants. So there I am sitting in my GF's parents bathroom taking a dump with my pants off and facing the wrong way on the toilet. My dump was about halfway out when the footsteps became closer. I then turned around to see that I had not locked the door. Trying to finish as quickly as I could, I began pushing harder and harder. Suddenly, the door opened, and my gf's mom stood there in shock staring at me. We made eye contact for a split second, and I was so embarassed I wanted to die. I quickly finished up, got dressed, and ran out of the house as quickly as I could. I am expecting my gf to break up with me tommorow. I am so embarassed and I hope my gf doesnt blabber about this, Ill die if anyone else finds out."

The person who was upvoted wasn't saying it was her fault, just that it wasn't a good idea to dress as Moxxi, presumably because the size difference from the original character will take away from all the money, time, effort, etc. put into the costume, because even if it were perfect she would still never look anything like Moxxi."

cringe,3ci7y2,SWEGTA2,12,Sat Jul 11 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"A great way to not offend people is to accept what they say. So a transgender woman is a woman.  What it means to be transgender is that, sometime during your formation in the womb, while your body was configured in a certain way, your brain was configured in another.  See it this way: There are differences between the brains of men and women. Transgender people have brains that more closely match their identified gender rather than their assigned gender.  So what that means is that someone like Caitlin Jenner has a female brain, even if she was born in a male body.  The brain, the, recognizise itself as female. But when it looks at its body, it experiences what is known as dysphoria, a kind of anxiety associated with having a body image that does not match your inner map.  A related disorder (in terms of anxiety etc) is Body Integrity Identity Disorder, where somebody does not perceive a certain limb to be part of their body.  Both of these disorders are very real and cause people a lot of problems. Fortunately, they have solutions.  For BIID, the solution is (for now) to remove the offending limb.  And for transgender people, the solution is to transition so that your presentation (how people perceive you) matches your actual identity."
cringe,3ci7y2,evidently_em,16,Wed Jul 8 15:34:02 2015 UTC,There are actually quite a few studies that show it very much is true.  Here are some brain studies that support it in a number of different brain structures/regions before hormone replacement is started:  1: in the volume of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  2: in the number of neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  3: in the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus  4: in regional gray matter variation
cringe,3ci7y2,ServeChilled,10,Wed Jul 8 05:37:08 2015 UTC,"None of that conclusively demonstrates that any of those things contribute to actual, appreciable differences between the sexes.   Male brains are 10% larger than female brains. Does that mean men are on always smarter than women with smaller brains? What does a larger brain mean, and can any behavioral/intelligence differences be predicted from the size of the brain?  These are the questions that must be asked and answered. It isn't enough to say ""the number of neurons differs"". That means nothing. The sizes of all of those areas differ between men who were born, lived, and died as men, but that doesn't mean anything.  I'm a scientist who has no side in this battle, but I find it interesting that feminists such as the woman who penned this interesting piece for the New York Times fought for decades to make people believe that women are equal to men everywhere but the secondary sexual characteristics.  But now we have a push from the same progressive sort of movement claiming that men and women are different in a way that goes beyond skin deep, and both sides purport to have scientific evidence that the sexes have identical or wholly dissimilar cognitive abilities and tendencies.  It'll be interesting to see what the science eventually bears out."
cringe,3ci7y2,Cycloheptadienyl,0,Wed Jul 8 09:23:45 2015 UTC,"That's very true, interesting approach. I think the idea though is the effects are developed through culture, since gender roles are determined by society. Essentially the differences they are referring to are likely to be a result of that, not innate predispositions so it doesn't necessarily go against the feminist position. In fact it arguably goes with it as women being culturally determined to have different features, so we have to change our culture to be more equal. So I hadn't interpreted it as women and men having inherent differences in brain structure, but that these differences might be developed, which in no way makes them less meaningful.  I'm not sure about the larger brain parts, but does it take into account body size? The encephalization quotient recognizes that bigger brains =/= smarter since then elephants would be a lot more clever than humans. So, that's something to take into account if you happen to have anything on that? Otherwise maybe it's likely that men, on average, have bigger bodies than women and then accounts for the size difference.  I am also very interested to see what the science shows as we can gather more participants and carry out more studies."
cringe,3ci7y2,ServeChilled,4,Wed Jul 8 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"The final study shows that there are some facets that remain, but it later says ""However, MTF transsexuals show a significantly larger volume of regional gray matter in the right putamen compared to men."" So it's instead trying to localize the region that differs more specifically, not contradict the claim. The conclusion even says it is in line with the other research.  The same pattern is not found for homosexuals vs. heterosexuals. No one has said a gay woman is a man in a woman's body. I never made that claim, neither have any of these studies, so that hardly seems relevant.  Yes, the sample sizes are still relatively small, but that doesn't take away from the statistically significant results. More studies can be carried out, but even case studies are extremely important in determining direction of effect and regions to focus on when more participants become available.  The fact that the variations can be caused by cultural factors are a different matter; there's no reason why if these brain differences are developed throughout life rather than innately they are any less meaningful. This doesn't really relate to the small sample sizes issue.  Of course gender identity is created by cultural factors; gender is a social construct, we're not arguing about biological sex, so what you've linked is pretty much in agreement with what I'm trying to say."

cringe,3ci7y2,Tyunre,-4,Wed Jul 8 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"Transgender* is usually used to refer to someone who hasn't had the surgery but still prefers the other gender's pronouns (he/she, her/him) and might, for example, use the bathroom of the gender they feel they identify as.  Transexual is usually used to refer to someone who has had some form of surgery or has started hormone replacement therapy.  Essentially, transgender = social, transexual = biological.  That's the way I've always understood it, at least. It took me a while to recognize there was a difference, but now that some of my friends are transitioning I have more people to explain it to me."
cringe,3ci7y2,ServeChilled,2,Fri Jul 10 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"Alright thats not really correct. Transgendered isnt a word, you just say transgender. Its like saying someones gayed or caucasioned.   Transgender just refers to someone who mentally feels that they wernt born in the correct gender. You don't even have to socially present as the opposite gender to be transgender.  Transexual is someone thats had the operation to change their sex. Because sex is based on whats down below, taking hormones doesnt really count for someone being transsexual.

Okay, so I wasn't entirely off with the definitions, but transgender then is more wide a definition as to what I was saying.

cringe,3ci7y2,ServeChilled,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:14:43 2015 UTC,"You seem to be in the know, I have a question that popped up after reading the thread seeing the picture you added to your comment.  When did the relevancy of ovaries, the uterus, the prostate and so on get completely removed from the ""mainstream""(youtube, blog, reddit) transgender discussion? Is it not relevant ? Was it ever? Is it a taboo topic ?   Even in this very thread a lot of people on both sides of the spectrum are almost solely talking about breasts and penis in regards to sex organs. When I see trans people on video they exclusively speak in the same general terms. Even in your very informative picture, the biological sex part of the human body seems greatly diminished even when including Identity, expression and attraction.  I suppose I'm asking when did ""sexual organs"" start to include just the pretty bits ?  If you could refer me to a blog or article which could cover this seemingly big thing I've completely seem to have missed I'd be grateful. There's a big hole of knowledge on the subject which I seem to be sorely lacking.  The technology isn't there for creating and adding a fully functional womb inside a genderbread person today, but it might be someday."

From Marco's point of view the interviewer still calls him a prick from what the interviewer has seen of him on tv.   Interviewer brings up Marco's ex-wives, Marco bring up interviewers mother.  The latter is a much more harsh, although I've never been married nor do I care enough to look into Marco's married life to see if he had a history of being rude to his wives.  I don't know why the interviewer would get so personal.   Although bringing up a mother's disappointment is probably one of the harshest things you can do."

cringe,3cf6mv,weirdworksagain,75,Tue Jul 7 19:44:36 2015 UTC,Just listen to the first question and how gracefully Marco responds. Then the host implies that his two first wifes divorced Marco because he is a 'rude prick'. Think about the negative emotions that might be connected to two divorces. This isn't the Marco Pierre White roast. He isn't a comedian. Why can't you respect Marco's decision to not put up with that shit?

I think the context of ""cuz the rude prick you come across on tv as, I wouldn't around long either"" is important. It was obviously meant as a jest and he was talking about his tv personality.

Maybe the joke was in poor taste but remember that Marco made a joke about his ex wives first so the flow of conversation seemed pretty light as is.  I don't know, I guess to me it's an extremely odd reaction. This Marco dude's response was pretty well-mannered though (until his own insult mentioning the mother) and that's totally respectable, it's just not something you'd expect someone to respond with on what I assume to be a daily talk show, especially if Marco is as ""graceful"" as you guys say he is.  I guess what I'm saying is if he really didn't like the joke then sure, let the hosts know how you feel and let them apologize and move on, not just walk off like a drama queen."

To sanctimoniously walk out after receiving the apology he requested only made me roll my eyes.

Having learned so much about Marco Pierre White, he's a phenomenal man. He's like an army general.

If they didn't ""insult"" him first, you can damn well be sure he would have been extremely rude at some point in the interview and would have warped the truth in his head to make it somehow OK.  It's a cute clip, but Marco is a huge, huge sporadic asshole that can't seem to control himself interacting with other people at the drop of a hat.  As annoying as these folks were, they were clearly having a go, and being playful. Marco found an opportunity to be a martyr and take the high ground in conversation and took it. No surprise here. He is so dreadfully dramatic and emotionally unstable. Anyone who has ever worked with him says he is easily the hardest person they have ever had to work with, and if you have the opportunity to work with him, don't."

cringe,3cf6mv,ryot820,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:59:17 2015 UTC,It was not a joke.  It was a snide remark and it was meant to belittle and degrade someones integrity.  How should Marco have rebutted that comment by lowering himself to their level? Some people have more integrity than that.    The way those two hyenas start howling after he calls him a prick leaves little room for any type of honest discourse after that comment was made.  Some people have a lower level of tolerance for being made fun of or insulted and are willing to stand up to people who are rude to them.  If that host listened to what Marco said he learned a valuable lesson that day.

cringe,3cfnt5,Etteluor,31,Wed Jul 8 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"This is hard to answer because its exceptionally broad.   People watch tournament streams/high skill players because they find it entertaining to watch great players play against eachother, and possibly because they enjoy the commentary that usually goes on over tournament games, (explaining plays, breakdowns etc). I would imagine this would be the same reason most people watch sports on tv.  Other people watch streamers who are funny. Sure these people probably aren't funny to everyone, i find almost all comedy streamers to be extremely grating and annoying, but people still like them. Think of PewDiePie, Sodapoppin, etc, I don't really know enough of them to name.  Other people like to watch playthroughs of games because they find just watching the gameplay relaxing/entertaining even though they don't want to play themselves at that time. Maybe they want to watch someone play through a game for the story.   I personally watch speedrun streams, because its just amazing to me to see what some people are capable of doing in some games.   There are a lot of different reasons people can watch them.  Also i have no clue who this guy is, but some streamers make ABSURD amounts of money for what they do, so while this guy might be exaggerating by saying ""its his full time job"" for some people, it really is, and its a very well paying one at that."
cringe,3cfnt5,thebige91,3,Wed Jul 8 01:42:03 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that that pewdiepie dude grossed around 4 million last year alone doing his streams.

Forsen accidentally flashed his stream tip account one time while flipping through windows and for that month so far he had 18,000 dollars in donations alone. This is not counting subs, and not counting advertisement money ONLY DONATIONS he made 18,000 dollars. And it was only the 17th of the month. So if he is making around 30,000 a month just in donations.  Source: https://i.imgur.com/OLyQNpk.png"

cringe,3cfnt5,BoneMachineNo13,0,Thu Jul 9 19:42:56 2015 UTC,That's massive!
cringe,3cfnt5,BoneMachineNo13,0,Thu Jul 9 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'll briefly respond to your points as they appear.  -My younger brother plays CounterStrike competitively so I get watching tournament games, explaining plays and breakdowns, etc. I consider competitive gamers to be a niche.  -I get that some streamers like PewDiePie are more broadly popular for being funny for their banter. This still leaves me wondering why so many people who appear pretty ordinary think they're interesting enough to turn their gaming life into their own personal Truman Show.  -I get watching playthroughs. I myself refer to them when i get stuck in a game. I hardly ever appreciate the rambling banter that accompanies it.   I guess the point i'm trying to make is that I don't see why streamers with no discernably unique skills or senses of humor think it's cool to shamelessly ask for donations for essentially no other reason than for them to continue playing video games. The whole thing is an aspect of youtube and the internet in general that I just find tacky and unappealing. Call me cynical but I don't see the value in it."
cringe,3cfnt5,Etteluor,8,Wed Jul 8 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"If someone provides no entertainment value then they will not make much money from streaming. If someone is raking in donations and sub money they have to be filling some sort of entertainment niche.   There are very few popular streamers who actually beg for donation money, but i agree that it's a very obnoxious thing for them to do.  Also to address your second point, sometimes the ""ordinary"" guys can be very entertaining also, assuming they have other redeeming qualities as well. Sometimes people like for someone to be relatable, so as long as they are a good player, or a good host, an ""ordinary"" guy who might not be a top tournament player, or super funny, can become popular."
cringe,3cfnt5,BoneMachineNo13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:29:04 2015 UTC,That's true. I can see the appeal in that. Being relatable or endearing goes a long way too. It's just not for me. The culture of it in general seems like a lot of self promotion which turns me off.

cringe,3cfnt5,AshleyPomeroy,2,Thu Jul 9 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"I think the assumption is that if the top Youtube streamers can earn $7m a year, then if you only earn 1% of that, it's still $70k.  So even if you're only 1% as good, you won't have to get a job and you can have ice cream for tea every night.  Also, narcissism. Kids like to think that they're the centre of the universe. Ultimately you have ""smart"" kids who expect to be rolling in cash, and ordinary kids who don't realise that nobody cares about them, and because there are no barriers to entry there's a steady stream of new talent coming and going."

cringe,3cfnt5,furries,2,Wed Jul 8 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"Well it cuts to the question of why people enjoy watching others engage in activities they could be doing. I think a lot of people like the banter, as you've suggested, but perhaps there's also a subconscious process of comparing what you'd do with what the streamer does, and witnessing the results. You're making a mental gamble every time something substantial happens, and maybe when what you would do aligns with what the streamer does to a successful outcome, it releases serotonin into the brain.  I also think most people are empathetic, and seeing others having fun may bring themselves a bit of joy as well.  It would be interesting to know what the attraction to streamers and Let's Players are. I'm also curious to know if it's a sustainable business. It just seems too easy to scream into a camera while playing a game. The market for that has eventually got to get flooded and crash, right?"
cringe,3cfnt5,BoneMachineNo13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. As a casual gamer, from my perspective it looks as though the streamer culture is inundated with people who think having a camera and a computer qualifies them to be an Internet personality. I'd imagine that even to the intended audience there are just too many streamers.  It makes me think of seeing way too many people taking video at live concerts instead of just enjoying the show. It makes sense for Some people to take video. PewDiePie is like the professional videographer at the show who gets paid. All the other streamers are like the countless concert goers who hold up their iPhones so they can upload a subpar product when they get home."

Donald was that kid who always tried to be funny in middle school, but only succeeded in creating a series of moments that would keep him up for hours on end 20 years later when they peeked out from his memory when he tried to go to sleep. Maybe it's that lack of sleep that explains his horrible business sense. Nothing can explain his complete lack of self awareness or public awareness except that the annoying little kid grew up to come an annoying big shit. Without that trust fund he would have spent most of his life job hopping. As a operations manager, there's no way I would have been able to stand him for more than 6 months.

That was 7 years ago though, so my memory could be eclipsed by the amount of Obama Fever that went on prior to the election.  With Clinton this time around, there is no Obama looming in the mist. Her biggest competition comes in the form of the hipster's champion that is Bernie Sanders.   The simple truth that comes with that, is that this young crowd who hoist Sanders up so high are the same ones who don't actually show up to the polls on election day.   Hillary will win because:   There are a lot of people who will go to make history and vote in the 1st female president. That will be their entire knowledge base going in. ""I can proudly say I voted in the 1st female president and made history."" You might remember these people as the ones who only voted for Obama because he was black. They do exist, and they're idiots. The minority and radical feminist who will vote, not because they want to make history, but because they think a woman will work for THEM. She GETS it, because she's a woman. sigh these people also exist The seasoned Democrat who wouldn't vote for another Bush if it meant they'd lose a limb.  The young ones who actually make it to the polls, and are a combination of the first 3 in one way or another.    Hey, maybe I'm wrong though. Trust me when I say, that I hope I am.

cringe,3cc8j0,Underbelly,10,Tue Jul 7 04:42:23 2015 UTC,Nothing. Not like tanking in other sports in order to get a better draft pick etc. He is doing this because he is immature. We're hoping he grows out of it.

He's hardly yelling, screaming or throwing a tantrum - in fact he's not doing a terrible job of keeping his cool. He's a young dude who has had his lifestyle completely thrown upside down within a relatively short period of time and is now expected to act or feel like someone completely different.  People need to support Nick instead of calling him a disgrace at the drop of a hat: Clearly he's not having the best time at the moment and this shit is tough. Those having a go at him need to get real and think about this shit for a moment. Don't compare him to better or worse mannered players, take him for his own individual.  At the end of the day if you don't care for someone at their worst you don't deserve them at their best."

cringe,3cd7g2,Googoo123450,2,Tue Jul 7 06:45:22 2015 UTC,I think the suffering of animals is a problem only when we ignore it or go out of our way to pretend it's not happening (i.e. Seaworld's treatment of Killer Whales). The idea that we should not eat meat however is pretty obviously ridiculous with even a quick glance at the rest of nature.

cringe,3cd7g2,Bloodrager,0,Tue Jul 7 05:49:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, there really isnt a decent argument against veganism."
cringe,3cd7g2,Epicyyyy,16,Tue Jul 7 09:04:31 2015 UTC,"There's a few good arguments against veganism.   1) Human biology is diverse. While some people can thrive on a completely vegan diet, the majority of people do require some animal proteins to operate at optimal levels.  2) The vegan ""inefficiency"" argument is also not so clear cut. Most animals we eat consume foods that are indigestible to humans (things such as grass or hard seeds). These are also the easiest plants to grow, so we aren't really in competition with feed animals for our food. In fact, eating beef is a sort of sideways way of getting humans to consume grass.  3) Veganism is bourgeois. Never mind the poor in America who guzzle down fast food and could likely benefit from more vegetables in their diet. But in the third world poor, you will rarely find someone who is a vegan. When food is scarce, one cannot afford to turn away any food source. Many are happy to have a goat they can milk, or some chickens for eggs and maybe a soup later on.  4) The ethical argument is also not so clear cut as vegans make it out to be. Arguments about factory farming aside (and there are many hideous practices involved with that which are justly criticized) things such as dairy can be harvested without the deaths or mistreatment of the animals. As for meat, well, if we didn't domesticate certain animals for meat, their populations would be far lower than they are today, and just as subject to misery in the wild. In our system, they don't have to worry about food or being attacked by predators, nor are there widespread diseases. This is all traded for there being a hard stop on their life when they are slaughtered for meat.  Most ethical arguments for veganism tend to fallaciously ascribe human traits and cognition to animals. Animals do not create social groups, friendships, or families as we understand them. In fact, they are likely not aware of what is awaiting them when they are in a feed pen, or being led to a slaughterhouse. Provided their slaughter is done quickly and cleanly, a cow being led to slaughter is not necessarily an act of cruelty."
cringe,3cd7g2,crazydave333,5,Wed Jul 8 02:30:20 2015 UTC,"1) Do you have proof of that? AFAIK, the only thing really missing from a vegan diet is vitamin B12, and you can get that from fortified foods and not have to worry about it at all.  3) Vegan diets can be the cheapest diets—rice and beans are a staple around the world. I will give you that a vegan diet can require more planning, but honestly the most expensive thing that most people eat is probably meat. Vegetarianism at least is unambiguously cheaper than eating meat and honestly would be a big improvement for those who feel unable to make veganism work.  4) It is impossible to put ""arguments about factory farming aside."" That is the whole point of not eating animal products for many people. Also, I don't know if you are really examining the bigger picture of animal products. How do you think they keep cows producing milk? By keeping them pregnant all the time. What do they do with the male calves? Do they raise them to old age in peace or even slaughter them as adults for meat? No, dairy cattle is not the right breed for beef, so the calves become veal. I don't really consider that humane. And how about male chicks in the egg industry? Killed right after hatching pretty much everywhere. Many people don't realize that, but these facts are the reality of the egg and dairy industry."

cringe,3cb1j9,rasing,45,Mon Jul 6 14:44:49 2015 UTC,That was actually adorable...  until I read the comment about dementia.
cringe,3cb1j9,careless_sux,47,Mon Jul 6 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Kind of sad, actually.  What's likely going on here is that he's experiencing some dementia, which can result in people forgetting what things are and how to use them properly.  There isn't a single person of his age in the developed world who isn't familiar with how to hold a microphone, so this seems like the most likely scenario."
cringe,3cb1j9,Rain12913,3,Mon Jul 6 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible that you're right, however there are other plausible explanations besides dementia. I can imagine that for some of his generation who have never had a smart phone, this new-fangled technology must be quite befuddling for them. Since the microphone is of a modern design and what's more is wireless too, perhaps he just assumed that it worked like a phone."
cringe,3cb1j9,Carthagefield,13,Mon Jul 6 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"I just don't see that as possible.  Microphones have been in common usage since before this guy was born.  Images of people speaking into microphones have been some of the most famous images of the 20th century, so this guy grew up seeing photographs and posters of people speaking into microphones.  The one in the video is definitely more modern-looking than the ones he grew up with, but microphones have looked pretty similar to that since the 1970s, when this guy would have been in his early thirties.  Anyway, yeah obviously we can't know for sure, but given how common dementia is in people his age - and that doing something like this is a pretty typical sign of dementia - I'd wager that's what it is."
cringe,3cb1j9,Rain12913,-5,Mon Jul 6 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that he must know what a microphone is and how it works. My point is that he might not think that it's a traditional microphone but rather something akin to a mobile phone. I assume this mainly because the design is fundamentally different in three ways from how microphones were ""in his day"".   1. The form is radically different 2. It is hand-held and has no stand 3. Most importantly, it's wireless   What's more, if this man does indeed have dementia then it must be fairly advanced for him to make such a blunder, in which case I would question why he was addressing a large audience in the first place. I know it's only a brief video, but he otherwise seems cogent and lucid when he speaks. I had a Great Aunt who sadly passed away from Alzheimer's and I can tell you that it isn't pretty. It's likely that a person with advanced dementia would hardly be able to string a coherent sentence together, never mind make a public speech from memory. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I think you're jumping the gun here by assuming that's the only logical explanation, and one that doesn't particularly fit the facts either."
cringe,3cb1j9,Carthagefield,3,Mon Jul 6 20:35:09 2015 UTC,"Kind of a funny conversation we're having here, but I guess that's the fun of Reddit.  The microphones in the image you linked may have been what they looked like when this guy was a young person, but remember that his middle adult life was in the 1970's and 80's.  By that time they looked like this, and many of them were wireless (these were invented in the 50's, and were in popular use by the 80's).  The microphone in the video looks pretty similar to what microphones have looked like for the past 30+ years.  For example, here's an example of a speech that this guy most definitely saw (as a Russian) nearly thirty years ago.  Those microphones look nearly identical to the one in the video.  Dementia can be quite complicated.  I'm a clinical psychologist who specializes in other areas, but I've studied dementia a good deal and have done neuropsychological testing with dementia patients.  One of the key features of dementia - particularly dementia related to Alzheimer's - is that it can be very episodic.  Somebody who is capable of eloquently addressing a large audience in one moment might suddenly have a severe episode that renders them unable to even recognize a microphone.  In fact, that's one of the things that makes dementia so difficult for family members to cope with.  It's progression is also not quite as linear as you think, so somebody who has trouble recognizing objects may be perfectly capable of keeping up a quick-witted conversation."
cringe,3cb1j9,Rain12913,-9,Mon Jul 6 23:08:45 2015 UTC,"You've made some good points, and I agree that dementia is certainly a possibility. The thing that I do disagree with is that it is the only explanation possible. Forgive me if this comes across as impertinent, but as a medical professional you should know better than to make such a resounding assertion based on speculative and flimsy evidence. This is Russia for God's sake, stupidity or drunkenness should not be so lightly dismissed."

cringe,3c8ac5,pinata_penis_pump2,-32,Mon Jul 6 15:30:55 2015 UTC,Howard Stern show is just the cringiest shit ever. He tries sooooo hard to be edgy
cringe,3c8ac5,SxeRpw,17,Tue Jul 7 00:54:20 2015 UTC,some of his interviews are great though. I'm not keen on stern but people just seem to be so much more open on his shows. His interviews of Paul McCartney and roger waters for example are probably the best interviews they've done for years imo.

I mean I don't dislike him, but wouldn't exactly call myself a fan.    I didn't want to get out of my car at the end of my commute home after a long day at work.  His interviews are riveting.

They spinned records and didn't inject their own opinion into anything. His dad was one of those DJs. Howard got fired from most of his early jobs, because he couldn't do that deep-voiced radio cadence that was the industry standard. His dad told him he could never make it in radio.     Howard took a format that was boring as hell and started doing ""edgy"" things like treating prostitutes, strippers, gays and lesbians, little people, and people with ""taboo"" sexual interests as just normal folks doing their thing. He was ahead of almost everyone else in all social issues by about 30 years.    Yeah, his show was edgy, by very definition. Radio had become rigid, stale, and boring, and now what we see in all of mass entertainment is a variation of Howard."

So if the people you're only attracted to are out of your league and not interested in you, then that comparison is probably out of whack.  In other words your self-image is probably overinflated.  So you can take yourself down a few pegs and in time you will find people you might not have found very attractive before, attractive.  Or drink a case of beer."

It's his episode, meaning it's just a show and she's not a real judge presiding over a real courtroom.   Yeah, it's embarrassing that he couldn't get a laugh from the audience when he said that. But Judge Judy is without a doubt the crappiest judge I've ever even heard of, and she was asking him questions that were in all probability not even relevant to the case, and doing so for the purpose of prejudicing herself against him. There's a reason why she doesn't preside in a real court of law anymore - real judges do not behave the way she does - or at least they're not supposed to. In theory a judge could be disbarred for making arbitrary rulings based on their prejudices. In practice, a lot of them slip by. (And no, by 'prejudice' I'm not referring to the guy being hispanic. She may or may not be prejudiced against hispanics, but she clearly demonstrates her prejudice against people who have a lot of children with multiple women, which could apply to a lot of white old school mormons just as well, and she'd be very likely to rule against them regardless of the merits of their case)"

When that failed, other neighbors banded together to try to purchase the home that Russell wanted to buy, said Tom Heinsohn, a close friend of Russell’s who played with him from 1956 to 1964. Once, vandals broke into Russell’s home and defecated on his bed. Heinsohn said two white sportswriters from Boston told him they wouldn’t vote Russell the league’s most valuable player because he was black.""  Not only did sportswriters refuse to give him the accolades he deserved but somebody shit on his fucking bed. It's well known that his house in Reading used to get vandalized often.    Putting that aside, Russell obviously was uncomfortable with the way they were talking about him, so even if they disagreed with the racial connotations, it was very rude to keep jabbing at him.

cringe,3c7wsm,FDRhadcrazymoves,5,Tue Jul 7 08:57:02 2015 UTC,"No, because then it just becomes like politics or religion. No one is right and no one is wrong, people have the right to make their own decisions.   Would you actually apply that approach consistently, even in cases where other humans are harmed?  For example, the law currently will use force (even deadly force) to stop people from robbing, raping, killing other people. I would also say that generally, the average person would think that you should interfere if you find one person robbing/raping/killing another. Most moral systems don't consider standing idly by while a moral wrong occurs to be neutral or good.  Even refining your point to ""We should only act to uphold the law"" wouldn't help, because at various places/times it has been legal to treat women as if they are inferior or even keep other humans as slaves. During the time where slavery was legal, should people who believed slavery was morally wrong have simply stood by? Was it wrong if they tried to help slaves escape? I would expect that most people (including yourself) would consider helping slaves escape as a good action.  The point here isn't to compare slavery with eating a burger — the property being compared is that there are and have been people that think both of those things are immoral. If we can reasonably be expected to have a duty to stop wrong things from occurring, even to the point of physically compelling another person to desist their actions then it would be inconsistent to tell vegans that they should stand by while morally wrong things (from their perspective) occur.  In short, the point of contention would be about what things are right and wrong, not that people should ignore morally wrong things."
cringe,3c7wsm,Vulpyne,2,Mon Jul 6 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"At its core, it's not about persuasion rather than information. On many different topics, there's a lot of misinformation going around.  You consider persuading people wrong. Which I understand. However, not a single choice you make is not based on information, of which you haven't - be it in a explicit or implicit fashion- been ""persuaded"".  Think about education, law, morality, marketing, the way you are raised.  What actions like this strive for is adding new perspectives to current debates. Forcing ideas on people is wrong, but when the mainstream ideas, of which we are automatically ""persuaded"" as we're raised into the society of which we are meant to be a part, are so loud that they blur out everything else. I think any attempt to add perspectives (if they are morally grounded) are fine.  Doesn't mean this ain't cringeworthy though, yikes."

cringe,3c7wsm,shitty-photoshopper,4,Sun Jul 5 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"This post is going to be long. Unfortunately it takes a fair amount of verbiage to rebut these points and provide citations to back up my claims. I hope that people will take the time to read through.   The pain is as severe as a paper cut, and the pain subsides within 2 hours. http://www.depts.ttu.edu/animalwelfare/research/pigcastration/   Your link link doesn't say anything about the severity being equivalent to a paper cut. This assertion seems misleading given you followed it up with a link which would imply the citation supports your argument.  The link article also seems somewhat inconsistent when it refers to the duration of pain. First they say:  The post-procedure pain lasts 2 hours or so in piglets and longer in older males.  Then later:  Presented in Figure 1 is a summary of the effects of local anesthesia on nursing behavior in piglets. Castration reduced nursing behavior. This effect was partially reversed by use of local anesthetic. This is evidence that castration is painful during this 3-hour period after castration.  ""2 hours or so"" is relatively vague. At the least, their position doesn't support your assertion that pain subsides within two hours.  I'd also note there are a number of proof reading errors in that article. Some of the images are also broken. That diminishes its credibility. Example:  When male pigs develop sexually (puberty), they develop a natural pheromone and gut product that smell offensive to many people.   We never use anesthesia because there isn't a FDA approved one available for meat pigs.   That certainly seems to indicate a lack of concern for avoiding suffering.    We used to do non-castrated pigs for a while, (private farm) until a pen of 30 frenzied, 12 dead pigs, 3 people were rushed to the ER after injuries. We never did any more non-castrated pigs. Same reason we dock tails. They will bite tails until they are into the spinal cord causing injury/death, paralyze, and severe pain.   You're taking that we must produce pig meat as a given. It's not necessary to do this, so it can't be necessary to castrate them without anesthesia or perform other procedures that would result in suffering or distress.  There are also other methods of addressing those problems such as closer monitoring, not keeping a large number of pigs in a limited space, only grouping compatible individuals together, etc.    Pigs are not nice friendly animals. They are mean, aggressive, and will kill each other easily.   If you shoved 30 random unsocialized dogs into a pen, it's very likely they would fight and injure each other if unsupervised. Especially if you were breeding dogs without regard for temperament. Blaming it on the dogs and saying they are mean and aggressive doesn't seem very fair.    I'll reply to some points in your other post here to save space:   Meat provides nutrients that aren't available in any other place.    That implies meat provides necessary nutrients. This is simply not true at all, and many people can satisfy their nutritional needs without any animal products at all. Most reputable dietary organizations agree on this fact.  It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. [...] Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than non-vegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. — http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826028   Also, calorie for calorie, pork is most economical for the environment than, say broccoli.   That seems like a fairly ridiculous comparison. Broccoli is not a calorie dense food.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_protein_per_unit_area_of_land http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Calories_per_acre_for_various_foods/ (Talking about potatoes) The yield of Calories per acre (about 9.2 million) is higher than that of maize (7.5 million), rice (7.4 million), wheat (3 million), or soybean (2.8 million). — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#genetics   You lose 90% of energy each time you traverse a link in the food chain. If you eat 100 calories worth of pork, the pig must necessarily have eaten roughly 900 calories of food. Except in edge cases (basically where we waste a resource we don't care about), it's extremely wasteful to eat high on the food chain.  The efficiency with which energy or biomass is transferred from one trophic level to the next is called the ecological efficiency. Consumers at each level convert on average only about 10% of the chemical energy in their food to their own organic tissue (the ten-percent law). For this reason, food chains rarely extend for more than 5 or 6 levels. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency  There are also a lot of negative ancillary effects from eating animal products. For example:   Waste production. Land use. Inefficient use of food energy (already covered). Breeding zoonotic diseases. Breeding antibiotic resistant diseases. In 1952, 2 million pounds of antibiotics were produced, by 1998 at least 50 million pounds were produced, about half of which was used for human treatment and about forty percent of which was used in animals, the ""lion's share"" of which was mixed into feed to promote growth. in 2011 80% of antibiotics went to livestock production. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock#United_States Greenhouse gas output, though in fairness this applies less to pigs than cattle. Total emissions from global livestock: 7.1 Gigatonnes of Co2-equiv per year, representing 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions. — http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/    A stressed animal produces DFD or PSE meat which is inferior.    This is misleading. PSE is caused by severe stress just prior to slaughter. DFD is caused by stress in a longer period time period, but generally in the transport/handling prior to slaughter. In short, abusing animals in the weeks/months before they're slaughtered does not cause this effect. Ref: http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6909e/x6909e04.htm   Stressed animals lose weight, lose their appetite, and become more diseased. All of these point to it being in everyone's best financial interest to treat their animals well. Happy pig = fat pig.   It's a lot less straightforward than you imply. It's not like obese humans are always happy, in fact binge eating has some associations with depression. It's not like animals in factory farms have many pleasant activities to choose from aside from eating.   Of course, I'm not saying stress has no effect, but it's more complex than you imply. Also, people frequently take steps to address the symptoms of the issue rather than the underlying cause. Pigs stressed out and fighting? Cut off their teeth, tails, castrate them so they're more docile. In the case of other animals like chickens, confine them to cages so they can't even interact, etc. Factory farming uses a lot of antibiotics to deal with the negative health effects of cramming large amounts of animals into a small space.  I'd say it's pretty hard to look at common factory farming practices like battery cages, gestation pens, CAFOs and say that the animals are happy with a straight face."

Let's look at water needs. Humans use 80-100 gallons of water per person, per day. That's not including the water needed for our food. Cows need 23 gallons per day. To drink. Excluding water for food, that's it.  You use as much water as 5 cows. Every day. And then there's the water that goes into your vegan foods and crops. Producing your clothes if they're made of vegan cotton.  By forgoing steak (remember, no one person eats one whole cow per day), you probably helped save 2.3 gallons of water.

cringe,3c7wsm,--Wasp,3,Wed Jul 8 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"How do these people justify the fact that animals eat other animals? Lions aren't really hunted by humans anymore, and lions kill tons of other animals.    We generally hold humans to a higher moral standard than a lion. The lion also could cite necessity: many humans have alternative means of satisfying their nutritional needs without consuming animal products. The lion doesn't have that option."

cringe,3c7wsm,FercPolo,-4,Sat Jul 11 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"A friend and I became vegetarians around the same time a few years back. I started eating meat around Christmas time last year but still not as much as before, my friend became a full on vegan... I love her to pieces, but fuckin' hell, she's so damn annoying about her newfound veganism. She posts things that makes me mad sometimes because I find that lifestyle to be in such a place of privilege and I grew up poor, eating tons of junk shit but eventually was able to afford much better food.  The last thing she posted was this, I had to unfollow her on FB after reading that (not worth cutting ties with her as friends however.) I'm a gay lady who was born to parents who came from a war-torn country and struggling to fit in a new country/society, so I know what being oppressed is. She's a straight girl from Australia and lived in S. Korea for 5 years as a teacher and is now back in Oz with a brand new motorcycle, finishing her Uni. Love her, but that was the last straw in her extreme attitude."
cringe,3c7wsm,Vulpyne,3,Sun Jul 5 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"I see nothing wrong with this logically. There are very few people in the first world who can't afford or access lentils and beans, they fund cruelty out of sheer laziness and convenience - or worse, because it tastes good."
cringe,3c7wsm,FercPolo,3,Sun Jul 5 23:43:14 2015 UTC,"I find that lifestyle to be in such a place of privilege   It's absolutely true that one must be in a position of privilege (compared to the average person in the world) to make the choice to pick and choose your food based on morals. That doesn't seem like an argument against it to me, though. I mean, if we're in a position of privilege where we can reduce how much we hurt others while being able live our lives shouldn't we? Our privileged position  means we can't justify our harm by citing necessity.   The last thing she posted was this, I had to unfollow her on FB after reading that (not worth cutting ties with her as friends however.) I'm a gay lady who was born to parents who came from a war-torn country and struggling to fit in a new country/society, so I know what being oppressed is.   If you know what being oppressed is, don't you think that makes oppressing others less justified rather than more justified? I can't quite tell what you are taking exception to in that image, but as far as I can see it doesn't imply the person posting it is oppressed.  Perhaps it's because you feel it's comparing something like oppressing gay people with eating a burger, which you don't agree with? If so, here's another way to phrase essentially the same point:  Good, moral people don't stand by and accept things they believe are immoral. Most moral systems consider allowing morally wrong things to be occur to be a wrong in and of itself. To use an example pretty much anyone could agree on, if we find someone being raped, we should stop the rapist even if we must go so far as to apply physical coercion.  The comparison here isn't that rape and eating a burger are the same in every detail, they are things that some people believe are morally wrong. You probably don't really want to argue that moral people should stand by and let immoral things happen, you most likely have a disagreement about which things are moral or immoral."
cringe,3c7wsm,Vulpyne,0,Mon Jul 6 09:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well, you know, people don't tend to worry about what's in their food when it's the only food they've seen that day.  It's only when life is so incredibly easy that we must go out of our way to take issue with foods that offend our sensibilities.  Survival is completely out of the cards for most people's daily lives."
cringe,3c7wsm,newpnate,3,Mon Jul 6 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"It's only when life is so incredibly easy that we must go out of our way to take issue with foods that offend our sensibilities.   This seems strange to me because it appears you're criticizing people for taking steps to avoid actions that harm others even when it's easy to do so.   It is absolutely true that we're lucky and privileged to be in a position where considering such things is an option, but what is the alternative to the harm reduction approach — to take those privileges we are lucky enough to enjoy and spend them in a purely selfish way?  Perhaps I have misinterpreted your position?"

Ironically, one of the co-workers bands hit it petty big.

Impossible to know without more context - who knows, maybe he was just drunk or tripping?  But if he really can't control it, it makes me feel for him.

If they wanted a Christian nation they wouldn't have specifically prohibited the establishment of a state religion, and the Constitution was specifically written with vague language to be reinterpreted and revised in the future because the founders were afraid that if they spelled out the exact rights to be protected, then everything else would be seen as fair game for tyranny.

Since I felt embarrassed I looked them up;   1867 was when the canadian constitution was written and created canada. The British north american act was greatly influenced by the first prime minister, Sir john a macdonald. This was signed by the Queen(edit: Queen Victoria, now you get the inside jokes on r/canada).  We didn't get independance, instead we united under the british giving the french their own province(colony) within canada all under a single parliament. ( if you ever heard of upper and lower canada that's what it referred to) in 1982 the Queen signed the Canada Act and the new amendments to the canadian constitution which included the charter of rights and freedoms.

Not dissing on California, but the history of California only goes back to around 1849, where a lot of the north eastern states go back pre revolution. It may be a disconnect from America because there was nothing local happening around the time of the revolution. Interesting though how people thought of the Civil War which did have local influences in California."

Maybe not as in-depth as the northeast because we did spend time learning about the gold rush and the Spanish missions, but every school spends some time going over local and state history at the expense of other periods. To say that CA would just skip over the formation of the country because CA wasn't around at the time is disingenuous."

Yes he picked those who didn't know the answers and I don't mean this as an insult, but Americans are considered as huge patriots and the thing I don't get is how the hell couldn't they remember these things, I'm sure they watch movies, there are a lot of movies where they mention the independence of America, dates-names etc..my personal opinion is, there is a lot of ignorance going on in America, which is a shame."

cringe,3c25o8,PickyAsshole,23,Sat Jul 4 08:20:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like they're doing an EEG on him. I'm only going by what I know from personal experience with my ex though. They wanted him to stay up all night and go into the center in the morning where they hooked him up (much like this) and ask him to try to sleep - which is when his seizures happen. Also (as you probably know) sleep deprivation is often a big seizure trigger.    So...they have you all hooked up to brain-readers, and when you have the seizure, they can see where in your brain it's occurring and treat accordingly.    Edit: I re-read your comment. I don't know about this guy specifically. I chose this clip because it's one of the few that show the start of the seizure itself. /edit  I'm sorry to hear you've been experiencing seizures. I know they're scary for you, too, just in a different way. That sound he makes right at the start of the episode just strikes terror in my heart. I was ripped out of sleep many many nights by that same sound. It really sucks being so helpless when it's happening, but you just have to know they'll be okay after a bit of time passes.    This woman and her husband always stuck with me. You can hear the fear in her voice, but she's trying very hard to just see him through it. This guy's event goes almost exactly like my ex's, right down to the super loud snoring and following him around the house afterward!"
cringe,3c25o8,OppressedCactus,6,Sat Jul 4 08:25:58 2015 UTC,"Also (as you probably know) sleep deprivation is often a big seizure trigger.

It's as if you see someone struggling so hard (to live even) but they truly cannot do anything to help what they themselves are doing. Either way , thanks for the video(s) , hopefully someone else sees these and learns a little about how powerful  witnessing something like this can be on a person.

cringe,3c25o8,skellious,6,Sat Jul 4 21:22:54 2015 UTC,My friend had a problem with seizures. Basically they are running tests to figure out why he is having seizures or to find out more info. They are most likely depriving him of sleep (my friend was up for 3 days before finally having a seizure) and doing their best to induce a safe seizure. Seizures aren't necessarily that bad. They are more at risk of physical injury than anything else. Like knocking into thinks and falling onto the corner of a fire place (that actually happened). They look scary as fuck though.

cringe,3c25o8,ieffinglovesoup,9,Sat Jul 4 15:05:46 2015 UTC,I don't think they feel anything during the seizure. Most of the pain is afterward (your body is sore and you have headaches sometimes). Many people hurt themselves in a fall if they don't have auras or warning signs and are able to get safe.
cringe,3c25o8,OppressedCactus,4,Sat Jul 4 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"Every muscle in your body tightens up to its maximum, so it looks painful but it's more like you're just forcibly flexing or lifting some serious weight. The only time it really hurts is if you spasm and hit a part of your body on something, that's why they advise to move all furniture out of the way when someone is having a seizure. It's fucking scary because you don't know what you're going to do. If you had some scissors and you were cutting something, gouging a part of your body is a real possibility."

cringe,3c25o8,Havikz,2,Sat Jul 4 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Epileptic here. For the really bad seizures where you go unconscious, yes they hurt really fucking badly after you've woken up. Mine are bad enough that I can hardly move for 2-3 days after having the seizure. Luckily I very rarely have an actual seizure though.  There are also small seizures that my doctor referred to as ""jerks"" (lol) where you retain consciousness but your body just twitches a few times. Those can leave you kinda sore if they happen too often, but usually they don't happen unless you're about to have a really big seizure."

The human brain is nothing more than a computer, and we have no reason to believe that it possesses any special qualities that distinguish it from the sort of computers that we are able to make.

cringe,3c1npr,FelitonC,6,Sat Jul 4 07:38:21 2015 UTC,"""racist blunder"" is an intriguing characterization. It's true that ""gorilla"" is a known racist epithet directed towards dark-skinned people. But does the outcome suggest moral agency of the software? Culpability by the developers? This label was presumable produced by an ensemble of machine-learning technology, trained using training examples obtained somehow. It's possible that the training examples were mischievously labelled, and this was a source of racist intent. Or perhaps to few examples of dark-skinned primates that were not gorillas vs light skinned primates that were humans were included - representing a racial bias, if not racism, in the development of the model. Perhaps the error was not encoding into the model a sense for racism... ""if I'm going to label something as a gorilla, be very certain, because the penalty for getting it wrong is large"". Interesting that the developers solution was to delete the label from the system altogether."

I never understand why when talking about someone people offer their charitable donations as evidence for their moral character or whatever. No amount of money given to charity can make you a good person. Some billionaires pledge their entire fortunes to charity after they die and give cuts elsewhere first. Plus, publicly announcing such a thing is incredibly selfish, enough to to really tarnish any respect one might earn for altruism (and big donations to charity are very far from selfless acts act that!).  It's already bad enough but it gets way worse when you consider how terrible charities are and how shady it can be when someone gives to one. You can give to a charity that you own in a roundabout way. Many charities give little or much less than you'd like of their given money to actual people in need or whatever causes. Heck, one of the biggest charities in the world is about ""awareness"" instead of any kind of treatment, care, or cure research. Even worse, often times money that does reach its intended issue, it's ineffective, wasted, or worse. Good intentions don't mean shit when you do bad things with them. It's not the thought that counts, it's the lives, it's the problems, it's the deaths that matter.   Especially when you're rich enough to give tons of money to charity and be loud about it, you're giving a pittance at that point. You already have more money than you ever need, giving to charity is one way to keep more of it after some contemporary economic wizardry.   Honestly the ancient Christians explained this issue much better than I could through Jesus:   41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: 44 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.   Fuck rich people who think they get a pat on the back for promising to give some of their too-much-money to ""charity"" after they are dead and literally can't do anything with it anymore anyway. Hey man, you're starving, let me give you a meal. Here, you can have this sandwich, after I've eaten it and shit it out. Thanks a fucking lot."

Basically not caring what would happen to a democratic people living in a hostile region."
cringe,3c1akl,oompaloempia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"Basically not caring what would happen to a democratic people living in a hostile region.   Oh, come on. You can't be a ""democratic people"" and not let your neighbour vote because he's from ""another people"". Israel is not a democracy until they let Arabs vote in all elections, not just in municipal elections."
cringe,3c1akl,NorcalHPDE,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:17:06 2015 UTC,Israeli Arabs CAN vote in all elections. Wtf? Are you saying Palestinians should decide who leads Israel?
cringe,3c1akl,oompaloempia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"""Palestinians"" that have been living inside Israel's borders (so not Palestine) for generations should get to decide who leads Israel, yes. Those with Israeli citizenship can vote, but a lot of them don't have citizenship, but ""permanent residency"", which is a similar status except they're not allowed to vote.  No democratic country has that same concept where a family can live inside a country for generations without automatically getting citizenship, or at least an equivalent status where they're allowed to vote. And Israel obviously doesn't want to encourage them to get citizenship, as the parties in power profit from the fact that those people can't vote."

cringe,3bwi2t,gamey117,11,Fri Jul 3 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"Not all are judged. Some are ""friendly"", i.e. The MCs spit their game because they can and people want to hear it. Others are judged by other battlers who award rounds to the MC that did best, and decide their winner from that. So for example if I along with 6 other judges were judging and MC A clashes with MC B, I think MC B does great in round 2 but MC A is a little bit better for rounds 1 and 3, so MC A gets my vote. Based on things like delivery, lyrical complexity, flow, charisma, performance, crowd control, and ultimately just who got the bigger hype from the crowd."
cringe,3bwi2t,veggiter,2,Fri Jul 3 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"ultimately just who got the bigger hype from the crowd     Poor way to judge a battle imo, especially for it to be the main judging point. Crowds often hype up dogshit bars because they sound good at the time or they favour a certain battler."
cringe,3bwi2t,deHavillandDash8Q400,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:29:47 2015 UTC,Never realized there was that many boxes to check. Thought it was just reaction alone. Also Iv noticed that freestyle is the default backup for anyone who chokes. I was under the impression that its all generally freestyle ? Do they all get time to prepare based on the details of their opponent or is it just general verse stuff that they write that could apply to anyone ?
cringe,3bwi2t,Bakshi-zaki,5,Fri Jul 3 01:09:49 2015 UTC,"they have pre-written verses composed of bars that they can mix and match, but generally speaking, a vast majority of their round is pre-written.  sometimes they'll freestyle to show off their skills but they typically announce this beforehand in some way (as you can imagine, this occasionally leads to accusations from their opponent that they had written their supposed freestyle beforehand.)  when you consider the variability of mixing and matching bars, freestyling, and the bars that the battlers come up with on the spot as a response to their opponents rounds, the whole thing becomes very dialectic.  battle rap fans, please jump in if i've misrepresented something  edit: as for the last question, you inadvertently identified the difference between what are known as ""personals"" (bars that refer to the opponent specifically) and more generalized bars.  different battlers have different ways of approaching this; some focus on attacking their opponent's character, while others hype themselves up with complex lyricism and whatnot.  that's a pretty cursory explanation, check out /r/rapbattles if you're curious"
cringe,3bwi2t,SpontaneousDream,2,Fri Jul 3 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Started watching a few of the non-choke versions and its pretty entertaining. I like that its not just a pre-determined verse but that it is the interchangeable pieces you mentioned that they can call upon. I noticed they do sometimes do a ""bar"" based on the other persons specific rhymes/appearance, that has to be 100% freestyle and made up on the spot so do they get mega points for that ?"
cringe,3bwi2t,SanjayManjrekar,5,Fri Jul 3 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"yeah it depends, if it's based on their appearance it's probably freestyled.  however, oftentimes battlers will anticipate their opponent's bars beforehand and flip it back on them with what I personally refer to as a defense bar.  it's sometimes hard to tell what was and wasn't pre-written."

cringe,3bwi2t,DerzDictionZ,2,Fri Jul 3 09:25:05 2015 UTC,"That's a freestyle bar, very often in prewrittens they'll throw them in at the start before transitioning or put one at the end or the middle if they stumble or the crowd fucks them up.  It's very rare that stumbling from writtens into freestyling the rest of a round wins you a round, so it's never really a planned thing in the prewritten era, very few do it. Rebuttals are my favourite type of freestyle though again, they're hard to pull off and can sometimes come across as a prebuttall (essentially a written bar to cover one of your weak points if it comes up -still its nice to see sometimes if done well)."
cringe,3bwi2t,snowfalltranquility,2,Fri Jul 3 09:32:57 2015 UTC,"It's not for sure 100% freestyle, even if the rapper mentions specifics of his opponent. Consider this line:  ""Spittin' hot flames for you all to see Leave this dude burnin' in that Ice Cube tee""  A skilled freestyler may have a few rhymes like this memorized, and simply replace ""Ice Cube"" with ""Walmart"" or ""raggedy-ass"" as needed. Since the improv part of the line is not being rhymed, you can go into the battle with that template memorized and not have to worry about making your improv also rhyme."

Because generally when a country exports a lot of products to another, the exporter makes a lot of money and in doing so it is raising their dollar value. Do this enough and eventually the dollar value is too high for other countries to buy more.  So before it was 1us dollar for 35rmb. Now it's 6 us dollar for 35rmb.  But the Chinese government and their version of the federal reserve just print more money each year.  The more money you print and have in circulation the lower its  value.   They are essentially causing deflation of their own currency, good for other countries to buy from them. Bad for the people in China.   Say you spend 10 years saving 100k . Fantastic. But now that 100k only has the buying power of 50k because of this devaluing move. Shit house.  Don't get me wrong trump is a complete fuck knuckle but this is what he is talking about."

cringe,3btdhp,compute_,21,Thu Jul 2 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"As a rebuttal, I think you're missing the point of why the ""binders full of women"" thing was offensive. Basically saying, ""no, I want a woman here instead of the people who applied"" screams of tokenism, which is NOT what feminists want (I mean... not the crazy third wave feminists because nobody knows what the hell they want). Liberals/feminists, in general, would like a woman or a man to be equally eligible for the same job with the same experience and background, that's it. They don't want some heroic boss saying, ""fetch me some women to put here, I grow so tired of men I dare say!""  And by saying ""we found binders full of women"" it seems like he really wasn't after the best candidate, not even the best female candidate, just A female candidate.  At least, that's why I thought people found it offensive. I don't really care about these stupid soundbites that get thrown around unless they're truly damning. The only one like that, in my opinion, was when Romney was asked about viscuously bullying some guy for being gay and Romney just laughed and said he doesn't remember. That soundbite is what disturbed me the most and it wasn't shared that much. If you are accused of throwing someone to the ground and forcibly cutting their hair off while they scream for help, the proper reaction is NEITHER to laugh or to say you don't remember. That's not what human beings do. I would absolutely remember if I did something that horrendous in high school and if someone asked me about it, I'd feel enough shame not to laugh about it like ""oh boys will be psycho homophobic boys, haha!""  That betrayed something really horrible in Romney and something that he has yet to fix based on his reaction and people didn't talk about it that much at all."

They did something heinous, ineffective, and completely unAmerican and bastardized American principles to get it done. John Oliver did a great segment on torture. IIRC, there was a mention of how effective good negotiators can be, and this other great one mentions how important it is to protect people who work with our military when doing that can get your family butchered. If the US gets a reputation as a safe military to work with, getting good intel from locals and finding translators who will help will be much easier and safer for everyone involved."

So blatantly chopped up and edited that it's just an insult to your intelligence sitting through it. It's the closest we've got to the over the top/set up reality shows that you see in the US. Most shows here are quite genuine, but Britains Got Talent is fake through and through.. From talent scouts hunting down people months in advance of the auditions (also hunting down weirdos just to be put on stage and laughed at) to a switched performing dog during the final, the winning act no less. The whole show is completely contrived."

Right down to editing a judge taking notes into a judge smiling at an act. It's all fake, judge reactions, crowd reactions, sounds, etc."

You can't argue that Bin Laden isn't a mythical figure, because the word has multiple layers of meaning and doesn't have to be taken literally.  Maybe Hitchens was confusing it with the definition of mythological.  -1.   I dont speak Arabic and I don't trust the media...   So he doesn't trust the video in question.  He knows that translations can be manipulated, and maybe he knows that videos can be manipulated.   2.    We can agree to disagree.   His point is that the nature of the argument is subjective due to a lack of objective proof.  Hitchens is angry because Mos Def doesn't agree and is attacking his conclusion rather than his reasoning.  There is no argument here- simply ad hominem.  But Hitchens has the popularity of his conclusion on his side.  -3   You pretend to know something about me. Don't pretend to know me because you don't   a response to Hitchens' trying to simplify Mos Def's argument based on how he sees other arguments that he views as similar.

The video we're talking about, Bin Laden looks nothing like he did in other videos, and it was found and translated by SITE.  There is also a section of the video which is only audio.  And let's remember that the CIA ADMITS to creating their own fake bin laden video (because he's a myth).   It really isn't.

Every time you open your mouth you are going to be judged to some extent.  Hiding behind having the ability to formulate an opinion and then telling the world to shut up when they tell you you're an idiot is nothing more than a tantrum.

This is a big part of the reason that many (but not all) people begin to listen and care less about the latest, hottest music and listen to more from their teens and 20s. Part of that is nostalgia, and part of it is that the latest music just simply doesn't ""speak our language"" anymore.

He's probably the most popular hiphop artists right now to be putting out some really ""deep"" music.  50 Cent, just watch some interviews with him and see how level headed and wise he sounds, the dudes made so much money (same with Jay Z) it's hard to ignore their obvious intelligence.  Vince Staples, I don't always completely agree with him, but the dude brings a real intelligence to the gangster side of hiphop. again his interviews are really good and same with his music.  just a couple I can think of, there are hundreds more and probably a lot more behind the scenes.

There's a reason they're paying Harbaugh a ton of money to fix it.  Then he had nothing but nice things to say about Harbaugh.  He said he was very successful in the NFL and a lot of other NFL teams would be happy to have him.  Cowherd was wrong about whether Harbaugh would want to go to Michigan, but that's nothing to be offended by."

Honestly, it felt like he was just uncomfortable and once it became obvious it was going wrong, he just stopped talking."
cringe,3brke7,Lord_Varys,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"Starting with ""are you ever not intense?"" is weird but forgivable.  The buy/bye was poorly phrased but they worked through it.  All other answers were short and made for a bad interview.  When Harbaugh was surprised that Colin was asking so many questions, and when he mockingly asked if Colin really was a good WR.. that is when the interview went from bad to terrible.  Then Colin hanging up just secured the cringe.  Not his fault though.  Some of the bumps in the road were his fault; the train wreck was all on Harbaugh."

Sadly they aren't on talking terms these past few years.
cringe,3bo3tu,Mankay,74,Tue Jun 30 20:52:50 2015 UTC,Why aren't they on talking terms? Didn't this guy basically teach Ramsay everything.
cringe,3bo3tu,BoboMatrix,92,Tue Jun 30 21:13:57 2015 UTC,I haven't looked up on the story in a while and there are numerous things that put a major wedge between them but the most famous story I can think of is when Ramsay stole the guest list? at one of Marco's Restaurant. I believe it was some sort of payback or cutthroat competition on who will be the next head chef of a new restaurant. You'll definitely want to look it up because I'm proof reading what i just wrote and doesn't make the slightest of sense. lol
cringe,3bo3tu,Mankay,112,Tue Jun 30 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"I think the relationship really started to divide when Ramsay went out on his own. Ramsay is a very, very competitive person and stated that he always wanted to do better than Marco and had tried to best him at nearly every aspect of their careers. I mean who doesn't want to achieve more than their massively successful head chef right? Ramsay achieved in his career more than what Marco has (Ramsay was more in it for fame than Marco was too) but at the end of the day people still see Ramsay as Marcos student"

cringe,3bo3tu,Skatesafe,38,Wed Jul 1 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"Isn't that incredibly arrogant?  Michelin stars are awarded to the restaurant, not to the head chef.  He's basically saying ""the Michelin star was all my doing"".  Probably just a publicity stunt, playing up his image."

I think he's trying to catch up to Ramsay as far as television presence goes, but he'll never be as entertaining. Marco will never beat Gordon at television."
cringe,3bo3tu,Mankay,24,Wed Jul 1 04:22:26 2015 UTC,Found this. Confirms your paragraph  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55B4nJxoUwQ
cringe,3bo3tu,Bamont,21,Wed Jul 1 02:44:50 2015 UTC,"You summed it up nicely.  To be more specific: Gordon took a sabbatical from the kitchen and became a private chef. When he expressed a desire to return to the kitchen, Marco--along with some investors he knew--started a restaurant called Aubergines. Even though Gordon had some minimal equity in the company, the real issue was about the Michelin stars.   The Michelin star that Gordon received while working at Aubergines belonged to the restaurant, not to him. When Gordon realized any stars he received while working there wouldn't be his, he arranged for the reservation book to be stolen - which, in the world of fine dining, is like sounding the death bell. Without a reservation book, the restaurant simply couldn't operate. It was at this point that Gordon, funded in large part by his wife's father, struck out on his own and opened Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. It was here he would receive his first three Michelin stars.   If you've never watched the documentary Boiling Point, I strongly suggest taking a few hours out of your day to do so. Gordon was literally obsessed with becoming the youngest chef to receive three Michelin stars; so obsessed that he missed the birth of Jack and Holly (his twins) due to a dinner service where he thought a Michelin star judge might be present.   Marco--and most everyone else--was unaware that it had been Gordon who stole the reservation book. The two remained friends for some time (with Marco even offering to give up his Michelin stars in protest of Gordon not receiving his third), but the relationship slowly broke down over the course of several years. Ramsay finally admitted in an interview a few years ago that he had been the one who orchestrated the Great Reservation Book Heist.

After you see Gordon actually mad about something he cares about and not just for shock value, you realize just how dramatized his newer shows are. The guy literally fired someone on the spot for drinking water because it could have reflected poorly on his restaurant."
cringe,3bo3tu,SkyB4se,8,Wed Jul 1 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"I think people underestimate how driven Gordon was to get those Michelin stars. The majority of Americans were exposed to him via Hell's Kitchen, after he'd already achieved some success in the UK (both with his stars and shows like The F Word and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares).   Personally, seeing Chef Ramsay now--as an older, much wiser chef--is a lot more refreshing than seeing him back in his Boiling Point days. I felt bad for him, because his success seemed more valuable than his family - something he's expressed a bit of regret over."

They were never able to identify who it was (even with a private investigator,) but Ramsay had the suspicion it was Marco.  Ramsay also did a dick move by showing up to Marco's wedding with a camera crew. He mentions what strained their relationship in detail in ""Roasting in Hell's Kitchen"" which is a really interesting read, especially for aspiring young chefs."

It got to the point where he could no longer overlook Marco's views on cuisine bloodlines, as people who couldn't cook and even chefs who were not of a pure-blooded chef line were being slaughtered.   Ramsey duelled him until Marco was too weak to resist, and was imprisoned."

Short back story: I was a young chef working in a pub kitchen, when Marco bought our establishment. It was one of his many gastro pubs at the time. I was part of a team of 7 chefs. My head chef was a 21 year old who had worked with Marco at his flagship pub for years. We were all very young, and we had to learn hard and fast. I know that a lot of chefs claim there job is hard, but trust me, this was on another level. To go from cooking burgers and pies to literally cooking dishes which have won stars and rosettes was insane. We would see Marco once a week, twice if he was in the area for shooting. He was an insanely tall and scary man. But if he came in with a smile on his face, you knew it would be a good day. He would walk around checking everybodies prep, and if you were unsure of anything, all you had to do was ask the best way. He's a brilliant man, who I have nothing but respect for"

It was called the Whoosh.  Here’s how it worked. A phalanx of waiters would swoop in on the offending table and clear away everything, including half-filled wine bottles, in a moment or two.

Michelin Guide book. It is so interesting how this guide book can create/destroy restaurants and people's live. If you are interested there is a documentary called Michelin Stars The madness of Perfection on youtube that aptly describes the life of a high level chef. Marco and Marco's mentors are on there.

If he's only performing for people who already know and like his music, then that's kind of an egotistical thing to do, and from reading about him (briefly) I don't get the impression that he would have that attitude."

A society where brothers murder each other and even the authority lacks any sympathy for the innocent. It's about prevailing in a chaotic society where both authority and people are clashing."

Him struggling with asthma makes his breathing very hard to control live. Sing About Me, Im Dying of Thirst is arguably his best song. It shows off his incredible story telling (rapping in the perspective of 3 people in 1 song) while still maintaining a beautiful rhyme scheme/flow. The song you heard live was from his newest album which is a LOT harder to get into if your not a fan of rap and jazz. While harder to get into its still an amazing album. His rhymes never drop and his storytelling is still A1. Start off with Good Kid Madd City then move into To Pimp A Butterfly. If you can't get enough go to Section 80 after."

cringe,3bom7f,liquidm,4,Wed Jul 1 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"Restore Pride In Parenting; End Child Abuse & Neglect  Victims of Horrific Child Abuse; Young American Kendrick Lamar Boldly Speaks About Child Abuse, The Seeds of Poverty and Crime  In his 2015 Grammy award winning Rap Performance titled ""I"", Kendrick Lamar writes, ""I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent.""  During a January 20, 2011 LAWeekly interview (Google search) Kendrick, born in 1987, the same year songwriter Suzanne Vega wrote a song about child abuse and VICTIM DENIAL that was nominated for a Grammy award, he told the interviewer:  ""Lamar's parents moved from Chicago to Compton in 1984 with all of $500 in their pockets. ""My mom's one of 13 [THIRTEEN] siblings, and they all got SIX kids, and till I was 13 everybody was in Compton,"" he says.""  ""I'm 6 years old, seein' my uncles playing with shotguns, sellin' dope in front of the apartment. My moms and pops never said nothing, 'cause they were young and living wild, too. I got about 15 stories like 'Average Joe.'""  It seems evident to me Kendrick identified the source of his depression, the roots of poverty, the child abuse/maltreatment that prevented him, his brothers, sisters, cousins, neighborhood friends and elementary and JHS classmates from enjoying a fairly happy, safe Average Joe and Josie American kid childhood.  Seems the adults responsible for raising the children in Kendrick's immediate and extended family placed obstacles in their children's way, causing their kids to deal with challenges and stresses young minds are not prepared to deal with...nor should they or any other children be exposed to and have to deal with.  It seems evident to me these PARENTAL INTRODUCED obstacles and challenges cause some developing children's minds to become tormented and go haywire, not knowing OR NOT CARING ABOUT right from wrong...because as the mature, young victims of child abuse realize their parents introduced them to a life of pain and struggle, totally unlike the mostly safe, happy life the media showed them many American kids were enjoying. RESENTMENT  I cannot speak for anyone else, but if I was raised in Kendrick's family I would most likely be silently peeved at my parents for being immature irresponsible ""living wild"" adults who deprived me of a safe, happy childhood.   Though like many victims of child abuse, most likely I would deny my parents harmed me, seeking to blame others for the pain my parents caused to me.  I wonder how little Kendrick and his classmates reacted when their elementary school teacher introduced the DARE presenter and they learned about the real dangers of drugs and how they harm people, including their parents?  In a Oct 25, 2012, LAWeekly interview (Google search) Kendrick talks about being a SIX-YEAR-OLD child who was not able to trust and rely on his mom...essentially he speaks about being emotionally abandon by his own mom.  Kendrick shares his experiences about feeling lonely, which if you read up on Cognitive Dissonance that Dr. Joy Degruy writes about in her book, ""Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome: America's Legacy of Enduring Injury and Healing (PTSS)"", is it perfectly understandable why Kendrick feels lonely.   Search Google ""Post traumatic Disorder Dr Joy de Gruy Leary - YouTube"" to watch a very disturbing yet enlightening 1:21:00 lecture about ""Cognitive Dissonance"" and how it harms developing kids like Kendrick. Dr. DeGruy does an excellent job describing how ""CD"" helped perpetuate the human ignorances we call racism and slavery.   Dr. DeGruy also describes how using our common sense, we should be able to understand how ""CD"" can negatively impact developing children like Kendrick Lamar (born 1987), as well as Tupac Shakur (born 1971) and Shawn 'Jay Z Carter' (born 1969), to name a few more victims of horrific child abuse.  Early in my police career when I was assigned to the Brooklyn community Shawn 'Jay Z' Carter raps/writes about attempting destroy by selling poison to people living and working in his community, and rapping about engaging in extremely harmful anti-social behaviors designed to protect his drug operation from rival gangs in adjoining neighborhoods, a few of my training officers advised me to be prepared to experience ""culture shock.""   I did find out what ""culture shock"" is, though it was not a culture of violence and harmful anti-social activities many were insinuating I would be shocked by.  The aspect of this Brooklyn, NY community that shocked me to the core was witnessing children being emotionally scarred by a ""American Sub-Culture of Child Abuse/Neglect"" that Kendrick Lamar raps and speaks about some twenty-five years after I first witnessed the  ""American Sub-Culture of Child Abuse/Neglect"" that today CONTINUES emotionally damaging many developing children and their communities.  I personally witnessed the emotional trauma and physical pain a young, neglected, unsupervised, Shawn 'Jay Z' Carter is responsible for causing, and its aftermath, leaving a community populated by mostly peaceful people fearing for their safety on a 24/7 basis, which are the hours Shawn's crew/gang were selling community harming substances.  During the twelve years I served this community I met hundreds of peaceful people who were just as shaken, upset and deeply disturbed as I was by the daily displays of violence and other anti-social activities mostly caused by teens and adults who were victims of childhood abuse and neglect.  I was lucky, at the end of my workday I could leave the community, returning to a more peaceful residential community were concerns for me and my family's safety were significantly lower.  However, virtually all of my civilian co-workers, mostly loving, competent moms living in this community were not as fortunate. They were burdened with stresses and challenges my parents did not face to any significant degree.  The added stresses and challenges my peaceful co-workers faced was preventing their children from being negatively influenced by abused/neglected/unsupervised children being raised and nurtured by immature, ""living wild"" teen moms and young women who irresponsibly begin building families before they acquired the skills, maturity, PATIENCE and means to independently provide for their family of developing children.  Reading Kendrick's background, if you have any compassion for kids, you have to feel horrible for a FIRST GRADE school child who can't depend on his mom to be there for him, a mom who exposes him to things kids should not have to witness and deal with in their young minds.  Kendrick has taken a bold first step by revealing his mother (and father) made poor choices that deprived him, his brothers and sisters from experiencing a safe, fairly happy Average Joe or Josie American kid childhood...YET NO ONE IS LISTENING TO KENDRICK....WHY?  #protect-kids-from-irresponsible-caregivers"

Not cops tackling an unarmed man for selling cigarettes and causing the man a heart attack. Not the cop in North Charleston that shot a man because of a traffic stop. Hip hop.  Now, full disclosure, I don't like hip hop, and I'm becoming sick of all the ""ghetto"" stuff. It was getting old when I was in high school over a decade ago, and it's well past its expiration point now. I also tend to agree with Geraldo that lyrics seeming to glorify the murder of cops (I don't know the full song) are not helpful.  But ""songs"" like these aren't the problem. Systematic racism is the problem, and yammering useful idiots like this are avoiding the issue by focusing on Adele.  Edit: ""Uh oh - a nuanced opinion! Better hit the down vote button!"""

cringe,3bl9dp,lelANDtoplel,11,Tue Jun 30 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"Much like Survivor, people get voted out, the jury of evictees votes for the winner, lying and manipulation.   BB lasts 90 days where as Survivor typically lasts 39. BB is more mental (being trapped in a house for 90 days with nowhere to go) where as Survivor is a bit more physical (swimming, sleeping on bamboo, no showers). But they are both games of strategy, imo some of the most entertaining television on TV because its about as real as a reality show can be."
cringe,3bl9dp,lagann-_-,-16,Tue Jun 30 07:47:11 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with finding it entertaining but don't kid yourself that it's not mostly scripted.
cringe,3bl9dp,Evil-Imp,25,Tue Jun 30 08:33:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's ""cleverly editted"" rather than ""scripted""."
cringe,3bl9dp,lelANDtoplel,8,Tue Jun 30 14:01:22 2015 UTC,"The only segments in these shows that have the potential to be scripted are the interviews with the producers. Generally the production team will ask questions that will give the answers they are looking for.  There have been many winners that made bad TV on these shows, who the audience didn't like to begin with. Survivor Borneo winner for example. If the show was scripted the other finalist should have won that season."
cringe,3bl9dp,aweinz,6,Tue Jun 30 17:38:35 2015 UTC,It's not scripted. You can go online and watch live camera feeds 24/7. The only time they're instructed to say something is when one house guest is hosting a competition.
cringe,3bl9dp,TheMightySloth,2,Tue Jun 30 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"The Australian one is pretty bad. They cancelled the live feeds, and past winners have been told what to say or do."
cringe,3bl9dp,Firate,3,Tue Jun 30 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"I hate when people assume that just because Big Brother is a reality show that it's fake and scripted.  The houseguests are locked in that house for 98 days (or until they're evicted), and you can monitor their actions 24/7 with the live feeds, so it's impossible for the producers to guide their every move when the audience is allowed constant surveillance.  As someone else said, the only time it could be mildly scripted is in their confessionals, where they'll be asked questions and the producers might be looking for a certain answer, or the producers will ask them to repeat a line with a different tone. But to call the entire show mostly scripted shows you didn't even try to research the show before spouting your opinion."
cringe,3bl9dp,Firate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:15:35 2015 UTC,"I know this is late, but to explain it in more depth, yes a short description is that it's almost like a combination of The Real World and Survivor.  So a group of strangers is locked away in the house for ~90 days. They are cut off from technology and contact with the outside world (no internet, phones, tv, etc.), and a bunch of cameras and microphones watch over them 24/7 (there's no privacy, there's even a camera in the bathroom).   There's a ""twist"" to the game every year, but in the pure game, there's a competition to win Head of Household. The winner is safe from eviction, and must nominate two fellow houseguests for eviction. Then they play a Power of Veto competition where the winner can nullify someone's nomination, or choose to keep the nominations the same; if the nomination is changed, the Head of Household names the replacement nominee. Then, the houseguests vote to evict one of their own in privacy (only the two nominees and the HOH cannot vote). Once this person is evicted, the cycle begins again with a new HOH, POV, and eviction.   It's interesting because it's the same process each week, but with one less person. And the show is so fascinating to watch how these people try to out-strategize each other, how they form alliances, lie, betray, persuade, etc.   And what really sells me is the 24/7 live feeds where you can watch them any time. That way you know for sure the game is real."
cringe,3bl9dp,tswaves,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:02:26 2015 UTC,cameras in the bathroom   Wtf? Is that legal? Do they sign a waiver for nudity? Fuck that.
cringe,3bl9dp,Firate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"They fully know that they have no privacy.  There's a camera in the bathroom because sometimes, for example, someone will cry in the bathroom and someone will sit with them and console them. You can't have any communication that's not recorded in that house, which is why cameras have to be everywhere."
cringe,3bl9dp,Shyt-Just-Got-Real,9,Fri Jul 3 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"It's not officially cringe, its just a brainfart. If you have a girlfriend/wife you often end conversations with ""love you too"", and then your brain gets wired to end conversations that way automatically. I've almost accidentally said that to people on the phone who were not my girlfriend, like a male construction worker.  Also things could be much worse: I usually grab my girlfriend's ass when I hug her, and I don't really hug other people often, but when I do I have to remember to not do that. Long story short, I almost grabbed my female cousin's ass out of instinct."

cringe,3bj216,hamfraigaar,34,Mon Jun 29 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that at all, but Shatner kept going and going and going. The director was putty in his hands. He backed down, told him to do it Shatners way, said sorry, knew he was wrong, sucked up to the professional, learned from his own mistake, he tried everything and just wanted to continue. He had been taught his lesson. I didn't mind that Shatner teased him a bit. He was right, so he was okay to take the boy to school. But there's a line and Shatner eventually crossed it."

Shatner, im sure, has to turn down hundreds of projects that pay very well every week. Only choosing the ones that most benefit his brand.  I would be very irritated if the one project I chose out of a hundred others turned out to be an unprofessional mess.  Not to mention you are now bound by contract to finish the gig even though you could be doing something else to better promote your career.  Shatner doesn't need money. He needs publicity."
cringe,3bj216,MirrorPuncher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:52:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how any of what you said justifies what he did in the video. I agree that he is bound by contract to finish the gig, but it doesn't seem like he is trying to do his job, rather have a huge ego trip and bash the director for his personal amusement. The director already apologized a bunch of times but he kept mocking him instead of just doing his job. I agree that it was an unprofessional mess, but that was because of Shatner."
cringe,3bj216,KevinMorganOfficial,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"Shatner did it right the first time. The director insisted it was wrong and when confronted by Shatner to show him how, the director could not deliver.  Some people believe it or not, value their time."
cringe,3bj216,MirrorPuncher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:35:55 2015 UTC,What is this nonsense? Some people value their time? Did Shatner value his time when he chose to continue to berate a director that was practically begging him to forgive his mistake and move on with the project? He took a little thing the director said and blown it up like a child as an excuse to bully the director. That's not what someone who values their time would do.
cringe,3bj216,KevinMorganOfficial,-1,Tue Jun 30 08:01:38 2015 UTC,"Actually it is, because I'm pretty sure that director isn't gonna make any more mistakes.  Then again, this is all just my own personal opinion from working in studios with professional people and amateur people."

I don't care if it's the motherfucking Queen of England. If someone is so full of himself that he isn't even able to sit in the booth for 30 seconds and go over ONE line without ripping the closest amateur's head off, then that is by definition an unprofessional actor. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that someone's fuse could be THAT short - I've had projects with not-so-good actors where we had to record every line 30 times. So, really, you are gonna freak out because the director, who is probably paying you thousands of dollars, asked you nicely to do a second take? Oh god, I am William Shatner and the 20 seconds of effort I put into this guy's project felt like too much work for me, so I'm just gonna sit here and make fun of someone who has to bust his ass and makes 100 times less money than me."

Having acted and directed a bit myself, I don't consider it a very constructive tool.  Director was right, the first one was a little relaxed, Shatner's scoffs were uncalled for.  Second one was good, just a little bit fast.  The director's reading was awful.  Bringing the director's abuse of drugs into the conversation is petty and defensive.  I love Shatner, but he's a bit of a knob from time to time."

Shatner's backhanded sarcasm started out fine, but then just went on and on and dragged it out (where the cringe really comes in) which made him look like someone who can't take the slightest bit of constructive criticism, especially if it's coming from someone relatively low on the directorial totem pole.  Also, just because the director couldn't actually ""voice"" it better than Shatner himself, doesn't mean that what he wanted out of him on the second take was wrong."

I realized it wasn't and said ""Oh, I just realized it was correct. I'm sorry!""  He dragged it out though. He put me on the spot in front of the whole class saying something like: ""No, no. You said it was wrong. Please, jaayyne, point out to me where I got it wrong.""  In reality it may have only carried on for like a minute or so but it felt like an hour. I got very choked up, teary-eyed, and just kept saying ""No, it's okay, I'm sorry"" over and over.   After he couldn't hear me any more because I was saying it so quietly he finally stopped and just continued teaching like nothing had happened. Worst day ever."
cringe,3bj216,jbaker1225,5,Tue Jun 30 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"As a writer who often directs voice talent, it's clear that many of you defending Shatner have little clue how these things usually go. If Shatner thought he was going to go in and knock this thing out in one take, then he shouldn't have bothered taking the job.    It is often pretty hard to direct a professional voice actor, because different terms can mean different things to a different actor. If I say ""be more excited,"" one actor might take that to mean ""be louder,"" while another might take that to mean ""be faster."" But we also try our hardest to avoid giving actors line-reads, which this guy didn't do until Shatner specifically asked for a line-read so that he could make fun of the guy after only two takes.    The director might not have been perfectly clear and constructive in his feedback, but Shatner laughs in the dude's face after ONE TAKE when the guy asks for him to read with ""more excitement."" The whole thing was just INCREDIBLY unprofessional on Shatner's part. If you're confused by the feedback, ask for clarification. If you don't want to work, then don't take the job. I've had sessions where we knock something out in 3 takes, and I've had sessions where it takes 20 or more takes. That's the nature of the job. Sometimes you want something different. Sometimes you want to play around and try some things.    Luckily, I've never had to work with anybody as difficult as this. I've worked with some bad voice actors, but none that treated me as if I were less than human."
cringe,3bj216,AnotherPint,2,Tue Jun 30 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"What you said. I too have written for and directed voice talent and occasionally get in front of the mike myself, but prefer to direct. Some years ago I had the pleasure of directing marathon sessions with Russell Johnson, best known as the Professor on ""Gilligan's Island,"" who was charming and collaborative and easy to work with. We were producing a long interactive industrial for CD-ROM (that'll date the story) and punching the right syllables and mapping the cross-references in copy was a job and a half. Johnson couldn't have been nicer about the laborious gig and during breaks told us some great William Shatner stories (they'd come up at the same time; both did ""Twilight Zones,"" etc.). The succinct word was that Shatner is an extremely difficult personality. I wouldn't want to get into it with the Shat, especially if the deliverable was more than a :30 spot.  PS The OP Shat tape is legendary and was kicking around production studios, lovingly copied and recopied, for years before the Internet."

Instead of talking to Shatner, he condescended to him with vague requests and accusatory jabs.  It's a very bad director whenever their actor puts honest effort into a take and they then accuse their actor of not being serious.  That's absurd (not to mention Bill's re-take was pitch-perfect).  At that point, he lost Bill for the rest of the shoot, and even then, it's completely up to Bill on how long he wants to prolong his sarcastic torture (The director already stated he had the takes he needed, so the shoot was over as far as Bill was concerned).  The director's act was at the very least unprofessional, and to Bill, unforgivable."
cringe,3bj216,bunnymud,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"The director was in the wrong here. Any director worth their salt will tell you that you NEVER act out a line as a way to give notes to your talent. A good director should be able to communicate their vision/idea with simple concise words, and they should be able to do it respectfully. Also, you should always compliment at least something about the take before giving your notes. It was so clear that when Shatner suggested the director try it out himself, that he was annoyed. The thing to do there is to diffuse the tension, not fucking escalate it further by actually acting it out......"

cringe,3bgbx3,PlumsweetSoda,17,Mon Jun 29 04:11:51 2015 UTC,Some might argue having millions of people around the world see you humiliated on national television might not be worth that money. Especially in today's viral video age where news travels instantly. It's not unusual for guests to be paid for interviews like this either and I doubt she knew exactly what she was getting into. She probably thought it'd be a chance to clear her name and explain herself.

cringe,3bgbx3,Xanza,15,Mon Jun 29 06:29:12 2015 UTC,"I also read that they paid her $45,000 to do the interview (ethically dubious), so the goal was obviously to totally obliterate her for entertainment/rating purposes.   Not necessarily true. They're a news outlet. They get paid to report the news. This story was obviously popular and if they don't report on it someone else will. Ratings mean money. It's perfectly acceptable to pay to get an interview--doesn't mean they did it just to discredit or destroy her public image. They did it for the money that is a result of discrediting and destroying her public image."
cringe,3bgbx3,lazespud2,3,Mon Jun 29 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly acceptable to pay to get an interview   You definitely are not from the United States, are you? In many parts of the world (such as the UK) paying for interviews is common. But it absolutely is not true in the US.  (Many Americans might be confused because this aired on the popular ""60 Minutes"" program; but this is the Aussie version of the show and is not connected to the US version).  Some shows in the US have attempted to get around the whole ""we don't pay for interviews"" restrictions by doing things like paying for rights to shows home movies or photos of the interview subject. So while the interview technically isn't paid for, the person earns 50 to 100k for ""rights"" to something that ordinarily would have been provided for free or a nominal amount.  But even in those cases the new outlet typically gets hammered when the truth comes out.  I don't necessarily disagree with you; getting paid for an interview doesn't necessarily mean the interview isn't valuable or should be discredited. It's just a major, major taboo in American media."

Everyone is dishonest in small amounts(""I'll just try this one little grape""""I'll just spend another minute on my work break""), and you subconsciously measure that level of dishonesty with the environment and people around you. It's how politicians can end up taking large sums of money dishonestly and think that it's okay, everyone around them is doing it, so it must be okay.  And not only this but people will often increase their level of dishonest behaviour over time, because what is one more extra grape or one more extra minute on break?  And so you continue to up the stakes over time, and it makes sense to you because the bar was here, and what's the problem with increasing the bar just a tinny amount to here, and suddenly you are lying about cancer because everyone exaggerates being sick to skip work or to raise a little charity for themselves.

She's not particularly talented in any way, she isn't educated formally nor is she a great scholar.   She has definitely got the ""It Girl"" factor though, which is like watching a trainwreck: you can't look away.  Even among people like myself (who really do not like the Kardashians in the least), I somehow find myself in the know about their more popular going's on without really engaging interest in them directly.  Furthermore, all of the Kardashians seem to understand that their popularity is not limited by those hating them--they're perfectly fine with taking any attention they can.  It's also rather brilliant that they've made their lives into caricatures in which they play out on their show.  So much of it is scripted but they sell it like it's all real! They aren't the first to do this but the Kardashians' are probably some of the best at it.  That's where the genius really comes in. I don't think it's because any of them are great business people in a technical sense but they've all got that ambition to not be ignored and to be everywhere, whether you like it or not.  So far it has worked very well in their favor."

But come on. Her family is rich, she has a show, got famous because of a sex tape.  I think while it is hard to judge and say who 'deserved' it more, you can definitely make the statement that people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are better role models in terms of how they got to the top than say Kim Kardashian."

cringe,3bj5mp,whorunit,8,Mon Jun 29 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"At this point in Floyd's career, it's kind of BS to ask him to move up to his 6th weight class to fight GGG. Floyd started fighting at 130 lbs. I mean, I would like to see the fight (I think Floyd would still win) but it's understandable the 38 yo Floyd doesn't want to move up. Floyd can probably squeeze 3-4 more fight out at at least $100 million a pop (if not more). Financially it doesn't make sense to take the risk. It's more of a shrewd business decision on Floyd's part. If it were you or I, would you risk ~$400 million at this point in your career ? If he loses, the paydays go away. I can't argue if you want to call him scared ect., I personally just don't look at it that way."

cringe,3bj5mp,whorunit,-1,Tue Jun 30 06:26:54 2015 UTC,Ah you're right. Didn't realize that. Still I stand by the risk/reward point. Calling Floyd scared for not fighting him is completely fair. Can't really argue with it. But I don't blame him for choosing not to fight when that kind of $$$ is involved. Clearly ppl are willing to pay up to watch him fight anyone. Would love to see it though.

Rather than engage with people they tried to ruin the site for everyone else. Those bitter losers even went into completely unrelated subreddits to complain (and by ""complain"" I mean ""demonize Ellen Pao, blame 'SJWs' for ruining the site, and spewing vitriol at fat people""). If somebody disagreed with them they would accuse that person of being fat (because only a fat person can disagree with FPH, I guess) and mass downvote their posts.  I love how you think my judgment is ""clouded"" because I have the audacity to criticize and make fun of a hate group. It's a classic Reddit move: when all else fails, accuse the other side of acting illogically/irrationally. That tired tactic is beneath you.  This is not a free speech issue.

cringe,3bh7tx,nyguyen,-21,Thu Jul 2 13:28:08 2015 UTC,"Then why did slave states fight for the Union if it had to be actively defended? From Lincoln's own personal quotes he had no plans to interfere with slavery in the South.  The US had high tariffs on industrial goods and virtually non-existent tariffs on raw materials. Thus Southern States either had to buy Northern goods for high prices or European goods with high tariffs. This had been a huge political controversy decades before the civil war, and sparked other minor secession events, such as the nullification crisis. And of course, as it was a tax imposed on the South, the money raised was disproportionately spent in the North.  It is also why Great Britain, which had already abolished slavery, was contemplating joining the war on the side of the Confederacy."
cringe,3bh7tx,Dr_Hilarius,14,Mon Jun 29 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"(Oh boy. Hot damn ho here we go again)    Because those slave states were smart enough to realize that Lincoln had no intention of interfering with slavery in where it existed. Simply put the Southern states who seceded incorrectly believed that their so called peculiar institution was at risk if they remained part of the Union. I could  send you a myriad of quotes from the declaration of secession from several major confederate states as well as quotes from the Confederate Constitution itself.    Tariffs had been a huge political controversy prior to the Civil War but it simply wasn't the chief reason why the South seceded. It may have been why Great Britain considered joining the war against the Union (that among plenty of other reason) but it was NOT why the South seceded.   I wasn't gonna waste my time with this but I'm a history major who specializes in American History and these debates usually reflect a nasty combination of a desire to re-write history and romanticize the Confederacy. Here is the proof that each state considered slavery as the chief reason for secession:    http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/    Plz crtl +f  ""tariff"" Plz crtl+f ""slavery""    K. Now if you want even MORE proof I'd be more than happy to PM you even more information. I have a stack of historical evidence I send people when these debates crop up. This comment section wouldn't do it justice as their are dozens of primary source documents from the leaders of the confederacy (at both the state and con-""federal"" level) adamantly stating they are fighting to preserve the institution of slavery."
cringe,3bh7tx,Dr_Hilarius,-13,Mon Jun 29 07:31:44 2015 UTC,"Plz crtl +f ""tariff"" Plz crtl+f ""slavery   That's disingenuous as Georgia never refers to the economic sanctions imposed on them as tariffs, yet they are describing exactly that.  Do you have all the declarations or just the ones that specifically reference slavery? The constitution of the Confederacy would also be interesting, although I suppose I could find that myself.  I would like to ask for more quotes, but I feel that it would be a collection of quote mining, and not a fairly balanced representation of attitudes of the time."
cringe,3bh7tx,matresslilac,11,Mon Jun 29 07:52:07 2015 UTC,"I think I've more than met the burden of proof in demonstrating that the South was overwhelmingly concerned with preserving slavery as both an economic and social system. At the very least the states that seceded first and the founding elements of the Confederacy considered the issue of slavery to be the prime issue for political action.     I mean for god sakes dude the Georgia Declaration for secession even say as plain as day that while the Republican Party has stances on issues that the South is hostile to (tariffs), slavery is the critical reason as to why the can no longer be a art of the Union.    ""The party of Lincoln, called the Republican party, under its present name and organization, is of recent origin. It is admitted to be an anti-slavery party. While it attracts to itself by its creed the scattered advocates of exploded political heresies, of condemned theories in political economy, the advocates of commercial restrictions, of protection, of special privileges, of waste and corruption in the administration of Government, anti-slavery is its mission and its purpose. By anti-slavery it is made a power in the state. The question of slavery was the great difficulty in the way of the formation of the Constitution.""  LOL. You don't get much clearer than that. I really don't understand the romanticize or re visioning of the Southern cause for secession. I agree 100% that Lincoln and the political leadership of the North in general had no desire to abolish slavery but the South was so irrationally afraid and defensive of the institution they were willing to secede anyways.    Now if you understand the historical context of the decision it may not seem so irrational. Even if Lincoln himself never abolished slavery he promised to ban slavery in new territories that would eventually become states in the Union. This meant that if the South stayed in the Union all they had to do was wait until the North elected an actual radical abolitionist with a slight majority in the Senate (the North would always win the House by virtue of population) then slavery would be ended.    You have to remember that Lincoln wasn't even on the BALLOT in the Southern states yet he still won (albeit as a minority president). If the South stayed in the Union slavery would inevitably die within the next two decades or even less. They could live with tariffs, they could NOT live with the social and economic upheaval that abolition would cause.    I'm not sure what else could convince you that slavery was the primary cause."

I'm not sure what else could convince you that slavery was the primary cause.   Perhaps I am thinking about things too rationally and not taking into consideration the propaganda and paranoid attitudes of the time. But they were under no direct threat from abolition at the current point in time, and slaver states fought for the Union. It makes much more sense for it to be a war fought over protectionist policies than one fought over slavery or all the slaver states should have been united behind the common cause.  Also slavery was only beneficial to a small percentage of extremely wealthy plantation owners. It also makes no sense for the average citizen to be willing to secede over an issue only affecting such an elite minority.  Furthermore, although the declarations you have linked do indeed make slavery their primary grievance, that is not all of them and they are apparently the only declarations that reference slavery at all. So it isn't a complete sample. In Jefferson Davis's address to the Confederate Congress he mentions the tariffs and economic policies first and then mentions slavery."
cringe,3bh7tx,matresslilac,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:30:04 2015 UTC,"The southern states absolutely believed they were under threat of abolition. You have to understand the context at the time, which followed not only the events of Bleeding Kansas but also the federal government's refusal to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act.   But you also seem to be trivializing the Declarations of Causes by the seceding states. You pointed out earlier that you could only find 5, and that is because those were the only states that wrote a Declarations of Cause. The other seceding states wrote shorter secession statements but that is why the page only listed 5.  http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/secession/  There is also the quite clear Cornerstone address by Alexander Hamilton. There have been revisionist attempts, even by Hamilton himself, to downplay his words and the importance of slavery. However,you only have to look at the big picture to see that leaders in the south correctly foresaw an end to their peculiar institution. And while it's true most southerners didn't own slaves, around 1/3 of households did, which really underpins just how vital it was to their way of life.  http://www.civilwarcauses.org/stat.htm  Finally, something a lot of people don't seem to know is that the Confederate constitution is somewhat of a direct copy of the American constitution; indeed many of the articles were entirely plagiarized. That is apart from the legal enshrinement of slavery, you will find little other significant changes made to their constitution. Certainly no mythical shift of power from federalism.    http://www.jjmccullough.com/CSA.htm  What it comes down to is you can see the confederacy however you want to, and many people would certainly prefer that the war was more justly fought over states rights or whatever. From a historical standpoint however, you'll find that the vast majority of research points to this being post-war lost cause revisionism. No amount of deflection on the point of the North's many sins will distract from the South's own legacy as captured in its own words.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/19/how-people-convince-themselves-that-the-confederate-flag-represents-freedom-not-slavery/  http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/"
cringe,3bh7tx,TwentyEnvelope,5,Mon Jun 29 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"Lincoln's own personal views on slavery are very complex and subject to change throughout his life after many meetings with abolitionists. Nevertheless you are correct in that his primary goal was to preserve the union, and that quote you seem to be fond of speaks to that desire. Later on you can find quotes by him staunchly against slavery, but as I said earlier it is a complicated topic on which already exists a large body of research.  However, and I'm tired of bringing this up to everyone who claims that slavery wasn't central to the start of the civil war, we have primary sources from the confederacy that indicate the reasons for secession and the confederacy itself really did center around slavery.   You can read each Confederate state's declaration of secession, which you'll notice most mention slavery right away: http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html?  and you can also read the ""cornerstone speech"" by Confederate VP Alexander Hamilton, which states multiple times that slavery and white supremacy is the titular ""cornerstone"" of the Confederacy itself: http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/alexander-h-cornerstone.html   From the amount of research that exists today, you'll find broad agreement among historians that slavery really was the central cause of the civil war. It is very difficult to find another reading that is not explicitly dishonest or reaching and irrelevant (e.g, ""Lincoln was a racist, too!"")  edit: Here is an excellent AskHistorians thread that contains the relevant quotes of the documents I linked, and also provides a good rebuttal to the premise that the Emancipation Proclamation purposely didn't affect Northern slaves (ignoring the fact that most Northern states had already abolished slavery by this time...) https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3aph04/is_this_askreddit_comment_about_the_us_civil_war/cseqf33"

The benefits and risks of staying with the union outweighed the benefits and risks of joining the confederacy. Correct me if I'm wrong but weren't the main confederate states the ones where there were strong cotton industries that required the free labor of slaves to be as profitable as they were at the time? The more northern slave holding union states were less likely to have as strong cotton industries and probably had more close economic ties to the industrial north with it's trading ports.  If by chance-which did actually happen- the issue went from slavery in the new states  to slavery in all states, the union slave states would not suffer as much as confederate slave states from the abolition of slavery because slave labor did not prop up their economy as much."

(spirit country like spirit animal)  We got to this kid who I never really spoke to before and with this goofy smile he goes, ""my spirit country is the Confederacy"".

If they majority of the people wanted to take down the American flag it would be taken down. The confederate flag can be flown personally.

That is not the correct reasoning for the removal of the Confederate flag. The US does not operate under the idea that if the majority wants something than they get it, because that it what leads to ""Tyranny of the majority""."
cringe,3bh7tx,FartasticBlast,0,Mon Jun 29 20:30:19 2015 UTC,Removing the confederate flag does not infringe upon any individual's or group's natural or otherwise lawful rights. There is no tyranny here.  Having  the people vote on or their elected officials deliberate and come to the conclusion on whether or not they wish to take down the flag is not tyranny. If every decision that was made without one-hundred percent approval was called tyranny nothing would get done. The election of the president would be tyranny since there is a very clear group of people who opposed his election. Also no where in the constitution is there are special provision that says that no flags must be taken down if a segment no matter how small opposes the action.  Ironically is a violation of states' right if the states could not lawfully choose to take down the flag.
cringe,3bh7tx,tysontt,2,Mon Jun 29 08:16:50 2015 UTC,"My point isn't that removing the Confederate flag was infringing on anybodies rights, just that it wasn't simply because a majority of the population wanted it. Besides, the US is not a direct democracy in which the population votes on every decision, so it is not up to the majority to decide in most cases.  Also, just in case you don't realize, I support the flags removal. I just don't think it was removed just because the majority wanted it removed."

However if you read the book or watch the movie, ""Game Change"" you'll realize why they chose her. She is very charismatic and she knew how to say things which would make great sound bites, get good applause. There are clips of her on YouTube before she became a ""celebrity"" where she talks about her son going to Afghanistan, talks about her views on being pro-life (she has a daughter who has down syndrome). These types of things appeal to a lot of people, it makes her relatable. And if you're a conservative woman, it just makes it even better. There are many other politicians who have made it into higher office who are just as ignorant if not more than her. Like Michelle Bachmann, Bobby Jindal, Ted Cruz, etc..

I could go on for pages about the ins and outs, but what it comes down to is the following hypothetical exchange:  ""Previously, your party spoke out against the intrusive and overbearing nature of federalist practices, and championed Confederalism. Now that your party has managed to take over influence in Washington DC, many of your policies and push for privatization have been pushed through sweeping Federal legislation and executive orders.

Perhaps those same idiots WOULD still have voted for her if she did the honorable thing but admitted she was completely ignorant. But there's a greater chance of her holding onto those idiot voters if she at least ATTEMPTS to hide her stupidly from them rather than blatantly admitting it.

cringe,3bcfvx,craftylark,3,Sun Jun 28 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"A reactionary is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante   Well...the ""status quo ante SJWs"" whom are to blame for literally every injustice ever on reddit.   I see though. Thanks.   But I'm pretty sure I did mean ""reactionary"". Everyone gets their scrotes in a twist over everything and thinks that SJWs and ethnic minorities and religious people or even people that don't like the same television shows as them are always to blame and shit. Nobody likes it when le nice circlejerk is interrupted for other opinions."

I realize it has to do with sexual orientation, but they are celebrating that they just got marriage equality. Marriage is about family. I would not bring my kid to a pride festival where there are dildo's, butt plugs, and sexual innuendos on signs. I thought the pride festivals were supposed to be about love, not sex."
cringe,3bcfvx,lukewarm947,3,Sun Jun 28 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"I think it in part has to do with the subversion of heterosexual norms and a takedown of a really expansive prudish facade that exists in our culture. There's definitely a humorous or ""shock"" aspect to it."

So when the time came where she lent in for a kiss I responded thusly   ""Well, Dont worry I wouldnt try to sleep with you, night!""  let me reiterate, EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. Fuck...  I knew the moment it came out of my mouth it was the stupidest thing because it was totally okay for me to want to sleep with her but the damage was done and even if it wasnt the final nail in the coffin was struck when I lurched out the chair and fled through the front door. 5 Years later and I wake up in cold sweats thinking about that."

cringe,3bcjt6,ExploreMeDora,7,Sun Jun 28 02:02:02 2015 UTC,This comment is cringe! Thank you for contributing.
cringe,3bcjt6,isen7,10,Sun Jun 28 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"Cringe-worthy content should be of some sort of awkward or embarrassing social situation, involving two or more individuals (either directly or indirectly).   Lol, you cut off right before the important part. Being on TV is a social situation, hence ""indirectly"". What rule #1 is trying to prevent is videos of people talking to a camera, or ""vlogs""."
cringe,3bcjt6,the_tiny_steve,-19,Sun Jun 28 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"In one scenario someone talks into a camera, records it, and then uploads it to Youtube for people to watch. In the other someone dances in front of a camera, records it, and then plays it on television for people to watch. I fail to see the fundamental difference.    If you seriously thing that this is cringey you need to get your head examined."
cringe,3bcjt6,isen7,5,Sun Jun 28 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"How do you not see the difference between someone making a video in their room for a youtube channel and someone being recorded for live TV (the news)?  I'm not saying that there's no audience for the person making the youtube video, but that would be considered a personal video, whereas a news broadcast is a public video."
cringe,3bcjt6,botsects,-2,Sun Jun 28 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"You keep moving the goal-post around.   How do you not see the difference between someone making a video in their room for a youtube channel and someone being recorded for live TV (the news)?  I'm not saying that there's no audience for the person making the youtube video, but [the youtube video] would be considered a personal video, whereas a news broadcast is a public video.   Calling a youtube clip a ""personal"" video is a weasel word.  Folks can set their video to private or public -- just like your ""news broadcast.""  edit: also on the /r/cringe sidebar is the subreddit summary:   /r/cringe is the place for videos or personal stories involving an awkward or embarrassing situation for two or more people involved."
cringe,3bcjt6,isen7,2,Sun Jun 28 08:35:40 2015 UTC,"You're taking an emphasis on the words that I'm saying rather than the meaning of what I'm saying. Both of the things I said are the exact same things just said differently.  A personal video doesn't mean that they don't share it with other people, it just means that at the time of making the video, the contents of the video solely belong to the person making it. There is no implication that anyone will see it. There is a chance that the video will go viral, but no guarantee.  A public video, one such as a news broadcast, has implications that it will be viewed by hundreds of thousands of people at the time of filming. There are plenty of people on set witnessing it, and the video is going straight out into hundreds of thousands of peoples TVs.  Imagine someone talking on stage. Being on a popular news station is the exact same thing as talking on stage, except instead of the audience being in the room, they're at home. But there is still a guaranteed audience."

Both of the things I said are the exact same things just said differently.   No offense, but your argument's ridiculous.  Even using your bastardized differentiation between public, ""personal"" and private, personal accounts (which includes vlogs) are still allowed in the subreddit -- which is pretty significant.  I quoted the reddit overview upthread.  Either you overlooked it or willfully chose to ignore it."

cringe,3bcjt6,botsects,0,Sun Jun 28 22:47:33 2015 UTC,I genuinely appreciate your tone.  I'm clarifying that /r/cringe doesn't exclude personal videos (it's in the sub-reddit overview).  Folks are mis-interpreting the sub's criteria.

Not only is it completely bizarre to pull a dragon fly into his mouth and chew it for no reason. 2. the bigger issue here is the fact that this guy intentionally went out of his way to do something that would make a little girl cry. Regardless of the fact that it was a pet dragonfly, to a little girl a pet is a pet. You don't walk up to someone and eat their dog or their cat.   Sorry, random acts of assholeness piss me off."

We stood guard just like these guys did but were not actually military. However we stood hour long stands wherein we couldn't talk or move around except the ""beat"" which he does in the video (15 paces back from post, 15 paces back to post). We would generally do 3 1-hour stands in a day.  We had tourists come up all the time and do shit like this.   We wore kilts since we were a highland regiment, and I wish I could tell you that it was mostly cheeky younger women who were the likeliest people to try and slide a hand up your kilt but I would be lying. It was always seemingly sweet older ladies who would stand to take a picture with you and then all of a sudden you would feel a hand on the back of your thigh moving up.  They thought it was hilarious, but if a male visitor tried that with one of our female interpreters they would have been arrested.  Also, the number of times I was jokingly asked if I was wearing anything under my kilt was exhausting. Every tourist thought they were the most clever person that ever walked through the gates.  At first it was hard not to laugh at the things people did while you were posted on guard duty but after a while the jokes were the same each day, all day, and you had to resist punching them rather than laughing."

So you'll do say a few tours of Afghansitan and then you get selected by your Commanding Officer to do a 6 month stint guarding the Queen, then you go back to your regiment and back on tour of duty. These guys don't do this for 30 years, it's an honour to do it and is a reward for good service.  Whitehall is guarded by the Household Cavalry who are responsible for driving tanks.

cringe,3bb3dr,Johnnynukemall,4,Sat Jun 27 16:08:13 2015 UTC,...the more you know.
cringe,3bb3dr,Tszemix,-19,Sat Jun 27 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"Because a blow to the head with a helmet on still kills you.   Only if you get hit by a mace or warhammer. A sabre would most likely just glance of depending on the shape of the helmet. If this was the case that you would die from a swordhit on your helmet, then why did so many cultures use helmets before gunpowder?"
cringe,3bb3dr,Johnnynukemall,11,Sat Jun 27 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"This is the gunpowder age. Mobility is key, they weren't going to put a heavy ass helmet on people who need to hear what's going on and who need to be able to rapidly move around."
cringe,3bb3dr,Tszemix,-10,Sat Jun 27 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"Helmets don't need to be heavy in order to be effective against slashing weapons such as sabers. Contrary to popular belief, medieval style armor were not clumsy as depicted in movies. Check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1YEkuWYUKM and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q&feature=youtu.be.  Also with the impaired hearing thing, you know about skullcaps or the type of helmets used in WW1 and WW2?"
cringe,3bb3dr,Tmlkrslll,3,Sat Jun 27 16:57:02 2015 UTC,There's a reason they stopped wearing full sets of armor. I still wouldn't take a sabre or lance hit to the head wearing modern helmets anyways.
cringe,3bb3dr,Johnnynukemall,-8,Sat Jun 27 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"There's a reason they stopped wearing full sets of armor.   That is because armor is expensive and offers almost no protection against bullets. It was faster and more cost effective to train and equip citizens with muskets rather than for example bows/crossbows.   I still wouldn't take a sabre or lance hit to the head wearing modern helmets anyways.   Your own physiology does not represent that of a pre gunpowder soldier. You are refering to modern helmets right, but there were helmets made to offer protection against cutting weapons."

Battles were still decided by the bayonet, wearing heavy armor meant you got hit with more volleys while running the risk of disrupting your lines and even a rout."
cringe,3bb3dr,Tszemix,-3,Sat Jun 27 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"And I wasn't talking about how they can fight but rather how fast they can move on a battlefield to gain the advantage on the battlefield.   Believing that a skullcap helmet alone would limit your maeuverability is just incomprehensible.    Battles were still decided by the bayonet, wearing heavy armor meant you got hit with more volleys while running the risk of disrupting your lines and even a rout.   Didn't you watch the videos that I posted as a reference? Besides the main advantage of bayonets were to protect yourself against cavalry charges. The bayonet is a more cost effective method to deal with cavalry than a pike."

cringe,3bb3dr,Ezekiiel,6,Sat Jun 27 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"They usually rotate between the five regiments, this guy is Welsh Guards, the clue is the grouping of buttons on the tunic.   They also have different coloured plumes and collar badges, but the video is too low resolution to tell."

These guys wear these horrendous anachronistic uniforms with the long red coat and the bear-skin, so it's perhaps not surprising that people try and fuck with them all day. If they wore a modern military uniform, ignorant tourists would better understand what these guys are: soldiers on duty and not actors in silly costumes."

cringe,3bb3dr,Ryanc621,4,Sun Jun 28 12:27:34 2015 UTC,They've switched to modern kit when the threat level is high enough. When the 7/7 bombings happened they were seen to be wearing combats with body armour and kevlar helmets.   There was rumour in the tabloids that they're being issued with covert armour to wear under the tunic and being issued full mags in case of another Lee Rigby style attack.

cringe,3bb3dr,philtyphil32,3,Sun Jun 28 08:49:09 2015 UTC,"Guards aren't allowed to make arrests (I don't think). In fact one was disciplined for kicking a tourist in the shins as he marched, he was being heckled, kicked the tourist as he marched, and the guy complained to the police."

Anyway, Kanye has not made a habit of stage invasions and to be fair my use of the phrase ""get shitty"" WAS inaccurate. I promise I will never, ever say a bad word about Mr West again, because the psyches of his fans are apparently too delicate to take such nastiness. And I certainly won't point out that he married a vacuous, plastic golem that has no discernible talent or brain function and who is only famous for having a father that helps murderers get off and for making a shoddy porn film which involves her getting somebody off."

cringe,3b9jbx,aweinz,222,Sat Jun 27 03:37:25 2015 UTC,This is not how you handle shoplifting. They guy was actually worse than the girl.
cringe,3b9jbx,FakeAudio,107,Sat Jun 27 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why there are policies in place at stores that address shoplifting situations. I worked at a luxury retail store awhile back, and putting items into a container was not considered shoplifting. Shoplifting is when you leave the store with the items.  You can obviously confront customers and be like ""Oh, did you need me to hold that for you? (Or get a shopping cart in this case)"" but you never should directly assume the customer is a thief, regardless of their true intent."
cringe,3b9jbx,Midwinter_Jicker,16,Sat Jun 27 07:32:42 2015 UTC,"At the store I used to work at, there were/are a thousand ladies who will come in each and every day and carry their stuff around in bags they brought from home. It's a big store, but the employees can still see her leave and there are presumably video cameras. I will never for the life of me understand why the guy in the video thinks that he is more perceptive than the employees of the store. Granted, most of the guys out in the store may be min wage teenagers, but he might as well just tell them to tell the manager that he may want to keep an eye on this customer, because you saw something, and you're not accusing her of stealing, but it could look like stealing, bla bla bla."
cringe,3b9jbx,hamfraigaar,10,Sat Jun 27 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on local laws. Placing items into a container and placing a cover over said container can be considered ""willful concealment""."
cringe,3b9jbx,SqueezyCheez85,2,Sat Jun 27 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, once you take with intent to steal, you've committed a crime. The guy above you is just saying their store chose not to enforce/confront people until they had left the building."
cringe,3b9jbx,orm518,4,Sat Jun 27 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that seems a little more obvious if you're placing a cover over the container, but would that apply to something like a purse since there is no cover?"
cringe,3b9jbx,Midwinter_Jicker,3,Sat Jun 27 16:40:42 2015 UTC,I think that would be an even easier case to make. Everything inside a purse is considered in possession by the wearer. Placing an unpaid item into a purse would be a form of dispossession... which is theft.
cringe,3b9jbx,SqueezyCheez85,4,Sat Jun 27 17:28:29 2015 UTC,Holy shit I've never made the connection but a couple times when I was younger I've had employees come up and offer to hold things at the front for me. I always thought it was them being nice but you totally changed that.  Also I'm a white guy who's never shoplifted once in my life. I can't imagine if I was black.
cringe,3b9jbx,v3xx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:13:05 2015 UTC,It's awesome. They assume I'm stealing things because I'm black so I basically get a human cart to carry my stuff around for me.
cringe,3b9jbx,BlastCapSoldier,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:35 2015 UTC,not to mention there are people actually watching out for things like this at the big retail stores.  I know for a fact that there is always a secret service type of job you can get at walmart where you look out for shop lifting.  To avoid problems like false accusations that could of happened in the video the worker who see's this cannot approach the suspect until they actually walking out of the store doors.  Once they walk out then the employee can now choose any action they want to get the stolen goods back.
cringe,3b9jbx,wareagle3000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:07 2015 UTC,It's walmart.  You can safely assume that
cringe,3b9jbx,im_a_grill_btw_AMA,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard that if you accuse someone of shoplifting before they exit the store, the crime will be dismissed. Like if a cop searches you without reason or whatever it is, anything they find is thrown out."
cringe,3b9jbx,NormThaPenguine,13,Sat Jun 27 07:57:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't try to take things out of the store, is there a crime? There's no law against using a bag to shop."

cringe,3b9jbx,BetterCallBob,4,Sat Jun 27 13:50:40 2015 UTC,In some states concealing items before buying them can be considered shoplifting so yes.
cringe,3b9jbx,aweinz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:12:08 2015 UTC,I doubt that's true. Of course everything is different from state to state but in many states it is illegal just to conceal items before paying for them.
cringe,3b9jbx,aweinz,2,Sat Jun 27 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"He definitely handled it in a very weird and immature way. Honestly I just find it so strange how irritated he got with her, she didn't even give him and attitude or anything, he called her out, then she starts putting the stuff back on the shelves and makes it obvious she has no other stolen goods in her purse. He then asks her for ID,  and it's like what the fuck? You're not a cop or even loss prevention, you're an average citizen asking for my ID? Who the fuck are you? Then he gets even weirder and starts following her around the store and as they get closer to the entrance where most of the employees are he tries getting louder and more obnoxious to cause a scene and starts asking for management.... And they wouldn't even do anything since she has nothing left on her....  Overall just an extremely odd and rent-a-coppish way to handle such a petty act"

cringe,3b9jbx,onemadnigga,13,Sun Jun 28 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"That's a really ignorant statement. I'm not here to bash you, but here to inform you. Shrinkage is the main concern with a lot of individual stores. Corporations break down how much shrinkage an individual store takes and often times bases how much labor/money the store can spend on employees, fixtures, etc. Sure you can say that ""oh I'm just stealing from a billion dollar corporation"" when in fact its much more than that."

cringe,3b9jbx,Kadaj2302,3,Tue Jun 30 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"Walmart lowers the quarterly bonus for all of the employees based on a few things, shoplifting being a main one.  Multi bullion dollar Walmart probably doesn't hurt much from shoplifting but the guy making $9 an hour with a potential bonus of $550 every quarter definitely cares.     Theft picks the pocket of the associates, not the bigwigs."
cringe,3b9jbx,blipOn16radars,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"Not only for the other reasons listed, but also because if she's going to steal from Walmart, why exclude small companies as well?

But he wanted to be a hero, so he took out his phone and made a huge scene out of it. He didn't even know that the lady was shoplifting, which she may have been, but she also just could have been carrying the items in her purse to take them to the cash register. The point is that he was out of line confronting her in the first place.   It's kind of like trying to kick someone else out of a club that you're at, rather than getting a bouncer to do it. It's not your job, and you aren't allowed to pass judgement like that."

cringe,3b9jbx,braunheiser,10,Sat Jun 27 03:00:05 2015 UTC,"I remember learning this in a Business Law class. It becomes an issue for the judge / jury to decide and lawyers to argue. We heard about this case where a college basketball player was walking around a liquor store with full bottles of booze inside his pants when he was caught. he argued that he didn't have anywhere else to store them while he shopped, but he lost because it was decided that the location of the items was a completely unreasonable place of storage and suggested intent to shoplift.  There is however a huge issue with the whole ""point of purchase"" and that the person needs to walk well past it to be proven shoplifting. For example I worked at a grocery store where there was also a whole food court with buffets of prepared foods like chinese, pizza, salad bar etc. Legally, a person can walk right up to the food court and begin eating food until someone tells them they have to leave. Legally they haven't stolen anything because there isn't really a distinct law that says one cannot eat something that was laid out. The person does not destroy any packaging when they eat the item and there is no value on a food item that cannot be weighed since it's already in the person's stomach. The store just has to ban them and call police if they ever go on the property again to be arrested for loitering."

The issue is that for the 100% abstinence stat. They just use the common thinking, that if you don't have sex, you wont get pregnant, which is correct.     However for things like the condom being 98% effective the stat goes like this. ""If 100 average couples have sex using the condom for a year, two will get pregnant"".

cringe,3b85u8,Emojoan,9,Sat Jul 4 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"The difference is between 'perfect use' of a birth control and 'typical use'. For example, consider people who in high school pledge to abstain until marriage. How many of them will have sex? Surveys say that it has very little impact on their sexual behaviour, however they would be 'practicing abstinence'.     People who forget to take the pill and get pregnant are included in the statistics on the failure rate of the pill. People who pledge abstinence and then have sex anyway should be included too. You might say, well they weren't practising abstinence at the time. Well the person on the pill wasn't on it at the time either. The point is that 'ease of use and availability' are included in the stats for 'typical use'. Abstinence is pretty hard to use perfectly it seems."

Also, you can know about buckling up just in case you do ever decide to get in one.  Just cause you choose not to ever get into a car doesn't automatically make you a moron.

I was using the car example as an analogy :) and of course if you live in some village of 20 people where nobody owns a car the analogy would break down. But if you live in New York then the analogy would still apply.  The thing is that abstinence usually goes hand in hand with sex education bans because knowing how your naughty parts work might incite young'uns to do the nasty.   Giving kids access to birth control as well as education is double security so that if they choose to experiment at least they won't be ending up in Palin's situation for a second and very probably third time :)"

cringe,3ba5gl,aznsensation8,2,Sun Jun 28 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"Aikido demonstrations look odd to an outsider because it's not instantly apparent what's going on. The reason students go flying in these demonstrations is because they've been trained to fall without injuring themselves. If these throwing techniques are applied in real life, it doesn't look graceful at all because the attacker doesn't know how to fall and maintain momentum and stability. So while it may look super-fake in demonstrations, that's actually because both the instructor and students are applying the techniques of Aikido properly."

cringe,3b6j04,Lepryy,6,Fri Jun 26 16:00:21 2015 UTC,Yeah that'll work if there's isn't a long strip before you get to the going down part

cringe,3b6j04,dualitylol,3,Sat Jun 27 02:09:17 2015 UTC,"I learned it with 2nd foot strapped on, way easier. Its especially hard with one foot only if you dont have any grip sticker in the middle of your board. The steep hill climb right in the beginning didnt help either"
cringe,3b6j04,ghuldorgrey,2,Sat Jun 27 11:42:44 2015 UTC,Meh. You just need to learn to board with one foot out. Makes catwalks or short downhills to trail entrances off the lift way easier
cringe,3b6j04,-SnowmanMafia-,10,Fri Jun 26 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"Safety reasons. Not only can you not move on flat ground with both feet buckled in, but not a single lift operator (Chairlift or t-bar) will let you go up with both feet in. Obviously that only applies to snowboarders."
cringe,3b6j04,jarawd,7,Fri Jun 26 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"The reason in a t-bar lift you can't lock both feet in because you could really hurt yourself if you fall. Because you should put the T-bar between you legs. If you fall, with a loose foot the T-bar can release quite easily and fly away (yes the really shoot up really fast). Or you can move your leg to let te T-bar get away. This is very hard to do with both feet strapped in.  In chairlift it is mainly due to the way you sit. It's a bit difficult to explain but I'll give it a try. If you strap both feet in, your board is parallel to shoulders. Skiers have their skies perpendicular to their shoulders.  Skiers can rest their skies on a little feet rest, connected to a safety bar, which a chairlift usually has. So sitting shoulder to shoulder, their skies don't hit each other.  As A snowboarder you strap in one foot you can twist your board and rest it on a feet rest, like skiers do.If you have both feed strapped in you can't really sit, because you'll take up to much space. When sitting shoulder to shoulder, your board hits everything. and you can't rotate your body, because if you do you can slip out the lift. An other thing is that the safety can't be closed, because your board is in the way. You could move your board out of the way, but sitting that way is very uncomfortable. The last main reason is that, if you fall when disembarking a ski-lift and fall on the exit ramp. It is far easier to get up with out feet loose en step out of the way.  Source: I've skied for 2 years and snowboarded for about 8."
cringe,3b6j04,Mezzezo,4,Fri Jun 26 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Can I ask a really stupid question?  I've never skied before but would love to.  Problem is, I'm terrified of heights and would sooner chew off my own leg then get on one of those chairs that hang from a wire.  The T-bar looks like something I can manage with no anxiety.    Are those T-bars common at ski places?"
cringe,3b6j04,FuturePigeon,9,Fri Jun 26 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"No problem. I don't how bad your fear of heights is and I don't know where you live. It completely depends on the ski area. T-bars are always in a ski area.   T-bars are mostly used for the bunny hill. That's where you learn to ski. So hen you're learning to ski you mostly use the T-bar type lifts. But after that, when the bunny becomes boring, you might want to try somewhere higher, and that will mean going in a chairlift or a gondola lift.   Sometimes T-bars are used for more lower or shorter pistes. Like here in Winterberg in Germany. This is quite a small area, though, but very nice for beginners. Even the chairlifts there don't get very high. Some stick low to the ground. (like 4/5 (12/15 feet) meters off the ground).  Other option is to try a ski-hall. It's an enclosed ski piste. Usually with T-bars, or other dragging type lifts(or those annoying conveyor belt things) . Sometimes a chairlift.  But yes, skiing and snowboarding comes with dealing with heights. Lifts, but as well standing on top of a piste and looking down. It isn't easy, but well worth it. My aunt had a fear of heights as well, not a crippling fear. But she hates the chairlift as well. But she loves skiing more, so she goes in them anyway. It's a necessary evil.   Ohh. If you've never skied of snowboard before. Get a lesson, at least to learn the basics. You'll enjoy skiing much more, when you know what you are doing, and you feel in control of what you are doing.   I hope this helped. I hope you still want to try it. And now I want to go snowboarding.   Edit: the colour of the lines (the pistes) in the link tells you the difficulty of a piste. Blue: easy, Red: medium (steeper), Black: hard(steepest). (the black straight lines are lifts)"

cringe,3b6j04,Mezzezo,2,Fri Jun 26 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"Mammoth is pretty big, and also expensive. Your money would be better spent at a smaller, cheaper resort that has more beginner terrain. I think June Mountain would be a good choice, and it's pretty close to Mammoth."
cringe,3b6j04,GOJI_RA,3,Fri Jun 26 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like heights either. The chair lifts aren't as trigger inducing as you would think. The bar in front, the layers of clothing, the snow below and the people beside you make a big difference. Plus, you might be too tired to have the fear instinct kick in.  Chair lifts are for longer lifts. You'd be too tired if you T-barred for a long, long, long lift. (You can rest your legs on a chair lift. T-bars would be for shorter runs, where it's not economical or feasible to have a full blown chair."
cringe,3b6j04,dee_lio,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"When I go snowboarding with my friends we always take separate lifts so we can each strap in on the ride up and not worry about having no space. Really not that hard as long as your arms are long enough to bend over the safety bar. I just much prefer strapping in on the lift because it makes doing a run much quicker. I mean, you're already on the lift, might as well make use of the time and get ready instead of twiddling your thumbs and then wasting time at the top of the mountain strapping in.  Just my opinion on it."
cringe,3b6j04,Lepryy,2,Sat Jun 27 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"not a very experienced boarder and have never used the t bar lift, but I think it's because he needs to push up to the lift and then once you get off there is usually a flat zone you need to push on again."

cringe,3b6j04,SofaKingWeeToddDid,7,Fri Jun 26 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, they can slow it down. But slowing down, and speeding up a lift can be very jerky. Then it is even for a experienced skier or snowboarder quite tricky to stay upright. For snowboarders it is even quite painful."
cringe,3b6j04,Mezzezo,4,Fri Jun 26 17:40:25 2015 UTC,I never seen a T-Bar on anything other then a bunny hill. Are these actually common on other mountains.

cringe,3b6j04,MayonnaisePacket,2,Sat Jun 27 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely freeze more at those T-bar things. You're not really doing much moving, you're basically just holding on. If it's REALLY cold and you make the mistake of gripping the metal instead of the plastic, you may even freeze your hands.  In the chair, you are of course not doing much moving either, but at least you're isolated from behind, you are comfy and some lifts have hoods you can put up in front, so you're safe from the weather. It also gives you the chance to eat your sandwich you prepared beforehand, or drink some delicious hot chocolate with rum, which REALLY warms you up!"

It's a small area, they mostly have chairlift, but quite a few T-bars as well. These aren't really steep pistes or long pistes, so many have the T-bar. Some are very steep lifts, which really hurts for a snowboarder.    In the Alps there are less T-bar lifts, mostly on the bunny hills. But sometimes, there are still T-bars. Like here in Hoch Ziillertall still has a few T-bars for their more remote pistes."

cringe,3b6j04,AppleJuiceCookies,4,Sat Jun 27 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, it can be hard in the fact that it burns your inner thy and you have to balance it right, but this guy isn't even getting that far. As soon as the T-bar is in between his legs he just goes limp and puts all his weight on it. If the operator or his friends would just explain this a little bit to him (since he's too dumb to figure it out), then there could at least be some valid attemps."

The t-bar isn't even the worst offender.  Behold, the poma lift!  A lift mechanism so weird it needs a training video.  I'll never forget my last t-bar encounter.  I finally got on, and started moving up the hill, only to fall half way, then forced to slalom down avoiding all the other lifts until i could get back to the start.  Ugh."

cringe,3b6j04,smakusdod,4,Fri Jun 26 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"you gotta quickly put that thing between your legs, position it behind your ass, and then lean in such a way that you don't sit on it, yet you don't let it run you over. You are constantly adjusting your balance as you glide over the snow, and its varying degrees of friction.  It's difficult for a skier, and for a snowboarder its basically impossible.  But its damn hilarious."
cringe,3b6j04,icy_llama,7,Fri Jun 26 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"These things were a nightmare at first but not so bad after a bit of practice. As a snowboarder the worst part is the jolt at the start a lot of them do. Most of the time I'd grab/position it fine and then just brace myself for the inevitable little hop I'm about to do when it kicks in and I fuck up.  The problem is, these are the kinda lifts that are positioned for the easier slopes...and the less-experienced. This means you get a horrible combo of people just learning how to balance on their skis/board for the first time AND a lift that's pretty testing.  Oh, and if you're off-balance for a second (due to jolts in the movement or varying friction like you said) you should just prepare to eat snow..  I've boarded in Italy, Vermont US and Austria and never seen one of these T-bar lifts..I kinda want to try one now to see how I do, but then again maybe not! Are they really as bad as people say?!"
cringe,3b6j04,dee_lio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of getting used to, and you have to be mindful while using them. I think the natural instinct is to sit on it like a chair (you'll fall on your rear) or to use it like a water skier would (you'll use up all your energy, and there will be no slack in the line).   You have to place the bar right below your rear, grab the side of the ""T"" with your arm, and allow yourself to gently be pushed up the mountain. Once you get the balancing correct, your next natural instinct is to fight or overbalance or work against the unit. It's hard to allow the machine to do its thing.  Also, if you catch an edge, you can wipe out, take out your partner, and quite possibly someone behind you. Also, when you do wipe out in the middle of nowhere, you might have to tree trail it back to the bottom."

cringe,3b6j04,MeEvilBob,11,Sat Jun 27 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"I was a ski lift operator for 10 winters and will likely go back to it some day.  This kind of stuff happens so often that it gets annoying, especially when the lines are really long.  A patient lift operator is someone I would highly recommend tipping, there's so many that would just tell you to leave and go to another lift, enhancing your embarrassment in front of the whole crowd.  On any surface lift such as this one (a T-bar), it's like water skiing in that if at any point you feel uncomfortable, just let go.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to stop the entire lift because someone was holding on for dear life while dragging face down in the snow.  If it's not working out for you, then keep trying, even if that involves letting a few more experienced people go ahead of you.  One of my favorite techniques as a lift operator is when someone is really having a hard time, I'll take a shovel and tell them to hold on, then I'll slowly pull on it and tell them to try to take it from me.  If they can pull it enough to move their skis without falling, then they obviously have the upper-body strength to hold on.  This specific lift (a T-Bar) is designed for two skiers side by side with the bar between them just below the ass cheeks to pull them up the hill, both skiers need to remain standing as the bar would go right to the ground if you try to sit.  This does not work well for snowboarders, so instead they ride single while holding the bar in front of them.  The whole ""skiing sucks, snowboarding is cool"" culture of the late 1980s and early 90's is not only bullshit, but is also long forgotten in the ski industry.  If you're having a hard time on a snowboard, try skis, nobody cares what you use and if they do they're idiots.  I've been skiing my whole life and couldn't snowboard to save my life.  Do what feels right and get good at that rather than wasting time on the slopes trying to get better at something you think sucks just because your friends said it's better."
cringe,3b6j04,DietPillPyramid,7,Sat Jun 27 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"What a terrible lift operator. Beginner snowboarders always take a few shots to get the hang of riding a T.  This guy took no time to explain to the boarder how to ride it. His body language before getting on should have screamed ""I have no fucking idea what I'm doing""  A little instruction would have gone a long way, but instead, he shoves the T between the guy's legs.  The cringe here isn't the boarder, but the sub-par Liftie who takes no pride in his work.  When all else fails (some people are just shit) pair the beginner boarder with an experienced skiier, who can hold them up.  Source: Former Liftie, Snowboard instructor."

cringe,3b6j04,ghandis_gonads,7,Fri Jun 26 21:07:55 2015 UTC,I think chair lifts are pretty difficult for newbies because the drop off is usually a lot more extreme than on a tbar/other type of bunny hill lift.

I found that the best way to learn is to ride it 2 people at once. The reason for this is that the experienced t-bar rider can keep the bar from spinning and sliding off your butt.
cringe,3b6j04,UncleS1am,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"Best way to use these on a snowboard is to put it in the small of your back or under your butt while standing with both feet on the board and lean back into it.  Then you have to play it cool while riding up not trying to steer at all and letting your board wobble underneath you, it is disconcerting but typically rights itself due to the shape of the board and how eventually an edge will start dragging. Trying to steer will cause you to fall."
cringe,3b6j04,gd42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:55:31 2015 UTC,Wait how do you use this? The guys at the start make it look like you just grab it and hold on with your hand? Or do you sorta act like you're going to sit on it but let it pull you along?
cringe,3b6j04,thebuccaneersden,3,Fri Jun 26 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"You place it under your butt, and let it pull you forward. The usual problem is that if your ski/snowboard isn't waxed, it will jerk you at first, so you try to overcompensate by leaning backwards, trying to sit onto the T-bar. Then, you fall, because it isn't designed to support you horizontally. Another reason for falling is that you ski or snowboard steers away from the direction the lift is pulling you.  All my life I skied in places where most lifts were either T-bars or platter lifts, and they are extremely frustrating for beginners at first. 99% of new skiers fall 10-20 times first time they try it. But it's like bicycling, you only need to figure it out once, then it's a breeze."

I always thought my uncle was the coolest guy ever. He was so happy, so chipper, he was that guy who seemed like he was just so high energy all the time but said ohhh I never drink coffee natural energy! and was always trying to bring that way overly positive energy into a situation. As an adult, these people can be exhausting, but when I was a kid, I thought he was the man.  Anyways we get on the lift no problem. He's telling me about how he skies, and the places he's been, and he's telling me the basics of how to parallel ski, which I was going to learn that day.  We get to the top of the mountain and it was time to slide off of the ski lift. If you've never been skiing before, when you get to the exit point, you have to put your feet (skiis) down on the ground and push off of the seat a bit. You slide down this little incline and you're off the chair and ready to go.  I had no problem getting off, I had been to ski club at school and knew how to ski. My uncle seemed to have an issue though. I looked back and he was trying to get himself up off of the seat but he wasn't getting up fast enough. The window where he could put his feet down was closing fast. Too fast. Then it closed.  He scurried off of the lift but it was too late, he dropped down onto the incline and wiped straight out, instead of skiing down the little ramp he tumbled down it, skiis, in the air, then off of him, poles everywhere, he made a weird noise like a gurgling ummphhh when it was happening.   But then he got right up and just BERATED the lift operator. Claimed he had the lift going too fast, asked him if it was his first day, if he knew how to operate it at all, told him he sucks at his job. He turned into a total fucking asshole, one of the worst I've seen towards an employee somewhere. It was so awkward to be standing there as my little 10 year old self.  My uncle tried to come over and flip back in to his jovial personality but it wasn't working anymore. I had seen the darkness, the Mr. Hyde. I knew his true self and I was kinda scared of this dude now. The whole happy front he was putting up now just creeped me out, knowing that on the other side was this total dick human being. That was one of the first runs of the day and it was a long day where I couldn't wait to get home after that."

cringe,3b7m13,kyle_kyle_kyle_kyle,6,Mon Jun 29 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"Throughout the whole video she looks like she's in a lot of physical discomfort. If I had to guess I'd say she was in a state of psychosis likely the result of a deliriant. Given the range of recreational substances apt to cause this and considering her subsequent behavior, it isn't outlandish to assume she was also experiencing hallucinations. PCP comes to mind as a candidate for the substance in question, although a massive dose of what is typically a more pleasant psychedelic/hallucinogen is also probable.  Based off the available empirical data it appears that she was under the impression that a demon was crawling up her vagina. It probably ascended her interior using the spine much like a ladder, utilizing the spleen and other organs as steps for its hooves. Her contortions, a defensive response to the invasion, proved to be vain in stopping the beast. Once it reached her cranium it dug its claws deep into the cortex, taking control of her body and playing it much like a puppeteer to a marionette. The rolling of the eyes is a clear indicator of the passage of control from posessee to possessor -- the body becomes the demon's, while the mind helplessly watches and writhes.  It is well documented that certain objects hold significant power; the capability to touch and interact with realms beyond ours. The Egyptian Book of the Dead describes an object referred to as برينجلز, found always by the side of Osiris. It is a cylindrical object suspected of providing the god his sustenance when patrolling the underworld. Roughly translated to English this word is ""Pringles"". I don't want to insult anybody reading this, but I will state the obvious: the seeming coincidence between this arcane item and our beloved snackfood is in fact entirely deliberate and no coincidence at all. It is an act of obfuscation by its discoverer Liepa, who after discovering what the buffoon Baur had missed intended to hide the object in plain sight within the behemoth Procter & Gamble.  Most arcane objects are humble entities, not letting their power be known unless it is of the utmost necessity. Furthermore, most arcane objects are neutral in their intentions. Pringles are no different. Unfortunately the average mortal does not find themselves trekking through the underworld in need of a wieldy source of food. The existence of Pringles here, in our world, thusly becomes an insidious occurrence. We munch on the very crisps that can aide enemies of the living, unabated to the tremendous power and threat housed within cheddar, BBQ and jalapeño varieties.  In this case the great cylinder revealed its abilities, not to the victim screaming through those possessed and bygone eyes, but to the demonic cage surrounding her. It did the only thing one could expect it to do, and like a starving animal the monster lunged for sustenance from its home;--our damnation: the underworld, where it could capture the strength of Osiris."

If the attack is over, it's officially a counterattack, not a defense.   Let's say my wife stabs me in the leg in my sleep... I go to the hospital and get treatment. Then I come home and punch her in the face. That's not defense, that's retaliation. It's more clear when more time passes between incidents, but any time between the attack and the counterattack makes it no longer defense.   Now if this lady was approaching him again, than he would be entirely justified in the belief that a new attack was imminent and he could lay her out. But she was walking away.... So."

cringe,3b7m13,QUSHY,22,Fri Jun 26 19:08:01 2015 UTC,Maybe because they didn't see that because they weren't on the train? How the fuck would they know that happened?

cringe,3b7m13,aj240,7,Sat Jun 27 00:45:11 2015 UTC,More likely because they saw that the situation was escalating.
cringe,3b7m13,QUSHY,5,Sat Jun 27 03:05:03 2015 UTC,That doesn't justify them not doing jack shit when she was attacking them

cringe,3b7m13,Wobbling,14,Sat Jun 27 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"It was weird and creepy and not cool when she went at him, looked like her slowmo punch might have been unpleasant. After he secured the Pringles and went to over 9000 on her people started getting hurt.  Is it really so heard to understand that the solid decision is for him to move away from the disturbed person if safe to do so, and to only beat the shit out of them if not? What is it about reddit that responding with the Hammer of Thor to any physical incident is the agreed, correct action?"
cringe,3b7m13,alhaqq,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"It's just more societal bullshit; the idea that men are automatically criminals if they are seen fighting.

The huge pussy with the camera should have punched her in the back of the head when she attacked that poor guy who was minding his own business, but alas she seemed to only be concerned with the well-being of some violent banshee senselessly harming other passengers. all simply because she was a woman. Yeah, that's not totally sexist."

The woman is clearly out of her gourd, and jumping in to mob her is the worst thing to do for a psychotic individual.   And the next time you see someone high as a kite and violent, you get involved. It'd be fucking stupid to risk life and limb by enraging her further. Just call the cops, remain calm and film.   edit: it had nothing to do with the fact that the psychotic person here was a woman, it had everything to do with the fact that she was high as a kite and violent. That's not something a civilian is equipped to handle, nor should we try."
cringe,3b7m13,Freyjadour,0,Sat Jun 27 07:15:06 2015 UTC,I mean like from what I saw she wasn't a huge threat. Don't get me wrong I'm not defending her but I don't believe that at the time people thought it would escalate to what it did (a situation where security needed to be involved).  EDIT: I'm also not dismissing the fact that there is a huge social problem with how women are portrayed when they commit acts of violence (usually as the victim even when they're not) I was just speaking for this specific situation.

I was defending the passengers not asking for security people straight away as she really didn't seem like she was an immediate threat and it seemed like something that could've been solved between them two without a third party stepping in. I mean if you look at the guy he seemed pretty calm up until he came out swinging."

He could be coming back, I sure as hell don't feel safe in that situation, and you want to make sure he gets arrested.

I live in Warsaw and was travelling with people talking to themselves, singing songs very loudly, screaming incomprehensible words from time to time, banging their head on the wall, running around the bus and then pulling the emergency break etc. It's best to avoid all of them."
cringe,3b7m13,spiritualsummer,7,Fri Jun 26 23:30:52 2015 UTC,Because when you ride a subway you see weirder stuff every trip. This isn't that remarkable or out of the ordinary in a large city.
cringe,3b7m13,240Nordey,3,Sat Jun 27 01:18:51 2015 UTC,For the same reason you wouldn't have done it if you were in that subway. Because seeing someone acting like that is scary as shit. Anyone trying to do anything would have probably been strangled like that dude.
cringe,3b7m13,Vaiist,4,Sat Jun 27 09:30:52 2015 UTC,I dunno why you were downvoted. I'm probably in a city a lot smaller than in th video so it might be different... But way before she even attacked this dude it was absolutely clear this girl needed medical help. Why didn't anyone call for help? It sure seems a lot more productive than filming it.

cringe,3b7m13,DaftOdyssey,-8,Fri Jun 26 17:27:24 2015 UTC,Mental illness would be my guess. I've seen a lot of drug use. I have used a fair amount of drugs too. Never seen anything like this. Unless she got her hands on a enough pcp to overdose. I couldn't see this being drugs. PCP is also really fucking hard to find in Edmonton. I am far from an expert on mental illness and have no formal education about drugs. All of this is speculation but I just have a hard time seeing this being drugs. This is similar to how people described that schizophrenic man that cut of someone's head on a greyhound a few years back in Alberta.
cringe,3b7m13,Dr_Emmet_Brown,14,Fri Jun 26 21:14:24 2015 UTC,This is DEFINITELY drugs.

cringe,3b7m13,SnartFiffa,6,Fri Jun 26 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of people with schizophrenia will not act like this in public. Either their condition is well controlled with medications and they're living a fairly normal life or their entire lives are falling apart. You don't just wake up in the morning with schizophrenia punching you in the face, it's a gradual progression of, usually, auditory hallucinations. If the voices are telling you to hurt yourself or someone else, you might see spontaneous behavior like this. But with the way she is acting leading up to the attack, it looks much more like a stimulant/hallucinogen overdose. Acute psychosis is almost always due to drug intoxication. A schizophrenic is much more likely to show up to the doctor saying they've been hearing the voice of their dead father berating them constantly for the past few months than they are to actually attack someone in public. The Alberta case was one in a million situation.   Also, visual hallucinations are more commonly associated with this kind of aggressive/violent behaviour, and they're almost always caused by drug intoxication or alcohol withdrawal."

And then when the map is actually cued up she has to find a way to come up with something to accompany it on the spot. Instead of taking the wheel completely he should have listed a single state or two in order to buy her a few seconds to form her words.   Shit's hard enough as it is without somebody being a dick."

cringe,3b4pf6,blindbunny07,733,Thu Jun 25 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"I used to be a wedding photographer.  I'll always remember the worst goddamn DJ I had ever seen.   This was a reception only contract. The couple had been married in the islands somewhere with a small circle of friends and family and this was the big party back in the states for everybody else when they came back.  They hired a live band from a piano bar for dancing but they wanted unique entrance music for each pair of the wedding party followed by the parents and then the couple themselves. Common thing. It's a tiny dance parade and each pairing has a new song to dance to. One couple wanted ""Baby Got Back"", the next wanted ""We Are The Champions"", etc.,.  They asked the band if they had an audio tech or a laptop or someone who could do it from the provided list of songs and their order. They assured them it wouldn't be a problem at all.  They brought Steve. Steve had an iPod.  They had all the music they needed on the thing but they never made a playlist or a shortcut album or anything- each song was buried within 20GB of music sorted by album on an old clickwheel iPod.   You see where this is going.  ""Ladies and Gentlemen, if you could take your seats now, we're ready to introduce the wedding party...""  The house lights go down, two small spotlights light up. One is on the door to the hall outside, the other is on Steve. Steve is holding a visibly crumpled list of songs and an iPod.  Steve presses play and a distorted and entirely too loud voice comes out of the speakers.   ""Oh. My. God. Becky: look at her butt. It is so-""   Steve presses pause.  ""Sorry. I'm sorry.""  The emcee starts on the mic. ""....Okay..... Ready? Introducing the first pair of the wedding party... Brian and Katie!"" -""Oh. My. God. Becky: look-"" [sorry] [>>] ""BUTTS AND I CANNOT LIE, YOU OTHER BROTHERS CAN'T DENY, WHEN""  Brian and Katie do an awkward dance to a shaky spotlight, unable to find the beat when Steve tries to skip over the intro and quickly take their place in front of the floor. The guests applaud with nervous laughter.  The music cuts out abruptly and Steve apologizes again.  Emcee: ""Please welcome our next pair, Nathan and Tanya!"" -""Oh. My. God. Becky: look at-"" [sorry] [pause -> menu -> music -> artists] [sorry, I'm sorry] [Queen -> Greatest Hits] [sorry]  Nathan and Tanya are already halfway across the dancefloor walking slowly towards the line to stall for time before the opening piano chords to ""We Are The Champions"" starts blaring over the speakers.   Which you just can't dance to.  They take their place in line. The music cuts out in the middle of a word. The guests are completely silent except one quiet voice in the back with a clear ""what the fuck, dude, come on...""  Steve apologizes.  Steve clicks through several menus on the iPod, the little ""tic-tic-tic"" sound mocking the poor kid as he scrolls. It seems like it takes him a full minute to find the next song. He glances up at the emcee and nods. ""Ready."" -""You sure?"" ""Uh... yup. Sorry. Ready."" -""Next up, David and Vivian!""   ""IF-ID-HAD-NA-BEEN FA-COTTON EYE JOE, I'D BE MARRIED LONG TIME AGO...""   Vivian is furious. The music is blaring so loud, Steve doesn't hear her shouting ""Wrong song!"" until pretty much everybody joins in, shouting at Steve who is busy looking through the menus for the next song on his paper queue, trying hard to ignore the chaos around him.  The music cuts out suddenly. Steve looks scared. ""What?""  -""WRONG SONG!"" everyone screams to various degrees of frustration. He looks down at the list and asks someone behind him a question. ""Oh, David and Vivian, okay. Hold on. Sorry, okay- yeah. Wait...""  The guests all mumble hatred at Steve and the wedding party looks pissed. The drummer quickly gets up and takes the iPod away from him. He presses play.  ""IF-ID-HAD-NA-BEEN FA-COTTON EYE JOE, I'D BE MARRIED-""    The drummer apologizes.  ""Just forget it, dude."" Vivian and David walk the rest of the way to their place on the floor. Someone has propped open the door to the hallway and is joining the Maid of Honor in consoling a furious bride. The hall is quiet enough to hear the bride and groom asking what the holdup is and to have a loud groomsman relay the message ""HE'S USING A FUCKING iPOD.""   Steve and the drummer apologize. After a minute or two of distant bitching, the best man approaches Steve, whispers something angrily in his ear and Steve nods his head, searching on the iPod.   The rest of the wedding party just comes out all at once to no music and no announcement.   ""If everyone could stand and welcome the bride and groom, Jessica and Dan Miller!""  The crowd applauds and music starts booming from the speakers. ""I'VE GOT A FEELING! THAT TONIGHT'S GONNA BE A GOOD NIGHT!....""  The bride and groom stand in front of the party and wave awkwardly. The guests try to cheer over the painful music and even clap with the beat. Before anyone can start to dance, the music cuts out.  The guests groan all at once.  The bride starts to cry. The groom tries to lead her off the floor.  ""Sorry.""  tl;dr: don't hire a dude with an iPod instead of a DJ. It will hurt."

Why do you charge 2500-3k for a wedding when I can get another DJ for 500? Get that DJ for 500 and see what happens. Spend $5K on flowers and skimp out on a DJ who is going to control your whole reception. Great idea.

cringe,3b4pf6,TheIdesOfLurch,2,Fri Jun 26 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Typically it's talking to them about what you want, and then asking (or them telling you) if they can do it within your budget. As far as photographers go, they're the ones who can really guide you throughout the day, from getting ready, ceremony, family, and reception shots (and anything inbetween), so you can rely on the good ones to keep you on schedule, since they need to be ready before you get from point A to point B. That's really where the experience (and the expense) come in, not to mention their knowledge of how to make you look good during post production. In your situation, I might just go with the family route and maybe put those disposable cameras on each table.  One thing though: splurge on the photobooth. Everyone will enjoy it."

cringe,3b4pf6,IsopropylOH,2,Sat Jun 27 02:39:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's all depending on the agreement you sign with them. For all the weddings I've been to with a photobooth, the couple gets the digital copies, and the guests get however many that are printed out after each session.  If you're crafty and/or technically inclined, there are DIY solutions for photobooths that allow the guests to operate it themselves."

cringe,3b4pf6,Omnomagon,21,Fri Jun 26 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"My wife and I did our wedding for ~3k.  We were able to save in places that some people can't (we had the wedding at my family farm, we bought the food ourselves (sausages from local butcher, and standard bbq fare) and hired someone just to do the cooking).  A lot of it simply comes down to expectations and what you want your wedding to look like:   my wife was happy with a $100 dress she found on kijiji (it was simple and elegant, but not an official ""wedding dress""). I wore khakis and a button up shirt. I bought a friend who is a decent amateur photographer a new lens for his camera (~$200) to be the ""official"" photographer, but we ended up getting lots of pictures sent to us by others as well We had a campfire instead of a dance (make your own s'mores) We slept in a tent at the farm We bought a handful of lilies for the official bouquet, the rest of the flowers were centrepieces that my relatives made from wild flowers   The best part was that this was exactly the wedding that we wanted (other highlights include the bride arriving at the outdoor altar on a Honda Trail 70, picnic games for the games between the wedding and the food, and an ice cream bar for dessert).  I fully understand that most people chose to have much more extravagent events.  For us, taking a step back and realizing that what we really wanted was to have our friends with us and to have fun allowed us to not just accept, but embrace the plans we made.  I worry that many people just have the wedding they think they're expected to have, while paying through the nose to do so..."

cringe,3b4pf6,jcb5150,7,Sat Jun 27 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with others who said to figure out what really matters to you. For me, I would say that cheap carnations in less-than-elaborate bouquets would be an easy way to save money. The officiant could theoretically be a friend if they are willing to get ordained online and officiate the ceremony. Pick someone who knows how to project his/her voice, doesn't mind public speaking, but doesn't want to be the center of attention.   Photography and music are the two that cost real money and are worth real money. You don't want to Steve situation. I would put feelers out to multiple local photographers. Be very clear and upfront: ""My fiance and I are working with a very limited budget and are looking for someone who can offer us quality service at a reasonable price."" You can either state your photography budget and ask what they would be willing to do for that amount, or you can say ""all we want is a set of official posed photos after the ceremony plus a few candids during the ceremony"" or whatever you actually want, and then ask what they would charge for that. Things that raise the price are adding assistants for more coverage and having the photographer there for many hours. If you're willing to settle for fewer photos in a shorter span of time, you can save money, but be ready to have some people tell you straight-up that you can't afford them. This is the one thing that I would not hire a friend for, unless you have a friend who is actually good at this and does it very well on a regular basis (either a hobbyist that could go pro or a semi-pro who just does it as a side thing). If you don't know any of those people, just hire someone. Most people are terrible at photography.  For a DJ, honestly I would just get a friend to be your Steve except be good at it. Pick the person who is always 5 minutes early to dinner or offers to help you move and then actually shows up. Show that person this Reddit thread. Tell that person that no matter what, this cannot happen. If the person creates a few playlists (ceremony music, entrance songs, dinner music, dancing music) and takes his/her job seriously, it might not be flawless, but it won't be Steve."

It worked out great - we had a solid house playlist for the entire dance (this worked well for the crowd as well of course).   Basically, you can get away cheap with just speakers and a well thought out playlist. If you have friends with the same mind set."
cringe,3b4pf6,obmn,4,Fri Jun 26 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"The only way you can go cheap on a photographer or a dj is if you are REALLY involved. Djs and photographers pretty much run the entire wedding and reception.  If you can find a friend who takes decent pictures you can make a complete plan on when things will happen and where and how before hand.   As far as finding a cheap dj, that's a little tougher because you need someone that can at the very least read a crowd.  It's not necessary to find some amazing beatmatch dj for a wedding,  the guests aren't really going to care, especially because there are so many different genres going on in a wedding.    That being said,  if you can afford a great dj, no question,  it will be much better.   If you are going to go cheap on the dj or use a friend who doesn't do weddings, make a Spotify or YouTube playlist of a ton of songs you and your guests want to hear. (Dont let them play them streaming, make them get them before hand) Even the most basic dj should be able to put them in a decent order that the crowd will enjoy.   Also, dont forget to let the dj know if they need to do any announcements or special songs and dances and when to do them. Know before hand if you will need wired or wireless mics, know before hand what the electrical is like at your venue. There is nothing worse than getting somewhere and plugging everything in only to realize you have a loud annoying ground loop and not having any lifts or interrupts to fix it or not having enough power or available outlets for all your gear.   A professional wedding dj won't require you to do any of this, an amateur dj probably won't think of any of it. If you go cheap and you are not involved, a dj can absolutely ruin a wedding.  Also, tip the dj and photographer  when it's all said and done  (Full disclosure, I am not a professional wedding dj, but I have done weddings for friends)  If it were me and I only had 5 grand, I'd save the money, go to a JP to get married and just throw a big house party and have an awesome honeymoon."

I would start by talking to people who just recently got married and see what they paid and what their experiences were regarding the DJ. For flowers, you can do this yourself. Remember, flowers are inanimate objects that aren't really going to add to your wedding experience at all. You can get creative with centerpiece options. You don't have to blow a ton on it. I've seen weddings that used a cheap glass bowl on a table with some rocks, water, and assorted floating flowers/roses/candles/etc. Google a bit about centerpieces on a budget, a good amount of inexpensive ideas should pop up. I know you said that you already have the venue covered, but here are some separate options for you or anyone else reading. If your budget is only 5k, I would suggest renting a hall of some sort.  Knights of Columbus, Amvets, etc. You can usually get one for a couple hundred(2-400). This way you're not going to have to pay per head. The hall usually provides tables and chairs. You can buy some cheap table cloths for the tables if catering does not supply them. For food, find a catering business that's close to you. For this you will have to give a head count so they can prepare the correct amount of food. If the caterer does not include alcohol, you can do this yourself as well. Hire a bartender that you know for $100 to work 4-5 hours plus tips. Explain your situation to them and they should work with you. You can buy the alcohol yourself in bulk at a costco/BJ's/SamsClub or one of those types of stores. Buy the jug size of typical hard alcohol (vodka/gin/rum/whiskey/etc). For an officiant, I've seen people get town mayor to legally marry them for nothing. If not, you should be able to find someone online in your area. Just tell them to keep it short if you're not too keen on them. As for a photographer, talk to your friends and others you know who have recently had a wedding. Get the photographers number and meet with them. Ask them to bring some type of portfolio to show recent work. Look up reveiws of them online. It's best to find someone who is starting out in the business. Anyone that is somewhat established is most likely going to be charging 2-3k. The most important thing is to make sure they know how to properly operate a camera and a decent amount of experience doing it. They also need to have good equipment as well. I'm sure you have at least one friend who is into photography. Ask him/her for help. This person will also know others that are into photography as well. Through this network of people you should be able to find someone that will give you a break on price. It might not be masterpiece work, but it should be decent. Now back to the DJ. You asked about music. The type of music depends on you/your partner/your friends. Tell the DJ what type of music you guys are into. Also tell hiim what you specifically don't want played. A good DJ will feel out the crowd and play music accordingly. This is a big part of being a good DJ. You give him preferences, specifics, and let them roll with it. For this reason alone is why you are going to have to talk to people who have recently had a wedding and thought their DJ was great. If they really like their DJ, they will rant and rave about him. If they weren't too happy, you'll know. It usually goes either way. No one says, ""our DJ was ok"". If they say that, that typically means they were unhappy. Start networking with all recently married couples and ask them to ask their friends for references as well. You will find someone for a decent price. One more thing, if you are having 75 people at your wedding, make sure the dance floor area is small. A dance floor must always fit the venue/guest size. Too big of a dance floor will make the floor always seem empty. You want a dance floor that fits and always seems packed. People are generally more into going on a packed floor than a seemingly empty one. Let me know if you have any more questions or anything else that I didn't touch on. Remember, it's not about how much money you spend on a wedding. It all depends on the energy from the loved ones you invite. They will bring the party. I've seen weddings that cost over 200k and sucked ass compared to small hall weddings that completely blew the doors off and kicked ass. The DJ is important, but the people you invite are more important."

cringe,3b4pf6,whotaketh,5,Fri Jun 26 17:29:02 2015 UTC,"Not being from the states, these rates seem crazy. Can a DJ clear $10k a month? On 4 nights of work? Seems pretty lucrative."
cringe,3b4pf6,obmn,5,Fri Jun 26 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"Typically, those rates are for the most high end Djs that bring more than just speakers and music - they bring lighting, stage setups, screens, etc.  These kind of rates are also more likely to happen in large markets with weddings that have large budgets.  Another thing to consider is that weddings and most mobile DJing is very seasonal work.  Spring and summer is wedding season, winter is corporate holiday parties and you get school dances around spring as well.  So while clearing 10k a month is certainly possible at these rates, it's not necessarily happening year round."
cringe,3b4pf6,dj_soo,2,Sat Jun 27 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"Not just any wedding DJ. I know a guy who charges about $6-7,000 per wedding. He's not the DJ, he's the MC. It's all about the control of the party. So yes, a DJ can clear more than 10k/month."
cringe,3b4pf6,VaporChicken,3,Mon Jun 29 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"Our wedding was on a pretty tight budget, but the DJ was the single biggest expense, and it was worth every penny. It was a fantastic husband/wife team, he was the dj/mc, and she actually assisted us with the wedding planning and acted as coordinator on-site the day of. Super professional, gave us exactly what we wanted, and even had some surprises for my wife and I that went over huge with the crowd.   We had the advantage of foresight though. About a year prior to our own, we attended one of my cousins weddings. Huge budget, spent a ton on the venue (winery in California wine country), food, etc. But they skimped on the DJ, and oh my god he was horrible. Not steve-with-an-ipod horrible, but close. It helped us realize how important a good DJ was."

Do you have 5 hours of fun dancing music, 2-3 hours of slow dinner music, free from any intros, swear words, or sound errors? Do you have 2 dozen unique songs this person wants to hear queued and ready to go?  Do you have a microphone setup and know how to attenuate the gain so everyone can hear the speaker easily but avoid feedback?  That's just the beginning, look up how much renting a soundsystem costs. . ."

cringe,3b4pf6,TheIdesOfLurch,7,Fri Jun 26 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Especially for a wedding, a DJ is really more of an MC and has to do introductions, games and must prepare and be skilled for all of this. You have to adjust the levels for the venue. There are a ton of things they have do behind the scenes. Equipment breaks, have to bring back ups just in case. Now if you are djing a house party for $500 for some drunk college kids, that's a good gig for a DJ.  Also, DJs that actually mix the music together vs fading in and out actually takes skill. Although a lot less these days with computers and sync button.   Also they may loading hundreds of pounds through some horrible venues with tiny elevators or none at all. One of my worst was doing a gig on the Queen Mary ship (lighting only).  Loading and unloading equipment can be a job itself."
cringe,3b4pf6,mediocrefunny,6,Fri Jun 26 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"I DJ for club and parties that people actually pay to go to, with my name on a flyer, and would be terrified to be a wedding DJ. Apart from bringing his own sound system, instead of a laptop with X1/F1 or just a pair of usb sticks, like me, he has to bring an enormous collection of tracks to suit every possible request, and to know all of them. He has to not only read the crowd, but to know who is who and to see inter-personal dynamics of people he sees for the first time ever. He has to love all kinds of music, be able to mix tango into IDM, play in completely unprepared rooms while controlling the levels, be civil and welcoming to guests who carry drinks near his equipment (my worst pet peeve, I lash out at fellow DJs for that), and make it look like it's the beat night of his life too.  Being a club DJ can be enjoyable. Being a wedding DJ is FUCKING HARD."

But it's a very thankful job, and I love it."
cringe,3b4pf6,Fleebix,5,Fri Jun 26 21:46:00 2015 UTC,Turns out the dj basically runs the wedding reception. You want someone who is a skilled mc in addition to just having a good playlist.

My friend got married and I couldn't make it but it was all relayed to me about a week later.  First, during dinner, the DJ announced that she would be taking requests. Everybody got up to request dance tunes. These were not played during the dance part though. They were played during dinner. ""That's disappointing,"" thought everybody.  Next, during the father-daughter-dance, the bride had chosen a rather long instrumental. With about two minutes left, the DJ said, over the mic ""do you want me to keep going or should I just cut it?""  Now dancing begins with the Chicken Dance (really!?). fortunately enough people go with it that it isn't that terrible. Now, DJ decides to pass a rubber chicken around like a hot potato. At the end a girl is holding it who is not comfortable with being at the mercy of a crazy DJ so she fast balls it in the direction of the best man who catches it easily.   This is where it get's weird. ""If you want to be a good sport about it,"" she says to BM, ""I have this to wear for the next song."" It's a huge chicken suit. The next song is the Hokey Pokey!  At this point everybody has decided that the DJ is garbage, but the next song is Cupid Shuffle. This leads to everybody being tired. To keep them from sitting down, DJ plays three slow songs in a row.   After this is some more request. Each one is preceded by the phrase ""this is a request so, sorry if you don't like it.""   Bride and Groom weren't terribly mad when all was said and done because they have a very strong sense of humor, but they won't be recommending that DJ to anyone else."

I was handed an old ipod shuffle and a list of songs on a crumpled piece of paper, hurried into the back room of the church and shown where the PA system was.  I had a few seconds to test the volume, and then the ceremony started. The problem was that I couldn't even see what was happening outside of my little room, so the priest would just give hand signals to tell me when to change the songs, when to fade out etc.  The whole time I was stressing out because the songs were mixed in with assorted Slipknot and Rammstein, one wrong click and I would have ruined everything...

Even if you didn't like the sound of American Idiot, it was pretty well thought out with overarching themes and riffs. Maybe not a masterpiece but I can think of a lot of pop albums that sucked WAY harder. And - sellouts or not - Green Day can put on a really fun show."

It was an absolutely massive records that millions upon millions of people love.   Is it the best record ever? Of course not. But just because Green Day got pretty shameless and ""sold out"" doesn't mean the record was objectively bad."
cringe,3b3lwh,shredderrrrrr,7,Fri Jun 26 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Glad someone agrees with me. I wasn't expecting to be received well, but I loved that record when I was younger before I became a musician and now I listen to it from a different perspective and there's honestly a few epic songs on there that made me respect Green Day a lot more... Whatshername is still my favorite song of theirs.... And I loved the eyeliner comment... I don't think these kids realize Green Day were far from the first band to rock eyeliner...."
cringe,3b3lwh,Photo_Synthetic,4,Fri Jun 26 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I still get chills listening to Whatsername.  I apologize for the incoming wall of text, but you really got me thinking about this.   I think it is unfortunately a generational thing where American Idiot will be loved by only a certain segment of people. What's annoying is that I think this is largely because of things like marketing.   For older people that were around when Dookie came out, Green Day was ""cool."" Then American Idiot came out and Green Day was viewed as ""selling out"" and made people yearn for the ""old"" Green Day. This group generally thus don't think fondly of the album. For younger Redditors, Green Day has always been the mainstream rock band that you would hear in department stores and see the merchandise sold in malls--which is certainly not very ""cool."" They see Green Day as a commercial group that is not genuine and is akin to the likes of Nickleback (or any other group that is popular to hate on based on mass appeal).   For many people like me (and I suspect you) in their 20s or 30s, American Idiot holds a special place in their heart. Why? Because we were at an influential age when the album came out and were swept up in all the praise and attention it got at the time. To us, Green Day was cool (because we didn't yearn for Dookie-era Green Day and weren't born when the band's popularity had faded). When I talk to people my age, American Idiot is far and away the most commonly cited source for getting ""in"" to music. It was a perfect album to expose teenage kids to rock/punk. Everyone loved the album at the time when we were exposed to it--it was really powerful. Hell, it got me into rock music and convinced me to learn guitar.   These differing perspectives necessarily influence how the album itself is viewed by each person. To us, the album is epic and kicks ass--largely because we've grown up loving it! But to people without that experience and those memories, the album is judged more critically. When you consider how subjective music taste is and how powerful nostalgia is, I can't say this is surprising. Of course someone born ten years after a politically-charged album was released won't relate much to it. And that's alright. I don't expect everyone on Reddit to love it. I just get frustrated when people say the album sucks as if it is some objective truth."

At that point perhaps Ashley may have thought there was a delay and they could go back and start over with the correct song and by that point it was a lost cause.

This is just music put together by corporations who do market research about what will be most catchy.  They hire decent musicians to write the tunes and they hire someone like Ashley Simpson to be the figure head. It doesn't matter how she sings in real life because there is software that can make her sound ""good"" especially after 1000 takes. People should listen to real music, from independent labels. There is real rap, real jazz, real country/bluegrass, real R&B, real heavy metal, out there. Don't be lazy schmucks and listen to Ashley Simpson and the like."

So sure you may take it very seriously, this guy may take it seriously but I've known people that do Jiu Jitsu here in Brasil that scoff at the belt system. My point is, the guy's making an asshat of himself regardless because what is SUPER important to you might not be super important to someone else. That doesn't give the right to the other guy for lying about his skill level (because he might be seriously injured when sparring against another black belt) but his whole speech came off more about the holy and intrinsic value of the black belt more than the lack of respect for his sparring partners.  If it was me I'd not say the whole part about ""you know how long it took me to get one of these"" and spent more time talking about ""what if I had broken your arm because I thought you could take it, I don't need none of that shit in my or anyone else in this gym conscience just because you don't give a damn"".

cringe,3b5poo,puzzlednerd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:02:18 2015 UTC,"The key here is black belt in what.  Against BJJ, not a chance.  If you want to see how striking vs grappling works out, look at the early days of the UFC, before people realized you had to be good at both to succeed.    For a more recent example, look at Randy Couture vs James Toney.  Granted, Randy Couture is also a decent striker, but notice how effortlessly he takes him down at the beginning, and then James Toney looks like a fish out of water once the fight is on the ground.  That's how grappler vs striker matchups usually look."

When Randy went for his lower body, he might have well went for a punch to the face as Randy is quick.   Not sure what was going on with James.   I'm thinking he wasn't necessarily prepared for a launch to the lower body.   Not making up for his loss, but criticizing him.   He wasn't very quick for sure.   EDIT:  Wow, looking at the vid again, James should have never went into that ring.   I guess that's what happens when you get a big head on your shoulders."

Now, there have also been people who went from boxing/kickboxing/etc into mma very successcully, but they need to at least become literate in grappling first.    That all being said, I may have sort of missed the point of your original comment.  You are right in the sense that if two people came up to me, one of them said ""I'm a black belt"" and the other said ""I'm a boxer"" then just based on that information I would bet on the boxer.  As /u/papsie mentioned in another comment, there are a lot of cupcake black belts out there in various martial arts.  A BJJ black belt is a different story though."

cringe,3b5poo,papsie,12,Fri Jun 26 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"You have to understand the culture to see why this reaction is perfectly reasonable.   In the 70s/80s, a ton of guys (a lot of them old vets with enough training to look showy)  tried to capitalize on the martial arts craze in the U.S by opening martial arts academies and passing themselves off as black belts of karate, kung fu or a vaguely asian sounding system they invented (ninjitsu lol).   These McDojo academies were springing up everywhere and raking in crazy money by promoting people willy nilly (12yo blackbelts) and over time made legitimate academies look like a joke by proxy. Karate, TKD and others to this day have significant quality control problems.  BJJ as a direct response to this prides itself on not allowing places like this to dilute the amount of skill required to achieve each rank. A black belt is usually achieved through an average of 7-15 years of very hard training. At this point, you can drop in to any academy in the world and be confident that your skill level is demonstrable. Some guys at this point open their own academy and start teaching.  When some clown comes in pretending to be a black belt, he's not only pissing on the hard work, he is presenting his skill set to others as representative of what that much work looks like in your art, something that you now base your livelihood and professional reputation on. It has to be shut down hard, and very publicly. Watch it again with this in mind, that's why at the end he talks about 'these guys are legit, if you train in my gym you have to be legit too.'  TL,Dr;  Other arts let shit like this slide and it annihilated them."

Odds are they have never and will never see actual combat.   http://www.businessinsider.com/most-dangerous-jobs?op=1  Military doesn't make the top 15. My dad worked as a roofing contractor for over half a century and was hospitalized from related injuries a few times. It all came out of pocket. He currently receives veteran benefits thanks to a 5 year tour of duty as a naval photographer during the Vietnam war. He contributed vastly more to society as a roofer than as a member of the US military. I live in a town with a huge air force presence and can guarantee that the vast majority of the US soldiers get back more than they put in.  I've also been a server at a restaurant that chose not to offer a military discount and the sense of entitlement and disgust I'd see on the faces of military personnel when they found out was always a bit off-putting.   That being said, I briefly considered joining up. I even took the aptitude test which was jokingly easy to 17-year-old me. The benefits are great and the respect is a definite plus.

cringe,3b5poo,doublefarq,0,Mon Jun 29 06:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah in this situation I can see how they were being douche bags for no reason. However, on the other argument of veterans not deserving huge recognition I have to disagree with you. Don't get me wrong I am hugely against glorifying war or anything like that, this movie wholeheartedly put me off that forever. But (and especially with wars that had conscription) you should acknowledge the horrors of war that can lead to things like PTSD and various other mental/health issues. Not only that but in reality stopping a country from becoming a super power or invading your country is far more significant than tiling a roof, and I don't mean any disrespect when I say that. My father is a concreter and he's seen friends fall five stories to their death and people getting their limbs torn off by machinery, as a matter of fact death is something that is everywhere in the trades industry. I see the problem being in the government recognizing military persons far more than people who have seen the same things but didn't voluntarily sign up for a blood bath.  What I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't disrespect soldiers because the problems they face are very real and I completely see where you're coming from with them getting a ridiculous amount of bonuses but I think it seems that way because noone else is really treated on the same level as them and that is a purely social/governmental problem. I believe respect and recognition should be given to far more jobs than just the military. I mean who built those restaurants that are giving out those discounts?"
cringe,3b5poo,hippiehulk,3,Sun Jun 28 03:25:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely didn't mean to suggest that a country's armed forces are less necessary than a subset of its tradespeople. I was referring specifically to my father's contribution to the Vietnam War as a photographer versus his contribution to society in general as a roofer. His roofing career was certainly more important than his Navy career.   I think most people would agree that there are grounds to call the US military excessive. It's a pretty well known fact that our military spending is greater than the next seven combined (and most are allies). Conflicts around the world are pretty low historically. I would go as far as to say that an individual logger actually is more necessary for the continuation of society than an individual soldier (at least by today's standards). The inventor of the modern drone is a private citizen who has contributed immensely more to the US military than practically any single soldier. Where's his 10%?  I have a ton of sympathy and respect for soldiers who are killed, maimed, or psychologically damaged by active combat. The thing of it is though, the vast majority of military personnel are not participating in active combat and never will. Society's rush to assume that all military personnel are heroic hardened combat veterans is what bothers me. It's not impossible to make a distinction between someone who filed papers in a US military base in Germany and someone who fought on the front lines in Iraq and this distinction SHOULD be made.   I also agree that the problem does not stem from soldiers per se, but from personal experience I believe that soldiers often reinforce it, such as the soldiers who feel it necessary to call out impersonators who are often really just pathetic; not evil. It's sort of a self feeding loop and that's why I think the best way to describe it is entitlement. Society says they deserve special treatment with billboards, bumper stickers, and political speeches which makes them believe they are, in fact, somehow above regular citizens. The two guys in the video are just as guilty of ""stealing valor"" in my opinion because they demand the same recognition soldiers who sacrifice their lives on the front lines deserve. Bootcamp is definitely tough but it doesn't put anyone in significant mortal danger.   There's a sort of Captain America mythology around the Military and while there are individuals who do choose to serve their country out of pure patriotism, they are rare. It's a career decision in the vast majority of situations. It's called volunteering even when there is no draft or war. It's like saying a lawyer volunteers to prosecute criminals when he actually chooses a career in criminal prosecution.  To answer your last question, the restaurant was owned by Koreans who had spent the last few years in West Virginia and weren't keen to the local obsession with the armed forces. The owner always said that he chose fair prices and they would apply to all customers. I respected him for it but I know he lost business from military and non-military families alike because he didn't recognize military discounts as the sort of quirky American courtesy that they are."

Someone made a joke about how she should run for president during the run-up to the last election, and they got in touch with her to see if she'd star in a little skit about the idea. She said yes, they sent her a script.  On the day of the filming they turned up at her place, and she was really nice. She made perfect grilled (ham and cheese?) sandwiches for them herself, knew every line and had even practiced her delivery. They were surprised and impressed with her.  So, I guess people may be misjudging her. And/or the ditziness may be an act."
cringe,3b2sol,AttackTribble,24,Thu Jun 25 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"I believe that the ditziness is, at least in part (and more likely, mostly), part of her schtick.  It kept her in the news and adjusted the frame of perception of people who would have otherwise been intimidated/turned-off by a rich, pretty, successful woman.    She may be somewhat authentically ditzy but I think she plays it up full force because it's part of her ""brand"".  Someone like her, whose life-at-large is part-and-parcel to her ""brand"", has tons of advisers who have tons of market research about how she should act in public to shift public perception towards a state that will serve to increase the value of said brand.    Put it this way, if the ditzy act didn't sell, she wouldn't be acting that way and we, the masses, wouldn't even think of her as ditzy -- even if she truly was 100% authentically ditzy."

cringe,3b2sol,Teggert,33,Fri Jun 26 17:56:28 2015 UTC,I think the only cringey part is when she says she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. Her composure is really stretched thin at that point.

What I don't understand is how Paris and her Publicist didn't know David was going to be asking her about jail. Surely she agreed to certain talking points before hand so it can't be a total surprise. Maybe David took it further than was agreed? I'm curious.
cringe,3b2sol,BoneMachineNo13,11,Thu Jun 25 20:15:54 2015 UTC,I guarantee her publicist gave Letterman some pre-approved topics and Paris did a pre-interview and Letterman just threw them in the trash and decided to go off the cuff because the topics he was limited to would be intolerable to take seriously - her clothing line and perfume are not interesting to talk about.

He's not there to strike blows at oppression, he's there to be funny and relevant. When someone awful comes on the show he makes fun of them for their shit, he's providing a catharsis relief for those of us sick of celebrity pandering and ass kissing. If he had Henry Kissenger on and sternly lectured him on not committing war crimes, it wouldn't be anything new, it wouldn't really do any good, and crucial to the point of his show- it wouldn't be funny.

I know I know, he spews misinformation and panders to the public, but I can't help but feel impressed with his whole persona or character. He's quick on his feet, and knows exactly which emotions to convey to conn ect with the audience. This is one of my favorite videos about O'Reily, the title of the video is ""Jon Stewart Exposes Jon Reily's stupidity"", but that is a bullshit clickbait title. First of all you've got to be a moron to think this man is ""stupid"", he's exactly the opposite of that. Now watch this video, his argument is insane... Jon Stewart being the smart man he is doesn't shy away from O'Reily's strategy of talking over his opponent's arguments and place himself on a higher moral ground (you can clearly see that both of them clearly respect each other as well). As the interview continues and Stewart is doing a good job of mocking O'Reily's insane arguments, so Bill makes lighthearted comic statements that play off on his serious persona like ""The Weather Girls"" being one of his favorite groups. It doesn't do a good job of proving his point but it does a great job of breaking the ice and making him more likeable to the audience.  In short, I am genuinely intrigued by Bill O'Reily and I too think like Jon Stewart that he's way better than what Fox uses him for.... but it makes him tons of money so meh.... who am I to judge."

Not to mention that the idea of a ""trigger warning"" has grown from something that used to be literally a safety issue to avoid setting off vets with PTSD, to now include every sensitive snowflake who believes she has a right to be sheltered from ideas she doesn't like solely because they hurt her feelings, and she ""literally can't even"".  The idea that these trigger warnings for ""hurtful words"" even exist on the same plane of legitimacy as actual PTSD trigger warnings is laughable, but our culture now encourages and expects people to censor each other, and treat what are, essentially, arbitrary preferences and the risk of hurt feelings, as perfectly equivalent to someone who hears a car backfire and needs to be talked into putting the gun down for the next 3 hours."

cringe,3b1b3a,Seakawn,2,Thu Jun 25 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"Well, when you consider how the media works, it's actually really quite sensible that Bernie isn't getting enough (positive) coverage for the majority of Americans to know who he is, much less know that he is the best candidate.  Not to say that the media is sensible for the interests of most Americans. Just that the media is sensible for their own interests, and it makes sense that not many people are informed of Bernie and his policies.  Despite polls coming out making Bernie looking better and better over time... I'm just pessimistic and think that the corporate world and media will work together strongly enough to suppress his coverage overall. And there will be people in a Bernie Bubble who thinks that he's gonna win by a landslide, when really, it was just the news/social bubbles they were in to give this false illusion.  I think Bernie being President would be the best thing for this country that I can remember (I'm only 25). I'm just so cynical as to how politics works and how his policies works against Big Money, and I think it's Big Money who has the power to not let him stand a chance. If you have money, you can corrupt any and every system to get what you want. And nobody with money, not enough anyway, wants Bernie to win when he's against their primary interests."

It's not so much the literal meaning of what he said as it's his implications for one. He makes it seem as if he is just a regular host to a party kicking someone out of his house. When in reality this is at the White House of the President of the United States, and it's anything but casual.   Secondly, it's funny for how he says it too. The way he explains himself isn't very formal. Many times people in a position like a President can speak very stuffy. It's very political. Instead, he explains himself very matter of fact and on a basic level. Obama is known for being an eloquent speaker, so his ability to gauge his message and communication like this humanizes him—makes him more relatable.   I got a little long-winded but things can be funny for various reasons, and I think this instance definitely has multiple factors."

He said fine and left, and I'm even pretty sure some of the housemates would put the wire back in and watch sometimes, still no problems.  This year at our new apartment with my best friend the guy came by and we admittedly kind of freaked out because we didn't know what he'd think about our projector even though we didn't have a TV. He just said ""it's a good idea to let me in because someone else will just come by and he might be an asshole"". Dude literally just stepped in far enough to see we did indeed not have a TV, asked us if we ever watch TV from our laptops (we said no) and he kindly told us to have a nice day.

cringe,3b2871,Ne0nBlur,7,Thu Jun 25 22:53:17 2015 UTC,"In the UK (and most of Europe and a few other places in East Asia), you require a TV licence to watch live television broadcasts. It costs £145.50 per annum and primarily pays towards the BBC, keeping it ad-free and generously well funded.  It's legal to watch catch-up and on-demand services and to own a TV without a licence (exclusively for DVDs, Netflix or gaming), but if you're using it for live TV then you need a licence.  Most households in the UK have a licence, but TV Licencing occasionally send inspectors to  properties where the occupants have either declared that they do not require a TV Licence, or no licence has been purchased. They are not police officers or bailiffs and cannot enter a property without a court warrant; in the grand scheme of things, very few people are actually prosecuted for Licence fee evasion.  As a concept, it's become a little outdated with the rise of cable/satellite TV, on-demand services and online streaming, and there's now a growing political consensus that the Licence must either be abolished or fundamentally changed in the near future."

They try to come in and inspect your house and get you to explain your situation as to why you don't need a license etc...  if they are unsuccessful and are turned away at the door, which is what usually happens, they'll come back some time later, rinse and repeat.    All these people in the homes have done is have the audacity not to own a tv license and pay the BBC tax, which isn't mandatory if you don't watch TV.     Basically the BBC stupid and it's archaic TV licensing system is barely enforcable and hasn't evolved with the times, so it resorts to this sillyness."

""no"" ""ok [check] do you use your laptops to watch it?"" ""no"" ""Ok [check] have a nice day!"" Never felt bullied, though I was scared at first because I'm not from around here and didn't know what to expect.

cringe,3b1jxt,IndecentName,45,Thu Jun 25 12:46:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are making fun of him for reacting to the loud noise but don't understand what's going on here. The real cringe here is the lack of safety. Hearing protection is extremely important whenever you're shooting and hearing loss is very easy to receive when you're not wearing it. This video shows what happens when two idiots don't respect firearms.  Steve's shooting a 5.56 rifle which produces somewhere around 165 decibels of noise at the muzzle. That's enough to cause permanent hearing damage without hearing protection. Next, Tom is wearing his hearing protection incorrectly which means that it might as well not be there. It's not forming a seal around his ears to protect from noise and I doubt the reduction would be more than 3-6db. Next, Steve's rifle has a muzzle break on it that vents gases and pressure to the sides. That pressure is venting right in line with Tom's ears. They're also in a confined space that will contain all the pressure to make this even worse.  So Steve shoots a 5.56 rifle inside an enclosed space with his muzzle break venting towards Tom's ears while Tom wears his hearing protection in a way he thinks makes him look cool for the camera. Tom gets 165db of sound pressure on his eardrums and it's made all the worse due to the reverberation of the blind. Tom likely receives permanent hearing loss and a concussion, Steve's ears probably start ringing unless he's wearing earplugs and earmuffs, and we get a lesson in firearm safety.  What would have made this safer? If Tom and Steve wore earplugs + earmuffs properly, they would have a safe amount of noise reduction to shoot rifles. When shooting in the blind, they should have put the muzzle outside of the blind to minimize the amount of noise in the blind. A suppressor could possibly be used to eliminate the need for one of the extra levels of hearing protection, but supersonic 5.56 is still too dangerous to shoot without ear protection, even suppressed."

cringe,3b1jxt,Dwarfman222,3,Fri Jun 26 01:07:22 2015 UTC,Something that might have contributed could have been that Steve had his muzzle inside the blind. Not resting out of the blind like Tom does. And Steve needs to be a bit more safe with his trigger finger.

Even with earpro, firing inside a confined space creates a lot of pressure that you can FEEL and can cause temporary hearing loss. Yeah, the guy is a crybaby. But it's definitely startling when it happens. First time I ever shot in a confined space (through a barrel, simulating an obstacle, at 100m) it made me jump.  The only time I had felt that pressure was when a rifle with a brake was fired beside me. You can feel that gas even 10ft away."

cringe,3az0wb,ViaFF3,663,Thu Jun 25 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely well-rounded cringe.  Not only is it a video about Bobby Jindal announcing his presidential bid, which is sufficient cringe in itself, but the video seems like one of those ""fake-candid"" pre-planned videos. Pretty sure he and his wife planned out a script.   Next, Bobby thought it'd be a great idea to announce this as if he and his wife are about to have a child or they're about to go to Disney World.   To add on to this excellent cringe, his kids really didn't give a fuck about it nor were they remotely surprised. I feel like Bobby was initially expecting his kids to fall out of their seats with pure thrill and excitement, but instead he was met with stone cold faces of zero emotion.   Finally, he decides to focus on why his kids love Iowa and they literally gave the shittiest answer ever and it almost seems as though he doesn't have a close relationship with his kids.  Overall, superb cringe. Well rounded in all facets. The LeBron James of cringe."

There's no way anyone from Eton, Oxford, and the Bullingdon Club would ever act like that bumbling wholeheartedly (Look at the likes of Cameron and Osbourne for people like that), and it's scary how one man's simple act overshadows everything else about him."

Friendly reminder to everyone that:   Boris Johnson's eighth greatgrandfather was King George II David Cameron's 5th greatgrandfather was King William IV And George Osborne is heir to a Baronetcy dating back to the 1600's   These people are aristocracy.

This isn't a left/right issue, it's an elitist issue that Labour and the Conservatives both suffer from in their own ways. It's just the Tories are especially blatant."

But truth be told I honestly don't trust him, and I don't trust a portion of the current cabinet either.  The current examples off the top of my head of him doing shady and extremely out of touch things would be things like allowing a Chinese Business Firm previously known for violating Human Rights, calling a £250,000 salary not enough.  I know that the majority of Tabloids are right-wing so it doesn't really pop up, but it's just odd that Ed Miliband got flack for something his father said, while things like this seemingly get glossed over immediately."

There is a thread of scientism in modern public discourse though and Lawrence Krauss is a pretty perfect shining example of it.  Most scientists are like you, they take a reasonable and healthy view of the benefits and limitations of science.  Unfortunately some of the more public supposed spokespeople for science don't share your moderation."
cringe,3az1ds,hepheuua,3,Thu Jun 25 00:02:44 2015 UTC,Honest questions:  a thread of scientism   What does this mean?  some of the more public supposed spokespeople   Can you give me some examples?
cringe,3az1ds,blankenstaff,-2,Thu Jun 25 00:55:38 2015 UTC,"I see scientism as the position that a) scientific knowledge is the only worthwhile way of enquiring and learning about the world and/or b) that science (and the scientific method) is not just applicable to all other fields of enquiry, but either currently, or eventually, cashes them out.  And I see this attitude both explicitly and implicitly in various public thinkers and the public more broadly (as a result, I suggest).  At its most extreme it's the idea that everything can be reduced to physics.  Lawrence Krauss is an example I've already given.  Sam Harris is another one in a similar vein.  Physics has always been replete with reductionists, like Hawking, etc.  They're of the explicit variety, but even to a degree people like Niel deGrasse Tyson, I would argue, bring with them a flavour of scientism that is perhaps more implicit than Krauss and Harris, but still discernible.  The attitude of the day, generally, is one that sees the success of science and dismisses anything that isn't science, like art, philosophy, etc, as 'bullshit' that isn't worth anyone's time.  I find that really disappointing, really misguided, and quite damaging culturally.  Of course a truly scientistic view is pretty ridiculous and people look pretty silly when they try and defend it, which is why when people like Krauss and Harris are called on it they do the old bait and switch and simply expand the definition of science to a point where it becomes rather meaningless.  But as soon as no one's looking they're back working with the narrower definition and making subtle claims that seep in to the public consciousness by virtue of their status as rather public spokespeople."
cringe,3az1ds,hepheuua,2,Thu Jun 25 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the definition. Personally, I know of no one who fits this definition.  I haven't paid attention to the people you mention, other than Hawking. As a physicist, I'll say that Tyson is an astronomer. And I'll say that yes, Hawking is reductionist, which is appropriate, as physics is a reductionist science by its nature. There's nothing wrong with that...  ...and then we get to your last paragraph. I hate the attitude you describe these people as having. However, I suspect that you may misunderstand at least some of them. Scientists, especially physicists, are...not necessarily known for their social skills. We come off as arrogant, even when, I swear, we're not being arrogant. (And when we are...)  Long story short, most of us don't think science is the only way to think about things. And, most of us feel that there is not enough science-thinking in our policy- and decision-making (yep, I'm looking at you, climate change)."
cringe,3az1ds,blankenstaff,-1,Thu Jun 25 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"As a physicist, I'll say that Tyson is an astronomer. And I'll say that yes, Hawking is reductionist, which is appropriate, as physics is a reductionist science by its nature. There's nothing wrong with that...   But that's entirely missing my point.  My problem isn't with physicists being reductionist in physics, it's when they apply that reductionism to, well, everything.  In other words it's a claim that in principle all fields of enquiry will or do collapse in to physics, that eventually sociology will be physics, psychology will be physics, biology will be physics, etc.  It's the claim that art and philosophy are fun but entirely useless.  It's a dismissal of anything but physics (or science more broadly for that matter) as providing any really valuable knowledge or ways of looking at the world.  I'm not begrudging a physicist using reductionism to study physics - it's when someone over-reaches with those tools to dismiss everything else that I have a problem with.  I find it an impoverished, and fundamentally incorrect, view.  Yes, people with those views do exist.  Are they the norm in science?  Absolutely not.  But they're sometimes far more vocal in the public sphere.   However, I suspect that you may misunderstand at least some of them.   That's possible.  I have, however, spent quite a large portion of my life and my career trying to understand them.     Long story short, most of us don't think science is the only way to think about things.   Right and none of my comments are directed at you or others who feel this way.  It's directed at those who I feel hold the attitudes I'm talking about.  To be clear I have a background in both science and philosophy.  I'm not anti-science.  I agree with your last point that we need more science in policy decisions, no problem there.  I'm anti scientism."

cringe,3az1ds,blankenstaff,-1,Thu Jun 25 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"Ok let's ignore the empathy portion...  How on earth is it so-what that science cannot measure beauty? That's a very fundamental insight which spearheads this debate, which the scientists do indeed reject. The non-Krauss scientist says explicitly that beauty itself is measurable, implicitly denying that the non-physical world of forms as a more substantial reality than the world of sensory measurements.  In terms of relevancy to the debate, the non-physical world of forms which the mustache guy references is quite fundamentally tied up with a notion of God in the classical metaphysical sense. Talking about the nature of beauty is of course relevant in a discussion about how we come to know God.  Of course not all scientists believe everything real comes in data form, but it is certainly a deeply-rooted plague within the history of science, and even those who say they don't believe that can betray their empirical bias."

cringe,3avtgm,Thotsakan,3,Wed Jun 24 05:51:58 2015 UTC,"It's very obvious that conspiracies occur. The thing that is almost comical about conspiracy nuts is that they completely disregard the conspiracies we can prove are occurring and focus on nebulous secret societies with unknown agendas.   It even goes so far as claiming that those working against the real provable conspiracies are themselves motivated by some conspiracy.   Take climate change. On the one hand we have a huge portion of scientists stating that our pollution is causing environmental changes. On the other we have a small minority of scientists and many politicians saying our pollution is negligible... And actively working against changing our levels of pollution.   The conspiracy theorists tend to believe that the entire concept of climate change is itself a tactic to control our behavior for some unknown, or far fetched reasons. Meanwhile,  they end up working for the real conspiracy that is entirely motivated by money. Companies that pollute stand to lose a lot if they are forced to stop... They choose to pay off politicians, and fund bullshit research to ensure their profits remain as high as possible. We have seen it done with tobacco, so it is obvious. Yet they are determined to find some deeper meaning underneath it all.   Most real conspiracies can be traced back to a monetary motive. It's not that complicated."

I was a ski lift operator for 10 years, on top of operating a giant machine with hundreds of people's lives in my hands, I constantly had to deal with people screaming right in my face for any number of reasons, usually centered around them trying to justify why they shouldn't need to pay the ticket price.  On numerous occasions I even had to physically defend myself from people who wanted to attack me for something they deemed unfair, typically it was the parents of ski racers who wanted to hold the lift operators accountable for their kid losing a race.  The trick is to put yourself in the role of a parent whose toddler is having a temper tantrum.  Let the person vent all they want, then just calmly ask if they're ready to act like an adult yet and watch them go into a full on rage.  People can be really funny when they're angry."

Managing people's emotions, appealing to them, and crisis-level problem solving is extremely easy when someone is standing right in front of you. They get irrational, then you talk them down. People don't like being gawked at in public by other shoppers. On the phone? After being on hold for a half hour? By themselves? And they can't see your face/what you're doing/your expressions as you're sincerely trying to explain how you're helping them? It's insanity. I have to tip my hat to call center longtimers. I quit after two months, having spent years in retail hell.  At least with customers in real life, my next person in line would be extra accomodating because they personally saw what I'd just been through. Every single person in a call queue spends the whole wait period planning in explicit detail every word of their overdramatic Academy speech, and they all think they're the only one who's going to be the ""bad customer"" of the day.

He had only thrown it once before in practice for an upcoming segment and they told him to throw it with more force. The vid you see is edited showing the Televised portion of the throw and then edited to a portion that was taken on someone’s phone of us being videoed. The part that was actually televised showed the overthrown axe and then segued to us for the drum solo bump, only showing me walking behind the section holding my arm. The actual part where the axe hit me was not televised. Poor decision, obvious negligence, should not have happened, could have been avoided.

What had happened was a friend of mine who is a producer made a song for my channel. He is really big on making sure his music is available on YouTube to listen to for free. He wanted his music on Spotify too and to do so he had to be on a label, so he got a friend to put him on his label. There was then a mistake in some paperwork and the label thought he only wanted his content on Spotify, so they sent out auto-claims to anyone who had used his music on YouTube, including HIS own channel. That took about 2 weeks to fix, I lost out on maybe like 15 bucks because it was an old video, but if it was a new upload I coulda lost upwards of 500 bucks - the label did pay back to me what they wrongfully earned during that time though."

He said he was mostly struck by the broad side of the ax."

If two objects weigh the same, it DOES NOT mean they will fall at the same speed because it depends on gravitational acceleration and mass. Two objects can have different mass and accelerations that equal the same weight but fall at different speeds because they have different accelerations.   Edited to be a bit more clear"

Some people consider it hard work or believe there is some level of skill involved in finding and submitting this content, and that's where the 'cheating' part comes in.  Example: Posting videos of Will.i.am is considered cheating since it takes no effort. You don't have to look for or recognize the cringe in those videos because it's assumed to be automatic. As such you don't even have to watch the video before submitting, because you already know that they are inherently cringe-inducing.   Hope this clears it up for you."

One, you're not playing on a large expensive sound system where a small change can make a huge difference. Two, changing the eq on every song would be fucking stupid while driving but I'm sure it would sound better.   Third and most importantly, when you're djing and have two songs playing at the same time, leaving the bass up on both songs would sound like complete shit.

It's an hour and a half of drunken chavs nodding their heads and waving their arms while standing around a DJ. You could watch a film in that time. With a plot, something happening and perhaps even a fucking point!  I know that tastes can vary, but how can anyone sit through an hour and a half of this? ""Don't turn it off yet, that bloke may wave about a bit in a minute. Ooh, look, that one's walking off to have a piss, Thank god I'm not wasting my time watching Game of Thrones!"""

There are skills involved in producing the music and it's certainly no worse than vast swathes of other stuff that's out there. But are these vids the best format for getting the most out of this stuff soundwise?   I suppose there are times I can't be arsed to dig out something to listen to and I'll just fire up Youtube, so maybe you have a point.   I may just be old."

So what was your question again? Do I understand that ""good music"" is a totally subjective idea? Well, you tell me. I think I'd been pretty clear on the subject.

Saying things like  ""... but I can see it has merit"" is another way of saying, ""my music is much better, and anyone can understand that.""

There is a slight chavvy vibe to some of the attendees, I exaggerated for effect. That you got so bent out of shape by that resulted in me replying in an offhanded manner with a lazy response.

Every Boiler Room set is a showcase of what the vanguard of electronic music artists across the world are exploring in their studios.

He's been doing a lot worse cringe worthy stuff and he even has been called out for it by Germany's most popular late-night host, which was the absoute pinnacle of cringe (I could link the video, but if you are German you already know it and if not, you most likely wouldn't understand it.)  btw, the host is Sarah Kuttner. She's the complete opposite of Pocher."
cringe,3ak4fx,ShawnGood,32,Sun Jun 21 04:55:15 2015 UTC,You should link to it. Some of us understand German without being German or keeping up with things happening in Germany.
cringe,3ak4fx,gdlavery,43,Sun Jun 21 09:31:42 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/FKY5iHAoG_8  1:08 is the moment Harald Schmidt (the late night host in question) snaps. Oliver Pocher used to be his sidekick for a while.
cringe,3ak4fx,ShawnGood,18,Sun Jun 21 10:05:02 2015 UTC,Could somebody explain what is being said here?  Pocher's face as he seems to be rebuked is priceless.
cringe,3ak4fx,pusspunter,56,Sun Jun 21 13:50:29 2015 UTC,"The woman in the beginning of the video is a rather polarizing German rapper and brought Pocher some of her ""pussy juice"" as a present in that little jar. He's clearly uncomfortable with the situation and is not sure how to respond.  After the cut you can see a Norwegian singer who just performed her song and instead of talking English to her Pocher is making jokes in German (imitating a judge from Germany's version of the ""x got talent""-format) and finally re-gifting that jar of pussy juice to her.  That's when Schmidt says:   (to Pocher) Well now... that's very uncharming of such a small, little wretch like you. First you stumble over your words when you're presented with pussy juice and now you are making fun of the international guest who doesn't understand a word of German. That's uncool.

Maybe it's my American way, but I almost think it's classier to drop a subtle crack in a way that you're letting the audience know you are thinking what they are at that moment, and make it sting a little.  I'm thinking, like ""I wonder what viewers voted for you to do late night..."" or something sharp like that. But then again, I recognize what I see as ""classy"" may not translate."

And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand."
cringe,3akgwa,namesflory,2,Mon Jun 22 19:55:31 2015 UTC,I think the beatitudes and the temptation in the desert are decent theological sources for self-sufficiency.  There is a basis for miracles but Jesus' good works and teachings far more emphasize service than a few miracles.
cringe,3akgwa,GameClubber,4,Mon Jun 22 20:06:40 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate? I am a Christian and I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say.
cringe,3akgwa,DiscCovered,18,Mon Jun 22 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of Christians you've encountered in your life but the ones I know basically fall into 2 types:   the Sunday church goer who does not participate in good works beyond giving a few cans to the food drive, these people are typically spiritually very lazy and are likely to say, ""God will provide for those who are faithful"" as if the faith alone is enough for God to make things right in their lives   From 2nd Thessalonians we read: ""For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.""  From which I can interpret that those who are lazy in providing for themselves both physically and spiritually are not worthy of reward.  From 1st Timothy we read:  ""But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.""  This is talking literally about feeding your community if you have enough.  EDIT: Also  James 2:14-26New King James Version (NKJV)  Faith Without Works Is Dead 14 What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? 17 Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.  18 But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your[a] works, and I will show you my faith by my[b] works. 19 You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! 20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?[c] 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 22 Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? 23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”[d] And he was called the friend of God. 24 You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.  CLOSE EDIT   The second variety of Christians I meet and admire are those who are ministering to the sick and poor and filling their lives with good works.   I do not mean independence from God but rather not lamenting our position and crying out to God to change our lives for us. This is faith healing to me.  The entire written life of Jesus Christ is a story of service. He drives out demons, he teaches and just generally does not rely on his father to simply do things for him. The Son of God could have come down to earth and partied but his destiny was to be the ultimate lamb and undergo a grueling death by crucifixion.  I mentioned elsewhere about the temptation in desert by the devil who quite plainly dares Jesus to call out to God for water etc but Jesus refuses because that is not what being Christian is about. Being a Christian is hard work if you're doing it the right way, at least the way I was taught.  BTW, the entire book of proverbs is like a guide on how to be self-reliant.  This is a tough conversation to have over typing but I hope that makes it a bit clearer."

cringe,3akgwa,TheReason857,3,Tue Jun 23 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"God prefers us to learn and grow rather then have God do everything so we learn self reliance.

Which goes completely against scripture."
cringe,3akgwa,James_The_Narrator,2,Mon Jun 22 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Do you have scripture to back up what you're saying? I'm just trying to understand what you mean. It is covered many times in the Bible that we cannot do anything on our own. It is through God that we are able to do anything. I wouldn't say self reliance is an important attribute Christians are supposed to have. Obviously being independent is good. Maybe we agree but your wording just through me off.   And to your second point that faith healers, who claim to perform miracles, go against scripture, I would say....yes I agree to an extent. I mean, Jesus' disciples performed miracles in the name of Jesus, when Jesus wasn't present. And even after Jesus physically left Earth, there were still miracles. Some would even argue that miracles still happen. We might agree on everything I just said. We can definitely agree faith healers are BS. I was just a tad confused by your wording."
cringe,3akgwa,DiscCovered,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"I'll explain it this way, as actually this is a HUGE divide in the Christian sects, even among evangelicals, is the whole ""Saved by Faith alone.""  Well, I am just explaining both sides, you can decided which one you espouse to.  But, it is clear that in the New Testament there are several places that we are saved by Faith alone, not of our own works, for as the scriptures say, ""Saved by Faith, not of works, lest any man should boast.""  But, then we seemingly have contradictory scriptures in several places as well.  Because, while we have this idea that confessing that Jesus is the Christ and believing in him is what saves us, there are other verses that say things like drunks and fornicators and so on cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.  Or, the more explicit James 2:14-26 where he goes on and on about ""Faith without works is dead.""  Really seems to contradict right?  So, his side of the isle in interpretation is along with James, that Faith without works is dead, whilst this lady's is the whole, ""Come to front and confess you believe in Jesus and let me lay my hands on you and you are saved!""  And then, that person goes around the rest of their life saying, ""I was saved on January 5th, 2012,"" or whatever, as an example.  He is basically saying it doesn't work like that.  So, how does one reconcile these ""seemingly"" contradictions in the scriptures?  Well, if you get the side of the lady, she will give you the apologist interpretation of James and say something along the lines of ""Oh James was a book written for people that are already believers and telling them that even though they are already saved, they should still try to lead better lives.""  Or, you have the guy's explanation where you reconcile the two in that the reason the scripture says faith is what saves you, not of works, is because at the end of the day, no matter how good of a person you tried to be, you will always be imperfect, and since you are not perfect, you cannot return to God, or get to heaven or whatever.  As such, no matter how good your ""works"" have been, you still could never be saved without Jesus. In other words, you are ""saved by Faith, not of works, lest any man should boast,"" just as the scripture says.  But, that doesn't necessary free guarantee your salvation.  So, work out what you believe from this, but I will give my opinion, that it does seem silly to me when I meet people and they tell me they are saved.  And ya, I get a lot of apologists who like to say stuff like, ""Oh, well they aren't TRUE believers, because if they were their faith would change their heart and they wouldn't make those mistakes anymore, or something, like pre-marital sex lol.  Eh, I just don't buy that personally.  Why?  Well, the most telling scripture is probably once again, in James Chapter 2, since he seems to specifically be addressing this exact issue, where people were believing that just by having Faith alone they were saved, and the James say, in verse 19, ""Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?""  I mean, he is like ""Great, you believe, awesome! But guess what, the devils also believe in Jesus, doesn't mean they are saved."" And then essentially says Faith alone is not enough.  But ya, this lady is one of those tent preachers that goes around healing and stuff.  This guy is NOT against miracles, and a disbeliever in them, he was just specifically approaching this tent ""prophetess"" lady and calling her out on the whole ""Believe me because of the miracles I perform"" bullshit."

It's not a business like faith healers.   I understand your cinicism, atheists / agnostics tend to get that way toward religion and I don't fault you for it - but just because you view the faith as a ""scam"" doesn't mean the money doesn't go to good works.

Very very few people in the world think religion adds nothing that humans would never do without it. There's been a multitude of writings and debates on this subject, so it would probably be more beneficial of you to do research other than just reading atheistic view points. Maybe watch a debate or something, read a Christian rebuttal, etc."

However, I also think the way it's handled in some (not all) churches is counter productive. For example, I feel that when tithing is done publicly (passing around a basket during service) it puts peer pressure on those who can't really afford it, and people that can afford to give a little, probably end up giving more than they're comfortable with.  In my opinion, it's much more agreeable when the donation can be placed in an envelope and slipped into a lock-box outside of the view of church patrons."

cringe,3akgwa,ghenshaw,8,Sun Jun 21 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"It's not lying. Lying would be holding out a pen and telling you its a pencil (I KNOW its a pen....but i'm telling you a lie)   Thats not the same as believing something with your entire being... and trying to bring others to your belief. That is faith, it's as real to them as the sky is blue.     Let me take it to a level you'll understand. Is a schizophrenic lying when he tells you the government is after him or that he is jesus?  No. He believes it. Its real to him. It's not a lie. Is it the truth? no. But still not a lie.  Does that mean I think religious people are the same as crazy people? no, because I'm not a militant athiest/agnostic.   But lets do a parallel, if someone not unlike yourself calls a religious person a liar for ""pretending to know something that you actually dont"" Then wouldnt that same person be lying by pretending to know that god doesnt exist - you have no way of knowing they are wrong. So by your own logic you'd be a liar too.    That being said, I think your logic is flawed and that neither of you are lying - whats real to you can't be a lie."

I think it is fair to say that this is part of most Christian doctrine. No matter what terrible thing a person does Jesus will forgive them and welcome them into the ""kingdom of heaven."" The only thing Jesus will not forgive is lack of belief. In that case you go to hell. This is a very sick way to think; millions of people think this way and teach their children these things."

These things we know because they are revealed to us in Christ Jesus."

Consider the fact that there is no mention of hell in the bible until Jesus describes it. In a sense, the Jesus character invented hell. Jesus tells us to love our enemies and turn the other cheek when we are attacked. His teachings foster a victim mentality. Also I find it disturbing that according to Christian theology, if someone does something wrong to me (kills my family, lets say) that person can be forgiven by Jesus. I have no say. He will then, when he dies, be mingling up in heaven with my family members that he killed. No wonder why Jesus said turn the other cheek and love your enemy. Terrible morals if you ask me."

Yet, there are so many manifestations of that truth within the human translation, it appears that ""the plan"" isnt very well thought out or is inherently unfair.   A true god should make it clear that this path is THE path and allow for humans to make that choice.

There are only a few of these rich televangelists (most of them in southern USA), while there are a hundre thousand of real pastors all over the world, who barely make a living (of course some of them are doing better, depending on their location), and do none of it as a business, but as a community service, helping people.

If you had a genuine reason for being late back to your spot then you'd appeal and it's all good. If you didn't then you've lost your money.   I'd totally get the issue if this was some sort of scheme where they were unclear about how long you were allowed or purposefully tried to delay you but it's not. They lay out their terms and then you choose whether to play the game or not.  I've got tickets before and It sucks but really I've only got a right to be angry at myself for playing the game and losing, not going to get angry at some small business owner trying to make a quick buck."

cringe,3aka2k,sleepy55,0,Sun Jun 21 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sure your appeal to a shady private parking company where they serve as judge, jury and executioner is going to go over very well.  I'm not saying they shouldn't have some method to punish people who don't follow the rules, but $100 is absolutely ridiculous and is meant to generate revenue.  Fines shouldn't be your business, I don't know how you think that's a smart business decision."
cringe,3aka2k,sleepy55,3,Sun Jun 21 23:24:54 2015 UTC,"Oh it's not a smart business decision at all, people get annoyed people go elsewhere etc. I'm just saying it doesn't really seem unjust or unfair to me. They kinda laid out their terms and they stuck to it. seems pretty fair to me. The terms are a little extravagant but in the UK £100 isn't actually any more extravagant than any other place would fine you.   As for the appeals 99% of the time they're just going to give it to you if you're polite and civil and show up on time, any time spent with you is money pretty much wasted and they seriously don't want you to take it further into a small claims court. They'd rather keep things moving quickly so they can churn through as many of these fines as possible."
cringe,3aka2k,ShiaTheBeouf,0,Sun Jun 21 23:36:07 2015 UTC,"They didn't lay out their terms at all. They didn't specify how much the fines are or indicate that they have a full time attendant who strictly enforces the lot.  It catches people off guard because you assume in a tiny parking lot for a low key tourist area you would be able to walk inside the restaurant (the actual business) for a minute without worrying about rushing to your car to get a pass.   Despite any of that the most ridiculous thing is that the ticket is 27x the price of a full day pass (3 euros). How can you possible justify fining someone that much if it's so cheap to actually buy a pass? Obviously if the going rate for an all day pass is 3 euros then having someone park 15 minutes over their limit is not worthy of such a huge fine, even for deterrence.  The whole situation just reminds me of those corrupt small town governments who use traffic tickets from out of town motorists just getting off the highway as their primary source of revenue."

When I was working as a journalist I ended every interview with two questions 1. if they had any questions for me and 2. if there was anything I missed.  There were some interviews where the best stuff came up as a result of those questions.  It's awkward in a filmed interview though."

cringe,3ak7mp,MPair-E,14,Mon Jun 22 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"I've had way too much coffee today, and you bring up a good point.  The problem with j-school, though, is that it often reinforces this formulaic style of reporting but fails to teach journalists how to be 'human.' This leads to awkward situations and, at times, a sense of entitlement (not in this case) that can work against the reporter's own interests.  Students hear, ""End your interviews by asking if the source has anything to add, or has any questions"", and they do exactly that. What they don't mention is that the best way to yield information isn't necessarily to 'check off' these boxes as you do the interview for thoroughness sake. In other words, they often fail to mention that the question, 'anything to add?' stems from a place of empathy, not thoroughness.  It stems from a place of connecting with the source at a human level -- an acknowledgment that this person has placed trust in you, that this person is a human who has his or her own story to tell, and that it's your utmost priority to avoid, at all costs, misconstruing his or her source's sentiments. This sentiment should be clear to the source when wrapping up an interview. It should convey to the source, ""This is what I care about most. This is why I am a professional and why you can trust me.""  It's this kind of connection, this context, that yields interesting and important information, in my experience. It's how I'm able to get a restaurant owner on the record even though the video of him fighting with a customer -- that everyone in town is sharing -- makes him look like a maniac. It's why I'm able to get business owners on the record after they've been called out for signing a controversial petition. Believe it or not, the vast majority of people in a bad situation don't want to 'set the record straight' with the media so much as curl up in a ball/not have to worry about each and every word that's coming out of their mouth during a recorded interview.  What makes this worse is the fact that j-schools too often build in students a sense of entitlement (to information) that completely blinds any sense of empathy (which inhibits access to said information). ""Why wouldn't he want to talk?"" asks the inexperienced reporter after a snippy, dead-end conversation with a source. ""Everyone is calling him out right now on Twitter, you'd think...""  Unfortunately, rather than focusing on this kind of nuance, students typically taught, ""Make sure to ask if they have anything to add"" and they don't really think about it beyond that point. It becomes, 'oh, this is how I end my interviews.' They ask the question, the source often says 'nah,' they go about their business, and food gets left on the table."
cringe,3ak7mp,StupidDanishPeople,2,Sun Jun 21 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"All well put, thanks.  I was taught the formulaic way in j-school and--I think--their idea is that they give you the basics and you nuance them in the field and over time though I don't know how often that occurs. Interestingly I didn't work as a journalist long enough to nuance anything, but have honed and learned the humanizing piece that you talk about since beginning to become a Priest (which should happen in about a year).  Many of the things I have undergone in my seminary training strip away the formulaic stuff and encourage actual listening, listening to the person and what they are saying even if it is somewhat under the surface. As a requirement we have taken some very preliminary psycho-therapeutic training that basically just teaches us to focus and listen on a person and what they are saying and stay with them for it. This is what allows us to treat them as a human rather than a subject and minister properly to them. Journalism schools would do well to engage students in some sort of program or class that teaches listening of this sort, where you practice listening to the person rather than listening for soundbytes or keywords that will relate to your story.  I can't even imagine how many better stories I missed in my short time because I listened only for the keywords I wanted for my story and overlooked something much better than the human in front of me was trying to tell me."
cringe,3ak7mp,Fermats_Last_Account,-2,Sun Jun 21 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"Working as an ethnographer it is a MUST to ask if any subject have any questions for one as an interview or in the field - to secure a good interview, as ethical standpoint or to make sure positive contact is insured for future interview/fieldwork.  I can only imagine it's the same for many journalists, if they are going to meet with the same people again... But these guys were obviously not prepared to question her! I think it was even worse that she then continued to answer very quick and closed, not just killing the interview, but slowly torturing the good atmosphere to death..."

cringe,3akcv7,Tetraca,4,Sun Jun 21 06:08:01 2015 UTC,"He stopped filming in his house and has a studio. From a technical perspective he's got way better equipment than he used to have in terms of cameras, costumes, software, etc. Problem is he doesn't use any of that equipment amazingly well, so it ends up feeling a bit shoddier than when his show consisted of just cutting between movies and freaking out at a camera. If didn't try to use a lot of graphics/special effects it'd probably feel like there was improvement.  I will give him credit for the little claymation thing he did for halloween. That was pretty nice."

cringe,3agtnd,BertDeathStare,2,Sun Jun 21 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"No offense but that sounds like a really egocentric mindset, you say it as if people choose to be poor or homeless. Many homeless people for example were once hard workers with a job and a home, some also highly educated.  The lower class also works long hard hours, it's that they earn so little that they can barely afford their bills, and obviously that doesn't include huge medical bills, should they ever get into an accident.  Even for the homeless it's not that strange to have a job, though you'll understand it's not easy to find one when you don't have a home address or fresh clothes.   I guess that is a difference between me and my country versus some others. Most Americans are self sufficient and don't ask for help. I feel good about that.   In many developed countries everyone gets the same medical care, poor or rich, that's something the US should strive for, not this every man for himself stuff like you seem to be so proud of. Have some sympathy for baby Jesus' sake.  Put your pride and stubbornness aside and accept the fact that the US isn't the best at everything, and can learn from other countries, the same way many have learned from the US."
cringe,3agtnd,BertDeathStare,2,Sun Jun 21 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"So far your entire argument doesn't seem to be much more than ""lazy poor people should just get an education/job"".   As a point of reference, I've never said America is the best at everything. Clearly America has learned from other countries   Yet you call the US the birth lottery prize as if it's the best of the best. It might be the lottery prize from an underdeveloped countries' perspective, but it is most definitely not from a German, Dutch, Japanese, Australian, French, Norwegian, British, Danish, Austrian, Swiss, etc perspective, by a lot of measures.   Having said that I will say (in my opinion) there is really no reason that I can see that there are poor people here.   You don't understand why there are poor people..? Well, start reading, as you see people can't just decide to stop being poor, no matter how much willpower they have and how hard they work.  You might say some escape the cycle of poverty, well for every one person that makes it to the top (or the middle) there might be ten thousand that don't.   All you really need is the fortitude and drive to go get it.    Gee, go tell that to all the lower class workers who work long hours and still can't even afford proper healthcare, as if they're second place citizens, I'm sure once you tell them they'll reach to the sky and jump into the middle class. I hope you know how to make it sound like a joke, at least you'll get laughs then, not anger. But somehow I doubt you say these things in real life.   I do think some people would rather get handouts in place of work. That has been proven here and is really not deniable.   Well yeah, some people prefer handouts, and others want to work, what's your point? Should we not provide affordable healthcare to those who want to work, or already work, because of those ""some people"" who prefer handouts? Sounds reasonable. /s   It sounds egocentric to suggest I have no sympathy because I feel that people should work hard.   It sounds egocentric to say you are self-sufficient because you work hard, as if people who can barely pay their bills automatically don't or can't work hard. It sounds unsympathetic to not want to collectively be part of a society that provides equal medical care for all, rich or poor.   I give my time and resources to help those that need help but not the ones that are not willing to help themselves.   You are? Or you would? I'm suspecting it's the latter. How many people can you help? One? Two? Won't make a difference. There are millions of Americans living under the national poverty line, you can't help them get healthcare, it needs to be done as a nation.  Don't you think it's odd that the US stands out in this amongst virtually all first world countries? This is where the ""the US can learn from other countries"" part I mentioned earlier comes in. Per capita the US spends the most on healthcare by far, yet it has little to show for it, compared to the rest of the developed world.   If you want to get an education to get a better job, tell me how to help.   Well, for one you can support affordable healthcare, so they can go to a doctor or hospital when they want to without needing to worry about ridiculous sums of money to pay.   NOPE, I'll work to make sure it is and not accept defeat as fact.    You'll make sure it is? Good luck with that, you'll need it.

cringe,3agtnd,Princess_Merida,-2,Sun Jun 21 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're getting downvotes, but I thoroughly agree. My parents moved from a developing country to the US about 5 years before I was born and I grew up as a first generation American. I love this country and have SO many opportunities I wouldn't have had, if my parents chose not to move here.   Sure the US isn't the greatest at everything and the government is far from perfect, but I wouldn't have ever wanted to be born in any other country, nor would I permanently live in another country."

cringe,3adw3y,HAL9000000,15,Sat Jun 20 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"First off, the stage manager says the desk is worth several thousand dollars.  This means that it is definitely a very solid all wood desk.  Now, this doesn't mean that the desk is some kind of top flight model of unsurpassed craftsmanship or anything.  But that's not really the point.  The point is that really any desk constructed entirely of wood and made to look professional ought to be understood as having gone through a process of careful construction.  This by itself should merit basic respect for the desk or, at least, it merits not trashing the desk for a one-off sight gimmick.  Moreover, it's wasteful to treat a perfectly good desk as something that can be easily trashed and replaced.  So it's less about this being special craftsmanship and more about how any solid wood and professionally made desk has significant intrinsic value beyond what you would imagine if you haven't made stuff before."

Obviously it would be better if he hadn't destroyed the desk, that much is obvious. It would be better if nothing gets destroyed in most situations. But it's not like this is some sort of artistic, irreplaceable desk (irreplaceable for a house maybe, but definitely not a TV show). I think you might be imagining intrinsic value where there isn't any to most people because you're presumably some sort of carpenter."
cringe,3adw3y,mikenice1,6,Sat Jun 20 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"It's a TV show. If he had any ratings (which he didn't), MTV would've replaced it without issue in two seconds, WITH all of the aforementioned master Amish craftsmanship.   So maybe Tom knew because his show sucked this was the only desk he was going to get and was legit pissed.   But I don't buy that. As mentioned above, Tom Green made a living on creating awkward situations, he worshipped Andy Kaufman growing up, and he knows exactly what he's doing here: fucking with his guest."

When I was doing physical therapy the PT's made me do walk-cycles so that they could observe.  Apparently I stopped swinging my right arm when I walk and I have a very slight limp.  Every so often people notice the arm.  I just don't even think about it.
cringe,3ae1cw,WheresTheSauce,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:25:24 2015 UTC,"Arm swinging is just to counter balance the torsion your body experiences when walking (normally at least). So if you walk with a slight limp, your body may be compensating in some other way because the physics would've changed."
