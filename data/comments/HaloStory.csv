HaloStory,3e2n2d,apparatus12345,19,Tue Jul 21 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"This is probably something we need to put down to sloppy writing on the part of Bungie, but the simplest logical explanation for Truth's behaviour is:  1) He genuinely believed in the great journey  2) Even though he told Tartarus to activate Delta Halo, he travelled to the Ark because he thought Tartarus would probably fail, and probably used the halo as a distraction so he could get away from the Elites and the Flood (who were winning the battles of Delta Halo, and High Charity respectively.)  3) He was going crazy (thus explaining why the slick Machiavellian politician turned into a moronic religious zealot in Halo 3 - thanks Bungie), and believed that the worthy would ascend to the higher plane of existence, but that the unworthy would be killed.  Quotes like this support point 3:   ""Darkened skies and lashing fire are all that remains for them when we, the worthy, have passed to the beyond.""    Frankly it seems like the writers at Bungie were not paying attention to what they were writing. Cortana's inane babble, and lines like the following point to a general decline of writing quality:    ""Ma'am squad leaders are requesting a rally point, where should they go?""  ""To war""   I still love Halo 3, and i think the story is one of the best points in the saga, but it's obviously not perfect.  I get tired of fan theories about how the prophet knew the rings would destroy everything, because it really doesn't add up. We are told repeatedly that the Brutes are fanatically loyal to the covenant, and genuinely believe in the great journey and the promise of ascension. How exactly would they react after Truth fires the Halos and nothing happens? Probably not well.   Most of the main support for this theory comes from the conversation with Mendicant Bias in Contact Harvest, where the prophets learn everything they believe is a lie. This is usually misunderstood to mean that the prophets learn that the great journey itself is a lie, but i believe this to be a misinterpretation. Contact Harvest was written in the context of Bungie's vision of the universe, when humans were actually the forerunners. We are told that the Reclaimers are Forerunners that got left behind:   """"The Forerunners,"" the Minister whispered. ""Some were left behind.""   We are also told very specifically, that the covenant will collapse if the various races discover they might get left behind - NOT that the great journey itself is a lie:   ""He believed in the Forerunners' divination because in all their Ages of searching, the San'Shyuum had found no bones or other remains. He knew the Covenant's core promise that all would walk The Path and follow in the Forerunners' footsteps was critical to the union's stability.  And he was certain that if anyone learned they might be left behind, the Covenant was doomed.   These are the kinds of issues you have to accept when you get into the lore of a universe built by two separate corporations."

It's possible that Truth was simply insane. However, I think he still believed in the Great Journey in some capacity. Mendicant Bias' revelations only told them two things, that the Great Journey wasn't assured for everyone, as they'd assumed, since ""some of them were left behind. And that the Covenant (specifically the Prophets) weren't destined for the task.  Perhaps Truth dismissed much of what he learned from Guilty Spark. Regret's dialogue in Gravemind suggests the Hierarchs found Monitors to be contentious. Truth and Mercy may have dismissed Guilty Spark's comments on Halo's true nature as a test to be overcome. Or perhaps they knew the Monitors were useful, but not ""Oracles,"" as they'd thought.  Additionally, it seemed Regret believed in the Great Journey, as even in death he seemed devout. This could be manipulation by the Gravemind, but I doubt it, based on his other dialogue in this scene.  As for why Truth sent Tartarus to activate Halo, I have no idea. Perhaps he learned after the Battle of Installation 05 of the Ark's role in the Great Journey from the Recession at Voi. It's kind of a weak explanation, but it's the only thing I can think of that makes sense. After learning of it, he could reveal that being on the Ark during Halo's firing was necessary to undergo the Journey. His selfishness (and likely that of his forces) would ensure they'd sacrifice the rest of the Covenant for their own divinity.  I'm just spitballing here. There is no concrete answer, unfortunately."
HaloStory,3e2n2d,Defguru,12,Tue Jul 21 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like to think that both Regret and Mercy were devout believers, and Truth was up to a certain point. In Halo 3, the conflict between the truth and his life-long beliefs, along with his new found power, drove him insane, resulting in the inconsistent behavior in Halo 3. But that's all headcanon."

HaloStory,3e2n2d,Defguru,11,Tue Jul 21 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"Lol, yeah.  The voice change, I think, weighs on me more that Truth's inconsistent behavior. I love both voice actors, but each one's ""Truth"" is so vastly different! Terrance Stamp is a great actor, but he's be terribly cast as Truth in Halo 2. Conversely, given Truth's dialogue in Halo 3, I don't think Michael Wincott would have fit the role.  EDIT: Funny story, when I first saw the E3 2007 Halo 3 Trailer with Truth's speech, I thought it was a Brute speaking."
HaloStory,3e2n2d,Toa_Freak,12,Tue Jul 21 14:59:10 2015 UTC,Really? I thought the Halo 2 guy was perfect for truth.  He just kinda had that villanous voice. I don't really know how to say it but just the way he talked just screamed bad guy.

HaloStory,3e2n2d,DrummerBoy2999,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"Good theory. But the issue I've always had is that, sane or otherwise, Truth had no reason to believe that Tartarus would fail in his task to activate Installation 05. The MC was on High Charity and the Arbiter was believed dead. Regardless of his personal thoughts on the Brutes, Truth had put them in the position formerly held by the Elites, so he must have had at least some faith in their capability. After all, they did successfully usurp the Elites on High Charity.   My own personal theory is that Truth believed Tartarus would succeed, and that something would happen when the ring was fired. But Truth didn't get himself into the position of Hierarch by being a fool. This guy was cunning and shrewd. Truth was a believer in the Covenant faith, there is no doubt about that. But he wasn't devout to the point of blindness. Menedict Bias's warnings and Guilty Spark's babbling would surely have planted seeds of doubt in his mind as to the true nature of the holy rings.   So when Truth caught wind that a greater prize lay beyond the Voi portral, he couldn't ignore it even if there was a Halo ring right on his doorstep. Not only that, but activating the Halos from a protected location would allow Truth to learn once and for all of the true purpose of the holy rings. Truth wasn't devout enough to truly care about missing out on Great Journey as long as he remained in power. As seen in Halo 2, self preservation and the pursuit of power were all Truth cared about.  But what to do with Tartarus? Arguably more devout than Truth, and a potential threat to Truth's power now that the Elites were gone. Tartarus would never stand for Truth's doubts nor the blasphemy of hiding from the Great Journey. He had to be disposed of, just like the Arbiter. And what better way to do that than have him activate Installation 05. His success was virtually guaranteed. He would either ascend or die -either way he would be out of the picture.   Now, Halo 3 is where things get a bit complicated. Truth comes across as crazy and considerably more devout than he did in Halo 2. But why? We could take this at face value, but if we look at it from a political angle things are a bit more interesting. Truth is now the sole leader of the Covenant. Tartarus has disappeared. The other Hierarchs dead. The San 'Shyuum scattered after the fall of High Charity. The Council dead. The Elites in revolt. Truth needed to maintain control of his remaining forces, in particular the Brutes. And what was the one thing that had always united the Covenant? Faith. Play the charismatically devout prophet, on the verge of the Covenant's equivalent of the second coming of Christ, and you can control an army of believers and the fearful alike. An army Truth needed to find out the truth once and for all.  So yeah, in my head canon at least, that explains Truth's actions. I welcome critique though. I only put words to all this for the first time now."
HaloStory,3e2n2d,lord_addictus,5,Tue Jul 21 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"Johnson: ""What's the matter? Can't start your own party?""  Truth: ""I admit, I need your help. But that secret dies with all the rest.""  I think Truth knew what the Halos did wanted to end the war with the humans by killing everything in the galaxy and then going back and starting his own, new Covenant with everyone who took shelter on the Ark. He probably expected more Covenant forces to join him from High Charity before it was destroyed by the Flood, hence the quote you linked."
HaloStory,3e2n2d,LovisTheWise,4,Tue Jul 21 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's always confused me too. It's pretty obvious by the end of Halo 3 that Truth knows of Halo's purpose, so I've always been confused as to why he'd want to activate it.  Meh, aliens."

HaloStory,3e2n2d,FurDeg,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"My take on it, which somewhat mirrors what others have said already.   By the end of Contact Harvest, the new hierarches knew that Humanity were the ""Reclaimers"" and somehow related to the Forerunners, a race who the entire Covenant religion was based upon. That realization could have brought down everything, destroying centuries of work to build the Covenant into what they were. Their entire religion, generations of faith, was based on misconceptions and a misunderstanding of the past. At some point someone made a mistake translating something, and the Covenant was born. Even after 2553, when the Covenant was broken up, every single being of every single Covenant race had a crisis of faith, with the realization that everything they were taught, and their forefathers taught, was a lie.   Can you imagine the chaos?  The closest analogy today would be the groundbreaking discovery that the God that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam believe in was an alien being named Steve that came from Mars. Can you imagine how the world would be shaken, and all the wars that would come from it?"

HaloStory,3e2n2d,Dovahking94,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"It could indeed be sloppy writing, but I believe fairly firmly that the answer - at least at the beginning of the war - is no. Remember - Mendicant Bias's revelation only states that the symbol for ""reclaimer"" has been misinterpreted as ""reclamation"" or ""reclaim [this]"", and that the beings it labels ""are Forerunner"". He says nothing of the rings themselves or their purpose (his speech is actually rather brief), but the implication of extant Forerunners is threatening enough to the Covenant's foundations in and of itself that it warranted the genocidal coverup.  Their interpretation of MB's revelation was that, contrary to their prior belief, not all Forerunners had ""ascended"", and I assume they rationalized this as humanity being the unworthy or heretical remnants of the Forerunners who had been unable to make it to ""godhood""; I assume that they thought that word of there being extant Forerunners who had failed to make the Great Journey would introduce a crisis of faith among the Covenant member species. After all, previously they had thought that simply activating the Halos would guarantee them entry into the divine beyond, and to them this would no longer be the case.  So for the majority of the Human-Covenant War, the Hierarchs would have been operating under the assumptions that A) humans were unworthy Forerunners and would need to be purged, and/or B) the idea that the Great Journey wasn't as all-inclusive as they thought would create divisions within the Covenant. This may or may not have changed on finding Guilty Spark; recall in Halo 2 that they captured and interrogated him (after he had enlightened a rather lucid Sesa Rfumee) but they either lied to the Arbiter about what Spark said or simply failed to correctly interpret what he said. After this point, I'm less sure - Halo 3's characterization of Truth and exposition doesn't help, seeing as they kind of took a turn with his writing after the voice actor didn't come back. Maybe he was crazy, maybe he still clung to shreds of cognitive dissonance, maybe he felt that even though his life was a lie that fate was basically forcing his hand. I don't have a clue."

My first thought whenever I see one is never "" oh shit I'm going to need some heavy ordnance to take this thing down"" it's usually more along the lines of "" oh a wraith, let's see how fast I can melee it to death"".

It would be nice to see how society formed on Mars for example which is entirely red desert.  Obviously they would have terraformed Mars to be habitable for human life but it'd still 'look different'."

HaloStory,3e0gsl,E-Squid,12,Tue Jul 21 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea... and I can't see why it wouldn't be. Although, it would more likely be copyrighted by the manufacturer of the armor, so the UNSC would owns the rights to the original MJOLNIR armor design and some others. They would most definitely own the rights to the images of the Spartans themselves, so no ""Spartan-Strength"" anything unless the UNSC approved of it.  Interestingly, there is an action figure of a Spartan in-universe seen in Escalation #7(?)(can't find an image), but there's no mention of them being UNSC-approved or not."
HaloStory,3e0gsl,pr1va7e,8,Tue Jul 21 02:01:55 2015 UTC,"As far as the action figures are concerned, I could see them as a great way to covertly fund ONI.  Imagine ONI finds a toy manufacturing factory on an abandoned/glassed planet.  After Chief saves the Galaxy, toys/action figures would be in high demand for kids.  They could cheaply manufacture the toys, and sell them through shell companies.  Then the sales of those toys could be used to find any black op they wanted."

HaloStory,3e0gsl,Joesredditaccount1,4,Tue Jul 21 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   Considering much of the UNSC is derived from US military procedure and structure, we can assume the UEG's copyright laws do not protect intellectual property as it pertains to any civil or military works. However, this also applies to private entities which create technologies and such while under contract to a government agency. Therefore, neither the UNSC nor any MJOLNIR manufacturers (and there are quite a few, including Acheron Security and Beweglichkeitsrüstungsysteme) can claim intellectual ownership of MJOLNIR variants."
HaloStory,3e0gsl,In_Medias_Res,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:31 2015 UTC,"That's true, but companies can and do have copy rights to the likeness of weapons they design.

Similar things apply for real firearms in media too."
HaloStory,3e0gsl,Patius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"Gun manufacturers rarely trademark the likeness of a weapon, instead doing so for the name and, by extension, the brand. However, they also privately develop the weapons & technology to be sold to militaries, rather than being hired by militaries to develop technologies like so many private enterprises were to create the MJOLNIR variants."
HaloStory,3e0gsl,In_Medias_Res,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:57 2015 UTC,Hm. So would it be safe to presume that people could get away with branding products with knockoff Spartan imagery? Would the UNSC really have no recourse (or not attempt to set up some method of recourse) in the event of people using that image?
HaloStory,3e0gsl,In_Medias_Res,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"Again, this is based off of US copyright laws, but yes. MJOLNIR armour is not considered private intellectual property. SPARTANs probably couldn't be trademarked because, as an entity, they're public domain. Individual SPARTANs could be protected under privacy laws, but they're so classified it's unlikely anyone would know enough to commercialize on their identities in the first place."

HaloStory,3e0gsl,Toa_Freak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"You can't copyright something like Mjolnir. Copyright is generally reserved for copy and media. Mjolnir, if registered, would be protected by a patent.  To answer the question as to whether Mjolnir is protected, I would wager a yes. Undoubtedly, the UNSC would want to protect the technology, and the various private companies would surely patent some of the processes and unique technologies in the various variants of Mjolnir."

It is the role of a Reclaimer to activate Forerunner technology on installations such as the Ark or the Shield Worlds, and other undiscovered Forerunner constructs also requiring a Reclaimer to operate in some fashion lay scattered across the galaxy.[citation needed]  The exact qualifications of a Reclaimer are not entirely clear, but only a human or Forerunner can be a Reclaimer.[citation needed] Reclaimer has often been used by Forerunner AI and Huragok as a general term for humanity, although not all humans appear to qualify."

HaloStory,3dvxtb,Defguru,6,Mon Jul 20 02:29:54 2015 UTC,I still think the only reason they killed of Black Team was because they thought there was too many Spartan IIs that were officially active. Now it's only Blue Team and Naomi and she may not be officially active because she works with ONI.

Having more Spartans that are technically his equals makes it a little harder to buy into how special he is.

Also, considering HTT was an ARG campaign that was hosted on the same page that also hosted the two Trailers for Halo 5 featuring Chief and Locke, the canon status of it's visuals isn't as solid as it would be if it was a completely in-universe page. The appearance in these images also uses the old Halo 2 design that was altered in Halo 3. On another note, there have also been pre-halo 4 examples of his new armor's design such as this action figure that belongs to Gabriel Thorne but this time it's in Halo Escalation which is directly inside of the Halo Universe."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:02 2015 UTC,"HTT was not an Arg Campaign.  It is an essential part of the Halo canon which is also ongoing, it is not a mere marketing campaign.  Explain to me how Halo: Escalation is more ""inside"" the Halo universe than Halo 2: Anniversary, HTT and Spartan Strike, all of which depict unmodified Mark VI."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,CINCL,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"The series it self was in-universe. The Tumblr page where all the images come from is part of an ARG campaign.   Explain to me how Halo: Escalation is more ""inside"" the Halo universe than Halo 2: Anniversary, HTT and Spartan Strike, all of which depict unmodified Mark VI.    Halo 2 anniversary stuck to the Halo 2 design of Chief's armor because it was a faithful adaptation of the game. This is evident by the battle damage and armor details being the same as they were in Halo 2 but different than they were in Halo 3. HTT's Tumblr page re-used old assets and also contained information unrelated to HTT completely so while the audio itself is completely canon, the page itself is not. Spartan Strike takes place in a simulation so it cannot be counted over real in-universe examples."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,0,Mon Jul 20 03:40:31 2015 UTC,"The page is canon. It's coming straight from Benjamin. How would it not be cannon? It also didn't just re-use assets, it created assets. And referenced those assets in the video, further proving those posts are just as cannon as the audio logs."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,dshagi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"It's not completely canon because it also features some halo 5 trailers that have nothing to do with HTT, and the Mark VI design still uses the Halo 2 design and not the Halo 3 or Halo 4 multiplayer designs. The audio files are complete canon while the images are a bit iffy."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,0,Tue Jul 21 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'll settle with not completely canon in the sense of the trailers. However, everything else is canon. And someone from 343, can't remember who, made a comment that each iteration of design is canon, they are just different interpretations of it. So using the halo 2 over the 3 or 4 doesn't make it not canon but just uses an old interpretation. Also, why would it use 4? That version was modified by nanobots so doesn't make sense to have that version."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,dshagi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:31:44 2015 UTC,"The Halo 4 armor from multiplayer is what the default GEN1 Mark VI armor looks like canonically. The visuals on the tumblr page aren't completely canon by themselves like the Halo 2 cover art and the statue, but it is canon that there is a statue based on the picture taken by Benjamin during the battle of earth. Also, each iteration was canon at the time they were originally created, but within the current canon of the Halo Universe,Chief's new design is what he used during Halo 2 and Halo 3. The armor change in-between Halo 3 and 4 is the same as the change between Halo 2 to Halo 3; it's purely artistic with no explanation in-lore."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it differently; I think he was saying that nanomachines can do some pretty crazy stuff, so changing the Chief's armor is entirely within the realm of possibility. Of course, the Doylist explanation remains the same: new art team, new assets, etc."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,0mni42,5,Mon Jul 20 01:56:10 2015 UTC,The only thing he said about nanomachines in regard to Chief's armor is that they were used to repair some small dents and scratches. He didn't mention their relevance to the armor's appearance changing and earlier in the interview he said the change from Halo 3 and 4 was the same as the change of the Mark V from anniversary to the new animated FoR adaptation which he said was an artistic change.
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,2,Mon Jul 20 02:00:14 2015 UTC,"Right, but I think the implication was ""they can fix dents and scratches, so given enough time and effort, they can do something as drastic as redesign the suit too."""
HaloStory,3dvxtb,0mni42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:14:23 2015 UTC,He was saying that the nanomachines repaired dents and scratches in reference to people saying that nanomachines repairing his armor was unrealistic. He didn't mention anything beyond minor repairs and the implication you interpreted doesn't fit in the context of that quote at all.
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"But he also said that people shouldn't be so dismissive of the nanomachine explanation, and that nanomachines would be a lot more powerful in the future. Surely the implicit meaning there is that the nanomachine explanation is correct."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,0mni42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in the context he was referring to the armor repairs. Remember, 343 and Frank O' Connor weren't the ones that started the nanobot explanation. He said in an interview that the nanomachines were used for repairs, not upgrades, and simply supported what he said back then. He also says the armor's change between Halo 3 and Halo 4 is the same as the Mark V's redesign in the FoR animated series which is purely aesthetical."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"First: wait, 343i didn't come up with the nanomachines explanation? Then who did? Why were so many people annoyed by it if it wasn't canon?  Second: we've seen that the old-school Mark V does make an appearance in FoR as well (sorry, can't find the image anywhere else; one of those Spartans is clearly wearing Mark V)."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,0mni42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"First: wait, 343i didn't come up with the nanomachines explanation? Then who did? Why were so many people annoyed by it if it wasn't canon?   Because people spread it around the internet as if it was canon. I believed it myself up until a couple of months ago when I actually decided to do some research on the topic. Up until this interview 343 hasn't commented on the matter leading to speculation and theories to spread wildly.   Second: we've seen that the old-school Mark V does make an appearance in FoR as well (sorry, can't find the image anywhere else; one of those Spartans is clearly wearing Mark V).   That's actually Mark IV, not Mark V. Also, it's concept art and isn't representative of the final product."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,Ardusk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"So where did the idea come from, then? I could have sworn I read about it in a GameInformer article or something...   Argh, this is starting to mess with my head. I guess at the end of the day I just really dislike this idea that the previous retcons are being retconned and now he's suddenly been wearing the same suit for 40 years."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,0mni42,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"Seems like there is so many additional questions to ask Frank. Is 343 deliberately keeping so many unanswered questions or don't they have time to deal with them? Why in the comments is there alot of friggin questions that have yet to be addressed? Halo 5 will probably answer a lot but not everything. Are we just going to be hanging like this forever, 343 I think should sit down and just say they either can't talk about certain things and if they can answer more questions the community has."
HaloStory,3dvxtb,vincemisfit,3,Mon Jul 20 04:03:43 2015 UTC,Maybe it's the simple fact no matter what questions were asked and no matter how Frank answered the questions our community would never be fully satisfied with the answer.

HaloStory,3dwjv1,hypobonix,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:57 2015 UTC,That's crazy. The fact that another person came to the same conclusion adds a little more weight to this theory for me. I guess we have to wait until October to know for sure.  Also in the scene does it look like chief is sitting down to anyone else? Like something is in the way so its hard to see but he goes from lowering his weapon at the door to closer to the gravemind. To me at least it looks like he is relaxed which is a really strange thing to do in the presence of a gravemind.
HaloStory,3dwjv1,iReptarr,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:18 2015 UTC,All i can get from it was that scene in question was meant to be how Halo 3's retrieval of Cortana was meant to play out but they scrapped it and changed it up. Then the next scene in Halo Legends would be an event Cortana experiences between the end of Halo 3 and the beginning of Halo 4.

HaloStory,3dwjv1,anormalgeek,2,Mon Jul 20 08:28:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe the flood are the only way to access the domain. Maybe the domain itself is fine, but firing the halos killed the connection to it. However the flood is now sufficiently complex enough to fill in that void."

The great irony is that life itself is not peace, it is conflict incarnate. Conflict pushes you off center, thus the only way the achieve balance and peace with existence is to be in a state of conflict with yourself, hence:   ""The peaceful one is at war without and within."""

HaloStory,3dw2gj,Haruspis,3,Tue Jul 21 12:56:31 2015 UTC,"astounding, i just came to terms with this concept myself. after spending 25 years of my life trying to figure out ""who i was"" i realized that i am constantly learning and changing and growing and attempting to use the past to find out who i am presently is an unwinable uphill battle. so i let go a began to understand that giving myself an identity or settling on who i ""am"" would mean that i am done growing or changing and will remain static, so it is better to accept the inner conflict and the constant change of being consitantly inconsitant. and it did actually bring me a great ammount of peace."
HaloStory,3dw2gj,0mni42,6,Mon Jul 20 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it like this:   Imagine a top. It's designed to stand upright, but it can't do so without motion. Without a push, it can't do what it was designed to do. A motionless top is a useless top. In much the same way, a life without conflict is a life wasted; to be completely peaceful all the time would require one to be completely detached from reality. It might be a peaceful life, but not a useful one. Therefore, a constant state of motion (conflict) keeps one on one's feet.   At least, that's what I think he was getting at."
HaloStory,3dw2gj,BurningPlaydoh,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:40 2015 UTC,"I dont think there's any one explanation, but the meaning I took was a bit reversed from the others here.  To me it seems to be saying that to be peaceful, because change is constant, force must be exerted.  Like bracing yourself against a tree in a howling storm.    This seems to be what the Forerunners tried to accomplish on a societal level.  Massive powers used to control and maintain things the way they wished them to stay.    Installation 07 pushing against the planet and attempting not to be destroyed and the Didact's ship trying to reconstruct itself while being desintegrated by the Master Builder's forces seem to be allegories for the futility of this pattern of thought.  I always saw ""Daowa-Maadthu"" as both a complementary and contradictory statement to this.  Interesting that the Ur-Didact himself says that as well before entering his Cryptum."

HaloStory,3dvbx9,Defguru,6,Sun Jul 19 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"If your mom is into reading, and likes the sci-fi genre, I'd say pick her up a copy of Fall of Reach (or loan her yours if you already own it).    I grew up playing Halo and when my mom would stop and watch for a few minutes, I would give her some back story here and there.  She's never been interested in playing video games, but after my telling of the backstory and overarching plot, she was really interested in Halo.  I decided to get her FoR, and she loved every bit of it.  For Christmas last year I gifted her all of the novels that were released at the time through iBooks.  Now she had finished reading Fall of Reach, The Flood, First Strike, Cole Protocol, Contact Harvest, Ghosts of Onyx, and is about halfway through Glasslands.  So I'd say start her with a brief recap of FoR and then let her ask you questions as you okay with her watching."
HaloStory,3dvbx9,Master_Chief_71,3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"First, good luck. No matter what you decide to do, spending time with her is going to be the best thing. Just give her the important points from Reach, and jump into Halo: CE. If she enjoys it, follow the games release and go from there. Again, good luck and remain positive around her, but just be there. That's most important."
HaloStory,3dvbx9,drewmike6,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:39 2015 UTC,I'd say a good bet would be to go through the campaigns and let her ask questions anytime something comes up that she wants to know more about. That way it lets her control the pace of how much she's learning. And have fun with it!

It's a shame we never saw the sabre again, though we got a trench run in Halo 4 which wasn't quite as open though.  So I'm assuming every trace of research on the Saber is just gone at this point? Since it never came back up again and Reach was glassed."
HaloStory,3dukij,YeoBean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:17 2015 UTC,I much preferred the sabre to the broadsword. It looked far less plastic.
HaloStory,3dukij,kosmologi,14,Mon Jul 20 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"The launch sequence is one of the coolest cutscenes in Halo Reach. It really underlines how ""low tech"" the UNSCs space tech is, at least at the prototype stage."

HaloStory,3dukij,kosmologi,10,Sun Jul 19 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"I think because at that point in time there weren't really any fighters of the Sabre's power, or really at all.   Though I guess you have a point. Why hide that? Not like the Covenant would steal that tech."

HaloStory,3dukij,atfsix,7,Sun Jul 19 19:29:36 2015 UTC,I thought that the space mission was under developed.   I wish there were just a few more things it could do to make it a bit more interesting especially since it's so easy to do even on Legendary.   Maybe flares to get rid of being tracked or the ability to target Anchor 9's defences on a specific target rather than them just firing everywhere.   Still fun though. If it were developed a bit more then it could have made an interesting PvP mode. Or it could have worked better as a Firefight map.
HaloStory,3dukij,TheBoberts,3,Sun Jul 19 17:12:06 2015 UTC,In the pre-Alpha level there were several Frigates and Corvettes and Six was piloting a Longsword.
HaloStory,3dukij,Metlman13,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:29 2015 UTC,If you have ever played the multiplayer mode on StarFox 64 I think that would serve as a cool PvP space fighting mode in reach like you are talking about. Just have up to four players locked in one area of space like in the mission tracking each other down and blowing up each other.
HaloStory,3dukij,atfsix,5,Sun Jul 19 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"The Sabre Sequence in Halo: Reach is the height of that game, both in terms of gameplay and the story. Piloting a starfighter in a large space battle is one of Halo's coolest sci-fi moments, and few other vehicle missions in the entire series make you feel as powerful as you do in the cockpit of a Sabre, destroying Covenant starfighters with hails of missile and autocannon fire.  The one thing that always gets me though is how primitive the Sabre seems to the other starships in the UNSC arsenal, even though the Sabres are said to be a top secret program, implying they are highly advanced. The shielding and auto-repair system on the Sabre certaintly seem advanced, but everything else just feels a bit off. Maybe the Sabre was designed as a cheaper alternative to the massive MAC platforms the UNSC employed over strategic planets, as the Sabre was much more capable and could serve as a very effective point-defense fighter. The Sabre might have been kept top secret to prevent the Covenant from learning of it so they would be surprised by the appearance of the Sabre, which, given their only deployment in the Battle of Reach, was successful.  Honestly though, the space sequence just felt too short and unvaried. It would have been interesting if Anchor 9 came under attack from large Covenant vessels, and with UNSC ships coming in for support, you're thrust into a huge battle with projectiles flying everywhere and massive ships exploding and exchanging salvos. Would be like a dream come true for a Halo fan to witness a vast in-game space engagement."
HaloStory,3dukij,atfsix,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:26 2015 UTC,Sadly they couldn't nearly do anything like that with the limitations of the Xbox 360. Global Battle and the original Tip Of The Spear battle seen in the cutscene had to be cut as well.  The original Sabre mission looked much larger and had multiple large human and Covenant vessels crossing against one another instead of just two vessels orbitting each other in the final level.
HaloStory,3dukij,In_Medias_Res,3,Mon Jul 20 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'll just say that the Sabre looks and feels much cooler than the Broadsword, it was more fun to fly and looked significantly more unique and Halo-ey than the Broadsword does.

I don't think well be seeing it as a playable vehicle but cutscenes possibly. The time span from Halo 5 and reach isn't much but long enough for other fighters to develop. Especially since that ship is a prototype it's fairly safe to say not many more if at all were built other then that one.

I won't be at all surprised to see him side with Master Chief, regardless of his orders"
HaloStory,3dr4s1,xfortune,26,Sat Jul 18 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"The reason the fans didn't hate Halsey back then was because, as Nylund's books said, those things were in the past. Halsey did those terrible things, but it was during a turbulent time, and she clearly felt great guilt over it. She even attempted to atone for it, though often went about it in the wrong ways. It didn't make what she did not horrible, but it wasn't like she did it and let it go.  The same thing went for ONI. As far as Bungie's lore detailed, we had no reason to think that the ONI in 2552 was the same ONI from 2517.  ONI's current...character, for lack of a better word, has only really come about because of 343's expansion of what the organization is. And from a storytelling perspective, it's great. ONI dances the line of ally and antagonist in the stories we've gotten.  The same goes for Halsey. Where Bungie had left her off, she was certainly a criminal. 343 focusing on her past sins and making her ONI's scapegoat for the Spartan-II Program is a good idea from a storytelling perspective. Everything they've done with her is, at its core, a brilliant idea.  The problem arises from its execution. Particularly in the Kilo-Five Trilogy. The books changed established facts to make Halsey seem worse than she was, and focused on Halsey hate to such a degree that it was absurd. Some hate is understandable, and a good idea for the story. But Traviss drove it home with a sledgehammer.  Another problem is Halsey's personality. I've said it multiple times on this subreddit, but her character is the one big mistake 343 have made with the lore. Her character with 343 is completely different from how she was in Nylund's books. Some people say this is the result of her captivity by ONI, but her personality was completely different in Glasslands as well.  Still, I'm hopeful for the future of her character. Halo: Escalation issue 16, with Palmer talking with Halsey, seemed like 343 saying ""we've heard the criticism."" If they'll do anything with it is anyone's guess, but I'm still happy they're aware of it.  TL;DR: All this stuff with her character is a good idea, but the execution has been off in certain aspects."

HaloStory,3dr4s1,Defguru,7,Sun Jul 19 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"I think her portrayal in Spartan Ops was spot-on though. An arrogant bitch who is pissed at being imprisoned. Someone who doesn't want to help that ship's crew but her curiosity gets the better of her, which is fueled by her desire to have Humanity possess the tools it needs to survive. Even her talking to Jul was in character, since she's going to do whatever it takes to discover shit. And then her manipulation of Jul was great. But the icing on the cake was her reaction to discovering MCPO John-117 was still alive, her revulsion to being lied to and her slapping of Lasky to vent those emotions. Really, Halsey, Lasky, Roland and Thorne made Spartan Ops enjoyable."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,Dekar2401,5,Sat Jul 18 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"And I'd be fine with that if Spartan Ops weren't riding off the coattails of Glasslands. Her being pissed at being imprisoned would make any personality changes make sense. I'm also talking about her appearance in Halo 4's prologue. Her decree that the Spartans are humanity's ""destiny"" doesn't really gel with what her view of the Program was in Nylund's books. She was proud of her Spartans, and their existence was, in her opinion, necessary, but I don't believe she'd praise it that unequivocally.  Basically, if Spartan Ops had been the first we'd seen of Halsey since Ghosts of Onyx, it would be largely fine. But riding off of Glasslands and Halo 4, it just seems like the continuation of changing her character."

HaloStory,3dr4s1,BraveExpress2,7,Sat Jul 18 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really happy with how they've executed her character traits. In Nylund's books, we see Halsey through the eyes of her Spartans, basically her children. With 343, we're seeing her through the eyes of Kilo-Five (who only know her as a kidnapper and someone forcing children into service), and characters like Palmer (who exist to ultimately replace her ""children""). Seeing it this way, it makes perfect sense that Halsey is more hostile now than she was in the Bungie era."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,nebblord,9,Sat Jul 18 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"We didn't just see Halsey through her Spartans' eyes, though. Nylund's books gave us thorough examinations of who she was and how she perceived things. Her POV sections in Glasslands are too different from her Nylund depiction, in my opinion.  And I'm fine with people hating her. As a person, I kind of hate her, too (as a character, I love her). The problem is everyone in Kilo-Five harbors this deep, unrelenting hatred of her that doesn't make sense. Throughout the Kilo-Five Trilogy, the characters rag on Halsey in moments where she is in no way relevant to the situation. It's too thick. Same with Palmer. She doesn't like Halsey. That's fine. But the way she acts concerning Halsey (particularly in Escalation) is obsessive and personal, in a way that doesn't make sense.  Like I said in my original post, the idea of Halsey being a pariah is great. It's the execution that I believe is flawed."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,Defguru,10,Sat Jul 18 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"When Halsey got punched in the face by Lucy topped it all off. Don't forget the fact that a Spartan would never to that or that it would have killed her instantly. Now that was too much, and unrealistic as well."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,csbob2010,8,Sat Jul 18 21:08:53 2015 UTC,"The traditional Spartan iron discipline was one of the biggest casualties in Kilo-5. Lucy striking Halsey was incredibly out of place.  Just compare Holly-G003 in Ghosts of Onyx, who throws up in her helmet and doesn't take it off on the off chance they encounter more sentinels or troops, and Fred-104 in Glasslands taking his helmet off in front of an unknown forerunner drone.  Admittedly, the drone wasn't hurting Halsey or Mendez, but it still felt so out of character."

HaloStory,3dr4s1,Steely_Tulip,8,Sun Jul 19 07:11:58 2015 UTC,"I think that thinking of it in terms of modern humanity makes the argument easier to understand.

The 200 kids totally kick the aliens' asses, but not good enough so they take 1000 orphans and make them into second rate supersoldiers. It's pretty bad, but it turned out to ok."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,InquisitiveInheritor,9,Sat Jul 18 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"Halsey isn't the definition of evil, but she certainly isn't a saint either.

In this case, kidnapping children, indoctrinating them, and sending soon to die clones to their homes in their place."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,bobeo,4,Sat Jul 18 17:55:21 2015 UTC,I totally agree. One of the things that's so great about Halo is that there just isn't a black and white morality - every character is some shade of grey. Except the Huragok those guys are just always awesome
HaloStory,3dr4s1,Steely_Tulip,20,Sat Jul 18 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"Its pretty stupid of 343 to go that way, if that is in fact what they want to do. It's made pretty clear from the beginning of Fall of Reach that Halsey is just as appalled by what's happening as everyone else.   ""Although i am loath to bring this to your attention, I must. If the Office of Naval Intelligence detects a delay in their prize project, you will likely be replaced by someone who harbors... fewer doubts. And regrettably for the children, most likely someone less qualified""  Deja speaking to Halsey   Halsey's opinion is very clear:   ""I hate this... And sometimes, Deja, I hate you, too.""    I always saw Halsey and Kurt's role as the same - doing their best to limit the damage being done to the kids, whilst molding them into something great.  There is actually only one character who is really responsible for all the shitty things done to everyone by ONI, and that is Margaret Parangosky (head of ONI from before the spartan 2 program to the end of the war). It really pisses me off that Traviss turned her into her own personal Mary Sue while tearing down Halsey."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,Steely_Tulip,5,Sat Jul 18 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"Imagine that you as a military official wake up one morning, and you receive classified information that the Spartan Program was actually abducted children from (mostly) the outer colonies.   As a proud member of Humanity, you're furious. Yes the Spartans were instrumental in the war against the covenant, but children? The one beacon of innocence, and one woman brought them down to an adult's level, indoctrinating them and turning them into near machines?   What do you do? You can't say that the UNSC did it, Insurgents are coming back in full force, and something like that would tear the colonies to pieces looking for blood.   No, no, that won't work. You need something else.   A scapegoat.   And think about it, Humanity has always listened to those with clear intentions at first, those saying that the bad things are necessary for survival, and they turn against humanity in the end.   Dr. Halsey is that scapegoat. She created the Spartans, she has visible ties and records, its the most logical thing to do.   Why hate a government, when you can hate one woman? It makes sense, it puts a face on a monster rather than an entity.   The Halsey hate is part scapegoat on the military level, and this weird understandable kidnapping, lack of information level on the other side, with those who don't know the government had a say in the spartan creation.   I think what they're doing with Halsey is genius, it just isn't well explained through different viewpoints. If Travis would've had another viewpoint on Halsey, I think the hate would've been well received.   Great concept, terrible follow through all around."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,ghostrider385,4,Sat Jul 18 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Up through Ghosts of Onyx, I feel like she was built up to be this incredibly complex and conflicted character. She new what she had to do, why she had to do it, but still had to rationalize to herself that all the pain an suffering she would be causing to a select few would be far out-weighed by the good they would do for the rest of humanity, event though she regretted causing the suffering. Travis basically whitewashing her complex nature and turning her into ONI's scapegoat and the lightning rod for the hate for what ONI sanctioned in really annoying."
HaloStory,3dr4s1,sweaty_obesity,3,Sat Jul 18 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"While I can understand this view, a point that is often overlooked is that the Kilo-Five books are told through the point of view of characters who haven't been around Halsey for years.

HaloStory,3dr4s1,nebblord,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is, most of these characters come across the Spartan-IIIs, and have access to records on the Spartan programs, (Osman, Val, Maz, BB etc) They either know that ONI was more involved in kidnapping and indoctrinating kids and choose to ignore it or they are too stupid to realize it.

If cloning is illegal at this time period, and no-one has ever done it before, it would be every bit as big a project all by itself as the spartan program - and they leave the decision for that down to a mid-level scientist they don't even trust that much? The most powerful person in military intelligence, who knows basically everything that is going on, has no idea?  So many people insist that Kilo 5 should not be canon, because you have to accept plot points that make no sense in the established universe. A spartan 3 punching a 60 year old woman? The most important Sangheili characters in the series getting barely a mention throughout a Sangheili civil war?  But you're right, now we have to accept that Halsey is evil, because... we've been told to"
HaloStory,3dr4s1,Steely_Tulip,7,Sun Jul 19 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"And yet, in my opinion, we fans didn't care about her in the beginning with Bungie. Even with the books describing the kidnapping, the clones meant to die, the torture and modifications upon the Spartan kids, we didn't bat an eye.   See, this is what I don't get. Why is it now that people are catching on to the gross unethicality of the Spartan program? Like, was it not obvious before, or did people just not give a shit until the comics or books or whatever went ""FEEL BAD NOW""?   I mean, hell, that doesn't stop me from liking Halsey at all, and never did, but all this stuff like the UNSC being nigh-fascist and the Spartan program being unethical and ONI being fuckhead spooks, all this kind of stuff, it was all there either right out in the open or implied but nobody took issue with it at all. All the controversy and division I see now, where was that 5, 6 years ago or more?"
HaloStory,3dr4s1,E-Squid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"Are you bothered by the Spartans from Sparta, who raised children as warriors from birth (not age 6) and if they died in their training it was because they weren't good enough and everybody agreed?  Are you bothered by the Egyptians for hunting down and killing all Israelite babies so they wouldn't have enough numbers to rise up against them?  Are you bothered by the fact that today, millions of humans are slaves who are treated far worse than any fictitious Spartan and their families?  Whether we like it or not, the vast majority of humanity couldn't care less about these past and present atrocities, as evidenced by our actions. There are very few who actually care enough to do something, and fewer still who care enough to do something effective.  So while maybe some people would be furious after learning the spartans were abducted, I think the general sentiment would be, ""glad that was us and not them."" I personally, as an American, am glad that we used the atomic bomb instead of an Axis nation using one on us.  The point I'm trying to make is, unless we are directly, or indirectly related to somebody effected by an atrocity, we likely will just say ""that sucks"" and shrug it off.  It is because of past events in the real world that we know how effective raising children as warriors truly is, and because they are on ""our side"" we accept it and move on. I put ""our side"" in quotes because that is how the halo universe stared out. Like when you are born you inherit your parents ideals because that's all you've ever known, so to is the situation with the spartans and us. we never had any reason to doubt, the other side of the story was never made present in any form of logical way. Kilo 5 comes out and suddenly we have a different perspective, and those of us who are loyal to how we were ""raised"" are outraged at the ideas presented in the trilogy, and those of us who never made that connection with all former halo cannon, see the logic and justification behind the events of the trilogy.   Personally, if it weren't for the horrible inconsistencies of the spartans in Kilo 5, maybe the hatred toward Halsey would be more believable, rather than just taken as some idiot writer who didn't have a clue what she was talking about."

Vulnerable to headshots, but if you aren't accurate or make a mistake, you run the risk of them going insane and smashing your face into a pulp.  It was great.  Halo 3 and ODST Brutes, unfortunately, suck.  They're worse Elites with just a little bit of Halo 2 Brute thrown in in the form of their berserk.  They were a much less exciting foe, IMO, and the Halo 3 campaign has suffered for it in my mind.  Lorewise, their friction with the Elites was a lot of fun to read about, especially in Contact Harvest."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,Solias,9,Fri Jul 17 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what changed in 3 and ODST that you disliked?  I just remember them always, 100% being prefereable to Elites due to their (Brutes) shields not recharging.  Made legendary must more enjoyable."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,bobeo,13,Fri Jul 17 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"It just felt like a step backwards, first and foremost.  You had these cool additions to the Sandbox, but then you like tried to meld them and an existing one into a single entity to follow the plot you've constructed.  There wasn't much, if any, overlap between Brutes and Elites in 2, so it annoyed me that they forced it for 3.  It just seems like they wrote the story and then stopped and were like ""Hey wait, we just lost Elites as an enemy.""  And someone just shrugged and said ""Just make the Brutes almost like Elites.""  Like you said, there were some differences, mostly that their shields didn't recharge, but to me that made them inferior foes all around.  They kept damage so you weren't punished for being forced to pullback or change targets like you would be with the Elites.  Visually, I think they looked terrible in 3.  Their armor was gaudy and they seemed to cartoony.  The Spiker wasn't as cool as the Plasma Rifle, which didn't show up very often.  Brute Chieftains were never as tough as a high ranking Elite with an energy sword, outside of when they would just randomly go invincible and you'd just jog away from them.  All around, they just seemed less interesting.  I liked the plot that brought them to the forefront, but changing gameplay to make them into wanna-be Elites was a no-no to me.  Truth be told, Halo 3 is my least favorite campaign, easily.  And the Brutes and how they slaughtered Sergeant Johnson's character are big parts of it."

Just think how much more intense fighting red Elites on Halo 1 is compared to Brutes in Halo 3.

I know people thought they were spongey in 2 (not that bad if you have a headshot capable weapon) but 3 was the complete wrong way to go.

I feel like one of the big things missing from Halo 3 were the Elites themselves. They rarely appear as in-game allies, most of their usual weapons like the Plasma Rifle and Energy Sword are harder to find, and there never appears to be any great on-ground battles between the Brutes and the Elites like the last level of Halo 2.   One other thing I would have liked to have seen is a lot more fighting between the Covenant and the Flood. They show bits and pieces during Halo 2, but it would have been really cool to sit back on a ridge and watch some flood-controlled Prowlers assault a Covenant Wraith position. Although they were a huge pain in the ass, the idea of the Flood being able to commandeer vehicles was really neat and it was fun to battle UNSC equipment with Covenant vehicles for once (although the Scorpion was just murderous at higher difficulties)."

Marines with rockets on Heroic were fucking incredible in Halo 3, but give that same launcher to an elite and they barely even use it. You can't even trade them energy swords (aside from killing the Arbiter and leaving a sword next to his body), which was the coolest part about Halo 2, just giving some buddies swords and watching them tar heretics/flood to pieces."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,Cshock84,10,Tue Jul 21 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"The Brutes are, without a doubt, my favorite alien race in Halo. I can't exactly put my finger on why, but I find them so interesting. Their attitudes, social structure, and overall brutality are ensnaring to me. I'm especially interested in Jiralhanae history, and would love to see a book about them.   I think that, overall, this race has a lot to offer in the Halo universe. They are a very interesting race, and if done right, could offer a nice change of pace in gameplay. It would even be interesting to see them as a possible ally at some point. (If you've read Escalation, you know that this is plausible.)   I personally feel that Halo 4 suffered a bit because of the lack of Brutes. This goes for the Flood as well. Gameplay often felt repetitive, and Prometheans were more of a chore than entertaining to fight. I feel that if a Halo game incorporated the grotesque attributes of the Flood, the chore of Prometheans, the cunning of the Covenant races, and the savagery of the Brutes, it would be a beautiful and perfect clusterfuck.  All in all, I would like to see more of the Brutes. Preferably soon. This goes for the Flood and even the Yan'me as well. I just felt like Halo 4 suffered from a lack of variety, and gameplay was stale at times. This could be avoided by putting these old enemies back into the games."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,robcap,6,Fri Jul 17 18:47:40 2015 UTC,There's a great short story in Evolutions about some people who are captured by a pack of Brutes and get to play politics.
HaloStory,3dn5vd,Cshock84,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:50 2015 UTC,That's part of the reason why I love Brutes lol.
HaloStory,3dn5vd,Dekar2401,5,Fri Jul 17 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"When Spartan Ops started having Prometheans leading the Covenant, it got so much better. The Knights and Elites would hang back, then the Grunts would move forward while the Watchers would shield their advance with the Jackals holding the flanks. Then the Crawlers would try to sweep around. Then when you were sufficiently distracted, the Elites would bumrush you while the Knights would use their Pulse Grenades to keep you from retreating effectively. If Halo 4's main campaign had of utilized this effectively, it would have been so much cooler."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,Cshock84,2,Sat Jul 18 05:10:25 2015 UTC,Exactly.
HaloStory,3dn5vd,TheTimWelsh,6,Sat Jul 18 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"I don't want to see flood ever again, just from a story standpoint. But I think every Covenant race deserves at least a small appearance. Can you imagine having to defend the Yan'me homeworld with hundreds of buggers flying around helping out. Could be an epic battle."
HaloStory,3dn5vd,wildedge,5,Fri Jul 17 19:49:11 2015 UTC,I would love it if another Halo Wars happens between the EX-covenant species. Think how awesome an brute commander campaign would be with your choice upgrading for maximum gorilla warfare tactics.

If anything, they can possibly return in 6 or any other spin off game.   As a race, they're the opposite of elites and I liked that. Something about their dumb brutal ways of waging wars made them interesting. If they do return I want them to be just as badass looking in 3 but just as tough in 2."
HaloStory,3dm6tm,YeoBean,27,Fri Jul 17 11:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yup. 343GS even mentions ""a tactical pulse"" in Halo 3, when talking about Installation 04B."

HaloStory,3dm6tm,Defguru,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose it would have to be a small pulse if the Chief got left behind, but survived the blast.   Two questions: do the rings wipe out all life, or only sentient life (which makes more sense, given the 100,000 years since humanity was reduced to the stone age, rather than the millions and millions of years it would take for all life to return), and if so, are the blind-wolves sentient enough to serve as flood hosts?"
HaloStory,3dm6tm,B1GTOBACC0,5,Fri Jul 17 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"Chief wasn't left behind, he was just popped out long before he got back to earth. Think about it like you're driving down a highway, and suddenly the highway disappears. You don't end up back where you started, or where you were going. You're just where you are, but not on the highway anymore.   And the Halos wipe out any life with sufficient biomass and complexity to support a nervous system. Essentially, anything with neural pathways similar to that of most Earth reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals."
HaloStory,3dm6tm,Fenris447,3,Fri Jul 17 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"The Halos emit a pulse of energy which destroys the nervous system of anything that has a nervous system, including all sentient life and any Flood form more complex than a supercell. Were Installation 04B fired before the UNSC and Swords of Sanghelios could retreat, it would have killed the Gravemind and the combat forms, in addition to all Humans, Sangheili, and most life on the Ark and Installation 04B. Though the pure forms are made of entirely biomass, they require a direct connection to a Gravemind, attained only during the Coordinated stage. With the Gravemind killed, they would be rendered inert, as the Flood would revert to the Feral stage, leaving only the infection forms and supercells to repopulate. However, both necessitate the existence of a nervous system in their host, and so they would be useless as all of their potential hosts would be dead.

Did they plant the seeds for all life, exactly as it was before the rings fired, rather than starting from single celled organisms?

Almost anything with a nervous system like those of Earth vertebrates, yes. It's possible the pulse wouldn't affect certain types of life, as the Flood was unable to infect Lekgolo or Yanme'e due to their nervous systems being far different than our own.   Is there a way they reconcile this with what modern science has discovered?   Absolutely not.   Did they plant the seeds for all life, exactly as it was before the rings fired, rather than starting from single celled organisms?   Yes, the Forerunners took samples of complex life from all over the galaxy to be reseeded in an attempt to restore it to its pre-Flood state."

Pretty sure this also applies to the Ascetic, Ultra, Spec-Ops, Commando, and Outrider harnesses.  As for Forerunner clothing, the Covenant wasn't even aware of what they looked like.  Sources: The Cole Protocol and some Halopedia articles.  Edit: This may also be why ODSTs are referred to as ""Imps"" by Covenant members, not being as large or powerful as an actual ""demon""."

Here are some relevant quotes on the subject as well:   Despite everything, in my thoughts I could not help visualizing myself as taller, broader, stronger—like my father, with his long, pale face, crown hair and nape fur bleached white with lilac roots [...]      We paused. The Florian noticed my growing irritation. “Make hat,” he told Chakas, wiggling his fingers. “Forerunner has hair like glass. Sun burns his head.”      The Didact looked me over through his narrow gray eyes. The pale fur on his scalp bristled. “You’re enjoying being a victim,” he said.      Whereas my father was four meters tall, broad-shouldered and thick-legged, his skin like polished onyx, his well-trimmed patches of hair purplish white, his eyes black flecked with silver, my mother was just over two meters tall, slender as a reed, her hair deep red and skin silver-gray.      Faber stood within a confinement field, still as a statue, only his eyes moving as he surveyed the amphitheater, the members of the Council—and his judges. The sleek gray and blue head with its fringe of white hair seemed little changed.      A female, I was fairly sure, but not in her prime, with shrunken belly-teats and very different patterns of facial hair. Most distinct, a line of gray fur reached around from her cheeks to join beneath a flat, pushed-back nose. At least that was classically Forerunner.    The Librarian describing the Silentium Spoilers!       To be it seems like Forerunners have thin hair that is more cosmetic than functional. The males (Bornstellar, his father, and Faber) are all described as having patches of hair/fur which I personally imagine as very thin and probably smooth/soft.  Bornstellar's mother is described as having ""deep red"" hair, but it's other characteristics are not explained.  Hopefully this helps answer your questions. :)"

There was another thread around here somewhere that stated that the Domain has rules it follows - the Domain will not personally communicate with people, but it will use people that once existed to communicate with those that still exist.   Edit:  I can't find the post.    I FOUND IT https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/39yzkp/in_light_of_todays_trailer_here_is_my_crackpot/cs7viit"
HaloStory,3djnwd,BlindGuardian117,7,Thu Jul 16 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Seems like the Domain is either communicating with Chief in a way he understands and a way that motivates him.   Or, considering she says ""the domain is now open to me"" in the Game Informer article, maybe the Librarian shipped off a copy of her during the short conversation with her in Halo 4.  All this Domain stuff is really interesting to me considering the Forerunner didn't really understand it or know where it was. Yet know we have a Forerunner construct or promethean claiming to be the Keeper of the Domain. That, and the Primordial said it would be destroyed by Halo."
HaloStory,3djnwd,TheTimWelsh,5,Thu Jul 16 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Well we do have Forerunners called Haruspis that studied the Domain (and maybe even lived in it?).  Maybe it is possible that the Domain can use Forerunner tech, to a point.    My theory is - the Domain went into a emergency shutdown state after the Halo's were fired (and the Primordial was wrong or purposely lying to the Librarian).  Something, maybe a Precursor outside of the Galaxy, or something could have reactivated it/rebooted it.  (Maybe the Domain senses upcoming changed to the galaxy, like the Domain once sensed the end of the Forerunners existence, and reactivated to start recording the events of the galaxy again.)  Now it realizes that it needs something physical to protect it and all of the nodes the Forerunners left behind to access the Domain.  (Hey, the Flood had access to the Domain and possibly corrupted portions of the Domain.  Having something to protect the physical access points would make sense.  And the strongest technology is the Forerunner tech, especially since the Ur-Didact created the robotic technology based Promethians.)  Lots of editing for grammar and adding/changing stuff."
HaloStory,3djnwd,BlindGuardian117,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:24 2015 UTC,It made sense that the Flood could access it because the Flood are (or at least and evolution of) the Precursors.

Follow my logic here: Precursors created the Domain. Precursors become the Flood. We know the Graveminds have a form of galaxy wide telepathy, potentially actual access to the Domain. At the end of Halo 2, Cortana is trapped with Gravemind for weeks/months? In Halo 3, despite being separated by lightyears, Cortana is able to reach out specifically to John in the form of his visions. We know that Cortana has on a couple occasions, most notably the Unyielding Hierophant, used the tactic if copying herself to overwhelm enemy cyber defenses. If she used this tactic in her struggle against the Gravemind's influence, could a copy have slipped into the Domain/potentially saved the original during the fight with the Didact?  Or I could just be grasping at straws."
HaloStory,3djnwd,FullplateHero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"Could be.  With how the Domain is, it could also be possible Cortana could have been preserved in the Domain itself since it's collects and stores information.  I'm not saying she is alive or alive how we understand it, but she could live within the Domain by now being part of it.  There are any number of ways she could have joined with it, through the Flood/Forerunner Info/end of Halo 4.  The original Cortana is likely gone forever but her essence could be in the Domain somehow and we might see more of her in the coming games. For now it's fire team oriented which is awesome, but I don't doubt that we will see more of her in the future somehow, especially when the flood comes into play.  I feel like the Domain may not want to be part of a flood collective."

However, there isn't a specific mention of what type of engine the Pelicans use; or the Albatross, Condor, etc. Due to the UNSCs ability to create very compact fusion reactors (i.e. Mjollnir powerpacks) it could be that they fit smaller craft such as the Pelican with them. However, depending on power necessity and cost benefits, it could be that Pelicans are fitted with more conventional engines instead."

HaloStory,3diiwg,Raptorclaw621,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"Extending my thinking from the Pelican example, maybe the Longswords also artificially limit the fuel for the fusion reactor on board for some safety related reason.    Now that I'm thinking about it some more, it could be a practical limitation because of how sparse fusible gases are.  (I'm assuming that the fusion reactor runs on deuterium + helium 3).    For example, the Skylon design in real life has its range limited by the volume of the hydrogen tanks:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)#/media/File:Skylon_diagram.jpg  If it was stored more densely it would significantly extend the range of the design but that would trade safety and reliability for that range.  Reliability is a big deal in aerospace designs."
HaloStory,3diiwg,arghcisco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"Helium 3 is radioactive, but not so much so that a shot down Longsword would be catastrophic. It has a half life of about 12 years.  To add to that, it takes an absolutely tiny quantity of fuel to run a fusion reactor. To try and keep the discussion in-lore, I'd say that the amount of fuel wouldn't be a concern for any fusion-powered craft. That Skylon design is not fusion powered, it simply burns the fuel."
HaloStory,3diiwg,robcap,3,Fri Jul 17 00:10:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you're right, assuming it's helium 3 and hydrogen.  I have some other thoughts:   Maybe it's some exotic isotope (isomer?) that can only be manufactured in microgram quantities and has to be rationed to the point where a flight could run out of fuel? Maybe it's not fuel at all, maybe it's coolant which is required as part of the flight systems' operation.  Perhaps the reactor is a special compact design which requires active cooling in order to meet the specifications for a flying vehicle. Maybe it has a hybrid engine where the fusion reactor only helps heat the incoming air.  Both the Longsword and the Pelican are aerospace craft, and in lore there isn't any such thing as a reactionless drive.  Therefore, there has to be at least one propulsion mode where the operating principle is Newton's second law, and this requires shoving matter out the back (i.e. fuel)."

HaloStory,3diiwg,bill2401,2,Thu Jul 16 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"But a tiny amount.   In fact, a fusion reaction is about four million times more energetic than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal, oil or gas. While a 1,000 MW coal-fired power plant requires 2.7 million tons of coal per year, a fusion plant of the kind envisioned for the second half of this century will only require 250 kilos of fuel per year, half of it deuterium, half of it tritium.   https://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels"
HaloStory,3diiwg,robcap,3,Fri Jul 17 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"If I were to offer personal opinion, I agree. I think because they're a semi-short range support vehicle typically attached to a base or warship, it would be fine to use conventional propulsion."

HaloStory,3dgfwm,Shmallowman,37,Thu Jul 16 03:00:52 2015 UTC,"Kind of tough to explain. So when you go to slipspace and come back, there are lots of paradoxes and time stuff that will be messed up, but when you return there's thing called reconciliation which naturally eliminates all of those paradoxes and makes sure you don't atomize or something.   So basically there's a finite limit of reconciliation, but it naturally regenerates over time, IF there is less slipspace travel. So moving massive objects like Halos around will accumulate slipspace debt over time, as will smaller objects moving immense distances (like to another galaxy).  If you run out of debt, you will be unable to travel ... you'll drop out of slipspace more and more often as debt accumulates. The Flood knew how to manipulate this and would use it against the Forerunners, stranding them, while they're tech was advanced enough to ignore those effects. Towards the end of the Forerunner-Flood war, Forerunners had a lot of trouble moving around because 1) the Halo Array had to be deployed, which is very taxing on slipspace debt and 2) the Flood were messing with space itself.  Obviously it's a pretty hefty topic and it was really important in the last Forerunner book, so I thought it would build up to something. But maybe it was a concept just meant for the Forerunner trilogy. We haven't seen this in the games or anything in the modern era because all our ships and stations are waaaay smaller than a Halo, plus we're fighting in a smaller region of the galaxy (I think), than the Forerunner-Flood war, so travel is much less."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,atfsix,15,Thu Jul 16 04:37:43 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty interesting. The Flood manipulating it as a tactic is clever of the writers honestly.
HaloStory,3dgfwm,Rhydnara,3,Thu Jul 16 04:51:18 2015 UTC,So... Sort of like a more nuanced version of the Reapers disabling Mass Relays?
HaloStory,3dgfwm,ghostrider385,3,Thu Jul 16 08:01:10 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Slipspace debt has more to do with the actual fabric of the universe than physical constructs like the Mass Relays.  Think of the galaxy like Einstein envisioned it; gravity has the ability to warp spacetime like a rubber mat.  A lot of slipspace travel will mess up that rubber mat and you won't be able to travel so easily.  I may have just made it more complicated than I meant to...look up Einstein's relativity and the rubber mat analogy, it may help."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,DrummerBoy2999,6,Thu Jul 16 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"Think of slipspace like an egg. The more you use it, cracks start to appear. Slipspace seems to be on the level of gravity, and nature ""fixes the cracks"" by making ships pay for the time they spent in slipspace straining it.   Slipspace is like a highway. The more you put things on it and the heavier and larger things moving on it, the slower it goes and the more damaged it gets with so much on it. The universe has a way to fix the damage in order to prevent space and time falling apart.   Though I suspect, one could break slipspace entirely, if taxed hard enough."

Could you ELi5 this part for me, I don't quite understand it."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,DrummerBoy2999,13,Thu Jul 16 08:30:53 2015 UTC,"When something enters slipspace, it is entering another dimension in which all matter is stretched, due to the smaller size of the slipspace dimension relative to the universe itself. Basically, it's quicker to move this way because it means you cover the same amount of ground but when you escape slipspace you'll end up at a point further away than possible otherwise. To exit slipspace is to reenter the universe in the same state at which you started, but reconciliation fixes the size problem and other paradoxes."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,jammyasdfg,5,Thu Jul 16 09:40:52 2015 UTC,...my brain hurts. I think I need to do some research.
HaloStory,3dgfwm,DrummerBoy2999,9,Thu Jul 16 09:51:40 2015 UTC,If you play minecraft you might know that it is faster to move in the nether than in the overworld because for every 1 block of nether it is 8 of overworld. it is like that with the a distance in slipspace covering much further than the same distance in the real world.
HaloStory,3dgfwm,In_Medias_Res,6,Thu Jul 16 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"I understand slipspace well, just not the paradoxes and reconciliation and all that."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,DrummerBoy2999,5,Thu Jul 16 11:05:05 2015 UTC,"Well, think of it like this:  Like any construct, the universe has a set of internal logic on which it operates. Anything that violates these rules creates a paradox. Take a brick house for example. The entire structure is made of bricks, therefore all of the blocks making up the house are brick. This is internal logic. One day one of the bricks has turned to a block of gold. It wasn't replaced, it just changed. This is a paradox, because it violates the internal logic and yet there it is staring you in the face.  In the Halo canon, everything exists within a single, contained space called the universe, like a brick house. Within that universe there are different planes of existence, better known as dimensions and represented in this analogy by rooms in the brick house. What we think of as the physical world, from the vastness of space down to the tiniest subatomic particle, is contained within one of these rooms, and is represented in this analogy by a box. Within that subdivision which includes all of the tangible things that make up our plane of existence exists a UNSC warship, represented in this analogy by a pebble.  Now, continuing the analogy, there is a similar box in every room of the house. Some are nearly empty, some are nearly filled to the brink. In the analogy of slipspace travel, you open the box and find the pebble sitting there amongst some other clutter. You close the box, and then reopen it. Without explanation, the pebble is now on the other side of the box. Nothing moved it, nothing could have moved the box. This violates the Schrödinger equation and is therefore a paradox which violates the house's internal logic. Upon observation, it's discovered that somehow (this analogy isn't perfect) the pebble is transported to another box in another room (slipspace), which is different than its original box. The pebble rolls to where space is available and then returns to the other box in a different location than should be possible. The paradox is twofold: for the box, the pebble has transported itself without explanation; for the pebble, it has travelled further than it actually moved.  Here's where reconciliation kicks in. Even though the pebble has violated the logic of itself and its box, it has not violated the logic of the brick house (barring magical teleportation from box to box). The house therefore decides that the pebble must be scaled to reflect its current box as opposed to the circumstances in which it travelled, meaning that the speed that the pebble travelled in the other box is scaled down to whatever speed makes sense in its current box. Other paradoxes, like how despite relativity the pebble has not experienced time dilation, are also cancelled out.  In the Halo canon, it is believed that the universe itself is alive to an extent. In a more complex sense, the universe is like a living body and while paradoxes cause it damage, reconciliation is the process by which it heals."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,In_Medias_Res,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"So, slipspace travel causes debt, which 'hurts' the universe, and reconciliation gets rid of it?"
HaloStory,3dgfwm,jammyasdfg,3,Thu Jul 16 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"In an analogy, yes. In ""reality"", slipspace travel creates a paradox which the universe decides isn't really a paradox, and reconciliation is the process by which the universe fills in the gaps created by a paradox."

HaloStory,3dgfwm,ghostrider385,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:29 2015 UTC,yep. completely different from slipspace tech.
HaloStory,3dgfwm,incognitopuma,16,Fri Jul 17 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"Basically, slipspace debt is the Universe's natural way to stop paradoxes and space time freaking out using Slipspace.   Using it, even for small distances, accumulates ""debt"", time spent that the universe needs to fix.   Slipspace is sort of like a giant network on Comcast. You have a set bandwidth, and don't you dare cross it.   Moving massive objects through slipspace costs enormous time debt.   Lots of traffic slows down slipspace (the network) and so the universe claims the time debt and the universe begins to repair the holes in space time.   The Forerunners had an empire so large, that moving ships across the galaxy needed to be tended to carefully. All of their ships was putting a strain on slipspace, and journeys were becoming longer.   Citizens had to pay a time debt fee in order to use slipspace, and likely helped alleviate time debt.   Massive portals were also constructed to move citizens across the Empire faster than a drive would allow one to go, helping the time debt, but would largely hurt it more because of the amount of portals they had active, and how long they kept holes in spacetime open.   Long journeys also accumulate large amounts of debt. The longer the journey, the trip may take longer. Forerunner captains would take their ships out of slipspace and let the reconciliation process take effect before jumping again.   Towards the end of the Forerunner War, the Flood taxed the forerunners to using slipspace so much, that they broke the network. Slipspace was either way to slow to use, or it just would strand Forerunners somewhere they didn't want to be.   This was nature's way of protecting itself, and began slowly repairing the tear in Slipspace, to prevent space and time to screw itself open.   After the Halo Rings activated, Reconciliation had a very good chance to repair, with everyone dead. By the time civilizations gained the ability to go to the stars with a slipspace drive, Time Debt inflicted by the Forerunners probably had be all payed for.   This cleared the way for a new galaxy full of slipspace traffic, though its only a matter of time before its abused or broken again."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,PastelFlamingo150,5,Thu Jul 16 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"I really, really doubt so. It only became a thing in Ancient Halo due to the Forerunners moving not only stupidly massive fleets, but ~12 stupidly massive objects, alongside all civilian activity as well.   Current humanity, and all other ""modern"" civilizations in Halo do not hold even the smallest of candles to the amount of slip space usage the Forerunners were doing."
HaloStory,3dgfwm,Ragadash7,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:11 2015 UTC,I doubt it. It's too abstract a concept to do in a game. And the effects would only appear if the Didact were relocating the halo rings or shield worlds or going to the Magellanic Clouds.

HaloStory,3df81e,Jabberwaky,26,Wed Jul 15 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"Let me make sure I am understanding your question correctly.  You are asking if a Spartan could flip or stop a Warthog while it is driving, correct?  If so, it depends on a the circumstances.    The first would be the speed of the warthog.  If it is traveling under ~35 kph (~20mph), I imagine that a Spartan II or IV would be able to stop it, even if it is hitting him/her head on.  There wouldn't get away completely unscathed, but by Spartan standards (still operating with failing organs) they would be fine. However, once the warthog picked up speed, the momentum and force behind the impact would kill or maim even a fully-shielded Spartan-2.  The second circumstance would be the type of Spartan.  Fully armored and shielded Spartan II's and IV's could likely stop a warthog with the above mentioned specifics.  However, a Spartan-III wearing SPI armor has neither the shields, nor the augmented strength that a II/IV has.  While they are still 2-3 times stronger than an average human and nearly as badass, they still can't stop physics.  A warthog traveling anymore than 25kph (15mph) would likely kill/maim a Spartan-III.  As far as flipping the warthog, any Spartan should be able to do that.  It all boils down to timing.  As long as the Spartan's superhuman reflexes allow them to hit/push the warthog at the right spot, at the right time, all classes of Spartan would be able to flip the vehicle.

HaloStory,3df81e,altytwo_jennifer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:41:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that seems wrong lore wise. That definitely should've taken Halsey's head off. Was that Lucy?
HaloStory,3df81e,TheTimWelsh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"I think that it was Lucy.  IIRC, the puncher was mute.  I view it as an unreliable narrator, since earlier the III's were described as being as effective or more effective than Elites in melee."

HaloStory,3df81e,vincemisfit,7,Thu Jul 16 10:48:31 2015 UTC,"Stopping might be limited to speeds of like 15 mph, and even then if the warthog started gunning it, the Spartan would be screwed. here's an example of how important traction is. 2WD vs AWD. So if the Warthog decided to gun it with the Spartan at the front, unless the Spartan  picks up the front end or tosses it on its side I think the Spartan would get run over. But I think the Spartan is smart enough to know this and would flip it or jump up, land in the passenger seat and elbow the drivers head clean off, take over and have their own Warthog."

And at the end where the inconsistency between fall of reach and halo:reach is amended as well."
HaloStory,3dftjb,Grandmaofhurt,3,Wed Jul 15 23:07:05 2015 UTC,ya i had the same questions too. the book actually was written before Halo: Reach the game was made. At that time the only halo game was CE so people didn't really know the lore before that. its kind of like how some people wrote star wars books before the prequels were released that weren't even close to the way George Lucas had them be.
HaloStory,3dftjb,US_N1NJA_SLAYER,9,Wed Jul 15 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"Fun fact- Fall of Reaxh actually released before Halo: CE. Not by much, a few weeks I think, but still."

HaloStory,3dftjb,YeoBean,3,Thu Jul 16 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a bit muffled in history, but from what I remember, they'd done that with all their first party IPs from that era. Brute Force, Crimson Skies, and Gears of War all had novels either around release date or before. GoW and Halo are the only two that are still getting novel releases, and the other two just kinda faded into obscurity."
HaloStory,3dftjb,shaneathan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:16 2015 UTC,I think that they just wanted to give the game some backstory

Additionally, it contains an Adjunct section with several documents and stories to flesh out certain parts of the book and the rest of the universe."
HaloStory,3dftjb,Defguru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"The original is just that the original seed of the Halo universe.  The 2010 Edition tried to blend in Reach (the game) in order to have it make sense and they edited the part about the elites, as stated above. What was wrong with Edition (which I have. :-(   ) is that they introduced a slew of time errors and other things that were not in the original book. It seems like it was poorly edited.  Now the 2011 Edition. AKA the Definitive Edition went out and fully corrected all the issued introduced in the previous Edition. (The FALSE Definitive Edition that was PUBLISHED in 2010)   So just make sure it says yours was release in 2011 if it wasent clear on the book/website. Just FYI.  Thanks for reading."

They were a good concept when, lore-wise, they were hidden away deep in the bowels of the Covenant working on repairing ships or whatever. They don't have a good lore role post-Covenant, and I'd agree that they've been used a little irresponsibly in the advancement of the plot since the Covenant as a large, unified faction died."
HaloStory,3demaw,StraightRidahs,7,Thu Jul 16 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"It's pretty ridiculous the number of them that are wasted in ODST considering how rare and precious they are supposed to be. Hell there's, what, a couple dozen Huragok ""houses"" in one mission."

HaloStory,3df8hu,Mr_Admirals,20,Wed Jul 15 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"No, because the mechanics we're encountering while playing Halo are not equivalent to how things would behave in canon.   IE It takes 15(?) bullets to kill a Spartan with an AR in Halo CE, yet in the novel The Fall of Reach, it's mentioned that a single AR bullet only brings MJOLNIR Mk. V's shield bar down by a hair's width."
HaloStory,3df8hu,OwenLaughing,10,Wed Jul 15 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"There's even simpler stuff like the assault rifle can headshot enemies, grunts are killed in a few rounds, a single needler round can easily kill a marine"

HaloStory,3df8hu,CommanderMilez,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:46 2015 UTC,MK.VI tanked several fuel rods in the chest and didn't even sustain cosmetic damage. In no point in the lore are Spartans vulnerable to small arms fire while in MJOLNIR
HaloStory,3df8hu,KevinLee487,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:10:25 2015 UTC,MK.VI tanked several fuel rods in the chest   The chest is covered in pure Titanium-A.  Buck got shot in the back by an AR in New Blood while wearing Gen 2 armor.  Chief's suit was pierced by an Infection Form during the events of The Flood  One of the Spartans got hit by a single Fuel Rod wielded by a Hunter during the Battle of Cote De Azur and almost lost his arm.  I also fail to see how even if a Fuel Rod didn't do damage (which I don't believe anyway) it has any bearing on a bullet piercing one of the spots that doesn't have armor plating over it (which has happened)
HaloStory,3df8hu,asianedy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"In FoR, they said that the suit could stop all small arms fire. Which means no bullet is getting through."

HaloStory,3df8hu,KevinLee487,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"By combined fire, I think they meant getting shot by multiple guns. Basically the shield has to stop simultaneous bullets in multiple locations which probably takes a lot more power."

HaloStory,3df8hu,US_N1NJA_SLAYER,5,Wed Jul 15 22:29:50 2015 UTC,exactly in real life the turret would obviously kill way faster than the small weapons but it would be OP if they treated the gameplay like it was real life.
HaloStory,3df8hu,asianedy,2,Wed Jul 15 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"This is why I always wanted some kind of Arma type Halo game, where everything is super realistic. The Covenant would actually seem scary, and Spartans would actually seem god like."

HaloStory,3df8hu,Quaskie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Most logical explanation I can take is that the DMR's bullets are more bigger & powerful, so you don't need too many, while the turret's are smaller and less powerful, so you need several more to break shields."
HaloStory,3df8hu,PairyHenis96,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:57:48 2015 UTC,Turrets such as the one on the Warthog are .50 cal. No way a DMR(7.62mm) is stronger.

HaloStory,3df8hu,stylz168,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:06 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at it, tell me what you think.  An energy shield works by deflecting the force and energy of an incoming projectile, thus weakening it in that location due to bowing effect. This would be similar to how Kevlar takes incoming force and energy from a projectile and flattens it against the layers, distorting the projectile and causing the force and energy to be spread out.   With a DMR or BR, which is reasonably accurate, one can assume that multiple rounds hitting the same damaged area would penetrate easier, which is the case with Kevlar, and which can also be applied theoretically to energy shields. Most of the turrets have an accuracy rating of Storm Trooper Mk. 2, so sustained fire is needed in order to get 30% hits."
HaloStory,3df8hu,StraightRidahs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, we can see the stream of turret bullets actually hitting the player in-game so that isn't a viable apologetic. The only answer is gameplay necessity-no one wants turrets that kill you in .25 seconds."

HaloStory,3dgrg1,FlatTire2005,5,Sun Jul 19 19:48:13 2015 UTC,I don't think they look completely different.... It's still clearly MJOLNIR armor. There are differences but thats just technology advancing.
HaloStory,3dgrg1,baconfall,2,Thu Jul 16 07:06:17 2015 UTC,A different studios completely. B it's a new gen of armor not a new mark or something. why would it look anything like the old gen.
HaloStory,3dgrg1,VictoriousRaptor,7,Thu Jul 16 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"GEN 1 was Miserah Armory and Catherine Halsey/ONI Section 3. That was it. There was a solid lack of any private funding.   GEN 2 is everyone. GEN 2 is like Microsoft and Windows Phone. There are very set in stone baselines for the armor, everything else is up to whatever contractor wants to burn billions on powered assault armor.   This in the in universe explanation. Many companies. Lots of solutions. He armor is ""pared down"" because no private company has the infinite budget that Halsey had to do whatever. They strip away components that make no sense. They streamline the armor because now it's meant for thousands of users, not dozens. It needs to be far more universal than GEN 1 ever was."
HaloStory,3dgrg1,UnfadingSolace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:27 2015 UTC,I'm confused as to how it needs to be far more universal considering the sheer amount of variants compared to GEN 1.

GEN 1 was Spartan 2s, specifically all the CAT2 Spartans (so we can include those from the S3 class who were capable of wearing the amor).

HaloStory,3dgrg1,TheTimWelsh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:36:06 2015 UTC,I don't know maybe they wanted to keep the style of the Gen 1 armour. I thought it was strange how they went with a completely new look.

It is [suasoria]. Halo Waypoint  Suasoria = a form of declamation in which the student makes a speech which is the soliloquy of an historical figure debating how to proceed at a critical junction in their life.  Short story, he was talking to himself"
HaloStory,3d8xr6,The_Vahki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:26:50 2015 UTC,Okay that's pretty cool actually.
HaloStory,3d8xr6,biosloth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think that could very well be an incorrect understanding. It says a student's soliloquy, and to me that seems to refer to the Iso-Didact."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,MendicantBerger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:15 2015 UTC,Shadow-of-Sundered-Star is the Ur-Didact's name.

HaloStory,3d8xr6,MendicantBerger,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was him speaking to humanity after the events of Halo 4.  Like, you think you defeated me but I'm still here and I'm still going to kick your asses.  He seems to think the Forerunners are back in full power, which considering what's waking up around the galaxy (the Guardians, etc), he may be partially right.  Or he's still just insane after stewing in his Cryptum for 100,000 years without the Domain to fix him, and has a serious case of megalomania."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Rhydnara,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:43 2015 UTC,"I thought so to, but after I just beat it again, I don't know.  It definitely gave me this vibe of the Didacts early encounter with humanity.  When he thought they were invading instead of running.  Like he was trying to rally others to fight against humanity, and that is what gives the sort of disgust in his voice in the epilogue."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Rhydnara,5,Tue Jul 14 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"I think that disgust is at seeing how humans have spread so far across the galaxy.  After so many years of insanity, he doesn't see us as inheritors of the Mantle, or anything positive at all.  He sees humans as a virus, just like the Flood.  He never saw us the same way the Librarian did, but continued to see us as the same vicious plague that killed his children.  I wouldn't be surprised if in future literature/games, he starts to blur the lines between humans and the Flood."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Rhydnara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but humanity was even bigger the first time around, and arguably had done more damage.  His grudge now just comes from the very existence."

HaloStory,3d8xr6,Haruspis,18,Tue Jul 14 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"When did we learn this?   Many catalog posts question this, and the answers we have received so far are really inconclusive. Essentially saying there is some ""inconsistency with the time frame"" when this speech takes place."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,atfsix,19,Tue Jul 14 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"This has never been confirmed, and the speech makes absolutely no sense in a past context. Especially since the Reclamation hasn't even begun yet, the ghost of Cortana says ""the Reclamation is about to begin"", where the Ur-Didact says that it has already begun.  There was no Council at the Greater Ark, the Ur-Didact stayed completely clear of any involvement there because he was waiting to go to Omega Halo to compose the humans there."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Haruspis,5,Tue Jul 14 16:27:05 2015 UTC,The speech could have been made after Halo 4.

HaloStory,3d8xr6,derkerbal,2,Wed Jul 15 01:47:39 2015 UTC,But does that make sense in any sort of context?
HaloStory,3d8xr6,atfsix,7,Tue Jul 14 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"To me it seemed like he was talking to the modern-day Forerunners outside the Galaxy, asking them to return in full force."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,derkerbal,7,Tue Jul 14 20:41:43 2015 UTC,Maybe like the end of Transformers where Optimus sent out the beacon?

HaloStory,3d8xr6,BlindGuardian117,3,Wed Jul 15 20:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was in Path Kethona/Large Magellanic Cloud. The Librarian went there and found the Forerunners who had hunted down the Precursors. They had devolved themselves and lived without technology. At the end of the Forerunner-Flood war Omega Halo was used from the Greater Ark to kill everything in Path Kethona."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,giometrics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"My theory is that it was either what you said, or that he may even be talking to some form of ancilla after being composed at the end of ""The Next 72 Hours"" arc."

HaloStory,3d8xr6,Haruspis,10,Tue Jul 14 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it is happening now instead of in the past.    I stand before you. Accused of the sin of ensuring Forerunner ascendancy. Of attempting to save us from this fate where we are forced to… recede… Humanity stands as the greatest threat in the galaxy  When they were on the Greater Ark, before the Halo's fired, Humanity was on a ring (Omega Halo) and Erde Tyrene (Earth).  Humanity was not a threat at that point in time.  We squander eons in the darkness, while they seize our triumphs for their own  Before the Halo's fired they sure weren't squandering.  And we are now doing this (seizing their ""triumphs"").  Although this quote makes it sound like Forerunners are alive and well in the Galaxy, just not showing their faces."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Molotovn,2,Tue Jul 14 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"I really hadn't thought about it like that before. Now I'm really hoping that there are forerunner somewhere else, or at least a few that we will see in game, enemy or not.   Off topic, but did the rest of the Forerunners know Humanity was the actual inheritor of the Mantle?"
HaloStory,3d8xr6,bewarethetreebadger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:02 2015 UTC,The Iso-Didact and some forerunner survived. But vowed to not interfere in the affairs of the Milky Way again. They had their test and failed and now responsibility was left to the humans. It's in the epilogue of the Forerunner trilogy.
HaloStory,3d8xr6,bewarethetreebadger,2,Wed Jul 15 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, after finishing H4 I decided I wanted to reread the novels again.  So hopefully I retain the story of the Forerunner books a little better this time."
HaloStory,3d8xr6,Pentaplox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're all wrong.. This was a speech he gave during the human v. Forerunner war following the forerunners victory and then discovery that the humans were likely meant to take the mantle, before being tag teamed by the flood and forerunners... Essentially that's what happened, flood attacked humans, forced humans to flee toward forerunners.. Caught between a rock and a hard place and the forerunners wiped then out..."
HaloStory,3d8ppm,Pentaplox,29,Tue Jul 14 11:17:29 2015 UTC,"343i has said that Halo 5 will have some crazy twist and turns. That being said, it would be interesting to have some Bornstellar moments.

HaloStory,3d8ppm,parkerhalo,12,Tue Jul 14 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is what I want to happen, but I think more likely the ""reborn"" part refers to chief going AWOL and regaining his image."

As for James-005, unless somehow he was saved from floating away in space, he's gone too.   As for Red Team (Halo Wars era), unless there is another book or comic tied to the series, I think we've seen the last of them. In Escalations where they show the flood spore in the cryo bay, all the bays look empty."
HaloStory,3d8uex,stylz168,16,Tue Jul 14 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"However, the ship doesn't look very Flood-ified, and the Cryo pods were open, meaning that it likely didn't get the jump on them. I don't think we can make any conclusions yet."
HaloStory,3d8uex,Defguru,6,Tue Jul 14 15:57:59 2015 UTC,"and there was the ""abandon ship"" warning... so maybe they got away"
HaloStory,3d8uex,himynameisjaked,11,Tue Jul 14 22:50:58 2015 UTC,Or we have the first spartan/flood hybrid combat forms..  Good luck with that.
HaloStory,3d8uex,Garandhero,4,Wed Jul 15 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"Jorge may have not died instantly, the half a ship may be in a state of limbo or have been teleported to a different location, however it was likely just atomised. The idea of the mission was to use the slipspace drive to atomise the ship, the inspiration being a malfunctioning drive that atomised a ship. However they may not have made the drive malfunction and instead intended to simply teleport half the carrier away, which would have the same effect and may not instantly atomise everything. Additionally had the half a ship made it into slipspace it is either stuck there or will be completely atomised on re entry as there is nothing to facilitate the ship's re entry into normal space. Assuming the ships were not completely destroyed upon teleportation, Jorge would have most definitely been overrun by a sea of covenant. A story of Jorge's attempted survival in a separate plane of existence with a horde of covenant after him would be pretty bad ass.  TL;DR There is a tiny chance Jorge did not die exactly when we think he did but in every possible outcome of the events he does end up dying."
HaloStory,3d8uex,monk1junk1,6,Wed Jul 15 12:16:50 2015 UTC,"I guess you could talk your way out of Jorge being dead ... I mean he was on the corvette which went into slipspace which would theoretically be fine, it's the Long Night of Solace that would be really messed up."
HaloStory,3d8uex,tblots4,8,Tue Jul 14 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"Slipspace ruptures form outside ships before they go into them, when Jorge fired the slipspace bomb it opened inside the Corvette, it tore him apart."
HaloStory,3d8uex,atfsix,2,Tue Jul 14 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"That's true, my mistake. Slipspace travel has more of a portal than an envelope."
HaloStory,3d8uex,tblots4,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's could be stretching, but there is a significant portion of the Halo player base that never picked up any of the expanded universe content. Those fans only have the games to go by, so I'm sure we will see something at the beginning of Halo 5 which will explain how Blue Team is still alive, etc."
HaloStory,3d8uex,stylz168,2,Tue Jul 14 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm just counting down the time until we find out that an ONI prowler recovered James during the battle of Reach, and he was being held in reserve for some 'last ditched effort' style operation along the lines of getting as many people onto colony ships (or potentially Infinity if it was able to move and enter slip space) and attempting to outrun the covenant. It would make sense that they would want a Spartan for that.   Or hell, forgeting my ""run the hell away"" theory, they could even just say ""Like Naomi, he's been working as a hand of ONI and isn't 'officially' active,"" which I wouldn't mind. Honestly I'd be fine with him coming back. That gives them one more S-II to explore as a character."

HaloStory,3d8uex,AWrenchAndTwoNuts,10,Tue Jul 14 13:40:45 2015 UTC,I believe that is why Black made such an unceremonious exit. Black team and Grey team were essentially the wild cards that were left. In the cannon they both filled the same role. One of them had to go and I'm pretty sure it was just a flip of the coin at 343i as to who was killed off and who will stay around. I have no doubt that Grey team will pop up somewhere. I doubt they will show up in a game but I could see another book or EU appearance soon.
HaloStory,3d8uex,AWrenchAndTwoNuts,4,Tue Jul 14 14:20:21 2015 UTC,yea grey team seemed more elite. But team black was...nice :C

A year is a bit of a stretch for a team to be out of contact for, if they haven't called in after a decade; they're dead.  If Grey is alive, 343 has some SERIOUS ret-conning to do. Considering the amount of work that would be involved with bringing Grey back (Ensuring their existence ties in nicely with the rest of the story, ret-conning the appropriate parts, explaining where they've been) it doesn't look as if Grey will be brought back as active characters.

HaloStory,3d6nst,VictoriousRaptor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"The reason I said Osman magic is that Lasky was ONI's first pick to be the captain of the Infinity, but politics lead him to be the XO instead."

HaloStory,3d4zry,TheEld,23,Mon Jul 13 18:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think that was a cop out to help retcon the novels with the game. Spartan 3's in mjoliner, no mention of the spartan 2's on the ground. The POA being able to come into Reach's atmosphere with the Chief already in cryo. Cortana being fragmented.   Bungie just did what they wanted despite what The Fall of Reach had established."
HaloStory,3d4zry,happypants69,14,Mon Jul 13 18:19:47 2015 UTC,No mention of the SPARTAN-IIs on the ground? Did you never listen to the radio conversations scattered throughout the game?  http://www.halopedia.org/Halo:_Reach_radio_conversations

May also explain why the S-IIIs were so surprised to hear that Red was on civilian evac duty, especially considering that one of their own members had just been on such duty. It would be seen as acceptable for S-IIIs to be on evac but odd to assign S-IIs to evac."

HaloStory,3d4zry,Toa_Freak,4,Mon Jul 13 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Have Keyes drop off Blue Team, and before cutting to Blue Team, show him getting a call from Dr. Halsey. Or do this just after Keyes picks up Blue Team. No need to actually show it, just reference it.  Master Chief noted that, on the day he went to receive Cortana and his Mk. V, the marines on guard duty seemed kind of wound up, anxious. Make a reference to the larger battle being kept from the Chief at this point. It'd be so easy.  Make reference to Halsey's location at certain points during August of 2552 (since she was kind of jumping around between Castle and Sword Base)."

HaloStory,3d9d94,Cabbaggio,2,Tue Jul 14 18:47:37 2015 UTC,I believe they're all pretty self contained stories. I've never read them though (only seen the summaries for each issue) because I feel like nothing important can really happen in them since 343 can't expect most fans to read the comics.
HaloStory,3d9d94,HalfBredGerman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:39 2015 UTC,I guess the best part of Escalation is the multiple arcs.  It's not one continuous story.

HaloStory,3d4n3i,HeyLudaYouLikeToEat,27,Mon Jul 13 14:16:31 2015 UTC,I've always like the Sangheili as allies more than enemies. I hope there's going to be significantly more Human-Sangheili cooperation in Halo 5.  I'll also take this opportunity to repost my examination of Sanghelios.
HaloStory,3d4n3i,In_Medias_Res,12,Mon Jul 13 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"I like them both as allies and opponents. They have the capacity for vicious, terrifying violence, and noble, defiant camaraderie. Fighting head to head or back to back with them is always rad.  I enjoy the dynamic of assisting the Swords of Sanghelios against the Covenant Remnant just as much as I enjoyed taking on Brutes and The Flood alongside Arbiter and his forces."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,GoldPilot,3,Mon Jul 13 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"They have the capacity for vicious, terrifying violence, and noble, defiant camaraderie.   When you think of it, so do humans.

HaloStory,3d4n3i,uhhguy,12,Tue Jul 14 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Elites have always been my favourite enemy. They're difficult to fight, very intelligent and special. Halo CE Elites are probably my favourite iteration, with Halo 2 and Reach close behind.  Halo CE's Elites are also closest to what I think the Sangheili should represent. They are very ""officer like"" and aristocratic, clearly superior to other Covenant species. They aren't too aggressive either. They are more cunning warriors and leaders than savage aliens...  and then there's this!"

Must've taken me 40 minutes and required the two luckiest plasma grenade sticks in my campaign career.  However, my luckiest 'stick' was when I actually killed someone by throwing a random Pulse Grenade across the map in Halo 4 SWAT. I think it might have been the first time in Halo matchmaking history that someone actually got a kill with those useless fucking grenades."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,StraightRidahs,3,Tue Jul 14 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"I think Pulse Grenades are supposed to be tactical (block off a hallway, force someone out of cover, etc) rather than offensive (killing people directly). Doesn't explain why 343 put the commendations in for killing loads of players with them, but an easy way to get those, I find, is to use them when boarding a vehicle.  Also, you have a huge level of patience to do that for 40 minutes. Kudos to you."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,MajorThom98,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sure they'd be useful in a competitive game where teammates are working together, but they're soooo out of place in unorganized matchmaking deathmatch games, they just feel odd.

HaloStory,3d4n3i,HiddenXperia,4,Tue Jul 14 10:36:29 2015 UTC,reach was pretty damn awesome in terms of designs. Liked that the best
HaloStory,3d4n3i,YeoBean,3,Tue Jul 14 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did like Reach's design, but for me it still didn't top H2/3. They just looked so superior and cool."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,HiddenXperia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:37:59 2015 UTC,"Their faces in reach look very weird up close. I'd actually say that one of the only things 343 did right was with the elite models, the face looks top notch, they look huge and menacing yet still agile, but they ruined it all by putting stupid looking armor onto them."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,RayGunn_26,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'll admit the plasma rifle didn't catch my eye when I first played Halo CE, and until finding the brute plasma rifle in H2 I still didn't care for it. However in H3, I fell in love with it and have gone back to CE and H2 and found out on what I was missing. A flexible, fiercesome weapon."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,captainconway,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"Same here dude, I think it was at it's peak whilst duel wielded in H3. I used to hear people complain constantly when I'd kill them in under a second with a quick dual plasma rifle burst followed by a melee."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,HiddenXperia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:37:29 2015 UTC,"Frankly I'd be glad if they just replaced the storm rifle with the bad-ass looking plasma repeater. The repeater took the awesome plasma rifle and mage it cooler, the only downside was the mechanics, but fuck, it was fun."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,RPGX400,2,Wed Jul 15 05:04:33 2015 UTC,"I have a respect for the repeater, since it was good for what it was. However, the rifle is still paramount."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,captainconway,10,Wed Jul 15 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"I really have enjoyed the way that we have learned more and more about the Sanghelli throughout the series and at the same time, they themselves have gone through changes. They are, naturally, prime warriors and deserve the pride their people regard so highly. However, there are plenty of limitations on what they can achieve for various reasons: Be it the coercion they suffered under the San Shyuum, their disdain for medicine, or the ferverently fragmented state of their current politics.   On the other hand, I appreciate how they are so different from humanity in certain lights, while being quite the same in a good number of regards. The differences between them are perceptible and allow for us to at least comprehend the contrast, unlike the purely alien differences between say, humanity, and the Leekgolo or the Yan'me and their unique hive/geshtalt mentalities.  I really appreciate the diversity within the Sanghelli and the fact that they can now have a wide diversity of factions among them, just like humanity does. Some still have a fanatical hatred, others are more willing to work and come together, while still there are some that only wish to be left alone.  As far as in game combat, the best part about their role, hands down, is the way in which they influence the player in developing new tactics. The sanghelli are not just powerful or imposing enemies, but they are clever ones too. The whole concept of  them having recharging energy shields lends a certain style of play that disallows someone to just whittle down the damage over time and making the most of their in game abilities. Instead, environments are used as both opportunities and challenges wherein encountering certain Sanghelli, with particular weapons, around a specific environment will yield a completely different fight than roughly similar circumstances and only a few minor tweaks.    Altogether, the Sanghelli stand as a true exemplar of what makes Halo define itself. I have enjoyed their evolving role in every game (save their hiatus in ODST) so far and look forward to them sticking around for the foreseeable future."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,captainconway,9,Mon Jul 13 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"The Sangheili are, without a doubt, my favorite alien race of any video game. They look badass (apart from the new Dunce hats 343 call ""helmets""), they are incredible warriors, they are intelligent, and they have a sense of honor that no alien race besides humans can understand. I get absolutely giddy whenever I read a new Halo novel and I get to read about scenes or perspectives of Sangheili (for this reason Hunters in the Dark was awesome). They're just completely awesome, in every way."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Megawatts19,6,Mon Jul 13 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the reason why Halo 4 Sangheili had such a vast different anatomy was due to them coming from Haesduros after Jul scooped them all up. In Halo 5 now, I wonder why the Sangheili still look like Haesduros Sangheili and not the Elites from Halo 2 Anniversary or Halo 3. Also has anybody noticed if Thel 'Vadam's model is the Halo 4 model or the Halo 2 Anniversary model?"
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Arbiter789,3,Mon Jul 13 16:13:03 2015 UTC,The reason the Elites all look the same in 5 is because they apparently didn't have enough time make them look different. Which is kinda weird. And Halo 5 Thel has a Halo 4 Elite model.
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Ornaren,6,Mon Jul 13 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"Dang. I was hoping at least Thel would look like the one from that Halo 5 sneak peak cutscene in Halo MCC. Hell I wish the Elites looked like the ones they portrayed on that cutscene. In my opinion, I think the Haesduros Sangheili don't look Sangheili at all, minus the body, arms, hands, legs, and hooves."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Arbiter789,4,Mon Jul 13 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm confused why they couldn't give different Elites variation in mandible shape, since that's one of the more noticeable differences between Elites, and it wouldn't seem like it'd take too much trouble compared to other things they've done."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Ornaren,3,Mon Jul 13 19:21:27 2015 UTC,I know right? The mandibles are the only thing that's cringe worthy in my eyes. It's the only thing that annoys me so much with 343i's Elites. There should be more variation other then just faction colors on the armor or friendly dots on the radar.
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Arbiter789,6,Mon Jul 13 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Sangheili are definitely one of my most favorite fictional races. Which is one reason why it's so disappointing to me they're not playable in Halo 5. I just hope they might be able to be DLC. But I would absolutely love a game with an exclusive Elite PC. A lot of story possibilities there, too. An ancient Arbiter, or maybe a modern shipmaster or relic hunter.  Though I also heard from some tweet that Elites are apparently color-blind and see purple as blue. That really doesn't make much sense to me, considering they use blue and purple to differentiate different armor types."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,Ornaren,4,Mon Jul 13 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Reach Elites were the most scary of them all. Their black eyes look like sharks, and the higher the rank, the more intimidating they are and how aggressive their fighting style is, despite they're no brutes. They also used the most variety of weapons which added to their fighting style. They're more intimidating than the 4 and 5 elites, but I'll admit the 4/5 elites are more zealous and ferocious since they took the fighting style from the brutes. But even then they're nothing like the Reach elites."
HaloStory,3d4n3i,darth_taco_117,4,Tue Jul 14 02:08:10 2015 UTC,Reach elites were definitely my favorite. Their size compared to the player made them terrifying.

HaloStory,3d4n3i,captainconway,2,Wed Jul 15 07:39:58 2015 UTC,"CE also had a fair amount of ""stealth"" opportunities, like with assault on the control room where you could silently take out around 80% of the enemies (not much of a choice for the outdoor/vehicle sections.

HaloStory,3d4n3i,Grandmaofhurt,2,Tue Jul 14 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"I love the Sangheili, their culture, their values and the intense martial aspect that pervades everything they do. They make some of the best warriors in the Milky Way and they don't need power armor to augment their strength. The only issue is they are incredibly predictable and honor-bound which can be easily used against them, only certain humans share that sort of Ed Stark type honor and when they do it is not to the level of a Sangheili so we as humans can use that against them and many Sangheili despise humans specifically for their two-facedness, but what is honor when you're dead?"

HaloStory,3d5e98,Airbornequalified,4,Tue Jul 14 01:32:11 2015 UTC,Canon explanation is probably along the lines is the majority of the trilogy is from chakras point of view and he never heard anyone mention it. Or maybe it is not super well known that WE existed everyone just took the domain for granted much as we do with the internet today and don't know who maintains it.
HaloStory,3d5e98,Raptorclaw621,4,Mon Jul 13 19:13:20 2015 UTC,I believe the Domain was 'maintained' by intermediaries sort of like priests collectively called Haruspis.

HaloStory,3d3y8q,In_Medias_Res,5,Mon Jul 13 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"... established colonies on 800 different planets.   There's probably far more colonies by 2557 given that statistic was taken in 2490, not to mention that a significant amount of Human colonies are on moons and other non-planetary bodies.   Earth begins losing control of these worlds, and is on the brink of civil war.   The Insurrection is a civil war.   In order to prevent the full-on outbreak of war, a scientist for the UNSC ... Dr. Catherine Halsey came up with the idea of creating a group of soldiers to bring stability to Human-occupied space.   Dr. Halsey and ONI started their supersoldier programs in order to combat the growing insurgency in the colonies, not to prevent it from happening altogether.   This idea became known as the SPARTAN-II program.   The SPARTAN-II program came after the ORION project and before the SPARTAN-III program, all of which used Dr. Halsey's ideas.   The candidates were young children, ages four to six, who were kidnapped, indoctrinated, and raised as soldiers from this very young age.    The only Class I SPARTAN-II not born in 2511 was Kelly-087, who was born in September 2510, one year before the birth of Kurt-051, the youngest candidate, in October 2511. SPARTAN-II abductions began in September 2517, therefore all of the candidates were abducted at the ages of 6 or 7. Both of the Class II SPARTANs were six or seven years old when abducted, too, with the exception of the SPARTAN-1.1 Janissary James.   They were then surgically, genetically, and cybernetically enhanced   SPARTAN-II augmentations do not affect the body on a genetic level.   augmentations would cripple 42 out of 75 of the trainees.   Only 12 trainees were crippled. Another 30 were killed.   the SPARTANs, who never lost a single battle while fighting on the ground.   The SPARTANs were present at quite a few lost battles, including the Fall of Circinius IV, the Fall of Reach, various battles in the Harvest Campaign, and the Massacre at Eridanus Secundus.   Cortana sent the Pillar of Autumn into a slipspace jump to a random point in space that she had deciphered from ancient alien ruins found in one of her encounters with the Covenant.   Cortana's decision was not random, it was based on coordinates received from the Sigma Octanus IV artifact and Babd Catha Forerunner installation.   The Pillar of Autumn now emerges ... unbeknownst to the Humans, the Covenant were waiting on the other side of the planet already.   The Covenant were in pursuit of the Pillar of Autumn, and did not wait for the UNSC to arrive before making preparations to land on Installation 04.   ... the Master Chief goes on a solo mission to Halo's map room, as well as its control room.   The Battle of the Silent Cartographer involved three pelicans-worth of UNSC personnel, with reinforcements arriving later.   the Flood, a parasite as old as the Forerunners themselves.   The Flood, if you don't count their past as the Precursors, are millions of years younger than the Forerunners. If you do count their past, they are billions of years older than the Forerunners.   Master Chief escapes [Halo] and beings his long trek back to Earth and Halo 2 begins.   This skips over everything from the Skirmish over Threshold to Operation: FIRST STRIKE, integral parts of the story.   the three Covenant leaders, or ""Prophets""   The entire race of San'Shyuum are known as ""Prophets"". Truth, Mercy, and Regret were the High Prophets or Hierarchs.   Master Chief ... kills the Prophet of Regret, which makes the Covenant believe that Elites were no longer fit to protect the Prophets   Holy tense problems, Batman! Regardless, the San'Shyuum had long been conspiring to replace the Sangheili with the Jiralhanae.   The Gravemind is the combined consciousness of the entire Flood segment that has been spreading around, so it's the brain.   The Gravemind is the combined consciousness of all Flood, not just local ones.   Master Chief witnesses the Prophet of Mercy being attacked and infected by the Flood, leaving only one remaining Prophet: the Prophet of Truth.   John-117 destroyed the infection form, giving Mercy a merciful death. Truth was the last of the Hierarchs, but not the last of the San'Shyuum.   the Prophet of Truth, who is on his way to Earth to activate all the remaining Halo rings   Truth intended to do this from the Ark, not Earth. Earth was merely the location of the Portal at Voi.   the Covenant are digging up a huge Forerunner artifact in the middle of the African continent   And by middle of the continent, he of course means off the east coast. The Portal was literally covered by ocean before the Covenant began their work to uncover it.   Once they reach the Ark's control room, Miranda Keyes is found dead   This guy seems to want to erase Miranda Keyes from the story, seeing as he passes over her presence on Cairo Station, mentions her in passing when chasing Regret to Installation 05, doesn't even mention that she's the one who reclaimed the Index on Delta Halo, disregards that she was leading the UNSC offensive in Africa, and now neglects how she piloted the pelican that stopped Truth from activating the Halos before John-117 and the Arbiter could deactivate the firing sequence.   ancient Humans were so advanced they could practically go toe-to-toe with the Forerunners.   They did go toe-to-toe with the Forerunners, while simultaneously fighting the Flood.   In an attempt to escape the Flood the Humans resorted to attacking Forerunner worlds.   Humanity glassed Forerunner worlds in order to purge them, and prevent the Flood from spreading.   the Didact finally defeated Humanity and left the remaining primitive population back on Earth ... the Didact used the machine known as the Composer on a portion of the now-vulnerable Human race   Might be helpful to mention that these Humans were on Omega Halo.   The Didact took these digitized Human minds and put them inside war machines bodies which would become known as Promethean Knights.   Promethean Knights were already a thing, starting with Forerunners, then digitized Forerunners, and eventually digitized Humans.   ... but Master Chief is able to survive [the Composer] because of the enhancements that were given to him by the Librarian.   This is entirely correct, but not in the way the narrator thinks. The Librarian implanted a geas to withstand the Composer in the Human genome during the Conservation Measure millennia ago, and activated that geas in John-117 before the Didact escaped Requiem.  Anyways, it's interesting that in a video summarizing the lore of the Halo universe that the narrator leaves out the Precursors, the early Covenant, most of the events after Halo 4, and about a dozen other critical plot threads."
HaloStory,3d3y8q,In_Medias_Res,4,Mon Jul 13 13:00:09 2015 UTC,"While your points are valid, I think it's fair to not assume a 15 minute video could explain all of that.

HaloStory,3d1gcs,Jabberwaky,47,Sun Jul 12 19:08:21 2015 UTC,Mendez did say Spartans could improve their performance (strength/speed) as they get older because their bodies grow more accustomed to the augmentations. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the Mjolnir armour doubles the users strength.
HaloStory,3d1gcs,MajesticShadow104,16,Sun Jul 12 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"I thought it was much more than double? But I have absolutely no facts so you may be right. But just like any other thing, practice can make anything better, so the more time they spend in their suits and with their augmentations, the better they get. In theory of coarse."

It's possible that the SII's GEN2 armor still is only as powerful as their GEN1 Mark VI.  EDIT: If I'm wrong, why do you think Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris have the same gameplay in Halo 5? If the SII's GEN2 armor made them that much stronger, there would be noticeable gameplay differences."
HaloStory,3d1gcs,Ardusk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if you think about it in terms of a non-augmented human.  If a person was at their peak physical fitness at the age of 18 and at the age of 25-30, wouldn't you think the older person would be the more physically capable one.  I would think augmented folk would follow a similar pattern.  Probably in a sci-fi universe like Halo where the average life expectancy is likely higher, than a person would probably be closer to 40 before they reach their physical prime."

HaloStory,3d2np9,darth_taco_117,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:52 2015 UTC,"How did Locke become a spartan after Nightfall?   I'm not sure what you mean. He was considered a capable soldier by ONI well before these events, so him becoming a Spartan-IV was pretty practical.   How did Buck become a spartan after ODST?   Detailed in Halo: New Blood. In short, he was offered to join the first class (Sarah Palmer's class), but turned it down. Halo: New Blood Spoilers   How does Tanaka get involved in Team Osiris?   Unknown at the moment, but I have a feeling the current story arc in Halo Escalation might answer that.   Who is Vale and how is she involved?   Halo: Hunters in the Dark Spoilers   Why is Catherine Halsey behaving the way she is in Escalation?   Do you mean to ask why she's helping Jul? It's because he isn't currently trying to kill her, and is willing to help her in return. It's an alliance of convenience and necessity. Otherwise, Halsey would be dead or imprisoned.   What led to her being incriminated for the Spartan program? And her alone?   The short answer is that ONI needed a scapegoat. The long answer is the Kilo-5 trilogy (which does a terrible job and is just utterly confusing, never mind the utterly terrible retcons it makes to justify it's BS)."
HaloStory,3d2np9,Toa_Freak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"Read Glasslands, has a blurb about how ONI's ex-CINC Parangosky grows a conscience at the Spartan II program (funny enough, she has no problem with the Spartan III program, which created disposable soldiers) over Halsey's use of clones to replace the children abducted. Her plan was to bring everything to light, with everyone's involvement out in the open.   What I find interesting is how it has become ""common knowledge"" that the S-II program involved abducting children."
HaloStory,3d2np9,stylz168,2,Mon Jul 13 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"What I find interesting is how it has become ""common knowledge"" that the S-II program involved abducting children.   It really hasn't. Rumors about the origins of the Spartan-II program have been circulating through the military for years, and is nothing new to the fiction. But that's all they are: rumor. Buck was still shocked to discover this truth when he was told by Jun, and DeMarco was laughing it off as a joke at first when he was told by Madsen (the latter of which was the son a high-ranking Officer)."
HaloStory,3d2np9,Toa_Freak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, just feels like it should be this closely guarded secret, yet every book throws it around like it's normal. In Mortal Dictata for example, you see Naomi's dad doing calendar math when he finds out that she's still alive, and the author goes to great lengths to point that out to us."
HaloStory,3d2np9,stylz168,2,Mon Jul 13 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"I won't deny that the way it's thrown around in the books sometimes bothers me.

HaloStory,3d13x6,thisismyfirstday,3,Sun Jul 12 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"Goodness, this is the third definition of the word 'soma' and they keep making more and more sense.  The first definition I saw was the scientific term that refers to the cell body of a neuron. So I thought ""oh, maybe she was a Lifeworker before she cast aside her rate"".  The second definition I saw was ""the body as distinct from the soul, mind, or psyche"". This made perfect sense to me, as it tied into the whole idea of Forerunner detachment and some concepts of the Mantle.  And now I hear this...

HaloStory,3d13x6,0mni42,5,Sun Jul 12 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"Soma the Painter is one of the foundational pieces of lore for the Forerunners, in just four short pages it tells us SO MUCH about their culture and society. It's a story that a lot of people have sort of skipped over, and many find confusing because it's so different to many other pieces of Halo media, so I thought it would be a good idea to explore some of the seeds it planted that the Forerunner Saga later picked up on."

HaloStory,3czl0y,BurningPlaydoh,15,Sun Jul 12 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"Well it's complicated. It seems to be something in between Precursors and Flood. I believe he was once a Precursor that survived the olde war, and did something to himself, not turning into a powder, but something else, to avoid detection. Someone believed he was imprisoned by the Precursors themselves. I can't remember if I read that on this subreddit or if someone in the book said it.  So now that the Flood have emerged, and they use Neural Physics (some sort of instantaneous biological connection to the Universe) to link every body together to a single consciousness, and we know Precursors have the same connection. So now it seems like the Precursors, essentially just the Primordial now, seems to have melded with the Flood by this connection. So when the Primordial 'died', he didn't truly die, because his consciousness was already one with the Flood at that point. I make this assumption because it's clear the Flood are a single consciousness, there is no individuality and every single body, combat form, infection form, tentacled-gravemind or key mind is all the same entity. The Gravemind we see in the games is the same 'person' who was once the Primordial. Cool to think about.  Anyway, that's how I interpreted the whole thing, but honestly, the Primordial was very vague so we could all be wrong in our interpretation of what happened."

HaloStory,3czl0y,tblots4,7,Sun Jul 12 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"This thought occurred to me, maybe the Primordial was locked away precisely because it thought as it did. I always imagined Precursors as benevolent creators, and maybe this one saw the Forerunners for the threat they were and spoke out, for which he (it?) was imprisoned. He would sort of be the hard liner Ur-Didact of his time then, imprisoned and outliving his entire species."

I havent yet read Silentium but this wasnt mentioned in anything else I could find about it.  Edit: Went and checked; humans discovered it already in the stasis capsule.  From the timing it sounds like it could have been after the first emergence of the Flood.  Still doesnt make sense that the first Gravemind of sorts would seal itself away during that time.  Edit 2: More reading, it was placed in stasis millions of years before the human discovery of the powder."

And I'd also love to see some more media that explores civilian life in the Halo universe, and romance comes as a natural part of that.  Overall, I am very much in favor of exploring different aspects of the Halo universe and the people in it, no matter what they may be.  (Also, more space battles are always a good thing. Always.)"
HaloStory,3cyq17,TheEld,0,Sun Jul 12 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"It's an FPS, romance is pretty far from my list of expectation when I pick up an fps, not to mention the clunky romances that result from fps writing teams attempting to shoehorn a decent romantic subplot into a game that is essentially just variations on a general theme of ""it ain't human, it ain't got a right to live"" Above and beyond that, I think it's ridiculous to try to cram all of the elements of a book into a game, people aren't there to learn to love the plucky cadet despite his foibles, they're here to beat the game and kill some aliens. You want romance? Grab a book or go outside"
HaloStory,3cyq17,scruffychef,11,Sun Jul 12 12:42:41 2015 UTC,Halo is a universe and story. Some parts of that story are told through FPS games.

Yes it's an fps, that easy how it was born, and therefore how the overwhelming majority of it's fan base came to find it. Logically this tells us that the fan base is made up of people who enjoyed the video game and stuck around for more of the same. The books are great, but they're just the video game's story fleshed out and explored in ways that the games haven't or couldn't.  Before you jump in and say ""well then why not explore the romance?"" I'll nip that in the bud. Ever read a Tom Clancy novel?  They're by and large much like the halo books, military setting, military hierarchy governs social interractions etc. The female characters in all those ""war novels"" are presented as either the reason for fighting, the reason to go back home, or as a maternal figure. The romance isn't there because the  customers isn't looking for it. Halo is militaristic Sci fi, with more detail given to describing weapons than characters physical features. You're looking in the wrong place"

HaloStory,3cyq17,scruffychef,5,Sun Jul 12 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"Of course there's no romance in The Fall of Reach. It's about the origin of the SPARTAN-IIs (most of whom lost any kind of sex drive thanks to their augmentations), and the life of John leading up to Operation: RED FLAG and the subsequent descovery of Alpha Halo."
HaloStory,3cyq17,TheEld,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. So we agree then, that the introduction of halo was a romance-free affair, and that said, the fans who came in droves to support the content they enjoyed in those early ""no-romo"" halo titles are probably not itching for new halo titles packed full of unnecessary romantic subplots"
HaloStory,3cyq17,scruffychef,6,Sun Jul 12 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of romance in Halo, though.. Halo takes place in its own world. There are children born in that world..

HaloStory,3cyq17,atfsix,0,Sun Jul 12 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Did I say anything about the story? No. I did not. The halo story is pretty grand and far reaching, it encorporates some fantastic highs and lows of human emotion, however it focuses on the perspectives of soldiers on the front lines, if not behind enemy lines. This doesn't allow a huge amount of room for a ""natural"" feeling romance. Some notable exceptions include John Forge and Dr Anderson (Anders?) From Halo Wars, and the by play between Buck and Vero nice in ODST. But those relationships wouldn't work in a Spartans mind, the Augmentation of the Spartan 2s supressed their sex drive significantly, it's actually mentioned in one of the more recent(ish) novels that of all the Spartans who survived auentation only  the woman who dropped out of the spartan program went on to have any long term emotional bonds. Halsey talks about John 117 and Cortana, but that's a platonic/maternal relationship.  Since we're starting to see more ODST and other non-augmented characters in the novels we may see more opportunities for romance, but frankly the majority of the fan base would ignore/skip it in game, and a significant portion would likely bitch about how out of place any romance is in what is supposed to be a universe in chaos, viewed from behind the visors of the men and women who are hard pressed to find time to reload, let alone  exchange phone numbers"
HaloStory,3cyq17,FlatTire2005,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"Mac and Sif in Contact: Harvest was done well, and there have been others. They fit in enough romance without issues, I think they're doing fine."
HaloStory,3cyq17,Flibber_Gibbet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all assertions that John and Cortana were in love. I see them as two entities with a bond that transcends family and friend: they harbor no sexual or romantic feelings for each other, but are so connected that they are nearly two halves of the same entity. Thus, in the games, the only romance we have is Buck and Dare.  I think there is certainly more room for characters to have feelings for one another, now that they're all being fleshed out. I've always found it somewhat odd that none of the characters ever seem to care about each other on a personal level. Anders and Forge were the only real exception I can think of off the top of my head.  Edit: I also like the idea that John has a thing for Linda."

HaloStory,3cxwlf,parkerhalo,49,Sat Jul 11 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just spitballing here, but it could be that a melee attack from a spartan is incredibly powerful. Think about it, its a heavy ass suit of armor encasing a genetically augmented super person. They can probably punch with a force powerful enough to stop the shield. Even if it is less forceful than a bullet, it has a larger surface area, which (correct me if I'm wrong) would break the shield easier."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,MichaelJ_Caboose,28,Sat Jul 11 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember in the Fall of Reach when they were first demonstrating the Mjolnir armour to the Spartan-IIs, an ordinary non-augmented soldier was killed just by the action of moving his arm in the suit, I think. It shows how powerful an augmented human in Mjolnir armour can be."

HaloStory,3cxwlf,nebblord,37,Sat Jul 11 20:35:12 2015 UTC,He was overwhelmed by his pain shivers which translated in the suit to rather intense motions. He literally could not stop himself and it basically tore him to pieces from the inside
HaloStory,3cxwlf,ThoughtLock,15,Sat Jul 11 21:06:09 2015 UTC,When I first read that part it made me shiver from thinking about how much force that would be to literally rip a person apart
HaloStory,3cxwlf,fuzzypyrocat,5,Sun Jul 12 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"No, more surface area means less pressure. That would make it easier for the shield to hold up, if anything - the shield is either gonna be concerned with force or pressure."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,robcap,9,Sat Jul 11 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"Higher pressure would make it easier to penetrate the shield perhaps, as it would impart less energy on the shield, retaining more itself, but the greater surface area would allow the larger projectile to better transfer it's energy, which I'd think would be of more use in actually dissipating the shield."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,TomShoe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"Debatable. The guns infantry use are not recoilless yes? And a marine can aim it just fine. Now a spartan, augmented by a suit that grants him the ability to lift 2 tons, would be able to punch with a massive amount of force. I'm not sure how energy shields work, but because most of the time you overload the entire shield rather than piercing it, the pressure per cm2 is probably not gonna matter. Just the force. Bullets hit with very little force (in total)and that's why I think they are so weak against shields"

HaloStory,3cxwlf,MichaelJ_Caboose,22,Sun Jul 12 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"A punch from a non-armored Spartan can kill a normal person. See: young John vs ODSTs.  A MJOLNIR suit can kill a non-augmented person trying to operate it.  So a Spartan in MJOLNIR can punch really, really hard - enough to break the shields of another MJOLNIR.  The question I ask is, why does the opposite impact from the punch have no effect on the wearer's shields? I suspect though it's just the shields modulating away from the wearer's fist, as the system is smart enough to brace for the impact overall without their assistance. Similar to how shields are modulated away from the bottom of the boots to improve traction (otherwise they'd be very slippery), although in Halo 5 a combination of actuators and a deliberate, controlled loss of traction seems to be the explanation for the slide mechanic."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,Skrimyt,5,Sat Jul 11 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"This makes me think, a lot of the melee animations hit with the weapon. So how come the weapons aren't instantly mangled when battered against something with such force? I think this is the real question."

HaloStory,3cxwlf,monk1junk1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Well some weapons like some variants of the magnum were 'upscaled' to be fit for Spartan use since it was difficult to use the smaller guns while wearing Mjolnir. Could be that these 'Spartan' variants of guns were made with stronger materials to handle more powerful users.  Or could be that since titanium is in plentiful supply in the Halo universe that it (and titanium-based alloys) are used more freely in weapon parts and mechanisms.  Or it's the future and there are synthetic materials capable of handling a lot more punishment than any modern materials in the real world.  Or it's too taxing and too annoying to add in animations, models, textures and features for gun breaking in the game."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,Trinitykill,23,Tue Jul 14 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"Is The Cole Protocol, a member of Spartan Gray Team breaks Captain Keyes out of the asteroid jail by ripping the bars out of the rock.   I don't know the math to calculate this, but generally speaking the kinetic energy transfer of a bullet isn't that huge since it's a small projectile moving very quickly. All ballistic technology since the spear has been designed to pierce people. Squishy people. And sometimes the armor of the times too.   A Mjolnir assisted Spartan punch does more damage than the warthog chain gun, which is 12 point something mm, which is comparable to .50 BMG, which is that big ass mother what you shoot that guys arm off with in cod 4.  Physics bitch."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,throwaray_ray,8,Sat Jul 11 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"Actually high velocity rounds (rifles) very much rely on transfer of kinetic energy for their stopping power. The shockwave they generate on contact with matter causes massive trauma, beyond their direct path of travel- you can watch videos of the impacts into ballistics gel to see this in action. Lower velocity rounds such as pistols and SMG do rely more on actually poking holes though.  Edit- Just to provide the basic physics behind it: Energy=1/2×mass×(velocity2). As an exponential variable, higher velocity provides much more energy than higher mass. Speed kills, as they say!"
HaloStory,3cxwlf,JMAC426,2,Sat Jul 11 22:13:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I wanted to go a little more into cavitation and higher power cartridges but I didn't want to talk out of my ass too much.   I was more or less thinking about the relationship of halo shields being punched/shot compared to today's body armor. Kinda like how kevlar is good at catching smallish bullets,  but doesn't protect as much from getting stabbed. Same as how a spartan punch does more than a .50 cal in game.   Also, game balance and future magic."
HaloStory,3cxwlf,throwaray_ray,3,Sun Jul 12 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"No problem! I think of the shields as a deflector system- the shields can divert the course of a low mass bullet relatively easily (since F=ma, a small force can apply a high acceleration/deceleration rate) so it misses altogether or glances off the armour. A physical blow, however, has much more mass behind it and therefore overwhelms the available power of the shields.  And yes, also space magic haha."

HaloStory,3cxwlf,Raptorclaw621,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"Totally a guess, but something to consider about a melee attack versus a rifle round: the melee attack will keep pushing, so it's not just a matter of F=(1/2)xmassxvelocity2  While the shield may be perfectly capable of stopping the fist, the continued application of pressure could put a lot more strain on it. (Especially since a MJOLNIR-equipped Spartan probably punches with similar force to a rifle round, and it only takes a few of those to pop the shields in the first place.)  Edit: rephrased a sentence because I am anal about these things. ""the shield"" -> ""it"""
HaloStory,3cxwlf,YCobb,5,Sun Jul 12 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"A punch from a Spartan is like getting into a less than 50mph car wreck. I mean they can flip tanks with the flick of their wrist, you're talking demi god strength augmented by a super iron man suit. It's like how the rail gun is a one shot kill. Honestly its a little unrealistic that anything can take more than one hit from a Spartan. Maybe a brute makes sense but the elites should fold like paper against an Abrams."

HaloStory,3cz2va,vincemisfit,7,Sun Jul 12 04:03:55 2015 UTC,Sangheili spec ops influence. There's a motion comic of Head Hunters and the Sangheili spec op units are unique and actually are very similar to Locke's armor.

HaloStory,3cyikd,Justonecharactershor,4,Wed Jul 15 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"I would strongly recommend you do not start by order of chronology. If you're doing a reread only than would it provide perspective, but for a first read-thru you have to start with Fall of Reach as it's pretty much the universally accepted start to the Halo franchise and sets up for the first Halo game. Greg Bear's Forerunner trilogy is a sci-fantasy lore series that doesn't feel or even really connect at all with the heavy on the ""science"" fiction of Eric Nylund.  As with the other books that ""chronologically"" bridge the gap between these two authors, namely Broken Circle, Contact Harvest, and The Cole Protocol, these books are really all over the place in terms of chronology. For instance Broken Circle takes place over a period of three thousand years until it ends up post-Halo 3. So, not really true to chronology. And the Cole Protocol sets you up with characters that you would find better to meet in Fall of Reach.  tl;dr: 1. Fall of Reach, 2. Flood, 3. First Strike, 4. Ghosts of Onyx, then you can probably read in any order after that."

Crawlers and Watchers kind of fill the gap but they'll never replace them.   It's also neat that they have the same shields that the Elites were originally going to have.   Jackals are cool. I kind of want to see a female and her nest though. I'd like to see how they're treated too since they're matriarchal.
HaloStory,3cxk1i,Zeal0tElite,3,Sat Jul 11 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"I'm quite interested as to where Jackal matriarchy comes from, since canon sources have stated that the average female Jackal is roughly equivalent to the average male in terms of size, body shape, and mass, with the only difference being the quills (or lack thereof) and reproductive organs. This is in contrast to Earth's birds of prey where the female is physically superior to the male, and to humans, Elites, and Brutes, where patriarchy is based on the male being stronger and more aggressive than the female."

I recall one scene in which Chol is interrogating another Kig-Yar, and when she's done, she tells him something along the lines of ""you don't have to sell your grandmother to some human pervert"". Was it just an offhand racist remark or is that an actual thing now, considering that humans and Jackals have peacefully coexisted on multiple occasions?"
HaloStory,3cwn2y,Metagenic,4,Sat Jul 11 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not I had the same shower-thought; several times. Over and over. The Kig-Yar portions of that book are absolutely riddled with her familiarity with human expressions and Chol's thoughts on their methods. If I had to make an absolute guess as to what she meant by that phrase, I would guess that humans were seen as perverse, rather than basing it on an actual account of Kig-Yar pound-town. Also, IIRC Chol mentions while she is interrogating said Kig-Yar that torture is a ""substitute for intelligent discussion"" for the Sangheili and a ""hobby"" for the humans."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,S0urMonkey,4,Sun Jul 12 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"I hope that quote was just an insult and not an actual anecdote. The implications...  And yeah, I found the torture part interesting. Considering that Kig-Yar have claws and teeth, and have been known to eat sapient beings, I would have expected them to be a tad bit more enthusiastic about torture. As a side note, it was also quite funny how indignant the Kig-Yar in the book were about humans comparing them to chickens/livestock, because a human would have far more reason to fear being eaten by a Kig-Yar than the other way around."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,Metagenic,2,Sun Jul 12 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"I found that part about being human-food interesting as well, and even more so after reading Buck's accounts in New Blood. I can't think of a reason for the Kig-Yar to think that humans would eat them other than being nicknamed ""chickens"" and those chickens practically having their own food group.  As far as the torture or cruelty, I'm not sure where that stereotype came from. It might be just one of those post-war prejudice things. Reth mentioned in The Cole Protocol that he would have been castrated if the Shipmistress found out that he kept the Rubble secret from her. There seems like there is much more natural barbarity in the Kig-Yar lives, even with sex, so I'm sort of grasping at straws here."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,S0urMonkey,2,Sun Jul 12 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was quite hypocritical of the Kig-Yar characters to complain about being compared to food animals by humans when they've had a terrifying history of actually treating humans (and Grunts) like live prey.   I guess Chol's comment about torture was just her projecting her personal views in a fit of racial arrogance, not the general Kig-Yar mindset. I also remember Staffan Sentzke telling the Kilo-5 ODSTs, after he catches them, ""I should give you to the Kig-Yar, I bet you know more about what they do to prisoners better than I do."" Between that comment, Reth's fear of being sentenced to castration, and the descriptions of Jackals ripping people to ribbons in New Blood, I'd find it hard to believe that Kig-Yar would be averse to torture.

HaloStory,3cwn2y,vincemisfit,2,Sat Jul 11 23:31:00 2015 UTC,Well in Mortal Dictata Naomi said that it was a side effect of the augmentations. It would make sense that all Spartan-IIs have acquire this side effect as it reduces a potential weakness in an otherwise perfect weapon. There would be ways to get around such a thing for retired Spartans like Maria like hormone treatment or the likes. Randall/Nightfall is still bullshit.

HaloStory,3cwn2y,vincemisfit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:59:54 2015 UTC,"Right so that was my point. The example of Maria supposedly having a drive to start a family could be helped with sexual drive treatments, but the initial augmentations having an adverse effect on sexual drive in the first place would be desired while they are still in active duty. Blindness and the other risks are different in that they are considered crippling effects, and would want to be reduced where possible, whereas I'm theorizing that they ensured each Spartan-II really did have a suppressed sexual drive by the end of their augmentations. Grouping ""suppressed sexual drive"" under Risks would then just be a formality."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,benhan23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I see where your coming from now....however just keep in mind when arguing your point sex drive was a risk like blindness read page 75 2010 version of Fall of Reach suppressed sex drive is right next to elephantiasis its clearly within the RISK: section of the medical report. Risk doesn't mean it happened it the potentiality for said situation to happen, but either way it's irrelevant because they can still have intellectual attraction."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,vincemisfit,3,Sun Jul 12 00:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah so blindness, elephantiasis, Parkinson's disease, and so on are negative potential side effects that would be aimed to be as low as possible. Suppressed sexual drive, while still labelled under the same ""Risk"" section would actually be a positive, and they would want the Spartans to have that. Keep in mind that these documents were created for Halsey by one of her mentors who had no knowledge of the existence and aims of the Spartan-II program, so in his point of view suppressed sexual drive in humans is also a negative risk. There could be a series of events where the doctors ensured that each Spartan had a suppressed sexual drive through that specific augmentation. The support for suppressed sexual drive being a universal thing for all Spartan-IIs is in Mortal Dictata, like I previously stated."
HaloStory,3cwn2y,benhan23,2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:45 2015 UTC,Any opinions or thoughts beyond the fact that it's listed clearly as only a risk is pure conjecture.....the Mortal Dictata quote you are discussing could only apply to her as it was a risk...it clearly didnt affect Spartan Black one and Otto

If Halsey think they can, they can.  I'd also like to note that a lack of sexual drive has basically nothing to do with the ability to reproduce. So, Randall could have gotten some dick pills and been fine."

I don't think a suppressed sexual drive would affect Fred's ability to produce sperm cells, though. Knowing Halsey, she'd probably even recommend in vitro fertilization or some shit. Also, I'm pretty sure the Spartan-IIIs wouldn't have problems using their stuff because they didn't have thyroid augmentations, though it's possible they could have achieved the same result through other means."

I mean in the terminals it was great for those small bits of lore, but I don't think it's appropriate for an entire series. It basically means we won't be seeing any fast action scenes and if we do, they'll most likely be very awkward (like in the terminals). Even the idle animations during dialogue have an odd, marionette kind of movement.   I know first hand how much of a pain in the ass animation can be, but I also know many great and aspiring animators there are out there who can do better, are willing to work with other animators on a team, and would do so for a lot less than you'd think. I don't know what 343's budget was for this, but a cartoon that includes what is essentially the main character's origin story has the potential to bring in many new fans. I know a lot of people are going to pass it up and miss out on a great story because the animation is, well... cheesy.  I think it's going to be yet another missed opportunity to do something really badass that we can get excited about. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like they're pinching pennies while trying to flood us in with content. I was really excited for this too. Although, I was expecting an animated series, not a motion comic."

HaloStory,3csp5b,YeoBean,8,Fri Jul 10 13:38:30 2015 UTC,"UNSC electromagnetic ground armament is indeed crazy powerful, more so than most plasma weapons.  The Stanchion was a pre-war design dating from 2491, and it was extremely formidable, but it's not exactly man-portable and needs external power from a fixed source or vehicle. It's more like a turret weapon than it is like a BR. See: https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/universe/weapons/railgun  Then we have the Gauss Hog, the boss Hog, which wrecks everything with its M68 ALIM: http://www.halopedia.org/M68_Asynchronous_Linear-Induction_Motor  Again, not man-portable, it actually is a turret.  And then finally, we have this: https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/universe/weapons/railgun  One-shots anything short of a Knight Battlewagon (which is left on death's door), if you trust gameplay.    As for the gas-operated infantry weapons, the UNSC snipers have at least always been depicted across media to be on par with Covenant beam rifles, although heavier and louder, but logistically simpler as they can be reloaded. The only other direct comparisons can be UNSC ARs and the various automatic plasma weapons (Plasma Rifle, Repeater, Storm Rifle), where the main disadvantage of the ballistics is that they are deflected more easily by energy shields. The UNSC pistol and the plasma pistol are too inconsistent across depictions to make any sort of reliable interpretations of actual canonical performance though.  An interesting point to note though is that the Covenant's precision rifles (the Needle Rifle and Carbine) are ballistic weapons, not plasma. And the Beam Rifle too is a particle accelerator, closer in kin to a railgun than to a plasma pistol. The Forerunner's hardlight weapons also operated as ballistics, but using exotic light mass in place of metal bullets. See: https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/universe/weapons/light-rifle  And finally, the plasma pistol was reverse-engineered from a Forerunner tool of 'indeterminate function', not a weapon. The Covenant has incredibly advanced reactors and batteries, so they're able to power their plasma weapons into formidable tools of destruction, but they're hardly efficient. That kind of power in an electromagnetic ballistic launcher would be truly spectacular."
HaloStory,3csp5b,Skrimyt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:45 2015 UTC,so you're saying that most human ground weapons (even of 2557) can't canonically be as strong as the plasma weapons because they still use the mechanisms as the older versions which were obviously inferior? (just clarifying)
HaloStory,3csp5b,Skrimyt,3,Fri Jul 10 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'm actually saying they're about par, or at least the gas-operated conventional weapons are (as of 2550s) about par. The electromagnetic weapons are better than plasma weapons. And also pointing out that Covenant weaponry for that matter isn't entirely plasma."

Later, in the same book, Dadab shuts down Tartarus's power armor with a single charged plasma pistol shot."

HaloStory,3csp5b,TomShoe,6,Fri Jul 10 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"I don't recall human ballistic weapons performing much better in books set in the 2550s than the ones in Contact Harvest. Palmer has super overpowered magnums in Halo 4's Spartan Ops cutscenes, but the canonical status of those is debatable."
HaloStory,3csp5b,Metagenic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:38:26 2015 UTC,Still not the context i'm stating. (Sorry I should have been more clear) I'm talking about after the war when the UNSC has all the covenant tech to learn from and the huragok to help them advance shit. It's only then when they have a big upgrade in space tech. They do WELL with their OWN (now extremely upgraded) tech in space. They don't just copy plasma weapons from the covenant. Thus i'm suggesting that the same thing has happened on the ground and that conventional weapons are amped to the point of being equal to non-conventional plasma weaponry
HaloStory,3csp5b,TomShoe,3,Fri Jul 10 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"The Huragok clearly haven't had access to the UNSC's handheld weapons yet, otherwise the UNSC wouldn't even need to be using ballistic guns anymore. Also, the MAC cannons are magnetic railguns instead of gunpowder/gas-operated guns, and the UNSC did develop a handheld railgun. It pretty much one hit kills everything."
HaloStory,3csp5b,FlatTire2005,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"Well pretty much everyone uses super overpowered magnums in CE, so there's precedent for some pretty powerful ballistic weaponry."

If the UNSC can outfit their fleet with amped-up human tech and go toe to toe with covie plasma, why not their ground weapons by the time of halo 4?"
HaloStory,3csp5b,FlatTire2005,6,Fri Jul 10 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"They're using the same models of weapons though. They don't have different designations.  In the books, they're weaker than they are in the games. In the games, well, you know. In the movies/shows, they're generally more powerful. It's kind of inconsistent."
HaloStory,3csp5b,Dekar2401,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"the models are different.  Wait you mean in the CURRENT books or the current era, the human guns are still worse? then my argument falls apart I guess. Was just pushing a possibility to see how feasible it was"
HaloStory,3csp5b,TomShoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"There are (I think) four different assault rifles in the games, and they are more or less all the same in terms of power. Number of bullets to wipe out shields are similar. Same with battle rifles, shotguns, sniper rifle but I think they had less variants. Magnum was way more powerful in the first game than in the others though, but still weaker than a charged plasma pistol shot. And yes, in the current era of 2558-2559 they are still using these same models.  Edit: also want to add that in terms of force, human weapons seem to be similar to modern day weapons. That is FORCE ONLY, in Halo the weapons are much more reliable (never jamming, perhaps not needing to be cleaned, perhaps more durable). In real life you cannot shoot magazine after magazine out of an M4 without it jamming. Ak47s are reliable for real life though. But in Halo they never jam but seem to be roughly as powerful as 2015 guns."
HaloStory,3csp5b,dr-pavel,4,Fri Jul 10 15:13:53 2015 UTC,I've shot an ass ton of blank rounds out of an M16 without it jamming in short succession. Blanks have a greater tendency to not cycle the weapon due to less back-pressure and greater buildup of crud than regular ball ammunition. The M4/M16 weapons are a hell of a lot more reliable these days than people give them credit for.
HaloStory,3csp5b,Grandmaofhurt,2,Fri Jul 10 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"The rounds would also be more powerful, the calibres are bigger than  what we have now and there are also 5 centuries of improvement into  ballistic and gun powder technology."
HaloStory,3csp5b,Purdaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Well thats weird. In my experience, blank rounds cause more jamming.  Edit: misread, seems we agree on the blanks. I have only had my weapon jam a few times; Ive seen others jam a lot though. And for full disclosure, Ive never fired an AK47 myself, just seen comparison tests on Deadliest Warrior, history channel, yadda yadda"
HaloStory,3csp5b,Purdaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:08:20 2015 UTC,Of course... it was a four day field exercise and I got like 4 hours of sleep the whole time... so maybe it jammed far more than I remember. I did think another Soldier was a ghost at one point...
HaloStory,3csqbn,Big_Mike_and_da_bois,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:06 2015 UTC,Will took a point blank fuel rod blast. Kurt only got hit by the Hunter's shield.

HaloStory,3csqbn,benhan23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:18 2015 UTC,When did Fred get hit? I can't find that part in the book.
HaloStory,3csqbn,Metagenic,2,Sat Jul 11 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"Chapter 33, I think.   One Hunter eased its fuel-rod cannon around the edge of its impenetrable shields -- green energized rounds glowing with deadly radiation -- and fired. Fred jumped from cover, his MJOLNIR armor ablaze as if it was burning phosphorus. The Hunter hit him dead center in his chest, a blast that would have destroyed their dropship. His energy shields flared brighter, failed, and Fred crumpled to the floor, his armor smoking.   He survived that."
HaloStory,3csqbn,benhan23,2,Sat Jul 11 06:21:28 2015 UTC,"Found it, thanks. It does seem funny but I'd speculate that Fred had full shields when he got hit, whereas Will lost part of his in his skirmish with the two Hunters."
HaloStory,3csqbn,Metagenic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"That explanation would make sense. I'm also guessing that Fred survived and Will didn't because there are two variants of Hunter, one with a one-shot fuel rod launcher and one with a Scarab-esque plasma stream cannon. If that applies to those scenarios, then Fred would have ""only"" taken an explosion -- still hurts, of course -- but Will would have suffered the good part of a continuous wave of plasma. The book did say that his entire front body was melted by the time he dropped dead."
HaloStory,3csqbn,benhan23,2,Sat Jul 11 06:43:06 2015 UTC,"That could also be an explanation, but as the Hunter that shot Fred was specified to have a Fuel-rod Cannon (vs the Assault Cannon that I assume you're talking about), and the one that shot Will was only noted to have a ""cannon"", I'd think that the natural assumption would be that they're carrying the same weapon. Another thing is that Will was hit point-blank, whereas Fred had the benefit of some distance. It hasn't been clear what effect distance plays on plasma weapons, but my guess is that ambient air in atmosphere would play at least some part in the amount of damage it delivers on impact.  On a side note, if Kurt hadn't been incapacitated by one of the Hunter due to his decision to forgo wearing his MJOLNIR armour, would Will have had to sacrifice himself in order to save him? It's bothered me for some time that Kurt used the inferior armour when they were so close to the finish line. I understand his explanation that the Spartan-IIIs morale would be bolstered by his decision, but in reality he was never a Spartan-III, and his entire time spent training Spartan-IIIs didn't make him closer to one. He was always an authority figure to them, so re-establishing himself as a Spartan-II would change nothing, except that he'd be much more effective in combat."

I'd like to know, but I guess it's just a small nitpicky detail so let's leave it at that. I don't know about distance, though, it is a fuel rod gun after all.   I guess Kurt wasn't rationally thinking at the point he decided to forsake MJOLNIR for SPI and onwards. The deaths of so many Spartan-IIIs -- the kids he trained and took care of -- broke him at his foundation. He just did a very good job of hiding it because he was a Spartan and he had more immediate issues, such as fighting thousands of Covies, to focus on.   Deep down, he couldn't cope with the fact that he didn't have enough time or resources to protect more of the S-IIIs during the suicide missions they'd been condemned to, so he started resorting to drastic measures, like illegally drugging Gamma Company with chemicals that would induce animal instinct. I think he felt that he would feel even more guilty if he gave himself more of a chance of survival by wearing MJOLNIR, so he wore SPI instead, so he could at least assure himself that he wasn't allowing himself unfair privileges, and then rationalized it by thinking he just wanted to boost their morale.   Not a very logical decision, of course."

The 'last line of defense' needs to be able to defend what it proposes to defend. It exists for a situation where all other 'lines of defense' have been breached.

There are also, of course, many instances of UNSC soldiers using covenant weapons, probably most notably in the pre-release and contextual materials of halo 3, which had many statements, quotes and anecdotes from UNSC personal in regards to covenant gear.

The Infinity is a perfect example.  Their infantry had great gear and I believe at one point it was stated that their tactics are the ground were superior to the covies?

HaloStory,3cpcxg,Dekar2401,3,Thu Jul 9 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, their current gear is adequate, but plasma weaponry would offer a significant boost to the combat capability of the UNSC military. They're already constantly refitting their forces with new variations of ballistic weaponry so I don't imagine the logistics would be that much of a hassle. The main obstacle would be the cost of setting up manufacturing, but really, that shouldn't be that much of an issue considering the resources the UNSC is spending on churning out new ships.  Despite there not being an official war the UNSC is still taking part in many conflicts against forces with superior technology, such as the Prometheans. There is plenty of motivation to upgrade.  Not sure by what you mean by especially against the Flood. Plasma weaponry is way more effective against the Flood than ballistics according to canon (unfortunately this is not portrayed in gameplay)."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,atfsix,5,Thu Jul 9 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"What more could they do with their ballistic weapons? They shoot large, high power rounds with just enough recoil to handle. Their weapons rarely jam and have long-lasting and reliable electronics suites.   The UNSC can't manufacture reliable plasma weaponry on the scale required for mass deployment, they would require retraining and wouldn't be nearly as proven and reliable as ballistic weapons. The difference wouldn't be worth the cost, which would be disastrous since the UNSC budget was already pushed to its absolute limits during the war.  If plasma weapons were that much more effective than ballistic weapons Marines would be scrambling to get their hands on Covenant weapons during planetary invasions.  The UNSC did use energy weapons throughout the war, the Railgun and Stanchion are great examples of that but never saw mass deployment because they weren't as reliable or cheap as equally effective ballistic weapons."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,deadlylemons,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:01:22 2015 UTC,Another concern I would have is sustainability along with accuracy of plasma weaponry.   This is a unsc who may be fighting in space or in captured delicate structures a stray bullet may be less likely (and less damaging) that a stray plasma shot. I know some plasma can track but not all of it.   The use of precision weaponry to kill targets over weapons of terror (however effective) should be superior. Another universe like Stargates is a fair example of this with taurin and jaffa weapons.
HaloStory,3cpcxg,deadlylemons,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"Accuracy is a fair concern - I think it would be really neat to see the UNSC use the magnetic containment technology of Covenant plasma weapons to make more advanced railguns to replace gas-operated small arms. I suppose Halo 4's railgun could be seen as a first step towards this, but it is still a cubersome weapon with limited utility."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,Jakob535,2,Fri Jul 10 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"It could be a great way to advance human tech over the future games, maybe start with a refinement of the rail gun by redesigning the sniper.   Now I know it's an iconic weapon but integrate a rail gun using covenant/forerunner tech into a slimmer rifle and allow it to fire faster slugs more reliably. It wouldn't have an impact on gameplay and essentially be cosmetic but would show humanity advancing by phasing out older weapons.   By doing it this way you could keep the old sniper as well and have it seen in the hands of normal infantry.

The only UNSC energy weapons as far as I can recall is the Spartan Laser and the Rhino artillery cannon. UNSC troops did not scramble for Covenant weapons all the time in battle, no. But there are plenty of possible reasons - Covenant weapons are impractical for humans to use due to their shape and readouts being in alien language, they have limited batteries that the UNSC has no means of replacing, and UNSC troops presumably doesn't have much training in their use. I'm talking about post-war UNSC mainly - they clearly have a wealth of resources sine they are able to churn out new ships constantly, and are able to field a large contingent of Spartan-IVs equipped with extremely advanced armor - it just seems weaponry hasn't been able to keep up."

HaloStory,3cpcxg,Master_Chief_71,6,Thu Jul 9 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably. And that really sucks. Gameplay shouldn't take precedent to the point where the world no longer makes sense.   If they really put some effort into it they could make human energy weapons that are distinct from the Covenant ones, and maybe even some hybrids. Maybe UNSC plasma weapons would be more beam-style, like what Cortana did with the Ascendant Justice's plasma cannons. And for hybrid weapons, stuff like a Battle Rifle with an underslung plasma weapon for overloading shields.  EDIT: Hell, even having the UNSC use the technology of plasma weapons to create their own stuff, like wider implementation of handheld railgun weaponry thanks to the magnetic technology used to contain the plasma. Halo 4 obviously does have the railgun which is a small step in that direction but it is a highly specialized weapon - railgun assault rifles, snipers etc would be nice to see instead of the same gas-driven crap the UNSC has been using for ages."

HaloStory,3cpcxg,TomShoe,2,Thu Jul 9 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but the way your comment was worded made it sound like marines never had trouble fighting elites, when that isn't the case.  In fact marines rarely won, all the time.  There are exceptions, like Buck and Alpha Nine or Johnson, but your average marine will not be able to defeat an Elite singlehandedly.  It usually takes a 4-5 man squad of marines to take down a single Elite.    The reason we were ""more effective"" on the ground was due to a majority of Covenant ground forces were made up of Grunts, who, without Elites, were very disorganized whereas our marines were tactical and efficient.  Usually the Marines would focus fire on the Elite to take him down quickly, then pick off the straggling Grunts or Jackals in the chaos of the Elites death.  This is why we fared better in ground engagements."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,TomShoe,3,Thu Jul 9 21:41:45 2015 UTC,Huh? Where are you getting that from? Marines do in no way have an easy time dealing with elites.

HaloStory,3cpcxg,Skrimyt,2,Thu Jul 9 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"The UNSC was able to hold their own on the ground thanks to superior tactica, home advantage, and Spartans, not equipment.  Most canon sources have a single marine being quite outmatched against a single elite, but a squad could focus-fire them down of course.

HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Well we don't have power ratings for these plasma weapons, they could be very low powered, easily dissipating plasma bolts, like only able to burn through thin aluminum  sheet metal unless continuously fired like a plasma welder or something.   If we able to compare the energy levels for plasma weaponry then we could do analysis on the pros and cons of ballistic weaponries kinetic energy damage versus the plasma bolt energy levels, but until we know specifics I don't think we can say they are far more devastating."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"We know that plasma weapons fire literally melts away rock, I'd say that's a good indicator. We also know that it overloads shields more effectively, and against unarmored flesh it is extremely dangerous."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't seem to have anything like the range or accuracy ballistic weapons do, and gives away the position of the operator. It may be more powerful, but you give up some in the way of flexibility. That's why real life armies don't issue service rifles chambered in .50 BMG.   Why bother developing lasers and such when a person shot with a plasma bolt is going to be no more dead than one who takes a few 7.62mm slugs? Plasma weaponry certainly has its advantages over conventional weaponry, but it also has it's disadvantages. Perhaps the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, but at the end of the day, is it really by enough to warrant the cost? Probably not. What it comes down to is that one isn't necessarily better than the other, they're just different.   The way the covenant wages war is radically different than the way humanity wages war, as is to be expected from an alien race. The difference is that human weaponry evolved to meet the demands of human warfare, while the opposite is true of the covenant, among whom warfare evolved to reflect the technology they reverse engineered from forerunner artifacts. Indeed, the very conflict that led to the formation of the Covenant, the Sangheili-San Shyum war was literally was defined by — and decided by — the issue of this weaponry. Humanity never had that same sort of outside influence on how it waged war, and so waged war differently. Is one necessarily better or worse? Clearly not by enough to make a difference in the end, as humanity won most of the ground battles between the two."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"The whole ""just as dead"" argument is ridiculous. Infantry in the Halo universes employs body armor and various types of energy shielding that needs to be penetrated before someone dies. Plasma weaponry is better at this than ballistics.  Accuracy and range is a concern with the Covenant's standard plasma weapons, yes, at least on an infantry level. That doesn't mean the UNSC can't use Covenant tech to field improved weaponry - Plasma beam weaponry like the focus rifle, more lasers, railguns, coilguns, hybrid weaponry. There's lots of things that could be done."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,VictoriousRaptor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the designs covenants actual plasma weapons are pretty much all hundreds of years old. The Plasma Pistol is based on a Forerunner tool of ""indeterminate function"" that likely wasn't even a weapon (since when have we known the forerunner to use plasma weaponry?), while the plasma rifle is basically the elite equivalent of a sword; the pattern goes back centuries, and no to are really alike, but one made now isn't going to be significantly different from one made centuries ago. These weapons are still the bread and butter of the covenant, and when we imagine their way of war, we imagine it being up close and personal, based on the use of these weapons by massed infantry supported by more powerful armored infantry. Clearly that way of fighting was built around the kinds of weapons the covenant used for most of it's history.  On the other hand, more modern weaponry like the carbine tends to rely on much more familiar technology, but more significantly, to play much more familiar roles. The nearest analogs to the plasma pistols and rifles (and it's not really all that near) are pistols and submachine guns, neither of which tend to be issued as the primary service weapon of human militaries. But the carbine, the beam rifle, and more recent iterations of the plasma rifle design like the repeater and the storm rifle all seem to mimic much more directly the sort of categories human weaponry tends to fall into, the reason likely being that these newer weapons were developed in response to the tactics used by UNSC forces — which we know are generally superior — the needs of which their weapons are designed to meet.   Technologically too, these weapons are not necessarily that far ahead of anything the UNSC could build. The carbine is basically just a standard ballistic weapon, with radioactive rounds. That would be easy enough to reproduce, but there's no real reason to bother with it when normal rounds do the job and are a lot easier to manufacture and a lot safer for troops. The various beam rifle designs are particle accelerators, which is a piece of technology that we currently have now, albeit not in handheld form. It's worth noting though that currently our particle accelerators are not being developed as weapons, whereas we are developing railguns, which are vaguely similar in principle, but evidently much more practical weapons."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,Diablo_Cow,2,Sun Jul 12 13:49:34 2015 UTC,The UNSC never lost because of their projectile weapons.
HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:05:11 2015 UTC,We have no way of knowing that. And they most certainly lost more troops than they would have if they had been equipped with advanced weaponry.
HaloStory,3cpcxg,Diablo_Cow,3,Fri Jul 10 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Ballistic weapons are tremendously more efficient than plasma weapons. If you can dump X energy into a weapon, dumping it into a railgun will produce vastly superior results than dumping it into a glorified hot gas spewer. The only reason the Covenant had powerful weapons is because the input energies they could harness were VASTLY greater than that of human technology, especially in space battles.  This is the reason why railguns are a significant topic of actual military research in reality too. Ballistics work. Ballistics are efficient. The energy you're spending to take the kill to the enemy is also the energy that will kill them.  Yes, the UNSC also has developed energy weapons projects, and if anything energy weapons in the Halo-verse have an exceptional role due to the kinetic-deflecting properties of energy shields (which have no real-world analogue or legitimately explainable mechanism). But I don't see a good reason why they should make a mass tech switch to a crappier concept, on top of the R&D and logistical issues that would be involved in such a process.  Also, Forerunner weapons themselves are ballistic, they just use exotic matter (hard light). Things like the Light Rifle actually do kinetic damage. The Forerunners, who developed their technology through iterative innovation, like the modern humans, also used ballistics. And explosives - the Binary Rifle and Incinerator utilize antimatter to achieve their destructive qualities. But they do not do the absurdly inefficient process of ionizing, heating, containing and slowly projecting plasma.  TL;DR, screw plasma, just put more power into kinetics.  And Edit: Overall, I just don't buy the entire ""plasma is awesome"" shtick. Plasma isn't fucking magic, and it's a terrible thing to make weapons out of. The Covenant just had obscene amounts of energy to work with. When you're that far ahead on power generation, you can do whatever the heck you want and have an advantage. Every time I hear Halo fans wax anvilicious about the Covenant's superior plasma weaponry and how the UNSC should adopt it, it just makes my engineering mind cringe."
HaloStory,3cpcxg,FlatTire2005,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, fair enough, plasma weapons may not be more efficent, but they are more powerful than ballistic weaponry. I think it would be great to see the UNSC build more advanced railguns and coilguns to replace their gas-operated weapons. This would offer more powerful weaponry without plasma. Most Forerunner weapons are directed energy weapons. Both hardlight (Lightrifle, Suppressor, Enforcer Weapons) and particle beams (Sentinel Beams) count as DEWs."

They're an enemy that could very easily be used to generate a survival horror style Halo game a la Dead Space or the Halo novel The Mona Lisa.  I like their back story and how they link to the Precursors. How can they all work together without any obvious means of communication? Neural Physics! Which shows their Precursor origins.

That being said, it's a shame Bungie was never able to really nail down how they wanted the Flood to work in gameplay- I'd say that Flood levels have, without exception, the worst replay value out of all the levels by an enormous margin. I don't think in the 10 years that I've been playing Halo games that I've ever loaded up a one-off flood level to play, the way I'll load up, say, The Storm or Assault on the Control Room.

I was always more fascinated with the Human-Covenant War for what it is and the plots that have been created from the war's beginnings to its ends.  The Flood always felt like a cope out to me to introduce an enemy that suffers imo from DBZ syndrome (a new enemy must be way more powerful than the last).    Because I feel that the Flood and to an extent the Promeathans suffer from DBZ syndrome, I've enjoyed any Halo game without either without them than a Halo game that includes them."

In Halo 2, Rtas Vadum, the shipmaster says I know that stench! We then walk into a room with infections forms safely locked away, as soon as we turn the corner, they all come for us!

After having read them and then watching these videos, I can say as someone who doesn't enjoy comic books, that these videos touch on all of the important points.  Just keep watching them until ""The Next 72 Hours"" story arc is finished."

HaloStory,3cntle,cat_like_thief_,5,Fri Jul 10 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give a more detailed summary of other events than the master chief, since that's already been covered. While these events aren't all technically dated between halo 4 and 5, the source material that covers them came between the two, so  people may not be familiar with them:  Spoilers all round, obviously  Fire Team Osiris  Jameson Locke: In Halo Nightfall, Locke is an ONI agent who travels to a drifting section of the Alpha Halo with his ONI team and a group of colony militia. The mission goes bad and Locke is left trying to save the survivors from the predations of his ONI teammates. He discovers that one of the militia is a former spartan, and is profoundly impressed with his heroism and honor, thus (probably) deciding to become a spartan 4. At the same time he becomes disillusioned with ONI, and is probably not well disposed to people going off on their own private missions - which may explain why he is so frequently cast as being 'against' the master chief  Holly Tanaka: A survivor from a glassed colony world. She watched her group of survivors turn against each other and had to leave her father to die. One tough cookie - covered in Halo Escalation 16-17  Edward Buck  A lot happened since ODST, and you can read about it in Halo Bloodline. The Rookie was killed fighting Insurrectionists, and Buck was partly convinced by Dare to become a Spartan 4, along with Mickey and Dutch. Mickey turned traitor, but was captured by Buck. He ends Bloodline saying he has had enough leading a team and just wants to follow from now on.   Olympia Vale - One of the main character from Hunters in the Dark. She's a scientist but quite strong and definitely spartan material. She's an expert on the Sangheili (speaks the language) and develops a strong relationship with Usze and N'tho (good friends of the Arbiter). She travels with some elites and scientists to the Ark, where they encounter 000 Tragic Solitude. Solitude is pissed the Ark got damaged, and wants to use every piece of matter in the solar system to rebuild it. Also it hates humans, and wants to trigger the Halo Array again. Vale and two other spartan 4s manage to kill it, and at some point after that Vale becomes a spartan 4  Others  Jul Mdama and Halsey These two discovered the Janus Key from Requiem and were finally able to unite them in Halo Escalation. This gave them a holographic record of the location of the Absolute Record (a map of all forerunner tech in the galaxy, though probably not the Organon)  UNSC Spirit of Fire Missing since Halo Wars, this ship was shown in Escalation to be contaminated with Flood, and will probably be the vector for their return into the story (though definitely not in Halo 5)  UNSC Rubicon In case you haven't read the forerunner trilogy, 343 guilty spark survived Halo 3's ending, commandeered this ship and shot off into space somewhere, claiming that the librarian is still alive and he knows where to find her.   Let me know if i missed anything."
HaloStory,3cntle,Steely_Tulip,2,Thu Jul 9 17:03:31 2015 UTC,"UNSC Spirit of Fire Missing since Halo Wars, this ship was shown in Escalation to be contaminated with Flood, and will probably be the vector for their return into the story (though definitely not in Halo 5)   No :( Do we know if all hands were lost? Have the Flood assumed control of the entire crew?"
HaloStory,3cntle,herdiegerdie,4,Thu Jul 9 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"All we get is a panel shot of the interior of the ship, and an infection form running across the foreground"
HaloStory,3cntle,Steely_Tulip,3,Thu Jul 9 19:06:46 2015 UTC,We don't know. We only saw a panel of a single Flood Infection Form aboard it.
HaloStory,3cntle,Dekar2401,4,Thu Jul 9 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"This is troubling. However, it does set up for an interesting return of the Flood since there was a team of Spartan IIs on board. I think some of the crew might make it out okay because of the Spartans."
HaloStory,3cntle,herdiegerdie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"Technically Spark doesn't say the Librarian. He says the Lifeshaper. The Librarian had also held that title, but she transferred it to Chant-to-Green before the firing of the Halo array. Chant-to-Green also survived the firing so it stands to reason he probably meant her."
HaloStory,3cntle,Petey7,2,Sat Jul 11 09:56:24 2015 UTC,As a followup to this:  What books or other material have come out that take place after Halo 4?
HaloStory,3cntle,WeaponsMaster9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:46 2015 UTC,It will be explained in the game. Nobody knows why John goes AWOL. It hasn't been revealed anywhere.
HaloStory,3cntle,TheEld,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:00:30 2015 UTC,Yeah it has. Escalation comics cover it pretty well.
HaloStory,3cntle,cat_like_thief_,4,Thu Jul 9 15:23:41 2015 UTC,That isn't true whatsoever. The last time we saw him in Escalation it was July of '57. By March of 2558 he still hasn't gone AWOL yet.
HaloStory,3cntle,TheEld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:26:01 2015 UTC,The start of him going AWOL is when Hood tells him to take it easy and he disobeys while also lying to blue team about their orders.   That's AWOL in my opinion.  Sure we don't know his exact reason (it's obviously about the librarian and chief doing his part to save the Galaxy) but we do know why he originally left and went AWOL thanks to escalation.  Do you have anything to back up your argument other than just saying I'm wrong?
HaloStory,3cntle,cat_like_thief_,4,Thu Jul 9 15:34:45 2015 UTC,"According to GameInformer, Blue Team is dispatched to investigate the UNSC Argent Moon in March of 2558. It isn't until John sees Cortana that he and his team abandon what they were doing and go AWOL."
HaloStory,3cntle,TheEld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Then how do you explain the two marines at the end of one of the escalation comics talking about how Hood is freaking out over Chief going AWOL? Those are he exact words used after all.  Once again, I'll give you that we are missing some time between the moments I'm talking about within escalation and where halo 5 will pick up. That being said, he still went AWOL during escalation and hasn't been picked up by the UNSC since then.  He's been running missions sure but none that have been sanctioned by the UNSC.  Shit in the Hunt The Truth podcast we were lead to believe Chief helped with an attack on a summit meeting.  I guess what I'm getting at is sure maybe his reasons for staying AWOL have changed but he almost certainly has been covered going AWOL in escalation. that was the end of his story arc in the comics after all"
HaloStory,3cntle,cat_like_thief_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"You might need to read that issue again. And Ben's investigation started around March 29th, after Halo 5' story begins."
HaloStory,3cntle,TheEld,2,Thu Jul 9 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that date from, out to curiosity?"
HaloStory,3cntle,Defguru,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:58:17 2015 UTC,What do you have to say about the marines conversing about him going AWOL after disobeying Hood?  Would not make sense at all for Chief to go AWOL after the 72 hours only to have him come back and not have that scene covered in any media.  I get that the timelines don't exactly add up but there's nothing in the media to believe he came back after initially going AWOL.   That conversation with the marines would serve no purpose.  I can assure you I don't need to re-read it.
HaloStory,3cmxth,Ave3ng3d7X,30,Thu Jul 9 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"My favorite Chipps Dubbo theory is that he is the result of a failed (I guess abandoned would be a better term) cloning experiment. It would be great if that was actually made canon in a non-cheesy way.   I was replaying CE today and noticed he is the Marine manning the Warthog's gun that Echo 419 drops off for you on the level Halo. I thought this was pretty cool as this is the first we see of him, unless he's on Pillar of Autumn and I just don't remember.   I'm also sticking to the theory that Dubbo escaped installation 04 with the help of Dustin Echos."
HaloStory,3cmxth,Purdaddy,30,Thu Jul 9 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"He's actually the first marine on the PoA to talk to you. ""Sir, captain needs us on the bridge, ASAP. Better follow me."""

HaloStory,3cmxth,Zman6258,4,Thu Jul 9 06:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well, there has been cases where the flash clones created to replace the children abducted by the S2 program have actually survived and lived full lives.  Perhaps there is an original Chips Dubbo with a different name who was a candidate for the S2 program and his clone survived, grew old enough and joined the UNSC.  ONI might have noticed the clone survived and so in an attempt to clean up any evidence without raising suspicion, assigned the clone to 'suicide missions' such as the battle of Installations 05 and 00, hoping that he would die and the truth would be literally buried.  As for the original Chips Dubbo, he might have 'washed out' of S2 training so ONI decided to wipe his memory, give him false memories of his home planet then enlist him as a marine in order to 'keep their assets close'."
HaloStory,3cmxth,Trinitykill,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:50 2015 UTC,That'd be a good tie in! It'd be even funnier if he wasn't Australian. They just added the accent after the brain wipe for giggles.

HaloStory,3cmxth,HeyLudaYouLikeToEat,3,Thu Jul 9 06:30:53 2015 UTC,I like to think that he has an identical twin. That's who we saw in New Mombasa.  Or hell maybe it's just some other Aussie guy.

HaloStory,3cmxth,youcardfolder,16,Thu Jul 9 06:05:08 2015 UTC,No more Spartan-IVs please. Since Johnson died and Buck's squad became Spartans we've had zero significant Marine characters in the story.

HaloStory,3cmxth,monk1junk1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:05:49 2015 UTC,I prefer Stacker than Dubbo. He's been in every game and battle except Halo Wars
HaloStory,3cp2ae,vincemisfit,4,Thu Jul 9 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"I think I liked the book a lot more than you, though there were certain plot elements that could have been better.  As for Spartan-II-focused lore, Last Light should handle that when it comes out."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,Defguru,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:01 2015 UTC,I'm excited for Last Light but still in the camp that 343 should slow down a bit when it comes to expanding the lore.
HaloStory,3cp2ae,Defguru,4,Thu Jul 9 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"I think their pace is fine. There are plenty of nooks and crannies that can be filled in, and new threads are always likely to emerge after every main game."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,monk1junk1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:11 2015 UTC,I think they need the expand more and progress less. They need to stop moving forward in technological advances ect. before we end up with some dragon ball z level escalation shit here. What they need to do is branch out and fill the holes we have now.
HaloStory,3cp2ae,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Jul 10 05:17:53 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but I thought New Blood was better. New Blood had complicated philosophical and moral questions regarding the Innsurrectionists, how the humans see the Covenant now and vice versa, friendships dying, backstory being told about the Rookie, and Buck's transformation into the Spartan we'll see in Halo 5.   Hunters in the Dark I enjoyed the Tragic Solitude's tragic history, but I wish they'd mentioned Mendicant Bias and more about 343 Guilty Spark.  I really liked Olympia and the two Elites were my fave characters."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,Defguru,2,Thu Jul 9 20:23:53 2015 UTC,It was a huge missed opportunity to not even mention Mendicant.
HaloStory,3cp2ae,dragotx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'm betting they plan on bringing Mendicant in, but what they have set up for him precludes using him in anything earlier to avoid any unneccesary plot holes.  I fully expect to finally meet him in 5, or at least have him come out more into the open rather than banised to terminals that most players will never see."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,tblots4,2,Fri Jul 10 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"I thought the book was very poor. Very cliched story that didn't really add to the universe, which is quite the thing when you consider they went to the Ark. And yes, I thought the writing was pretty average and many character motivations were forced, like they were given in single monologues or quick conversations that don't leave a lasting impression.  For me, this is probably my least favourite Halo novel, or at least tied with Mortal Dictata. But that's ok, I mean there are people who liked the Kilo-5 trilogy and disliked the Forerunner trilogy ... and in the end, they're just books."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,DrummerBoy2999,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, at the end of the day its a halo book which IMO is better then the standard book."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,OozyGorilla,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"Something I loved about this book that I really want in games is the life, we almost had floating whales in Halo 4! I honestly really enjoyed reading about the creatures such as the giant tree, which was certainly interesting."
HaloStory,3cp2ae,obiwan117,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:00:33 2015 UTC,"My main issue with the book is it seemed the entire middle of the book was too long on too little. Spoiler Warning Other than that, I enjoyed the book. Any time we get main Sangheili character is a good story to me. Can't get enough of them, especially when interacting with Humans."
HaloStory,3cnbab,TheEld,10,Thu Jul 9 06:07:34 2015 UTC,"In 2557, Thomas Lasky made absolutely no mention of Zeta Halo to John-117 when speaking of the Infinity's work with Halo rings. He said that there were bases on 03 and 05, but 07 was curiously not mentioned, despite the fact that it was discovered in 2555.   Maybe that was just because it wasn't pertinent to the discussion. The Chief already knew about Delta Halo, and he had to mention Gamma Halo because that's how they discovered Requiem's coordinates.  Additionally, it seems as though control of Zeta Halo has fallen to the Swords of Sanghelios. Perhaps this was a political concession, so that humanity didn't control every Halo and to ease tension. If so, that would make sense as to why Zeta Halo is excluded, despite humanity first discovering it.  I don't know. This isn't a solid explanation. Just the only thing I can think of."
HaloStory,3cnbab,Defguru,3,Thu Jul 9 07:50:08 2015 UTC,"I am really not sure. Maybe the missing monitor came back rampant and messed with weather controls and Flood containment. Or an automated subroutine that replaced the monitor malfunctioned having the same effect. It's really tough to say. To be honest, it would be nice to see a fully sane monitor operating at peak capacity for once. The only ones I can think of now are Static Carillion and Enduring Bias (he was broken, but he knew it and was sane otherwise).  Another possibility is one of the civilians released the Flood and they took over in the monitor's absence. They triggered the clouds to stop vision of what was happening below (dunno if that's an actual tactic, with space-radar).  I think it'll be explored in Halo 5, since the name of the game is Halo and we will probably visit a Halo at some point. Since so many hints are being dropped about Installation 07, I think it has to be that one."
HaloStory,3cnbab,tblots4,2,Thu Jul 9 07:01:15 2015 UTC,"Am i the only who can't reconcile the ark hologram with ""cloud cover""? The surface is clearly yellow and most of the fan theories at the time were that the installation was covered in flood biomass. Was that just inattention on the part of 343 - why did they have to choose that halo?  As for why the cloud cover was there in 2555, perhaps the halo has an automatic procedure for hiding its surface in the event the monitor is not present, and clearing it when a reclaimer shows up - thus discouraging other species from wanting to land. Just guessing though"
HaloStory,3cnbab,Steely_Tulip,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:53:44 2015 UTC,"Lasky also makes mention to Chief that they've not had a violent reaction (Promethians) from any other installation in Halo 4, despite running into Promethians on the Arc in 2554."

HaloStory,3cn3h7,Defguru,11,Thu Jul 9 05:17:45 2015 UTC,"I just love how multifaceted everything is. In many ways, Halo is a depressing universe, where external alien threats and even internal strife threaten to tear everything apart. But to me Halo has always been about how even the most insurmountable challenges can be overcome by those willing to face it. It won't be without sacrifice and loss, but you can ensure a better tomorrow for yourself or those you care about. Even the Forerunners' great loss helped pave the way for humanity and the other races to survive and hopefully defeat the Flood where the Forerunners could not.  And that's what I think is the crux of Halo. The dichotomy of good and evil, gain and loss, the saviors and the sacrificed, ends and means, heroes and villains.  It's a galactic stage where even the smallest players can shine and impact the course of the galaxy in some way."

But in a way like most halo fans I grew up with Master Chief. I grew up with reading blue team in the woods fighting DI's.

HaloStory,3cmu43,YeoBean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is a canon choice just a gameplay one. The zealots were suppose to be the most seasoned and most honored and they were given just a sword in combat. The ultras had normal weapons most of the time so that allowed them to fire back at you. Also, I think it was like 5 sniper rifle headshots to kill an ultra. They were just the hardest elite to fight in Halo 2."

They are considered the top elite shock troopers meaning they should be the toughest land bassed elites. Think of them as odst elites, while there battle prowling is great there strategic planning isn't the greatest. You send them into hot zones and they fight their way out.  But they aren't the best to plan/lead the army that's where zealots come in. Its also noted that zealots are the highest ranking so shipmasters are zealots,   the relic pursuing/flood specialist elites from halo 2 had had an zealot leading them.   Generals seen in halo reach are higher rankings zealots. And FieldMarshals are zealots who's tactics are insane their only used in the most critical of battles"
HaloStory,3cmu43,wildedge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:26:27 2015 UTC,Generals might not be higher ranking. Mostly because zealots are portrayed as a special high priority target while generals seem to fit your description of Halo 2 ultras.
HaloStory,3cmu43,YeoBean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:43:40 2015 UTC,If you wiki the general rank it reveals that they are the higher rankings ultras. There job is managing larger scale ground battles. With there ultra background most do so from the front.

HaloStory,3clnei,CalebS92,6,Wed Jul 8 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"The Domain was created by the Precursors roughly 500 million years ago for use as a compendium of all knowledge available to the Precursors. Although a physical Domain is thought to have existed, the Domain generated a massive field across the entire Milky Way from which it could be accessed, though given the isolation of the Path Kethona Forerunner it likely ended at the outer rim. In this way, it's sort of like a grander but centralized Internet, with a massive server storing all data but being accessed by billions of individual end-users from all across the serviceable area.  Eventually, in a time likely before the Forerunner-Precursor War, the Forerunners came to access the Domain. Despite the destruction of the Precursors, the Domain survived due to the neural physics-based architecture on which the Precursors built it. The Forerunners lacked the Precursors' understanding of neural physics, and so were unable to access the Domain mentally, instead relying on their armour, ancillas, dedicated terminals, Cryptums, or Haruspices to reach it, much in the same way people rely on computers or similar devices to reach the Internet.  However, the Domain was unlike the Internet in that regardless of how relevant information may be to one accessing the Domain, data would be buried as more was added to it. Thus, information from one thousand years ago would be more difficult to access than information from three weeks ago, yet easier than information from one million years ago.  Another important aspect of the Domain, central to Forerunner religion, was that it was seen as an afterlife for their people. When accessing the Domain, a Forerunner would leave being part of their essence: an echo of their personality, emotions, etc.. In this sense, it is sort of like a username or comment section, leaving behind only a very slight reflection of the individual's personality and character. However, the Forerunners believed that upon death, their entire essences would be sublimed into the Domain.  Despite all this, the Domain was also an independent entity, capable of thinking for itself. In this sense, it is very much the most powerful artificial intelligence known in the Halo lore, though its inability to communicate except via essence imprints and information release limited recognition of this fact. Similarly, it was known to hide information it felt should be kept secret and felt dread when made aware of its own destruction.  According to the Gravemind, the Domain was destroyed by the activation of the Halo array, which destroyed all neural physics architecture and thusly rendered the Domain & the field it generated null. However, terminals on Requiem would continue to attempt to access it for millennia, caught in a loop due to it being inaccessible. There is some speculation that the Domain, or at least parts of it, survived the Halos' destructive pulse, but so far this theory is unsubstantiated and purely speculation."
HaloStory,3clnei,In_Medias_Res,3,Thu Jul 9 04:40:31 2015 UTC,I feel like the Keymind knew it wouldn't destroy it completely but implied to the Librarian it would because she was such a great enemy of his. The Flood lying is very much in its character.
HaloStory,3clnei,Dekar2401,6,Thu Jul 9 06:02:05 2015 UTC,Yes it is basically psychic internet (or Akashic Records from the Hindu religion).  How the Chief was called to it is unknown right now. Gotta wait for Halo 5.
HaloStory,3clnei,FlatTire2005,4,Wed Jul 8 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"As FlateTire2005 said, it is essentially a database of knowledge that is accessed mentally. In regards to if it is gone, not necessarily. A popular theory I've heard is that the Halos destroyed the means to access it. The Domain may still be together, but any means of accessing it that weren't protected were destroyed in the firing.   Therefore, there may be methods to which it still called to the Chief. Also the Librarian's remnant on Requiem accelerated his evolution so it could be that now he has the genetics necessary to access it. It's an interesting theory and one I hope is true.  EDIT: Also Halo 4 is OG Didact. Bornstellar had no ill will towards the Humans."

I don't want to list all of them or go into too much detail for fear of spoilers, but you're going to be seeing out of the eyes of different catalogs that are taking testimony and uploading to the judiciary network at different points in the story.   On a larger scale, the entire book is supposedly an ONI organized summary of the final days of the forerunners using information from various sources (catalog and the judiciary network, the bornstellar relation, etc...)"
HaloStory,3ckqwz,lurker_343,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer, that does help a lot. However, I've got a few follow-up questions if you don't mind. (I appreciate you not going into spoilers.)  Is there a way to tell which character I'm following each time? Is there hints given or do they outright say so?  I believe the book said the events are chronologically ordered to the best of ONI's ability, but do the events take place relatively during the same time frame, or are they years apart? Is that answered in the book?  The first part of the book, where the Catalog is speaking with the Haruspis, is that before or after the proceeding events?   Sorry for the abundance of questions. I just see that this book is frequently listed as one of, if not the best, book in the Halo universe, and I guess I'm just afraid I'll miss out on stuff or not like it as much if I don't understand it. I guess my real best bet is to just give it more time."
HaloStory,3ckqwz,lurker_343,2,Wed Jul 8 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'll do what I can to help, this book does start off in a strange fashion, and I absolutely, behind Nylund's Trilogy this might be the single best source of Halo lore out there.  So, for starters, at each ""string"" of the book, there will be name in the top margin (Catalog, Librarian, so on...). This is the character who's eyes you are seeing out of for this portion of the book. As I said earlier, there are multiple different catalogs throughout the course of the story, it's not as if it is one guy that is existing multiple places at once. Catalog is different judiciary forerunners that exist together as a collective entity. In that way, a majority of the book is told through the testimony that others give catalog to send to the judiciary network.  This leads to your next question about ordering. This book basically takes place at sometime after the events of Primordium (book two in the forerunner saga). From start to finish, the story follows a pretty straight chronological path, meaning you're not flip flopping forward and backwards uncontrollably, with the exception of one or two major flashbacks. When there is a flashback, you'll be made pretty well aware. Later on in the book, there are several short strings that ""advance time"" so to speak. Near the end you take what seems to be some large time jumps to fill in the gaps before the . Please be aware that the ""endgame"" in this book does not line up perfectly with other sources, namely the terminals of Halo 3. Definitely use the wiki to wrap your head around these inconsistencies.  Finally, the intro to book, as I take it at least, is a catalog reporting everything to the domain after all is said and done, meaning it would take place after the events of the novel.  Hope that helps :)"

HaloStory,3ci5ey,skilledwarman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:35:09 2015 UTC,I mean tech level. Before they nuked themselves into the stone age they were at the same level that humanity was during the war. So I said it would be funny if 343 was like plot twist! Its an ancient brute starship

HaloStory,3ci5ey,BraveExpress2,3,Wed Jul 8 23:24:25 2015 UTC,Where is it said that the flood were encountered on Zeta Halo? In Hunters in the Dark?
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Cabbaggio,2,Wed Jul 8 04:11:46 2015 UTC,See Post #12  http://www.halopedia.org/Catalog/Archive/2014
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Cabbaggio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:23:04 2015 UTC,Huh. I hadn't heard about Catalog until now. Bit confused on what it is.
HaloStory,3ci5ey,T0AStyWombat,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:56 2015 UTC,Catalog is essentially a Forerunner history recording organization. It is made up of a bunch of individuals and AI(?) who's sole purpose is to record other Forerunners' thoughts and events in history. Catalog plays an important part in how the UNSC knows so much about the Forerunners.
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Cabbaggio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:04:01 2015 UTC,And where do these posts come from? 343 people posting on some thread on Waypoint?
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Riceatron,2,Wed Jul 8 18:19:22 2015 UTC,Yep. Catalog is essentially the same concept as Adjutant Reflex on the old Bungie forums. It's a 343 employee that posts canon answers to questions.
HaloStory,3ci5ey,YeoBean,2,Wed Jul 8 22:04:54 2015 UTC,Imagine a halo wars-esque game concurrent with the final (main) game/act where you played as mendicant/offensive bias coordinating everything against the flood
HaloStory,3ci5ey,LeFapMaster95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:33 2015 UTC,If zeta halo had a flood infesration then how were Luther and Henry able to do research on it without being attacked by the flood?
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Kody_Z,2,Wed Jul 8 15:29:27 2015 UTC,I suspect we will find out in Shadow of Intent
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Captain_Kahn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't know when the Flood infestation was discovered. All we know is that as of 2558 the infestation has been relatively contained.   The Flood infestation was most likely discovered after Luther and Henry left Installation 07."
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Kody_Z,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:49:14 2015 UTC,PLOT TWIST! Luther and Henry let the Flood out!
HaloStory,3ci5ey,Captain_Kahn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:35 2015 UTC,Right before leaving the installation they discovered a chamber with flood spores and inadvertently released them. They sealed the room and Henry disabled the door controls and thought it would be contained. Then didn't bother to tell anyone because of the impending threat of Halo firing.

HaloStory,3cjc58,SpartanAB117,30,Wed Jul 8 10:42:13 2015 UTC,"The Halos emit a pulse of energy which destroys the nervous system of anything that has a nervous system, including all sentient life and any Flood form more complex than a supercell. Were Installation 04B fired before the UNSC and Swords of Sanghelios could retreat, it would have killed the Gravemind and the combat forms, in addition to all Humans, Sangheili, and most life on the Ark and Installation 04B. Though the pure forms are made of entirely biomass, they require a direct connection to a Gravemind, attained only during the Coordinated stage. With the Gravemind killed, they would be rendered inert, as the Flood would revert to the Feral stage, leaving only the infection forms and supercells to repopulate. However, both necessitate the existence of a nervous system in their host, and so they would be useless as all of their potential hosts would be dead.  In short, the Flood would be eradicated were the Halo fired, as it would be without the ability to infect hosts or consume biomass."
HaloStory,3cjc58,In_Medias_Res,3,Wed Jul 8 11:47:02 2015 UTC,Appreciate the detailed answer. Thanks!
HaloStory,3cjc58,In_Medias_Res,2,Wed Jul 8 12:13:14 2015 UTC,No problem.
HaloStory,3cjc58,kinngshaun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:55:01 2015 UTC,Awesome answer man. This was actually the one thing that bugged in Hunters in the Dark. Why weren't there any leftover Flood and why were all the multitude of creatures unharmed by the ring?
HaloStory,3cjc58,In_Medias_Res,2,Wed Jul 8 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"It's discussed in the novel that the animals were likely contained to specific regions on the Ark until Installation 04B's activation released them. Given that the Ark was intended to preserve the peoples of the galaxy, it's possible certain regions on the installation had shield world-like protective defences, keeping them alive. It's also possible that creatures like the  didn't have nervous systems. Given . That last bit's just a theory, though."
HaloStory,3cjc58,kinngshaun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I guess I missed that part whilst reading. The ""Huragok"" theory is pretty interesting but I feel they touched on the species on the installations in the Forerunner Trilogy. All the animals are from other planets and were supposed to be seeded but I guess something might have gone wrong with the Ark's systems to leave all the animals here."

HaloStory,3ch0a4,HK_Urban,4,Wed Jul 8 18:09:21 2015 UTC,Did they make the ship bigger?
HaloStory,3ch0a4,barrettfc,14,Wed Jul 8 05:41:23 2015 UTC,Yes because they thought fighting your way through half a Charon class (roughly 240m of hull length if cut cleanly in half) would be too boring/short so they redesigned it to be bigger and have more going on.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,HK_Urban,10,Wed Jul 8 06:26:16 2015 UTC,Yup. Waaaaay bigger.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Fenris447,0,Wed Jul 8 06:05:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this one really sucks. Making noncanon designs for the sake of gameplay  is silly."

HaloStory,3ch0a4,BraveExpress2,6,Tue Jul 7 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"I see the revisions you're referring to, but those are only a couple of the places where Elites are mentioned, and you can still tell that Nylund was treating them as if the UNSC wasn't very familiar with them.  I never read the 2001 edition, only the new one, and it was clear to me that the UNSC wasn't very familiar with Elites or Brutes. It literally doesn't mention Brutes and says they are hypothesized to exist."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Cabbaggio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:28:58 2015 UTC,That was written prior to Halo 2 though. A lot of little retcons were put into the 2011 reprint.

I'm just saying that when I read the reprint (which was my first time reading The Fall of Reach) it definitely felt like the UNSC had basically only ever fought Grunts and Jackals.   I get why Nylund wouldn't mention Brutes or Prophets, but it seems like a weird choice to leave out Elites and act like Hunters are a new sight since you fight those quite often in Halo CE."

The only one that wasn't is the difference in the amount of time the battle took, which was explained via a very, very awkward and hard to believe explanation that somehow most of the events in H:R were kept under wraps by ONI and the start of what we see in tFoR: was actually only going on towards the end of H:R.   I've always personally felt that using the time warping slipspace crystal from First Strike as an explanation would make more sense, since it was established to have warped time to allow John to return from Alpha Halo 3 weeks early, which matches the time discripency between tFoR and H:R"

HaloStory,3ch0a4,HK_Urban,18,Wed Jul 8 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Prior to Halo 4 and the other post-war extended media, it felt like the covenant had almost succeeded in wiping humanity out.  It seemed like most of the outer colony worlds had been wiped out with relentless meticulous zeal.  Reach was supposed to be our last big stronghold before Earth.  When it fell, it marked what should have been the beginning of the end.  When the covenant showed up at Earth, it felt like losing meant humanity would be all but extinct, with a few clusters of survivors that managed to evade or hide from the covenant.  Without intergalactic trade, surviving wolds would be in dire straights.  Basically by the events of Halo 3 it felt to me like the Covenant genocide of humanity was roughly 95% complete.    Then suddenly you have dozens of major colony worlds cropping up in the extended media as having been ""missed"" by the covenant genocide.  Not just small little outposts, but huge thriving worlds that didn't miss a beat.  No economic collapse when the rest of humanity started dropping off the radar, life just went on.  Of course recolonization was a thing, but the environmental impact of glassing was supposed to leave worlds uninhabitable for decades.  Compare the ending of Halo: Reach, where ground was broken in 2589, whereas now you have colonies like Draco III being up and running within a few years of the end of the war.    I don't mind that 343i wants to find new places for new stories, but can we do so without diluting the severity of the Covenant campaign against Humanity?  Maybe use existing planets whose fates are undetermined instead of coming up with new ones that just happen to be a-OK.  On top of that, the UNSC apparently had the resources available to build not just one super-capital ship, but an entirely new series of ships of the line from frigate up to battleship and carrier, while simultaneously developing and producing hundreds of micro-fusion reactor powered armored suits, previously said to be of equal cost to a small starship.  And all of this in a few short years after the end of the war with humanity's production capabilities severely crippled compared to their state in 2525.  Did we really have that much Titanium-A, Technetium, Selenium, (and whatever other elements are needed) readily available that we hadn't already mined dry in our effort to fight off the covenant?"
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Dauphin_of_Reddit,12,Wed Jul 8 06:42:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of the tech in the new capital ship & frigates were taken from forerunner tech and applied by engineers etc. So that would have cut down on manpower and resources for engines, FTL drives etc. Even with that it is stated that it took 1/2 of the Navy's Budget and probably about the same from ONI's (it was joint owned). Infinity also began before the end of the war, it was a loooong project.   With a stop in the war there was probably better communication between surviving planets, thus better trade/availability of materials. + Glassed planets made an abundance of cheap materials available for computing and whatnot (HtT stated this)  With a couple billion fewer people to take care of there are more resources to invest into the military. Earths (Probably Mars' facilities too) major manufacturing facilities were moved out of system by ONI in anticipation of a covenant attack, so even after the invasion of earth there would be some sort of major production lines running 24/7 assuming they had the resources.   Even with all this it seems like improbably fast growth of technology, economy etc. but hey, humans in 500 years are probably much better at recovery, especially considering they've been fighting a losing for the past 20-something years.  Only reason I remember all this is cause I finished glasslands a few days ago."

Infinity also began before the end of the war, it was a loooong project.   Yeah I get the whole forerunner tech thing and that it was a long time in the making, but forerunner tech just explains why the ships are better and more efficient, not how humanity got all the raw materials.  Logically, anything that isn't molten slag and glass would have been mined and used in cranking out ships for the war effort.  The only new planetary bodies discovered during the war were shield worlds and Halo array components, which have not had any mention if they have the materials we need or if mining efforts were done there.  The only way I could see this new fleet happening is if they scrapped their entire wartime fleet WHILE THERE'S STILL A SERIOUS THREAT TO HUMANITY IN THE GALAXY and used them for parts and slipspace drives, all in a very short timespan.  If that's the case, it's the stupidest thing the UNSC has ever done.     With a couple billion fewer people to take care of there are more resources to invest into the military.   There's also a huge deficit in human capital.  Billions of talented minds and skilled laborers that helped the UNSC get to its wartime strength are gone.   Earths (Probably Mars' facilities too) major manufacturing facilities were moved out of system by ONI in anticipation of a covenant attack, so even after the invasion of earth there would be some sort of major production lines running 24/7 assuming they had the resources.   Contrary to what we see in the Halo: Landfall live action shorts where fabrication facilities were desperately cranking out new equipment and parts to repair and rearm the home fleet in the middle of the conflict."

I'm fairly certain the little live action short was more for theatrical purposes more than hard established canon, and even if it was canon it's clearly old industrial sites or  non orbital ones etc. that are being used.    Its fairly clearly stated in the Kilo-Five books that the major facilities (which would include ship construction and refitting stations etc.) were moved away from Sol.   The glassed worlds were explicitly stated as being useful in HtT, so the actual ""glass"" itself was extremely useful for any electrical components.   I'm not saying it's possible, just that there are reasons to make it slightly more feasible."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,HK_Urban,2,Wed Jul 8 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"The glassed worlds were explicitly stated as being useful in HtT, so the actual ""glass"" itself was extremely useful for any electrical components.   Yeah that was an interesting article but the only real bountiful material stated to come out of glassing is silicates.  Granted, those are important in electronics and insulation, but they are only a small part of the package.  You still need rare earths, titanium-A, tungsten, Technetium, and Selenium, plus whatever else you need to build ships and slipspace drives, none of which are mentioned in Giraud's article and aren't likely to be produced by the glassing process.     Haven't gotten around to reading K5 trilogy, but IIRC the shipyards in orbit of Reach were bigger than the ones in Sol as Reach had sort of grown overtime to become the main hub of the UNSC military (although defense of Earth was still a strategic priority).  Those got mostly destroyed in the battle for Reach.  I'm curious to see what ONI's explanation was for suddenly strapping boosters and FTL drives to Sol's shipyards and moving them and the mobile refit stations out of system.    FLEETCOM: ""Hey ONI, where are you going with those? We kind of need those for the defense of the last major human population center.""  ONI: ""We're moving them.  For reasons.  Classified reasons.""  FLEETCOM: ""Are they reasons we should be concerned about?""  ONI: ""Nope, continue not being on high alert until you hear slipspace whispers near Io."""
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Raptorclaw621,4,Wed Jul 8 16:29:03 2015 UTC,"To comment on that last exchange, both FLEET and ONI knew that they had only months left, if not weeks after Reach fell. Hence it would be of paramount importance to move whatever they could out of the system. This includes shipyards as well as the population. IIRC it's been stated that after the Covenant attacked Earth, the extremely low population recorded to have survived in Earth was after the Covenant killed millions in addition to billions having already evacuated by that point.  So it's not like anyone was being kept in the dark, they all knew it was the end."

I can't recall the exact medium, I think it might have been HTT, but I distinctly remember it being mentioned that the vast majority of people on Earth didn't know just how bad it was thanks to ONI propaganda being too good at its job.  The highest leadership probably knew the odds, but the average Earth civilian, and by extension the rank and file troops (because messages back home was a thing) had to be in the dark to some extent to be caught so far off guard.    For that matter, what exactly was the strategic value of moving the construction resources out of Sol?  If Earth was supposed to be our last big hurrah, you'd want all available resources pooled into the system to make one last ditch effort.  In the military it's called Force Concentration.  You want the largest mass of your forces concentrated around whatever your decisive action is.  If Earth fell, there'd be literally no hope of militarily defeating the covenant.  It would just be a matter of time for them to hunt down remaining colonies and exterminate the survivors.  Our survival (not even remotely a victory) came as a result of internal strife within the covenant that blindsided all but the Hierarchs and probably a handful of trustworthy Chieftains under Tartarus, so saying ONI was expecting that seems a bit of a stretch.    So what exactly was ONI's endstate?  Did they envision fighting a guerilla war against the covenant?  Were they planning on taking the Infinity and doing a BSG style migrant fleet?  Pray that one of the forerunner dig sites would yield a super weapon that was the answer to all our problems?  Was their plan's payoff worth depriving the Home fleet of critical resources needed for their final defense of humanity's core?    Again, I haven't read Kilo 5, but it sounds like they're doing some serious retconning of the dire situation for humanity for the sake of making ONI seem omnitient.  Intelligence agencies can be vastly and scarily powerful, but you can't tell me our understanding of the covenant was so good as to allow us to know what they'd do before even they knew."

Hmm, good point. I guess this really is one of those plot holes that OP asked us about xD  As for what would happen in Earth fell: There would be little we could do but hope and pray that we managed to acquire some Forerunner tech, as you said, or maybe relocate to the next biggest colony. There were still a whole bunch left, so humanity could have continued fighting the losing battle while constantly retreating... :/ Was the payoff worth it? Idk, fighting the Covenant was a losing battle. So they could try to muster one last hard punch, and what better place to try than to defend the last core stronghold of Earth?  Well Kilo-5 really does fuck with a lot of lore around censorship as well. As if ONI would divulge top secret eyes only info on the formation of the spartan project to a terrorist... Plus many other things, this really made me hate Mortal Dictata most of all (in addition to the frankly sickening amounts of Halsey-hate and bastardisations of characters we already knew and loved.)"
HaloStory,3ch0a4,tblots4,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"They never said anything about relocating ships or any such thing, only construction facilities and staff which would be useless in a fight anyway!

OR use their knowledge of forerunner worlds and possibly try retreat to such places so as to glean technology or take weapons and such (or take shelter seeing as they can control the entrances, assuming they have that information and are still alive)   If they got infinity running after earth falling it would be used for space domination, it would take on smaller fleets putting dents into the covenant navy.  As for manpower, they are 500 years ahead of us, they have incredibly intelligent AI's that are more powerful than all of earths current processing power, easily. That combined with (I imagine) automated shipyards and resource gathering etc. machinery would make the logistics of rebuilding completely different to anything of today. It would be at a completely different scale but managed near perfection due to AI's and such, not relying on imperfect humans to allocate resources poorly  etc. I imagine it would be a slow rebuild at first but would gather speed exponentially (as war facilitates technological growth). Bonus point is immediately after the war there were millions of refugees flooding to earth, I'm sure that helped with the physical work and such.   Still a huge feat but you get my point, if a bit rambling."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,wildedge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:39:34 2015 UTC,"They never said anything about relocating ships or any such thing, only construction facilities and staff which would be useless in a fight anyway!   I have to disagree with you there.  Construction facilities would be invaluable to the defense of Earth, as I outlined in my other posts.  As long as you have the raw materials and the volunteers to crew them, it is in your best interest to keep cranking out new ships as long as possible right up until contact is made, in the event that one last ship might be enough to turn the tide.  Sure, it might be possible to turn out ships somewhere other than the Sol system, but if defense of Earth is a priority, it's a waste of time having those ships make the slipspace trip from where ever the hell they are, not to mention inactivating the facilities for however long it takes to move them out of the Sol system.    Even during the battle of Earth, construction facilities are valuable to the fight even if they can't do any fighting.  Ships that take on damage but aren't completely destroyed can retreat to construction facilities or refit stations for repair and rearming, again as exemplified by Landfall.  (If Landfall is indeed canon, it would probably have been a hell of a lot more efficient for the ship in the short scene to get its repairs done in orbit than having to breech atmosphere).  And as a last ditch effort, refit stations could use their large profiles to provide cover from plasma fire for UNSC warships, as the UNSC Cradle did during the battle of Sigma Octanus IV.  It bought the UNSC fleet there some time and breathing room, and the same tactic was used on Reach.  Moving those out of system deprives the Home Fleet of that tactical resource, however unorthadox it may be.     hope for the best or some technological breakthrough or Bio weapons (like the ones tested in Kilo-5 trilogy) to turn the tide.   Hope is not a valid strategy.  You can hope for the best, but you better damn well plan to make due with what you've got because you won't be able to do anything today with what you might have tomorrow.  Sure, it's clear the Forerunner technology is powerful and way ahead of our tech tier, but hoping the scientists will be able to decypher artifacts in time to do something useful with it, and hoping that it would be enough to turn the tide of the war is a huge gamble when the fate of the entire species is on the line.     OR use their knowledge of forerunner worlds and possibly try retreat to such places so as to glean technology or take weapons and such (or take shelter seeing as they can control the entrances, assuming they have that information and are still alive)   Trying to retreat to shield worlds like Onyx might be a viable strategy assuming the Covenant can't find it or breach it, both of which are huge assumptions.    If ONI was planning to save construction facilities by moving them out of Sol, that means they probably thought the Home fleet's defense would not outlast a full scale covenant assault (which is a reasonable assumption given the facts at the time).  If that's the case, why half ass it?  Why not evacuate more essential resources out of the system?  Why keep your senior leadership in Sol?  If you plan on continuing fighting after Earth falls, it doesn't make sense to have your commanders who are planning such a fight get themselves killed in a suicide mission.  Why not move your most valuable ships and soldiers to your fallback point?  Why even waste the fleet defending Earth in the first place if you know it's not going to work.  Earth falls, you lose the home fleet, now you have even fewer resources with which to fight the covenant.  (Sorry, I ramble too)   If they got infinity running after earth falling it would be used for space domination   Just like putting all our faith in forerunner research, putting all of our hope in one ship that isn't done yet and is the first of its line so it might not even work right is a risky gamble.  The Infinity proves itself as a formidable ship in the post war period, but we have no way of knowing how combat effective it is before it sees first combat.    Also, no ship is invincible.  The Titanic proved that, the Bismarck proved that, and even the Infinity herself proved that in the post-war period when it was ambushed by a space station with a glassing beam and took critical damage.     it would take on smaller fleets putting dents into the covenant navy.   Sure the Infinity might be able to handle herself against a small or maybe even moderately sized covenant fleet, but what happens if the Covenant stage an ambush with more than the Infinity can handle?  You have the sinking of the Bismarck all over again, and the UNSC is now without a plan and without a hope.     machinery would make the logistics of rebuilding completely different to anything of today.    Yes but you still need resources and I still stand by my assertion that the UNSC would have mined and used the hell out of whatever resources they could during the war effort, leaving precious little at the end of the war that wasn't already mined dry or glassed into unusability.  We can have all of the ship yards in the world, but it won't make a lick of difference if we don't have the titanium to feed into their fabricators.  Not to mention we DON'T have all of the ship yards in the world.  We lost a lot of our production capability with Reach, so we're going to be building fleets at a fraction of the pace we did in the first two decades of the war.     Bonus point is immediately after the war there were millions of refugees flooding to earth, I'm sure that helped with the physical work and such   Millions do not make up for billions.  Prior to the HCW, we were already in a wartime state.  The powers that be knew that their control over human space was in jeopardy if they couldn't quickly put down the insurrection.  Militarization within the UNSC was pretty high at the time, even if it was geared towards irregular warfare.  Then the Covenant comes along and the UNSC's military budget balloons up, becoming humanity's number one priority.  Every able bodied volunteer was under arms, heading invariably to their deaths aboard a ship or on the surface.  Every world lost meant fewer scientists, fewer educators, fewer laborers, fewer leaders, fewer thinkers.  Humanity's output towards the war effort had to be at its peak some time between the battle of Harvest and the Fall of Reach.  Anything after that and it's safe to say the impact of the loss of human capital would make our output far less efficient.    Again, taking a real life example, Germany's situation grew increasingly more dire towards the end of World War II.  Before the tables turned against them, the German war machine was operating with deadly efficiency, able to affect control on parts of three continents.  As their situation grew more dire and troops, territory, morale, and production facilities were lost, the Nazi government pushed their population to the limit, trying desperately to build enough to keep up with and eventually overcome the invading Allied forces.    And guess what?  It didn't work for them.  Even though the situation was dire, their efforts were in vein, forestalling the inevitable fall of Berlin and the death of Nazi rule in Europe.  It wasn't working for the UNSC, either.    After the war, it took decades for the two halves of Germany to get back on their feet, and even then it was due significantly to foreign involvement in getting Germany ready to be at the forefront of the Cold War.  You could say the UNSC would take less time to get back on their feet, but the German people weren't brought to the brink of extinction like Humanity was in Halo.  And with the disparate covenant factions still fighting each other, I doubt sympathetic factions (besides the Huragok) would bother to send significant capital or resources our way when they have their own fights to fight.  (Hell, I would have loved to see a post war UNSC resemble a late/post war Germany, with Marine battalions made up of young boys and old men, a failing economy (excluding exploitative mining firms like BXR), etc. and on top of that the threat of insurrection from the surviving colonies that we do have in the official story)   (as war facilitates technological growth)   You'd think that, but the games and extended media have shown us little in the way of technological advancement in the 27 years between first contact and the battle for Earth, and nowhere near the level of advancement and refinement of military hardware that you'd expect from an interstellar civilization threatened with extinction.  Most changes seen are either cosmetic or directly related to the development of the Spartan program and aren't going to impact the UNSCDF as a whole.  As of Halo 3, I recall certain weapons like the Spartan Laser and the MA5C were supposed to be more recent developments towards the end of the war, but then later games had them retcon the production timeline so these weapons existed early war as well.  It's understandably a case of gameplay trumps lore, but I wish they'd taken more time thinking about the lore and background which is so important to people who want to get immersed in the story.   Whew.  I think that's about all the rant/ramble I've got left in me today."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,skilledwarman,3,Fri Jul 10 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm used to all these colonies now, but I was a little disappointed that humanity was actually suddenly not in such a dire situation with all these new books. It seemed like 343 thought the rebuilding process would take too long and be too boring for fans, so they just arbitrarily decided to add dozens of powerful planets. And you're right it really does dilute the severity of the Battle of Earth and the Fall of Reach.  And I would have really liked a detailed Keyes-like breakdown of ships in this modern era ... how badly we were hit during the battle of Earth, how many were being produced, what kind of tech they have, are weapons better, etc. So far all we know is that some ships have shields and most have better slipspace speed and reliability."

HaloStory,3ch0a4,FishFlies,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:34:50 2015 UTC,"I think the same discrepancies between gameplay and lore exist with aesthetics - M52B armor has had several different visual interpretations (Halo: Reach, Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo CEA, Halo 2 A) - the H2A redesign is one of them.

HaloStory,3ch0a4,wildedge,5,Wed Jul 8 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"In support of /u/CommanderMilez explanation, think of the UNSC military as less like the US or a NATO country and more like Russia.  You have a vastly huge swath of territory to outfit with a wide range of climatological and strategic needs.  Certain planets and systems are going to be higher risk and therefore the units stationed there are going to need the newest and best equipment as soon as you can crank it out and ship it to them.  Others are low risk and can get by with obsolete resources.  Just like how Russia has some units with their latest tanks, latest guns, and latest personal equipment, but a lot are still getting by with old camo, uparmored Cold War era tanks, and AK-74's.  Contrast to the US where there is heavy standardization of equipment across units and modifications made only when needed by the mission.    When the war with the covenant starts, your up to date units are probably going to be part of your spearhead and counteroffensive, and are therefore going to be wiped out in the early stages of the war, along with their latest equipment.  Sure, new stuff will be developed and fielded throughout the war, but a lot of units are going to be fighting only with what's available.     (Plus, it also annoys me that the armor is heavily outdated by 25+ years and has already been replaced)   The M808 Scorpion is supposedly more than 200 years old, and for a real life example, the M2 Browning has been around and rarely changed since World War II."

As you can see, the 4 design shares almost exactly the same silloute as the 3 one, it's really just the eyes and  mandibles that are tweaked to make the design a little more realistic and fierce.

HaloStory,3ch0a4,kinngshaun,6,Thu Jul 9 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't a plothole so much as ""What were they thinking?""  Why in God's name did the Forerunners seal the Flood up on the Halo rings? I know Faber had humans experimented upon using the Flood on Installation 7, but why in the hell would the Forerunners use their weapon system as a prison? If you're going to incarcerate a prisoner, you don't put him in the prison's fucking armoury. Yeah, you threw away the key, but now he has a dozen fucking guns.  Why isn't there a station with strictly controlled access, at the centre of every Halo's firing trajectory, in a decaying orbit around a black hole such that the orbit can only be corrected remotely once a periodic all-clear has been received from onboard the station, and with a hundred thousand planet-busting guns pointed at it and set to go off the second after contact is lost? That's where I'd keep the Flood.  Also, if Isolation is a canonical location on the Ark, then the Forerunners deserved to go extinct - every single man, woman, and child. Not only would you keep the Flood on your ultimate anti-Flood weapon, but you'd keep them on the very thing that is supposed to be safe from your anti-Flood weapon? The wisdom of your countless generations must have leaked out your fucking ears."

HaloStory,3ch0a4,IAmTriscuit,5,Tue Jul 7 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's ironic how 343i is incorporating extended universe lore into the games more than Bungie but just left this little detail out."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,TheNerdyOne_,6,Tue Jul 7 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"They're probably trying to avoid the topic as much as possible. Considering its a pretty controversial topic, they're probably going to leave it alone to avoid pissing fans off."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,ILLNOTSICK,5,Tue Jul 7 22:56:40 2015 UTC,It's the same armour. Just looks different.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,5,Wed Jul 8 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"That's not unexplained.  Cortana altered the armor through the use of nanobots.  This was first mentioned in an interview with Frankie by GameInformer (I believe the video is called ""The Science of Halo"" or something along those lines), and has been alluded to multiple times since then."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,jabberwockxeno,20,Wed Jul 8 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ""unexplained"" wasn't the correct way to put it. I'm aware of that explanation, but in my opinion, it's a shitty explanation and it still bothers me to this day."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,7,Wed Jul 8 01:20:13 2015 UTC,"Then it's a good thing it's not actually an official explanation! The explanation is a combination of unrelated information thrown together with twisted information and unconfirmed sources. 343i has yet to give an official explanation on the matter, but based on many pieces of evidence it's apparent the change was simply artistic and doesn't have a canonical explanation."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,TheNerdyOne_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:18:21 2015 UTC,You sure about that? Because I recall it being stated directly a few times.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:33:48 2015 UTC,I've dug around the internet extensively and there isn't a single confirmation of the theory. The only thing they confirmed is that the suit was repaired by nanobots and that it has been updated. Note that an update is not the same thing as an upgrade so it's probably mentioning the firmware update in game. If you can find a source confirmation feel free to share it.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,TheNerdyOne_,5,Thu Jul 9 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it's a bad explanation.  It fits within the canon and, as Frankie said, nanotechnology has come a long way in the past 500 years.  The idea is perfectly sound."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,7,Thu Jul 9 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"It's a bad explanation because it contradicts plenty of evidence within the Halo Universe and it isn't even an explanation given to us by 343, but rather a fan theory bunching together unrelated information."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,TheNerdyOne_,0,Wed Jul 8 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"First of all, it was directly stated by Frankie.  Second, what exactly does it contradict?"
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,7,Wed Jul 8 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"It wasn't directly stated by Frankie. He said Chief's armor was repaired, not upgraded, by Cortana. Other than that there's no mention of nanomachines interacting with Chief's armor whatsoever. While I prepare a list of evidence against the theory, could you compile a list of evidence supporting it? The discussion will go much more smoothly if all the evidence is in the same place."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,TheNerdyOne_,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:47:25 2015 UTC,"I already know your list of evidence for it, and you already know my list of evidence against it (though my list has grown as more content relating to Chief has been released).  I was asking specifically about what it contradicts.  Frankie stated it had been repaired, 343i later went on to say that it was redesigned.  We've been over this before."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Chrall97,6,Wed Jul 8 05:59:45 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source for that? So far no mention of the suit being redesigned canonically has been stated anywhere by 343. The only evidence used to support the theory is;   Frankie's ""The Science Behind Halo"" Interview The Halo Bulletin Q&A regarding Chief's armor looking different than the Mark VI in multiplayer. Page 10 and 157 of the Halo 4: the Essential Visual Guide.   All of those sources don't ever confirm the nanobot theory. The interview mentions repairs to the armor, not upgrades and the Q&A just says it's a unique Cortana variant which could have multiple meanings. Even the visual guide doesn't support it at all, as page 10 only means the armor was updated by Cortana(firmware) and that the variant used by Chief resembles a line of Mark IV and page 157 is talking about Mark VI armor as a whole, but not Chief's specific variant. Even Stephan Loftus agrees there hasn't been an official explanation for the change and that he doesn't think it's likely there'll be one as 343 won't address the topic anymore than they'll have to."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,-6,Wed Jul 8 06:07:28 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I was asking specifically about the contradictions you mentioned.  I don't care to get into that whole discussion again, it will go nowhere."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Chrall97,3,Wed Jul 8 06:25:19 2015 UTC,"APPARENTLY, Cortana used nanobats to improve his armor over the course of 4 years. I have no reference, and I cannot remember where i heard this for the life of me, but it worked for me."

HaloStory,3ch0a4,Ardusk,3,Wed Jul 8 01:01:31 2015 UTC,Oh my god... Nanobots.  But you get an upvote for the laughs.
HaloStory,3ch0a4,skilledwarman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:26:11 2015 UTC,"People are saying it was nanobots that re did his armor, but that's not correct. I doubt anyone can find anything official that states Cortana used nanobots to change it."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,rainypixels,5,Wed Jul 8 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"You're right. The only mention of nanobots doing anything to Chief's armor was that they were used to repair it. Other than that, there has been no mention of them having anything to do with upgrading his armor and there is plenty of evidence supporting the fact that it was an artistic change."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,stylz168,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:32:04 2015 UTC,You're correct. It's flat out stated in one of the Halo 4 ViDocs that 343i's artists just wanted to do their take on the armor.

The UNSC manages not only rebuild but to renew (multiple new ship classes) a huge fleet in just a couple years, after everything was destroyed in the last few months of the war.  Also, the slipspace speeds and Skype calls to earth are a prime example of a deus ex machina style plothole, as in Forerunner tech fitted by Huragok."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,Kody_Z,9,Wed Jul 8 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest for me is the UNSC's recovery from the war and the rapid technological advancement portrayed in Kilo Five. The UNSC manages not only rebuild but to renew (multiple new ship classes) a huge fleet in just a couple years, after everything was destroyed in the last few months of the war.   It's improbable, but far from impossible. The UNSC Infinity for example had been under construction long before the war ended. The Autumn-class cruisers basically just copied and refined the Pillar of Autumn's design, which was based on the longstanding Halcyon-class design that the shipyards would be familiar with manufacturing.     The Strident-class frigates would be probably the biggest fly in the ointment. There is no record of them being in development prior to the war's end, but my own theory is that frigates (due to their smaller size and relatively low cost) would be the ideal testbed for ship-based energy shields. Given that the Spartan IIs only received energy shielded Mjolnir armor in 2552, it stands to reason that research had been ongoing prior to that for ship-based energy shields due to the fact that they would be easier to implement on the fixed shape and with the larger power supply of a starship. The Strident-class Frigates are most likely a result of this research. In addition, the fact that they can be deployed from the Infinity heavily implies that they were developed in conjunction with the flagship, hence their shared energy shield tech.  Most importantly though, don't forget the significant impact that captured Huragok had on UNSC military tech. Even if you ignore the Forerunner tech they implemented to the likes of the UNSC Infinity, their skills alone would be invaluable."

I think her's is still a good arc, but we haven't seen the end. Think about when she and keyes were first scoping john out in FoR. She felt guilt about what she was doing but justified it with her ""ends justified the means"" mentality, which solidified when the covenant attacked. Now she has not only the program to do it with, but a desperate ONI telling her ""save humanity"". So she does. but once she's saved them, now ONI goes back on their word and makes her the pariah. So now what we see is Halsey apply that mentality to herself. If she has to betray ONI to accomplish her goals so be it, since she's been operating so long under these justifications anyway."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,tblots4,13,Wed Jul 8 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"This one's kind of a biggy for me ... but Master Chief being 'humanized'. 343 really seems to like this route, but honestly the Master Chief is not that messed up, all things considered, at least not worse than any other S-II or S-III. He loves all his S-IIs and he probably sees CPO Mendez and Halsey as mentors (parents would be too strong to describe them). He has a totally honourable soldier's mentality - he'll suspend a mission to save civilians and other soldiers (like all of the Halo games, destruction of the city on Sigma Octanus IV) and he decided to save Johnson from being vivisected due to his flood immunity (although I know that's kind of been changed). He's a quiet guy and sort of isolated as their leader, but he still interacts pretty informally with his team, especially now that Fred will be co-team lead or however that'll work.  So what is the Chief's arc? He becomes more expressive? He falls in love with a biological Cortana made from a reverse-Composer (ugh)? He gets therapy for his PTSD? I think the Chief is a great character and I do like the dilemma he goes through in Halo 4, by choosing Cortana over Del Rio, but this whole ""I'm a machine"" thing doesn't jive that well with me. I feel like the Kilo-5 trilogy with Naomi was a test run for the Chief's story and although I didn't like it, I don't know how it could have been done any better.  In any case, the core of this game for me has always been the sci-fi aspects, like ancient wars, AI, gigantic constructs, destiny of a species, etc. I would prefer if the personal stuff was kept to the background and more understated because I don't think Halo would work well with too much emotion-meddling."

Also in Fall of Reach during the test with Cortana he didn't kill any of the ODSTs. It's pretty clear the war changed his perspective. That whole arc happens before the games even start, so I don't see what the purpose of redoing it in Halo 4 is.  His focus on winning is not necessarily a bad thing, and in any case he has learned to balance 'winning', i.e. following orders, with more appreciable objectives, like saving civilians and captured marines, retrieving Cortana, stopping the Didact, saving Fred, Kelly, Anton and others on a burned Reach, etc. Even during training when he had to win by getting to the Pelican, he said 'No, no one is walking home' and he took down the guards guarding the Pelican and took them all home."

Keep in mind that it was really the Elites who were all about the killing of humans. The Jackals were perfectly fine with living and sharing space among the humans, and after the Covenant was broken up, they went back to their old ways."

On that note I'm also not a big fan of how Jackals look in Halo 4 and 5. It makes sense that there would be different races within each species as with humans, but their design just doesn't sit well with me."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,JacksonSX35,2,Wed Jul 15 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"I've got a few.   Halo CE: Two Betrayals is a complete waste of time, and Cortana should have known. You disrupt the generators in case Spark finds a way to activate halo. Cortana was in the system, and knew what they were for, but didn't know Spark couldn't activate the ring himself? Nah, let's waste time backtracking, so the flood can kill Keys, Spark can get in the Pillar of Autumn's system, and we have to make a crazy escape.   Halo 2: Gravemind has Arbiter and Chief literally in his grasp. Instead of killing them, he sends them to get the index to divert their attention. ""In Amber Clad was always his intended vector.""   Halo 3: When the flood arrive on earth, Arbiter asks ""Brutes?"" and Chief says ""No, worse."" The Arbiter was on Installation 04 and 05, and has seen the flood before. How did he not know?   These are just little things I noticed playing through the ""Master Chief Saga"" playlist to replay the campaigns. I'll probably see a few more when I get to Halo 4."
HaloStory,3ch0a4,skilledwarman,17,Wed Jul 8 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"The Gravemind knew the brutes would activate Halo and kill all potential hosts in the next several thousand light-years if he didn't do something, so he sent Chief to try to kill the prophets, and sent the Arbiter to retrieve the index.

I'm sure half their resources were dedicated to keeping track of and destroying if necessary all those records. I'm sure the Chief and the Spartans and the ODSTs were all used extensively to that end write often throughout the war. They likely had several smart AIs dedicated to this task, scouring the various networks of Humanity."
HaloStory,3cha4w,Dekar2401,12,Tue Jul 7 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"Halo uprising showcases a perfect example of the covenants ignorance towards humans in general.

Elites and Brutes were expected to execute all none military personnel seeing them them as hectics. Unless higher covenant branch ordered capture of important figures civilians would either perish to open conflict war, be rounded up in concentration camps and be eliminate, or just obliterate by planetary glassing offensives.

HaloStory,3cfung,HeyLudaYouLikeToEat,15,Tue Jul 7 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"The Hunters were always my favorite enemy back when I was just a kid endlessly replaying Combat Evolved.  I loved them so much that I fought them with weapons other than the pistol/sniper, just to make them threatening.  I was super pumped when they teamed up with you in Halo 2.  Opening that door and coming face to face with two hunters and hearing an elite cry out ""The Hunters have come to our aid!"" was so damn cool.  After seeing Lekgolo form in the Halo 5 trailer, I'm excited to see what kind of surprises they have in store for us."
HaloStory,3cfung,Solias,6,Tue Jul 7 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the CE Hunters. I refuse to fight them with the Pistol.  And ""The Hunters have come to our aid, Arbiter; they will fight by our side"", is one of the greatest lines in all of Halo. Then Halo 3 comes along and Bungie doesn't want to ""confuse us"" so doesn't give us our own Hunters. Fuck that, people are intelligent enough to know the difference if you point it out well enough."
HaloStory,3cfung,Dekar2401,10,Tue Jul 7 22:33:56 2015 UTC,Having the Hunters on your (the Arbiter's) side in Halo 2 is one of the best gameplay/story moments in Halo for me.

Direct shots to the armor shouldn't count, but there is a gap in between the armor and it frustrates me that you can't snipe that place. I once killed a hunter with a single pistol shot in CE. I felt badass."
HaloStory,3cfung,GandalfBlue12,3,Tue Jul 7 17:00:20 2015 UTC,That's because in CE the orange part counts as their head so its a headshot.

HaloStory,3cfafe,JDP623,21,Tue Jul 7 13:40:01 2015 UTC,Linda was clinically dead following a mission durine the Fall of Reach- she was placed in cryo to preserve her body in hopes of later resuscitation (which was thankfully successful). So unfortunately MC had to solo it.

HaloStory,3cfafe,TheEld,25,Tue Jul 7 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"Linda was aboard the UNSC Pillar of Autumn for a short time until the Fall of Reach began. She was designated as Blue-Three, part of John-117's team to Reach Station Gamma to destroy the unsecured NAV database of the Office of Naval Intelligence's UNSC Circumference. John had chosen Linda for the mission due to her omnipotent abilities with a sniper rifle, figuring the space dock they were about to board would be large enough that her skills would be a tremendous asset. During that mission, James-005 was out of commission and presumed KIA when his thruster pack was damaged by a Needler, causing him to spin out of control. Linda and John were forced to enter the station, which was filled with Sangheili and Kig-Yar Rangers. She found the bay and assisted Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson's squad in holding off the Covenant forces long enough to escape. However, as they jumped out of their Pelican to open the bay doors, she was hit by several overcharged bolts from plasma pistols and plasma rifles, which penetrated her armor and flesh all the way to the bone. One of the globules of plasma hit her in the back of the skull. Linda was recovered by a horrified John, but her vitals flatlined, and she was presumed dead.  John-117, disheartened over the death of his close teammate, took her to the cryo facilities where they immediately froze Linda's body in a cryo chamber. The UNSC Pillar of Autumn then jumped to Installation 04. As the ship was shot down by Covenant forces, most of the cryo chambers, including Linda's, were ejected as per standard UNSC procedure. She floated above the Halo for several days until after the destruction of the the installation. Linda was then detected by Cortana and John, who were in a Longsword fighter. They picked her and two other cryo pods up, but both of the other occupants had died when their chambers failed. When John-117, SSgt. Avery Johnson, Corporal Locklear, Lieutenant Elias Haverson, and PO2 Shiela Polaski captured the Covenant CSO-class supercarrier flagship Ascendant Justice, Linda, still in her cryo chamber, was brought aboard. Due to the extent of her injuries, she was left frozen until certified medical staff was available. She stayed on the Ascendant Justice until Dr. Halsey was rescued from Reach along with Fred-104 and the survivors of his team. Dr. Halsey revived Linda aboard the UNSC Gettysburg. Doctor Halsey ended up performing surgery on Linda, transplanting her with newly flash-cloned kidneys and a liver which needed to be replaced due to her injuries. The operation was successful and Linda survived, but Doctor Halsey said it would be at least a week before she should even get out of bed; however, Linda disregarded this due to the imminent threat to Earth, and seemed to recover at least enough to go on a mission within a few days."

Planets on the otherhand wouldn't need to house that information at all."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Wyatt1313,6,Tue Jul 7 05:03:00 2015 UTC,yeah but they have made communications with earth and other planets and that would give a planets co-ordinates away
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Halofreak1171,2,Tue Jul 7 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Well I'm speculating here but I think this theory holds. For planetary communication they have communication relays on the planet. All these do is connect the signal with an orbiting communications space station where it can point the signal at different planets. The station has the locations for all the planets (or perhaps just relays put in the  middle of nowhere that bounce signals to the core planets) and the stations follow the Cole protocol. Having a giant dish on the planet constantly pointed at earth would be impossible, all communications would have to be directed out in space."

HaloStory,3cdtjl,Kody_Z,27,Tue Jul 7 14:16:43 2015 UTC,We know of several reasons.   Forerunner artifacts. Glassing cannot be risked if it might damage holy relics!  Anti-ship defenses that need to be taken out groundside.  Collecting intelligence and coordinates for other worlds.  Satisfying Sangheili honor.  Glassing may not be undertaken before lengthy religious ceremonies.
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Tyranniac,3,Tue Jul 7 05:10:19 2015 UTC,Glassing may not be undertaken before lengthy religious ceremonies.   Really?  I've never heard of that before.
HaloStory,3cdtjl,msd011,2,Tue Jul 7 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mentioned in Halo: Evolutions I believe."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Tyranniac,2,Tue Jul 7 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"In the story The Return an Elite shipmaster tells of the long process of scripture, meditation, And judgment he undertook before delivering a perfect family/religious crest on the planet before glassing proceedings could start."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,wildedge,2,Wed Jul 8 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"During the Fall of Reach, the main objective of the Covenant's ground invasion was to cut power to the broadcast generators powering the Super MAC guns in orbit.  It didn't really matter that much since they got blown to bits anyway, but that was part of it."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Always_Has_A_Boner,9,Fri Jul 10 04:36:30 2015 UTC,"Is say it's the same reason why in contemporary warfare you can't accomplish everything with air strikes, even if you have superior technology. A lot of well-fortified military bases would be equipped to survive glassing, and would only be destroyed by prolonged bombardment, such as truth's fleet uncovering the portal.   So typically ground invasions are to take out strategic targets, or capture specific Intel. The Covenant have powerful ships but they're not invisible so they destroy shipyards and airfields, take out military bases and leadership. That way the big ships can roll in, and mop up the population centers with minimal resistance.  When the covenant meet a significant human fleet they have to commit more of their ships to support the invasion force. That's when you end up with a longer ground engagement, with the UNSC providing enough support to keep key locations on the ground secure and evacuate civilians, while the covenant pushes in. If the covenant just rolled in and started glassing the planet then they would be vulnerable to a counterattack.  Also on many occasions they have been trying to find forerunner artifacts, or locate coordinates to other human colonies."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,forgottenduck,8,Tue Jul 7 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"If the covenant just rolled in and started glassing the planet then they would be vulnerable to a counterattack.   Isn't it also true that on certain Convenant vessels at least, using the glassing beam draws power from the energy shields making the ship vulnerable?"
HaloStory,3cdtjl,lord_addictus,7,Tue Jul 7 12:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I believe that is mentioned in one of the earlier books, but I'm not sure where. We know at least that when firing the ventral beam there is an opening in the shields where the beam comes out, because that's how you're able to destroy the ship at the end of Halo: Reach."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,forgottenduck,2,Tue Jul 7 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"This is the reason in my mind...they have to get on the ground to fully wipe the people out from shelters, and if its a weak planet its probably not cost effective to glass it."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,alawn0204,6,Wed Jul 8 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"From the ending of Contact Harvest, this was the reasoning I came to believe.  The luminaries identify humans as artifacts.  This was not fixed because Truth realized they could use it to hunt humanity.  As a result, any time the Covenant arrived on a human world, they would deploy, search for relics and then, as they winked out from their ground invasion or casualties became too great, they glassed the planet in retribution for the humans destroying/hiding the artifacts they thought existed."
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Solias,4,Tue Jul 7 17:40:29 2015 UTC,"Man, I bet those covenant bastards were getting so frustrated by the end of the war. I imagine them pouting around about humans ""destroying"" all the artifacts.   ""UGHHHG! The Humans always destroy all the artifacts whenever we land on their planets! I just want to pick up one artifact! Just one!""  On a more serious note, its pretty impressive that nobody ever(or was allowed to) put two and two together and say ""Hey, you know whats weird? Every time we kill a bunch of Humans all the artifacts disappear from the luminary. So strange."""
HaloStory,3cdtjl,Kody_Z,4,Tue Jul 7 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"I suppose it makes sense.   Anyone who wasn't a prophet or a minor prophet (minus Huragok) weren't allowed to study the artifacts. This coupled with the fact that the ones who use them probably only understood how to read the results and not actually check for actual artifacts, means that really no one would know how to question it.  That and Humans are heretics. Vile beasts who are not above destroying holy relics just to deny them to the Covenant. (Or so they thought.)"
HaloStory,3cdtjl,FishFlies,2,Tue Jul 7 23:15:37 2015 UTC,Wasn't it a Kig Yar ship/crew with a luminary that discovered harvest though?   I suppose after harvest the prophets could have restricted access to the luminaries. So that still makes sense.

They are capable of mimicking the language of other species, forming words and sentences that are ""felt rather than heard.""[6][7] Their quiet nature among other races of the Covenant is possibly a result of difficulty speaking with other Covenant races. The known names of some Mgalekgolo seem to imply that they use very simple vowels and only a few consonants""  ""Lekgolo follow their own cultural traditions rather than the homogenized religion of the wider Covenant.[9] They never associate or communicate with the other races in the Covenant Empire and are dismissive, contemptuous, and arrogant towards them. Mgalekgolo also have no qualms about committing friendly fire against races they consider ""lesser,"" such as Unggoy and Kig-Yar. However, Sangheili are an exception, as the Mgalekgolo respect their adeptness in combat.  Their culture is more refined than one would presume from their hulking appearance: they are known to tear opponents apart with their bare hands while in a blood frenzy and then suddenly pause to recite war poetry. Religious beliefs vary, but believe in a type of ""afterlife."" Some also meditate in their spare time or before battle.""  Source for those who don't know about these big teddy bears."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,DrummerBoy2999,2,Mon Jul 6 06:08:08 2015 UTC,Why do the prophets excuse them from religious beliefs? Is it simply because they are bigger?
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Grim-Enigma,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"That sir is a great question, I'm not sure about it.   But my guess would be, when the Jackals joined the Covenant, they where payed to join the fold, they make profit and the prophets get capable soldiers.   So my complete guess is, it's not mandatory to believe in the great journey, but taboo to be public about it.   Haha, it definitely could be because they are bigger and have some contempt to the lesser races."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,DrummerBoy2999,2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, and its not like there weren't plenty of people not believing in The Great Journey, including prophets."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Nerd_Hero,8,Wed Jul 8 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"I think a story from the perspective of the leader of the Grunt rebellion would be cool. The book would delve into the culture of the species while also painting more history into the Covenant. One of the coolest scenes in Broken Circle was when the main character was recalling recent history and mentioned the bravery and intrepedity of the Grunts in their effort to rebel against the oppression they suffered. We only really get to see one side of the Grunts, as comical peons with little or no backbone, but in truth they are much more than that. They even had the might to nearly overthrow the Covenant.   I would also like to read a book that is written from the perspective of a Prophet specializing in Human studies during the war. I would like to get a sense of what the covenant thought of Humanity as a race, after having engaged them for so long."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Susto,5,Mon Jul 6 04:20:04 2015 UTC,Mainly the lesser races like Kig-yar and Unggoy. In addition I'd really  like to see 343i start delving further into the species within the Fringe.
HaloStory,3c8rx9,patriot050,2,Mon Jul 6 02:37:45 2015 UTC,last book in kilo-five really got into kig-yar life.
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Cabbaggio,4,Mon Jul 6 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"The Prophets mostly. I'd love to know what they're up to at this point.   But I'd take any other species as well. The way the Brutes, Jackals, etc. are all portrayed makes it hard for me to imagine how they could possibly have functioning societies."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Metagenic,3,Mon Jul 6 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"The Brutes... don't have a properly functioning society. Their clans fight each other for turf, they fight each other at the slightest provocation, and they've nuked themselves back to the stone age once. The reason the Elites were able to secure their upper hand over them after the Great Schism was because the Brutes eventually fell apart from infighting. They couldn't unite long enough even to fight against a species they hated.   You know how notorious gangs like the Bloods and Crips kill each other for wearing the wrong color or being in the wrong territory, and the only time they'll ever band with each other is when an external enemy like the police are cracking down on both? That's kind of what Brute society is like. It works for them, sure, but it's inherently dysfunctional."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Flamehad,5,Mon Jul 6 01:02:16 2015 UTC,So Brutes are effectively the Orks from Warhamer 40K. Could be the main force in the universe but they are literally their own worst enemy.  In that case I think they would be a really interesting faction to look at since you could tell really interesting stories with the tribal mechanic and individual tribal leaders doing galaxy changing things on will alone.
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Metagenic,4,Mon Jul 6 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"You should read Stomping on the Heels of a Fuss, in Halo Evolutions. Basically, a Brute contingent captures a human planet and sets up a torture camp, but the Brutes in that group are a mix of two opposing tribes, so they eventually snap and start killing each other over a dispute for the right to be Chieftain. A few humans use that to escape."
HaloStory,3c8rx9,Flamehad,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I have read that story. It was interesting, especially how the covenant loyal Brute gets another younger stronger one to head the rebel voices since he himself does not stand a chance against the current chief. That why I think they could be an interesting faction, make them a bit smarter and you could have a interesting race. As loyal as the Elites but as cunning as the Jackals. On the surface they have to all appear like they are following the head chief but in reality they are furthering their own goals. Classical political intrigue"

HaloStory,3c8rx9,Cabbaggio,3,Mon Jul 6 15:28:56 2015 UTC,Tartarus wasn't randomly selected. He challenged and killed his own uncle to become Chieftain of their pack in the middle of a first contact and then kicked the humans' asses on Harvest.

The Ark's cartographer. Plus that landing of the FuD.  This slot goes to ODST's Data Hive. Something about working your way down really caught me, and the conclusion to Sadie's story is nothing short of heartbreaking.  I always will have a place for Halo 4's campaign, and Requiem had one of the best reveals of a landscape since Halo 1.

Requiem (4) - When you come out of that canyon and look across the landscape and forerunner architecture, it's jawdropping and not something I experienced since Halo 1. The music in perfect sync with how massive everything was. Outskirts (2) - I don't think I replayed a level more than this one. Great balance of stealth, close quarters, sniping, and vehicle combat. Not to mention endless hours outside of the map. Almost have to pair Metropolis with this one, but Outskirts outshines for me. The Ark (3) - The flight in and music paired set the epic tone of this mission. Then you hop off and a marine comments about looking at your home galaxy in the sky. Love it. Stealth to full vehicle onslaught. FuD's landing. Tank beats everything. A sentinel army appearing at the end. The beginning of the end. Halo (1) - I lied. I did play one level more than outskirts. So much fun. Seeing how long you could hide from the first drop ship. Trying to keep Johnson alive the whole mission. Trying to keep a sniper in your passenger seat. Taking the hog to the top of the rock formation and clearing that portion in minutes. The mission that started it all for me."

The first real exposition of the Forerunners, with multiple memorable sections, like the beach rush, the encounter with the Zealot at the end, the camo elites at the end, etc. The pacing of this level was wonderful and is a good example of backtracking done right.

From there, I would suggest moving on to Halo: First Strike, Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, and then to the Kilo Five Trilogy, as those books continue on the story set by Halo: The Fall of Reach.   If you're interested in the background of Halo 4, I would recommend reading the Forerunner Saga for information on the Didact, the Librarian, and the last days of the Forerunner-Flood War. If you're really interested in reading some extra material about the series in general, you can read Halo: Contact Harvest, Halo: The Cole Protocol, and Halo: Broken Circle.

HaloStory,3c7axt,Zeal0tElite,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:17 2015 UTC,Especially with Grunt Birthday on.   Bang yay!!!
HaloStory,3c7axt,ChurchBrimmer,16,Mon Jul 6 07:20:29 2015 UTC,I learned to respect Unggoy after reading Contact Harvest. Dadab's interaction with others of his kind really show how they can be much more unique than one would expect. Dadab is probably my favorite character in the universe outside the games.  I hope to see some more characteization of their race outside of just being cowardly and useless. Their story shown in the H2A terminal about the rebellion showed a braver side of them.
HaloStory,3c7axt,Blackhound118,14,Sun Jul 5 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"I had a similar reaction to reading about Yapyap in The Flood. It was very interesting to read about how the grunts aren't just dumb, blindly faithful cannon fodder for the Covenant. They actually have the capacity to be very intelligent and clever. Makes them a lot more likable in my view."
HaloStory,3c7axt,GoldPilot,13,Sun Jul 5 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"I kinda respect all the tragedy that goes into their lore. They were on the edge of extinction before being brutally subjugated, then when they revolted for being treated horribly, they were beaten into bloody submission. It's hard being a grunt."
HaloStory,3c7axt,StraightRidahs,13,Sun Jul 5 19:54:18 2015 UTC,Halo 2 grunts were absolutely adorable.
HaloStory,3c7axt,darth_taco_117,9,Sun Jul 5 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"They should return the suicide grunts from wars back into another Halo game. This time, a little tougher than the regulars so that you're having a hard time as it charges at you."
HaloStory,3c7axt,Zeal0tElite,7,Sun Jul 5 19:50:38 2015 UTC,Like dedicated ones instead of just pulling out two grenades?
HaloStory,3c7axt,darth_taco_117,4,Sun Jul 5 21:37:18 2015 UTC,Exactly.
HaloStory,3c7axt,Fifth5Horseman,7,Sun Jul 5 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"One thing I always found interesting about the grunts is a small piece of dialogue from the Prophet of Mercy to Thel Vadam'ee, just before Thel puts on the Arbiter's armor for the first time. Mercy's talking about previous Arbiters, and in the same breath he mentions, ""...the Taming of the Hunters, the Grunt Rebellions..."" as examples of crises within the Covenant that required an Arbiter.   I just think it's neat that 'Grunt Rebellions' was in the same league as 'the Taming of the Hunters'. I imagine it was no small feat to just 'tame' the Hunters, so it's cool that the Grunts can present the same level of threat if they get out of line. It made the whole Covenant seem more... tentatively balanced, I guess."
HaloStory,3c7axt,Metagenic,9,Mon Jul 6 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"The Grunts have the highest reproduction rate and are the ones doing all the slave labor. When astronomical numbers of slaves walk out of their jobs and start a violent rebellion, you don't just have to deal with them as a military force, you have to deal with the economic and societal backlash as well. Kind of like how the American South's economy was left in shambles after the North blockaded their ports and freed the slaves, their primary source of agricultural labor."
HaloStory,3c7axt,ThePencilMan,3,Mon Jul 6 02:34:27 2015 UTC,You know there were terminals in Halo 2 Anniversary that cover both of those events.  Here's a link to a YouTube video of the Taming of the Hunters terminal.  Here's one for the Grunt Rebellion terminal.

HaloStory,3c6u42,daanish_91,20,Sun Jul 5 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, this issue has already been addressed and solved. The UNSC Pillar of Autumn did indeed intend to leave the Epsilon Eridani system after retrieving John-117 and Linda-058, but Keyes received a message from Dr. Halsey to return planetside to rendezvous with NOBLE Team and pick up Cortana's split half. He had the ship turned back and docked at the Aszòd Shipyards to wait for NOBLE Team to deliver their package."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,9,Sun Jul 5 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's the common theory, but it isn't a perfect reconciliation. The timestamps in The Fall of Reach don't allow for this. The explanation only works if you ignore (retcon) the final timestamp in the book.  Granted, this is the explanation I subscribe to, but it really isn't ""official"" until someone comments on the timestamps."
HaloStory,3c6u42,Defguru,5,Sun Jul 5 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"I can't think of anything else that makes sense, so I'll just stick to this explanation unless 343 Industries decides to add to the reconciliation between The Fall of Reach and Halo: Reach."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,2,Sun Jul 5 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not trying to talk you down from the explanation. It is the only thing that makes sense. I just think it's important to mention that it isn't ""official."""
HaloStory,3c6u42,Defguru,4,Sun Jul 5 15:11:50 2015 UTC,Thanks. I just wish we got an explanation as to how Keyes got the call to return to Reach to pick up Cortana's fragment other than a passing comment he made to SPARTAN-B312.
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:17:58 2015 UTC,Agreed.
HaloStory,3c6u42,Defguru,2,Sun Jul 5 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"Hope its a chance for further media. Maybe a short or something like that. But really love how much 343 try to expand the lore, and the universe."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,2,Sun Jul 5 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification. Any links or references for this? I'm guessing it would've been part of the game's limited edition stuff.   Yet to read First Strike and Flood which might explain how Red Team got out, but this retcon again makes you think why Red Team weren't asked to rendezvous at Aszòd for extraction. Maybe they were just on a different part of the planet."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,9,Sun Jul 5 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, some of this information is coming from the top of my head. If I recall correctly, Captain Keyes mentions to SPARTAN-B312 that Dr. Halsey assured him of NOBLE Team's effectiveness and that they could successfully deliver Cortana's fragment to him. Keyes retrieving Cortana from SPARTAN-B312 occurred after extracting the SPARTAN-IIs from GAMMA Station though, as the extraction took place around 06:37 and NOBLE Team arrives at Aszòd at 16:52.  Red Team was probably too far away and too isolated to rendezvous with the Pillar of Autumn at the shipyard. The Covenant had pretty much surrounded Aszòd and blocked off all ground and air routes to the shipyards, so getting there would be nigh impossible. Red Team pretty much was out of contact with the rest of the UNSC at this point."
HaloStory,3c6u42,TheEld,4,Sun Jul 5 12:57:56 2015 UTC,"Wish Bungie would've put more effort into reconciling the two story arcs. There's another oddity from FoR where Halsey is addressing the Spartans on Reach at the auditorium of the training complex. It says all Spartans were over there, but that would also mean Jorge wasn't with NOBLE team."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,5,Sun Jul 5 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"Not all the SPARTAN-IIs were present for the briefing of Operation: RED FLAG. Dr. Halsey actually knew this. She wrote in her journal about how guilty she felt lying to the SPARTANs present that every living member of the program was assembled in there. She also listed the SPARTANs who were missing from the briefing, including Jorge."
HaloStory,3c6u42,xuylittle,3,Sun Jul 5 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"All right. So the three engaged in combat would be the Spartans on Spirit of Fire, three KIA would be Sam, Solomon and Arthur, and the one wounded to continue active duty would be Jorge. Not sure if Randall defected earlier than this or during 2552. So now it makes sense. Thanks!"
HaloStory,3c6u42,rutger11b,3,Sun Jul 5 14:12:49 2015 UTC,Randall went MIA in 2532.
HaloStory,3c6u42,Kelsig,4,Sun Jul 5 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"And the SPARTAN-II that was wounded in action was Maria-062, not Jorge. Jorge just was not present during the briefing.   Also don't forget about Grey Team. They're currently out of contact with the rest of the UNSC, most likely still completing their missions assigned to them by ONI. They were not available for the briefing as well."
HaloStory,3c6g5c,Receptron,29,Sun Jul 5 07:41:42 2015 UTC,The Keyes loop. Particularly Keyes' interaction with Jaggers. Nylund has such a way to make you visualise intergalactic battles.

HaloStory,3c6g5c,Defguru,11,Sun Jul 5 15:05:20 2015 UTC,Red Team fighting the Elites at the Apex while Sergeant Forge fought the Arbiter. Such an epic scene.
HaloStory,3c6g5c,_Qilby,11,Sun Jul 5 15:04:53 2015 UTC,"On a hillside near the portal to the Ark, Marines and Naval personnel gather. Lord Hood removes his cap, and begins his speech.  Admiral Hood: ""For us, the storm has passed... the war is over. But let us never forget those who journeyed into the howling dark and did not return. For their decision required courage beyond measure; sacrifice, and unshakable conviction that their fight... our fight, was elsewhere. As we start to rebuild, this hillside will remain barren, a memorial to heroes fallen. They ennobled all of us, and they shall not be forgotten.""  Admiral Hood puts his cap back on, and salutes.  Gunnery Sergeant Pete Stacker: ""Present arms!""  Seven Marines, standing in a line, draw their battle rifles and fire three volleys in unison, a three-volley salute to the fallen. The sound of the shots echo through Mount Kilimanjaro. The panorama changes as the Marines fire each shot.  {sunset}  Admiral Hood: (To Thel 'Vadam) ""I remember how this war started. What your kind did to mine. I can't forgive you. But... (he holds out his hand) you have my thanks, for standing by him to the end.""  Thel shakes Admiral Hood's hand.  Admiral Hood: ""Hard to believe he's dead.""  The Arbiter looks away, toward the Shadow of Intent, hovering silently in the sky.  Arbiter: ""Were it so easy...""  This scene. This is one of the most emotional scenes in any form of media ever for me. Especially when we thought that this was the end. That John's story was over. It was the perfect send off. Next in line has to be Cortana's death. But this will always stick with me."

Arbiter is pretty insightful. Also, it was likely a throwback to the beginning of the game when John points a pistol at Arbiter and Johnson says ""Come on now, we got enough to worry about without you two trying to kill each other."" John tightens his grip on Arbiter, and Arbiter replies to Johnson ""Were it so easy."""

HaloStory,3c6g5c,hypobonix,7,Sun Jul 5 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Here are some of my favourite chilling moments in Halo. I'll only include one from each game since there are too many moments in various games, books, music, and other media to include here.  Halo Combat Evolved's ending cutscene, as the camera spans from the cockpit of the Longsword to a view of the Milky Way Galaxy, with Dust and Echoes playing. Dust and Echoes is one of the most underrated songs in Halo, another being Insignificantia.  Halo 2: Delta Halo opening. That is another Halo.  Halo 3's ending: Lord Hood shakes hands with the Arbiter and the Elites depart Earth, plus the credits song Roll Call and Bungie's thanks to the players. Were it so easy...  Halo 3: ODST drop sequence.  Halo Wars the cutscene where Ripa 'Moramee abducts Anders and the Spartans are late to the scene. So many badasses in the same scene. Why don't we put the lady down and talk about this man to freak!  Halo Reach: The elite zealots ambush Noble Team. One of the rare scenes where the Covenant and Human forces are evenly matched and both are clearly defensive, since neither really has the upper hand.  The Didact's speech in Halo 4 post credits scene. I've never been a fan of the Forerunners but this is chilling and great."
HaloStory,3c6g5c,vincemisfit,6,Sun Jul 5 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"The part of Halo Reach when you're down to 3 Spartans, then it's just 2 if you, and when you're all alone, it just gives me goosebumps because you know your whole team is dead and you're gonna get fucked no matter how hard you fight."
HaloStory,3c6g5c,Metlman13,6,Sun Jul 5 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"There is so much to talk about. I'm sure thet if you asked a month ago my answer would have changed. I'll take a moment from each FPS because I've never played Halo Wars (but I still know it well). I've read 6-7 books but I tend to forget the exact moments, so I will not talk about them. Note that I started playing Halo when 3 came out:  TL/DR:  CE : Ending cutscene ""The Pilar of Autumn""  2 : The Great Journey cutscene, Arbiter still trying to make Tartarus understand what really are the rings.  3 : Floodgate's ending cutscene.  ODST : Coastal Highway mission  Reach : Jorge's death  4 : Chief reaction during Cortana's last moments  Halo CE: The final cutscene of the first mission. Droping onto a Halo, with no idea of what it is, with the Autumn going past you and with one of the most awesome themes of the series (Brothers In Arms - Follow Our Brothers) is pretty stunning.  Halo 2: The problem with that game is that I've never really played it before the MCC so I (even if I knew it perfectly because, you know, gotta ba a harcore fan) so I am not emotionaly attached to it. The cutscene in which Arby and Johnson talk to Tartarus and try to open his eyes is faboulus. When he says “Tartarus, stop. Put down the Icon.”, he sounds like he will forget Tartarus everything if he opens his eyes.  Halo 3: Oh boy... If I didn't choose to only talk about one component, I would have taken every cutscene... But let's stick to the rules. A whole lot of emotions go trhough music and this is one of the reasons I've loved Halo. Floodgate's ending cutscene is breathtaking. Once again, the theme is Follow Our Brothers. This cutscene is absoloutely gorgeous. Seeing Humans and Elites go together into absolute darkness is fantastic.  Halo 3 ODST: This whole game is a piece of art. Chilling in the city wins. Two other moments that don't occur ""in"" the city and ""at"" night are still fantastic (Dropping cutscene - Coastal Highway's mission). I've got to admit that the intro cutscene is amazing. But the last mission of the game is so well constructed that it wins for me. During your journey around the city, you get to drive more and more powerful vehicles, and a sense of achievement comes from that. All of it until the moment when a carier comes in the city and starts glassing it. All of this happens with Buck almost losing his shit ""Damn it, no! They're gonna burn this city and then glass the whole planet! Covenant bastards! It's just like Reach all over again!"" and with one of the best OSTs in your hears.  Halo Reach: This game is the thing that is the closest to a movie. At the end of Night Of Sollace the games hits a turning point and you can sense how futile and hopeless it is to fight. Jorge's death is that moment. This is probably the moment in the franchise that explain how much the Covenant - Human war never really was a war to start with. With the original trilogy, you never feel outmatched by the covies, in reach you totally do.  Halo 4: Even if it seems to easy to choose that moment, I cried at Cortana's death. It was not beacause of the death itself, but because Chief's denial ""No, you're not, you're coming with me"" is heartbreaking. As much as I hated 4 for it's lack of fun and competitiveness, the story was pretty good.  Of course al of these moments are part of a huge amout of moments that make me love Halo. Forgetting the others wouldn't be fair, and I will never forget. No pun intended"

Seeing the glassing of New Alexandria from the same game. The beams sound from a distance like the roar of an angry beast, and it rattles everything around.  Wandering alone in occupied New Mombasa at night in ODST. It actually got me into cyberpunk, and its a very different take on Halo.  The final stand of the Covenant in Halo 3. Its possibly one of the greatest in-game battles of the whole series."

HaloStory,3c6crl,Defguru,6,Sun Jul 5 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think the animals were grown specifically by Tragic Solitude after John fired Installation 04B and severely damaged the Lesser Ark.  It was either Usze or N'tho who specifically told Luther that they hadn't seen any wildlife during the Battle of Installation 00.  I took that to mean there were no animals present during that time, and that 000TS created them from DNA samples that were indexed somewhere on the Ark.  Especially with how 000TS was able to control them, they must have been created and grown once he decided to act against Humanity and the Samgheili."
HaloStory,3c6crl,Master_Chief_71,2,Sun Jul 5 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"When Chief fired the ring it devoid the Ark of all sentient life and flood biomass. When it comes to ambient, non sentient life, HitD makes it seem like they aren't affected by the Halo effect and are similarly immune to flood infection due to their lack of sentience; but as well, the book also says in passing that all of those creatures were released by the ring firing."
HaloStory,3c6crl,MendicantBerger,3,Sun Jul 5 16:15:36 2015 UTC,Tragic Solitude or Something Depressing as I nicknamed him. I would love if Luther replaced Glassmen in halo 5.
HaloStory,3c6crl,wildedge,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough the main issue I had with the story was Luther and some of his actions.  Singing to flying alien whales? WTF is this? Cinderella? Get serious.   On that note, Vale had a magical animal moment like this with the Blind Wolves also. ""Shh everyone! This alien species we've never encountered before is obviously tracking us by sound. Hopefully they don't rip us to shreds since I've magically convinced you all to not shoot them!"". It was just hard to swallow.   Back to Luther. Luther is described as this quiet, not extremely sociable scientist guy. Then BAM! He's magically a bad ass and a perfect marksman even under extreme pressure? I mean, yeah I get that he went to the Firing Range with his Dad, but with no formal training on keeping calm during life or death situations, it just seemed unbelievable, again.   Other than these three really goofy and awkward situations(and a few lore issues like you mention), I thought the book was good."
HaloStory,3c6crl,Kody_Z,2,Mon Jul 6 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"I just finished this book last night. I was really disappointed. The whole thing came across as low effort and unimaginitive.  I agree with your point about Luther and his childhood. It was an interesting perspective. Unfortunately that was about the only depth given to a character in the book. I guess Kodiak had his arm cut off and had a reason to create a little dramatic tension with the Sanghelli. The rest of the characters felt pretty cardboard to me.   Without any real character development, the book came across as more of an action report. First this happened, then this happened, etc. Some things seemed like they were just thrown in there. For instance, Kodiak left his group to go fight a tree creature. Despite being told by the others of the danger that was there, he just walked up to it and got attacked. The whole sequence seemed so stupid and pointless. And since I am already bitching about it, sentient tree creatures? Seriously. The Halo universe now has sentient tree creatures? Lame.  Another pointless segment was when they cut to Captain Richards in the med bay on the Mayhem. What was the point of that? Was that there to show that the Covenant had fancy medical technology? I get that we had to check in with her again at some point since she was in charge, but it seemed pointless.  The thing with Bobby. Were we supposed to care? If so then he should have spent at least a few pages setting up some sort of relationship, or adding some depth to either character. At that point in the book I still didn't care at all about Kodiak, and certainly didn't care at all about Bobby. Oh no, you got turned into some sort of grotesque monster machine. Maybe it's because you surrendered to the enemy you pussy.  The Flood thing seemed about right. Chief had fired a Halo ring into the Ark, so it is not surprising that there was no Flood. What was surprising, however that there was any life of any kind present. The Halo blasts destroy living matter. Why there was anything left is beyond me.  I liked a lot of the Halo novels, but this one was just disappointing. It seemed very amateurish. If it didn't have the Halo name on it, it would already have been forgotten by time. I read it because I want to be up on all the Halo lore for the launch of Halo 5, but I'm pissed that I wasted $11 on it. If this is a harbinger of what's to come with new Halo stuff, then I'll just get the major plot points on the internet and call it good."

HaloStory,3c6crl,Grim-Enigma,3,Mon Jul 6 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"The reason Zeta Halo was different from the rest of the rings was because it was part of the original Halo Array that consisted of 12 rings at 30,000 km each. In Halo: Primordium, the Iso-Didact makes the ring lose a lot of mass because it was severely damaged.   I'm not sure why the ring didn't have a monitor. The original caretaker was Mendicant Bias, but he was stopped and removed from the ring by the Iso-Didact. It's possible that the ring either never received a new caretaker, the one there hid from the Humans like Tragic Solitude did, or perhaps the monitor just disappeared like 049 Abject Testament did on Installation 03."

HaloStory,3c4fiv,Metagenic,2,Sun Jul 5 06:11:17 2015 UTC,"Flood are different from most other zombie infections. They take the knowledge of the one the infect and add it to the collective. All the knowledge of guns, locations, first kiss, even hiw to drive a starship; everything is now with the Flood.   Ammunition/energy as well are and issue. How many bullets do you think it's takes to take down a single combat form? 15-20? That times.. idk maybe 500 in on a star ship? A couple million on a colony.. supplies would run out. (Not sure what covenant weapons do to recharge but I feel like they'd have a worse problem since in game you can't recharge it in the field; so you drop it.)   Also because it's a videogame. You can't expect to have people buy a game that's just dread and constant losing with no hope of ever beating it... wait.. isn't Dark Souls a thing? Anyway; you catch my drift? It's made easier in game so you can beat it, whereas in reality you'd become ""Food and nothing more."""
HaloStory,3c4fiv,FishFlies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is, in order for the Flood to be able to apply their newly acquired knowledge, they need to have amassed a sizable infection already, right? I just find it hard to believe that professional military operations such as the UNSC, Covenant, and even the Forerunners and ancient humans could have such spectacular firepower and yet still be unprepared or incompetent enough that they'd let mere infection forms take over enough individuals to conquer entire battleships and planets.   And for ordinary combat forms, don't you really only need to pop the infection form in its chest to take it down? It doesn't sound like too much of a task if the personnel are trained for such a situation. You would only have to fight hundreds of Flood on a ship or millions in a colony if the first people to succumb, let's say the first ten percent or something like that, weren't doing their jobs right."
HaloStory,3c4fiv,Metagenic,4,Sun Jul 5 11:44:33 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that in every in counter with the Flood in universe has been the first time for each civilization.   Ancient humans had it develope on them, and they then began glassing it from orbit. They didn't warn the Forerunners, and they got blindsided by the parasite and since they had no idea what it was or what it could do; they sent in fleets and armies after it, which were then eaten. Due to conflicts with the humans, and internal strife, the Forerunners were weak and the Flood was the final straw that broke the camels back.  Had it been that the Forerunners were at peak strength, the Flood wouldn't have been a problem.   As for the ""modern"" times; both sides (Human and Covenant) were drowning in each other's blood. By the time the Covenant opened pandora box, both sides were severely low on troops. This and the fact that both sides have never seen the Flood before, plus they hated eachother so much they all but ignored the Flood until it was to late and it began its hive mind on Truth and Reconsiliation. When the covenant had released the flood, all it had to do was get off of Halo and it had unimaginable hosts to take. A fresh battlefield before a covenant glassing? Sounds delicious to them.  As for your question, yes. A general chest shot should do it easily, and everyone who goes into the armed forces gets trained to shoot center mass; it wouldn't be that hard to quickly dispose of them, at first. But in battle everything gets harder to do. Not to mention the fear and anxiety from even seeing one of them could make even the most seasoned rifleman shakey."
HaloStory,3c4fiv,FishFlies,3,Sun Jul 5 12:05:39 2015 UTC,"I like that explanation. You're right in that the major outbreaks all happened when two factions were already fighting each other. Seems like ancient humanity did a good job of screwing themselves and everyone else by failing to inform the Forerunners of the true threat until it was too late.   And yeah, I just reread Mona Lisa. A lot of the time, the combat forms went down so slowly because the marines were running and gunning and losing accuracy in the process, or too terrified to hold their guns straight. Hopefully that'll change in the future now that the UNSC has simulators that can account for Flood combatants."

HaloStory,3c4fiv,Toasiddy,37,Sat Jul 4 19:33:43 2015 UTC,"After reading The Mona Lisa, it really impresses on you just how horrific they are. I feel like a horror game involving a group of Marines (or hey, why not Covies) attempting to escape a Flood-infested ship would be fantastic. Low lighting, no motion trackers, limited ammo - you have to keep your wits about and improvise. Get some welding torches to burn/dismember the Flood, or rig a makeshift flamethrower out of a dead Grunt's methane tank, stuff like that."

Usually the host dies when a Flood form takes over but Jenkins survived, meaning he had to watch as the Flood took control of his body. He had to experience all the pain of the infection breaking and reshaping his bones, shifting his organs, tearing his skin. Then had to watch while his own infected body attempted to tear apart his friends and fellow marines.

HaloStory,3c4qor,anormalgeek,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"In a way, you could also argue the Flood is doing the same thing. Essentially, the Flood seeks to create an organic ascension of sorts. Trillions of nodes under the control of a hive mind consume all available resources, thereby creating an organic superintelligence that might rival that of a non-organic, post-singularity civilization. When you take this into consideration, the Halo mythos, as a whole, is really about choice between several different paths of ascension, and the conflict that these choices inevitably create.   So yeah. The Flood are just one way of accomplishing it.    I don't believe biological diversity is the focus of the mantle though.    It's not. It's about the preservation and guidance of life itself. How you actually go about that is the real question. A long time ago I wrote about how Halo 4 and onwards is really the story of humanity attaining the mantle and as more and more information comes out the more I feel that theory is correct.  It really makes me question where the didact plays into this though. I feel like him and the warden eternal would conflict with one another."

I'm curious to see humanitys' technological capabilities at the time the Flood return. I imagine Halo 6/7 having humans with far more advanced armor and weapons, to combat the Flood."
HaloStory,3c4qor,HvkS7n,3,Sun Jul 5 01:02:30 2015 UTC,I don't think the solution to the Flood is brute force. The ancient Humans and Forerunners both tried that and failed.

They then took this third of the human population and allowed the Flood to consume them. The new genes, it was believed, aggressively killed off Flood biomatter and destroyed the Flood until the few that survived were forced to escape. They would not reappear for another 9,000 years. In truth, however, the Flood had not been defeated. Rather, they willingly retreated, as humanity was an essential part of the Flood's overall plan to destroy the Forerunners.

Also, what if the Reclaimer Saga ended with MC having to fire the rings?  Maybe then we have a few years of spinoffs like ODST and Reach, and then the next Halo game comes out and its a new version of humanity, set years and years after the firing.

A good example on real life parallel evolution are the similarities between placentals and marsupials.   So that said, assuming the Precursors were the creators of life in the galaxy it would make sense that in their engineering of life; if a design proved to work extremely well on one planet, engineering an analogous structure could work well for life on another planet.    This isn't directed at you, but my biggest grip with the life transplantation trope is that all multi cellular organisms really a rather large amount of proteins and lipids and nucleic acids to function.  Not all molecules of these groups are compatible in environments in which all life shares a common ancestor (try eating  anything toxic).  So completely uplifting a species from one planet and putting it on another without any sort other forms of support is rather ridiculous in my mind."

They're an intermediary kind of force that's not really going anywhere or doing anything, they've got no purpose.  On reflection though, that's not really anything to do with the Three Vectors, there's not really any society to bring down with the Kig-Yar since they're driven by the self rather than the group.

She isn't as heartless as she makes others seem, all of the Spartans are her children, and she hates herself for taking their lives away from them."
HaloStory,3by0ea,DrummerBoy2999,8,Fri Jul 3 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Halsey knows that the average life expectancy of an AI is 7 years and by the beginning of Halo 4 Cortana was around 8 years old. If she knew the UNSC had recovered Chief when she got upset about his well being in Spartan Ops, she probably thought they would have decommissioned Cortana when they found them."
HaloStory,3by0ea,scoobythebeast,12,Fri Jul 3 12:00:25 2015 UTC,"Cortana was made from a flash-clone of Halsey's brain. I'm pretty sure Halsey is at least concerned about her.

HaloStory,3by0ea,LordMegatron586,4,Fri Jul 3 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"She would have to be aware that rampancy was a concern, as Cortana would have been 8 at the time of her death. Halsey may have assumed that she would be destroyed/decommissioned by the UNSC, or already had been.   Edit: also, if she assumed chief was dead after halo 3, Cortana would be presumed dead with her. Her survival would likely be considered secondary to John's."
HaloStory,3by0ea,B1GTOBACC0,4,Fri Jul 3 05:37:36 2015 UTC,"Would Halsey even know that Cortana survived Halo 2? Unless she was briefed on the fact that High Charity landed on the Ark and Master Chief went in to find her, she really has no way of knowing Cortana and John ever reunited, right?"
HaloStory,3by0ea,Cabbaggio,4,Fri Jul 3 06:05:14 2015 UTC,"There's a few sections about AI theory and variations including ways to combat rampancy inside Halsey's Journal (came with an edition of Halo reach) and if I remember correctly, Halsey had written that she thought Cortana and other AIs based on human brains would be better equipped to delay and deal with rampancy but she couldn't know for sure.  I'd say it's a good bet to say that in the back of her mind, she still thinks that Cortana might be ""alive"" somewhere."
HaloStory,3by0ea,spartanatreyu,3,Fri Jul 3 08:30:26 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to metastability? IIRC this requires a sufficiently powerful host system (think planetwide) to get past the Jealousy stage of rampancy. Considering any SmartAI has an estimated life of seven years (shorter if sufficient trauma is inflicted, such as a Gravemind), Cortana has lasted much longer than she should have. Also considering Cortana was based off of a purposely disfigured Halsey clone, one that was designed to have more brain power at the expense of other functions, could this have an impact on her actual (not estimated) life expectancy?"
HaloStory,3by0ea,MilhouseJr,3,Fri Jul 3 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"Based on the brief look at the mocap scenes being acted out for Halo 5 with Halsey, Palmer and Lasky I think its safe to assume she not only cares about her but is worried about her well being and state."

HaloStory,3by0ea,retardedchicken5a,2,Mon Jul 6 00:21:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Halsey has never really seen smart AIs as real people and has run experiments on them that killed them with no remorse. If I recall correctly she once casually killed one of akerson's or someone else's AIs that was spying on her, though I could have just made that up. Maybe she cares about Cortana but I dont think it's as a person and more so as a loyal pet.

HaloStory,3bvi8s,JacksonSX35,12,Thu Jul 2 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, Firefight was before multiplayer was given a canon explanation.  The Spartan IVs, as far as we know, are the first to make use of holographic training simulations.  As such, any multiplayer experience before their time isn't canon (though the maps are indeed War Games maps).  However, the holographic simulators can produce simulations of enemies like the Covenant, giving Spartans the ability to fight against AI combatants (known modes allowing this are Warzone and Invasion).  A Firefight-like mode is more than likely in use by the Spartan IVs."
HaloStory,3bvi8s,TheNerdyOne_,17,Thu Jul 2 15:11:50 2015 UTC,They incorporated War Games into the lore after games that had Firefight. Spartan Ops was the answer to that.
HaloStory,3bvi8s,FullplateHero,7,Thu Jul 2 15:01:23 2015 UTC,War Games only makes Halo 4 multiplayer canon. All other games multiplayer modes are still non-canon.

I don't think people fully understand how ridiculously good of a training tool it is. It's nothing that the II's or III's had access to. I'm guessing Roland is running them too, they never see the same thing twice.   Plus, they can specifically train for a mission. Roland can replicate the site based of intel. They have already been to the place over and over for the real mission and fought against the expected enemy strength, this is HUGE. Roland probably even makes them harder and smarter for the training missions, so they are prepared for everything."

Indeed, a valid argument could be made against misuse of time and resources in Halo 4's development.

HaloStory,3bvz75,Toa_Freak,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm I see, yea I was confusing that. However, DNA dictates neural structure, doesn't it?"
HaloStory,3bvz75,Toa_Freak,3,Thu Jul 2 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. DNA will dictate the formation of the brain and some of the very basic neural structures, but most of the neuron connections in the brain are built up over time, as we gain new memories, learn new skills, etc. It's possible that that a geas could have some sort of influence on the formation of these neural structures, thus allowing some sort of gei transfer during the creation of an AI. However, we've not seen any evidence. This is why I noted ""as far as we know"" in my previous post."

Just a genuine curiosity since Cortana is unlike any other AI ever created. Clearly it would have been unintentional per Halsey, but in my constant ponderment of what the Librarian's full plan is, I can't help but wonder if she did intend on Cortana's creation and the passing on of a geas to an AI to help MC.   Then again, those who have a geas have memories of past lives come back to them when exposed to specific stimuli, right? Has Halsey had such revelations? For that matter, has the Chief??"
HaloStory,3bvz75,anormalgeek,5,Thu Jul 2 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to come off as ""trying to force this to work.""

I can't help but wonder if she did intend on Cortana's creation and the passing on of a geas to an AI to help MC.   Given her lines in Halo 4, it certainly seems that the Librarian seeded the creation of Cortana (never mind that it doesn't make a lot of sense, but I digress). Now, if she intended for some of Halsey's geas to pass to Cortana is another matter, it is possible. As I mentioned, DNA can have some influence on the formation on neurons, though generally not too much, as I understand it. Still, it's possible that the Librarian could have left some genetic instructions to create certain neural connections that would lead to a particular behavior in the right conditions that would have been transferred to Cortana.   Then again, those who have a geas have memories of past lives come back to them when exposed to specific stimuli, right? Has Halsey had such revelations? For that matter, has the Chief??   No and no, as far as we know. That could always change, but given what we saw in Primordium, it seemed like such things were the exception, rather than the rule, concerning ancestral memories."

HaloStory,3bw8l4,sombraptor,5,Fri Jul 10 02:21:42 2015 UTC,"This idea has already happened in the games. To collect the IWHBYD skull in Halo 3, you have to jump through holographic Halos to change the ambient music of the level. Jumping through the hoops in the order of the first eight notes of the Halo choir will spawn the skull at the end of the level.  Whether the mechanic will return, probably not. It's convoluted and not that obvious unless you know what to listen for. IIRC the skull was discovered through datamining the game."

What pisses people off is that she disregarded established mannerisms and behaviours and attitudes and basically had everyone on the ""DAE Halsey is Hitler!?!?"" Wagon. It made no sense.   Going from FoR to Flood to FS to GoO has this commonality. A sense of continuity. It flows nicely despite being from different authors and different settings. All those books before K5 respect what happened before and carry on the same tone for the characters and their development.   K5 shits all over established ideas and traits and behaviours for characters and goes in completely different and stupid directions.   Even the Forerunner books came across in a way that made me think they fit in this exist in universe despite having completely different perspectives.   K5 didn't, it felt like the pessimistic ramblings of a jaded teenager with a metric ton of angst and edge."

HaloStory,3bvm0x,Bearded_Vengeance,4,Thu Jul 2 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. I really found myself loving some of the characters and caring about the outcome, and there's some important lore in there too for Halo 4 and 5.

That being said, I personally enjoyed the trilogy greatly.  While some aspects of the writing are rightly criticized, I found the rest of it very enthralling.    It also bridges the gap between Halo 3 and 4, giving backstory to things like the Infinity and the Spartan Ivs.  It also continues the story of Ghosts of Onyx, which I found greatly satisfying."

HaloStory,3bu2gn,Cheesewithmold,2,Fri Jul 3 17:58:42 2015 UTC,The fantastic thing about Halo music (and any game or movie music that one loves) is that we can associate epic (sad? chill?) moments of the game with the sound itself. That is why it never gets old.

It was when he was pissed about being the trainer for the SPTARTAN-II program, how he felt sick about it. He then mentioned something about Halsey and Keyes having Miranda as their daughter. Won't spoil the rest of it unless you want to know more, but that pretty much confirmed it for me about their relationship."

HaloStory,3bujy0,bigboidabs22,8,Thu Jul 2 07:12:54 2015 UTC,"There is actually a very handy (and quite good) guide to all the Halo books in the sidebar with release order, chronological order and recommended order.  I'd personally recommend Eric Nylund's books first (Fall of Reach, First Strike and Ghosts of Onyx) and the Forerunner Saga (Cryptum, Primordium and Silentium) as must reads. Both trilogies are very strong, although Primordium can be a bit of a chore to read at points.  The Cole Protocol, New Blood, Broken Circle and Hunters in the Dark are also good, but second tier to the above books. Each of them is kind of a self-contained story as well.  Contact Harvest has a lot of cool information about the start of the Human-Covenant war but it's....kind of awkwardly written. I don't know how to be more specific than that.  I have very strong opinions about the Kilo-5 trilogy (Glasslands,  The Thursday War and Mortal Dictata but I'll do my best to be sort-of neutral here; It's a trilogy of books that has some interesting stuff (moral ramifications of the Spartan-II program, Jackal culture, ONI basically doing whatever they want, all the time) but it's rife with errors, retcons and character assassinations. I'd recommend them as bargain bin books, nothing more.  I'm less qualified to talk about the comics, as I've only read the Halo Graphic Novel and Escalation  The Halo Graphic Novel is pretty good; Short and sweet, just a couple of very well illustrated stories from the Halo universe.  Escalation is much more hit and miss. Some arcs are pretty good, others not so much. The art is generally pretty bad. There are some character introductions and events that pave the way for Halo 5, so there probably worth a read.  edit: Oops. forgot about Evolutions a compilation of short stories that I absolutely recommend."
HaloStory,3bujy0,BraveExpress2,2,Thu Jul 2 07:42:07 2015 UTC,Thank you! Pretty new to this subreddit so I really missed that :/ thanks for the recommendations though I'll check em out!

If you want the smallest list possible, go FoR comics, New Blood, forerunner trilogy, and escalation"

HaloStory,3bubbl,TheGoldlessOne,13,Thu Jul 2 05:26:16 2015 UTC,Not likely. Halo isn't Mass Effect. I don't really see a point to have 2 endings where Locke or Chief die. It would be too much work plus they would have to make one ending canon.
HaloStory,3bubbl,TheRealKidsToday,5,Thu Jul 2 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"Plus everyone would choose the Chief anyway ...  I'd play it a second time picking the 'Locke' choice, but I'd still feel guilty."
HaloStory,3bubbl,tblots4,13,Thu Jul 2 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"I think there's zero chance of that. Alternate choices in games are anathema to its EU. Mass Effect's EU is actually pretty great, but it's extremely limited with what it can do. For Halo, alternate story paths would not work."

HaloStory,3bubbl,Master_Chief_71,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"If the Didact reappears, 343 better have a good explanation in game as to why.  While most of us here know that he's been composed and could likely return as an AI, the casual fan who hasn't read Escalation would have no idea what's going on.  The only ""good"" way I can see his return is as an ancilla that is attempting to control one of the Guardians.  Even then, I don't see the Didact returning as an enemy.  Maybe he will intervene as Locke is about to kill/capture Chief and swat Locke aside using fancy restraint fields like he did to Chief in Halo 4."

Halo is their story, not ours. So the uncertainty of multiple endings is not something I'm confident they could pull off well."

From there, she was able to project a hardlight bubble around the Chief, and supply it with artificial gravity.   Cortana fades away, and the hard light bubble loses energy just as the Mantle's Approach loses structural control of its hard light bonds, destroying the ship, and the power source for the area the cutscene takes place in."

The Covenant War with a shared existential threat is really the only time where humanity could be remotely considered as a united entity.  Otherwise it's just life. In this case, life spreading throughout the galaxy, more contact with more species, and further advancing technology.   And what would happen to the other species of the galaxy?   Ideally there would be some sort of Federation-esque interspecies unity, but the Haloverse tends to not be that ideal."

They could tap neural physics to control Precursor artifacts, control the flood operations on a galactic scale, manipulate slipspace, outclass Metarch-class AI. As far as I know the Graveminds, while formidable, didn't fully reach these capabilities.   Keyminds I think were essentially evolved Graveminds...larger and with far more processing power."
HaloStory,3btowc,sps26,2,Thu Jul 2 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"How does it process power though? You could say our brain is an organic computer so is the keymind just filled with ""brains"" because of all the organisms I has consumed?"

HaloStory,3btowc,TheEld,5,Thu Jul 2 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure they can be separated like that. To be honest this question is kind of complicated to answer. The Gravemind is the consciousness of the entire Flood and originated from that of the Primordial. The 'body' the Gravemind occupies is definitely inferior to that of a Key Mind, but they are like different organs within the same organism. A Gravemind can have multiple bodies, all with the same consciousness (from what we know), which is why you'll see some people call it 'A gravemind' or 'the gravemind'. A Key Mind is just like a further evolution of the Flood, but it still has the same consciousness driving it."
HaloStory,3btowc,tblots4,2,Thu Jul 2 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"I understood it that keyminds WERE graveminds, just in a planet sized physical form.

HaloStory,3bt2fn,Master_Chief_71,18,Wed Jul 1 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The Gravemind is my favorite villain so far.  The ancient powerful enemy trope usually feels worn out to me in scifi settings, but the way the Flood has ""evolved"" with all the extended media over the last few years, has really given the Gravemind a special place for me as a villain.  A close second place goes to the Ur-Didact.  Not so much because he is a villain, but how he became a villain.  Seeing (metaphorically) his fall from Supreme Military Commander of the Forerunner, to exiled/disgraced Warrior-Servant, to full blown madman was done excellently throughout the Forerunner Saga.  It made me actually feel bad for him and his twisted Logic (Plague)."

One of my favorite parts of Silentium was him arguing with Bornstellar and the Librarian, he just sounded so sad and desperate.    Quite possibly be my favorite villain in Halo."

HaloStory,3bt2fn,forgottenduck,13,Fri Jul 3 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"343 Guilty Spark.  His actions throughout the first 3 Halos makes him my favorite villain to hate.  He starts off as this quirky, seemingly benevolent AI, that you meet at a desperate time. It seems like he has all the answers to stopping the flood, but quickly turns on you without a second thought. You can't harm him so it's like he's mocking you just with his presence. The fact that he's seen after the credits humming and floating away unharmed is just the last straw.  Somehow you end up teaming up with him in Halo 3, but of course he turns on you in the control room yet again. Except this time he kills Johnson, easily one of the most entertaining characters in the Halo universe. It was so satisfying to finally bring him down.   He doesn't have the gravitas or presence of villains like Gravemind or the Ur-Didact, but he felt like a more compelling character to me.  Plus it was awesome learning his backstory in the Forerunner trilogy. I almost felt bad for him, but then I remember he killed Johnson."

In Halo 2, he at first comes off as being the reasonable Prophet, one that thinks with a pragmatic state of mind rather than a corrupt mind of a zealot. But then you start seeing him as a deviously smart leader with sinister aims and an end game for almost every situation.  In Halo 3 he just sounds like another prophet in the way he talks and acts.

This ""he just went mad"" or ""he was a closet religious fanatic all along"" is just headcanon to explain the two different characters we have in Halo 2 and 3 due to different writers.

An intelligence that represented the peak of Forerunner knowledge and advancement is sent by its masters to interrogate the leader of the flood collective. Over the course of 43 years, they have their discussions, and very slowly Mendicant Bias' will breaks down and Gravemind eventually manages to successfully convince him to join the flood.  Feeling almost betrayed by the Forerunners, and being fueled with hate by the Gravemind, he destroys the Forerunners and any last chance they might have had to survive the flood. In one spectacular move, he leads a massive assault on the Forerunner capital city, obliterating it with several Halos.  However, his enraged hubris gets the best of him: the Forerunners design another intelligence, Offensive Bias, just to Battle him. In the final great Battle of the Forerunner-Flood War, Offensive Bias gains the upper hand over Mendicant and after the Halos fire, it is clear Offensive is the victor. He triumphantly brings Mendicant back to the Ark as a prisoner, where Mendicant is tried for his crimes and sentenced to an eternity to reflect on his betrayal, and he is split up and sent across the galaxy.  Many millenia later, the Covenant are formed using a part of Mendicant, until they meet humanity and he tells them their beliefs are a lie. He attempts to find other parts of himself, but is effectively imprisoned by the Covenant for over 25 years until the end of the war, when they reach the Ark. Here, reconnected once more as his old self, he states his regret over betraying the Forerunners, and announces to a single human that his allegiance has once again changed and he will help stop the flood.  After the Ark's destruction, he is not heard from again, assumed to have been destroyed. But his old masters still lurk in the shadows of the galaxy, corrupted themselves and waiting for the oppurtunity to strike at Humanity..."

HaloStory,3brb7y,N3Chaos,7,Thu Jul 2 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well, opinions are that, so I won't downvote. But keep in mind that numbers don't always win a fight; Vadum knew that he was the better naval strategist and that Sangheili captains out-performed their Jiralhanae counterparts. Just think if any modern first world country with all of its naval prowess fought a group of pirates with almost no knowledge of the ships and no training in naval warfare. Even one vessel could go through an entire fleet of untrained enemies. Also, the elites (similar to ancient samurai) would never shy away from a fight, in fact an enemy who needed two allies to assist in killing you would make for a very honorable death. Apply this same ideaology to the brutes and elites and you go from having a character who was being foolish to a character who knows his captains won't fail him, seeking the glory and honor that comes from winning a battle at those odds."
HaloStory,3brb7y,Edonculation117,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:42:41 2015 UTC,"I agree number don't always win a fight.  But I don't think the disparity between the Sangheli and the Jiralhanae would be too significant.  The Jiralhanae have been captaining ships from soon after they joined the Covenant and were deliberately promoted by Truth.  These are also Truth best and most loyal forces.  While I do believe the Sangheli would get more out of their ships, I don't think it is enough to counter a 3-1 mismatch in numbers without an actual battle strategy.  Your second point of the honour in the fight is fine, but the Sangheli aren't stupid.  Yes they aren't afraid to die, but going into the battle without any strategy at all is asking to get your arse kicked.  Yes, it would be an honourable death, but the Sangheli need to win the battle.  I just feel the line is slightly out of place.  I have no problem with the sentiment and idea behind what Vadum says.  As you say the Sangheli are the better naval tacticians by far, my point is that we don't see that.  I assume it happens off-screen, but I would much rather have a line like 'Then it is an even fight.  All cruisers target the Carriers.  Burn their mongrel hides!'

HaloStory,3brb7y,In_Medias_Res,13,Wed Jul 1 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"I'll break it down for you.   Resignation is my virtue   The Gravemind is extremely patient and is willing to suffer a momentary lose if it means biding his time to strike back for a later victory.   like water I ebb, and flow   Water ebbs when it is pulled out to sea by the tide, whereas it flows when it is being pushed somewhere, often by gravity. This results in erosion, meaning that the Gravemind is two things: capable of a very long battle of chipping away at its enemies until they are too weak to fight back and that the Gravemind sees itself as part of nature & the universe itself, a holdover from its time as the Precursors.   Defeat is simply the addition of time to a sentence I never deserved   The Gravemind sees its actions (consuming the galaxy to bring order to it) as righteous and good, but realizes that other life sees it as evil. When the Forerunners killed the Precursors, this was the beginning of what they see as a prison sentence, locking them away until they could reform. When they came back as the Flood and by extension the Gravemind, the Forerunners activated the Halos and annihilated most of the Flood, prolonging this sentence by again leaving the Flood powerless. Master Chief destroying High Charity and firing Installation 04B was the third time the Gravemind sees itself as being condemned for an act it does not view as a crime.  In short, the Gravemind feels it has been unjustly persecuted by the rest of the galaxy, but admits that it will accept temporary defeats because so long as even one Flood spore persists, it will always persist and will, one day, return to claim its victory."

HaloStory,3br11q,IAmDashing12,41,Wed Jul 1 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"After the Covenant's disastrous defeat at the Ark, Jiralhanae society splintered among many tribes. Most Jiralhanae returned to Doisac, where they continued to fight among themselves as the species' organization fell apart. Many refused to cease their campaigning against the Sangheili and the two species remained locked in an irregular conflict for years to come. When the remaining San'Shyuum retreated into hiding, the Jiralhanae returned to their primitive, savage nature, allowing the Sangheili to gain the upper hand in battle. A Sangheili shipmaster visiting Kholo noted that at least some Jiralhanae factions had separated from those loyal to the former Covenant and were waging an internecine war against each other. Additionally, due to the Jiralhanae's lack of advanced technology, they were unable to attain resources or even food for themselves, instead resorting to raids on Sangheili settlements. This, in turn, only served to provoke further violence between the two species. There were several Jiralhanae, such as Manus and the crew of Piety, who remained loyal to their Sangheili commanders after the split of the Covenant. Many others served the Sangheili as security guards and servants on Sanghelios. However, this did not come without conflict. In March 2553, Jiralhanae servants in the state of Ontom launched insurgent attacks, which resulted in the death of dozens of Sangheili. Their revolt was quickly quelled by the city militia. At least some Jiralhanae allied with various remnants of the Covenant; some fought on behalf of Merg Vol's forces during the Battle of Draetheus V in 2554, and others fought in the Battle of Installation 03 as part of Jul 'Mdama's Covenant faction in 2557. On March 5, 2558, the Jiralhanae Chieftain Lydus represented a polity of Jiralhanae willing to begin peace talks with Arbiter Thel 'Vadam on Ealen IV. However, initial peace talks were foiled by a mercenary group hired by the human New Colonial Alliance. Hidden in corners throughout the Orion Arm, several Jiralhanae clans continue to gather in strength, continuing the work of the dissolved Covenant."

HaloStory,3br81a,HeyLudaYouLikeToEat,16,Wed Jul 1 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"I hated the Knights in halo 4.  They would retreat and regenerate so much that I would run out of ammo and die. I would then respawn with the same load out and repeat the cycle until I gave up and restarted the level. At least when Elites recharged their sheilds, they didn't teleport across the map."
HaloStory,3br81a,PastelFlamingo150,13,Wed Jul 1 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"They just seem cheap and gimmicky, between watcher revivals and teleportation.

Grunts and crawlers get a headshot, elites need their shield popped, then a headshot, jackals need a hit in the weapon, and a headshot. They also have weapons with a clear and effective use against them. With the knights, it just feels like ""unload everything you have, and hope they don't teleport."" I didn't even notice they have a shield pop animation until someone else pointed it out to me.   What's really surprising is that, despite humans having similar levels of technology during the human/forerunner war, the forerunner weapons are all weak as shit against a shield."
HaloStory,3br81a,B1GTOBACC0,3,Wed Jul 1 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"I found that the best way to deal with them on legendary was to kill everything around them, then sneak up on them and assassinate them. I found trying to shoot them to kill them was a complete waste of bullets. You'd go through half your reserves of AR ammo killing one dude.  Even better way is to not kill them and just run past."
HaloStory,3br81a,monk1junk1,2,Thu Jul 2 03:08:21 2015 UTC,The suppressor actually worked quite well against knights. Certainly better than the AR or SMG ever did against elites. Of course it basically sucked for all other uses so it was rarely worth holding.
HaloStory,3br81a,anormalgeek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the prometheans had no good analog to the plasma pistol, which at first glance seems like a shit weapon, but has excellent utility.

The boltshot had decent secondary utility (moreso in MP than campaign), but when you try to use it, they either warp away, or if you're really unlucky, they're carrying the suppressor."

Then as you said they'd just teleport away, regen shields and leave me royally pissed off.    Its partly why I really dislike Halo 4.  I thought the whole forerunner stuff was over the top and rather stupid.  But story wise it was at least acceptable.  But those knight made the gameplay terrible.  Same goes for the flood.  I can't understand why only ODST and Reach have the covenant as the main enemies.  IMO the inclusion of a third faction to fight has always felt poorly implemented and actually takes away from the story.  But all that really shows is that I'm not a fan of the ancient evil awakens cliches"

Granted, she is smart so winging it works pretty well for her.   ONI is not wrong about Halsey. They hardly need to lie or embellish when it comes to her. Their crime is omitting the part about how she was given total authorization from ONI about every aspect of the program, except the clones. The clones are on her, which is the most fucked up part about the program.  I think Halsey is going to use leverage to force her way back into the good graces of the UNSC so she can get something from them.

Deja replies saying that if Halsey is seem to be too slow with progress towards the S-II program, then ONI would put someone else in charge who cared more about results than about the children.

I personally dislike the kilo-five team created by Traviss; it has a shit name, sanctimonious support characters such as Vaz and Mal, an unstable Spartan II(Naomi) that shouldn't have those unnecessary emotions reflecting her previous life, and a Spartan program washout(Osman) that hates on Halsey.

In Glasslands, Val even mentions how it was impossible for Halsey to run the Spartan program alone, and that every single person should pay for it. He even accuses Mendez of being less than a man. After that everything just disappears though. Mendez doesn't admit that ONI was the one behind everything, hell, Val reads Naomi's file and completely glosses over the ONI logo and authorship.   I do think that the S-IIs will have some feeling reflecting their training, being raised in the military, etc. but not to her extent.

Look at Shakespeare's plays for example. As time goes on and culture changes, new interpretations are gained about the characters and story events and the work is appreciated in a different light.  Using your Star Wars example, it is already similar to a Shakesperian play in that in can be interpreted in many different ways, and has been too. Although I think by the 26th century it would be likely that it is not watched much outside of historical societies and sites dedicated to historical motion pictures, it would still be a common target of film study in colleges.  As far as classical music, there are a few listeners if Halsey proves anything, but it is far from a popular form of music, mostly because the general public is unaware of it or simply doesn't care.  How would the Covenant react upon hearing human music? Well, if it were symphonies, they might pause and listen a little bit before continuing their destruction, gaining a little more insight about the culture they are dedicated to eradicating. Basically, it boils down to them still seeing humans as vermin, but still having a bit of appreciation for their culture, much as they do the Spartans."

Like a soul searching former warrior contemplates our species without a blind hatred, looking to understand how we 'tick' I guess. To be sure, I assume the old Covenant did at least some research on us while doing what they did best.  Dammit, I'm trying to sleep and now my brain is in fanfic mode."
HaloStory,3bn3il,Metlman13,14,Tue Jun 30 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, they still hate humans quite a bit after the war. Only a few elites like the Arbiter have actually rethought their blind hatred, and even then they have reasons to hate groups like the ONI.  After the war, they probably did give some human music and literature a try, mostly ancient stuff like Beowulf and Hymn Choirs though as they likely see current human culture as extravagant and disgusting. Maybe there's even small groups of Elites who have gatherings sort of like fan clubs where they discuss this stuff. The Brutes are too caught up in pack wars to seriously care about alien cultures, Grunts probably don't care either way, the Prophets are mostly dead, the Lekgolo are mostly loyal to the Elites and every other race pretty much doesn't care, except for the Engineers.

A movie Sith is still insanely strong. A railgun is probably the worst choice to kill a Force user. It's just a fast moving object that is just as susceptible to the Force as a stationary one. While you are correct, an Energy Sword is functionally identical to a lightsaber, the Energy Sword design is in every way more primitive and inferior to a lightsaber. They expend too much energy at once, are even easier to deflect with a larger surface area, and are very difficult to master. No Spartan on record has mastered its use, yet the Sith are masters with their weapons."

When we finally got a look at one of their best and brightest, however, it was less a dream come true than it was a nightmarish revelation with fierceness and rage to rival Ripa 'Moramee.  5) Thel 'Vadam - Blinded by the artifacts of Gods, disgraced by an ancient conspiracy, and redeemed by will and honour alone, 'Vadam has more than earned his rightful place as ruler of the Sangheili.  4) The Gravemind - A timeless entity with the knowledge from billions of consumed intellects inside itself, the Gravemind, and by extension the Flood, has the potential to be the greatest force the galaxy has ever reckoned with.  3) Cortana - A third-generation smart A.I., Cortana has through the years proven a valuable source of information and a trusted friend to the Master Chief. She was the true personality behind Chief's icy exterior for so long, it's no wonder she's seen as the Human in their person-machine dynamic.  2) Miranda Keyes - Even in the 26th century it's difficult for a woman to be measured against anyone but their father, and yet Commander Keyes proved on Earth, Delta Halo, and the greater Ark that she will be remembered and commended for her valour as much (if not more) than Jacob Keyes will.  1) Rtas 'Vadum - Neither the Sangheili nor Humanity are too fond of physical deformities, but Rtas 'Vadum has pulled through time and time again. Though Thel 'Vadam may be the greatest warrior the Sangheili have to offer, 'Vadum is the greatest survivor of their time, seeing as his mandibles were severed in a fight with the Flood and his culture all but condemns those who bleed in a fight to death."
HaloStory,3boo0z,In_Medias_Res,2,Wed Jul 1 09:44:06 2015 UTC,I get the feeling this will be the most unique list in this thread.
HaloStory,3boo0z,Defguru,7,Wed Jul 1 12:36:25 2015 UTC,Linda is my favorite character because she says probably a few sentences in the entire series but her personality comes through by what she does and her demeanor as written by Nylund.
HaloStory,3boo0z,tblots4,9,Wed Jul 1 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like 10 is too many, past 5 they're all just kind of the same as all the other characters.    Mendicant Bias - his status as most powerful artificial intelligence (second to the Domain maybe?) is made even more interesting by his fall. His conversation with the Gravemind was so interesting to me, and the idea of it lasting 43 years is also crazy to me. I really want to see how he has returned from rampancy. We'll see later in the games, perhaps Halo 5? Who knows. Ur-Didact in the Forerunner Trilogy - I thought the Ur-Didact in Halo 4 was too much of a cookie-cutter villain. To me, not very interesting. In the books, admittedly before 'rampancy', he was kind of a likeable asshole ... blunt, forceful, but intelligent and he cared about doing the right thing. He was also kind of funny with how blunt he was. John - ... Cortana - added a lot of character to the missions, someone to kind of voice what all of us were thinking. Funny than it was an AI that would do that, and not the human. Halsey - Definitely the most interesting character, but probably the least likeable. Even if you forgave her for the Spartan program (which I do), she is just plain rude. But it's clear she understood the weight of responsibility she had and she made the best decisions she could have at the time. I enjoyed her arc from Fall of Reach to Onyx, where she would sacrifice the few for the many, but she eventually saw that when you do that, the people left lose a bit of their humanity. And that's when she tried to save as many lives as she could right then. It probably has more to do with her guilt than any rationalization though.   Honourable mention to Kurt, Offensive Bias, Guilty Spark/Chakas (especially with the Halo Anniversary Terminals), Truth and Bornstellar.  Wow I guess that adds up to 10 then..."

HaloStory,3boo0z,splader,3,Wed Jul 1 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"Master Chief Thel'Vadam Edward Buck.  I find his story fascinating and he's the best example of what an unaugmented human can do.  One of the best soldiers in the galaxy, and that's before he became a Spartan. Jacob Keyes.  The naval combat chapters in Fall of Reach and First Strike were Nylund's best writing, so it comes as no surprise that Jacob Keyes gets a lot of my praise as an interesting character with an interesting arc. Will.  The only other Spartan to make it on the list besides 117.  I like Will because he's fairly realistic among the outrageous OC Spartans he stands alongside.  Linda can shoot the wings off a fly, Kelly is the most OP Spartan ever created, Fred is basically the Chief but better.  Will doesn't drag a lot of attention to himself.  He was a jokester who lost his jokes, hates his formal name and is skilled enough in H2H that he can tackle a Hunter and tear it's abdomen out with his bare hands. Cortana.  Quirky, friendly, the narrator almost. Forsell.  From Contact Harvest, this recruit is quiet, in touch with nature and selfless towards his squad mates.  He hasn't got a privileged upbringing, but he's strong, fast, caring and incredibly brave. Vergil.  A friendly AI who uses puppy sound effects to try and guilt Sadie into doing stuff.  That's fantastic.  Later absorbed by a friendly Huragok which is two great tastes that taste great together. Dutch.  Dutch has low bravado, high amounts of respect for his allies and is a no-nonsense kind of guy.  The fact that he went home to become a family man adds a lovely touch of realism to the Halo universe.  Not everyone can be a soldier forever.  Everyone has a breaking point, and Dutch hit his.  Now he just wants to live out his life. Avery Johnson.  Narrowly.  I would've put him much higher, except for two things.  Firstly, his characterization between the games and Contact Harvest is wildly inconsistent.  I guess he's had a full war to come to appreciate levity and good humor, but it seems unlikely.  Secondly, Halo 3 tried it's best to assassinate his character and make him supremely worthless.  Everything Johnson does in Halo 3 is a hilarious failure for the player to clean up afterwards.  After so many mishaps, you can't really take the guy seriously anymore.   Honorable mentions to Maccabeus, Lighter than Some and Dadab from Contact Harvest."
HaloStory,3boo0z,ilessthan3math,3,Wed Jul 1 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"1) John 117 - To say otherwise would be a bit of a disservice to the reason this series came into existence.  He's a monster of a man and there are a wealth of great stories to go with him.  2) Lighter Than Some / Dadab duo - This duo is perhaps my favorite side-story in all of Halo.  Really got attached to the two of them in Harvest.  3) Black Box ('BB') - Seemed bland enough at first, but he really grew on me throughout the Kilo-Five trilogy, and the ending of Mortal Dictata really got me.  4) Kelly-087 - My favorite of the 'other' SIIs.  She's a beast, and like all the Spartan IIs pretty much 100X more badass than anyone else in the universe.  5) Kurt-051 - His whole story was awesome.  Ghosts of Onyx may be the best Halo novel out there.  6) Preston Cole - One ""short"" story is enough to know this guy was a badass.  It certainly helps that Nylund is an amazing writer.  7) Evan Phillips - Again, not particularly interesting at first, but his character develops a lot during the Kilo-Five trilogy.  Really interesting character who changes dynamically (and realistically so) throughout the novels.  8) Requires Adjustment ('Adj') - I fucking love Huragok.  If I didn't care for any diversity in my list, there would probably be another 2 of them on this list.  However, Adj will do.  He's funny and useful and nice, and comes off as likeable as soon as he is introduced.  I think I laughed out loud when he was complaining about frosting the cake for Osman.  9) Jacob Keyes - Great commander, shows up all over the place in Halo lore.  Great character in everything he appears in.  10) Admiral Danforth Whitcomb - I had Avery Johnson as #10 before seeing OPs list.  Whitcomb is way better.  I thought I was gonna hate him after the beginning of First Strike when you get the impression he's irresponsible and selfishly getting Spartan's killed for no reason.  Turns out he's awesome.  10a) Catherine Halsey - Complex character who is very contentious among fans of the series.  I kind of like the contrast between Kilo-Five Halsey and pre-Kilo-Five Halsey.  Gives her more depth, like as you are getting told the story from people (Traviss=Parangosky) with different viewpoints.  Disclaimer: I have not yet read the Forerunner Trilogy which is why I have no characters from that era."

HaloStory,3blml9,LovisTheWise,13,Tue Jun 30 11:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Wargames as we see it in the games is exactly how it is in-lore. Imo, the new gametype Breakout seems to fit the lore much better regarding what the War Games could possibly be because it's round-based in a visually simulated environment that seems to fit older training exercises much better. Realistically, War Games are probably round-based across the board with every gametype."
HaloStory,3blml9,Ardusk,2,Tue Jun 30 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"It would be accurate to say that the Breakout arena is the closest we've seen to what the War Game simulator looks like without the holographic enhancements.  However, I'm not sure if I agree with the notion that respawning in purely multiplayer-flavor. Given 343's recent trends, I'd say it's like there is an explanation for respawning. One idea that comes to mind is a Forerunner trans-location grid like we've seen on the Halo rings or Requiem (though on a much smaller scale). When a Spartan ""dies"", he or she is teleported to a new location to ""respawn""."
HaloStory,3blml9,Toa_Freak,3,Tue Jun 30 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that would require an understanding of Slipspace technology that the UNSC doesn't have. It seems unlikely that in a matter of a few years they would have been able to reach the Forerunner's technological level regarding slipspace enough to use it for respawning Spartans in a simulation, especially considering they were still having problems with forerunner tech in Halo 4."
HaloStory,3blml9,Ardusk,2,Tue Jun 30 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Very true. The only other idea that I could realistically conceive would be that Spartans simply walk to a designated point to ""respawn"" after ""death."" Unless you're right, and it's all canonically round-based (which I could certainly accept, but I just have a feeling that respawning might be a canon thing)."

HaloStory,3blml9,Zadeinator,2,Tue Jun 30 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"If the way we see War Games is 100% accurate to how it looks in-universe, hard light and teleportation technology. But that seems a bit too advanced for even the Infinity to have, and the description of a War Games match in one of the books (forget which; New Blood probably) didn't saying anything about either of those things. So I'm guessing the ""it's all a simulation"" thing is a loose justification for having the characters make references to multiplayer-related things, and it probably doesn't go any deeper than that."

HaloStory,3blml9,GandalfBlue12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"I think the initial drop should be a pelican, respawns should be either orbital drops, or... If maybe the team respawns as a group. IE once three people are dead, respawns will happen after x amount of time for that team. Then it can be a pelican again.   Drop pods would be cool, because then maybe you could choose where you landed."
HaloStory,3blml9,shaneathan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think the actual Spartans should have a say on where they land, considering it would be his/her commander planning out ""safe"" areas to drop into. I do think that landing in a Pelican is partially the same as titanfall, because you drop from a spacecraft just meters above the ground. If it doesn't violate anything, I wanna see a fully loaded Pelican.  I can never understand why there are like 5 empty seats at any given time..."
HaloStory,3blml9,GandalfBlue12,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"Well that's my point. If you do the group respawn thing, you could see a partially to fully loaded pelican.   As for the drop pods- Do it sort of like battlefield. You have certain points that you can respawn at, even friendlies, and you'll come in around there- in a drop pod. This would give an explanation for basically choosing where to fall, and I think it'd be pretty badass to kick open the pod firing away like a madman."

HaloStory,3bjky6,parkerhalo,20,Mon Jun 29 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"Spartan Abilities are built into their armor while armor abilities were an extra attachment to it. If a Spartan needed to, they could still use armor abilities with their upgraded GEN2."
HaloStory,3bjky6,Ardusk,4,Mon Jun 29 19:30:34 2015 UTC,See this is what I am curious about as well. I think the reactor that powers GEN2 wouldn't be able to handle that. Then again I could be wrong. Just think... Ground Pounding and activating armor lock as soon as you land. That would be amazing haha.
HaloStory,3bjky6,Maggruber,10,Mon Jun 29 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"They are considered wasteful, as improving the base functions of the armor is statistically more effective than investing in a limited number of attachments that are more likely to fail or inhibiting of the armor's other abilities. AAs like Active Camo can be seen as redundant as Spartans are already experts in covert operations, but even more so are rarely deployed for stealth operations, and the jetpack does little to improve tactical capabilities."
HaloStory,3bjky6,Ardusk,5,Tue Jun 30 03:08:05 2015 UTC,"Also, if the abilities are built in it would be less likely for them to get damaged in-combat saving the Spartans from accidents similar to what happened to James-005 aboard Gamma Station."
HaloStory,3bjky6,Maggruber,7,Tue Jun 30 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, by making the thruster pack standard issue they can improve on reliability and functionality that would prevent critical failures like James' thruster pack. Remember what happened to Georgia?"
HaloStory,3bjky6,YeoBean,2,Tue Jun 30 03:42:33 2015 UTC,We don't talk about that
HaloStory,3bjky6,crasy8s,7,Wed Jul 1 14:18:56 2015 UTC,In terms of a canon point of view I think they are willing to trade off temporary effects such as active camo and holograms for mobility. Giving the Spartans complete control of their lateral motion gives them better odds of surviving.
HaloStory,3bjky6,GandalfBlue12,3,Mon Jun 29 19:26:11 2015 UTC,Does this mean no armor abilities like active camo in halo 5?
HaloStory,3bjky6,Raptorclaw621,2,Tue Jun 30 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are no armour abilities in Halo 5. However, powerups such as Active Camo, Overshield, Speed Boost and maybe even Damage Boost will be on-map pick-ups, like in Halo CE-3."
HaloStory,3bjky6,YeoBean,3,Tue Jun 30 17:49:39 2015 UTC,bingo.
HaloStory,3bjky6,Skrimyt,9,Wed Jul 1 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"They can still use armor abilities in canon, but they're relegated to external mission-specific attachments that are no longer considered part of normal training regimen (and are hence absent from War Games).  The M805X thruster pack attachment has been practically obsoleted by the advancement of MJOLNIR GEN2's integrated thruster system, originally just zero-G maneuvering jets that through continuous development have grown into a robust and powerful all-conditions maneuvering system capable of implementing the Spartan Abilities we see now.  The Series 12 SOLA jetpack is still potentially useful as it is powerful enough to continuously lift a Spartan in MJOLNIR, while the integrated thrusters can at best suspend one. It is however more of a niche tool now and only really needed for mission scenarios where fireteams would have to do a lot of vertical ascending maneuvers for whatever reason. I don't know if it would interfere with integrated thruster operations, but given its install location, I assume that it would hinder sprint thruster assist, Spartan Charge and Ground Pound functions.  And many of the other Halo 4 AAs were Forerunner-sourced. This includes the Promethean Vision system, the Autosentry, the Hardlight Shield, possibly the Regenerator. With the loss of Requiem, I don't think there are any more large caches of Promethean equipment to harvest, and the UNSC would rather have Spartans on the battlefield relying on indigenous technology, than barely-understood alien artifacts that are in limited supply.  And finally, the Type-3 Active Camo module is also not indigenous, and is Sangheili-sourced. It would also interfere with all integrated thruster functions, and thus would be used used only when Active Camo stealth capabilities are critical to the mission and worth the trade-offs.  TL;DR, it's better to train with standard-issue, reliable equipment than with niche external attachments and unknown alien gadgetry."
HaloStory,3bjky6,CommanderMilez,2,Mon Jun 29 22:12:06 2015 UTC,OP your answer is right here!
HaloStory,3bjky6,TheEld,-3,Wed Jul 1 01:36:32 2015 UTC,Armor abilities were literally just in Spartan Strike and are in Halo Online.
HaloStory,3bjky6,TheNerdyOne_,-2,Mon Jun 29 19:27:27 2015 UTC,They will not be returning in Halo 5 at all. I can almost promise you they will not be in future Halo FPS games as well. Spartan Strike is a top down shooter and armor abilities make more sense gameplay wise. Canon wise the Spartan IV's no longer use armor abilities.
HaloStory,3bifao,HeyLudaYouLikeToEat,13,Mon Jun 29 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"The drones have always been sort of the oddball of the Covenant, not really having many relatable characteristics, though I believe they can communicate with non-Yanme’e in some form. Also interesting to me is that they can pick up marines and fly with them despite weighing only 77 kg.   From a gameplay perspective they’ve been a burden to fight so I don’t see them coming back. From a lore perspective I don’t see them being reintroduced either. Without the prophets leading them being in control of their queens, they’ve probably stayed away from war entirely. Though it’s always possible there are still nests remaining underground on Earth or anywhere else the Covenant has been that have not been found yet. That would be an interesting plot device in a future novel."

However, Hopalong was able to translate their entire language into English.  I disagree with the notion that they will not be featured in later titles, seeing as there was at least one queen present in Merg Vol's Covenant and Jul 'Mdama's Covenant.  I do however doubt that we'll be seeing too many hives on Earth, as interesting an idea as that may be, as the Yanme'e typically create hives in areas they've conquered and the massive heat produced by the hives would be difficult to conceal from the UEG."

What does a queen look like?  What of their homeworld?  What was first contact like, and how does communication with them work?    Say what you will of Traviss' writing, but I loved how Mortal Dictata took us to the Jackal homeworld and explored their culture and interactioms with other species.

HaloStory,3bifao,lalosfire,5,Mon Jun 29 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"Meh, the Yanme'e in Evolutions were psychopaths, not average members of their species. And the ones in Contact Harvest were probably members of the worker caste. When the Jiralhanae forced them into either menial roles or combat positions (that would traditionally be fulfilled by the Yanme'e in the protector caste), the Yanme'e were pissed and kind of confused by their new roles. Of course, this doesn't justify them killing a Huragok and later more or less helping the humans finish of the Unggoy aboard Tiara Station, but the Jiralhanae were kind of at fault too."
HaloStory,3bifao,DrummerBoy2999,3,Tue Jun 30 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"That's a reasonable argument. But I liked Lighter Than Some, and Huragok in general, too much to be OK with the Yanme'e."

HaloStory,3bifao,TheEld,5,Tue Jun 30 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed how they broadened the range of other intellegent species, and were also shown to have some more autonomy. They were only deployed into the battlefield later on, because of their technological insights (still overshadowed by Huragok though). I am interested to see them develop in more of a lore perspective as an independent faction.   I also find it interesting that we only really see them around earth for the most part H2, H3, H3:ODST.

HaloStory,3bgzzl,DirtyPeckerVision,5,Mon Jun 29 03:36:26 2015 UTC,The organon is the domain. Not sure if I should have spoiler raged that. But at the end of the forerunner series the librarian gets told by the Lord of a Admirals that they are one in the same
HaloStory,3bgzzl,Thelast_sparton,2,Mon Jun 29 03:51:14 2015 UTC,I had thought that the domain was something different than the organon though?
HaloStory,3bgzzl,Master_Chief_71,9,Mon Jun 29 05:24:09 2015 UTC,"The Organon was supposed to be the key to Forerunners accessing and using all of the Precursor tech that was sitting dormant across the galaxy.  Since Forerunners were unable to use technology controlled by neural physics, this was highly sought after (though it was thought to be a legend or non-existent).  It was revealed at the end of Silentium (the third and final novel in the Forerunner Saga) that the Organon was in fact the Domain."
HaloStory,3bgzzl,Fenris447,3,Mon Jun 29 05:33:56 2015 UTC,"And that by activating the Halo Array, they'd be destroying the Domain and therefore the Organon."

HaloStory,3bgzzl,DRAGONSCALEBEER,0,Mon Jun 29 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what is it. Is it a giant rogue psychic computer planet, a little black box in a basement emanating neural computations, etc."
HaloStory,3bgzzl,Rhydnara,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:40:58 2015 UTC,It's a Precursor artifact/technology that stores information.  It's a lot like the internet.
HaloStory,3bgzzl,Jl1223,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"The Precursors stored the Domain within every single precursor artifact within the known galaxy. So their star roads, their ships, their buildings, everything they ever created stored a fraction of what was essentially their galaxy-wide Internet database.  That's also why the Domain was destroyed. The Halo's pulse specifically targeted destroying things based around Precursor neural physics, which was the basis and building block for everything the precursors ever made."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,GoldPilot,36,Sun Jun 28 19:02:52 2015 UTC,I think the problem now is that since they have been roled into the S-IV program we don't hear of the S-III program anymore. And when the S-III program was around it was so top secret and hush hush that no one really knew. So I think it just comes down to terrible timing and bad luck.   But I agree with you that they are seriously badass. I wish we saw more of them in the lore. They are such great characters to expand on that I hope 343i don't forget about them.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,BaggerOfLettuce,3,Sun Jun 28 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the basic premise of the S-III program lends itself to much more interesting characters than the S-IV program does. So far, not a single one of our S-IV characters has a past that I am at all interested in, except for maybe buck. But I feel like you could grab any S-III, and they'd probably have a pretty interesting story — albeit fairly similar to their comrades.   And that's just their back stories. Now that the war's over, they represent much more exciting and dynamic story telling possibilities. Man for man, Gamma Company were supposedly the best Spartans ever created, according to Kurt and Mendez, who would know a thing or two about that, but all of them were offered retirement.   Your average Gamma Company Spartan has had no childhood, knows only military service and violence, has had next to no interactions with people who didn't suffer the same fate, and on top of it all, relies on regular drug usage to avoid becoming criminally insane — how does someone like that adapt to civilian life?   Even those who stayed in, how will they interact with the S-IVs, who despite being Spartans just the same in the eyes of military planners, have some sense of identity outside their status as Spartans?   They are much better trained and have received far more comprehensive augmentations than their comrades/successors. Are they kept in separate units? Do they have special assignments? What does all that entail?"
HaloStory,3bfdzx,TomShoe,25,Tue Jun 30 23:26:12 2015 UTC,"People get hung up a lot on the ""cheaper"" part. The majority of people also seem to latch onto the fact that both Alpha and Beta were wiped out. They assume (and I don't fault them for this) that Alpha and Beta were annihilated on their first operation. Ghosts of Onyx only has one sentence that shows Alpha participated in more operations than PROMETHEUS and the evidence that Beta participated in more than one operation is supplementary.   Gamma's extra augments also seem to throw people for a loop, as I've seen several people argue that all Spartan-IIIs have these augments or that these augments were required to curtail some innate inability in the Spartan-III."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,BraveExpress2,20,Sun Jun 28 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"were wiped out.   If the II's were sent on those missions with identical equipment to the III's, they would also have been wiped out."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,asianedy,17,Sun Jun 28 19:48:05 2015 UTC,To add to this: If they'd been given equivalent equipment and equivalent numbers they'd have been wiped out.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,BraveExpress2,11,Sun Jun 28 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"Would they though?  I mean, bluue team by itself took out a few hundred ships on the UH."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,bobeo,15,Sun Jun 28 20:32:28 2015 UTC,Yes they would. Alpha's extraction were destroyed and they were pinned down by an entire Covenant fleet hellbent on wiping the Spartans off of their fortress world.  And no matter how badass Blue Team is they wouldn't survive the nuclear explosion that wiped out Beta company.  The Spartan-IIs hadn't even gone through their first combat operation by the ages that Alpha and Beta were already on their last suicide missions.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,atfsix,5,Mon Jun 29 00:54:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why the IIIs were developed though- so they could be used in suicide missions, because the loss of a II was too high a cost."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,JMAC426,10,Mon Jun 29 01:47:33 2015 UTC,It was mainly because all the firepower of the Spartan-IIs combined wasn't enough to take down the facilities at Pegaussi Delta and K-79. The UNSC needed a unit as effective as the Spartan-IIs with 10x the manpower and firepower.  Even if they spent the lives of every last Spartan-II at K-79 there weren't nearly enough of them to cover all 13 objectives.  The Spartan-IIs would only have had 30 rifles at most if they had taken on Operation: Torpedo and they'd be going up against thousands of Covenant.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,atfsix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:04:44 2015 UTC,Well the Spartan-IIIs weren't as effective units as the Spartan-IIs. That was the tradeoff. Less individual value but in large numbers definitely much more effective.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,benhan23,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"I heard the same thing as atfsix that spartan IIIs are on par with Spartan IIs. Maybe just because of their frontal lobe augmentation or that they had better training, would be fun to see two of them fight it out though."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,Son_of_Echo,2,Mon Jun 29 12:38:20 2015 UTC,At one point in Ghosts of Onix one of the SPARTAN-III's of Saber team managed to take on Kelly in hand-to-hand combat and Kelly only won after pinning him to a tree.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,butwhysir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"They were envisioned as cheaper alternatives, and that meant cutting some corners in certain aspects of their creation, where the costs were simply too high.   The biggest of these was the SPI armor; instead of costing the same as a ""battlegroup,"" its cost was more in line with what you'd expect for a personal protection.   It also meant less time in training, although this was less extreme as time went on; Alpha Company was only trained for five years, Beta for Six, and Gamma for seven year, the same as the S-IIs, training for a full year after receiving their augmentations. It's also noted that Kurt based the training on lessons learned from his own time training as an S-II, and it's likely that each company so incremental improvements to the quality of their training, as well as to it's duration.   There augmentations certainly had a much higher success rate, and although there's some debate as to whether their augmentations were on par with their counterparts, it seems to me from Ghosts of Onyx that they were generally comparable, with the major cost cutting measures coming from the dramatically higher success rate.   The main advantage of the S-IIs was sheer experience, as the S-IIIs generally didn't live long enough to accrue the same level of experience as the S-IIs, but this was largely a function of the missions they were sent on, and there were of course exceptions among those who were able to avoid the suicide missions."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,TomShoe,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"That cost was mostly a result of their armor, and their small numbers hiking the per-unit cost way up."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,TomShoe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"That's true from a monetary perspective, but I was more referring to the cost to the war effort of losing their primary super soldiers."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,JMAC426,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"Right, but that cost can be relatively easily monetized, and likely would have been. The S-IIIs were cheaper in terms of cost to the war effort because there were way more of them, meaning losing one wasn't the end of the world."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,TomShoe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:42:31 2015 UTC,Spartan II wouldn't have engaged and suicide rushed the objective. They would have used small team tactics to advance and take it out. Evac would be a lot simpler with 4 Spartan II rather than the 300 Spartan IIi
HaloStory,3bfdzx,Airbornequalified,0,Mon Jun 29 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"I assume you're referring to Beta Company during Operation Torpedo? They rushed the objective to avoid bombing from Seraph fighters, and didn't really meet with significant casualties from the charge. The reasoning being that the Covenant wouldn't bomb their own factory. Shit didn't really turn tits up for Beta Company until several covenant warships appeared above them and dropped off thousands of reinforcements, at which point the majority of Beta Company turned to fight them, knowing they'd probably die, but hoping to buy time for the rest to destroy the objective which they did."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,TomShoe,9,Wed Jul 1 00:12:58 2015 UTC,With advanced armor and weaponry. Not quite the same odds.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,SkyBlind,-2,Sun Jun 28 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. If there were 300 Spartan-IIs trained to the age of 14, I don't think they would have been wiped out the same way even with the same circumstances and armour. They really were special individuals, where their resourcefulness and natural intellect is unmatched. Obviously nothing could have been done once orbital bombardment started, but I don't think they would have let themselves be cut off from their extraction points. Spartan-IIIs did the best they could and did it admirably, but the Spartan-IIs would have found a better way."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,benhan23,7,Sun Jun 28 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"but the Spartan-IIs would have found a better way.   Those are baseless assumptions. The III's were trained by a II, they think exactly like a II. Please explain how the II's would avoid the slaughter during TORPEDO. How would they reach the facility without running across that open field? How would they make sure the facility was destroyed without the enemies interfering? How would they do anything different than the III's?"
HaloStory,3bfdzx,asianedy,7,Sun Jun 28 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"They don't think like the -IIs. In Ghosts of Onyx, Ackerson tells Kurt that there wasn't a tight psychological screening, so the Spartan-IIIs would be nothing like the Spartan-IIs. Some things can't be taught.   Edit: found the quote from Ghosts of Onyx:   Kurt discovered they didn't match the perfect psychological and genetic markers set in Dr. Halsey's original selection protocols. Colonel Ackerson had warned him they had drawn from a less “statistically robust” group. These recruits wouldn't be anything like himself, John, Kelly, or any of the original Spartan II candidates.   .   How would they reach the facility without running across that open field?    OK you're talking about Operation TORPEDO. I'll admit there was nothing they could have done differently there because they were in open season right from the get-go. I even mentioned ""nothing could have been done once orbital bombardment started"" so that should have tipped you . I was talking specifically about Alpha Company, as I referenced being cut off from extraction. That was a multi-day operation that could have been done differently."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,benhan23,0,Sun Jun 28 23:50:29 2015 UTC,Being trained by a II does not automatically mean they think like a II. The IIs themselves were taught by non-Spartans. Just because Kurt is a great soldier doesn't mean he can mold those he teaches to be just like him.
HaloStory,3bfdzx,JMAC426,3,Mon Jun 29 01:53:31 2015 UTC,When Kurt and Mendez say they've been trained just as good or even better...
HaloStory,3bfdzx,asianedy,-1,Mon Jun 29 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"That was a comment on the brutality/pace of the training, not how well the soldiers turned out due to the training. The Spartan-IIs were superior specimens with longer training periods, superior physical prowess and specific psychological screening. No matter what you can't overcome nature when the screening allowed for that much variance.   Kurt discovered they didn't match the perfect psychological and genetic markers set in Dr. Halsey's original selection protocols. Colonel Ackerson had warned him they had drawn from a less “statistically robust” group. These recruits wouldn't be anything like himself, John, Kelly, or any of the original Spartan II candidates."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,benhan23,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"wouldn't be anything like himself   When recruited. The results speak for themselves, and Kurt himself said that the III's were pretty damn close. And regarding Alpha companies destruction, how would the II's somehow clear the extraction when the are was destroyed, while they were being swarmed by thousands of soldiers and low on supplies?"
HaloStory,3bfdzx,asianedy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Requesting source on Kurt saying they're pretty damn close in everything. Psychologically, academically, physically, everything. Show me.  It never says the area was destroyed, merely that they were cut off from the Calypso extraction vehicles. The entire operation lasted 7 days. With genetically bigger, stronger, faster, smarter people, the Spartan-IIs would have found a way not to be cornered and isolated from their extraction plan. Think about what guys like Carter, Noble-6 could have done differently in terms of planning, organizing, and executing a better long-term plan. Now imagine 300 of those guys, the best of the best of the Spartan-IIIs. Spartan-IIs would have been similar/possibly better. 7 days leaves a lot of variables that could have been improved upon."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,benhan23,7,Mon Jun 29 03:02:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Chief was an average one. He and Six were the only Spartans to be rated as ""hyperlethal vectors""."

HaloStory,3bfdzx,TheWarlockk,12,Sun Jun 28 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"III training was tougher, but wasn't II training a lot longer and more exhaustive?

For the record, I wasn't selling the Spartan-IIIs short; they've proven they are very effective in what they were trained/created to do. However, comparing a singular Spartan-II to a Spartan-III is very one-sided, and must be argued as such.

I know they're great super-soldiers and they've proven that time and time again, but when comparing them to Spartan-IIs everything is said in context. Comparatively, they lack many things. Can they still destroy Covenant units? Of course. Can they wipe the floor with a Spartan-IV? I definitely think so.

If that isn't degrading them, I don't know what it is. You clearly state that they are worse just because they don't show respect.

So an armored S-IV would outmatch an S-III who was not in full MJOLNIR (The S-IIIs were issued SPI armor which was far from GEN1 standards).  If you look at the stats, an S-III out of anything BUT GEN2 would likely lose to an armored S-IV. HOWEVER because unarmored S-IIIs are superior to unarmored S-IVs, the improvements the GEN2 armor provides would be increased for an S-III. So if both were in GEN2, then the S-III would win over an S-IV (and would likely beat an S-II in GEN1 as well).  All of that said, regardless of how they stack up against the IIs and IVs, the S-IIIs are by no means pushovers. They would wipe the floor against unaugmented troops without breaking a sweat. It's hard to keep that in perspective when all of the comparisons are between them and the other SPARTAN classes."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,Sangheilioz,3,Mon Jun 29 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"One thing to bear in mind is that S-III's were described as slaughtering Sangheili in melee/close combat.  This was in SPI armor.  I'd say that they'd give a S-IV a close fight, even if they aren't guaranteed to win the fight."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,altytwo_jennifer,0,Mon Jun 29 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not saying they wouldn't put up a fight, just that the S-IVs have the advantage, by the numbers. :)"

Mostly because I spend most of my energy on not liking the IVs.  I'll put it this way, I consider IIs and IIIs Spartans. IVs are just pretenders."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,MrMochaJones,5,Sun Jun 28 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"pretenders.   Sigh. So just because they aren't machines and are actually human, they can't be Spartans? It seems like most people miss the point of the IV's."

To me, the training from childhood is what psychologically makes a Spartan a Spartan. Physical augments, armour, etc can be replicated later in life. The psyche can't be. John and his colleagues were Spartans before they were soldiers, or anything else. IVs come in with all their adult baggage, and bad habits."
HaloStory,3bfdzx,JMAC426,9,Mon Jun 29 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I've always seen it when this argument comes up. Yes the Spartan IVs come from the best of the best for current soldiers, but they grew up generally with a normal childhood. Spartan IIs and IIIs have basically known nothing but a soldiers life. Just like ancient Spartans, they were bred for war, morally correct or not. I don't really have any hate towards the IVs but I feel like they're different in the way that project Spartan was from Orion."

It also has external ports that allow them to inject biofoam when needed.   During the ground battle on Reach, Fred suffered a torn Achilles' tendon but due to the armor's capabilities, he was able to actually run to safety and later medical treatment.  Also, keep in mind that you're referring to multiplayer. They have to have a defined point where a player can die."
HaloStory,3bdibe,scotiej,10,Sun Jun 28 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"The aromour could definitely compensate well for musculoskeletal injuries such as that. Visceral organ injuries, however, would be another thing entirely, depending on the amount of bleeding. A shattered kidney or severe liver laceration will put you down pretty quick- however, if biofoam can get applied internally somehow (directed hose into a wound, or syringe through the skin?) and is effective enough to stop bleeding from large arteries, then in the short term they could keep fighting without the functions of those organs."

Naturally, being sci-fi, there's no definite explanation how the armor does this, but it does. Still freaking cool how badass the II's are."
HaloStory,3bdibe,scotiej,8,Sun Jun 28 13:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've always felt the Spartans (and the Halo stories in general) work best on the level of being almost mythological, without every detail needing to be explained. I would love to be a medical consultant for works of fiction thougg- it's one of my pet peeves.  Interestingly, I looked into her specific injuries on the wiki: ""Kelly's injuries turned out to be life threatening; she had a fever and low blood pressure due to moderate bleeding in her liver, and one of her lungs had completely collapsed. Dr. Halsey noted that it was amazing Kelly was still alive, let alone still fighting, despite these two potentially fatal conditions."" That's actually a pretty well conceived injury list- I've already discussed the liver hemorrhage, and a pneumothorax could likewise be compensated for temporarily with a biofoam plug along with a needle to decompress the air that has leaked into the chest cavity. Without treatment, those things would kill her eventually, but she could fight for a while with first aid from the armour."

Regular humans loaded up on adrenaline can run around like normal with debilitating injuries, I've seen battle casualties not even know their arm or leg was blown off until they try to use said limb, then look at it after wondering why it wasn't working as normal.

HaloStory,3bdibe,Master_Chief_71,11,Sun Jun 28 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"I know the Mark VI suit that Master Chief is given in Halo 2 has an onboard medical system that automatically detects injuries and injects biofoam (Halo's temporary but still a miracle battlefield injury cure-all) and other on-board pharmaceuticals into them to help with pain management and recovery.  This is why there isn't a health bar in Halos 2-4  As far as Combat Evolved and Reach are concerned (where there was a health bar), I would say it's due to the fact that Spartans are trained to ignore pain.  There is a part in the book First Strike where Halsey is evaluating the Spartan-II's health after they had rescued/reunited with her, and Kelly (soon to be Blue Team squad member in Halo 5: Guardians) had a collapsed lung, failing liver/kidneys, and all sorts of torn/damaged muscles, and was still able to fight effectively without uttering a single complaint about her injuries.  That is part of how badass Spartan-II's are.  They could fight while their body was failing, and still do it while being more effective than most UNSC platoons.

HaloStory,3bdibe,tblots4,8,Sun Jun 28 05:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah no one wants ""bloody screen so real"" in Halo.   Health bar has never made much sense in video games, but yeah as someone already said, the 'recharging health' could just be approximated by biofoam getting you back to fighting condition after a few seconds.   Or possibly just as likely suit integrity, which 'breaks' after a certain number of hits and the last hit kills or incapacitates you since the suit is what does a lot of the movement for you. I remember the Chief just thought about moving his arm up and the suit moved his arm for him. This also explains how Spartans can keep fighting with like a fifth of their organs down ... they have insane resilience, but it's the suit that keeps them going as if they were 100% healthy."

HaloStory,3bdibe,JMAC426,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. Shock is a state of blood loss leading to organs being inadequately perfused. The only real treatment options are 1) replace the volume lost, which could be temporarily possible if the armour had storage for units of blood or another replacement solution such as normal saline, and/or 2) use vasopressor agents like norepinephrine or vasopressin, which keep blood pressure up by narrowing arteries- the downside being that without concurrent fluid replacement, this actually makes things worse because it will also decrease bloodflow to organs. Obviously UNSC technology is much more advanced than today's, but the circulatory system is pretty mechanical in nature- it's hard to imagine a way around it."
HaloStory,3bdibe,Dekar2401,4,Sun Jun 28 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"I want to add that in Halsey's Journal, she mentions that a Spartan's blood vessels can recover from injury faster than a normal Human's, that their vessels will close up in seconds if they sustain injury. I'm sure this can extend to other facets of recovery for them."
HaloStory,3bdibe,haloflour,2,Sun Jun 28 19:16:09 2015 UTC,As others have said the mjolnir would keep them going but the real reason is game-play necessity.  sidenote: The spartans in 4 had a little death stumble before they died. (this only one of many death animations) You could see them lose consciousness and start to stumble and die. It is subtly gruesome because its like watching someone get knocked out by a punch to the head.   When you watch that you know that type of blow could cause brain damage.
HaloStory,3bczi8,parkerhalo,28,Sun Jun 28 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  No Spartan-IV is going to have quite as good of training as the II's had.  They aren't raised to be soldiers.  Spartan-IV's are regular soldiers who became exceptional through their own merits.  In a way, this makes them special, but they will never have an intensive training like the Spartan-II's were given.  That being said, it is likely easier to train IV's to adapt to a variety of situations thanks to the War Games Holo Deck.  So to answer your question, I think that the II's were trained to be better, but the IV's have the advantage of adaptable training simulations, that can predict and adapt to any number of situations."
HaloStory,3bczi8,Master_Chief_71,20,Sun Jun 28 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, IIs have massive amounts of real life combat experience (on top of being groomed for war almost their entire lives), which I would argue is more valuable than any simulation, even if AI generated/controlled. Simulation by definition is still just simulating the real thing."
HaloStory,3bczi8,JMAC426,9,Sun Jun 28 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"I would assume that the simulations are based on data pulled from every documented encounter, the behavior of the AI should be pretty accurate.  It can't account for every variable, of course, but it can get close enough.  Being able to train against simulations of the threats the IVs will face in the field is extremely helpful.  Who's going to have an easier time against a Hunter, a II that has had limited experience battling them, or a IV that has run simulations against them many times?  Hunters are a great example.  It's very much suggested that Will was the first Human to ever kill a Hunter in hand-to-hand combat, while he was on Onyx.  And yet, we see Palmer doing the same thing in simulations during the newest Escalation issue."
HaloStory,3bczi8,TheNerdyOne_,8,Sun Jun 28 05:06:39 2015 UTC,Didn't Chief take one out with a grenade and his hands in FuD?

HaloStory,3bczi8,TheNerdyOne_,5,Sun Jun 28 07:52:23 2015 UTC,"Palmer did it in simulation, when the risk of death wasn't existent. If Spartan-IIs didn't kill Hunters with their bare hands on the regular, it's because they knew strategically that there was probably a better option. Also, Palmer's armour is far superior to what the Spartan-IIs were running with during the majority of the war. The fact that the Mk IV had no shields probably made a huge impact regarding the approach when dealing with plasma-wielding Covies. Palmer has displayed her lack of ability for choosing the best option available in the past, for example in one of the earlier Halo: Escalation issues she took off her helmet in the middle of a combat zone, put grenades in it and threw the entire helmet at the group of Covenant Remnants. There were way better options available than throwing your helmet away."
HaloStory,3bczi8,benhan23,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:22:02 2015 UTC,"Did you read The Fall of Reach?  Blue Team's encounter with Hunters went rather poorly for them.  Why?  Because they lacked experience, even though they had encountered them in the past.  James lost his arm, and their victory over the Hunters relied on clever use of their surroundings rather than actually fighting them.  That was in 2552.  If hand-to-hand combat with Hunters was so easy, James wouldn't have lost his arm.  Blue Team couldn't even take out the Hunters with their firearms, the novels says as much.  Palmer and Will weren't successful because they had energy shields or anything like that, they were successful because they didn't get hit (well, at least for Palmer, Will wasn't so lucky I'm afraid).  I couldn't care less about what Palmer's done in the past, it doesn't matter.  What matters is that she was successful, where IIs couldn't even take out a pair of Hunters in the conventional way just a few years earlier."
HaloStory,3bczi8,TheNerdyOne_,5,Sun Jun 28 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"Because you mentioned it I decided to re-read that entire section of the book. There were a number of things that were missing in 2552, including shield tech and experience with Hunters. In Fall of Reach, the entire encounter with the Hunters on Côte d'Azur was described as their first time encountering them. Forward Unto Dawn created an inconsistency, but just because John defeated one in FuD doesn't mean the rest of the Spartans had any experience doing so. James' injury wasn't unexpected given that it was the first meeting with such a deadly enemy. They did the best that they could given the circumstances, and I don't see how you can use that point against them.  So, what's your point? The Spartan-IIs were the first to successfully encounter Hunters in the field, and this information was then made available to everyone else since 2552. Since then they also faced a much larger number of Hunters, as indicated by John's adventures in the Halo series. Shield tech and much better armour makes a lot of difference when battling them, as shown by how John used a Jackal shield to completely block the plasma cannon on Côte d'Azur as well as his encounters in the games. If they're lucky enough to not get hit, there are better options that would have been learned since this first encounter. They would have learned that hitting the orange spots are a weakness, and that the armour can't be penetrated without Jackhammers. If they're smart they won't go hand-to-hand with a Hunter in a real encounter unless there really is no other options (like Will's case) or if they get the drop on it (as in, they sneak up from behind/above).  She didn't take out a Hunter with her bare hands, she did it in simulation when her life wasn't on the line and with much better tech to save her ass in case she messed up. You're talking like Spartan-IIs couldn't do better than her now, when it's obvious they can. 2552 was a long time ago from 2558, the survivors know how to battle Hunters now, and they have MUCH better tech since then. Don't talk as if she's better than the Spartan-IIs just because she's alive to witness what they've learned first-hand and learn from their mistakes. I've already given evidence that she doesn't know how to use the best strategic options; she cares more about flair and her personal vendettas than she does about doing things properly."
HaloStory,3bczi8,benhan23,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"Why is it that every time someone points out an advantage the IVs have over the IIs, it's automatically assumed that they're saying that the IIs suck?  You've completely misinterpreted my point, not once did I ever say that Palmer was better than the IIs.  My point was that experience is a very important factor, and one in which the IVs have the upper hand due to their access to simulations to train with.  Palmer was merely an example.  Sorry for not participating in the anti-Spartan IV circlejerk, but facts are facts.  And the fact of the matter is that the IVs generally have much more experience with certain enemy types, since they can run simulation after simulation and learn how to fight them."

I didn't assume you were saying the Spartan-IIs suck just because you pointed out a resource the Spartan-IVs have that the Spartan-IIs at the time didn't. You just phrased it in a way that made it sound like you were talking as if they were inferior. ""just a few years earlier"". Very clear what you were trying to insinuate. Those years are a lot of time for a lot of information and tech to be gathered.  They have access to the simulation/previous experiences that Spartan-IIs had because they are in a time where that stuff exists. The surviving Spartan-IIs also have access to this, plus they had first-hand experience, and they're much better at figuring out the best tactical options in combat, something I've pointed out that Palmer lacks."

HaloStory,3bczi8,Ave3ng3d7X,4,Sun Jun 28 21:43:53 2015 UTC,I feel like this needs to be said more. This is a generation that grew up with the war and most of them have probably spent the better part of a decade fighting it. They did not have the benefit of power armor or the best training available and they still survived
HaloStory,3bczi8,portbanker,13,Sun Jun 28 23:04:41 2015 UTC,I agree. Spartan IVs are humans before they are soldiers. This means when things go bad or shocking they may freeze for a second before reacting.  Spartan IIs are weapons before they are humans. They are at peak readiness at almost anytime in any situation. This preparedness is impossible to reproduce via standard training.  Even if a IV had the same mods as a II they would not react as fast as the II. The IIs don't gloat or lose focus.

HaloStory,3bczi8,captainconway,0,Mon Jun 29 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"No. War Games isn't really like the training given to the SIIs, it's more like constant combat experience. Because of it, a SIV can reach the 30 years of combat experience a SII has in a much faster pace, the underlying training on top of their longer time of service  would make the SIIs better than SIVs almost guaranteed."

BB is probably the only tolerable thing about the trilogy and I don't mind that he doesn't care for Cortana. I'm just sick of the overarching trend of character hate.
HaloStory,3bc22o,OneFinalEffort,2,Tue Jun 30 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to consider that the books were written from the perspective of people who were chisel based on ONI's psychological profiling to easily hate someone like Halsey and the fucked up things she did, and then they were fed that information."
HaloStory,3bc22o,Dekar2401,3,Tue Jun 30 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with those books is Osman. ONI wanted Halsey to kidnap children. She just told them what would have to be done to get it right. They're the ones who orchestrated it. Halsey treated the children like her own while ONI only wanted cannon fodder. Osman was one of those kids and she despises Halsey for no good reason. Not to mention Osman is Parangosky's lapdog and only too happy to get her hands dirty with bullshit espionage and betrayal of Humanity's allies.  Now the bitch is one of the heads of ONI? Fuck off. John has the right idea. ONI is too concerned with having control over everyone and everything and the differing races of the once mighty Covenant are in disarray. No one else is going to save the galaxy. It's up John and Blue Team.  On that note, this sets up our ""political views"" for Halo 5 quite nicely. I may not like the characters of Kilo-Five and find the pacing slow but at least I'm ready to do whatever needs to be done by Halo 5."
HaloStory,3bc22o,OneFinalEffort,2,Tue Jun 30 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, judging by how Halsey acts on a general basis, I feel like the only one she probably treated like her child was John. She was probably pretty distant to the rest and Osman probably was a defiant one who got to see Halsey's cold side more often than not.  This is just me supposing based on limited information. We always have to remember that the Spartan training was from the perspective of John, the kid who was excited by the idea of being the ultimate protector."
HaloStory,3bc22o,Dekar2401,5,Tue Jun 30 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"This was addressed in Halsey's Journal. What Noble Six had was a fragment of Cortana that was left behind to study the Forerunner device beneath Sword Base. The ""real"" Cortana was on the Autumn."
HaloStory,3bc22o,Defguru,5,Sun Jun 28 04:18:33 2015 UTC,Well that was a piece of her apparently. Halsey took a small piece to examine the forerunner artifact under the ONI base and that piece chose Noble 6 to escort her back to the Autumn to reunite with her greater self.

Although that last statement may not be true because if cryo sleep actually lets your body rest instead of freezing it in time, he would have been super winded from not getting any exercise for 3 weeks before being thrust back into rigorous action.

Will we ever see them in a game? I don't know. If we do I doubt they will be the main enemy. The Covenant has always been the main enemy. How could 343i involve them as an enemy in a game? Maybe make the Insurectionists fight alongside a covenant faction. It will definitely be interesting to see what 343i does with them in the future.

The UNSC didn't want to be involved until the CMA corruption was exposed, and the outer colonists wanted them to come in.   Ignoring the lower classes contributed heavily to the Insurrection's genesis. Colonists in the Outer Colonies rarely wanted to live under UNSC rule.

The only ones known to be pursuing conflict over peace was the leadership of the New Colonial Alliance.

HaloStory,3b9o7t,Sangheilioz,25,Sat Jun 27 12:31:42 2015 UTC,"Spartan-IIIs being better trained isn't actually a thing. Ackerson only said that when he was trying to push for the Spartan-III program to be approved. Keep in mind he also said there'd be thousands of Spartan-IIIs in a couple of decades in the same breath, and that never happened either. When you have 300 kids of varying ages being trained on a tighter budget (they're meant to be cheaper soldiers) to work as a large unit as opposed to being perfect commandos, you end up with less talent per capita. One thing that really stood out to me is in Spartan Ops where Halsey said ""first we taught them to be silent, then we taught them to be Spartans"". There's something fundamentally missing from the Spartan-III program that made them inferior soldiers to the Spartan-IIs, and this was evident from Noble Team's lack of respect when talking to Halsey in Halo: Reach.  As for the drug given to Gamma company to keep them going after they should have collapsed from shock, keep in mind that this also makes them go crazy if they're not given regular doses of an anti-drug to suppress them. Assuming they aren't going crazy, this will give them a better chance, but for the reasons I'm about to discuss I don't think it'll be enough to make a difference.  So, onto the actual comparison. I think if you're talking about CAT-IIs compared to Spartan-IIs there'd be a close fight and I can't give an answer. If you're talking about a regular Spartan-III vs a Spartan-II, no question the Spartan-II wins. Regular Spartan-IIIs are no larger than the average human, and as such they're at a distinct disadvantage in terms of physicality. The better genetics and natural talent of the Spartan-IIs also gives them the distinct advantage. A single Spartan-II was known to be the difference maker of entire battles on groundside; they're trained to be the perfect commando. Without a fireteam behind them, a single regular Spartan-III just doesn't have the makeup to make it close to an even battle."

HaloStory,3b9o7t,butwhysir,8,Wed Jul 1 14:47:06 2015 UTC,Noble Team's lack of respect when talking to Halsey in Halo: Reach.   Noble team didn't respect Halsey when they first meet (sans Jorge) because she hated them. It's not that they weren't trained well
HaloStory,3b9o7t,benhan23,8,Sat Jun 27 04:42:12 2015 UTC,"A well-trained soldier doesn't show disrespect to civilians. Spartan-IIs never showed such disrespect to anyone, eg John vs Del Rio. Del Rio gave him every reason in the book to snap back, but he didn't."
HaloStory,3b9o7t,tblots4,7,Sat Jun 27 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"Del Rio is far from a civilian, I doubt John would react the same way if a civilian was being so belligerent.   I thought Noble Team was pretty respectful considering how rude Halsey was being. Carter was just being terse and gave a pretty reasonable 'military threat' saying if you get in the way of my mission I'll have to put you in military jail or whatever, which is what an S-II would probably say as well (maybe not to Halsey, but another high ranking civilian). And Halsey WAS influencing the team by giving them new objectives and being verbally aggressive to influence them. Kurt was an S-II and he reacted the same way to Halsey on Onyx, when she was being 'alpha' and taking control of the mission.  I thought S-IIIs were mentally almost identical to S-IIs, I can't remember any other S-III being disrespectful except when that mute Spartan told Halsey to shut up (which I thought was totally out of character). It's their young training which makes them that way, being brought up like a spartan from 6-12 will give you insane discipline which will last throughout your entire life."
HaloStory,3b9o7t,E-Squid,4,Sat Jun 27 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"that mute Spartan told Halsey to shut up (which I thought was totally out of character).   Of course it was, but Traviss has that bizarre vendetta against Halsey, how could she pass up an opportunity like that?"
HaloStory,3b9o7t,Galmsortie17,0,Sat Jun 27 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"John disrespected Del Rio in Halo 4.  Not saying it was uncalled for, but Halsey was acting similarly pushy (though for better reasons)"
HaloStory,3b9o7t,BraveExpress2,8,Sun Jun 28 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"Spartan-IIIs being better trained isn't actually a thing. Ackerson only said that when he was trying to push for the Spartan-III program to be approved.   Ghosts of Onyx is pretty explicit that the Spartan-III training was better than the Spartan-II training.    In the last six months he had developed a training regime tougher than the original SPARTAN program.   Ghosts of Onyx, p.41   There's something fundamentally missing from the Spartan-III program that made them inferior soldiers to the Spartan-IIs, and this was evident from Noble Team's lack of respect when talking to Halsey in Halo: Reach.   I would argue this very differently, the Spartan-IIIs didn't have Halsey for a matriarch for ten years, but if they'd bumped into Kurt or Mendez under sword base, they would have treated them with the same reverence Jorge did for Halsey.   Otherwise, I'd argue you're pretty much on the money. In identical circumstances an average Spartan-II will take it over an average Spartan-III. I'd argue that MJOLNIR GEN2 would make it closer than you think especially with a Gamma Company Spartan-III, but yeah, this goes to the Spartan-II."
HaloStory,3b9o7t,benhan23,15,Sat Jun 27 04:28:49 2015 UTC,"Ghosts of Onyx is pretty explicit that the Spartan-III training was better than the Spartan-II training.  In the last six months he had developed a training regime tougher than the original SPARTAN program.   Only Ackerson said ""better trained"". Tougher training doesn't mean the soldiers will be better-trained. Mental fortitude, psychological makeup, physical prowess play a heavy factor into how well someone accepts their training. There's nothing to back up the claim that the Spartan-IIIs were better trained. In fact, there's more evidence to the contrary. During Operation PROMETHEUS it's noted by Kurt that in the twilight of Alpha Company's run, there was no unit cohesion, and no two-man teams covering one another. Spartan-IIs had no such issues when they were struggling to survive on Reach.   I would argue this very differently, the Spartan-IIIs didn't have Halsey for a matriarch for ten years, but if they'd bumped into Kurt or Mendez under sword base, they would have treated them with the same reverence Jorge did for Halsey.   It's not just about showing Halsey respect, specifically. Spartan-IIs were taught respect, Spartan-IIIs showed no restraint in loosing their tongues when they felt they needed to get their point across. Knowing the demeanours of the Spartan-IIs we know about, I see no reason to believe they've ever shown disrespect to anybody. For example, even when John was rejecting Del Rio's orders in Halo 4, and despite all the disrespect he was receiving from someone he didn't like, he had the ability to not snap back.   I'd argue that MJOLNIR GEN2 would make it closer than you think especially with a Gamma Company Spartan-III, but yeah, this goes to the Spartan-II.   I don't understand this at all. GEN2 MJOLNIR provides the largest boost in ability to the Spartan-IVs because of their lack of mechanical augmentations. Spartan-IIIs already got their augmentations, so the boost in ability they receive from GEN2 MJOLNIR will be matched, or exceeded, by the boost the Spartan-IIs receive. The gap in natural ability and physical strength will only be more evident as MJOLNIR builds on top of the foundation underneath. This is evidenced when Kelly was sparring with other Spartan-IIs (before Reach I think?). She was still much faster than them, despite the armour."
HaloStory,3b9o7t,BraveExpress2,3,Sat Jun 27 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"Tougher training doesn't mean the soldiers will be better-trained.    Yes, yes it does. You have the Spartan-II responsible for training the Spartan-IIIs and the person that trained the Spartan-IIs training the Spartan-IIIs. Kurt says explicitly that the Spartan-IIIs will have the best training, he handpicked the drill instructors and made sure they had every damn piece of equipment they needed. Spartan-IIIs training was without a doubt better.  Alpha Company did break down, after a week-long battle being constantly surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned, watching the people they grew up with slowly be massacred by a massive counter-offensive. All of them somewhere between the ages of nine and eleven.    It's not just about showing Halsey respect, specifically. Spartan-IIs were taught respect, Spartan-IIIs showed no restraint in loosing their tongues   Where exactly do you see this? Carter didn't quite snap at Halsey, he dealt with her in the cold, professional manner of a soldier with a job to do, Did Carter ever mouth off to Colonel Holland, who outranks him as Del Rio did the Chief?   This is a very weak argument.   I don't understand this at all. GEN2 MJOLNIR provides the largest boost in ability to the Spartan-IVs because of their lack of mechanical augmentations.

Does this mean that the soldiers turned out to be better? No, because like I said before, the ability to accept and ingrain the training is heavily influenced by the soldier's mental fortitude, psychological makeup, and physical prowess, all of which Spartan-II children were naturally in the upper echelon of human potential of. There's also the fact that Spartan-IIs didn't have a rushed timetable to be trained, so their training took place over a longer period of time which allowed it to work instinctively.   Alpha Company did break down, after a week-long battle being constantly surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned, watching the people they grew up with slowly be massacred by a massive counter-offensive. All of them somewhere between the ages of nine and eleven.   Bottom line, their training broke down. At the end of the day, the Spartan-IIs' training didn't on Reach (which was arguably more tragic of a situation), because they had longer time for the training to ingrain and mature, whereas the Spartan-IIIs didn't. So who turned out better trained? You can't expect only 5 years of training non-perfect children to match the 8 years of training the Spartan-IIs received.   This is a very weak argument.   I concede this point. Fair play.   You and me both. Where do you see that MJOLNIR GEN2 boosts more because of their lack of mechanical augmentation?   The nature of the GEN2 MJOLNIR was to bridge the gap that the missing augmentations left. This included the lack of neural augmentations in the Spartan-IVs, which was assisted via neural interface. The suit does all of that for them and brings them to the same level as Spartan-IIs (with neural augmentations) in GEN1 Mk VI armour. So to go from reaction time of a regular human to the reaction time of a Spartan-II in GEN1 armour sends a clear message that the armour works as it was designed for the Spartan-IVs.   I don't understand this sentence. Spartan-IIIs don't have any mechanical augmentations, so by your own logic (which I disagree with) they'd get more of a boost?   Again you misunderstood what I was saying. Spartan-IIIs do have the mechanical augmentations, thus they will not receive an extra boost in abilities via GEN2 MJOLNIR like the Spartan-IVs would. Thus the increase in strength, speed, and so on from MJOLNIR will be no more than the boost that the Spartan-IIs would receive from the armour. The Spartan-IIs were much better outside armour, so MJOLNIR would build on top of the stronger foundation that is inside the suit. Spartan-IIIs weren't comparatively all that great outside of armour, so MJOLNIR has less of a foundation to work on."

This is exactly what I'm arguing. I think we've discussed this before, but if not, I subscribe to the II > III >> IV theory. Overall I'd argue that the training balances out with the additional time the Spartan-IIs had (although with Gamma, this could be as little as one year). There is pretty explicit evidence in Ghosts of Onyx that the Spartan-III training was just better. Not Spartan-IIIs overall, but the training.   Bottom line, their training broke down. At the end of the day, the Spartan-IIs' training didn't on Reach (which was arguably more tragic of a situation), because they had longer time for the training to ingrain and mature, whereas the Spartan-IIIs didn't. So who turned out better trained? You can't expect only 5 years of training non-perfect children to match the 8 years of training the Spartan-IIs received.   Something I should have emphasized more is that Alpha was ten years old and If they had thirty years of experience, as the Spartan-IIs on Reach did they would have done even better than they did.

Spartan-IVs have reaction time boosting augments: the ""super-myelinated"" reaction system. The neural implant they have is the same as all UNSC soldiers, unless they get upgraded to handle an AI. MJOLNIR has always boosted reaction time. GEN2 just boosts it more than GEN1 does. Their neural interface doesn't boost their reaction time, the armour does.

Including all three modern generations of Spartans.  Maybe I'm still misinterpreting, so explain it to me as simple as you can: What mechanical augmentation do the Spartan-IIIs have and what does it do?"
HaloStory,3b9o7t,benhan23,4,Sat Jun 27 10:14:16 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm arguing.   Well then, we're on the same page I guess. Spartan-IIs are better in that they accepted 8 years of training better, but the Spartan-IIIs had higher quality training, but with far less time spent in it.   Something I should have emphasized more is that Alpha was ten years old and If they had thirty years of experience, as the Spartan-IIs on Reach did they would have done even better than they did.   It's not just the lack of experience though, 5 years clearly wasn't enough for them to instinctively fall back to training. The instinctive quality of the training takes time, and the Spartans at 14 (not the fall of Reach obviously, but different time) showed a much better demeanour in terms of instincts when the going got tough. But yeah they definitely would have done better if they were more experienced, but I still don't think the experience would put their training instincts over that of the Spartan-IIs.   Spartan-IVs have reaction time boosting augments: the ""super-myelinated"" reaction system. The neural implant they have is the same as all UNSC soldiers, unless they get upgraded to handle an AI. MJOLNIR has always boosted reaction time. GEN2 just boosts it more than GEN1 does. Their neural interface doesn't boost their reaction time, the armour does.   OK the ""super-myelinated"" detail is something I didn't know about yet because I haven't had the time to read New Blood. I was going by the assumption that that was what Frank O'Connor was referencing when he said ""mechanical augmentations"", because Halo: Initiation never mentioned a neural augmentation. I think I'll concede this point until I go back to the drawing board to figure this out.

I think I'm the one misinterpreting ""mechanical augmentations"". If this is in contrast with the chemical augmentations that the Spartan-IIIs and -IVs received then I've got the wrong idea, because all of the Spartan-III augmentations that we know about are chemical because that was deemed the safest way to administer it (it's still possible that the CAT-IIs received some sort of growth catalyst because of their comparatively substantial size). Is ""mechanical augmentations"" just the more invasive techniques that were used on the Spartan-IIs then? Does this confirm that the supposed ""quantum leap"" in research only means the mortality rate was drastically reduced, but yield was actually less potent?  Back to the point though, you said that GEN2 MJOLNIR would make it a closer fight. I don't understand this because both the Spartan-II and Spartan-III in question would receive the same armour, and like I said before MJOLNIR builds on top of the soldier's abilities outside of armour. Thus, the Spartan-III would not see as great a boost in ability in comparison to the Spartan-II, meaning that they'd still be vastly outclassed even in armour.  On a side note, based on Frank O'Connor's comment on a Spartan-IV in GEN2 MJOLNIR being on par with Spartan-II in GEN1 Mk VI, are we both on the same page that putting a Spartan-II in GEN2 MJOLNIR would significantly increase their operational capacity as well?  edit: by the way, I didn't downvote your other comment and I don't appreciate that people are doing that. We're having a pretty fine discussion in my opinion."

I disagree, the Spartan-IIIs training was burned into them, Ghosts of Onyx is filled with references like:   ""Tom reacted without thought; a lifetime of training took over.""    I haven't re-read Fall of Reach but my impression of the raid on the asteroid base in the Eridanus II system was that it was very small scale, and rushed (almost panicked) pace.  Don't get me wrong, the Spartan-IIs, at age fourteen, essentially walked into an enemy stronghold, grabbed their leader and walked out. I just don't think engaging and killing 7 guards can compare to putting down an entire insurrection on Mamore, or fighting off thousands of Covenant troops for a week. If the Spartan-IIs had been augmented at 12, and deployed on missions of similar scale I don't think they would have done as well as the Spartan-IIIs did (this is taking into account the 300 v. 33 and any other factors).   OK the ""super-myelinated"" detail is something I didn't know about yet because I haven't had the time to read New Blood.

I think I'll concede this point until I go back to the drawing board to figure this out.   I would definitely recommend New Blood lot of cool insights into the Spartan-IV augmentation and training program. Fair warning, though: There are three-four chapters you can just outright skip if you've played ODST. The chapters are very awkwardly written so I'd actually recommend skipping them.   I think I'm the one misinterpreting ""mechanical augmentations"".

Does this confirm that the supposed ""quantum leap"" in research only means the mortality rate was drastically reduced, but yield was actually less potent?   A mechanical augmentation would be an implanted machine. The only things I think explicitly qualify are the Spartan-IIs thyroid implant and the Spartan-IVs corneal implants. You could maybe argue some of the other Spartan-IV augments, but not enough data to be sure right now.   Back to the point though, you said that GEN2 MJOLNIR would make it a closer fight.

Thus, the Spartan-III would not see as great a boost in ability in comparison to the Spartan-II, meaning that they'd still be vastly outclassed even in armour.   I think this falls to a difference of opinion. My rationale for this is that Spartan-IIIs, even an average Spartan-III is close enough to a Spartan-II that MJOLNIR GEN2 makes it negligible. Without getting too specific, spoiler wise in New Blood Spoiler Warning. So strength wise, they're hitting like a truck, reaction time should be comparable, etc.  From what I've read, you think Spartan-IIIs aren't quite as close as I do.   On a side note, based on Frank O'Connor's comment on a Spartan-IV in GEN2 MJOLNIR being on par with Spartan-II in GEN1 Mk VI, are we both on the same page that putting a Spartan-II in GEN2 MJOLNIR would significantly increase their operational capacity as well?   I agree with this, and given all we knew up until last week's canon fodder it would be correct.  My opinion is in the process of changing with the recent revelation that both Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris wear GEN2 in Halo 5, as that seems to imply that it either doesn't do as much for Blue Team or their GEN2 was deliberately nerfed to bring them into line. Given what we know about ""Stolen Gauntlet"" it's entirely possible."
HaloStory,3b9o7t,benhan23,2,Sat Jun 27 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"We'll agree to disagree then. I think the training that the Spartan-IIs received was much more complete than the Spartan-IIIs, and the only thing stopping them from completing the Spartan-III suicide missions would be pure numbers. They'd follow their training to their dying breath, and not fall out of their training instincts when the going got tough. Your comparison of them at age 12 and being deployed on similar missions as the Spartan-III is ridiculous frankly. 33 would never be sent on such a mission when only the numbers that the Spartan-IIIs had could possibly have made success a remote possibility. That's like saying if you drop 1 Spartan-III in SPI armour into a mission that was designed for a single Spartan-II in MJOLNIR they would not do well. No shit, you've described a bunch of limitations that are set outside the bounds of what they were meant for."

You are right, however as I should've qualified ""given equivalent equipment"" as well.   To be summative, all things equal (gear, mission, etc) at age 12, 33 Spartan-IIIs would outperform the 33 Spartan-IIs.
