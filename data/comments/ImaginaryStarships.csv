ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,Antal_Marius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:45 2015 UTC,In the description the artist explains why the RCS thrusters are so massive
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,nyrath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:47:27 2015 UTC,"Well, makes sense for a giant warship, but one good missile hit to one of those booms, and you're not gonna be jinking so much."
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,Antal_Marius,3,Mon Jul 20 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"Since the missiles have nuclear warheads, one good missile hit means vaporized warship.  A warship has to jink because the first rule of combat is Don't Get Hit. Anything you can do to complicate the enemy's targeting solution increases survivability."
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,nyrath,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:58 2015 UTC,"It states that there also exists shrapnel missiles, if one of those get a boom, then the ship's done for when that nuke behind it gets the ship."
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,Antal_Marius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"I know that William included kinetic kill weapons in the description. He consults with me when designing his ships. I am the ""Winchell Chung"" he mentions.  The point is that the size of the booms is not making the ship significantly easier to hit with your weapons fire (""simplifying your targeting solution"").  If the RCS are not on booms, the lever arm over which they exert their force is drastically reduced. This slows the speed with which the main drive can be rotated into a new random direction in order to jink.  You do not see NASA ships with RCS on booms because they are rarely in combat. But they were used in the design of the Starfury fighter in the TV show Babylon 5.  If a ship does not jink, it is a sitting duck. It will be rapidly destroyed because the targeting solution is trivial. The fact its silhouette is slightly smaller because it has no booms does not make it any harder to hit. No jinking means its position at any future point in time can be precisely calculated.  If the ship is hit by a nuke, it will be vaporized. If is hit by a kinetic-kill weapon it will probably be mission-killed. Either way the ship will be neutralized. One of the best ways to avoid being hit is jinking. Not putting the RCS on booms will hurt far more than it will help."
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,nyrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that having the booms is degrading the ships performance, I fully agree that it's vital for it to survive, but if a boom takes a hit and malfunctions, the ship is as good as dead.  I'm guessing they have superior sensors (compared to our somewhat simple radar) to find and detect debris that might impact the booms and move out of the way before any damage occurs?"
ImaginaryStarships,3dwn56,Antal_Marius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:05 2015 UTC,"Well, not to to put too fine a point on it, but the warship's arrays of radar, lidar, optical sensors, infrared detectors, and other sensors that it uses to detect hostile incoming weapons fire can also be used to detect debris that might impact the ship. Any part of the ship, not just the booms.  Even now ground based radar can track orbital debris as small as one centimeter in diameter.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#Tracking_and_measurement"

ImaginaryStarships,3cd9f8,tahrox,8,Tue Jul 7 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"It's from a TV show called The 100. It's pretty good. Takes awhile for all the pieces to get into place and for things to get really interesting, but it's a pretty big payoff, and I recommend checking it out."
ImaginaryStarships,3cd9f8,tgiokdi,2,Tue Jul 7 03:14:53 2015 UTC,"Takes awhile for all the pieces to get into place   I was profoundly surprised at how quickly they moved the story along.  if this was any other show they'd still be figuring out how to communicate with the creatures on the ground, not where they are now."
ImaginaryStarships,3cd9f8,cajbazhaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:49:54 2015 UTC,"When Breaking Bad first came out I expected that flash-forward scene in episode one of Walt and Jessie with the camper in the desert to take place at the end of the season, not the end of the first episode. With shows like that, and True Detective, etc stamping out the new gold standard for television, it's often better to assume that people won't be as patient as you might expect with any given pilot episode. It's that phenomenon where you show your friends a song you really like, and you have to keep reminding them that it ""gets really good in just a second,"" to combat their looks of disinterest. That's partially due to over-selling the content from the get go, and partially due to how, even supposing that the song does actually get really good in just a second, quick people are to make up their minds about something. Personally, I was hooked since the first episode, but I think a lot of the more recent content blows that out of the water, so even if the first few episodes seem just ""okay"" to some people, I want to preemptively urge them to stick with it. And so maybe The 100 didn't dive in quite as quickly or with as much gusto as Breaking Bad or True Detective, but you're right, the story is pretty quick, and I'd rather surprise people with that opinion, than promise people that they'll also share it."
ImaginaryStarships,3cd9f8,christo334,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:53 2015 UTC,I got through two episodes and just couldn't watch anymore for a society that was all about conservation they were sure wasted a lot of resources killing people.
ImaginaryStarships,3cd9f8,christo334,6,Tue Jul 7 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"Not as many resources as they saved, though, right? They think they're the last survivors of the human race, and they already have a culture of death for the good of the many. Many of those kids would have been floated already if they had been adults when they committed their various crimes. I've heard some of my more conservative acquaintances joke that they should just said all of the prisoners into space in a rocket, well here's a society pushed to the point where they actually have to do so essentially. I'm not saying it's for everyone, what I am saying is that even if the first two episodes didn't do it for you, that doesn't mean you wouldn't like it if you kept up with it, got a better feel for it, the characters, their motivations, who they are, in what ways they'll have to adapt. It's cool if you're not into it, indeed it's not even my top favorite show out there, but I don't want your oversimplified comment to turn people off who might really get a kick out of the show."

ImaginaryStarships,3547jp,FoxtrotZero,2,Thu May 7 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, mostly because visual recognition is meaningless in space. Firstly, it's unreliable, as your perception is easily fucked with, but mostly, it's superfluous. It's worth noting that what you're referring to, called dazzle camoflage, was useful because it made it hard to estimate a ship's heading and speed. Once more advanced rangefinding systems (including RADAR) showed up, and with more advanced fire-solution computers (mostly big mechanical beasts, but sophisticated nonetheless), it stopped being used.  Any sort of military vessel not designed to run silently (which would involve very impressive heat sinking ability) is going to be a christmas tree in the infrared spectrum. People, reactors, heat sinks, radiators, drives, you name it. This is pretty much unavoidable. IR is going to be your passive system, much like vision would work. On top of that you're still succeptible to RADAR and LADAR systems (LADAR is a concept I'm taking from mass effect here, but it's basically RADAR with lasers - therefore more precise)."
ImaginaryStarships,3547jp,dziban303,2,Thu May 7 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"LADAR   You mean LIDAR.   Anyway, dazzle camouflage, in both wars, was primarily meant to defeat submarines, which don't usually have the luxury of using radar.   As you said, since estimating the target's heading and speed were necessary (to accurately aim torpedoes), anything which could obfuscate those data were judged to be worth the cost of paint.   Secondarily, camouflage patterns could be used to confuse an observer as to the ship's class. There were numerous examples of paint schemes being applied to make a certain cruiser type appear to be a different class or type altogether, like a destroyer, and so on.  ~Your /r/WarshipPorn mod"
ImaginaryStarships,3547jp,spankaway,1 point,Thu May 7 13:27:14 2015 UTC,"The distances and sensors involved would make it unlikely that dazzle camouflage would be effective. Mk 1 eyeball isn't going to be all that useful in space warfare, I think."

Also I seem to remember the ships having several meters of armour plating, that might account for some of the bulk.  Got any other pictures? I'd love to see more."

Casualties are minimal, though several systems are take offline by generator #3's core being knocked out of alignment with its shielding. Station sends a distress signal, and a number of tugs arrive in time to drag the station into a low, but stable, orbit around the black hole. The acceleration stresses the station's structure, causing several amber-grade warnings and the total separation of HR's tower, which falls into the black hole.  All in all, about 504 men and women died, but the station survived - barely. Reactor #3 is still offline - heavy construction mechs being needed to enter the shielding and reposition the core. Repair crews are coming in from as far off as Sigma Tau 9, but it will be many months before things are back to normal.  No one understands the sudden appearance of the black hole - which the work crews have nicknamed ""Susan"" - but everyone hopes that no more freak astronomical disasters occur."

Definition: The most powerful weapon in the terms of destructive force in this particular story/campaign. The power generated by this weapon is derived from the jump drive and attempts to create a jump field into its intended target. Since the field lacks the proper expansion the field destabilizes its an unstable black hole and rips the target apart and then explodes.   That is the intended definition. I haven't started the campaign yet to determine how realistic that may at least sound. Right now I am just creating the ships in part because I enjoy drawing.

This is what ends it before it even begins. the MAC cannons fire up to about 2% to 12% of the speed of light while the covenant weapon is so slow one destroyer was able to outmaneuver it and send it into another covenant vessel (more on this later) this means that the unsc can engage the covenant from further distances and don't talk about shields this is using real world physics so they would just be good for dispersing plasma or bricking missiles.    the unsc vessels have a lower heat sig most likely with some ships able to sneak right up to covenant fleets and deploy Spartans (who make a big mess of things). their plasma weapons seem to be heat guided as a unsc destroyer manged to disengage it and have it lock onto a smaller covenant ship this also gives them a decisive advantage as they can detect covenant ships before they are detected and fire first.  and if that doesn't work most ships in the unsc have upwards of 1200 nuclear missiles ready to launch at a moments notice and even if the Shields could stop them i doubt they could stop the power of a sun if only for a brief moment. then theres the emp effect and if the point defense is too strong they just detonate missiles to make way for the rest   TL;DR newton hates halo

ImaginaryStarships,301a2w,ericbyo,2,Tue Mar 24 01:04:31 2015 UTC,"In the long term the humans had the upper hand, the covenant could only copy what they found from forerunners so they had way ahead tech compared to humans.

Especially the Nexus-esque feeling of 3D space and the interesting camera controls that seem like they'd work pretty well. And graphically, it's gorgeous.  What will it actually be, though? Is it a story-driven RTT game, with a set number of ships, like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident? Is it a Homeworld-style RTS, with resource gathering and the like? Is it a 4X game like Sins of a Solar Empire? Or something else entirely?"
ImaginaryStarships,2x3152,Rather_Unfortunate,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be a more traditional RTS with some unique twists. Since this is a space RTS, we can't use terrain to make combat interesting. No lances, cliff choke points, or anything like that. So we need to bring in some new things to make the emptiness of space not empty.   There will be some 4x elements in it, but I don't quite know yet if we can fully call it a 4x. Depends on how some of our different ideas fall into place.   The simplest way of describing it would be as a mix of Homeworld and Nexus with some new elements to fix some of the flaws of those games."

ImaginaryStarships,2rkatp,JustAGamerA,3,Wed Jan 7 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"One of the best ships in the game, visually and functionally. It doesn't really fit with the rest of EVE's aesthetic in my opinion, but I love mine."
ImaginaryStarships,2rkatp,Misaniovent,3,Wed Jan 7 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"the SOE ships really remind me of the corellian corvette from the first episode of star wars. they share a lot of geometry and have a damn near identical paint scheme. I mean look at it. I really love what CCP did with both the SOE and Mordu's Legion ships, because they look so unique and aren't even slightly visually influenced by the main faction's aesthetics like the other faction ships are. ever since the introduction of the new destroyers (especially the algos and the corax, two of the best looking ships in the game) it feels like CCP's art department has been working on overdrive. now they just have to redo the capital ships."

ImaginaryStarships,2rkeu3,Kokamo_Joe,1 point,Wed Jan 7 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"the noctis from eve online is the first thing that came to my mind. nicely designed and with dingy colour palette it has quite a lot of character. the spinning segment on the neck of the ship is a nice touch too, which I feel adds a little personality (I'm a sucker for big moving parts on spaceships). It is, however, something like 800 metres in length, which might not be the best setting for a short story.  here's the best video of one in the game. and it's kind of a cool little story in of itself."
ImaginaryStarships,2r9rqj,Lol33ta,2,Sun Jan 4 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"Theseus is one ugly purely-functional hack of a ship.  And I love it. Maybe something is wrong with me - I've ruined my sense of aesthetics by spending too long in the thin abstracted world of numbers. But something about the raw efficacy of it speaks to me. When the pieces are there not because it would be pretty, but because they need to be, they can run away and do something amazing you'd never think of. It's the difference between ""Should it be there? Should it be shaped so radically?"" and ""It must be. It will be. No, further. It shall go further."" It's like the difference between your dream girl (or guy), who will always be yours and cannot leave the walled garden of your imagination, and reality, which you cannot control, which can fight back, and can take you beyond, to the cold dark and the hard light. It is the artistic direction in the laws of the universe, incomprehensibly sweeping us ever forward into unknowable territory. It's the alien beauty of a deep-sea jelly, or a monstrously spiked succulent plant. So, if you like, call me an aesthetic masochist.  The book (Blindsight) is hard sci-fi and it's always been more about the words for me than the pretty pictures, but other fans of Peter Watts have proven to be great artists. There's this impression by a friend of the author, with its spindly high-performance cut-down look, like it's hungry, knows where it's going, and is going there fast. Then there's the author's canonical look, or rather, a sculptor's take on the canonical look, which reminds me of the Discovery from 2001. To get a bit artsier, there's a dust jacket for the combined Blindsight/Echopraxia omnibus edition, featuring Theseus along with Crown of Thorns, which features in the sequel.  You want functional form? Here's a real spaceship: IKAROS, deploying a fifty-foot solar sail, 7.5 micrometers thin."

Like even the minor design parts still have major functions but what they are I don't know. Example being the long pointy bits. And the engine curve ontop of the main engine."

ImaginaryStarships,2pxv0s,giaa262,2,Sun Dec 21 16:43:24 2014 UTC,Reminds me of an old game called Whipeout Fusion or Swoops from starwars.
ImaginaryStarships,2p31rn,ethan_kahn,2,Fri Dec 12 15:23:10 2014 UTC,"""I understand you have to make a living but really, are you gonna pass up money now for just a chance at money in another 4 Cycles?""  Arniss knew he had him. If the deactivating of most of the implants in the brains of the people of the Sun Valley did anything it made them greedy. And just like hunting in the Low Plains, a reward upfront seemed to always be the best lure. He could almost hear the recalculator circuits whirring and buzzing along as his business minded friend ran the numbers a few hundred more times. A system meant to verify and test calculations for space jumps was now being used to make sure he got the best return investment on his scrap.  The scrap was an older Phoenix Starchaser 150. Built for mid impact solar exploration it was one of the few ships that survived the landing of the first crews 50 some odd years ago. Dual suns, bitter cold at night and harsh shrapnel filled sandstorms wreaked havoc on the ships. But some were built for rougher times and with the additional help of the cave network of the Sun Valley they could be kept from the unforgiving environment. As soon as the Trader accepted the low price he quoted and gave the OK, Arniss would be one step closer to get off of the planet.  The projected visage on the helmet-screen flickered and for a brief moment he could see the lights and pixels that comprised it's predetermined face. A blue light glowed and even before the traders face could materialize and speak, Arniss knew the answer. Blue meant a ""Conditional Yes"" and conditions from Sun Valley traders always meant the impossible.  As the face bounced back like an old television set flipping channels, he beat him to the punch. ""Fine, what do you want?"" Arniss tried to sound less annoyed and impatient, but even the cyborg knew better ""We require a map."" He responded with a lack of emotion that Arniss could never duplicate. ""I aint no cartographer man,  you know that. I  navigate and I do it well."" ""Mr Arniss you are a scavenger and if you are to take this vessel to the Dead Sun then we will require a detailed map be made of your expedition. We care not for your goals or purpose there, we simply require the information when you return.""  Arniss squinted as he stared just past the flaming ball of heat beating down on them both. He tried to work it out in his head.  It was too late to start haggling with someone else. The Sun would be too far away in a few days. The new sun would begin the bombardment again that would go on for years. Years of restricted time outside or risking lethal doses of radiation. Years of no travel of any kind and especially any flight, or or off world. His window was now. He knew he would accept the deal, so did the trader. But that didn't stop him for trying to find a sweet spot in the deal.  ""Its a deal. Ill bring a map when I bring her back. She just better be in good shape like you said. ""  Details were passed back and forth and arrangements made for delivery. As he walked away Arniss tried to talk himself into a better state of mind about the deal. But the more good points he made, the more bad snuck in. Soon he was right back to square one with the sick feeling in his stomach that something was going to kill him on that floating celestial corpse. That dead sun was going to be the death of him too."
