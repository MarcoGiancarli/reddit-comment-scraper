CruciblePlaybook,3e3zz7,vote4mclovin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:48 2015 UTC,This is very well thought out. I'm going to go over the map points before I go into rumble again. I've gone from 3 wins to 47 in a couple weeks playing only a handful every other day or so.   The key for me is not to get frustrated and tunnel vision so I play until I stop enjoying it and move on to something else. My biggest weakness is map control or lockdown. There's been to many games I'm literally running circles trying to find someone to kill while someone else just stacks kills.

CruciblePlaybook,3e3zz7,Halcyon_On_And_On,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"I actually think you're underrating the Sunsinger. The way you use Sunsinger in team-based modes is usually to spam grenades, right?   In Rumble, I really liked just using Radiant Skin and then still using my guns. What you get is 220% health with Radiant Skin, meaning that if you're using a shotgun or a faster-killing primary you gain an automatic advantage. The grenades are just a bonus as far as Rumble goes.  The thing about Sunsinger that makes it so unique is that you can still use your guns (I know Defender can too and I'll go over that in a second). Take advantage of that as opposed to the grenades.  The Defender isn't for staying in your bubble in most gamemodes. It's about the buff. If you're using Weapons or Blessing, set up your bubble in the area of the map you're holding down, and then just move back to the bubble when the buff is about to end. Similar to the Sunsinger, it just gives a gunfight advantage. The Defender stuff is all on paper but I have seen successful Defender rumble play (look up InvictaTV from the Inclement team, he was top 10 in Rumble with a Defender).  Very good guide overall. Really well made and great effort."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3zz7,Noteful,2,Tue Jul 21 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying about Sunsinger. Radiant Skin gives you a clear advantage for any 1v1 encounter, but you can get Fist of Panic'ed, or Golden Gun'ed or Voidbomb'ed before you even get a single kill with Radiance. You have to assume that if you have your Super, then 5 other people have theirs too. I'm not say its bad, but for the average Crucible player, the other classes are easier to win with."

CruciblePlaybook,3e4ply,flphinatic,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"Nicely done. Our 8-0 was destroyed yesterday by shotpackage, radiance and an insane dedication to revive no matter what. It paid off because I was nervous about getting my friends to the lighthouse for the first time and I choked. As a team we were unprepared to counter those tactics without my blinky shotty skillz at max.  One observation; the first few rounds you were blindsided and should probably watch the motion tracker more. It's way better than eyes. When you played passively, you also seemed to utilize cover much better."

The other two players are weaker so I have them stay close to each other. I tend to be the lone wolf...

If you aren't ready for me I am going to fly in like a bat out of hell as soon as I hear gunfire and you'll catch a shotgun to the side of the head.   Find an open area to lead an aggressive rushing team to and know what routes they are coming from; due to latency call outs sometimes won't help in time so your team needs to aim well, be on the ball, and pay attention"
CruciblePlaybook,3e4ply,joker103,0,Wed Jul 22 01:23:42 2015 UTC,Struggling that bad against guys whose k/d is .8 simply because they have shotguns and rush is a bad sign.
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,invisigrrl,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how much time do you spend playing PvP in general? I think a lot of decision making comes not only from maintaining a cool head but also just lots and lots of experience. People can provide the best tips and tricks in the world but at the end of the day it's a shit load of practice with those tips that really makes the difference. I know that's not the most fun answer and it's certainly not the easiest, but that's what a lot of it does boil down to."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,FacelessGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting point,  I've spent more time playing crucible the past couple of weeks then I have before.   I know a lot does come down to experience and I am trying to keep a cool head,  but meh panic sets in!   The end game is all about crucible for me at the moment and I plan on spending a lot more time in crucible for the foreseeable future,  there's only so many PoE you can complete."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,FacelessGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:26 2015 UTC,"Panicking and playing in a reactionary manner go away with experience, for sure. Back in the days of Halo 2 when I got on XBL for the first time, I would get the jitters before every match and tended to freak out the closer the enemy got to me.   Active and passive learning has to take place. So actively seeking tips, watching gameplay of skilled players, and trying to put them into practice is definitely important. On the more passive end you just need to observe your own gameplay as it happens. It took me a while coming from a very casual mindset to begin looking at what I could have done better in any given situation rather than just swear at my screen and move on to make the same mistakes over and over again."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,rsdon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  I've started to reflect on my gaming and I feel stupid being 30+ trying to git gud at a game!  The swearing still happens and I have been watching slayerage and the usual lot especially when trials is on to try and work out strategies for the team I'm in. I can't handle being rushed by 3 people but am maintaining a little bit of control in 1v1 encounters. I do have epic moments sometimes.  Usually when I've found an inner calm."

From unique map positioning to the way i move in cqcb. If you're hitting a wall i highly suggest joining a clan and focusing on learning to work as a team.  Teamwork is when you get to that next level.
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,EA_Forum_Moderator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"That's why Salvage is happening this week,  working as a team to hopefully get some wins. Not 6 v 6 as too many things to call out, I do OK in trials but it's the odd encounters where panic sets in."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,jamarax,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"The only way to get over that panic/exited feeling is to practice.  This is true in any competition, you want to develop muscle memory to the point that it's almost reflex for you.  It's most recognizable as being able to respond and make decisions and executing without thinking about how to do it.      This is true for all forms of competition.    Trials is a different animal altogether.  Trials is not regular PvP.  And, even Elimination nor Salvage is similar to Trials.  They are the closest you can come in regular Crucible play, but the pacing and strategy of Trials is way different.  I wouldn't let your personal performance in Trials demoralize you, it's how your team performs that matters.  Even when I'm dead, I can help my team win by communicating well, call outs, telling them which direction to turn or shoot...stuff like that.  Your KDR doesn't have to positive every round, you just need to contribute to your team's success.   (On another note, I feel that unless I am playing with people who are very familiar with Trials that I end up playing two or three cards with a team just to get used to them.)    My advice to you is to take your Trials setup and play Rumble.  Rumble ends up being a lot of 1v1 battles, sometimes you get unlucky and have someone pick you off right after you win a 1v1.  Sometimes though, you run into a 1v2 or 1v3.  Sound familiar?  If you get used to winning battles like that in Rumble, you are going to be able to do it in Trials.   And the reason to take your Trials setup in...you get used to the Strengths and Weaknesses of your gear.  It's no good to play Crucible with a full INT/DIS build, then get messed up in Trials because suddenly you have 115 Str and only 80& DIS because you are suddenly wearing a Light Beyond Nemesis (or somesuch).    If you play on XB1, pm me and I'll give you my gamer tag.  I play PvP almost every night (pacific time) unless I am helping my friends do PvE stuff.  I'm more than willing to practice/play with anybody.  I'm not the best at Crucible, but I am dedicated; and am very used to competition and competitive mental training."
CruciblePlaybook,3e3pad,BIgTrickBrady,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"This might come off as mean but w/e.  I don't understand how you think you do ok.  You say you watch videos and you ""know"" about certain things but you aren't executing it.  You think you know, but you really don't.  If right now you're getting defensive and saying you do know just trust me you really don't.  It's not what you know, it's what you don't know and you don't know a lot of things.   I think you have to re-evaluate your skill level and figure out what you're doing wrong on your own because as it stands you think you're OK but apparently your teammates don't.    You're literally the classical ""noob."" Your most weapons used on your gunslinger is super/shotgun/handcannon, your warlock melee/shotgun/grenades (solar or fusion?), and your titan shotgun/melee/super.  Those stats are the trademark of pretty much every single player that has a K/D similar to yours.  You can't even use heavy weapons properly.  Use DestinyTracker from here on out to look at your match history, it tells you on a game to game basis exactly what weapons you killed people with.   Start concentrating on using a primary for most of your kills, secondary next, then heavy ammo.  Don't count on your super as a guaranteed kill.  Stop using melee.  Stop getting in melee range.  Whatever you need to do to get kills with a primary just do it.     Looks like you have problems aiming or making decisions that lead to you getting crosshairs on target since you can't consistently shoot something at distance.  If you're playing on a large TV try find a smaller monitor 22-24 inches.  Obviously you mostly use shotguns (cqc weapon) and it appears you spam/panic melee when that fails or when the enemy is in too close and you lose position.  Super is your only guaranteed kills.   I don't know what factors in to your decision making.  I don't know if you're just running around aimlessly until you see red on radar, then trying to figure out where they are.  By time you see them they're on top of you and you start panicking blindly melee'ing if you can't shotgun.    However you're currently trying to get kills right now just stop.  Whatever method of play is currently in your head when you're going for a kill just stop.  Did you spawn in and switch to shotgun?  Stop.  Did you switch to shotgun as soon as you saw red on the minimap and have yet to see where the enemy is?  Stop.  Did you see the enemy and they're currently out of shotgun range and you ran more than 2 seconds to get into shotgun range to kill them?  Stop.  Do you ever crouch in a corner and wait for a kill to walk by?  Stop.  Whenever someone is in melee range or close to it are you trying to melee?  Missing a lot of melees?  Seriously, stop and do whatever it takes to make sure you kills are with (primary) weapons.   When someone is on top of you are you spinning around trying to find them?  Stop.  Just pick a direction to go, and run away in a straight line until they're no longer on top of you (2nd node on radar) then turn around and shoot them with something.   Every single time you spawn in now just sit there, count to 10, and see if you can figure out where the enemy is without moving.  Not just one enemy.  Try figure out where the entire enemy team is.  You mentioned Salvage and that's great, you only have to figure out where three people are.  You shouldn't need radar to know where the enemy is.  You don't need to go find them using the radar.  You need to find them with game knowledge then use radar to find their exact position.  On open maps especially you should have cross hairs on them before you notice them on radar.   When you spawn in:   Find something you can strafe behind (not crouch) in case you get in a gunfight.  Most people spawn in and starting running around in the middle of nowhere.  Then move, and every time you move somewhere take a mental note of all the angles you can get shot from, where the enemy should be, what they'll be shooting you with, where you can move to not get shot, and how you can avoid dying. Count how many lanes are around you (more than one way to go somewhere), how many lanes you can go down, how many lanes your teammates are in (tells you where enemy is spawning) How many teammates are currently in a gunfight -- tells you where an enemy is What the enemy score is -- tells you who has super which is relevant around heavy ammo spawns. What guns are they using -- determines the length that they can engage you.  Snipers = stay out of sniping lanes, move slow.  Shotguns = stay out of shotgun range and stay away from corners.  Thorn = run if they get one shot on you and you haven't shot them yet.  TLW = stay at distance, run once you realize you're going to lose a lot of health.  What the most likely method they would use to kill you right now where you're currently standing -- Medium to far distance = primary/sniper  = always be close to something to hide behind so you don't get shot.  Close to a corner = shotgun = either have a way to attack the corner or get off the corner. What weapon did the player you're looking at just kill you with?  What weapons did they have equipped loading into the game?  What weapon has been showing up on the kill feed the most for that player?  Don't let them use that weapon at a distance they want to. Who the strongest player on your team is -- either back them up or don't screw them over.  Where you last died -- no need to rush back over there. Why you last died -- did they outplay you? Most likely not.  So don't mess up like that again. Where did they last kill you from -- have they been sitting there all game or do they move around? Where you are planning on going, did you go that way last time you spawned here?  What happened last time you spawned/went that way? What weapon you'd need to use if someone appeared in a lane at a certain distance -- Do you have a grenade up?  If not how long till it's up?   It's not a guessing game.  You should actually know this.  There's no rush to go anywhere or kill anyone.  You're obviously not great at killing stuff so try to get better at not dying, then figure out the killing part.  For good players red on radar means something to kill, for you it means something that's going to kill you."

Here is a clip of a tripmine that sticks to someone. It does 3 damage on impact, and 194 damage from the explosion. That is a total of 197 damage, which is not over 203 damage. Therefore, it is possible for people with high enough armor to survive it. Also, I have never seen anyone survive a shoulder charge that is not using the ram, super, or an overshield. If you pause this video at 00:39 seconds or during any of the other shoulder charges you will see it does 200 damage. Therefore, excluding special cases, a persons health+shield range cannot exceed 200.  You should take a look at the article that is linked. It goes it to great detail."

CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,Promethium,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:39 2015 UTC,"I use that spreadsheet all the time, it's awesome! Thanks to /u/exxtrooper. Maybe he/she can enlighten us as to how he/she arrived at that data? And if he/she agrees with what I've posted above, perhaps he/she can change it within the spreadsheet? :D. In any case, according to the research above, those values are not correct. It would imply that titans and warlocks could survive a shoulder charge with enough armor. The only way to survive a shoulder charge based on armor alone is with the ram helmet.   Also, did you watch the video I posted? Sticking a tripmine grenade to someone does 3 damage plus 194. As I stated in the post, those values may not be exact and are most likely rounded. So it could be between 2.5+193.5 = 196, or 3.499+194.499 = 197.998. There is no debate about that right? So for the sake of argument, even if the values in the spreadsheet are correct, a max armor titan should be able to survive a tripmine still.  Again, I would highly encourage you to read the article I posted. It would answer any doubts that you seem to have."

CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,MythicIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I have been summoned!  There have been indeed, instances in which information om the spreadsheet is deemed inaccurate, this might be because of something I overlook, which is why I always include in my posts that people look out for mistakes here and there for me to fix.  Sometimes some weapons have updated versions of themselves, namely the queens wrath weapons, which makes some of them end up with skewered stats like aim assist.  The health values, has indeed, for a very long time been only rough estimates from the planet destiny, which was at the time the most accurate documentation of health values at the time.  I tend to stay away from a lot of the big youtubers, as some of them have repeatedly released false information (no datto reactive reload bonus is not 25% its 33%).  I will update the spreadsheet with updated health values when better documentation and proof.  Luckily though, because of the heavy speculation the results of values gathered from non conventional means are still very accurate and might only be a couple numbers of at times (last word rpm was 219, was later shown to be 225 rpm) so no matter what you might see from the spreadsheet, it's more or likely the absolute most accurate answer you can find on the internet.   I will also be sure to make that list of sources used as well.  Lots of stuff are being worked on, but with me being naturally lazy the time in which these tasks will be completed vary.   Also so many numbers, though I have been wanting to get some completely accurate health values for quite some time.   And I'm a he."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,MythicIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! It came to my attention that the linked article was actually posted on reddit as well by /u/CaptainChaozZz. The post is here. I believe it has all the same content as the article I posted.  I love the spreadsheet that you've made. It's so very very useful!
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,MythicIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is... the PlanetDestiny video is pure in-game footage with, while uncertain, concrete numbers. He shoots twice with the hand cannon then uses the 1's and 2's that the shotgun does in order to come to the range of numbers /u/MythicIV has listed. Here is the link.  So it leaves us with something that doesn't make any sense: If shoulder charge does 200 damage, does that mean it's the upper cap for all classes? It is possible PlanetDestiny hadn't tested thoroughly enough - shotguns fire 6 pellets at once so it's possible the 202 and 203 numbers are overkill by 2 and 3. Further testing is needed, period.  While I'm at it:   As for another complaint, why does Hawkmoon do almost as much damage as a Timur's Lash or Ill Will even though they have a significant impact difference   There's an upper cap on all weapons in PvP, exluding things like LiTC and Final Round. Timur's Lash just hits that cap, hence why it's a huge different in Impact and a small difference in damage."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,mostlyforlurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article I linked at all? I have a feeling you didn't. I agree that 202 and 203 are too high. and that 200 is the upper cap since every class dies by a shoulder charge (excluding warlocks with the ram). Do you have any evidence or support for this upper cap? I have never heard of it and would love to read/watch about it, since I'm definitely interested."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,mostlyforlurking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:58 2015 UTC,"I read it, but when you (or rather, the author) brings in the fact of uncertainty of the numbers that appear and the actual damage on the target, how can you be sure it's exactly 200? If Atheon's Epilogue has been altered from the 2.5% damage patches, how can we be sure other weapon types do exactly rounded damage?  I'm not saying it's not 200. I'm just saying without an exact line saying ""The very highest armor+health you can achieve gives you exactly 200 damage until you die"" or some such it can't be proven. Saying ""base"" in the article doesn't mean it's the highest or lowest possible. Base, in this sense, could easily mean the median value.  Sadly, the Timur's Lash thing was on Reddit long before TDB was even released and lost to time (or rather, lost within Reddit because the search function is impossible to use). I know it came up because someone wanted to be able to 2-shot constantly with the Timur's Lash with Crowd Control and found that even though it would do enough damage mathematically, it doesn't actually kill in-game.  As a sidenote, try not to come off as such as dick when replying. Your interpretation of evidence and data doesn't mean it's correct - solely because there are no straight answers from the people who made the game (yet)."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,doobopbop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:16 2015 UTC,"First, there is no mean intention, and I apologize if I'm coming off as a dick. I'm only trying to discuss the topic. I am not sure what you mean by ""how can we be sure other weapon types do exactly rounded damage?"" If I am interpreting that correctly, my response would be that the author is in fact saying that there is no way to know if each display number is that actual damage value or not. It is safer to assume that it is not the exact value. As an example, he does a test where two different weapon combinations both do 197 damage. In one case, he died, in the other, he lived. In any case, we know shoulder charge does 199.5 to 200.49, so the maximum health+shield of a titan cannot exceed that value.   He also shows that the base health is the same (roughly 105) and that shield corresponds to the armor stat. The amount of armor/recovery/agility varies exactly the same for all three classes. Some classes can just invest more in one of those values than others.  I actually have a Timur's lash with crowd control. It does 95 a head shot, and 109 when crowd control is active. It two shots every single time with crowd control. It doesn't even need two 109's to hit, it only need one. It also two shots enemies with two 95 head shots if they have low enough armor.  I wouldn't say I'm interpreting evidence. The evidence is there, it's math. As long as you take the author's tests as real and not fabricated. I'm not saying it's absolutely correct, I'm only saying it's as close as anyone has gotten. Compared to DattoDoesDestiny's test and PlanetDestiny's test, it does what they do and then some."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,MythicIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"This is completely incorrect. Tripmine does 3 (initial hit damage) + 194 (grenade damage) + 79 (stuck bonus damage).

CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,Promethium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:01:28 2015 UTC,"Sweet dude! Did you test a shoulder charge which says is also 200 damage? The difference is one could be slightly lower than the Titan's HP and the other slightly higher. With each damage tick, you have a possibility to introduce more error since those numbers are most likely not exact, but rounded."
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,Promethium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:16:44 2015 UTC,I didn't do in-depth testing as my friend was going off and I didn't have a full arsenal of weapons ready to go but I plan to at some point soon  I'll test trying to reach 200 damage with as little shots fired as possible to reduce the effects of rounding
CruciblePlaybook,3e10zt,MythicIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:21:11 2015 UTC,"Okay for sure. This was also the point of me posting the article. The person that did the testing had the same thing in mind. You could even try to reproduce it to verify, haha."

Getting damaged by a tripmine that is not stuck to you will do a maximum damage of 194. So Any class can survive a tripmine that is not stuck to them."

By extending the length of the Right Analog Stick it makes it easier to aim more precisely while playing at higher sensitivities because you gain more range of motion. It will take getting use to though.    As for a controller, please do not buy an EvilController. I'd buy a Scuf controller with 2 paddles (Y and X, but they can be remapped with a tool) and switch my button layout to bumper jumper."
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,incubusor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:25 2015 UTC,"This, you can get Kontrol Freeks to avoid spending a lot of money on a new controller while still fixing your problem and possibly getting better accuracy."
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,tgiese13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"I had the opposite experience with the longest Scuf stick. It made things twitchier because the greater moment arm reduces the force required to move the stick. It does smooth out motions that combine x and y axis and once I get used to the sticks I think it will be an advantage. Get control freeks of different lengths and see what you like, then get a scuf if you want paddles."
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,tollarja,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:41 2015 UTC,Kontrol Freaks are a must have for any FPS in my opinion.
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,NLRoss,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:59 2015 UTC,Evil Controllers are 100% garbage. Bought one for my bro's bday on 360 it crapped out after a month. After 2 days the battery pack broke.  100% crap product meant just to make pretty controllers  If you wanna spend up get a scuff for the remapple paddles. I use kontrol freeks on an xb1 controller that i use for both Xb1 AND ps4. I prefer the shorter one's because i have short fingers.
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,rsdon,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:32 2015 UTC,This happened to three controllers I played with in the first six months of playing ps4. The first few batches had a slightly different rubber coating. I put some xbone sticks in the ds4 and that was great. No rubber coating to peel off and the knurl pattern is very grippy (only problem is that it will wear down over time). Gf got me a red ds4 and I decided to go the kontrol freek route. I would recommend the gamer pack X if you want to try some out. Scooped a couple but those are the ones that felt the best to me.
CruciblePlaybook,3e2wau,PeenScreeker_psn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"I have Kontrol Freek Elites and can't imagine going back, aside from the advantage the height gives you the rubber is so grippy and tactile in comparison it really is night and day.  I have recently also gotten a Scuf and I'm in the process of really getting the control scheme ingrained. I use bumper jumper and have used the PS4 remapping to make the paddles O and square, which means the only time my thumb leaves the stick is to swap weapons, which I can live with. I've really enjoyed it so far, and if the cost of it isn't prohibitive then I'd go for one.  That said, these sticks and modded pads will not make you a better player by themselves. My K/D has gotten better and better, but that's because I've been actually taking crucible more seriously and practicing. The sticks and modded controllers simply make it easier to grow in certain respects and allow you do things you couldn't without playing claw (getting a double kill while reviving in skirmish has been my favourite so far) but they will not jump your K/D 0.5 by themselves.  I would definitely recommend Kontrol Freeks to start with, though the size of your hands should inform whether you go for long ones or CQC ones."

I've personally used them for several years. They help with aiming.  If you have the money to spare, buy a scuf controller. I've also been a user of scuf for a few years and it absolutely helps. I recently just bought a new scuf controller because my other scuf was worn out from all the use and abuse.  Scuf paired with Kontrol Freek is the ultimate controller setup in my opinion."
