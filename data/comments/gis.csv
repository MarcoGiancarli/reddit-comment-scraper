Just running GIS tools without any background knowledge could leave you with results that seem like they have merit on the surface, but are in fact meaningless.  If you want to do analysis and you don't have a lot of knowledge, try to stick to very basic analysis that relies on facts. Stuff like this is how many animals, this is how much ground they covered in a month, etc  Remember, if you do something fancy you want to use tools to answer research questions, you don't want to develop research questions based on the results of tools that you don't fully understand.  Professionally, you should focus research questions based on the goals of your organization. If you work for a non profit that is interested in maintaining and increasing orangutan populations, your GIS info could be a great jumping off point. Maybe you can find where they are and the areas that they cover and then go in to the field and inventory their habitat. Then you could get an idea of what kind of habitat they prefer and develop management practices to maintain or enhance their habitay"

gis,3e5g8b,Bbrhuft,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"QGIS has a plugin called GPS tools that uses libraries from the GPS Babel project to connect and download GPS tracks from all common GPS units. So that's not a problem. It even allows live GPS tracking via a COM connection, if you have QGIS Android or QGIS on a Windows tablet.   I think the plugin is installed as standard, if not go to Plugins - Manage and check the box GPS Tools.   This guide has to instructions on how to connect a Garmin 60CS to QGIS, it includes advice on how to circumvent a small bug, but it's probably now fixed by now.  https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_gps/plugins_gps.html  Once you've loaded data into QGIS, you next need to save it in Shapefile format. Only then can you both view and edit the attribute table, which might contain notes on waypoints.   QGIS also has live Heatmaps and many of the same spatial algorithms as ArcMap via the Processing toolbox, provided by Grass and SAGA GIS. There's is however a bug in Processing at the moment that broke the Grass plugin, but it should be fixed any day now. That said, I often end up using GRASS outside of QGIS anyway."

(It may say that the projection already exists).  After you've set the projection to WGS 84, then re-project them to the final projection you are going for.  Its a few more steps but its worked for me and it can be modeled if this is a workflow you use often."

What you're doing with that tool is creating two things: A layer that preserves visualization settings from the KML/KMZ and a GDB containing the actual Esri-compatible feature class.  That's why /u/JingJang's suggestion works: it's simply exporting from the gdb to a stand-alone shapefile.  The GDB you created with the KML to Layer tool should be located in the same place as the output layer file.  Navigate to it in catalog and you can interact with it just like you would any other GDB feature class."

What did you accomplish by putting up posters? etc.    No one cares if you did busy work. Show that your work was useful somehow.

What kinda pay should I expect from a GIS job?   My experience is in the southeast U.S.  Beginner GIS jobs pay about $35k.   ""Technicians.""  This job classification involves repetitive tasks for low pay.  Above that, you 'graduate' to Analyst or Specialist,   which covers a pretty broad range.  Some ""Analyst"" positions have much higher expectations than others,  but your typical early-career Analyst can expect like $40k - 60k.   At this point, people tend to get sorted by technology skills.  People without solid tech skills may get stuck in that ""analyst"" role for extended periods of time, or get promoted to a ""lower level manager"" position in a small organization. (which will get you about $50k-$80k.) However, if you're good (which is highly dependent on your technology skills) and experienced, you can probably find some kind of ""Developer"" or ""Programmer Analyst"" or ""DB Administrator"" type role which make $70k - $100k / year, roughly.  If you're good and experienced AND you're a manager,  e.g. a project manager/GIO, I'm not sure where the ceiling is.  I would say you could make $100k-$150k, but at that level most people's compensation is private. Those jobs are rare, of course, and require a great deal of experience.

The con of ArcGIS Server is the licensing cost. You probably have the money since you are nationally sized business... right? If not you can work a developer license to test it out.  You will want to move your data to postgres(postgis), MS SQL, or Oracle Spatial. I'm 90% certain AGS doesn't support MySQL. MySQL is the worst database for spatial data... MS SQL used to suck, but it doesn't suck as much anymore. I highly recommend Postgres for your data store. It gives you the option of rolling a FOSS4G stack in the future.

gis,3dk2ge,xemoka,3,Fri Jul 17 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"The good parts of ArcServer are the integrated publishing, styling and serving. When setup, a naive user can publish their current map from a desktop client to a server while copying data to a managed ArcSDE Database. Open source solutions are not nearly as smooth as this.  Then they can use the web interface of ArcGIS Online / portal to add their data to a map and publish it in a template. Unfortunately, this step requires AGO or portal as well... and it's a little restricted... and ArcServer may not be as useful as it once was in this workflow, as AGO can now host data for you as well—saving you the ArcServer cost, however limiting you a bit [1]. I really wish when it was originally built that this component was integrated directly into ArcServer, and not a hosted SaaS.   The downsides are inflexibility and developer unfriendliness. It's very much a black box in my opinion. Even their JavaScript client libraries (which you don't have to use now, as there is a plugin for Leaflet that can load layers from ArcServer) are not open source—or even source accessible to those who have licenses. The library provides preset and styled widgets or almost ""bare metal"" access—laking the steps in between to make things quick for a developer (or plumber) [2].   It's also a bit of a resource pig, and I feel as though I don't have many options to configure that aspect of the software. For example, by default, new map services are set to have 1 instance always running [3]. Depending on the machine this can become debilitating after a number of services are running—our machine hit 38 active instances this way (we have a number of students using it) and ArcServer ground to a halt (32Gb ram, quad 2.2ghz cpu vm). I had to forcefully close ArcServer and rebuilt the services directory by hand, as the manager interface would not respond even on ArcServer restart.   [1] However, that may not be the case based on how you're using it. If you're just getting data online and providing it to an end client for review, it's probably more than enough.   [2] An example is icon rendering. If you want to render the same symbol outside of the map for a feature layer (for example, in a custom legend or TOC) you are forced to grab the information directly from ArcServer and create the icon yourself—there's no quick way to generate a symbol from a .getLayer request... or at least none that I've found that's easy. I'd like a map.getLayer(layer).symbol() please.   [3] This can be changed by the user, but as an administrator I can't set a default. This is sane for something that will be accessed lightly, regularly, but for something that might get used once a month it's probably worth the extra time to spin an instance up on demand. This is also in an educational institution's environment—so we have students using these machines, perhaps without knowing exactly what's happening."

Therefore, i think if you use time and resources to train those 25 people without the opportunity (both license- and projectwise) to use those newly acquired skills, it is both a waste of money and time. While two people with GIS knowledge for a 50 people company is not too much (been there, done that), i think the ressources are way better spent to train a team of maybe 5 core GIS analysts, who then should inform the staff about the possibilities the comapny now has with the new GIS knowledge.

Granted, it doesn't have all the functionality of ArcMap, but for a lot of people it is really useful - and it is an extension of the ArcGIS platform. That means if you train up a handful of people on ArcMap - and the rest in Esri Maps for Office - they can all share their work with each other and collaborate via the ArcGIS platform. Maps for Office can geocode data, let you symbolize the data by attributes, create heat maps (kernel density surfaces), find statistical hot and cold spots in your data, view infographics that describe the area around your features, and append a huge number of demographic, spending, and land use variables (to name a few!) to your data.

You probably won't learn a full workflow from a presentation.  I find they are more useful to let you know what is out there for you to explore. Some of the 'cutting-edge' presentations fill up fast.  I tried to go to a Hadoop presentation last year and they weren't letting anyone else in the room ~15 minutes prior to the presentation.  That doesn't happen for most presentations though. Find a day with an interesting meet up that night.  It is a good way to network and talk with people. Along with business cards, consider bringing some up to date copies of your resume in case there is interest."

gis,3digci,Sundance12,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"I would think it is considered too basic, because if you're going to collecting GPS data as a professional, you would probably be using a unit that can have software installed on it like ArcPad or Pathfinder office (there are more, I'm just familiar with Trimble products). You also probably don't get anything in the way of being able to select projection, seeing your DOPs, or anything like that.      On the other hand, GPS that are comparable to what professionals use are expensive. I am looking through Trimble's online store, a basic Juno 3B is $799.99. Looking through the Leica store I can't find anything comparable to the Juno.   Are you sure there is no GPS borrowing policy in your program? Or does your program have an ArcGIS Online organizational account they could possibly add you to to practice with ArcGIS Collector? Or if you do consider getting a Juno, see if your program has licenses of ArcPad you can use.    Edit: If you have a laptop and ArcGIS or QGIS, you could go with something like this Globalsat 353-S4. In ArcGIS you can collect GPS data and see all the pertinent information collectors need to consider such as DOPs, Projection, and data management. QGIS may have something similar, I've seen a GPS toolbar in the program, but I am not sure."

SAR data is freely available through the ESA Sentinel-1 program. The constellation has a high temporal resolution due to frequent revisit times, between 1-3 days dependant on latitude. Spatial resolution is dependant on the multilook method used to reduce phase noise, but generally in the default data capture mode of the Sentinel-1 satellites, the resolution is 20 * 22m (range * azimuth).

Lidar vertical accuracy is measured this way; there are dozens to hundreds of very accurate (RTK DGPS) control points collected over the survey area.   These measurements are treated as a population of observations for calculation of summary statistics. Parametric calculations are used, which means that the population is assumed to be normally distributed (bell-curve shaped histogram).  The RMSE (in excel: =SQRT(SUMSQ(differences)/COUNTA(differences)) of the differences between the GPS measurements and the lidar measurements represents 1 sigma or about 68% of the population. Multiplying this by 1.96 gives the difference for 2 sigma or about 95% of the population of observations. This is the standard error reporting level.  If you create dozens of very accurate GPS readings twice, and they are repeated in the same locations, then you can find the differences between them and calculate summary statistics, and then get a cup of coffee and ask for a raise."

gis,3deejv,bmoregeo,2,Wed Jul 15 22:27:15 2015 UTC,FYI: The ArcGIS javascript api will not be able to handle all of those points as a Feature Service. You will also struggle serving that out as a feature service.  You will probably have to use a Map Service which will limit your dynamic clicking around abilities.
gis,3deejv,cmartin616,2,Wed Jul 15 23:17:09 2015 UTC,"I thought you said your data was not spatial.  Why would you serve this up with ArcGIS Server?  It just adds a layer of complexity that is unneeded.  I think this would be handled better querying the server directly and leveraging something like D3 to stylize the results.  However, if your data is spatial and I'm misunderstanding your question:  In addition to /u/bmoregeo, I'd suggest increasing the number of features returned on the service as well as setting a tight scale dependency if you need all 300,000.   How spatially distributed is your data?  Could you get away with a scale dependency that would limit to ~3-5,000 features?  It would still be kind of slow to render/pan."
gis,3deejv,bmoregeo,3,Thu Jul 16 12:56:55 2015 UTC,If the data isn't spatial... why use arcgis server? Does it join to some sort of spatial component?  If the data is non-spatial then it is a non-sde/ags problem for storage. I would keep the data as standalone oracle tables.  How many records/request are you looking to query out of the rest api? They initially limit you to 1000.  You can expand that as necessary... but you then start to get into a lot of networking stuff.
gis,3deejv,based2,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:29 2015 UTC,That is a great point. Because it is non-spatial I could always just use a GP service to grab the data directly from the oracle table.

It's a tough problem with no perfect solution.  Using strictly visible imagery (~400 - 800 nm) there will always be extensive errors. Your best bet is a combination of near-IR (MODIS band 26, ~1375 nm) and longer IR bands. Visible and near-IR algorithms will only work during the daylit austral summer months, of course.  There are MODIS products available that already do this kind of cloud discrimination, e.g. MOD35_L2. In polar regions the results are so-so, at best.  Good luck."

I don't really care about vectorizing the features or text so much as getting a georeferenced raster.  Most of the maps are from the last 50 years or so, so with a sufficiently robust algorithm I think a couple extra intersections shouldn't affect things.  My current train of thought is along the lines of this paper1:    Detect intersections of roads in scanned map Calculate intersections of roads from TIGER/Line data (the easiest part!) Use a point matching algorithm that can tolerate spurious points (e.g., RANSAC) to find a set of points from 1 and 2 that match, which can be used to georeference the raster.   1: (From my research it seems that this technology was commercialized by the authors as Geosemble Technologies which was acquired by (TerraGo)[http://www.terragotech.com/].

gis,3d9fca,R0b0d0nut,3,Tue Jul 14 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Domains are available values for a field. They are sort of like a pick list. It makes your data more normalized by reducing what editors can add.  Subtypes define different classifications for the table. It allows you to define default values for different subtypes and you can also assign different domains to fields. It is a way of keeping a single table schema for similar, but not entirely the same data. I tend to use this for points of interest.  Example: You could create a poi feature class with a subtype on POI Type. You then can assign different domains to fields for each subtype.  Field: POIClass  Subtype| Domain  Church| ChurchClassDomain  Restaurant| RestaurantClassDomain  Etc| EtcClassDomain  You can also assign default values for each of these subtypes.  Subtype| Default Value  Church| Lutheran  Restaurant| Fast Food  Etc| Pineapple!  It can be a very powerful concept once you understand how to model your data."

gis,3d75js,pewpew_pewpew_pew,27,Tue Jul 14 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"Part 1: You need a Portfolio  One thing you can do to help make up for a weak resume is have a strong portfolio. Put code up on GitHub, find a place to put web maps, or curate a nice collection of screenshots or PDFs for desktop oriented GIS.   If you don't have a portfolio, you need to start putting one together stat. Reach back to your school projects if you still have them, and then start doing new projects. Do a project a week or something like that until your resume starts to look good.     Part 2a: Relevant Qualifications  Start with Relevant Qualifications (and spell Relevent correctly) and beef it up.    Don't make me guess ANYTHING. State exactly which software you're talking about and how good you are at it.    Which ""leading geospatial software"" are you talking about? Which parts of MS Office -- Access? PowerPoint? Excel?   How good are you at Excel? Expert (you write your own macros and love pivot tables)? Noob (can open and save files)?    Qualify any vague terms   When you say you can strategize and prioritize, how did you do that? Just off the cuff? Gantt charts? Find something solid for the hiring person to latch on to.   Dig deep and find more.    Find more qualifications. You got a degree in Geography with a concentration in GIS, you must have some experience with ArcGIS, cartography, statistics, projections, databases, etc. All of that needs to be in your qualifications section if there's a chance that it's at all related to the job you're applying for.   Here's a screenshot of the qualifications section of the resume I used to get my first GIS job. This was after the semester of my GIS Masters program:   The stuff in red is stuff that I never used on the job, but it's stuff that's tangentially related to the job description I was applying for, which proved that I had experience of some sort.   Part 2b: Employment  This also needs to be beefier. Use action words and list achievements and add details. If you don't list some easy to understand achievement, tell a story that will make an interviewer ask questions.   Eg.    ""Improved office efficiency by managing personnel meeting schedules"" ""Vectorized 20,000 km of natural gas pipeline from hand drawn scanned plat books""  ""Managed data upload process to custom database using XYZ software (again, name names!)""     Part 3: The Job Application Strategy  When applying for a job, pray that you're not using one of those online resume building forms. If you are, then you have to use what they give you, but for any other job, you've actually got a 6-part application to optimize.   Here's what the person getting your job application is going to see (possibly in this order):    The email/letter   When you send your resume, you're going to send a nicely formatted PDF as an email attachment. You're going to include a short note in the email text.  This is so that they don't have to read your whole resume immediately and so they can find the right email easily later. The note is going to say something like this:   I'm pewpew_pewpew_pew, I'm applying for the $POSITIOIN. Enclosed is my cover letter and resume. I'm excited about this job because $REASON_ONE and $REASON_TWO. I can be reached at (123)-123-1234 or pewpew_pewpew_pew@gmail.com. I look forward to speaking with you soon.    Cover letter   In your email you're going to attach exactly ONE attachment, a PDF. It's going to have your name in the filename. Eg. (pewpew_pew_Resume.pdf).   This is what the hiring person is going to read later when they print off the stack of resumes and cover letters. Page one of this PDF is going to be an AWESOME cover letter. In 2-3 paragraphs It's going to make the hiring person like you and hope that you're qualified. It's going to tell them that you are excited to work for them, and how awesome you are.    Resume   Your resume is going to be 1 solid page. It's going to be full of great details, but not overflowing. It's going to be formatted nicely, everything will be spelled correctly and it's going to tell them that yes you are qualified.    References   If you have a really solid lead inside the company, then they're going to personally hand in your resume.   if you have a loose contact or associate inside the company or a 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn, you're going to ask your associate if you can mention that you know them when you apply. You may mention this in your cover letter, or you may add a References section to your resume.   In any case your references section should at least say ""References available upon request"" and you should have at least 2-3 people who can vouch for you. Professional references are much better than character references, and could even include people you did projects with in school if needed. Use character references only if you really need to.   Portfolio   Your portfolio may be a list of webmap links, a couple pages of screenshots of desktop maps or model builder routines you've made, or something else. Depending on what you have, this may be combined with Web Links below.    Web Links   Include a link to your personal website, LinkedIn, GitHub or other online accounts which will give a good impression of you to the hiring manager. You want to make it easy for them to spend more time on your application than on anyone else's and you want it to be positive."

Openlayers is generally meant as a reference for setting up your map, I've never used it as a final product. What are you trying to do?  Do you need satellite imagery? Or a street map?

This video is a milestone for me because I am now able to use an external image that affects the probability of ignition for any given cell based on the area around it.  In this example, when processing a focal cell, burning neighbouring cells at lower elevations will contribute more to the probability of the focal cell igniting, and burning cells at higher elevations will contribute less to the probability of the focal cell igniting.  The magnitude of this probability modification can be tweaked by the user.  Currently I am working on ways to make these sorts of ""external modifiers"" more open-ended so that the user can build their own custom models based on whatever parameter they want, so long as they have the relevant data."

So having knowledge about database management/development could be useful.  Knowing the ins and outs of various database platforms (SQL, Oracle, PostGIS, ESRI file/personal geodatabase), knowing something about versioning and multi-user editing, etc could all by seen as a strength.  From the analytical side knowing how perform complex spatial and 3D analysis beyond the typical join a few census tables together and make a map.  Be able to show some good examples.  I work with a lot of engineers, so familiarity with CAD and translating data to/from CAD would be seen as a strength.

GIS for Hotel Management, is completely different than GIS for Emergency Management.  So, a knowledge of not just the domain, but of the methodology for analysis is necessary.  To mitigate this, you must have a consultant, or staff member that has an in-depth knowledge of both your domain, and GIS. Thats more than just some 12 tutorial manual, but to have a functional knowledge of both your domain and Spatial.

gis,3cygp1,countpupula,2,Sun Jul 12 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"GIS for Hotel Management, is completely different than GIS for Emergency Management.   It really isn't, though.  The core principles, workflows, and general methodology are the same pan-industry.  There are nuances way, way down in the weeds, but the huge majority of people won't ever see that.  I think that the author is, as another poster already pointed out, making that statement based on high-level analysts/specialists that make up that 0.5% and live way, way down in the weeds.  To them there would be a substantial difference.  But for general analytics, data management, etc., if you're doing it right it's pretty much the same idea.  By your own admission, you're not in that 0.5%, so that argument won't sell you.  I tell this to people trying to figure out educational tracks in GIS:  I can train a reasonably intelligent person with basic computer skills to do tech-level work in about two weeks, with another month or so for them to be working entirely independently.  So, in six weeks I've equaled or eclipsed a pretty substantial cross-section of people currently employed in the industry.  I'd rather train a fresh person than have somebody with a bunch of set ideas and bad habits and no other real skill.  The value comes in people with a really solid understanding of server management and, more importantly, coding.  Somebody arriving at my door with their resume with a bunch of db and coding skills and no GIS experience is going to get hired every time over the person with no coding/db experience and a ton of GIS tech work.  I can fairly easily give you the skills necessary to run the GIS software.  Understanding what's going on in the background and being able to build on that is a different animal, and that's where the value lies."
gis,3cygp1,socioevo,3,Mon Jul 13 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"Of course you can bring other strengths to the table - you would know your other strengths better than we would.  Coding gives you an edge, though, if you are looking for a job in GIS - and many, many people today know how to code, so they will have an edge over you if you don't learn.   Similarly, GIS gives you an edge in several ""non-GIS"" jobs - lots of policy shops or planning firms would view GIS as a strength, but they wouldn't necessarily be hiring you for a GIS job per se. So if you think maps are cool but are truly opposed to learning skillsets like coding, maybe you should consider GIS as a way to enhance your resume in another, related field."

If you are in GIS specific program that doesn't require you to take some kind of programming class then I would question the legitimacy of the program.   If you are in a Geography program and want to get a job that uses GIS, other strengths to have would be Remote Sensing and Statistics. Those are skills that can be applied to many fields.

The way my department works, we have a mix of GIS programmers and analysts. I'm an analyst, so when we get a problem to solve, we come up with the how, like conceptualize, design all the steps, and our programmers collaborate to do the automating and scripting. Since my background is in graduate level GIS they want someone like me coming up with a way to analyze the problem, and our programmers are there to expedite the process.

What have you investigated? What about GIS interests you? What sorts of projects do you want to work on?  Most people are attracted to GIS because they like solving problems. ArcGIS is a language just like JavaScript or Python, but it's a language of analysis terms and toolboxes. These are just tools we use to solve problems. ""Learning to code"" doesn't mean becoming a programming expert -- it just means knowing enough to solve the problem at hand. Sometimes a desktop GIS is the best tool, but not every problem is a nail that can be hit with a single hammer.  I'm typing this on my phone, so it's not the most eloquent thing in the world, but the point is -- new tools are awesome and can be super powerful! When you have to put a bunch of screws in the wall, an electric drill is way handier than a screwdriver. More tools are better than fewer. And programming can be quite fun, too! :)"

I've found in my couple of years on /r/gis that the people here kind and willing to help out, especially when you treat them with respect. You may be a perfectly pleasant person in real life, but the way in which you've interacted with people here discourages productive engagement.

I am only a beginner who has been learning for a little less than 4 months, but I can say just based off of the little I've gained within that time that I think you should try to incorporate as much Python as you can into your projects if you have any extra time to kill at your job.

In addition to the general fun of making maps, my interest in GIS is in how it helps to answer a question or deepen understanding of some issue in the real world, which then will ideally point towards a solution.

Entry level, for example, you are very likely to get placed dropping structure points, looking for parcel fabric errors, georeferencing old maps, etc. shit like that. You could have to look through  Yes, you may do analysis now, but whatever organization you first work at will not care about your analysis skills. If you bring in a portfolio of projects you've worked on (it's way cooler if you have a website with everything online, btw) they will tell you that's interesting and that they enjoyed looking at it. It's probably true, they did think that it was interesting but they aren't interested in whatever analysis skills you've only begun to develop. The organization already has analysis skills in place and if they're going to change them, it's about a million meetings with tons of people who all have more experience than you.  One task that I've seen is to population a disaster risk database using HAZUS (google it if you don't know what it is). Your analysis skills from university did not teach you how to correctly populate that database using the results from HAZUS outputs (many of which are done manually but many are also done by code).  I guess my point is, whatever analysis skills you learned in school aren't really that useful in practice in the real world. Being open to analysis is a great skill but what you've done ArcMap is barely a blip on the radar to what kind of analysis is done once you leave school. You shouldn't be so closed minded to learning to code. In just a couple of years being out of university, it's been nothing but examples of how coding is definitely the way to go rather than relying on tool functions.   Speaking of tool functions, many organizations use tools that internal people created and not all of the tools exist yet, either. Organizations always want new tools (provided they actually make something easier)."

Some of that is technical skills (doing the work) and some of that is personal skills (working with coworkers, clients, etc).    For a GIS professional, being able to code is a nice tool to have in the toolbox.  Is it required in all cases?  No it's not.  But by not knowing how to code, you close a lot of doors for yourself.   I think the biggest part of being a GIS professional is knowing how to solve problems and if you don't know how, being able to research and find a solution.  If you are stuck using out of the box solutions (software, tools, platforms, etc.), you limit your ability to provide solutions to complex problems.  At the end of the day, if you don't like coding and know you will never be proficient at it, then don't bother, but understand that by doing so, your employment/advancement prospects in the future could be affected by your choice."

gis,3cygp1,DataMechanic,4,Sun Jul 12 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"Learning to code as you are presented with problems is one way of doing it.  I started off as a GIS analyst 10 years ago having no coding skills at all.  I've self taught myself Python and C# (Arc Objects application coding) and I'm currently learning more of the web based coding languages(HTML/CSS/Javascript) and APIs (ESRI Javascript/Leaflet).  I learned by presenting myself with small coding tasks that made my GIS life easier and build up my knowledge from there.  Some of the more recent tools I've developed are pretty powerful and are used by internal staff within my company and are a real time saver.  I've also been able to automate complex modeling tasks that would've been difficult or impossible to do without coding.  To think that you could just ""learn enough to code"" some complex task with no prior knowledge is a bit naive.  It would be like trying to solve advanced calculus problems while only having knowledge of basic algebra.  Can you fumble your way through?  Maybe, but it's a heck of a chore.    Learning to code is all about building up a mental library.  There are so many little building blocks you need to become familiar with that having to learn it all at once to complete one task would be quite tedious."
gis,3cygp1,DataMechanic,-3,Sun Jul 12 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I didn't say that complex tasks should be approached like that.  But should they be handled by GIS analysts who self-taught code on the side?  It can't be both a special and important skill and a skill anyone can and should be able to teach themselves.  I find it really interesting that so far no one has come up with any ideas on other strengths in GIS, or accounted for the many GIS users who don't code."
gis,3cygp1,666f6f626172,4,Sun Jul 12 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"The whole point is that coding is a skill that anyone can learn.  Will you be an expert?  Probably not, but even a basic knowledge can help your day to day workflow and set you apart.    You are in school right now you say.  Why are you actively looking for things NOT to learn?  That makes no sense.  Are there a lot of GIS people out there that don't code?  Sure there are.  The difference between them and you is they already have a job and you will be looking for one.  The broader you can make your skillset, the better your odds will be.  And even if you do get a job, if you want to move past entry level, you will need the skillset to do so.  The skillset you need depends on what kind of job you are looking for.  You still haven't specifically mentioned what types of jobs you might apply for, so everyone has to be pretty generic in their replies.  For most GIS jobs these days, coding is either required or looks good on the resume.    For that matter, what do you plan to learn instead of coding?  What, in your mind, do you think is a more valuable use of your educational time?"

It can't be both a special and important skill and a skill anyone can and should be able to teach themselves.   If you are familiar enough with the geospatial tools it takes little time and minimal arcpy/Python knowledge to be able to Google search a script or chunk of code and massage it to your needs. The thing is with arcpy, and really any sort of script writing, if it's wrong it won't work. The worst thing you can really do is erase something, which you should be working from a copy anyway. As an Analyst, you are still executing each step you normally do in arcmap (for the most part). With arcpy you are just doing it in written form. The ""quality"" of work doesn't change based on your ""coding"" ability - it's either right or it's wrong. And inefficiencies in your script really don't make much of a difference as long as your machine can handle it.  I think the fact that Google posts GIS, and the DoD posts ""programming"", job ads that sometimes only require a high school diploma or associates degree says a lot about what major employers think can be handled by a self-taught coder. Sometimes that's exactly what they are looking for in a coder; the guy who has only left his basement to take a dump and go down the street to get TacoBell - because that's the guy who's been picking out x86 assembly exploits for over a decade. Depending on the role that's being filled, I can almost guarantee that a candidate who's been applying GIS in the ""real world"" for 10+ years and self-taught gisscripting is going to be just as competitive, if not more, than the guy who's just finished his grad school internship.   Many ""trained"" coders teach themselves languages other than the couple that their school's Comp Sci program required. Hell, if you have an intermediate level of C knowledge it takes very little effort to be able to work with MANY other languages.   It's just like any foreign language, you don't actually 'get it' just sitting in a class room taking notes while professor talks about the random module, you need to practice it every day and apply it. It's pure memorization and practice.   I think that there is definitely a generational disconnect here because it seems that many pre- millenials cannot even grasp that many people land jobs, some that pay as much as 6 figures, working with a specialized piece of software or code, without any sort of ""official"" credentials."

To just do GIS as a profession, it's becoming more difficult to move ahead without having the requisite technical skills in e.g programming or database administration. GIS without programming is kind of held to the same standards as graphic design - you're not likely to get to the top levels of the pay scale unless you end up managing a large team.  Using GIS as a tool - that's entirely different. Surveyors, civil/environmental engineers, epidemiologists, geologists, etc. use GIS as part of their work without being involved in programming, but that's not the primary focus of their work. Kind of like a lab tech versus a chemist - they may use the same equipment but the chemist has more domain specific knowledge."

I think that in the future, in both GIS and other fields relating to tech, development is shifting towards creating products that allow people to create and develop their own custom stuff.   For example, web hosting sites like weebly and google sites that you build your own custom product from the pieces without touching code. Things like AppStudio for mobile and so forth relating to GIS.  With tech moving increasingly cloud-based, there is less of a need over time to have as many traditional desktop-GIS roles. I am sure it will still exist as it is essential to the field and data integrity, but not everyone in an office needs to be trained on ArcMap to use the power of basic spatial analysis and GIS. Quickly constructed and tailored applications from a builder to work hand-in-hand with custom components meet the needs of a wide variety of organizations and their users who just need to know ""what is where""."

Then start applying for other aviation jobs and include the maps you've made as examples of a skill you would bring as an employee.  Also play up GIS in your cover letter and resume. An astute hiring manager will recognize the potential of hiring someone with GIS as a skill.  Rather than ending up with a GIS job in aviation, you'll have an aviation job with GIS as a duty.  I'm not familiar enough with the aviation industry to know how likely it is to work, but it's a strategy to consider."

gis,3cxkt2,Chimpville,2,Sun Jul 12 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"I believe OP is from Canada rather than the US. The US Army relies more on reachback capability when it comes to GEO INT, meaning they farm the work out to civilian contractors at their larger infrastructures or even back in the US. Failing that, they do without. The US forces carry a very small GEO INT footprint compared to a lot of their Western counterparts.   Speaking specifically about Canada, they have dedicated GEO INT specialist they call Geomatics Technicians (of course the website is down... way to set an impression my Canuck brethren!). This job used to be, like most technical trades in the Canadian forces, only available to those who'd served a minimum period in the combat arms. Back in 2009 they were starting to get through guys who'd been recruited directly from the civilian world as they recognised it as a growth industry and couldn't rely on a steady enough stream of crusty but technically adept veterans any more.  This whole post should be caveated with the fact that I am (as is probably already apparent) military GIS and all my experiences are from this point of view. Please bear this in mind, though I will attempt to be objective.   The advantages of Military over Government/Civil Service are fairly substantial and the following list is by no means exhaustive:   More pay (!!) Training. They cover everything from initial collect by remote sensor or ground survey to dissemination whether it be by hard copy or web-services. It's all free and nowadays, all university accredited. Experience. Much more varied, working on everything from kinetic military ops and support to civilian crisis to long-term domestic security and capability development. Clearances. Virtually all military GEO INT are cleared up to their country equivalent of Top Secret and above. This grants not only great working opportunities whilst in, it means you command a higher wage when you get out. Getting the clearance as a government worker is extremely role-dependant, getting it as a commercial contractor is quite hard. Reputation. Every employer is familiar with their military and usually regard them in a good light. This is particularly true of GIS industries since they know you're likely to have travelled, worked in adverse conditions and are used to robust, time-critical working conditions.   The above is obviously tempered by some pretty significant draw-backs as well. Again the following list is by no means exhaustive:   You're in the military. Yes this is just as much of an advantage as a disadvantage, however this one is particularly pointed when being in the miltiary just isn't your thing. You'll hate every minute, fail to get what you want out of it and leave feeling jaded and as though you've wasted your time. Cannot stress enough: nobody should join the military unless they know it's for them. You will hate it, we won't want to work with you... there will be tears. Lack of career autonomy. You will go where they need you, or where is available when it comes to your time to move. You get some say, but ultimately operational circumstances dictate the situation entirely. This will impact your training, experience and career specialisations. External requirements. You'll have a lot of other areas in which you are expected to perform which will be almost entirely unrelated to GIS. This may be fitness, military training/deployments, leadership development or administrative duties. They will take up a lot of your time, sometimes all of it. It can be frustrating, but see above for the section on the military not really being for you.. Experience too broad. You will be a jack of all trades and a mast... well it massively depends on yourself as an individual. You will have the opportunity to pursue higher-education and maintain your skills in certain areas, but skill-fade in others is inevitable. At best you will have to work hard to keep your broad skillset to a high-standard, at worst you will have a functional base-level which can be built on when you eventually need to specialise in an area.   Please take from above what you will; I'm clearly somewhat biased in my views. There's a lot more that could be added, however I'm currently balls-deep in an MSc (paid for), my kids are running around my feet and I've procrastinated on reddit long enough. I would love to hear what other people think about my perspective, particularly if they have contrasting views.  tl;dr  It's great and the opportunities are endless and free or it's shite, hateful, depressing and you'll waste your time. Which of those depends pretty much on you as an individual and whether you are committed, robust and assertive enough to make the most of it.  Edit: Words. Did not proofread. D-"

I would suggest to choose a particular issue related to remote sensing where you have already experience (land use/land cover is very good) and focus on that. Remote sensing is advancing at very fast pace so you need to be always informed about the latest news.  Also, learning python (or any other code) is very useful for your career, at least from my personal experience. Good luck for your career!"

gis,3cx2in,NewCowInTown,2,Sat Jul 11 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"My normal process is mosaic the DEMS that I'm interested in using and then reproject into an equal area projection that has the same coordinates in (x,y,z). I typically use the bilinear or cubic convolution to process the mosaic to reduce potential artifacts. State Plane projections work well for this.   Getting a really good looking hillshade is a bit of an art - and there are many good resources available via google search. If you're using ARCGIS, the Multidirectional Hillshades typically look good out of the box.   Using a projected coordinate system with the same same coordinate structure in the horizontal and vertical directions lets you mess with the Z-factor stretch in a more intuitive way, rather than trying to calculate the factor between coordinate systems that differ in the horizontal and vertical."

You would install PostgreSQL and PostGIS on top of that as an extension. Install Geoserver and register the PostGIS instance as a data store. Load the data into PostGIS and use QGIS to edit the points. The changes will automatically be synced up with Geoserver and delivered to your Leaflet map.

Convert both sets of polygons to line features (be sure to maintain attribute data!) 3) Run an intersect or spatial join between the two output line feature classes 4) The output from this should be a line feature class of all of the borders, allowing you to calculate the border length based on !shape.length! 5) at this point you can join the table from your line features back to the original polygon features with your unique ID fields and divide by the original perimeter of each polygon. (depending on the bordering polygon topology you made need to create a relationship class and use Python cursors to to perform the calcs)   Hope this has been useful!"

Upon a successful response from GeoServer the shape is copied from the Leaflet-Draw layer back to the data layer and is no longer in edit mode.   Creating shapes was basically the same, except they used the Leaflet-Draw tools to initialize a shape.

There are improvements in this being done all over the place, but until this is more common, I don't see the ease of use so to say being such that VR in GIS becomes common.   Take for example even simple web maps, tilting and to make 3d objects in maps can often display the same information less quickly and with good cartography. Simplification can be sometimes the best tool for the job. In general VR and VR interfaces have a LONG way to come.  Finally we still struggle to handle and manage large amounts of data already in GIS, making fluid displays of 3d data is difficult. This often requires much faster processing, and lots more parallelism. Most GIS base libraries are fairly old and have not been built with thread safety in mind. This is slowly changing over time, but it is not an easy task and will take a lot of effort."

The key is often efficient access of data, so the computational cost is usually upfront (i.e. lot of preprocessing time to parse the data into an oct tree or something like that) and many programs also utilize level of detail rendering dependent on view direction (sort of like pyramiding in arc, but with the different levels of the data resolution being displayed depending  on which way the observer is ""looking"")."

Something that we don't have software libraries for yet in GIS or that integrate with GIS (not saying they don't exist or its not possible). Most of the work of GIS is processing, editing of data. This often demands editing of data in the display. It is hard to make data structures that are processed in a GL multi processed environment and editable. In most cases this isn't even possible given the current structure of processors. Mutexes are expensive computationally and video cards have no concept of them.

Now we are in the realm of 3D pipelines and complex 3D pipelines at that. Building pipelines in 3d is complex, displaying them is difficult, add on internal and external corrosion features and you get a very dense dataset.

A .tfw file, which would include the projection info and extent in plaintext, sometimes comes along for the ride but is more of an ESRI-specific file.  When you add the geotiff to QGIS it will read the projection and extent from the .tif file and display your .tif onscreen accordingly.  You can right click on the tif name in that table of contents ""layer"" window on the left, select ""Properties"" and then on the ""General"" tab see the coordinate reference system of your tif.  I believe that if you add another raster image to the window that uses a different coordinate system QGIS will reproject on-the-fly the second file to match the first -- or at least give you some warnings about the differences.  So I'm not sure that you absolutely need to reproject anything.  If you give this a try and I'm wrong please let me know.

And it's also evident because when I enable the overlay in the USGS map explorer, it overlays correctly (as a rectangular image). The image comes in as a square in QGIS, so that got me thinking, maybe geoTIFF is always square, and I need to reproject it to the correct projection (as an aside, in 3DEM, I experimented with a reproject function, and it stretched out and looked much more accurate--I would try to do the same in QGIS but the options there are over my head).   I've looked at the metadata on USGS and it is in fact a geotiff, see this image link for some info I copied from the USGS site  http://i.imgur.com/K7AtYIb.jpg  So, first I need to unsquash this USGS tiff data. And then, I want to match (georeference?) some aerial imagery (or other map imagery) to the exact extents of my unsquashed tiff, to be used in a 3D application as a texture.

gis,3cjr5r,xod1ak,3,Wed Jul 8 15:38:11 2015 UTC,Short answer is yes. They both can basically do the same thing. Do yourself a favor and try to learn both. You can get a fee 60 day ArcGIS trial and can even get the full version for $100 / year. (ArcGIS for Home) A person knowing how to do GIS tasks in both software will have a great advantage over someone who can only use one.    As far as easy to transfer from one to another. I'm not the best to answer that. I'm a long-time user of ArcGIS. Since before it was called ArcGIS. I really struggle and get frustrated with QGIS. It's so counter-intuitive to ArcGIS (for me) that I just stop using it. Even though I know it can do the same thing.
gis,3cjr5r,xod1ak,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I noticed the ArcGIS for Home package. I definitely think it's worth the investment, but I'll have to wait a month or two before I can pay for the first year. In the meantime I feel it would be best to practice with QGIS just to get a feel for GIS software in general. Do you know of any GIS tutorials that just give an overview of what GIS is and what it can do?  I figured the transferability wouldn't be all there, but I'm sure learning both wouldn't be a bad idea."

gis,3cl14o,Chevy_Chaser,5,Sun Jul 12 03:09:17 2015 UTC,"This is solely my opinion and it may be an unpopular one at that.  Development is where GIS is heading (or has already gone).  Here are some of the problems I see with other aspects of GIS:  Mapping:   Anyone can make a map (I've heard them called map monkeys). Employers often want maps very quickly. Cartographers are artists who need to take their time and companies often won't pay for the time. True cartographer positions are probably rare.   Analysis:   Very few companies I've come across leverage true GIS analysis. The companies who do use analysts properly know what to look for, have high expectations and pay accordingly. These positions are highly competitive and require a different skill set (for example - advanced statistics).   Database Admin/IT:   You will be expected, in all likelihood, to have a grasp of these technologies regardless of your position/role. True DBA or IT folks are trained in a separate field.  It would be very difficult to be a proficient GIS, DBA, and IT person without many years experience.  Even that is probably stretching the definition of proficient. True DBAs are probably not going to have their hands in GIS analysis, cartography, etc. Same goes for IT personnel.   So, that leaves development.  Development (to me) has a few flavors:  Python, scripting, automation   Increase productivity Reduce monotony Streamline complex processes   JavaScript, web development   Create custom web applications. Extend functionality for pre-existing applications Create custom functionality/workflows unique to the application   The above two areas are where I feel people can stand out.  These skills are valued (not that the others aren't!) and sought after.  Finding ways to stand out from the crowd is the easiest way to get hired.  - Back to the original question -  Showcase your development skills:    Develop your own portfolio - show you can write HTML/CSS/JS.  Don't use a prebuilt website generator (Wix, SquareSpace, etc.).  WordPress might be okay if you are customizing it and can show you are competent with WordPress.  Show you can leverage modern or more advanced technologies (Bootstrap for responsive design, Sass/Less for CSS, Backbone, Angular, etc.).  Exhibit the ability to learn new technologies (various APIs). Have an active GitHub/BitBucket/whatever account that shows you are interested in creating your own projects, maintaining them, and evolving them.   One of the best ideas ever given to me for my portfolio was to create a map using the Esri JSAPI.  Now recreate the map using Google Maps API.  Now do it again with Leaflet.  It may all be the same map but it shows you could figure out how to implement similar, yet different technologies.  As a potential employer, I can look at your resume as see you don't know how to do X but you know Y and can probably adapt to X."
gis,3cl14o,cmartin616,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:18 2015 UTC,Do you have any tips or links that will help me to learn how to develop a portfolio/ make interactive maps? I'm also kind of confused as to what potential employers are looking for/what a portfolio entails. Is what you're describing having my maps hosted on a website or interactive maps where you click on a region and it displays the data for that region located on my website? Sorry if my post is unclear.
gis,3cl14o,Chevy_Chaser,2,Sun Jul 12 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"I can go into more detail later but here are the basics:  You need a place to put your website.  Do you have hosting?  If not, there are really low-cost or free options.  Hosting (free, basic options):   GitHub Wix SquareSoft   I currently use a combination of DigitalOcean for hosting and GoDaddy for my domain registration.  Digital Ocean lets me stand up virtual machines/servers really quickly as web servers.  It costs $7/mo.  I'm a huge fan.  They have great documentation or tutorials for every question I've had.  Let me know if you are interested in this option as we could both get some credit with recommendations.  Also GoDaddy cost me ~$14 to register my domain name for two years.  Development:   Wix, SquareSoft, etc are drag and drop editors.  No coding is required.  However, this doesn't exhibit any true skills other than maybe design.  The design options are really limited though.  It will allow you to stand up a portfolio quickly and get a prototype put together without fighting with code at the same time. I started by following the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery lines at CodeCademy. Once you have a decent grasp of JavaScript, look into Esri's JS API.  I advocate for this a lot.  I'm not saying it is the best.  I'm just saying it is the most commonly used/implemented JS mapping library.  It is particularly required/preferred by people without technical know-how as the brand sells. You can also look into Leaflet.  It is a really lightweight mapping API that is quick and easy to understand the basics.  It can be limiting at times without some extensibility though.  Extending Leaflet takes some JavaScript understanding beyond the basics. You can always message me with questions directly and I will do my best to answer.  My classmates, Reddit, and StackOverflow taught me how to do these things.  I try to return the favor.    Portfolio:   Everyone has a different approach to their profile.  I'd suggest you Google and look at 5 or 10 of them to get a good idea. I chose to include full contact information, my resume, samples of my work, some awards I received, and a description of my skills. I made (or will make) digital versions of maps that demonstrate my skills.  I included links to download PDFs of the same maps made with ArcMap or QGIS.  I also included a PDF of my resume. It depends on the purpose of your portfolio.  If you like cartography, demonstrate a variety of design elements.  I am interested in development so I tried to show use of a variety of modern technologies.   Hope that helps!"

The only trick is to modify the original DEM with the height based on the land use type. So create a raster that maps landuse classification to a height value then add that to the DEM.  Make sure to check the units on everything. It's easier to use a projected coordinate system and work exclusively in meters.

One thing that helps is when you're cutting it up, make sure the pieces overlap by an inch (3-4 cm) or so, that way you don't have to worry about the edges matching up exactly. I would go through and find the piece that most lines up with existing imagery first, then work your way out from there. Once you georectify the first piece, it's a snap to attach the overlap using features from the first map, then go about attaching new points to the new piece.   The problems with these maps, especially yours with a train route, is that they're more... metaphorical in their representation of the routes. Also, a lot of these old historic maps get more and more distorted the farther you get from the center of the map. But good luck, if you need any more help, let me know."

Reconfigure your data to store the objects in an array for each route. Basically the same as the idea above, just skip the part of using an array of hashes.   Another option would be to look in to using some free data hosting such as https://cartodb.com/ or www.mapbox.com and then you can create your layer groups there and publish a service to access the unique routes containing the visible features you want and then you can use the simple layer control approach.    As far as publishing examples using require, it is a bit more complex and of course depends on your app. However it, usually results in you breaking down the code into a single functioning example that you can post in to something like a jsfiddle.    If you're already using git though, look into utilizing https://pages.github.com/    Hope this helps. Sounds like it'll be a nice lil app to check out. Albany to SD sounds like a helluva drive though ;)"

Lots of surveyors responding to this that all do the same thing.  It's really difficult to find out when you've made a blunder. For example a simple transcription error (entering y,x for your base station) will result in co-ordinates that look correct but are wrong.

gis,3ccjsh,manofthewild07,2,Tue Jul 7 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with being an ""environmental science"" student is that it is so broad. It really made me a jack of all trades. Although I minored in GIS, it was what everyone wanted from me. But, I didn't have enough experience. This was also the very middle of the recession, so there weren't many jobs.  I simply started out interning. Through one I met someone and started at another internship and through that internship met my now thesis adviser. Through her I've had paid internships at all kinds of places and will be starting full time at the USGS in September.  So from what I've found, 1) Apply yourself in school as much as you can. Learn more than you need to, whatever interests you. Whether its taking a GIS class and going one step further to learn some programming, or taking a general stats class, but learning how it can be applicable in your field, etc.  2) On that same note, get to know your professors. If they're actively engaged in finding grants and going to conferences, then they should either be able to help you find something to do or even employ you directly.  3) Intern, volunteer, etc. Get your name out there. Most jobs are given to people who are already known in a workplace. Its difficult to come in one time for an interview and beat out someone who personally knows someone there.  4) Specifically to your question, its tough to decide which way to go. I don't like limiting myself to one thing or another. Since beginning grad school, I've found thousands of new topics that I didn't even know existed that interest me.   But, you do need to develop one or two skills. We call it the T. You should have a breadth of knowledge but a depth of knowledge/skill in a subject or two. Fortunately, like I said, if you know your stuff and you show that to an employer, they won't really care what it is you know.  I have a background in, broadly, environmental science, but my thesis is on GIS groundwater vulnerability models. But, my USGS job involves using remote sensing to look at wetland change and in the future I'll be working on the spread of pathogens in the atmosphere.   Even though I have little experience with wetlands and pathogens, I'll be able to apply my skills with GIS/Remote Sensing and my ability to work through problems and answer questions to anything.  So in the end. Just do anything and everything until you find something you like. Then, if you want to take it to the next level, find a grad program that will work with you (and hopefully support you financially) to do it."

gis,3ccjsh,notmadeofbacon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:13:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats common and part of the problem with our current upper education system in the US.  These kids coming out of HS don't know what they want to do and don't know how to do it.  I also don't think it would be prudent to get a second bachelors and there aren't many associates programs or certificate programs that are going to help. Although starting with a few courses here and there, perhaps directly through companies might help. As for grad school, it depends on the program, but you might be able to find some physical geography type programs. The hard part is finding a way to apply that after school. The USGS does hire physical geographers and the like, but not often. The vast majority of positions are hydrologists, hydro-geologists, and those types of technicians. I imagine the best way to make physical geography work would be to continue onto a PhD, but then you'd be limited to federal gov't or academia."

gis,3c7eto,furrowsmiter,9,Sun Jul 5 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"Your methodology is pretty good!    Make sure you give a name to your columns (x, y, rotation) in excel.  When you add the data into ArcMap it will first just be a table. If you have trouble adding it, try saving it as .xls instead of xlsx. Csv also works. right click on it in the table of contents to display x, y data. A little menu will show up that should be self explanatory. Just go slow and read it. Remember that your other columns (eg rotation) will also be brought in even though you're only specifying the x, y columns. The labels in your excel spreadsheet will become field names in ArcMap. I'm on mobile right now so I'm being brief but if you have more questions I'll answer.  you should see your locations on the screen now but you aren't done. This is just a temporary display of the data but you'll need to create a more permanent copy on disk.  On this new x, y layer (and not your original excel data) you'll right click in the table of contents and want to export it to a shape file or whatever of your choosing.  now you can go on to symbolizing! You can use the symbology tab in your shape file properties menu to rotate the symbol by that attribute you brought in. If you need exact help on this, googling ""rotate symbol by attribute in ArcMap"" will get you what you need.    Edited to be a bit more specific."

Also your fields may not necessarily transfer as the appropriate type. For instance, you may have a column with dollar amounts, but the dollar sign or having a non-number values will force that column to be registered as a text field.  You would need to create a new field in ArcMap and use the Field Calculator to copy these values and transform them into the proper type.   Also, if you are working primarily in ArcGIS products, you will likely want to create a File Geodatabase  instead of shapefiles to organize your data."

For more on this concept I highly recommend the book Longitude.   To the task at hand -  Those coordinates are UTM coordinates, most likely in meters. The first location (the river) is in zone 14Q. Your coordinates indicate the distance north/west from the southeast corner of said UTM zone (again, most likely in meters...although I have seen UTM given in feet, sadly). So your first location is approximately 440Km north and 235Km west of the southeast corner of zone 14Q.

For more on this concept I highly recommend the book Longitude.   These conversions are incorrect because geographic coordinate systems have nothing to do with time. Degrees, minutes, and seconds are angular measurements for locating points on the surface of an ellipsoid and are measured from the centre of the earth. There are of course 360° in a circle (or along a single axis of spheroid), 60' (minutes) to a degree, and 60"" (seconds) to a minute. In the case of the World Geodetic System (WGS 1984), the 0° latitude is measured from the equator and the 0° longitude is measured from the prime meridian which originates from the north pole and through Greenwich, England.   Due to the fact that 1° longitude at the equator is ~111km and 10° longitude at the 60th latitude is ~55km, geographic coordinates must be projected to measure distances or areas on a 2-dimensional surface.  Hopefully this clears things up, as geodetics is a complex field of study and is difficult to understand. For me at least, understanding fundamentals of geodetics and its importance in using GIS didn't become clear until I became an advanced GIS user.

A couple things about your question which should hopefully reduce confusion:   The science & study of geographic information (GIS) makes use of these systems, and ArcGIS is an industry standard piece of software analysts/cartographers use to study the relationships between places/systems.

gis,3c2n9m,RandallWho,2,Sat Jul 4 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"Most of these folks are correct. Using collector requires a hosted web map from either portal or AGOL.   A note. If you register your AGS services in either (assuming unfederated server) and you don't want users to have a double log in ( once for the service and once for the portal/AGOL ) you will have to turn off security for virtual directories in server admin. It's a bug. A bug that opens up security holes. Please locate the bug and ask for it to be worked on, I'll find the link later and post."
gis,3c2n9m,R0b0d0nut,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would consider that a bug. The whole point of federating Portal/Server is to have a single user/role store. If you're not federated and you want to consume secured services through Portal, you'll have to pass one set of credentials to get to your web map in portal (unless it's a public web map, which doesn't work for collector, obviously) and another for the secured service from AGS.  One way to get around this without federating is to store the secured services as items in AGOL/Portal. You'll have to make sure that AGOL/Portal can access the services and that, if they're to be accessed over SSL, AGOL/Portal trusts the SSL certificate chain. A limitation of this is that if you use editor tracking all edits made will show as the user whose credentials were stored with the item rather than the user logged into AGOL/Portal. If you want to track that user, federate your Portal or use hosted services."

This is useful if you want to be able to look at a ton of stuff - IIRC ArcGIS Online's feature services have a max of 1000 records. If you roll your own infrastructure, you get to set the limits."

The backend only gets complex if the data is big. (What size is your organization?) About 8 people in my agency (state government), but it fluctuates. (Is there anything you would change?)

gis,3bygma,firm1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure either.  I guess it depends on the types of features you are trying to observe.  In your original post you said you want to ""to determine if the wetlands on the property are operating efficiently"".  Forgetting about UAV mapping, drones, photogrammetric software for a moment and just considering this more from the point of view of remote sensing concepts, how do you intend to extract or infer efficient operation of wetlands?  What metric or measure are you trying to capture to get at this?  Then consider what kind of observations are needed to make that measurement.  I have no clue what GSD is needed to assess if a wetland is operating efficiently.  Can you make that inference from water color?  then you probably don't need 5cm.  Do you just want aerial photos? Then get a < $300 KAP, kite aerial photography, set up...."
gis,3bygma,firm1,3,Fri Jul 3 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"I have used both photscan and pix4d and they are both pretty intuitive and easy to use. If your end goal is a surface model and/or mosaic then either will do the job. For doing bare earth modeling they are a little lacking and you would probably want to bring the data into some other software like QGIS, actually you may want to make your final maps in QGIS either way.   I can't really comment on the web based stuff, but there is also open drone map and bundler, both of which should at least do the 3d reconstruction. Pix4d also has monthly rental pricing I believe, so if you only do a few projects a year, you might consider that.    If you the decision to get the inspire is not set in stone, you may want to consider getting a pixhawk based platform like the iris+ or solo, both of which include many nice mapping features such as waypoint flying and the ability to insert gps data into the image exif info. They can also trigger the camera based on distance and have a nice ground station that you can do flight planning on (if you fence an area it will automatically make a flight plan to cover it). I have a pixhawk with 2 cameras (RGB and NIR) mounted that I use and it works very well for smaller areas, but it does require some time and patience to set up properly.   If you are looking to get best area coverage, then you might want to consider a fixed wing, but they have a little more of a learning curve to flying them.   Regardless of what you get, if you have not piloted a quadcopter before, you should invest in a micro to learn the basics. The hubsan is a popular choice. It is much better to crash one of these than a $1000+ platform.  Have you given any thought to ground control? What types of accuracy are you looking for? Are you planning collect points in the field?"

If you're using ArcMap (I assume you are) try using the ""point to raster"" tool. This will let you assign the elevation field from your points as the value of the raster, and you can set the cell size with the distribution of your points (i.e. each point is collected 5m from the last point in a grid, you should have a value from every cell).   You might have to do some resampling once you have your raster to account for areas where raster cells didn't have a point to draw it's value from (probably cubic convolution or nearest neighbor). Once you have your home made DEM raster, I would make a hillshade for display on a web map.  Oh also, if you don't want to go through this mess, there's a tool in ArcGIS called ""TIN to Raster"".

For this, you can upload your data in many formats to ArcGIS Online and then publish those data as a service.  You can add your published service to the JavaScript example above - just swap it out with the sampleserver service that the example is using.  You can play around with it right in your browser by clicking ""Explore in the sandbox"" once you get your service published.

gis,3bv9q0,RampagingKittens,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:08 2015 UTC,I definitely believe that! And I understand your interest in it. I'm a woman and I work in GIS at an engineering company. The whole topic just came off as a bit awkward with your approach and it was bound to not be received well. Discussing minority status with the majority is always tough.

I didn't see her asking at all how to take advantage of affirmative action, or even undertones of such a thing. She was polling us to get an idea of representation in the workplace. I'm not sure how you pulled anything else out of that, except for maybe your own sneaking suspicions. I think I've read all her comments in this thread and while they've had a pretty terrible attitude, she hasn't said that which you accuse her of (unless I missed something)."

I usually try to refrain, but I was genuinely curious since I'm only just starting out. Right now I kinda just keep to myself in my own cubicle and I don't know many people on my floor, so considering that and the fact I haven't been working long, I feel like I don't have a really good understanding of what the industry is like at all.

gis,3bv9q0,minorsecond,-1,Thu Jul 2 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well my decision to pursue GIS isn't really hinged on whether or not there are other black women already in it. I was told that IT is very male dominated, but I wanted to hear from GIS professionals themselves and get their perspective on the diversity in the industry.

You will face real problems where people don't respect your skills because you are a woman in IT. So it could be harder to advance based on your skills. Even if you don't run into these problems and advance yourself based on your own skills, others will think you advanced just because ""you were treated special"".   My best advice.

Here is the changelog: http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.10/  And FTA, the highlighted new features worth noting:   New zonal statistics features: The old build-in function only served a limited number of stats. This is providing way more freedom of choice. Improved geometry rotation tool: it’s easier than ever to rotate vector data when digitizing. Especially for the guys in the field of line documentation (gas/oil/water/electricity) this might be helpful. Layers with joins can now be filtered: I have to admit that I hate joins. I love it all in one file. But with this nice function you can apply a filter on the attributes of the “master” file. Visualise and modify the graduated renderer using a histogram: A nice and convenient way of altering your colour scheme according to the visual distribution of data. Live layer effects for layers and symbol layers: If you want to create stunning maps, this is definitely for you."

As far as how complex or what scripts to write, that depends entirely on what your task is. You could do simple things like iterate through a gdb and apply editor tracking, add fields, create cursor objects to edit data, recursively list data sources for every mxd in a root directory, or automatically publish map services with the correct parameters in place.  There's a lot to do and you will learn a lot as you do them but it's hard to know what is expected until the need arises. Codecademy assists with syntax, but building things and figuring out how to do what you need to do actually teaches you how to code.  I'm guessing you want to know what to put on a resume as far as how you rank wit python skills? I would put 'Familiar' if you can write geoprocessing scripts using arcpy. Its a valuable skill, but keep in mind arcpy is only one library and it does a good job of holding your hand. If you want to get better start learning the core libraries and practice basic concepts like loops, functions, classes, string manipulation, list comprehension etc. Then look into some of the other gis related libraries and become familiar with when to apply them and how the work generally.  So in short, you should be fine to put it on your resume, just back it up with example code and be able to talk about it in an interview."
gis,3bjslw,bradrulez69,2,Mon Jun 29 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this reply. I appreciate it a ton! I just have a few questions:  Does ""Familiar"" on a resume sound better than ""Intermediate""?   When I bring the example scripts in, can it just be another page in my GIS portfolio? Is it even worth adding simple scripts to a portfolio (online or print)?"
gis,3bjslw,Eogris,4,Mon Jun 29 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yes include script images that you can fully explain to someone.  If you put intermediate, you better truly be intermediate."
gis,3bjslw,bradrulez69,3,Mon Jun 29 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"Its always good to have a full portfolio. I would set up a github and put them up there, then a link in your resume.  I'd be hesitant to put intermediate on the resume, it implies you have a bit more real world dev experience. Typically when I think of intermediate I think of someone who can debug quickly, has decent knowledge of the built in libraries, has experience with a bunch of third party libraries, has developed a lot of problem solving skills that are essential in cs.   You seem to be more than a beginner, so i think you could just list python (without adjectives) or familiar with python and back it up with your work. Its tough in this stage when you have a good grasp of the basics but need more time and exposure to problems. Its hard to get that without specific tasks and many courses/materials are for absolute beginners or for more advanced topics. This article talks about it a little bit.  But don't be discouraged, you have a lot of time and things to learn. Keep in mind >80% of GIS people I've met have no idea how to script, even high up analysts and managers. I'm the only one in my office besides the web devs who can do it and people are so impressed with the simplest stuff. Most people didn't even know you could script most of the things I have. You will make waves as an entry-level person who can bust out working scripts that get the job done. Just keep learning and working and you will be fine :)"

We took their existing forms, setup a basic Collector form to show them how it would work, and then demoed it.

gis,3bkvqg,xod1ak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying ArcGIS for server IS NOT the way to go you just need to understand it's role and difference between 3rd party apps like CityView. CityView for example is a stand-alone application to manage the permitting process. (I'm sure you knew that). ArcGIS for server is basically a software that allows you to serve maps... In the most basic sense. There are applications that can are available and can be developed to accomplish what you are wanting to do. But the programming / skill level is probably pretty high to accomplish that. I have dealt with a couple of consulting companies that provide web mapping services that also have developed permitting applications. I too was in a small community at the time and it was just too expensive. (so is ArcGIS for server) At my last job we got a software / hardware bundle from ESRI and ArcGIS for Server (standard) and a server was almost $13,000 with a $3,000 / year maintenance for the software.    Keeping all that in mind, I would recommend a simpler approach allowing you to use the tools you already have.  We just implemented something similar at my new job for a client. Not in the realm of permitting but taking archaic maps and processes and at least making it available to city staff. Scanned inspection reports, pictures and video are hotlinked through the feature and it's all viewed through ArcReader. You could use Access, for example, to store your permitting data, manage your features through ArcGIS (linking to the permitting data as needed) and distributing to city / county staff through ArcReader.    I'm not saying this is the best option for you. It's probably (definitely) the most affordable. The only thing you would have to purchase that you don't have is a Publisher license ($2,500) and MS Office professional (to get Access). ArcReader is free.    edit: Access would be your permitting front end to enter the and store the permitting information."

You have two point shapefiles the 1st is the original and the 2nd is identical to the 1st but some features have been updated (moved to a different location and/or changed attribution). To find those points that have been moved you can do a select by location of shapefile 2 (target layer) using shapefile 1 as your source layer. For your spatial selection method you'll choose ""are identical to the source layer feature"". Then you'll just reverse the selection. If you're not dealing with subtypes (which would complicate copying and pasting because if you have multiple subtypes copied you can only paste them into one subtype) then you can just copy and paste (or append) the newly selected features into shapefile 1.

You can expand it via plugins so that it does heavier stuff. Very customizable. Personally what I use, my job is to make custom sites and   ArcGIS JS API: Big, heavy Javascript mapping library so you need a little coding experience. You can do more processing with it without adding plugins and it interacts well with ArcGIS products. Haven't worked with it myself but I hear Leaflet is easier to work with.  AGOL: No coding required, just give it some data and you can have a map online in 10 minutes. Not as flexible, but really easy to use and there's a ton of ArcGIS integration.  ESRI-Leaflet: Allows you to add ArcGIS integration to Leaflet. It's a plugin that goes on top of Leaflet.  D3: Data visualization library. Usually used to make awesome charts.

gis,3bfmv2,EvilEyeJoe,3,Mon Jun 29 10:22:07 2015 UTC,"If your goal is to just embed a map within a webpage, ArcGIS Online is a really simple solution and fairly straightforward. For people or organizations already tied into the ESRI ecosystem, it is a great option. Most of the people I know that use Leaflet consistently are pretty heavily invested in the Open Source nature of it. They may use ArcMap at work, but when they do their own projects they don't want to be tied into an expensive ecosystem when they could invest a little more effort and have something that looks better with free tools. So they process their data in Q-GIS, output a Geo-JSON and integrate it into Leaflet. This gives them access to a wider variety of basemaps that in my opinion tend to look better than the Stock ESRI ones.   Additionally because Leaflet is running JavaScript, it can interact with other parts of the webpage if you know what you're doing. This is an example that someone I know built with Leaflet. http://cityhubla.github.io/LA_Building_Age/#12/34.0267/-118.2621 To my knowledge the interaction with the CSS Stopwatch Icon in the top menu is not something that could currently be achieved directly from ArcGIS Online.  Because ESRI-Leaflet exists, an organization that is already embedded in the ESRI ecosystem can still get the customizability of Leaflet without having to sacrifice the convenience of ArcGIS Online services. They can host a service and pull that into the map rather than rendering a locally hosted GeoJSON.  As far as what you should be focusing on... That depends on what your goal is. If you want to work for an employer that would likely be embedded in the ESRI ecosystem, then showing you can integrate ESRI services into projects would be a good goal. If you're a web developer hoping to offer your clients web maps as part of your work, I wouldn't feel obligated to focus on ESRI. You can learn all the skills you need without the cost and if you ever had a client that was already using ESRI, the ESRI-Leaflet API is easy to learn once you understand Leaflet basics."

Once you have it open in Q-Gis you can use Save As to convert it to a Geo-JSON.  Everything I've learned about the Open-Source options for mapping and Geoprocessing has been through my local Maptime chapter. If you're in a city that has one, it's a great resource.

Also, I don't have any experience in Programming   If you want to take the difficult path and succeed, your best chances are as a programmer. GIS is not about maps. As you said, GIS is about data. You cannot truly unlock the potential of GIS until you learn how to automate manipulation of data on a large scale. You absolutely cannot do that without learning how to program. And no, FME does not count.  You can teach yourself how to program at home with some free courses. Python is the GIS language. I recommend Learn Python the Hard Way. Javascript is the way to go for web development. Learn about OSGeo and Leaflet. Ignore Silverlight and Flex, they are going away. Learn HTML/CSS/Javascript and create a little webpage portfolio for yourself. Get a GitHub. Contribute to open source projects. Continually.

The fact that you are working on Codecademy and taking classes at a community college would be enough to show me that you are serious about learning these skills and with a solid resume would probably get you an interview. If you take those skills and have the motivation to apply them to a cool side project to show off then you're a lot further than most at the GIS entry level. This all depends on career goals and exactly what job you'd like to do. If you want to program and build mapping applications then I don't think school is necessary as long as you pursue those interests and develop them. If you want to be a developer building GIS software then a degree in CS and/or GIS wouldn't hurt you, but probably not a BA. All of the skills you mentioned can be learned on the job in the right role. Some people need the motivation and accountability of school to keep them moving in the right direction. There's nothing wrong with that but adding a second undergrad degree just won't help your case enough to justify the cost.    Out of eight people on our GIS team: 4 have a degree in GIS, 3 have a degree in a science field and 1 has a degree in geology. We work for a city government.

The reason for the consideration for my BA is because most entry level jobs in GIS require a degree in Geography/Environmental Science/Computer science at the very least. I feel like if I apply anyway, I won't have the leverage like others because I've only taken two GIS classes in my undergrad. I am still young, no loans, and only 55 credits left to complete the BA so I can knock that out in a year.   Some people need the motivation and accountability of school to keep them moving in the right direction.    I feel this is totally my case. I want to build mapping applications and eventually develop GIS software, so the community college classes will definitely help me in the right direction. Other than those classes, I feel a bit lost on how to develop my interests an skills further. My plan is to start looking at getting familiar with Leaflet and Mapbox.

However, I ended up going back to school to earn my GIS certificate after initially earning my Ba and not being able to find a job. The networking with fellow classmates and other industry people was why it was largely worth it. Much of that is due to where I went to school though, it's a great culture and program although overlooked by many because it was relatively small.    I you want to learn programming then learn basic CS principals and maybe take a class in C or other object oriented programming. Build an Open source stack from scratch. Look at the Open Geo Suite, rent a VPS for $20 a month and try to build the stack from scratch on a Linux machine. After its up and running then try and build some web applications running from your own stack/environment. It will take time and effort but you're understanding of GIS will pass up pretty much everyone with a BA.    I was lucky enough that I had the opportunity to do this in school but it has made me stand out in my new job. I'm a GIS Manager two years out of earning my GIS certificate. Good luck and just identify a goal and work towards what will make you happy!"

A B.S. in geology is more valuable than a B.A. in geography.

It's a great way to waste a few years and end up in only a slightly better position, and that's if you bust your ass as a student finding part-time jobs that are more relevant to your career goals.  If you want to do GIS, find a GIS-oriented internship or job that will pay for workshops and classes. Build your career that way.

A state's area has nothing to do with its legislative process. All it does is introduce distortion into the shape of the country for no real purpose.  I like the color scheme in the pre-supreme court ruling map. But there really isn't a need for there to be two maps in the first place. The entire after-ruling map could be replaced by simply altering the legend in the pre-ruling map from ""Banned by state law"" to ""Previously banned by state law."""
gis,3b7y8x,TS_finch,3,Fri Jun 26 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"A state's area has nothing to do with its legislative process.    That's sort of the point? Area data doesn't necessarily add to the clarity of the map. By giving the states equal visual weight, the idea is to make the map more readable. So the shapes are still roughly in the correct geographical relationship but it's easier to tell apart all the northeast states. If it's a small side graphic or an animation, I think the design advantage is more apparent. For whatever reason hex/square equal area cartogram has become something of a trend. Another example. I prefer this color scheme."
gis,3b7y8x,giselle987,0,Sat Jun 27 04:15:55 2015 UTC,"By giving the states equal weight, the idea is to make the map more readable   And in making them all hexagons, the designer did exactly the opposite of that.

gis,3b7y8x,TS_finch,3,Sat Jun 27 04:25:33 2015 UTC,"The states are in roughly the same arrangement, save for a few compromises (placement of North/South Carolina). I think squares work better personally, but it's an interesting design approach that seems to be catching on with a lot of people..."

That's a pretty heavy geographical bias introduced, because of the size differences.  Since size≠population, I can see wanting to avoid that.  This makes it strictly about numbers.  I'd honestly rather see it on a population distorted map than either an equal area or usual projection.  Good comment about the colors - I'm not a fan of the blue/light-blue distinction too - that's not super helpful to me."
gis,3b7y8x,giselle987,2,Fri Jun 26 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you on this one.  Distortion is relative.  While the equal area may oversize the smaller states, the reverse may be true for the standard projections in overemphasizing western states versus their population.  I think the ratio of purely numerical states is an interesting look at the country - equivalent to the US Senate representation of political geography.  It also fits the typical conversational narrative of ""x out of 50 states.""   Sure population weighted cartograms are another approach but they are usually so distorted beyond easy geographic recognition.   I do think the maps are a little redundant, as the right hand map reinforces what was already inferred on the first map."
gis,3b7y8x,flippmoke,2,Fri Jun 26 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, by giving the states equal visual weight it's easier to process the info the map is trying to convey (especially if for eg you're just quickly scrolling by it on a news article)"

gis,3b6kkx,sunlollyking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:28:26 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to do it over the whole image? I think generally people will do the calculations over a homogeneous area in the image; taking the mean of an area and dividing it by the standard deviation. If you have Arc and spatial analyst you can make a region polygon and do zonal stats as table over the regions. Then its just a matter of dividing the mean by the stdev for each region. If you are doing it over the whole image then you could probably just use the summary stats to get your mean and stdev from and skip the zonal stats step.    For the whole image something like this should work (again assuming you have arc):  def SNR(image, band):     arcpy.CalculateStatitistics_management(image)     mean_result=arcpy.GetRasterProperties(image, ""MEAN"", band)     mean=mean_result.getOutput(0)     std_result=arcpy.GetRasterProperties(image, ""STD"", band)     std=std_result.getOutput(0)     snr=mean/std     return snr   You can probably do the same thing with PIL if you don't have Arc.

That said, since we make the data available to others this means that a) if they mess their copy up they can come to us for a copy of the original and b) we don't touch our originals, and we regular backups to ensure that the originals stay untouched.

Go to indeed.com and search for 'GIS electric' with no location specified. Look at the cities filter on the left. All those jobs are possibilities.    Given your background you should look for a Technician or Mapping job (old school utilities still grade them mappers).

They are written for keyword searches and internal pay grade justifications. Utilities are desperate for people that can tell the difference between a power pole and a telephone pedestal.  You use GIS software already, so that is important for your resume. Now, get a copy of ArcMap and do a small project. Ask your employer for a copy. They probably have one but more importantly it shows you are interested in learning new things. Field guys are easy to keep stuck in one role as long as they are making money. So do some tutorials so you can make a map in an interview.    Do a small project that does some analysis and has an output. Find all the locations where two pieces of equipment are within 20 feet of each other. Then summarize with graphs of the types of equipment. Make a map, do some light statistics, and write it up. Pretend it is for the utility who is contracting you.  Copy their logo from the website, put it on the first page. Write it as if they will hire you. The mindset is important.

It would look something like this: fill sinks > raster calculator the difference between it and the original DEM If you're looking to filter genuine karst depressions from man made features, then there's no automated way to do that. The best method would be to take the sinkhole file you made and manually compare it with aerial imagery, road layers, and a hillshade. The only way I see that process getting automated is after years of advances in AI technology. I've already done some work on this for Tennessee (http://tnlandforms.us/landforms/sinks.php).

Someone asked me about this in a private message recently here and here was my response:  I got a degree in Aerospace Engineering, almost none of it helps me in my current job besides the fact that I know more advanced math. I taught myself to program because it was something I had fun doing. During college I worked for a variety of different places, writing software at Pratt Whitney, a Social Networking startup, and even did construction work :).  After college got a job working for the FAA doing algorithmic development and safety analysis on WAAS, which I guess gave my first real introduction into using spatial data. This was mostly heavy Python and Matlab work. I decided I hated working for the government so I got another job.  Next job was working for a weather company, WDT. I spent most of my time there working on making weather APIs, in particular a tile image API to power weather maps like this. This was where I started to really dig into GIS software, started working with libraries like GDAL and Mapnik a lot.  Always dreamed of working at Mapbox, once I heard they were interested in me because of some of the work I had done, I left and joined them just this year. Now work almost full time on Mapnik and loving it.  My best advice I can give is:   The best developers love programming and love hard problems. You will advance more by teaching yourself and teaching others then sitting in a classroom. If you have to explain something to someone else, it forces you to learn it deeper. Expect to hate some things you made in the past, because technologies and your knowledge grow over time. Accept that you are making mistakes but that is okay."

Essentially, WAAS is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including precision approaches to any airport within its coverage area.   WAAS uses a network of ground-based reference stations, in North America and Hawaii, to measure small variations in the GPS satellites' signals in the western hemisphere. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary WAAS satellites in a timely manner (every 5 seconds or better). Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where WAAS-enabled GPS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy.  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) calls this type of system a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs, the Indian GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), respectively.

gis,3aze94,bradhuds,2,Thu Jun 25 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"There's basically two broad categories of skills you need to develop - coding and spatial skills.  The first can be picked up pretty easily using things like Code Academy.  Right now the hot things in GIS coding are Javascript for online stuff and Python for customization stuff.  The trick is to learn by doing projects.... even if they're made up projects.  Going through tutorials will only take you so far.  You've got to learn by doing so you can understand the bits you need and the bits you don't need for any given purpose.  I tell people I teach to make up projects if they have to.  Make a map of football drafts and where they're coming from and going to.  Make a map showing your personal favorite eating spots.  Figure out a shortest path or a quickest path between them.  Write a program that asks you what food you want to eat (say tacos) then figures out the quickest path from your current location to your favorite restaurant that has that food.  Anything really.  It doesn't matter what it is and it doesn't matter if something like that exists.  The whole point is to learn the process, not necessarily make the next great mashup/online tool.  That'll come after you learn how the process works.  The spatial skills are tougher to learn on your own.  You really need to understand data types (points, lines, polygons, and rasters) and their limitations.  You really need to understand basic geography ideas like scale and projections.  You need to understand more complex issues like ecological fallacy, edge effects, and modifiable aerial unit problems.  Those are harder to pick up after the fact because you don't know what you don't know.  There's a LOT of people out there who make REALLY bad maps because they don't understand these basic issues.  For instance this map (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/28/the-most-racist-places-in-america-according-to-google/ ).  That's a HORRIBLE map that a lot of well meaning places are reporting as science but in reality it's utter crap.  It's because they don't understand these basic issues.    The only way I can think to learn that stuff is an intro to GIS course.  I know geocommons has some basic text books.  I'd read those a bit.  I'd also do what you're already doing, which is ask questions.  That's the stuff that comes to mind right away."

There are plenty of books with GIS techniques for archaeology. The ESRI ArcUser magazine has an archaeology article every couple of issues. What else? Tell them to check the journals for SAA (Society of American Archaeology), there are usually a ton of GIS articles in there as well.  As far as helping them in a career, just be sure you set them up with a wide variety of skills in GIS, the more they know, the better.

But now with Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy there are more and more programs developing people specifically for that field.   Is that what you've seen and do you see those jobs continuing to grow?

But as soon as you begin to incorporate GIS into them folks wonder how they ever lived without them.   I do believe that GIS is going to emerge as a big player in emergency management operations - both in risk assessment before an event and in mitigation after an event has occurred. We're seeing this now with GeoInt summits all over the place. That intelligence is supporting counter-terrorism effforts and emergency management operations.

So, I went back to school and went in debt, chose a major which had growth when I signed up for it and that I really truly love (I absolutely LOVE making maps) but I can't get a job anywhere and it's so frustrating."
gis,3aw78c,Toshibi,2,Wed Jun 24 01:43:22 2015 UTC,If you have been programming for 30 years may I ask how old you are? If you are applying for entry level GIS positions but are 45 or 50 some places could have a concern.  Just my personal opinion.
gis,3aw78c,bjy20716,2,Wed Jun 24 14:30:31 2015 UTC,I'm 35. I started learning how to program at 5. I usually only mention that I have been programming for a few years.
gis,3aw78c,Toshibi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe try reworking your resume? It sucks that you have to dumb down your skills for some jobs but it might work in your favor. I have a friend from school who is doing amazing things in GIS. I'm in the Bay Area and go to all sorts of networking events and have only found a couple people with the drive and motivation doing similar things doing what he is doing...and they're running companies. This friend can't find a job in GIS though. He's eccentric in a good way and wouldn't fit many company cultures so he gets passed over constantly.    Not getting the job definitely says nothing about you as an individual but it is hard to get past when there's a lot of rejection. I spent almost 3 years in the GIS job market, but now I'm a GIS Manager after a year in an ""entry level"" position. When the fit and time is right, the job will come and it will be worth it. A big thing that helped me finally get a job was letting go of being ""professional"" and letting my personality shine through. I'm open, honest, don't care about politics and share a little too much information all the time. In the public sector this can work to get things done and they recognized me for that.    tl;dr It sucks but the time will come and you'll blow everyone out of the water with your skills."
gis,3aw78c,aintnoshameinmygame,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"I've reworked my resume a few times and it's pretty solid. I think my problem is when I get to the interviews. I get really nervous. Also, a lot of the jobs I've had interviews for they wanted someone that was more Civil Engineer and less GIS guy (I get the interview and then I look like an idiot because I know nothing about Water/Sewer systems or the like). Anyhow, I have a second interview next week as a GIS Specialist where it's more GIS and IT.  I also have a problem where I am all business during interviews, so I should probably relax and be my usual fun self."
gis,3aw78c,Toshibi,2,Wed Jun 24 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"The latter part was always the real problem for me. I am not that nervous of a person but when I care I become all professional and start to sound like I'm reading from a script rather than letting my personality through. Of course the personality comes through when I don't give a shit and am more relaxed. Usually for the jobs I could care less about, go figure...    Good luck!"

My friend got a job with an oil company right out of college making 60k+ bonuses. Private sector in general pays a lot more, but many people feel that public is more rewarding in other ways."
gis,3aw78c,bjy20716,3,Wed Jun 24 12:37:40 2015 UTC,It also depends on location but that 38 to 45 is a good estimate in my opinion for the east and west coast.   Montana. Iowa. Nebraska. Kentucky. Tennessee etc I would guess under 40.  Probably 28 to 38.

There is a reason so much of the auto industry is contract/vendor now rather than being contained within the auto makers themselves. I know people who were GIS folks at GM in 2007 and now people with MBA's are making the maps and doing the demographic work they used to do. Its more efficient for the company and for the people involved.  Its easier to hold someone with a internship for a few reasons. You aren't obligated to pay benefits (or pay at all in some instances), can generally pay lower, and there isn't much obligation to keep them around when the budgets get tighter. But if the money keeps rolling in, you just hold on to them until someone starts pushing."

gis,3av3vh,Mapcycler,3,Tue Jun 23 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"$95 every 3 years.   Nope.   After July 1, 2015 the certification process will include a $ 100 application fee, a $ 250 exam fee, and a $ 100 portfolio review fee.   Upon completion of the certification process, an individual will be certified for a 3 year period.  Annual renewal fees of $95 are due on the anniversary of initial certification and will be required to be paid in full prior to recertification.  Recertification of the GISP will be required at the end of the 3 year period with a procedure similar to the current review process where submission of information on completed continuing education and service to the profession is required.   Experience and examples of live running sites look VERY good. A GISP cert suggests to me an applicant may not be confident enough in their experience and aptitude, and needs some extra letters behind their name to make up for it."
gis,3av3vh,DataMechanic,2,Wed Jun 24 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, 95 a year?  While I agree with you, and I don't think a GISP is necessary, but like most certifications, it IS given credit.

I went through funemployment last year and of the 15 or so interviews I had every one of them asked if I had my GISP or was in the process of getting it. One engineering firm actually required it.

However, you could theoretically just be a dues paying member to 10 different organizations for a few years, contributing nothing academically, and still get your credit.  The GISP will mean a lot more with the test.    That being said, a resume listing all of your committees and presentations carries more weight than four letters currently"
gis,3av3vh,Nojopar,0,Thu Jun 25 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"So you actually got your GISP the ""hard way"", and yet your calling it a veneer of an organization? I don't get it..."

Which is cool, except that it waters down what the certification should mean. IMHO I think contributions to the field should require more ACTIVE participation and volunteer time should be worth more points.  Also, unlike many other trade organizations, it did not require an examination to prove you knew what you were talking about.  (This has changed obviously)"

A couple of states like North Carolina have crazy ass rules about who can and can't do GIS, mostly to protect surveyors from having to innovate (ooops!  Did I say that out loud?)  I can see GISP mattering in those contexts.  Engineering firms somehow think the GISP is like the PE, which I don't get at all.  They're probably the only ones that put stock in the thing.  Every hiring committee I've ever been on since the GISP was created has asked if someone had a GISP or not.  Not one of them used it even remotely in the actual decision on who to hire.  At the current $250 for 5 years, eh, sure pick one up.  Why the hell not?  At $95 a year?  I wouldn't bother.  Make a couple of great online maps and that'll top any GISP any day of the week."

Now the problem is ---  the gatekeepers.  All those low-quality GISP's who don't want to lose their role in the process.   This new ""test"" may start the GISP certification down a path of ""higher quality"",  but you still have the underlying problem of ""who is creating the GISP tests, and what are their priorities?"" ....  and a lot of GISP's  are bureaucrats, metadata nazis, ESRI cultists, and a wide variety of non-innovating, low-skilled people."

What do you base this on?! Are you a GISP? Because I am, and it takes a lot more than ""just showing up."" Yes, it's pretty easy to get education and work experience points for the application, but the Contributions section takes very intentional effort and time commitment. It's not something you just fall into without having a high level of enthusiasm and passion for GIS technology. The reason there has never been a test, is because the certification wasn't originally designed to be a measure of technical ability.

You can use good or poor practices no matter what language you end up using.   Python or JavaScript (different than Java!) would be a fine place to start. The learning curve for either one goes something like this:   (days to weeks) It's dead easy to get started and make SOMETHING, so you feel good.  (weeks to months, up to a year) You know what you want to do, but it's a terrible mind-numbing struggle. Your scripts sort of work and co-workers or fellow students help you debug and make them right.  (a year+) Everything seems to fall into place. You can conceive a project and identify potential pitfalls before you begin writing code. You help your co-workers debug their scripts. -- Most people who want to can reach this level of expertise without too much trouble (several years+) Expert level.. You find and fix bugs in the libraries you're using and frequently hit their limitations.    Python is used a lot on the desktop. There are a lot of scientific libraries for it so it would serve you well whether you end up doing bio or GIS. It can also be used for general purpose system scripting or (less often) making websites.   JavaScript is mostly used in the web browser. If you're interested in making web maps or web based charts then JavaScript is a good option. JavaScript would open all sorts of non-GIS web development opportunities too.

gis,3ar9f3,hookemflip,2,Tue Jun 23 02:53:02 2015 UTC,"I would say to remove that.  If you are applying for gis jobs highlight your gis skills.  Talk more in depth about projects, skills used to complete projects, teamwork accomplishments, things that translate into being able to work using those skills you learned.  You losing money has no relevance to a gis job, and may translate to hiring managers more about poor decision making than willing to take a risk."
gis,3ar9f3,TheDEW,3,Tue Jun 23 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, I recently graduated from JSU with a BS in geography (GIS and Hazards) and a minor in Emergency Management. I graduated with 17 job offers from the public sector in hand. The best thing I would suggest for you to do is network and get your name out there, make yourself some business cards and a website, have pdf file with your maps, certs, and resume on it ready to email it to anyone you come in contact with. I would also suggest going to conferences like, floodplain management, meteorology, emergency management, engineer, and 9-1-1 / first responders. Every time I would go to an interview or meeting I would create maps of area, 1 year plans, and have thought provoking questions for them. I had a lot of success doing this. I would also suggest that you should email your resumes to agencies and departments, because sometimes they might not be advertising positions, but they might be thinking about hiring someone. If you have anymore questions feel free to message me and best of luck."

gis,3ar9f3,NORTHAMERICAN_SCUM,2,Tue Jun 23 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, or applying to jobs that just require a resume. Many entry-level GIS positions are filled though staffing agencies, which can have very generic application processes. Response rates from recruiters are very high, and you should use that initial contact as an opportunity to learn as much about the position as you can. It should be easy to be very well prepared for an interview that a recruiter has set up for you with a hiring manager."

Luckily, I got that job.   Ask professors/staff in the department where some of their former students ended up. I was fortunate to get the job I did because everyone in that company's GIS department went to the same university I did.  Also, I volunteered to do GIS work for our Cartography department. They had paid student employees, but it was too late for me to get paid, so I told them I'd do the work for free. Not sure if adding that on my resume helped or not, but it looked nice to have ""internship"" on there (even if it was unpaid)."

I think I started applying about 6 months before I graduated  But I ended up finding one about 2 months after graduation  I probably sent 30 or 40 GIS job applications out in that time period, and I think I maybe had 4 or 5 interviews over the phone before someone gave me an offer.  I took the first offer that came along.  Oddly enough, the interviews I have now (further in my career) are much easier than they were at the beginning.  Those early interviews were, in retrospect,  bizarre ""tests"" of very specific GIS vocabulary.   Are there any tips you like to share for recent graduates?   start looking before you graduate.  do what you've gotta do to get paid experience under your belt.  i was pretty much willing to move anywhere.   How about temp agencies?   They suck, but if it's what gets your foot in the door,  go for it. My first job was with a staffing firm that was hiring for a federal contractor.  It was a miserable job,   I moved to some weird city by myself, but I stayed for 8 months and it was a paycheck.

I told them my name.  I got to talk to a lot of people this way. My key was not trying to be too self-promotional - just asking what needs they had. One company eventually gave me an interview.

And if you're Google and you want to be a part of the exploding GIS industry, do you spend years and hundreds of millions to develop and market your own GIS product that will spend its entire life playing catch-up to the company that invented the industry, or do you just buy that company and its huge market share and call it a day?  Esri's monetary value is large, but it's peanuts compared to Google's buying power.  Even before this 'partnership' was announced, I was pretty skeptical that Google wouldn't make a play at the industry somehow, given they're in basically every part of the market place except this.  This 'partnership' makes everything fall together."

gis,3ap2w6,chronographer,3,Mon Jun 22 10:11:00 2015 UTC,"We have it and have had it for a while.    The big question you should ask is ""Why?""   The Esri product is faster, the interface is much more intuitive, and there are many thousands of people and organizations using it vs. Intergraph's dozen or so, meaning your user community to find tweaks and fixes is much, much more robust.  Does Webmap work?  Yup.  But going that direction instead of the industry standard would be bucking the trend just for the sake of bucking the trend without any functional advantage gained.  Plus, the ArcGIS Online environment is pretty awesome these days, and Intergraph doesn't have anything equivalent to it, thus with Server and AGO you have a pretty solid, scalable setup for about the same price range as Webmap professional, which doesn't have any of AGO's functionality."
gis,3ap2w6,anthropwn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:41:52 2015 UTC,Good answer. Why are you still using WebMap?
gis,3ap2w6,anthropwn,2,Mon Jun 22 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"We've historically been primarily Intergraph users for one asset dataset, but that is changing rather quickly, with pretty much everything else being Esri already.  We have a couple of legacy web applications that were originally built on Webmap, and they work, so there's no reason to spend a bunch of time and money switching them to a different platform when they'll be deprecated out in a couple years anyway."
gis,3ap2w6,anthropwn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"Right, so you're already using both..."
gis,3ap2w6,anthropwn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yes.  If this is a blank-slate, ground-up kind of thing, I think you'd still have difficulty justifying anything from the Intergraph portfolio.  Here's why:   Their customer base is very small, so you immediately lose that great user community that's built around the Esri products.  Open source solutions also typically have pretty active user communities.  Try to find an Intergraph user forum. The core products are pretty far behind the rest of the market.  GeoMedia has no scripting ability (other than clunky .NET objects programming), no real process automation ability, no Python module, no equivalent to Model Builder, and no specialized extensions/toolboxes.  Webmap works, but it's just a matter of time until it suffers the same fate as the rest of the product suite. Because nobody uses the product, everybody you try to hire will need to be trained from scratch.  The concepts are similar, sure, but you hire an experienced tech for their knowledge, right?  A significant part of that knowledge is knowing how to use the tools, and you negate that moving to a different platform. ""Anything but Esri"" isn't much of an excuse, but it's one a lot of people use.  In that case, you're far, far better moving to open-source when possible rather than tie yourself to a niche commercial vendor."
gis,3ancsd,maceireann,5,Sun Jun 21 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with these exams is that they don't properly test your knowledge. They ask questions that are tricks. There are 4 answers. Usually 2-3 are right, but you have to find the MOST right answer. The problem is that often the questions are filled with double negatives to trip you up. That makes these types of questions into more of a reading comprehension test.  My other issue is that they often ask too specific of questions. You can see these in the sample questions available online. Sometimes they will ask what license level is required for a specific tool. This is obviously not testing gis knowledge in any way, as any user would just look that up to make sure.   I know esri is working on making them better. But that takes time. The people best suited to write these tests don't have the time, as they have other stuff to do."

gis,3ancsd,Tsarcazm,6,Mon Jun 22 13:19:43 2015 UTC,Do you really think these certs are worth it? Compared to just having work/project experience that displays your abilities? I say this because I find it a bit ridiculous that a certification that costs $225 does not inform you what a passing score is or what yours was.
gis,3ancsd,tforward,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think criticism of exam feedback is totally valid. I'm not critical of the cert as a whole. Other online feedback from test takers criticize this particular aspect of the exam (i.e. feedback, though those who fail are most likely to go online and post negative feedback). I do think the exam is appropriately broad, seeing as it asks questions about the entire ESRI suite, and it is written by ESRI after all. Without violating my NDA, I might like to see less application specific ""what thing do you right click on to get to that other thing"" type questions. They have extensive preparation resources and perhaps, I just didn't take advantage of them.  I think that these certs do a good job of targeting specific levels of experience. There are three tiers of exams with seperate levels within them, and different software versions within those. I'm not sure how different each software version is from each other, but apparently enough to warrant a different exam. The Enterprise Admin cert is probably more demonstrative of knowledge, skills, and abilities than the desktop associate. The Skills Measured though, are intimidating to me.  As to you your question about whether work experience is enough versus having a certification or coursework. GIS is a pretty wide-ranging field. For some people, GIS is data intensive, and includes geocoding dynamic web content or conducting heavy geoprocessing stuff. Other people just make maps. If your job title is ""research assistant"" or ""Electrical Designer"" something that's not GIS Analyst, etc; then it's hard to convey your experience. Maybe the new GISC exam will be better at certifying knowledge that's not platform-dependent."

I do mostly geometric network analysis, drafting, and data versioning.  All 94 questions were multiple choice. Some only had one answer, some had 2 or 3.

gis,3ancsd,rakelllama,2,Mon Jun 22 00:06:10 2015 UTC,Do you think that having a standardized test for GIS skills is a good way to demonstrate your GIS skills? It sounds to me like you must be pretty proficient in the actual program. Did the test ask questions that you felt would really demonstrate a working users knowledge of the program and its applications? I'm pretty surprised there weren't exercises as that's how I would think skills could be practically tested.
gis,3ancsd,anthropwn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"A standardized test is probably a good way to measure some skills with respect to a specific GIS platform. The ESRI Desktop Associate certification specifically does that. For example, there were some multiple choice questions that asked you to evaluate some examples of Visual Basic field calculator logic. Those were good questions, a competent ESRI user should be able to get those correct. I'd never know if I did, because of the feedback issue, but there you go. Does QGIS or MapInfo use VB? I don't know. Exercises would be tough, because then you'd have to have ArcGIS on the testing machine and that would probably get all fucked up. The testing people acted like they had never heard of the test I was taking. I guess they do mostly  CompTIA certs.  Maybe they tried to avoid exercises because there are always multiple ways to accomplish any one task, but also it would take a long time and Pearson VUE doesn't administer tests that way. By the way, the test is administered in a place you have to go and sign up for. It's like the GREs, you have to go and put all of your belongings into a locker and you are monitored while you take it. I think that's just because its an IT test-taking infrastructure that already exists and they had to comply with that testing style."
gis,3ancsd,rakelllama,2,Mon Jun 22 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way, because I totally don't mean it that way, but you're the first person I've ever heard of to not pass one of these.  Esri has faced a great deal of criticism in the industry over these exams and the fact that they don't publish scores, etc., so maybe you're getting caught in a 'crack-down' period right now.  It was sort of a running joke that Esri's exams were just a pay-to-play deal...send your money, get your certificate, which explains why so many of the questions are so ridiculous and unclear....it gives them a legal 'out' if it was ever challenged.  Honestly, I'm shocked that this happened to you.  Out of curiousty, did you feel like you didn't know a lot of the answers?"

But if you had told me that a passing score is 90% or better (purely speculative by the way), I'd say ""well, maybe I didn't pass because some of those questions I just didn't know or prepare for.

I've never been able to come up with anybody else online or in real life who can say they failed it.  Maybe Esri is stepping up their game on these now that GISCI is going to have a competency exam.

Like I mentioned in another comment, the questions felt very proprietary, as they were really testing how well you know your way around ArcGIS, not how well you understand the concepts of GIS. So if you don't use a set of tools a lot because it's not the type of work you do, there's a potential large bunch of questions you could miss."

If you want to go a little further, I would suggest the use of domains and subtypes in the geodatabase for such things as drop down menus. From there, you would publish to ArcGIS online and make the feature service editable and add it to a web map. If you potentially will have many users editing the map, you can enable editor tracking to see what users edited the map.

These three are the basics of web design and development. It's pointless to know HTML without JavaScript. Luckily, HTML and CSS are really straight forward.  In a GIS context, learn the basics of HTML+CSS, then move to JavaScript, and then mapping API's (basically toolkits) like OpenLayers and leaflet.  Python, as other have stated, is used to automize GIS tasks almost exclusively on software like ArcGIS and QGIS.  Outside of GIS, python is often suggested as the first programming/scripting language you should learn because of it's relative simplicity, object-orientation, and broad applications.

General Haversine Paper  Virtues of the Haversine - Sky and Telescope 1984  Very well done video on the haversine calculation as well as explaination on determining bearing.

The rounded triangle on wikipedia threw me off.   Spherical Geometry - 1m48s Graphic  I think I understand what I'm trying to calculate a lot better than before I came here. I could copy off formulas, and plug in numbers but I needed a conceptual understanding of WHAT I was calculating exactly, and HOW it works so that I can better implement it.

gis,3ah0wc,flippmoke,4,Sat Jun 20 05:22:51 2015 UTC,"First off totally confused what you are trying to do with PostGIS and mapbox. I assumed at first reading you were using Mapbox Studio? So giving you instructions somewhat to do that!  Some notes, I noticed my machine had its process ping out at about 4 GB of memory used by studio during this process, and it pretty much ate all my CPU when uploading tiles (see below). However, I haven't had any crashes. The shapefile was a little over half a GB in size, so thats not bad.  Okay so what I did:  First - get Mapbox Studio here.  Follow the steps here with the quickstart to get an idea of what you are doing. You are going to first load data into studio (just load the shapefile!), select the layers where you want tiles, then upload them to Mapbox (if you have an account).   Some notes on what I did:   Once I loaded the shapefile into Mapbox Studio, I clicked Settings and made the minzoom 16 and the maxzoom 16. This data is far too detailed to be useful at lower zoom levels, and we want to limit how much data has to be uploaded!  In the Settings after configuring my data source all how I wanted it, I hit Upload to Mapbox. This step will take some time! This is a large set of data so go grab a beer while you wait or coffee if thats your thing.   Alright so now after about 30 minutes, the cookies tiles are done. This is very dense data so it grinded away at ~1 tile/sec for a long time. (I write the code that does a lot of this process and I can tell you there is room for improvement on performance, we are working on making it faster!)sorry  Now its time to put on the icing styles! Will update with another post in a bit once I get to that."

Red is before 1900 to after 2000 in dark green.   Behold the power of Mapbox Studio and a little time. (think about how you could actually make something much prettier then this.)

gis,3ah0wc,Bubo_scandiacus,2,Sat Jun 20 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"Well I appreciate all of the help so far. To clear things up I downloaded the .zip files and put them into a folder, then using command prompt I put them into my spatial database I created with Postgres and then used mapbox studio to load in with postgis. I was also just wondering, is it supposed to freeze up like that though? What I'm worried about is that I won't be able to use any buildings data because those tend to be the biggest for any city. Also, would buying a special membership fix the problem since it gives more space? Thanks again for all the help."
gis,3ah0wc,flippmoke,2,Sat Jun 20 07:09:37 2015 UTC,"You don't have to put the shapefile into PostGIS, you can simply load it directly into Mapbox Studio. See my examples above.

Duncan Golicher has a nice tutorial about how to import rasters into PostgreSQL, you might have seen it already.  Tiles:   Critical This is the number of pixels per tile (so 10×10 is ten pixels by ten for each tile, 1000×1000 produces very large tiles) Understanding this is the key to everything. Providing the tile size is not exceptionally small (< 5 x 5) loading a raster with the -R flag will run through in seconds rather than minutes, even for large layers, so the process can be very easily repeated (up arrow in the terminal) if adjustments to the tile size are needed. In some cases different tile sizes are needed to optimise the speed of queries   This command creates 1000 x 1000 pixel tiles...  -t 1000×1000  Duncan explains that tiles don't have to be square, rectangles might be more efficient.  And then there are image pyramids, where lower resolution previews are loaded and displayed in QGIS depending on the zoom level...  -l 4  It's advisable to tweak the parameters to your needs.

The rendering time is not as snappy as I'd expect, but it is acceptable. I will read further on the -l parameter to use it properly. Thank you for the help.  Incidentally, in importing the dem.img file as the dem100 table another raster table was created called ""o_4_dem100"". When I import it as a layer in QGIS, it has a value range of between 201 to 524, while the dem100 layer has a range of 36 to 524. Am I right in assuming that this extra table is the pyramid table that has a narrower value range as a result of being aggregated to a lower resolution?"

gis,3a6604,Maaronweber,2,Wed Jun 17 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"Excited to see what the ""whole stack"" is going to look like. Can you speak to any of that?"
gis,3a6604,Maaronweber,6,Wed Jun 17 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"We already have a ""whole stack"", so lets first describe what you can do with Mapbox and its products currently, then I will talk some about where we are headed.  Starting off we have the ability to host a basemap for you (of your design or some basic ones that we have designed). The basemap is like that of google maps, so we charge for useage per Mapview which is 15 tiles loaded on your screen. This how we make our money, much like how Google Maps API does the same. Our pricing plan is here.  The basemap we currently offer is a constantly updating version of Openstreetmap that is updated every 5 minutes. We have a large data team that constantly is working to improve Openstreetmap. This is unique just like the fact that most of our code opensource, we are commiting our data back openly to the global community.  What makes us different is that we also allow you to upload your own data and styles. Data can be uploaded two ways. The first and most simple is that you can upload using Mapbox Studio, which is a style editor and data visualizer running locally on your computer (a mini stack) somewhat. Mapbox Studio works by having us send you vector tiles of the data you have uploaded to our site.  Vector tiles are created either in studio and uploaded for us to host and manage.  The other way to upload data is directly using our Upload API. This allows you to send things like shapefiles, tiffs, etc. to us and we will cut up the data and host it. This is more of a programatic way to upload data.  Finally we allow you to host custom styles, the style can be a combination of different data sources, that we combine into a vector tile for you. This means you can put your LIDAR point data on top of a basemap quickly and have it hosted.  Finally, we provide tools to make it easy for you to view this either in a browser or on a mobile device. The great part is a lot of this is GL (Graphic Card) driven meaning that you can do all sorts of neat things as this technology grows. Here on our examples there is a small map where you will not there are not distinct zoom levels but the data seamlessly transitions. This makes the look and feel of the basemap + your data have a really professional look and appearance, with out having to worry about hosting and managing all the data!  I want you to make sure you know that this is all still YOUR DATA and YOUR STYLES. We do not claim any ownership over them despite them being hosted on our servers.   Other things that are really cool that we offer:   We have an ever improving geocoder that is integrated in our stack We provide a directions API much like Google Maps etc We provide the ability for you to host your entire stack on your own in Amazon (our product called Atlas), if you wanted to manage it all We provide terrain elevation data globally!   So what else is coming?  Some of this is you will have to wait and see, but I can promise you that over time we make our tools easier to use and have improved data editing features much like you would see in a traditional GIS application. If you haven't seen how the iD editor works on http://www.openstreetmap.org/ you should see that and imagine something far more powerful. We have shown some of its features on our blog, but imagine a photoshop like map editor.   Our goal is to make web maps EASY, something that doesn't take a whole team of programmers, designers, and years of experience to accomplish.  If you haven't seen some of the stuff we have allowed people to do with drones you should!"

I was wondering if you folks were going to move into the desktop GIS space. Sounds like you are staying with web-maps.  And a sorta related, sorta separate question related to OSM... Is that data available on its own for download, i.e. could I download a set of streets for say, Oregon and then modify that data with some extra attributes I need (well, that a public agency needs)? I'm always looking for good street center-line data (and would love to get away from ""BillyBilly"" and other $$ solutions), but have little experience with OSM. I have heard the chat about licensing issues w/OSM, but I guess I'm just not clear about how that all works."

You can certainly take the OSM data and do what you want with it internally.

We build tools for programmers more then anything right now, but that doesn't mean it is necessarily hard. We want to empower companies to move faster on making their own tools. It is somewhat like AWS vs hosting your own servers. We are less just software and more of a service.   Desktop GIS services are more about editing, managing, and storing data rather then serving it and displaying it in a manner that is useful to non GIS individuals.   There are some licensing issues right now with people who use OSM. It is something that the community talks about quite often. Not an expert on those problems.

gis,3a4f0h,Shrood,28,Wed Jun 17 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. Which is a really fancy way of saying a GIS swiss army knife. It is very nice for several reasons:   It supports rasters and geometries (points, lines, polygons). It implements lots of very common geospatial operations (unions, intersections, joins, clipping, reprojection, rasterization, contouring, etc.) It supports a VERY large number of different drivers ( data formats for rasters and data formats for geometries ) It supports almost any hardware It supports many old operating systems / compilers (which is important for some people) It requires very low amounts of memory   GDAL started as a library just for rasters, so you will see many mentions to OGR, this was the geometry operations part of the library but as GDAL is heading towards 2.0 its becoming more one core library.  GDAL is written in C++, but has many other languages that bind to the resulting binaries it builds. This includes:   Java C Python Javascript R PHP Rust C# Perl  TCL   It also includes a lot of command line utilities that many people will mention and use as they are quite powerful. These are listed here and here.   If you have any questions on GDAL, the community is pretty friendly and the best way is probably on the dev mailing list. Additionally, if you have any questions feel free to ask me as I have worked in the GDAL code.  Shameless promotion: GDAL is headed up development by Even Rouault who has his own company called Spatialys. If you ever need help in Open Source as a contractor or want pay him to add focus on GDAL please do. The guy heads up this amazing project and does tons of stuff for free. He is also a REALLY nice guy and patiently will help almost anyone. He pours his heart into this library that is a foundation for so many pieces of software."

The typical user cannot really ""use"" GDAL alone (programmers nothwithstanding).  GDAL comes with tools that allow you to use GDAL in command-line, but more importantly, GDAL is running 'underneath the hood' of many GIS software packages.   Rgdal, is I understand is, the the form of gdal designed for use in R   I've never used it, but I would imagine that RGDAL was not a ""form of GDAL,"" but rather a piece of software that creates an interface between GDAL and R..

gis,3a5rpa,cmartin616,7,Wed Jun 17 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of custom geocoding.  I'm talking 450,000 unique records a week, if not more.  Here are some of the issues I can foresee...   Check your addresses.  You are finding your locality by zip code, so here is how the process works:   Address - 123 Main St Seattle WA 98501 Geocoder sees zip code - 98501 Is there a match?  Yes - 98501 matches to Olympia, WA  (oops, we wanted Seattle!) Is there a Main St in Olympia? - Yes Is there a 123 on Main St in Olympia? - No, numbers start at 1200 Return partial match - 'Main St, Olympia, WA 98501'  So you lost your geocode at step 3 because it selected the wrong locality.  This will result in an (incorrect) partial match of Main St, Olympia, WA.  My guess is more of your zip codes are incorrect rather than bad addresses. I'd suggest trying to parse out the city/state from your address into a address, city, state, zip look up.  This lets the above process re-start and try Seattle, WA (with no zip code) and it will likely find 123 Main St.  If it still doesn't, your address is wrong. There is not a good way to script these as scripting is automation.  You don't want to automate this process.  It requires manual interaction to verify these addresses.  You need a level of human interaction/adaptation that is simply not reasonable to coerce Python into doing. Your efforts would be best spent on data clean up rather than trying to manipulate the geocoding process into returning incorrect or partial matches.   Feel free to ask for clarification or more info on anything I mentioned!"

In my example though, the hatching was for print and has no business being brought in to GIS. The 500 tiny disconnected polygon thing could be a kind of copy protection mechanism, so that others don't copy and botch the engineer's drawing, thus opening the engineer to liability; I've heard of worse. In any event, joining those lines in CAD is a relatively trivial task.   P.S. - My biggest gripe in bringing CAD drawings into ArcGIS is that ESRI treats every polygon as one layer, every point as one layer, and every line as one layer. If ArcGIS just treated each AutoCAD layer as a separate set of point, line, and polygon layers with the original layer names and descriptions then my life would be a bit easier."

gis,3a21qz,zip117,3,Sat Jun 20 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"A shape file is still a shape file in CAD (civil 3d specifically) and can be referenced into the CAD environment and queried to extract data (ie polylines) and apply attributes to the entity (ie generate the polylines and apply the elevation attribute to the elevation property of the polyline). They behave like no other entity that I have played with in CAD and so I'm really not certain that trying to explain them as in reference to anything else would work. They are not a block, they are not an xref, they are maybe kinda like a data link??? But not really.   A layer in CAD is just a bucket to dump data and it is entirely up to the user how or why they do that, but generally it is pertaining to one aspect of a drawing. Such as all underground water lines may go on the W-UG layer, while all the surface features of the water line may go on the W-AG layer. Or maybe the user decides to consolidate all water line features to a single layer named W. There are global attributes/properties that can be assigned to all entities on a later, such as color or linetype generation. The point in the end being only, visual control. What layers are seen through what viewports and how they look for final product. There is a more hidden layer tool used for mapping that I believe is more akin to what you are accustomed to in esri programs (though I am not certain). Look up the Map workspace (mapwspace at command prompt). It's used for draw order layer control and georeferncing tools."

gis,39zdnf,jb2824,6,Tue Jun 16 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"Shapefiles are fairly antiquated in the industry by people who actually deal with spatial data.  Unfortunately their very memorable name is still stuck firmly in the collective vocabulary of people who work with GIS people but not with GIS itself.  In my experience, upper management folks are very used to just saying things like ""just package up a couple of shapefiles and send it to the client"".  ""Shapefile"" is just a very easy and non-intimidating word, it is a file of shapes.  I think that when you say ""geodatabase"", it sounds very complex and arcane, especially to those who use computers mostly for checking email and making word documents."
gis,39zdnf,jb2824,4,Tue Jun 16 06:05:57 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: SQL Server database with spatial column.  I think you've demonstrated a weakness in a lot of GIS education. I, too learned mostly with ESRI products and, while we discussed geodatabases in class and read about them, we did very little work with them, not nearly enough to understand what the point of them really was. Basically, everything I did in college made me think geodatabases were pointless and annoying. That's a problem. When you start dealing with really large, complex datasets with lots of attributes, you really need the power of a database.   For me, right now, that's rapidly becoming SQL. I use SQL Server and I can use the management studio tools to do all sorts of transformations and joins that would kill ArcMap, or simply be hard to do with its interface. Then I connect directly to the SQL database. If I'm viewing data or making a map in ArcMap I'll create a spatial column in the SQL database and connect to it to display. It's much faster to connect to SQL Server to display a million points with 20 attributes than to try to use a shapefile.   There are a lot of other spatial functions in SQL now that we're beginning to use to replace ESRI functions as well. And if I build a web map, I can write a webservice to connect to the database and pull out only the spatial data I need, in the format I need to display it. You have to know how to code your own webservices to take advantage of that kind of detail, but it can be well worth it, depending on your data and application."

So, for some tasks shapefiles are best.   However, if I am building an in-house repository, or consolidating features tables and surfaces in a project, or working with no direction then using a database format that has increased functionality is best.

What are the drawbacks of using shapefiles (vs whatever your preferred format is)?   Shapefiles must have at a minimum, 3 files, the .shp, .dbf, and .shx. It's harder to keep track of them. I believe they also have size limitations.   What sort of storage format do you find most useful to general GIS work, especially point/line/poly geometries?   I prefer to use geodatabases. They encapsulate all of the files that a shapefile has (and most other files) into one gdb (basically a zip folder). Geodatabases can have builtin topology, network data sets, and all sorts of other things that you can't necessarily do with shapefiles. There are times where I have to export to a shapefile if I want to use a third party library or script. It's not a big deal though. I believe the file-geodatabase is propriety but the personal geodatabase uses microsoft access as the backend. Enterprise databases can be run from SQL server, Postgres, and other common RDBMS.    What should I look at or for to learn more about this?   ESRI has lots of good documentation   What is a shapefile Shapefile extensions What is a geodatabase?

My main concern was dealing with coordinates and then adding layers of data on top (state/national boundaries, cities, etc...)  I do realize that I need to always be cautious of scale when planning, and not to be too ambitious, and I think you're right.  Perhaps GIS may be a bit overboard.

From the ethics training and documents I've signed it was very clear that data at this fine of a level can't be disseminated publicly.

Local storage is always going to be fastest because you're not leaving the box to access or create data. That's not to say you can't get the same outcome using network storage, you'd just need a network administrator that can ensure that elusive bottleneck is minimized, relevant ports are open, and bandwidth is adequate."
gis,39g554,_fuggis,2,Thu Jun 11 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"You do not have to do do all your spatial operations on the browser/client-side, but there are some advantages to doing so. ESRI does all of its processing server side, but there are many Opensource alternatives to it as well if you don't want to use them. If you want a full drop in stack to replace ESRI yourself there is OpenGeoSuite that is supported by http://boundlessgeo.com/ .   If you wanted to handle your own GIS operations internally there are lots of smaller libraries you can use to operations. From the basic set of operations you described it sounds like you could still use Leaflet, but send data to the client that is stored in PostGIS and have it do GIS operations prior to sending it to Leaflet.  As far as your issues you are experiencing with Turf, my suggestions would be to open an issue on the Github for Turf, I am sure someone will be easily able to help you with some ideas.   OpenLayers is somewhat of a beast, compared to the simplicity of Leaflet in my opinion."

PostGIS includes a ton of extra functionality that is above and beyond this spec.  As /u/korlyth mentions, this includes the ability to transform between projections.

Leaflet allows a lot more flexibility and it's what I use when I'm doing map stuff because I tend to want to integrate it with Angular or D3 or other stuff like that. I don't need to do a ton of processing but the stuff I do tends to be clientside if I can't just do it beforehand and just pull from a static GeoJSON. For heavier processing I can usually get the data I need from a query against one of our ArcGIS REST servers and then I'll just use the returned JSON in Leaflet. This is a popular option because the GIS people can do what they need to with ESRI and I can still make stuff with Leaflet. I've never had this happen outside of just using it for fun (our needs are generally met well before we get to this point), but PostGIS should do everything you need it to if you need to do stuff serverside while staying open source. Also you can run Node.js on the backend and do serverside processing. I haven't used TurfJS but I've only heard good things. I just tend to not use it because if the data needs major GIS processing there's enough data in the dataset that I shouldn't be loading it clientside anyways. At least in my case.  Also, if you post your Leaflet code in JSFiddle I'm sure between all of the people in this subreddit we can figure out the issue."

It is important to understand that there is a distinction between actual, traveled traffic data (like Google has) and extrapolated traffic data (like the DOT has).    Any given DOT, especially in the larger, more rural non-coastal states, has a fairly limited sample set used to estimate ADT for the entire managed roadway network.  It is based on a small handful of traffic counters placed at a given location for a few days and then moved someplace else.  This, of course, cannot capture everything along the entire network and, more importantly, cannot account for temporary spikes or reductions in traffic at that location (being used as a detour, a special event happening at that location, etc.).  DOT data has two purposes.  The first is to fulfill Federal reporting requirements.  The second is for fairly rough wear estimates on pavement surfaces along with traffic flow analysis.  The 'big boys' doing the real-time stuff are using, for the most part, cell phone data.  Companies like Here/Navteq and a few others compile that data and then make a whole bunch of money selling it.  The datasets are massive, but it's real-time, covers basically the entire network, and is gathered for extended amounts of time.    In other words, you can get the DOT data for free but understand its limitations.  The 'good' data will cost you."

This data is only available at a few locations but more sites are always being added.

So I map geological properties a decent amount, both in Arc and in some industry-specific programs, but I also map all sorts of production data, more operational data (like pipelines or certain well characteristics that might affect production), and occasionally more business-related maps (like index maps or maps for publications for our investors).   Outside of mapping, it's a lot of data management. I set up and maintain our geological databases, the filing system (both digital and physical) for our raw files, and help troubleshoot software issues/offer technical assistance. I'm also pulled in on a lot of fun larger projects to do spatial data work. Because I have a geology background, I also do or help with actual geological work.

Dress well, be prepared, know the company, be nice (to EVERYBODY you encounter), try to be a little memorable.   As far as things companies look for specifically for jobs like this, mostly it's just computer skill. If you haven't used the software the job listing requests, emphasize how quickly you learn (with good, concise examples) or your proficiency with certain other softwares that would help you learn. The desire and willingness to learn new things is also really important for all jobs. Microsoft office products are pretty universal, so know how to use them, especially Excel and Powerpoint. Be an excel wizard.   You know some GIS, which is awesome. If you get an interview, bring a portfolio of work. Whole projects help too - I brought selected slides from my undergraduate thesis defense - which not only shows you know software, but can work through something start to finish and present on it.   Don't over-embellish aesthetically (specifically your resume), this industry is still a little old school. Neat, easy-to-read, and a little different are good. Don't put grades on your resume, just GPA is fine. Listing relevant coursework is also fine for somebody just coming out of college, but list in groups by subject. If you'd like me to help more with your resume I'd be more than happy to, too, just send me a pm.  If you're applying to jobs, especially for a ""lower"" position like analyst (don't get me started on this), being local is really helpful. They're not going to fly you out for an interview in this environment. If you're not in an area with oil companies but are willing to move let me know, there are definitely options.  When you find a listing you like and apply, email the HR contact, which is usually listed on the first page you get to to search for jobs. Being a squeaky wheel isn't a bad thing, and sometimes applications do get kind of lost. Follow up later if you haven't heard back. Most importantly, don't get discouraged if you don't hear back from a lot of companies.   A little end note, don't waste your time with websites like Monster. Get your linkedin up to snuff and make sure your title line (under your name) reflects that you're looking for a specific job. Use lots of relevant keyword everywhere so you're easily findable in bot searches. Indeed is a pretty decent job listing site, though, and I think it can connect to your linkedin. There's also OilPro, which is industry-specific, but I haven't really used it much.  Sorry again this was long and I hope it wasn't too disorganized.

gis,398j28,thedougied,9,Wed Jun 10 00:54:23 2015 UTC,"I know that I'm super interested in it and it's the first thing I've found in six years that I'm passionate enough about to go back to school for, and that my goals are to be employed in a job that challenges me more than retail does on daily basis   That's probably a better reason than most of us have.   I got into it because 18 year old hippie-me wanted to be a park ranger.   I went to Virginia Tech because that's what the upper-middle does, and enrolled in a major called ""Natural Resources Recreation."" Me and everyone around me knew it was me just being a slacker like always.   Natural Resources Recreation led to  changing my major to Forestry, which uses a lot of GIS tools and data to do forest inventory, wildfire mitigation, etc. and I thought ""hey that's pretty neat,"" and then I got good at that stuff and switched to ""Environmental Resources Management"" which is exactly what it sounds like and used a ton of applied GIS.  For those keeping score, that's 3 majors so far.  Eventually I earned myself the high honor of academic probation (classic too much partying, not enough studying), and had to decide if I really wanted to be in college or not.  It was then that I realized that the only thing I really enjoyed academically was the GIS stuff, specifically. Sure, I liked forestry and resource management, but I loved GIS.  So, I changed majors a fourth and final time to ""Geospatial & Environmental Analysis"" and stayed on the Dean's List every semester after.  After college, I headed up to the DC area to work, because I couldn't find a job elsewhere, and DC + GIS meant government contracting.   After a stint at FEMA building geoprocessing models for response & recovery for wildfires and hurricanes and such, I got in to GIS consulting, which meant frequent new clients, new work, new projects - it was invigorating.   I did that for 8 years or so and by the end, I wasn't the guy doing the work any more - I was the guy talking to clients and figuring out what their actual need was (oftentimes different from what they thought they needed), designing a solution for them, taking it back to the technical guys and having them actually implement / design / build it. If you're that guy, you have the best information on who's available when, what their skillsets are, what their rate is, and so on, and before you know it, you're a project manager.   Most GIS guys I know never want to become a PM because they enjoy the technical work so much, or software development, finding a new way to make something even better, and so on. PMs are miserable bean-counters, right?  My next and current job was just that - GIS project manager. Goodbye Magellan, hello Scrooge!  Dirty little secret - it's really fun. Having the technical knowhow to design something on the fly with a client - you know, just a whiteboard drawing, then coming home and having your team take your hare-brained idea and actually build it? Then the client loves it because it solves their problem, your team loves it because it was fun to build something new, and you get to be right in the middle of that. That's my endorsement for working towards being a PM or at least a leader in your GIS career - it gets really fun. Sure, you have to do all the boring stuff too, but every job, heck, everything has the light and the dark side.   So, from park ranger to managing the budget, you can have a lot of fun with GIS - we can use it to solve problems in a way that makes a lot of sense (spatially! hey, everything's somewhere), is intuitive to humans, easy to customize, and wows people. You can become a computer scientist and write code, you can exercise your inner graphic designer as a cartographer, you can become a mathematician and dive into the statistics of it all, you can do whatever you want with it. I look forward to going to work every day because I know that what we're doing is, to use technical terms, useful, cool, and fun.   Welcome aboard!  edit: what are my career goals? I'd say to build a team where everyone's ultra sharp and makes good stuff, and have the market see us as high-end option - for when simply getting the work done isn't good enough - a dream team of hyper-capable devs and analysts who can make, how do you say, ""next level shit!"""

So, to do what I did with it - not that it's illustrious (hey everybody, we got a very important middle manager over here!) is really more of a personality thing than anything else.   I like to talk, find common ground, talk some more, listen, ""be interested, not interesting,"" all that. I'm not handsome or charismatic, I'm just very good in a room and very good on my feet talking to people, and that's something that's more who you are than what you are. So, to be a biz dev person or a client-man, or leader of your team, I feel like much of that is baked-in, nature rather than nurture.   Most GIS devs I know, for example, are uncomfortable with the idea of being the schmoozer-bullshitter-manager-seller because the very traits that make them great at writing software (logic, intelligence, black and white) make them by definition not great at schmoozing. In English, devs don't suffer fools, and a people person like me lacks the structure to be good at building things.   Look in the mirror and figure out if, 10 years from now, you want to be talking, writing code, making maps, building websites, analyzing data or what.   Your 10 year plan should not be limited by your current prospects.  Think of what you like, broadly, and what you're good at, broadly, even if it has nothing to do with GIS.   I know now that GIS is tertiary to 1) leadership and 2) running my mouth.   In my grand scheme - but it took ten years. If you want to serve yourself and your career the best, FORGET SPECIFICS, like ""should I learn to write code, or run servers or what?""  You're you and you're only going to fulfill your total potential when you are A) honest with yourself about who and what you are and B) make choices to put yourself in spots to grow.

As part of my geography degree, I also had to take a few GIS courses. That's where I absolutely fell in love with it.

I'm not sure how things work in other countries, but when you learn GIS at a university, they always start students with ArcGIS. It's part of the capitalist-consumerist lifestyle here, whether you like it or not. ESRI sells discounted packages of ArcGIS to high education and research institutions, and schools like it because they set it all up for you, it's more streamlined than any open-source software, and people know the name. It also is a textbook/software thing. Every GIS class we sign up for, we usually have to buy some ESRI Press tutorial textbooks, yada yada yada. Then, at the end of college, when you're all comfortable with ESRI, you start realizing that it's not the only program out there. You are kind of worried, but you realize you can still get a job just knowing ESRI products, so why bother? You tinker with OSM or whatever but that's about it. Then once you're a professional GIS person working in the US, you start to stagnate and the incentive to learn open-source becomes less and less, unless you're forced to. Most GIS companies here just buy ESRI too, it's easier, like buying Microsoft Office, they just want the streamlined packages.  So to answer your question, the reason you only get about 30% US visitors is probably because while we crank out probably a large percentage of GIS users in the world, it takes a more adventurous/curious GIS user in the US to have an interest in open-source solutions. That's why you're still getting some interest but not a ton. At work and school it's usually ESRI. Plus people seem to want to send their staff to the ESRI UC here, and the push for ESRI certifications for job openings is growing too.  My opinion? Eh.

A lot of crashes at one intersection does not mean that the next intersection, or one close by, will have a higher probability of incidents (after normalized for traffic density of course!)"

And also, even taking into account some sort of normalisation, population, traffic density or otherwise.

Specifically, in the scenario I described above, am I right to express that a cell with a value of 5 has a density of 5 crimes per km2. I completely value the argument of normalisation against raw numbers.

There had been rumors that AOL might be shuttering MapQuest given the elimination of two key positions from the team.    Any idea what happened here?
gis,39677i,bcthecat,2,Thu Jun 11 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they chose to use Mapbox was that we allowed them to use their own data, and all our infrastructure to deal with hosting the maps. At Mapbox we are making building blocks so that individuals can style and display their own data. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to make and display their data.  Mapquest did use Mapnik, and some of their developers have been very helpful in its development. Although the lead developers and BDFL of Mapnik (Artem) work at Mapbox, it is still very much an community driven project. We spend time helping foster the development of tools around and in Mapnik that do not directly aid a mission at Mapbox. Some of the developers that no longer work at Mapquest are still helping with Mapnik (they are really good developers as well!).   I have no idea on AOLs plans for Mapquest."

gis,397wxz,flippmoke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:41:31 2015 UTC,Thanks. I kind of suspect that ArcPad and/or Windows is freaking out over the size of the file. I'm pursuing a compressed TIFF now...
gis,397wxz,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 10 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"Not an ESRI user, but know data formats very well, and have lots of experience writing code for reading/writing raster formats in software.   So I have ZERO idea how ESRI deals with the reading of large rasters internally. Maybe an ESRI software engineer could explain more what they do but I want to explain what happens when you read in a raster.   Step 1: Determine what part of the Raster to Load Step 2: Decompress (If Compressed) Step 3: Load into system memory (typically a buffer)   Okay, so some raster readers, like the TIFF reader I wrote for mapnik, will read in the entire file even if you do not need it all. This is done because it makes it quicker to read and operate on the entire raster.   Other raster readers, like that in GDAL, do something different and more complex. They load sections of the raster on demand and store them in a cache. This can be slower if you have enough memory because you are often forced to do operations like Interleaving) and decompression more then once. However, these allow for much less system memory to be used.   So I am here to say that if the first method, like currently used in Mapnik is done for any compressed format, you will still run out of memory, no matter how well you compress it. I heard that ESRI at one time was using some parts of GDAL to read some formats, I have no idea if they still do this. We have a plugin in Mapnik to use GDAL just for this purpose!   So your options are limited here perhaps. The best options you might have is experimenting with perhaps using a smaller color space. If you are already using RGBA8 (1 byte for each color), then you won't be able to compress it much more but perhaps that JPEG 2000 file is RGBA16 or higher."
gis,397wxz,Awataren,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"Interlacing (bitmaps):       Interlacing (also known as interleaving) is a method of encoding a bitmap image such that a person who has partially received it sees a degraded copy of the entire image. When communicating over a slow communications link, this is often preferable to seeing a perfectly clear copy of one part of the image, as it helps the viewer decide more quickly whether to abort or continue the transmission.  Interlacing is supported by the following formats, where it is optional:   GIF interlacing stores the lines in the order 0, 8, 16, ...(8n), 4, 12, ...(8n+4), 2, 6, 10, 14, ...(4n+2), 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...(2n+1). PNG uses the Adam7 algorithm, which interlaces in both the vertical and horizontal direction. TGA uses two optional interlacing algorithms, two-way: 0, 2, 4, ...(2n), 1, 3, ...(2n+1) and four-way: 0, 4, 8, ...(4n), 1, 5, ...(4n+1), 2, 6, ...(4n+2), 3, 7, ...(4n+3). JPEG, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR (actually using a frequency decomposition hierarchy rather than interlacing of pixel values) PGF (also using a frequency decomposition)   Interlacing is a form of incremental decoding, because the image can be loaded incrementally. Another form of incremental decoding is progressive scan. In progressive scan the loaded image is decoded line for line, so instead of becoming incrementally clearer it becomes incrementally larger. The main difference between the interlace concept in bitmaps and in video is that even progressive bitmaps can be loaded over multiple frames.  For example: Interlaced GIF is a GIF image that seems to arrive on your display like an image coming through a slowly opening Venetian blind. A fuzzy outline of an image is gradually replaced by seven successive waves of bit streams that fill in the missing lines until the image arrives at its full resolution.  Interlaced graphics were once widely used in web design and before that in the distribution of graphics files over bulletin board systems and other low-speed communications methods. The practice is much less common today, as common broadband internet connections allow most images to be downloaded to the user's screen nearly instantaneously, and interlacing is usually an inefficient method of encoding images. [citation needed]  Interlacing has been criticized because it may not be clear to viewers when the image has finished rendering, unlike non-interlaced rendering, where progress is apparent (remaining data appears as blank).

gis,38y73u,NORTHAMERICAN_SCUM,3,Mon Jun 8 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about an idea lately.  It's not a coherent one..  and it may not be in the spirit of the thread.  But it is an idea.  but it is based on the idea having a firm of people -- 20, 100, 1,000 -- I don't know.  They could share techniques, share data, or share work, but each individual would ""own"" the franchise rights for a given region, or be a representative for that region.  (An MSA, a county, a city, a state, some kind of geographic sub-unit based on population and/or area  and/or GDP.)     Work could be shared between regions, or not.  It would basically be an extremely decentralized company based on profit-sharing.  Or a large collection of freelancers that cooperated.  I'm not exactly sure how it would work.  But there would be value in (A)  each person being an expert in their local region's geography, geographic data, and market demands for GIS,  (B)  shared branding,  (C) having other members with specialized techniques and/or workflows."
gis,38y73u,tforward,3,Mon Jun 8 02:29:08 2015 UTC,Good in theory and you need to expand this out more. What if person in once productive region no longer has any work b/c of market changes. How does the group as a whole share work to help this individual.
gis,38y73u,NORTHAMERICAN_SCUM,2,Mon Jun 8 00:51:12 2015 UTC,"What if person in once productive region no longer has any work b/c of market changes. How does the group as a whole share work to help this individual.   So we'll say everyone in the firm is a Vice President, except for 1 ""President"" who is elected for 4-year terms.  And every region has 2 VP's:  a VP of Technology and a VP of Business.  (This is a bit like insurance and finance, where ""Vice Presidents"" grow on trees.)  And we'll use Colorado as an example ..     the Denver region alone would still have the potential to generate far more work than any VP team could do.  Neighboring regions would have the opposite problem. Western Nebraska or Cheyenne, Wyoming might have a persistent shortage of work.  So whomever was in Denver might naturally spend more time acquiring data, managing projects, and pushing out work to, say, neighboring regional teams in Nebraska, Wyoming, western Kansas,  or New Mexico.     Or...  to Milwaukee, or Shreveport, Western Australia, Liverpool, or Antwerp.  So you might have a 'firm' with 200 or 2,000 people,  broken up into regional 2-person teams. Some of these 2-person teams will spend more time generating business and/or managing 'outsourced' projects,  while other 2-person teams will spend more time acquiring projects from other regions and/or advancing the business practice into lesser-established fields (small business, political campaign GIS, or agriculture, for example).  But there would be a clear division in one sense:  Each region would be responsible for the quality and availability of its local data.  That would be a core concept.  If VP in Denver sends Denver-related work to a VP in Montana, the VP in Montana can't be expected to acquire Denver data and vouch for its quality.  ""Farming out"" or ""Outsourcing"" work to other regions would need to be ""sanitized"" to a degree that someone in Miami could, if necessary, perform GIS work for Alaska without knowing anything about the nuances of Alaska's data.  Furthermore, there would need to be a great deal of ""sharing"" at play in terms of profit and/or wages, so there wouldn't be unreasonably large internal competition placed on having a high-value region.  The system wouldn't work well if everyone is fighting over ""franchise ownership"" of DC, Houston, and Denver.  The whole concept is intended to distribute profits/compensation among VP's."

I don't agree 100% with it all but it's the kinds of things that aren't really that big of a deal. The most important thing is use as much white space as possible. Balance is also very important. Your map doesn't have to take up the entire page. It's okay if it doesn't. If the other elements of the map fill up the white and balance the map that's fine. Definitely remove the word ""Legend"". That's rarely used. And your legend text on that size of a page shouldn't be larger than 12 pts.  And don't sweat the north arrow too much. I use that one all the time. It's not too extravagant and looks decent imo.   It can also be helpful to put your name, date and the project name (or path the project). I can't tell you how many times some one came up to me asking for a map I did 2 or 3 years ago.  Having the path / document name on there has been an immense help.    I took the liberty of rearranging the items on your map as an example of using as much white space as possible. (Just shopped moving items around and making the map larger)  http://i.imgur.com/06K67cZ.jpg  Aside from a lot of white space, the biggest problem I had with your map is the names of your layers.

You don't necessairly need to shade the city limit, as its a boarder you could just have no fill and a distinctive boarder and that would highlight the university more.  6.

Also, never name the legend ""legend."" Everyone knows what a legend is. Either no name at all, or name it something that explains what your data layers are showing. On that note name your layers so they tell the viewer what they are showing.

Missing your name, data sources, date, etc.  Check out colorbrewer2.org for some great color schemes.

Ideally your whole page is map, with cartographic elements like legend and whatnot integrated into the map. That can be somewhat tough, however.   The easist way to do it is to make your map engulf the entireity of the page except for an inch or so at top, for the title, and maybe 2 inches at the bottom, in which you can place your cartographic elements. I use this for rasters, mostly. If this doesn't make sense I can show you examples tomorrow. Anyway that's how I do it.  Your color scheme is decent. Also, never title your legend legend. Legends don't necessarily need titles at all. Also, play with the scale bar, you want it to be in sensible units, like 2 miles even or something. Also make there fewer divisions in the scale bar options page, that'll clean it up.  Simpler north arrows are generally better."

You are not texting here.  Avoid abbreviations if space allows.   I have no idea what the first item is. For polygons like buildings, avoid using black for the outline color. On smaller scale maps you wind up losing the inside color and all you see is black. The buildings wind up changing colors!  I use yellow for buildings with a light shade of orange for the outline. If the map is about San Marcos, why isn't the entire city visible? The scale bar is nonsensical. Always stretch it so it makes some easy to understand distance. For this,  use 1 mile.  This may sound overly critical and you may feel overwhelmed, but this is why people get paid to do GIS!  You really have to think of everything!"

In a professional environment you MUST always know what projection \system your data is in and you MUST actively manage them in ArcGIS. Not doing so will either immediately or eventually lead to embarrassing mistakes.  Your longitude probably has the wrong sign (+/-) and that's why it is showing up in the wrong place. Usually using the wrong projection only results in realitvely minor error.  Two other common errors is having your data frame projection set to something and not having a projection defined with your data and also incorrectly selecting projected\geographic.  Open a new map, don't set a projection, load your data, and select a geographic projection like wgs84. It should be about right at this point or your actual coordinates are wrong.

If you know your particular dataset is using lat/long, then those x/y coordinates should inherently be based off of a geographic coordinate system.  Now the only issue is to figure out what particular datum, or reference point, is used for your coordinates.  Almost always it's going to be WGS84 or NAD83.  But...here's the but....the discernible difference in location between coordinates in WGS84 and those in NAD83 is so very small that in the vast majority of gps datasets imported into commercial software it functionally doesn't exist.  But, you can ask the folks that gave you the data what they're using.  ArcGIS should be able to transform between multiple coordinate systems/multiple datasets real-time, so first look at your data frame coordinate and transformation settings and then look at the source data itself to make sure you're using the correct coordinate systems and that the data itself isn't bad."

It's also not that geographically spread, so I wouldn't think it would make much difference. As you say, it seems to me like after trying half a dozen likely projections, it should be at least coming close.   What I really can't figure out is that I have a map I made a while ago with similar data. Looking at the excel sheets, they have lat/long points in similar ranges. This other data displays perfectly fine. The new excel data still displays nowhere near, even when I put it in the same projection as the first excel set."

Let Arc add them back to the existing map so the exported dataset shows up in your map.  Right click on the dataset name in the table of contents pane and verify that the coordinate system is the selected geographic system (WGS84, etc.).  Close everything.  Open a new map and add your other data.  Now add the stand-alone shapefile you just created.  See if that works.  Also make double super certain that you KNOW the coordinate values are correct for the hemisphere you're in (negative vs. positive values) and that you're selecting the appropriate column for 'X' (longitude) and 'Y' (latitude)."

It gave me the window to choose x and y and projection system again, but didn't give me the right options.

If you're interested in dabbling in Pro, but don't want to make the break from 10.3 yet, here are some advantages I've found with Pro:   It doesn't eat up licenses from your license manager since it goes through your ArcGIS online organizational account.  This includes extensions like 3D Analyst/Spatial Analysis.  So you effectively double your license pool if that's a concern. It's a 64bit application, so geoprocessing tools have access to more memory.  This makes certain workflows much faster.  For example, just intersecting/clipping large datasets, they will all buffer to memory instead of being tiled.  I know there's a patch for 10.3 that offers 64 bit background processing, but it's buggy."

I've spent a fair amount of time going through ArcGIS Pro now, and I haven't found anything (yet) that I need for my introductory course that isn't in ArcGIS Pro - plus Pro has a lot of advantages over ArcMap (more intuitive UI, 64-bit, multithreading, I could go on).  Reading through this post: http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2015/02/06/analysis-geoprocessing-in-arcgis-pro-frequently-asked-questions/ it seems there is little reason to stick with ArcMap (the tools Pro doesn't have, it will soon, according to the post)."
gis,38pyxq,gismapography,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"Your points are valid.  However, I'd counter with a few others:   The blog post says in 'future releases'.  This will not be for quite some time and it will be incremental. Will you then move back to ArcMap/Catalog to teach intermediate or advanced analysis courses? Will you teach backward compatible Python (3.x in Pro, 2.x in ArcMap)? Most of the industry is using ArcMap, so they will have to learn it eventually.  I mean, I just worked with a client using ArcView 3.2 in their shop for their daily work.  Latest and greatest is awesome in academia or modern shops but that quickly gets stymied by budgets and other issues as soon as you hit the 'real world.' You need more than a ArcMap license for Pro.  You need an AGOL named used account to access the license.   Just things to consider!  End of the day, I think they should be taught in conjunction.  Exposing people to options and possibilities is way more powerful than teaching click patterns."

To explain a bit more, typically we've IDed 10-15 habitats in a 1500+ acre corridor, and we have 3-8 possible alternatives that cross that corridor.  We want to know which alternatives impact which habitats, and how much of each, and we want it all split out, and named correctly, and done without manual processing.

gis,38ix0j,cmartin616,2,Thu Jun 4 16:47:44 2015 UTC,Lots of new stuff but mostly you are missing out on the ability to publish directly to ArcGIS Online from ArcMap.  This will become critical as more and more content moves to AGOL.
gis,38ix0j,ladezudu,2,Thu Jun 4 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"But you need a subscription account to publish to AGOL. It consumes credits for ESRI to host your data. Publishing the services via your own servers will not consume credits. u/drewskey said that they're all desktop, no servers.    You can still consume services that people have published and made public on AGOL.   But it's ArcGIS, YMMV."
gis,38ix0j,cmartin616,3,Fri Jun 5 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"See, that is exactly where AGOL should be leveraged.  Speaking to your points:   Almost every business/corporation/non-profit/etc. license structure includes an account and credits. Hosting features consumes 2.4 credits per 10mb.   10mb is a lot of features 2.4 credits is ~$0.24/mo I would strongly recommend against hosting tiles as that is a completely different story.  Most organizations have no need to host custom basemaps or tiles.  If they do, Server is a cheaper long term option.  A server license is expensive, lots of locations don't have one, and AGOL is much cheaper for places with tight budgets. AGOL offers all the redundancy, fallback, etc. of Amazon instances that you don't have access to with ArcGIS Server unless you have someone very server architecture savvy on premises (or a consultant).  Again, expensive salary, equipment, etc. As OP said, all desktop, no server.  This is where AGOL shines.

I would suggest going to Meetup events to do some networking. Check out Geospatial Amateurs. Apparently there are some Maptime meetups going on now both in Boulder and Denver. If you are just starting out then make friends with professors and let them know you are looking for an internship or something to get your foot in the door. A lot of my friends from school are working for city or regional governments as their first ""real"" job.    Some others are: A. CompassData churns through a lot of recent graduates. I'm not a fan because their business model is to underpay those in need of work. They offered me a job that was less per hour than my student position at the university, for example. The upside is that you can leave after you get some experience and they are a Trimble dealer which will give you some expertise in field data collection. B. Digital Globe if you have experience with raster and image processing. At entry level with limited experience you may have to work 3rd shift but at least it won't interfere with class? C. Make friends and NETWORK. Work hard at that and you'll get something eventually. D. Try to make friends at oil companies. Doesn't float my boat but they are doing a lot of ""environmental"" work. Most companies need a lot of entry level help to perform basic analysis and make maps. Others need some field hands to do some remote work with GPS. Good luck!"

Otherwise, bring in a basemap, zoom to the location, and work off there.  Export to KML   How to export to KML with QGIS    Couple of notes:   This will not be a quick process unless you have a very small data set to create.  Data creation (or digitization) takes many, many hours.  It is the crux of a majority of GIS intern work because it is so tedious and time consuming. Why KML?  KML is terrible and difficult to work with once it is in KML format.  Most things convert to KML alright, most things don't convert from KML well (in my experience).   Edit - to answer your specific questions:  ""...its not very obvious how i could do this and there is not much online about it.""   Not true.  There are dozens of links here that will get you started.   do i create the whole KML floormap inside of QGIS?   You will not create anything in KML.  You will create vectors and export to KML.   do i create the floormap in some other program in some other format, importing it into QGIS to export as KML?   Create the data as a vector layer in QGIS and export it to KML.   i need to include feature data such as room names and room ids to polygons representing rooms, is this done when creating the vector floormap that is to be converted to KML, or can this be done in QGIS as part of the KML?   Don't work in KML.

It has allowed me to regularly refactor my code as my skills improve each time I want to change/update it. /r/dailyprogrammer  Learn the Esri JS API and Leaflet inside and out.   I've found them to be the most frequently used mapping libraries. /r/gis or pm me  Start making apps   submit them to challenges, including the many offered by Esri.

I was fortunate enough to run into some really amazing resources who helped me when I got stuck and answered all of my terrible/mundane questions.  Leverage these resources.  Ask questions on Reddit, StackOverflow, Esri's geonet, etc.  One thing that I think gets lost on a lot of people coming into this industry is you need to be able to learn and teach yourself.  You don't need to memorize obscure syntax but you should know what methods are available and how to call them.  The documentation is key (unless its Dojo's terrible docs).

My program allowed people to skate through if they wanted and they are mostly underemployed.  The individuals who sought out more (new tech, big data, new skills) are all pretty decently employed.  Oh, and as for your specific question, demonstrable skills will win over official education every time.  Having a BA/BS/MS/whatever shows you can be committed to a task but skills are necessary to be an asset to a company.

They're taking the best part of Windows 8 and merging them with Windows 7 again, and still innovating. Windows 8 was a mess (but I still overall like it) because it tried to split into two separate UIs. Windows 10 merges these back into one and feels more cohesive for it. The start menu will feel familiar to users of Windows 7 and Windows 8, and overall almost everything is an improvement. I still want the Windows 7 WiFi UI back, and a few other interfaces, but otherwise I think it's pretty good. If you decide to give it a try, I'd recommend a VM first since it might break some critical things (but ArcGIS isn't one - my work VPN in my case).

A lot of the basic online courses just teach you how to use the software, which you can pretty much do on your own anyways (online vids, tutorials, etc).   It's the theory behind things that you're really learning when you take a full blown GIS program. I did a 3 year GIS Diploma, and there were lots of courses in Cartography, Math, Surveying and programing so that we could understand what was actually happening with the data and how to produce the output.

Combine that with the fact that ArcMap is a buggy, frustrating program.  Some calculations/queries take a long time and/or give nonsensical results (yea yea GIGO, I know- that's a different story altogether) Tbh my degree in GIS was not so focused on how to work the program, it was more trying to get an analytical thought process developed.  Gathering data, running analyses, getting output is relatively simple.  Finding what question/phenomena to analyze is the more valued skill. Look around your world, find correlations and dig deeper to understand them.. That's a majority of a GIS degree."

Maybe the dataset you are using has usage restrictions/licensing agreements where you cannot give it away or could possibly have PII. I know these examples are not too relevant in your case, but from one public employee to another, just watch out. Make sure your supervisor is cool with you spending time fixing someone else's data.

At least at GeoEye we started off with 4 weeks PTO. A couple of my friends there are getting laid off this summer. Most of the QC positions can be done by entry level workers so they are laying off alot of the higher paid people.   That being said - it will be a good entry level position.

For instance, you can make AA fire a given rule when a geometry update happens or only on attribute update, then you could use python (or whatever) to generate a report on the number and types of changes that occurred through a given time period for a given user. The default AA config is all about their local gov model, but it's just an XML config, and the AA-related options are pretty limited. If you're prepared to do things with ArcObjects you can get it configured pretty easily.

gis,3837wa,flippmoke,3,Mon Jun 1 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"Those numbers sound a little slow, perhaps there are some issues with the indexing you have setup in PostGIS"
gis,3837wa,maptastik,3,Mon Jun 1 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"So have a moment so wanted to expand on some important thoughts here about indexing in PostGIS and dealing with timeseries.  Postgres/PostGIS does not natively deal well with multicolumn indexes. While you can search google and find some solutions this becomes an issue with timeseries data like points and geometry. Internally postgres will pick the index (if you have an index on Time and on the Geometry Column) that it feels like will result in the smallest initial section that it will then manually sort. You can do an EXPLAIN query to find out what it wants to do for a specific query internally.   So in layman's terms why this is an issue is because the branch of the geometry index's tree represents a bounding boxed region. Like this image here. That region will include points that are spread over a variety of times! This means that after sorting the points that might be in a region, it is going to have to sort through and find the times it needs. This is not an indexed search so will be MUCH slower.  The same is true for the reverse. It could be better to select just a small section of time and then manually find the points needed for the specific query.  As far as a solution:  I would suggest testing. Load all your data and try a variety of different queries and see which is fastest. You might find depending on the situation both indexes might be required. From my experience this solves most of the problems that you can have with point data that is organized as a timeseries.   However, that might not solve all your problems so lets go into more creative and somewhat crazy solutions:  1.) Organize your data as a 3D point, where time is one dimension. This is harder data to manage but the index is suddenly three dimensional! Like this image.   2.) Postgres (not PostGIS) and its standard indexes deal with multicolumn data very well, rather then using a geom column it might be a great idea to use 3 integer columns (time, x, y) and one geom column. Then apply an index over time,x, and y. Postgres natively will do bounding box queries against those 3 column indexes very quickly! However for queries that rely on the geom column you can still fall back on it for something like a nearest neighbor query."

gis,3837wa,VodkaBeatsCube,2,Tue Jun 2 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"They would work for large datasets, but the issue with large datasets and browsers is that often you are sending more data then is required for most situations.   Turf is a great way to do geometry operations in the browsers, but that doesn't necessarily mean its always the best solution alone. A 100 MB geojson sent to the browser each time will take a long time to load and be a waste of bandwidth.   I did a talk recently at my local maptime  titled An Introduction to GIS Problems. My advice that I gave in the presentation is that typically you want to match the right technology for the job and not try to force something in the wrong way.   So here are some of the problems that will happen with Tippaecanoe:  - Tippecanoe is that its going to make a static set of Vector Tiles that aren't necessarily dynamic and the tools for in browser Vector Tile work aren't quite there for selective data to be done easily in the browser. - There is a leaflet plugin which allows for the display of vector tiles, but I am thinking he wants to interactively search a select interval.   Another option would be to hook up something like that dynamically rendered Vector Tiles. At Mapbox we use tilelive-bridge for this. If this is a postgis database you could dynamically create vector tiles. However, this gets back to the importance of my questions to the OP where I am asking how the PostGIS is indexed. Because this will still be a slow point even if you implemented caching via something like tilelive-redis.   I will add some more points and suggestions to that above in a second."

So he can use the filtered data for broad level examination, and then switch to the full set for areas that need more precise data.   Also, it might be worth making sure that he knows the full set of points is still in the database, points are only removed when the tracks are displayed client side. This might be as simple a problem as him thinking that you're deleting points from the raw data."

My project manager and I are trying to think of ways to show subsets of the data, unfiltered, without loading all the points at once.   I think the client is overestimating how much we're generalizing the data - they seem to think that important points from the trails will be missing if there's a filter. Last night I sent an email with some images comparing multiple pairs of trails, one filtered and one unfiltered - I'm hoping they'll see that the trails are indistinguishable, and therefore having these trails showing (if only just as an overview, with options to add more points) won't mislead the user."

I guess I look at it as a sub-category to the industry you are in.  I am in the utility industry and have to basically be an engineer, statistics expert, map maker, analyst, and researcher.  I guess when you break it down the regular levels of GIS may not be a field.  But when you get into the software/algorithm development side of GIS, I would consider it a science.  There is science behind some of the things we do, but it could be considered “borrowed” from other fields rather than its own."
gis,382p80,Exodus89,4,Mon Jun 1 13:20:49 2015 UTC,Would be fare to say that it is a tool that can be used in science?
gis,382p80,Grateful-Fisherman,8,Mon Jun 1 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"Lets use an example.  I have conducted a soil study for a parcel of land.  I have gathered information at certain sites and then need to work out the rough coverage or hotspots for contamination in the soil.  How could I do this?  Well I could sit there and manually try to work it out by drawing approximated lines between points, or I could use a Geographic Information System program to run an Interpolation tool to achieve the same result.  I haven't stopped doing science, I have only used a program with many tools in order to achieve an outcome.  All of a sudden I discover an article that stipulates a timeline of government legislation that has influenced the deposition of said contaminant on the land parcel.  Now I have a human influenced side that doesn't sound like science right?  Well I can still use this social aspect to show the change over time of the site and show how it relates to the current situation (may find that one parcel of land was affected by legislation and the other not).  It is science and art coming together to explain a situation to provide an answer to a problem.  It is common to try and separate art and science when it comes to geography but it is important to recognise that they are both related and can impact upon one another.  Lets use another example. Satellite imagery.  If you look at a record of all tropical cyclones in Australia you will see that there weren't very many back in the 1900s and then all of a sudden around the 50's and 60's we see a large jump in cyclones.  Why? It is not because of climate change, it is because of satellites giving us a platform to report more tropical cyclones.  So is this a science issue or a social problem? Well ones that we didn't see were never reported but that doesn't mean they didn't happen.  So if we send out a boat to cross the pacific from Aus to the US but there is a cyclone that causes that ship to sink then obviously we need to find out why the ship sank so that they don't sink in future. So by developing satellites we developed a system to provide us the information about these cyclones we never knew of and the result was fewer instances of ships sinking by not knowing there was a cyclone out at sea.  The point is that a social problem of not knowing about some cyclones was fixed by the use of science to discover more of them.  The soil problem already had the science but the social side stepped in to assist the policy side to explain the discrepancies in the science.  This is one way of showing that science and art are quite inter-related when it comes to geography and geospatial analysis and it isn't necessarily correct to say it is ""just a science"" or ""just art"". It is more often than not a small mixture of both.  The important thing is recognising that there is a relationship between the two disciplines and that neglecting one side simply because it is not ""your field"" is incorrect.  TL;DR It always has been and always will be a mixture of both. Sometimes what is not understandable from on side can be explained by assistance/evidence from the other."

gis,382p80,CyndaquilTurd,2,Tue Jun 2 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The science of discovering spatial patterns in data that otherwise had no relationship, is purely a statistical modeling (e.g. PCA's, Logistic regression, Spatial Weighting Regression, correlation of data... etc) measurement that can be defined without the GIS.   These sciences are well established and existed well before Roger Tomlinson invented the first GIS system.  GIS is simply a tool that allowed us to manipulate data to the form we want before implementing these statistical tools.

gis,383dih,_matt_s_,2,Mon Jun 1 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"I once worked with a colleague who took on this problem.  Our goal was to simplify human-made boundaries (roads, townships, etc) differently from natural boundaries like rivers and lakes.  He generated, for any line segment, a ""coefficient of bendiness,"" which roughly described was -- of the total bearings (angle changes) on the line, how many are pretty much right angles vs how many are not right angles.  I think he also used the density of bearings as well, since a suburban neighborhood street can be free of right angles but typically doesn't wiggle as much as a river.  I'll dig up the code tonight and see if I can get a better description than the above.  But...  Needless to say the process involved playing with a lot of parameters and test data until the code produced results that the eye agreed with.  It's really gonna depend on your data I think.  One of the challenges to this approach was that some line segments were both natural and human-made.  For example, they started following a river and then became a highway.  Sometimes natural features aren't so natural either.  You'll have a bendy river that enters a canal or something and becomes as right-angled as a street.  What part of the world are you in, and what does your input data look like?"

While it includes loads of tilesets from several providers the important key for this case is that you can find 1) tilesets with no labels and 2) tilesets that are only labels. Layer them properly and you can get the desired effect.   For example, a project I did at work (zoom in for labels to show up).   You can check out my code here, but the basic bottom-to-top layering order I used was  CartoDB.DarkMatterNoLabels-my feature layers- Stamen.TonerLabels.  Edits: Formatting"

gis,380dug,flippmoke,3,Mon Jun 1 04:22:45 2015 UTC,"You can both with Mapbox Studio. You can upload data and stylize it in a custom way onto the tiles, and you can change the style of the base map to something custom.   I think what we are having is some confusion on terms here, I am hesitant to call it a tileset, because they are dynamically rendered based on your custom style!   Your ""tileset"" could include outside data. Here is a map I made that has basemap data (from OpenStreetMaps) with a custom basemap style + data on well sites in Oklahoma . There is then a custom style for the coloring of the wellsites.   The entire map is constructed in the browser using an extension of Leaflet Mapbox.js. (Studio provides the leaflet code for that map as well for me via a simple link).   If I wanted to use the interactive features of the basemap that was created for the tileset (well site data + basemap) with my own leaflet code I could. Can also get a tileset for just the base map or well site data alone, so you can provide a more interactive interface.   The crazy part is that since we store everything on the back end in vector tiles. Here is another great talk about vector tiles by Dane. Therefore you are really set for the future in some ways as we expanding how Vector Tiles are rendered. We are working on a spec similar to CartoCSS for how VectorTiles can be rendered by the graphics card locally! In some ways this is a replacement for Leaflet, but is going to allow awesome Maps going into the future!"

Just a thought.    Not that a story helps, but the interview for my first 'real' job after college was for a photogrammetry company and the primary duties were using AutoCAD and Integraph Microstation to correct and symbolize planimetric maps. The interview had a test where we were given a 'check plot' and were supposed to fix all the errors in AutoCAD. I'd never used CAD before and was freaking out.

IKONOS has a 144 day true-nadir, top down, temporal resolution and 3-5 day off-nadir, not top down but angular, temporal resolution.  For most analyses, this is fine. But if you need the exact same imagery capture parameters for consecutive days due to disasters or wars or the like, satellite imagery that's accessible to the public may not have a high enough temporal resolution to be as effective as aerial orthography.   Additionally, with aerial orthos, you get small swaths which means there's no need to rescale any data. A single IKONOS swath is 11km x 11km, 121 sq km. That's huge! Aerial orthos take more pictures at smaller swaths that get stitched together without any rescaling.  Here's another factor. Atmospheric conditions screw with satellite imagery. Clouds, smoke, contrails, planes. They get in the way. Aerial orthos can fly below this atmospheric interferences to obtains clean imagery."

Pros for aircraft: pilots choose the flight path of the vehichle so theres no waiting for a pass-over, plus you can get solid off nadir imagery if you need it.  Cons: it may be difficult to fly in a foreign country and not be detected so the satellite really shines in this area. Satellite passes over a country? Nobody gives a shit.

A true/false visibility field will be created within the random points for each of the towers. For all points that are true for each tower, use Near function to calculate distance from each random point to each visible tower. Symbolize by number of visible towers, and by proximity. For example all points that can see tower 1 red, tower 2 blue, etc. Have the color fade as distance away increases. it'll turn out like a heat map. I'm stoned as I type this, but this is how I'd go about it.   Edit: just reread your post. You'll need a dem, possibly a digital terrain model if you are counting for obstructions, do you have aerial lidar? That would be good. Also, take the distances and use field calculator to use your formula. I suppose you can turn your random points and create a raster from that, but I don't see a need.

The reason we are not using Mapbox GL Native is that I had this rendering engine two years ago - before there was any MapboxGL (ask John Firebaugh!). It has been optimized with the years and it has support for several OGC standards already. Nevertheless I really ought to sit down and try your library... I have seen a number of really impressive and awesome demos of it!"

gis,37s2cv,library_sheep,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"Twelve-Mile Circle:       The 12-Mile Circle is an approximately circular arc which forms most of the boundary between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Delaware in the United States. It is not actually a circle, but rather a combination of different circular arcs that have been feathered together.    It is nominally a circle with a supposed—yet in fact only approximate and variable—12-mile (19 km) radius,  centered in the town of New Castle, Delaware. In 1750, the center of the circle was fixed at the cupola of the courthouse in New Castle. The 12-Mile Circle continues into the Delaware River. A small portion of the circle, known as the ""Arc Line,"" also forms part of the Mason-Dixon line, separating Delaware and Maryland. Two other small portions, although not actually demarcated until 1934, form parts of the boundary between the states of Delaware and New Jersey.  Although the 12-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the United States that is a true arc (excepting those following arcs of latitude and longitude), the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs,  and many cities in the South (such as Plains, Georgia ) also have circular boundaries.  Its existence dates back to 1681, when Charles II granted a deed to William Penn north of the already chartered Maryland. Charles created an exception, consisting of 12 miles around the town of New Castle and extending down the peninsula, as these lands were held by the Duke of York, who had won them in conquest from the Dutch colonists. Later, on August 24, 1682, the Duke granted these lands to Penn as well, giving him:    Image i - The 12-Mile Circle     Interesting: Wedge (border) | Transpeninsular Line | Geography of New Jersey | History of Delaware   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

When I went last year, I went to a scattershot bunch of sessions and technical workshops, but I was half figuring out a specialty, half job-searching. Check if there's a meetup for people in your area, and I think there might be an informal meetup of r/gis users, but I don't think definite plans have been nailed down.  If you're a regular browser of /MapPorn, check out the Map Gallery in your spare time, and if you're there Monday night, check out their reception. Last year, it had really an incredible array of maps - I got a lot of good feedback on my entry, and made contacts with several people in my area to get copies of their maps for a map exhibition at my school. The Expo floor is a whirlwind, and I made some promising contacts there too, but nothing that led to a job.  Another suggestion: make sure your hotel is on the transit system - the traffic outside the con looked far too ferocious for my taste. A professor who helped me get to UC last year steered me to a good hotel."

My brother got a job doing just that and I was able to interview twice while at the conference a couple of years ago. Keep an eye out for regional user group meetings and parties. There are events going on in the convention center most evenings Monday to Wednesday. These are a great way to meet people in your area, as well as get free booze and food. The wastewater pool party is always a fun time and has been held the last few years on Wednesday night at a hotel in the area. Network! Also, go to sessions that interest you, introduce yourself to people doing stuff that you like. Get a card, friend them on LinkedIn, keep in touch."

I'm hitting 2 geo and two other conferences this year, so I got new sneakers and custom inserts that I am currently breaking in.  A refillable water bottle.  Last year they had water coolers, that's a lot of cash you can spend at the bar instead of water bottles.  A portable external battery for your phone.  Unless they changed something since last time, outlets were at a premium, so bring your own juice.  Think about what you want to accomplish next year, sit down with the conference planner, and focus your efforts.

gis,37i3gn,djup92,2,Wed May 27 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of. If your paper tables exist as a table (excel or DBF or other database) with some field that works as a unique identifier for each feature (like a serial number) then you can just do a table join. If your GIS points don't have any attributes at all, typical for my experience of imported CAD data, then adding just the unique ID for each point would be less labor-intensive than inputting the data for 5 fields. Just make sure the ID in the GIS data and the ID in the table are the same data type (string, numeric, etc) this has tripped me up joining census data to geography more times than I can count. What software are you using? I always did this in ArcGIS Desktop, where I'd right-click on the target layer in the Table of Contents (the GIS points, in your example) and click Joins and Relates > Add Join."

gis,37i3gn,lyingmap,2,Wed May 27 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it? I last worked with importing CAD data in 9.2 and the data I worked with was exported by someone else so I had no control over constraints, and we could never get any attributes at all, and the location was all messed up so we'd have to move things from Algeria to California and set the size manually and it was just a mess. But I have no experience with importing CAD data into 10.3, I understand it's easier and there may be some tools in the Toolbox, but I don't have firsthand knowledge.  But yes, unless someone more knowledgeable gainsays me, the best way would be to give each object a unique ID (like a manhole number), either in CAD or in ArcGIS, then bring the attributes over in an excel or DBF or CSV file and join them using a table join. Then export the joined layer to a separate shapefile if you want to use it in different maps. A table join only exists in the MXD you make it in, and you have to export to a new feature class or shapefile if you want to keep using it.  Good luck, and I hope this helps."

If CAD is done right, it's pretty easy to get the data / layers from CAD into GIS. It seems to be a bit of a pain for CAD to get to shapefiles. From what I've been shown it's not the easiest process to get the shapefile. (it's not terrible but more steps than I think it should be).    I've been playing with the ""export to CAD"" in Arc 10.3 and I can't quite figure it out so it works seamlessly. You can export multiple features as CAD layers into a single DWG (or append a DWG) but from what I've tried is not retaining the attributes. And without a bit of extra work.

Start by loading one of your KML tracks. Right click it in the Layers panel. Select Save As -->Type=ESRI Shapefile. Name it ""MasterTracks.shp"" or something.   Select the newly created shapefile by highlighting it in the Layers panel, then click the single pencil icon on the toolbar to put the shapefile into edit mode.   Load new KML file into QGIS by dragging it onto the open window. Select the KML it in the Layers panel. Use the Select tool (Arrow cursor and dotted box) to select the desired tracks. Go to Edit --> Copy.   Now select your MasterTracks.shp file in the Layers panel. Go to Edit --> Paste. Click the little Save icon next to the Pencil icon.   Now close the KML layer you just copied by right clicking it in the Layers panel and removing it. Import the next KML file you want to copy.   Repeat.   After you've added all of your KML tracks, Select the layer one last time, click the save icon in the toolbar, then click the pencil to take it out of edit mode. Right click the MasterTracks.shp in the Layers panel. Select Save As. Filetype=KML. Name it ""MergedTracks.KML"" and save it to the desktop.

gis,37eo6r,Lolawolf,1 point,Wed May 27 02:03:52 2015 UTC,I would honestly enjoy both field and office work at first just to say that I have the experience ya know? But I wouldn't want to do field work for too long.
gis,37eo6r,Lolawolf,2,Wed May 27 02:51:24 2015 UTC,"I guess if I had to generalise both fields, geology would be closer to the physical sciences and GIS would be closer to computer science. I think there's very minor, if any, overlap. Depends on what you're interested in!  To address a couple of your other questions:  You're right, GIS being a new-ish field means employers are still trying to suss its value, so a lot of work is underpaid. Pay should reach more appropriate levels as GIS becomes more firmly established, and there will be good money to make in GIS development or management.  Masters programs should be picked based on what you want to do with GIS. I know some people who wanted to start their own business, so they got an MBA. Some went on to do an MPA, since a lot of GIS work is in government. Others went on to do statistics and focused on spatial statistics. There are a lot of options. I would advise against doing a masters in pure GIS, since a lot of schools are behind the times in what current employers want. GIS is a tool, so you'd need to find out what you want to apply it towards.  That said, you'll probably make the most money in petroleum geology, if that's what you're interested in."

I've found that the salary is generally higher than that of other industries that use GIS. If you end up going the Geology route and want to be a Petroleum Geologist, you will (most likely) need a masters.  Good choice on Texas A&M! I went there too.

I'm not against getting my masters, but I'm not sure what to get my bachelors in then. I'd like to have a job while I work on getting my masters, but I'm really confused about what I should be getting my bachelors in and then what to get my masters in. All I know is that I want to be a petroleum geologist and that a bachelors in this is probably not good enough..

gis,37eo6r,Grateful-Fisherman,1 point,Wed May 27 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Geologists make more because they are responsible for more on analyzing data rather then configuring how it is input and displayed. It is the reason they will make more then a GIS person (sorry). It also is a more prestigious degree in the eyes of the industry.   If oil and natural gas is the industry you love there are lots of ways to enter that industry. Don't limit your thoughts to just GIS (sorry to everyone in here). If you think GIS might be something you enjoy, don't be afraid to try to do something on your own before college and start a side project just for fun.  Here is every well site in Oklahoma colored by age. This was a fun side project for me because I am interested in Oil and Natural Gas (but program GIS software and applications for work).   You will learn quickly what you enjoy doing and what you don't. I graduated as an Aerospace Engineer major and wasn't interested in a job at all in that. Don't worry about money first, worry more about what you enjoy. Keep in mind that a GIS job at an Oil and Gas Industry might be more GIS then Oil and Gas."
gis,37eapd,IHavenI,1 point,Wed May 27 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"Using a calculator I got an answer of 0.32 meters squared. To me that seems off as I imagine that your file covers a much larger area. The cell size seems very small. You have the right idea by calculating the pixel area and then multiplying that number by the pixel count. So 0.00025x0.00025 = 0.0000000625 * 5148950 = 0.32. Maybe someone has a better response, but that's the best I can come up with."
gis,37eapd,LazerKoala,1 point,Wed May 27 01:06:10 2015 UTC,You know if there's a good way to possibly convert the decimal answer into a whole number? I've tried resample to change the cell size but that doesn't work.
gis,37eapd,LazerKoala,1 point,Wed May 27 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well resampling is not going to do much because it will just increase your cell size and pixel count but not change the final answer. However, 0.00025 meters is 0.025 centimeters or 0.25 millimeters so 3218.1 centimeters squared or 321809.375 millimeters squared (as long as my math is right and I'm fairly sure it is). Just using unit conversions is the best way. I'm not sure what your looking to do with that final number, if its just for a report or something else, but you should be able to adjust units in whatever program your using. If you use ArcMap you can tell it to calculate for different units I'm pretty sure, I've never worked with a cell size that small before."

As /u/FannyMcFlaps said, if you have the budget for it, going up to the UX501 would give you a lot of performance.

No, it's a built in card as well.  I was trying to find a bit of a medium in performance versus cost.  The Intel 5500 HD is at the better end of the built in cards; but, would still be a bottle neck on the system if you do a lot of graphical work (large rasters, 3d modeling such as sketchup, etc).  If at all possible within your budget, look for an nVidia or AMD graphics card in the system. Actually, the Asus ROG system /u/xantek posted is a great (much better than the Dell I had found) system to look at.  The nVidia geForce 960M is going to be a great card, the Core i7 CPU is going to be overkill until you get into heavy computational processing; but, will be rock solid for a long time.  16GB of RAM is just nice all around.  The only downside is that it has a spinning disc hard drive.  However, this isn't the end of the world.  And, for most laptops, changing out the hard drive is really easy.  You could plan this for an upgrade when your wallet recovers from the initial purchase. I'm going to agree with a lot of the other folks in this thread that you will probably grow to hate a 13"" screen.  But, I have known people who were willing to make that trade off for the weight.  We used to give students Dell Precision mobile workstations and the biggest complaint was that it was like carrying a brick everywhere.  Also, for smaller systems, you can usually use a docking station with an external monitor, keyboard and mouse to get the full desktop feel, while still having the ultra-light system.

Very large existing code-base. This includes a lot of GIS related libraries, but also many general statistical tools that might be helpful. R generally acts as a more self-contained package than Python. (Not to say Python can't - but you generally see it integrated with another GIS program, like Arc).   Disadvantages of R:   Much less direct integration in other software - both Arc and QGIS have Python integration. There was some R functionality in a QGIS plugin - but I've not seen any recent development in that direction. The user-base tends to be more academic (depending on your background this may not be such a disadvantage). From speaking to more computer-science oriented people, a lot of the internal/more advanced features are less intuative than Python. Very little consistency in code styling. While this might not sound like much of an issue, it's really frustrating when working with several people's code at once.   Overall, I'd say Phython is probably the long-term better language for GIS, though you'll probably do ok with either.  (edit: formatting)"

Even your disadvantages are questionable. Python is widely used in academia as well.  As for ""intuitive"" that's really in the eye of the beholder, but as far as programming ans scripting languages go, Python is pretty easy to make ""just work.""

The standalone thing is more to do with my not finding a IDE that feels as good as or has the functionality of RStudio.

It works mostly the same on most OSes, it supports everything, there are web implementations, and there's a huge user base and it seems like almost everything has been tried with it.  R in the other hand is narrowly tailored for a few kinds of applications, mostly stats and data analysis. This is great, and for those purposes, it has really taken off as a replacement for some more proprietary approaches.  It just so happens that GIS is one of Python's particular strong suits. If you are mainly into GIS, I think Python is the number 1 language, period.   In general, Javascript, though a pretty awful programming language, is ubiquitous and does everything these days too, so it and maybe C++ are the only panguages that can compete wih Python on every level and be relevant.

gis,3739au,dixerdorothy,2,Mon May 25 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"Hi mate,  I'm new to GIS, just started learning it as apart of my Environmental Engineering thesis so there is probably a much easier way to do this that an actual GIS person will suggest below, but here is what i'd do:  1) Select green spaces by attribute  2)Use the buffer tool to create a new layer consisting of the 300m buffer on the green space  3)Use select by location to select all residential zones that do NOT exist inside the buffer layer  Theres a good chance this is not the easiest or even correct way of doing this so ill follow your post to see how it can be done better haha."
gis,3739au,Omsun12,2,Sun May 24 14:56:50 2015 UTC,If you want to use a buffer that could still work. You could buffer the residential areas and use select by location in the attribute table to select all residential buildings within the 300 meter buffer. Then invert the selection to get you values outside the 300 meter buffer.   Personally i would use Euclidean distance and conditional statements and set up a small model to do this calculation.

You could simply store bus routes in geojson and push them bush locations via something like a websocket. Then I would overlay all of this using a basemap provided by Mapbox or other services. Leaflet would be the library you would probably want to use to overlay the map and GIS information.  Also if you wanted to track internally how long segments usually take you simply update the geojson that you push them having different weights on them.

gis,36yqav,chippeh,5,Sat May 23 08:00:32 2015 UTC,What's the main difference between Mapnik 2 and Mapnik 3?
gis,36yqav,Teiron,5,Sat May 23 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between Mapnik 2 and Mapnik 3 is honestly the internal capabilities of Mapnik and how we see it growing in the future. It gives developers the power to do more then simply style maps, but rather also manipulate data. These capabilities for now are not easy to use as they are deep within our C++ code. However, they have formed the basis for us to create vector tiles.   Some major changes internally were to convert the code to rely on C++11 standard. This was done so that we could write code that we could more easily develop and grow.  Another big change was that the Python Bindings for mapnik were moved out into their own codebase. We have had this in our node bindings for some time, but wanted to have python the same. The reason for this is that we can iterate on the python code separate from the core library. To python developers this means a couple things:    We are attempting to make python easy to install, simply by doing ""pip install mapnik"" rather then requiring in depth knowledge of how to compile things in C++. This should also speed up how quickly bugs and new features will reach python developers. We are looking at spending time to port creation code for vector tiles into python bindings, as they already exist in the node bindings. We can better write documentation and support directly for python developers.   Another big part of Mapnik 3, that has been an issue in Mapnik 2 is that we are looking at how we can better support the community around Mapnik. While this isn't a feature directly in the code, it should help give better insight into how to use Mapnik as it is already a powerful tool. You should expect to see sometime soon:   The start of better documentation of the API in all bindings More examples of how to use Mapnik in all its bindings A complete make-over of mapnik.org.    I hope that provides a good overview of our intentions. The goal is to make Mapnik a more powerful tool as we head forward."

Some of the coolest things I have seen at Mapbox are:   Our latest mobile project which has been in the works for a long time. This is a fully GL capable drop in for anyone's application. Mapbox GL in genernal and its abilities to do stuff like this which are driven from vector tiles. Take this map hit ctrl and move your mouse. Its amazing to me the future of GIS with GL. Mapbox Studio   Mapnik plays a huge part of in a lot of these things at Mapbox.  However, there are lots of awesome things that people are using with Mapnik outside of Mapbox:   CartoDB Openstreetmap in general is really amazing to me, its awesome to me that they use Mapnik.

Don't worry about the skills you will need, if you are passionate about the project you will find what skills you need to complete it! Thats the best suggestion I can give you."
gis,3709z3,flippmoke,3,Sat May 23 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, congrats on the transfer. I graduated one year ago with a BA in geography from a US school and now work as a cartographer/analyst for a national environmental nonprofit. Here is a bit of my experience with GIS/things I wish I knew.  If you think of GIS as a progression from data collection, to analysis, to presentation (with a whole bunch of smaller steps) it's important to get a flavor for each step especially early on. Once you have a sense of the whole process you can start figuring out what areas you would like to dive into. For me, I got interested in making really good looking maps which led me to the Adobe Creative Cloud and other tools I didn't know existed when I went to geography. Unless you know what you want to specialize in, try a bit of everything.  Assuming you have 2-4 years of classwork available I would recommend going broad your first year or so and then starting to specialize later on. I went into college with a pretty specific four year courseload planned out and that quickly changed as I met professors, added minors, and had the chance to do research which broaden and narrowed my interests. Hopefully you can get some internships or other experiences in the summer or during the year which will help guide your interests. Nothing worse than spending four years doing remote sensing only to get a job in that field and realize you hate it. Sadly stuff like that happens.  I am a terrible drawer, but I am glad my department made us take a mandatory hand cartography course. It's one of those things that you may hate while in the class, but the lessons you learn stick much better than learning the same principles on the computer. Things like proper scaling, symbology, and color schemes come to mind. I was later a teaching assistant for a GIS intro course, and I could tell which students had taken the cartography course by looking at the maps. I'f you have time and your school offers it, I would recommend it.  Having good cartography and design sense is crucial in most mapping jobs and can be a huge bonus in other fields. Think of it like public speaking. It doesn't matter how ""correct"" something is if no one can see through all the design problems to understand it. Having a well made portfolio of different projects, be they traditional maps, or other cartographic tools is such a huge advantage when looking for a job, grad school or other opportunities.   I can't speak to Python or Remote Sensing, so I'll let others give you feedback. My only advice is to try it all and pursue what sticks. Python or another coding language are buzzword that every HR person looks for so if you can reasonably put that on a resume (even if you might need a refresher once you land the job...) then go for it. Remote sensing is much less common, but depending on the field you care about, it could be a requirement to get in.   I always feel it is most important to get the basics down well, have a great portfolio, and to be flexible. Most jobs out of college are not perfect matches of what you studied so it's important to be able to fit into as many different roles as possible.  I'm really starting to ramble but if you have any other questions feel free to comment back or message me. Like I said I'm a year out of the process so hopefully I can give you some timely advice on some decisions.   Peace"

So I'm going to agree with /u/jefesignups on this...probably one of the most important aspects that I've come across is a better understanding of python...but you can have multiple classes on just that subject so it's dependent on how much time you really want to spend on the topic.

Or what topics would you have wished were covered in more depth?   In between jobs right now but... At the very least, some introduction to scripting and query languages and some basic (geo)databse concepts. Those are really things to structure a whole course around, but it would have been nice if they at least introduced the subject (it would be great if GIS programs in general did more to encourage people towards development or design rather than treating GIS as its own separate silo. but I digress). The labor market is so tight at the moment that new grads need something to get a leg up. More and more you see GIS professionals crossing over into developer or DBA territory, and on the other hand you see developers and data professionals doing more geospatial stuff.

Nightmare for my OCD), especially since this will be something I need to keep updated and accurate (within a few feet if possible).   I recommend using a file geodatabase to as your working database. In it you can create feature datasets to organize your data while maintaining correct projections for all your data.   I also used the measure tool to measure the distance from my point to the edge of the buffer, and it showed close to 1300', not 1000'. Someone on the forums said this was likely because I'm using a Geographic Coordinate set, and not a Projected one, which I still don't quite understand.   Are you in the US? If so, I'd recommend using the state plane projection. Just figure out what state plane you're in and go with it.  As far as the distances, take your points, once you haven't them projected to state plane and in your file geodatabes and use the Buffer tool. It'll automatically create buffers of the size you input around all your points.   Basically, I am looking for any advice on some tutorials or...anything, really. I just ordered ""Getting to know arcGIS for desktop"" and plan on studying it for the foreseeable future, but since my boss expected me to already have it mastered and have a finished map, I'm looking for any other helpful information someone might have.

gis,36x5nw,socioevo,3,Fri May 22 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"Wow a true blank slate. :) Welcome to GIS.  I second the use of a file geodatabase. It's the easiest way to keep your geo data organized. All those files on your desktop are probably the pieces of shapefiles. One shapefile can have 7 to 10 different files with it. (shp, shx, dbf, prj, etc). It's very very important to keep these together if you are going to use shapefiles. If you continue with shapefiles, make a directory like c:\gis\shapes\ (for example) and in that directory make other folders specific to your tasks.  With shapefiles, there are three essential files. SHP is the geometry / geography, DBF is the attribute data (basically), SHX is the shape index. PRJ the projection info is not essential, but nice to have. It's general good practice to always keep all the associate files of a shapefile together They will all have the same name before the extension. (file.shp, file.dbf, file.shx, file.prj, etc).    That book is good. I've used that for other newbies. Here's a good starter course that might help a bit. Another more in depth    And definitely take /u/socioevo up on his offer. Same offer from me if he / she isn't around."
gis,36x5nw,xod1ak,2,Sat May 23 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"I would do this:    Make a directory and call it <project>. Under that make a series of sub directories called pdf, data, temp, spreadsheets. Make it easy on yourself. Also - spend extra time getting organized. Make notes (txt files) in each directory.  shapefiles are usually between 4 and 8 different files in size. So when you copy them - be sure to grab everything. you can find with that name and move them into your data directory.  You will want to right click on your file in Arcmap - go to properties - and see what projection you are using. I will guess WGS84 - but there is no telling. You need to get that into a local projection for your city (probably a state wide projection). Projections are the worst starting out - but not insurmountable.    Getting to 3 will be a bit of work. After three:  4. Reproject data.  5. Buffer.  6. Make a map and look like a hero.

(Geospatial data hasn't been well funded at the Federal Level - and it has certainly been mis-managed - but that's a different story)  I'd recommend contacting the state BLM office of the PLSS you want - by phone - and getting in touch with their GIS person.  Ask if they can provide you with a download - or if they'd be willing to load the data on a memory stick.  Alternatively, there are private vendors that can/will sell you the I data. I know IHT, and Whitestar both sell PLSS grid data.  Be aware that the GCDB is the only truly survey-based digital PLSS data out there.

Double click the field from Table1 that is suppose to connect to Table2. Click the ""="" button. Double click the field from Table2 that will connect to Table1.

gis,36mesm,MAYOROFPOUNDTOWN,2,Wed May 20 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"""GCS_North_American_1983_HARN"" is NAD83 with High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), and NAD83 = GRS80 (NAD83 = GRS80, notice the ellipsoid values are the same).  The difference between NAD83 and NAD83(HARN) is ~5 to 10 cm better accuracy (positions are accurate to better than 1 cm). HARN is a network of GPS stations that improved the geodetic accuracy of NAD83.  It seems ArcGIS uses NAD83(HARN) coordinates, but QGIS (which uses the proj4 library) uses GRS80 as it's good enough. So I don't think there's much to worry about unless you need 1cm or better accuracy.  http://www2.arnes.si/~gljsentvid10/datm_faq.html#1  Also, the European equivalent is ETRS89."

From my testing which was primarily done using an iPhone 5, I found both the positions and compass directions to be well within the tolerances required for the system to work. While the iPhone is not as great with moving accuracy, while stationary I found it to be as accurate as my handheld Garmin GPS unit.   Occasionally, the phone would capture some GPS coordinates that were just dead wrong, about a mile away from where they should've been.  this also corresponded with an incorrect read out of the latitude and longitude, because my approach had to rely on regular expressions to parse the raw data into a format that would play nicely with the software.

Because of how the Coordinates are represented in EXIF, one of the challenges of the project was manipulating them into something usable. I had to use a regular expressions script to parse the single string of numbers into separate fields for DD,MM,SS then covert from DMS to decimal degrees for happier processing.

Look at all the mapping tools on mobile phones, etc  GIS will end up being another tool alongside microsoft office instead of being a specific set of specialist skills that one person in the office has.  GIS is being overtaken by other professions who are using it for themselves with no mention of GIS. See web developers, data scientists, etc.  I fact I was interested to see a Data Scientist recently claiming that John Snow's and his Cholera Maps as being the start of Data Science with not one mention of this being the start of GIS or even any mentioned of GIS.

With web mapping and developers making everything automated, who needs GIS Analysts or Techs??  Well I see that there will still be a need for the analyst to provide the higher level stuff.  The technician will still need to input the data at the ""low level"" and the developer might go away due to software sets being setup for what you need out of the box rather than building custom tools.  Someone is still going to have to setup the web maps, make decisions and input the data.  Now that I have gone on a tangent, I totally agree with you about specialized skills.  Programming is a huge thing with GIS currently, alongside with web development.  But I don’t believe a programmer takes the place of an Analyst with programming skills.   Me personally, I have been trying to get into a company that is on the forefront of web mapping and development.  This is what I see in the future and want to have these skills to push ahead (since I’m young in my career).     Keep in mind as well; a lot of smaller companies are starting up their GIS departments which is a great opportunity for people to get in.

If you're interested, my version is written in R for handling images, you might find it helpful - though a lot of it is taken up with reading, splitting and writing the files.  There's a few guides online which probably give better detail - from memory the outline of the process is:  1 - Calculate a covariance matrix (a table of the covariance of each input with all other inputs).  2 - Calculate the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (you're on your own here I'm afraid, I used R's eigen function to handle this).  3 - Multiply the original inputs by the eigenvalues (Again, I'm not 100% sure how you get matrix multiplcation in Excel).  4 - (optional) bring the data back to expected ranges, as the calculation of PCA will often give very weird ranges (orders of magnitude larger or smaller than input).  Or if you can find a way to write your Excel data to an image, most RS software pakages (and possibly ArcGIS?) will calculate PCA for you - so you don't have to bother with any of this :p."

gis,3627xq,Bbrhuft,2,Fri May 15 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into pgRouting because all of the data is stored in an MsSql database (I also didn't know it existed). ESRI tools make this task fairly simple as long as the data is strong. I've tested it with a small dataset and all of the JS and etc... was pretty straightforward.  I just need to figure out how to get the right data... Or if just piping it off to google who has spent a ton of time and money doing this would be the way to go. I think they give something like 2,000 daily direction requests through their API."

gis,362nbd,jkiss12,2,Fri May 15 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"If you have ArcGIS, find a global boundaries dataset (diva-gis.org has one), set the data frame projection to the same projection as the image (which looks like GCS WGS 1984). Import the image, under display, change transparency to 50%, then use the georeferencing tool to place points from the image at the same points in the global boundaries data set."
gis,362nbd,GIS_LiDAR,1 point,Fri May 15 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Do you have data that defines the climate zones? If so, you can easily create a map like this in MapViewer. You can use the included GSB boundary files to create the world map background, and you can overlay the climate zones. Creating a shapefile is as easy as clicking File | Export and selecting SHP for the file type."

gis,35y5bp,patchez11,5,Thu May 14 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"Its not bad software, I know the City of Albuquerque uses it for their apps. But honestly, with the advent of the ArcGIS web app builder, Javascript API, leaflet, etc. I dont see a need to pay for a developer platform if you are already running an ESRI shop.  my 2c."
gis,35y5bp,erdkunde,3,Thu May 14 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"My background is primarily with esri's Javascript API, leaflet, and I beta tested web app builder.  I still haven't quite figured out the reasoning behind Geocortex."
gis,35y5bp,erdkunde,3,Thu May 14 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"I think its just one step behind emerging technology. You should bring this up with your current employer, could save you all a nice chunk of budget."
gis,35y5bp,letrow,4,Thu May 14 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'm keeping a low profile for now. Seeing as how the company I work for is still actively developing silverlight applications, suggesting a full switch might be a little extreme and creating waves as the new guy doesn't always go over well."
gis,35y5bp,Eogris,2,Thu May 14 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Silverlight? They will have to come to that conclusion on their own.  I remember Geocortex from the days of ArcIMS. They were far ahead, but it's hard to see the advantages today, except their database linking tool. That is slick for non programmers and something I think ESRI should have baked into all of their products by now."
gis,35y5bp,le_chad_,1 point,Fri May 15 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Calmly give them reasonable, solid evidence to back your claims. You're there to be useful not sit on your hands when you can save them money."
gis,35y5bp,le_chad_,2,Thu May 14 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"The reasoning is likely for those who aren't skilled enough to do it from scratch, or who don't retain their employees so need these kinds of tools for continuity."
gis,35y5bp,gorgeous_bastard,3,Thu May 14 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a development platform, at least not the last time I used it a couple years ago. But it's definitely a useful tool to spin up some quick viewers or editing portals.    I used to work for a city in the L.A. area and it was great for giving various departments quick and easy access to their data to maintain on their own. It's also pretty easy to add in widgets and authentication."
gis,35y5bp,speegler,1 point,Thu May 14 15:13:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wasn't exactly sure how to describe it ""development platform"" was the best I could come up with at the time since I thought ""tool"" might have been an oversimplification"
gis,35y5bp,pencil_and_paper,2,Thu May 14 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I gotchya. Guess I didn't need to be so pedantic.    To expand though, I think it can be a great resource for rapid prototyping and simple solutions without a lot of business analysis or dev time."
gis,35y5bp,Foreva40,3,Fri May 15 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"I've evaluated it 3 times now and always come to the same conclusion. It's a great tool if you don't have anyone technologically capable of going beyond the basics that esri provide. They fill a niche between esri releasing new capabilities via the API and it being available in the web app builder.  That being said, if you have good people it's just not worth the money, you'll get better worth out of the cash spent elsewhere as it just doesn't offer enough value over the esri tools imo.  Additionally I've heard they don't always have a great relationship with esri as the web app builder occupies a similar space and has the advantage of being an in house tool, so bigger resources and better baked into the esri ecosystem.  So yeah it's 50/50 for me, great for some teams but if you have an experienced team not worth the investment."
