AnglerPorn,3df89g,butchin,8,Wed Jul 15 20:20:17 2015 UTC,This is the most beautiful trout I have ever seen. I want these to be populated and reintroduced. I would love pulling one of these in if they were in abundance. Absolutely beautiful trout.   Edit: just read up that these trout are a chromosomal anomaly and that they are born sterile with only 80 chromosomes compared to a normal brown trout with 84. Nature is crazy.
AnglerPorn,3df89g,FoodBornChillness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:02:11 2015 UTC,Wow then that makes them VERY rare. so rare you can't even breed them in captivity if you wanted to.

AnglerPorn,3c6hz1,MustangMaster,2,Sun Jul 5 09:38:26 2015 UTC,This one did! I was pretty surprised when I pulled it up since I'm going for cats. Corn is the best for carp in my opinion.
AnglerPorn,3c6hz1,imliterallydyinghere,2,Sun Jul 5 09:49:47 2015 UTC,Not corn  take a bucket and mix oatmeal and cream corn till its chunky like paste. Maybe a little ketchup. Put one corn pop (cereal) on the hook and pack a large blob of oatmeal mix around it  cast out. When it hits bottom it scatters and the carp suck it up and can't get the corn pop off the hook and suck it up too
AnglerPorn,3c6hz1,imliterallydyinghere,2,Sun Jul 5 13:52:44 2015 UTC,carp in july? If you want to eat it let it swim in your bathtub for a few days otherwise it'll taste like mud.

Longer than the state record but not as girthy, Simonson’s fish ate a Whistler jig baited with a nightcrawler somewhere between 25 and 30 feet deep in a seam.  Cody was lifting his jig a foot and a half off the bottom, letting it free fall, and repeating.  “I was going through the standard routine of zoning out jigging, not thinking a whole lot about it, and, yeah, it bit. It seems like that’s usually when I get the fish … I didn’t think it was giant fish or anything.  I thought, ‘Man, this is a heavy fish,’ but it was nothing outrageous considering the size the fish ended up being. It was  typical walleye in cold water; he was sluggish, and he didn’t want to come up. We were shocked when I got it to the boat, and it didn’t want to fit in our net; it’s a little shy for a 34-inch fish.”  “When I weighed it on the digital scale my dad had on the boat. it came in at 18 pounds, and I would say that was a few ounces conservative,” said Simonson. “We also took some measurements, and the length was 34.5 inches, and the girth was 21.0 inches … It is by far the biggest walleye I have ever caught.  It sure dwarfed the 9-pounder my dad caught that day … I’ve caught a few 10-pounders before, but nothing close to this fish.”  Cody and Jim were fishing somewhere above McNary Dam, but NOT in one of the famous public holes like Buoy 30, Foundation Island, or Indian Island, places where large numbers of anglers concentrate their efforts these days.  Cody won’t divulge their specific location, saying only, “My dad and I go fishing a lot, and we experiment and try quite a few different places. And we’re not looking for big fish, just smaller eater fish — any walleye in general. They are really good to eat.”  “I wasn’t needing the meat, plus those older walleye are not as tasty as the smaller ones, so I decided to let it go. My dad even got a few pics of me releasing it. I figured with all the pics and measurements, a fiberglass replica is in my future.  This is one of those fish you can’t not get a mount of,” Simonson chuckled."

Caught it using a 7oz Snapper Slapper with squid. All-Star heavy action roller rod, Penn Squall 20LW, with 50 lb braided Spectra line.  Also caught a 15 lb kingfish, a bluefish, and a couple red snapper so I would say the trip was pretty successful!!"

AnglerPorn,38xo0i,wyowill,14,Sun Jun 7 21:02:47 2015 UTC,I don't. Nobody does. It is very rare for them to be caught on hook and line (which is part of the reason for the overpopulation). These were all shot on a pole spear ~140ft deep on an oil rig. They are quite easy to shoot and rely on their spines.

AnglerPorn,38ui0z,hobdodgeries,3,Sun Jun 7 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"Oh there is a bit of technical skill required to fillet the carp. From removing scales to filleting it. Bones are very hard but also that's why it's easy to spot.   BUT! If you get a chance , should look up poaching carp in oil. It's amazingly delicious.

AnglerPorn,38ui0z,hobdodgeries,13,Mon Jun 8 01:59:17 2015 UTC,Can you eat gold fish?  I'm sure you can but is it worth the trouble?
AnglerPorn,38ui0z,rekin0m,25,Sun Jun 7 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Goldfish in captivity will likely taste like what you feed them (pellets or flakes), but goldfish raised in ponds and lakes feed on bugs, insects, and smaller fish. The best description I can give is that it has a taste of catfish and a consistency of bass. I'd recommend frying it, but that's the only way my uncle and dad always cooked them up. Happy fishing!"
AnglerPorn,38ui0z,Zogremite,5,Sun Jun 7 01:02:03 2015 UTC,Depends on if you like carp or not.

Can anybody explain it?"
AnglerPorn,38ui0z,TurtleOfTheArtic,2,Mon Jun 8 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"Many, if not most, of those are not goldfish. In fact, I'm pretty sure one of them is a catfish or bullhead."

This pic was taken 3 summer sago so my memory is a bit hazy on the details. I do know that that's Mt. Bonneville & friends behind my dad in the pic. That was our main destination. Fishin for the Goldens in the alpine lakes at their bases.

AnglerPorn,38spks,Stianon,2,Sat Jun 6 21:35:28 2015 UTC,Yeah but you should eat the smaller variety of any fish. Because any extremely large fish usually have higher mercury levels. Also better genes so if they spawn more stronger fish to get that big again. But if it died in process of catching it might as well eat it.

AnglerPorn,38ssgr,tweaks8,7,Sat Jun 6 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"For reference, a 400 lb bluefin sold for $37500 earlier this year."
AnglerPorn,38ssgr,droppinbabies,9,Sat Jun 6 17:27:24 2015 UTC,A 1000 lb blue fin could fetch anywhere between 2-3 million. That's a lot of clams!
AnglerPorn,38ssgr,Zogremite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Any idea how much this sold for? The average bluefin on Discovery Channel's ""Wicked Tuna"" is around 5-20k and 300-600lbs from what I have seen."
AnglerPorn,38ssgr,RanOut_ofTalent,10,Sat Jun 6 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"This particular bluefin was published in a 2012 huffington article. It sold for 30,000 USD. Bluefin tuna varies EXTREMELY in price due to supply/demand. During the opening days of bluefin tuna season, some can go for upwards of 1 million USD. The biggest takeaway from this, however, is that the size of the bluefin is not as important as its quality. When tuna auctioneers are inspecting a bluefin, they inspect a portion of the tail for fat content, color, shape, and the core. So, in a perfect scenario, if a 1000 lb bluefin was caught and sold at the beginning of the season, and it had the perfect sushi grade qualities, I believe it would easily go for 2 million USD. I believe the record at the moment is 1.5million."

AnglerPorn,38ssgr,RanOut_ofTalent,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:14:02 2015 UTC,can any recreational fisherman cash in on a fish they catch or do you need commercial licences and such?
AnglerPorn,38ssgr,YeahButGuys,2,Sun Jun 7 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"If you live in the states, the answer is no. Almost all states require a commercial fishing license to sell your catch. This is to prevent recreational fishing from becoming an unregulated, commercial concern. I highly recommend reading your country or states laws regarding the matter if you wish to do so. If you'd like a specific place, feel free to drop a reply and I'll help you out."

AnglerPorn,38spc6,spagettsmash,16,Sun Jun 7 05:59:19 2015 UTC,Ok gimme downvotes. I'll be that guy. First. I truly respect all fishermans rights to harvest what is legal. That said I'd like to start the conversation that there is simply no need to harvest a large Muskie like this. A replica can be done with pics and quick measurements. The meat is not desirable either on that old of a fish. In my opinion much better to release and let more people catch to help the sport.   Also something just looks funny here. One arm hold on this big of a fish. And the colors are extremely bright. Beautiful if real. Not sure it is ..

AnglerPorn,38spc6,radbrad7,3,Sat Jun 6 21:01:43 2015 UTC,First off this fish was hooked in the gills and didn't survive. She weighed in at 50.5 lbs and was 55 inches long. All of the pictures taken are from the local news so they shouldn't be shopped. This is Michigan's state record.
AnglerPorn,38spc6,omnipotent87,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"I figured it wasn't caught anywhere near Rapid City.  I happen to live in the area and there are very few muskies in our lakes, and none anywhere near this big. The state record is a 40lber and that was set in the early 90s.

AnglerPorn,38spc6,pronhaul2012,0,Sun Jun 7 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, should toss it back...but I'd get a ton of pics first.  Likely shopped for color, but he's using two hands, you can see his other hand wrapped around the one that's holding it up."

I recently saw a documentary on Netflix about there being so many dams in northwest that pretty much 90% of the wild salmon stock is gone over 100 years. Since building dams cuts off pathways to spawning locations. Not all dams had ladders and I learned more money is spent on artificial breeding of these salmon than it would cost to break down these old defunct dams that don't even generate more power than a single windmill.

AnglerPorn,38spx1,MishNchipz,3,Sat Jun 6 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Kinda yeah, sunfish variety. Usually caught in the same bodies of water as perch."

AnglerPorn,38spx1,MishNchipz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:52:51 2015 UTC,Nice... it looks like a fat perch :p
AnglerPorn,38spx1,eric22vhs,2,Sat Jun 6 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"At least in NJ we have tons of them, probably the most common sun fish, and basically the reason you step it up to larger lures so you can avoid them while fishing for bass or whatever else.  They do put up a big fight for their size though. If you get one larger than your hand it's pretty easy to think you've got a good size bass before you can see it."
AnglerPorn,38spx1,hipsterlureco,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:01:09 2015 UTC,"I used to avoid the hell out of sunnies because I fish for bass. But if you get a trout set-up with like 4lb test and catch big sunnies and bluegil it's a blast on a tiny trout rod. A good mix up to feel a good fight, and to see what kind of baitfish are in the area since it allows you to basically catch any fish."
AnglerPorn,38spx1,Annantrow,4,Sun Jun 7 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"That thing probably put up a hell of a fight. In my experience, a good size bluegill feels just as good as a good sized largemouth."
AnglerPorn,38spx1,eric22vhs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're a nuisance most of the time, but once they start getting  bigger than your hand they're a lot of fun. So long as they don't spike you."

AnglerPorn,38sr2e,hank_hiIl,8,Sat Jun 6 14:25:33 2015 UTC,Looking at that I'm scared that a gif is about to load and I'll see a man impaled...
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,fishslushy,8,Sat Jun 6 14:59:35 2015 UTC,I can't for the life of me figure out how he reeled that thing in on a kayak so small. Truly impressive.
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,QuapsyWigman,11,Sat Jun 6 16:07:42 2015 UTC,He didn't reel the fish in. He reeled himself to the fish!
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,Leakedd,4,Sat Jun 6 17:15:07 2015 UTC,...whoa
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,QuapsyWigman,3,Sat Jun 6 17:23:41 2015 UTC,I've been in a kayak before. I fell out trying to get on a dock. Without a big ass fish on the line
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,tsset,2,Sun Jun 7 02:46:49 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how an angler keeps his boat pointed towards the fish. Seems like of the line went perpendicular to the kayak it would tip him over.
AnglerPorn,38sr2e,meenster2008,3,Sun Jun 7 05:28:13 2015 UTC,If you didn't have your drag set properly it probably would.  If you kayak a lot you develop sort of an automatic balance.  You constantly adjust your weight and you don't even realize it unless you start thinking about it.  Plus a lot of kayaks these days are really stable considering how small they are.

AnglerPorn,38vosv,Johnjeeper5512,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:43:48 2015 UTC,Nice catch! I wish I had a good recipe for carp. They always tend to be a bit too fishy for my liking.
AnglerPorn,38spp4,hank_hiIl,2,Sat Jun 6 14:12:21 2015 UTC,So did you catch a walleye and the pike got it on the way in?
AnglerPorn,38spp4,NoUseForPants,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:15:59 2015 UTC,I think it was more like that caught a walleye and a pike and the the had an idea on the way in [to shore]
AnglerPorn,38srij,hank_hiIl,2,Sat Jun 6 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"I love roosterfish. You can catch these off the surf in Baja, MX"
AnglerPorn,38srij,divergentspectra,2,Sat Jun 6 17:10:32 2015 UTC,That is a killer looking fish! I'm sure that was a blast to catch!
AnglerPorn,38tl1d,winnsanity,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"For anyone who is interested, this particular trout gets its name from the red line running along its lower jaw giving it the appearance of having a slashed throat. They're really great for fly fishing!"
AnglerPorn,38tp3b,ChumbaJB,3,Sat Jun 6 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"Fascinating how it doesn't strike. I know it's brain is the size of a walnut, but I wonder if it's debating on whether the sick/dying fish is worth striking."
AnglerPorn,38tp3b,I_STAB_HIPSTER_FILTH,2,Sun Jun 7 04:31:20 2015 UTC,I know right?! Sat there contemplating for quite a while haha! She looks like she knows theres a hook waiting for her in that little dude but shes torn because shes so hungry
AnglerPorn,38u6mq,Flacid_Fun69,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:22:08 2015 UTC,Treble hook and bobber. Used a piece of sucker as bait
AnglerPorn,38u6mq,hank_hiIl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:51:03 2015 UTC,What did you catch it on?
AnglerPorn,38tn3s,Stonerallen420,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:43:13 2015 UTC,At a paylake in Columbus Ohio
AnglerPorn,38tn3s,ttjr89,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:43:28 2015 UTC,Hot damn that's a beauty
AnglerPorn,38ss4v,hank_hiIl,3,Sat Jun 6 14:35:28 2015 UTC,An they say dinosaurs and humans never lived together...
AnglerPorn,38ss4v,RanOut_ofTalent,2,Sat Jun 6 21:35:12 2015 UTC,Super impressive. Any backstory on this?
AnglerPorn,38ss4v,beholdkrakatow,3,Sat Jun 6 17:42:38 2015 UTC,That fish stole his wallet.

AnglerPorn,38ss4v,HOT_BLACK_CLAM,-1,Sun Jun 7 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, you shot it with a bow then dragged it's ass into your boat or towed it to land. Have some fucking respect for that animal."
AnglerPorn,38ss4v,Guitargeorgia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:38:21 2015 UTC,Not my picture. Pretty sure this guy ate the gar too.
AnglerPorn,38ss4v,HOT_BLACK_CLAM,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between what you are explaining and what hunters do to game? They shoot it, clean it and drag it to a vehicle to haul it home or to a processor. The government used underwater electric shocks to kill off thousands of these. Get respect from them. The man in this picture is following all ethical hunting/fishing game rules, unless you feel it's necessary to haul the gar in the boat with some sort of diamond studded, golden throne to make sure he abides by your standards of trash fish respect."
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,sadhandjobs,7,Sat Jun 6 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"Gar balls and gar patties are awesome! But really anything battered and fried is good...  Ol' Mrs Bessie used to make me some, she passed away about 5 years ago. Thank you for reminding me of her."
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Cajunether,3,Sun Jun 7 03:51:39 2015 UTC,not appetizing?
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,diditforda666,2,Sat Jun 6 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm unfair to the noble and hardy gar. It's like, I look at a gar and just have this feeling that they taste the way snakes smell."
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Chlothar,3,Sat Jun 6 16:47:36 2015 UTC,So you don't know if they're appetizing. You only know how they look?
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,dietstache,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"You're right, my bad. In my excitement to share my picture of the gar steaks I left out the word ""look"" in the title. It should say ""they look as appetizing as you'd expect"". And you're right, I have no idea how they taste, but, come on...it couldn't be good. Even their meat looks prehistoric.   I have a great affection for gar, truth be told. My dad used to take my sisters and me out to bayous and wiers to shoot gar. It's not the cuddly kind of affection, but, affection all the same. :)"
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,d_baum,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:35:06 2015 UTC,You've fished gar but never tasted it? I don't understand not eating fish that you kill/catch...
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Napkinsurgeon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:28:11 2015 UTC,It's not the best thing I do.
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,hipsterlureco,2,Sun Jun 7 03:51:42 2015 UTC,I always thought pike would be unpleasant but it was really good deep fried in some light batter.
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Captain_Cthulhu,2,Sat Jun 6 16:58:21 2015 UTC,When your out in the wild and have nothing but potatos to eat a 7 pound pike over a fire with butter is amazing.
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Captain_Cthulhu,2,Sat Jun 6 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, everything tastes really good deep fried in some light batter haha"
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Turdguzzler,2,Sun Jun 7 04:24:11 2015 UTC,I wanna try snake as well
AnglerPorn,38t1ot,Zogremite,3,Sat Jun 6 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with gar, are they good to eat?"
AnglerPorn,38sqxd,hank_hiIl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:24:10 2015 UTC,How much did that thing weigh?
AnglerPorn,38su9d,hank_hiIl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:55:11 2015 UTC,My favorite fish to eat!
AnglerPorn,38su9d,socialcancer,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:12:35 2015 UTC,Just watch out for the spikes. shudder
