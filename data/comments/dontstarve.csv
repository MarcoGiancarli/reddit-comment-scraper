Try playing as Wes, the mime! He’s not good at doing anything!""   Also, on the wiki:   Wes was introduced to the game to provide a challenge to experienced players. He has a maximum of 113 Health, 113 Hunger, and 150 Sanity, which drains faster than most Characters. He also deals less damage in both melee and ranged combat.   His entire design is to be weak.

Then the 2nd character, for cosmetic only, took me like 1 day of drawing and 1 day of coding and correct all my mistakes and error.  Every time I try something new, it takes me HOURS.
