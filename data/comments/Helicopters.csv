Helicopters,3e3wmw,thegreatshaft,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:23 2015 UTC,Gotta show off in front of those girls. They're all just lucky to still be alive and not maimed.
Helicopters,3e3wmw,Suhweetusername,7,Wed Jul 22 00:03:30 2015 UTC,Yeah you don't want to do that.
Helicopters,3e3wmw,GetOffMyLawn8,5,Tue Jul 21 22:16:07 2015 UTC,Can an American fill me on on the legality of this?  Single engine heli in Canada have to be gliding distance to shore.
Helicopters,3e3wmw,stephen1547,5,Tue Jul 21 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"Pilots are required to ""not endanger persons or property on the ground""  You decide if you'd like to argue with a judge after he or she viewed that video.   Also, no laws that I know of explicitly setting guidelines for glide distance to shorelines. I think Canada has their shit together a lot more with Helicopters than US does"
Helicopters,3e3wmw,jcav8r,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I always see videos of dudes flying low over water in light singles with no floats.  Not for me.  Even when I'm flying a 212, I still try to avoid extended flight over water, especially when I'm heavy."
Helicopters,3e3wmw,stephen1547,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've only flown Robbies and have had it drilled into me to never leave myself exposed over water without adequate glide to shore. You're generally still fucked, but at least you're fucked on or near land instead of water!"
Helicopters,3e3wmw,jcav8r,2,Tue Jul 21 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't want to auto to the water unless REALLY don't want to put it on the ground.  It's good practice to look down while flying and make mentally make notes of what you would do if the engine quit.  Maybe you have nothing by 100 ft cedar trees on the shore, and the water is 3 feet deep.  In that case, the water might be your best bet, but generally you want to land somewhere that if you do mess up the auto and roll it over, you won't drown."
Helicopters,3e3wmw,stephen1547,3,Wed Jul 22 00:04:07 2015 UTC,"That's the question I always ask:  Would you rather ditch in the water or in the trees? Picture coastal BC or slightly inland, with 100' trees, as you said, right to the shoreline, but let's assume the water is deep enough to require swimming?  Which would you chose? I get different answers from everyone. Personally, I think it would depend how cold the water looks :P"
Helicopters,3e3wmw,HeliBif,2,Wed Jul 22 01:25:52 2015 UTC,"Not a pilot, just a crew member here, but I thought somewhere in Part 135 it says for a single engine it has to have floats or at least life jackets for trips past gliding distance to shore. I think one of the bigger Air Medical companies got fined recently for that. Not sure about the other operating areas or for personally owned aircraft."
Helicopters,3e3wmw,medic3166,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"That's true, but they could be operating under 91. Maybe the swimmer is paying ""their pro rata share."""
Helicopters,3e3wmw,killerbeeman,4,Wed Jul 22 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"Well, technically we Canucks can be beyond gliding distance from shore so long as all persons on board have a life preserver within easy reach (actually, section 602.62 only says they need to be carried on board), and the random chic scrambling up the partially submerged landing gear had one so.... good to go? :D  Of course, 702/703 operators also have to be authorized in their ops manual, and be equipped with fixed or emergency floats (and have to be operated at an altitude where they can be deployed successfully), among other regs... and I feel like these dudes weren't participating in fire suppression or fish stocking ;)"

Helicopters,3dy54q,xenomorpheus,3,Mon Jul 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,I hope they don't try to do what Boeing did to MD.  Boeing couldn't sell off the civvie birds to Bell due to the FTC so they ended up selling it off after they took the AH-64 and NOTAR for their own.

As a military guy I use Avenza (free) for GEOTIFFs of 1:50K maps, but pretty much any GEOTIFF you can find you can use on it. If you're a military pilot, Avenza is clutch because you can do all of your routes and dog houses on Falconview and export it right to your tablet. Nothing like having a moving map with all of your route information already on it. No more expensive map markers for me!  AeroWx is another good one, it pulls the METARs and TAFs from nearby airports. I find it a faster way to check the wx than going on to Foreflight (and its free)  I use a logbook app thats specifically for Army aviators, but there are plenty of others out there for free or close to it. I like using an app because I would always forget to log in my paper logbook after a flight, but I always have my phone on me and usually have it out after a flight any way to call for gas. I always go back and log my flights on my Excel logbook and email it to myself so it exists in the tubes, but its nice to have a (free) backup.

Please be aware though that if you do go with Freflight and apple, be SURE that your mini has GPS capability. That means that it has something that looks like a different color strip on the top and can be connected to a phone plan. What you do is buy it then just don't pay for the phone plan, but that's the only one that will give you gps.

Helicopters,3d1fr9,celocopter,9,Sun Jul 12 19:03:10 2015 UTC,"Friction is your friend. You can't try to counter every little gust in a 407 or you'll end up over controlling. Friction will keep your hand from unintentionally moving the cyclic in any kind of minor turbulence. Also, the cyclic works best with only fine, deliberate movements - it is very sensitive. Accuracy is important. You can't hunt around or the ship will be all over the place.  Avoid very low torque (<10% torque) if you can. If you do end up with torque that low, be very careful pulling back up on the collective as you can cause an NP overspeed pretty easily. I try to just keep the torque above 10% at all times and that seems to work for me.  The 407 almost feels like it is constantly encouraging you to do everything fast, so you have to consciously slow yourself down. Or maybe that's just me. Basically, it will do everything you tell it to and it will do it right now. It makes for a very fun machine to fly, but can get you in trouble fast.  ... Enjoy yourself :)"
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,2,Sun Jul 12 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Got 2 flights in now! Nothing super complicated, we didn't get into any low torque situations or high weight but I'll remember this for next time.  You weren't kidding about the frictions. The stick didn't feel too bad, but we had a calm day, how's it fly in turbulence/winds? Collective, though, damn, we had the friction on the entire time. Even a little pressure made a massive change. I'm used to wrestling with my school's 22, that will be a hard habit to break. Set downs were especially brutal for that.  It definitely felt like it pushed for speed in all maneuvers, you're not alone there. It almost flew itself... once we set the power, got our altitude, that was that.  What a machine. Looking forward to flying it again soon hopefully!"
Helicopters,3d1fr9,zippyajohn,2,Mon Jul 13 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"Also the low torque will fuck you on approach if you are heavy and in turbulent conditions its easy to over torque, especially if you're flying a GX model. For some reason it seems like the GX is more power limiting."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:29:15 2015 UTC,"You can get bounced around a bit in turbulence and high wind, but you really just have to let the wind do it's thing and try not to counter every brief change in attitude from gusts. It actually flies very nice in the wind from my experience - I feel like you can feel out the wind really well once you get used to the rotor system.   Not moving the cyclic too much is a great habit to form, whether you are flying a 22 or 407. The thing is that the 22 will be vastly more forgiving with overcontrolling, so it's easy to get used to making lots of unnecessary movements because the aircraft will still fly relatively smoothly. 407 not so much.  Anyway, sounds like you had fun. It's my favorite aircraft so far :) Hope you get more stick time too."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,Cropgun,0,Mon Jul 13 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"Frictions are okay to use, but remember that they are more of a crutch.  Friction will help you at first and hinder you later.  One of the benefits of ""real"" helicopters is that those super sensitive cyclics can really help you master the machine.  Sometimes you'll need to move the machine just a hair, and without friction, all you really have to do is think about moving the helicopter and it will move.  Whereas if you're still using friction, you're going to have to overcome the friction you've applied to the cyclic before it will move.  I feel like I worded that poorly, but I can't currently find better words.   edit:  Frictions will keep you from over controlling at first, and cause you to over control later.  Especially when you decide you're ready for no friction.  I personally would recommend leaving them off until you get the feel for it."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,zippyajohn,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've never had to cg problems laterally.

Then again I usually fly with passengers sitting in the left and right seats, never all on one side."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,3,Mon Jul 13 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"This might be something to do with having a basket on the right side more than anything, but the cg effect of the basket is way more pronounced on a 407 vs a 206L with a basket, but not necessarily in a hover or just forward flight. I seem to encounter the effect most often in a descending right turn with a low power setting. Not sure why it's like that."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,zippyajohn,3,Mon Jul 13 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"the 407's cyclic is way more responsive than the 22 so be careful about over controlling. Other than that, just fly the machine. You're over thinking it."

Helicopters,3d1fr9,zippyajohn,2,Sun Jul 12 19:32:01 2015 UTC,I haven't flown the astar before but the pilots I know who have flown both prefer the 407. Apparently its smoother and easier to fly. Personally I love the 407. Tons of power and super reliable.

I suspected that with the 105 (that's the model redbull uses, correct?), but didn't think there were that many rigid systems out there.   I know 206s and UH-60s. Other than that, I'm fairly ignorant of other aircraft systems."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"I think they may become more common with the advent of newer and more improved composite technology. It's really a no brainer - less moving parts = better, right? (Probably not that simple, but still). The BO105 has a grand total of zero rotor system failures in its entire operational life of 6 million hours. Not bad."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,CrashSlow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"The 135 blades do lead lag,  its just the spar inside the blade that does all the flexing.  Its not really a rigid system."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:47:37 2015 UTC,"Of course, it has to lead and lag, as well as flap. All rigid rotor systems do, it's just accomplished through flexing instead of a bearing mechanism. It is still considered rigid."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,Astherotorturns,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:53 2015 UTC,The EC135 main rotors are mainly known as bearingless rotors. The Bell 430 and H-1 use a similar setup as does the MD 900 series. Very good system but the flexbeams (or yokes if you work on Bells) are very expensive to fabricate.
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"That doesnt make any sense. The blades don't come along and get an input at a certain point in the rotation cycle, the changes are continuous around the plane of rotation and act immediately through the swashplate/pitch links. The delay (lag) is due to the phase lag of the system which is based on a number of factors like rotor system ridigity, blade aerodynamics, rotor speed, rotor diameter, etc."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,Cropgun,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"Well, yes they do.  It seems like you know what forces are acting on the rotor blades, but do not understand how they actually work.  The blades do not immediately deflect to the requested position.  The swash plate is fixed.  It does not chase the blades around waiting for the pilot to give it a command so that it can immediately give each pitch link a command simultaneously.  You only get maximum deflection at two points in the plane of rotation.  This is Gyroscopic precession.    In a two bladed system you have two pitch links.  You must wait for the pitch link to reach the point of maximum deflection as it travels around the swash plate and takes input from it.  You get the desired result x* later.  This is phase lag.    Next time you've got a 206 outside and some time, give it maximum cyclic input any direction you like, and spin the blades slowly by turning the tail rotor.  You can actually see this happening and how the blades behave.  A 4 bladed system is more responsive (generally speaking) because you have double the amount of blades and double the amount of pitch links taking input from the swash plate and introducing them to the rotor disc, you simply do not have to wait as long to get what you want and it takes less of an input to effect significant change in the rotor disc.  Clear as mud? :)"

I wasn't suggesting the blades deflect instantaneously, I was referring to the fact that the swashplate transmits changes to cyclic pitch up to the rotor head continuously, and is rigged such that the blades have time to fly into their new position, changing the angle of the disc (and thus the direction of the thrust vector).   The rigging is set up so that the maximum blade pitch occurs a certain number of degrees before the maximum deflection of the blade, so pushing up on the cyclic makes the nose go down. This is the phase angle - which is what compensates for aerodynamic precession. There is effectively no such thing as gyroscopic precession in a rotor system. That's a simplified explanation you find in old textbooks that is in fact not true to the actual forces at play.   The speed at which the blades are able to fly into position (thus changing the angle of the disc) determines the perceived ""responsiveness"" of the cyclic."
Helicopters,3d1fr9,Cropgun,0,Mon Jul 13 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't suggesting the blades deflect instantaneously   Yes you did.  The bolded parts are incorrect.   The blades don't come along and get an input at a certain point in the rotation cycle, the changes are continuous around the plane of rotation and act immediately through the swashplate/pitch links.   Go look at a parked 206.  With the blades running front to back in line with the fuselage, push the cyclic forward.  The pitch of the blades will not change at all.  Now push the cyclic left or right.  The pitch changes to full deflection.  There is not an immediate effect on the rotor disc.  You must wait for the blade and its pitch link to come along and take input from the swash plate.   The rigging is set up so that the maximum blade pitch occurs a certain number of degrees before the maximum deflection of the blade, so pushing up on the cyclic makes the nose go down. This is the phase angle - which is what compensates for aerodynamic precession. There is effectively no such thing as gyroscopic precession in a rotor system. That's a simplified explanation you find in old textbooks that is in fact not true to the actual forces at play.   We agree on all of this ^  Which is why I am now confused as to why you were disagreeing with me earlier.   The speed at which the blades are able to fly into position (thus changing the angle of the disc) determines the perceived ""responsiveness"" of the cyclic.   Which is exactly what I have been saying.  The discussion was about the increased responsiveness in a 407 vs. the r22 the OP is used to flying.  The 407 has double the amount of blades.  Therefore effectively doubling the speed at which a blade comes along to take input from the swash plate.  You are not wrong in saying that blade speed effects responsiveness, but blade speeds really don't vary widely.  And in an apples to apples comparison (4 bladed rotor system vs 4 bladed rotor system), it'd be pretty difficult for somebody to detect a small difference in rotor rpm.  In an apples to oranges (4 blades vs 2) its quite easy because now you are only waiting for 90* of rotation instead of 180*  I think you're thinking about what I said too hard.  :)"
Helicopters,3d1fr9,deadcom,0,Tue Jul 14 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"Yes you did:   I am saying there that the changes in the swashplate translate to changes in pitch in the blades immediately... that is not something you can contend, it is the mechanical truth. It takes time for this change in pitch to change the angle of the rotor disc (aerodynamic precession).    Go look at a parked 206. With the blades running front to back in line with the fuselage, push the cyclic forward. The pitch of the blades will not change at all. Now push the cyclic left or right. The pitch changes to full deflection. There is not an immediate effect on the rotor disc. You must wait for the blade and its pitch link to come along and take input from the swash plate.   Yes, the 206 has close to a 90 degree phase angle...   Not all rotor systems are 90 degrees. They vary widely... the R22 is 72 degrees, an S76 is 57 degrees. I'm not sure what the 407 is, but I would bet it is somewhere in the neighborhood of the S76.  This angle translates effectively to the amount of time it takes for the blade to fly into it's new tip path plane. the smaller the number, the faster, and the more responsive the rotor system. The RAH66 Comanche is another good example. It's phase angle was down in the 30's IIRC.   I think you're thinking about what I said too hard. :)   I think you're giving yourself too much credit"

Helicopters,3cykqs,USCAV19D,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Aside from flares or evasive maneuvering their are also Infrared Counter Measure systems (IRCM) and Direct (or directional) Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM). These are mostly passive systems activated by the aircraft's missile detection system. Since missile systems like this track to their targets by using a sensor or ""eye"" to detect large sources of infrared radiation, and adjust their flight path to intercept it, altering the location of that signal can throw-off the missile. IRCM systems have a ""lamp"" that pulses a high intensity IR signal. This overwhelms the missiles sensor and causes it to wobble around, and since the field of view of the sensor is very narrow (only a few degrees) this can break the lock on the target. A drawback of this system is that it lights up the aircraft like a Christmas tree in the IR spectrum. DIRCM's don't have this issue because instead of a pulsing field of IR they use a beam directed at the missile, but other than that the systems are very similar."

Your DPE for the checkride will almost certainly grill you on knowledge of these things.  You've stated you have a hard time locating some landmarks in the air. From my personal experiences on cross-country flights, using towers should be coupled with other landmarks unless it's very obvious. I find Google Earth to be helpful in getting an idea how noticeable landmarks might be from above if there's any question.  If you plan to go past your PPL, be prepared to do lots of flight planning.

I mark my checkpoints with ""X"" and highlight my route of flight on my sectional, helps me easily glance down and see where I am.  I also calculate the time between each checkpoint and have a stopwatch clipped on to my knee board.   Every time I pass a checkpoint I restart my timer. (or make a mental note of what time I passed the checkpoint at)  To find where I am is simple:    I already know I'm between checkpoint 3 and checkpoint 4.  And I know it will be about 10 minutes of flying at cruise speed to fly from point 3 to point 4.  And I know that I have been flying for 3 minutes since I passed checkpoint 3.   So were am I? about 1/3 of the way between checkpoint 3 and checkpoint 4. With my route highlighted I can ""put my finger"" on that spot almost instantly.  Once you know where you are just use your common sense, set your radio to the nearest airport freq for example.  Extra free tips:   Do NOT use towers as checkpoints for all the reasons you said yourself and the fact that they will kill you if you accidentally fly into it. Put away foreflight, skyvector etc until you already have your private pilots certificate. Then for private use, commercial training etc sure save yourself some time and effort.

This way you'll know what 5 miles is so that when you spot the Class D airport you can call tower in time before you enter their airspace.

Helicopters,3cqpj6,Apocraphon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:51:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw in a contrary opinion. I started on helicopters recreationally, but have have since moved to fixed wing flying. They are more similar than different in forward flight. While light helicopters are more hands-on than light planes (You can't trim an R22), I wouldn't necessarily call the mechanical skills much more difficult. They're just different. You start getting into complex (special to helicopter) stuff: off airport pinnacle landings, confined space takeoff/landing etc it can be incredibly rewarding to do. It's always fun (except when it's terrifying).  I enjoy planes enough to switch. For me they are 96% of the fun for half the price. There are challenging types of fixed-wing flying too. I'd love to learn tail-wheel flying sometime, or aerobatic work. It all depends on how you fly.  Go get an intro helicopter flight sometime. It should be pretty obvious if you like it or not. (Seriously though, don't. You will like it, and then be out millions of pennies)"
Helicopters,3cqpj6,Exalted_Leader_Morse,3,Fri Jul 10 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm just cruising in on helicopters for a quick peek. But I'm a fixed with guy with tailwheel. From the very limited stuff I've read in this thread you guys seem like you would love tailwheel.   It's fucking nuts... when you three point a landing and suddenly all the rules don't apply anymore it gets your heart rate up.   As far as fixed wing, I enjoy two things the most... I love landing. That feeling of getting it just right and showing up a captain has no equal.   The other thing I love is shooting an approach to minimums. Depending on how fast you're going there can be seconds in it and there's just nothing I've come across quite like it. Anyway, just my 2 cents from an aviation subreddit wanderer."

Helicopters,3cjz5n,Craigox27,5,Wed Jul 8 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"#1 is correct. The gearbox has two output shafts spinning in opposite directions. Well, not between the rotors, but the bottom rotor shaft is hollow and the top shaft runs through the center.  Basically you have one gear as an input at 90° from the rotor shaft. One shaft will connect to the gear on the bottom, while the other shaft connects on the top, making the spin opposite. Kinda hard to explain, but it works very similar to a car differential.

Helicopters,3cczys,super-nemo,3,Wed Jul 8 06:29:38 2015 UTC,"So you're a sophomore in high school. No plans are set. When I was your age 3 years ago I wanted to go to west point. Then junior year rolled around and I wanted to be a civil engineer that worked on dams. At the end of junior year that's when I wanted to become a pilot. I started looking at the military to see what I wanted to do. If you keep going on the path of wanting to fly helicopters you'll have to decide what you want to do.   You can go to college and try to get your private licence and then eventually a commercial license. That's an expensive route. But it keeps you out of the military. But what if you did want to join the military? There are TONS of ways to get to fly.   First you'll have to look at what branch of the military you would be interested in. You said you don't want extreme workouts and you don't want to get shot at. (no body going into aviation does) I would recommend the Navy or Coast Guard.   It is very unlikely to see combat in either of those branches. And their PT standards are a little more lax compared to the Army and Marine Corps. If you wanted to fly for those branches you would have to get your bachelors degree and get into an officer commissioning program. That's something like ROTC, OCS, USNA, or the USCGA. If you go to ROTC the USNA or the USCGA you'll have a higher chance of commissioning in aviation. And the you can get your degree with little to no money out of pocket. If you go to an academy you'll actually get paid to go to college.   In the military you'll get to do things civilians won't be able to do. You'll get flight plenty of flight hours and you can do some cool things. Out of the routs I told you about I would personally choose the coast guard over the Navy. You'll be stateside for the majority of your career and will actually make a difference in people's lives. SAR is some cool stuff.   If you change your mind about the don't want to get shot at thing and you don't mind working out I can do nothing but recommend the Army. They are the largest rotary wing force in the country. They deploy a more. (The Army is flying the majority of missions in Afghanistan and Iraq) They have many different helicopters with different roles. And there is more opportunities to fly for a career.   As a commissioned officer you'll eventually have to step into an administrative role as you progress in rank. The Army has an option that allows you to fly without commissioning as a lieutenant. You can become a warrant officer. (my personal favorite route into an aviation career ) Warrant officers primary job is to fly. Well 153 series WOs  anyways. They are respected experts in the Army and fly the majority of birds the Army has.   In order to become a warrant officer you can go to college and try to get in as a civilian. (street to seat) Or you can enlist and try to become a warrant officer while you're in the Army. A cool thing about WOFT is that you dont need a college degree to get in. However it is highly encouraged to have one especially if you are trying to get in as a civilian. There is no prior flight experience needed but that is helpful as well.   If you have questions about Army aviation go ahead and ask it. That's where the majority of my knowledge is focused. I wouldn't know much about civilian flying but this subreddit is filled  with civilian pilots."

Helicopters,3cczys,SeraphTwo,2,Wed Jul 15 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Real talk: the training that will allow you to fly a helicopter professionally will cost you around $100,000. There is (almost) no way around this if you don't want to join the armed forces.  You can either take on student loans for this or save it up. Your choice. If you're taking on student loans, you better have a backup plan in case you don't make it as a pilot but are still saddled with the debt. That means getting a degree in something marketable. the STEM fields are an excellent choice. If you plan on saving up the money, you need a well-paying job to do that. So again, you'll need a degree in something people will hire you for.   In the end, the only sane way to go about becoming a professional helicopter pilot is to get a proper degree (not some communications or english lit bullshit), then pursue flight training. At least that gives you a backup plan if things go sour."

Helicopters,3cczys,Paranoma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:42:54 2015 UTC,The entire cost of training should be between $60-$80k and not a penny more.  Many school are overcharging their students; I advise everyone to take a look around the country and find the good ones.
Helicopters,3cczys,alienboob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"Costs for training are probably the biggest hurdle you'll face, as others have stated here. Becoming a pilot in the military isn't the only ""military"" option to get there. The majority of the helicopter students I go to school with are former military, using their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay for training. A short stint in the military might not be the most appealing thing, but at least you'd have access to this option (assuming congress hasn't severely hindered funding for flight students by then).  Of course the other way of funding your aspiration is to get a loan. There are several colleges around the US who partner with local flight schools to offer degree programs in conjunction with getting your various licenses. My first instructor had gone this route, and he was able to secure a loan from Wells Fargo to pay for the training and college courses.  My recommendation, if available in your area, would be to take a demo flight at a school that provides helicopter training. It should give you a snapshot of what awaits, as well as a jolt of motivation. They should also be able to answer any questions you have."

I went to school, got my A&P, got a job with a heli tack company for the fire season  and granted I am not building hours quickly, the networking is huge. The plan is to try and find a school that needs a wrench. Once your working for a school, your getting in on mantienience flights, ferry flights, reduced hourly rates and makes it much more obtainable..  I wouldn't take out a loan for 80k for flying..  But a 40k loan is within reason for me.   Plus you have a good job to fall back on should you loose medical clearance or if you ever can't find pilot work..  Not to mention, you have a much better understanding of the machines your flying as well."
Helicopters,3cczys,secretgspot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"Like you, I had to tackle the finances of training alone. The good news is licenses don't expire. You have lots of time. Be patient and make a good budget, and consider looking into a Part 61 school to ""pay as you go"".  Alternatively some flight schools are associated with community colleges, so you'll be able to apply for a student loan to help with the associated costs and keep flying a priority. I believe Cloud 9 has a program like this, among others. Call around and talk to people about your options."
Helicopters,3cczys,Paranoma,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:44:27 2015 UTC,LOL!  You should read faa site on regulations regarding license requirements and insurance.  25000 will probably get you to your private license just barely but you'll be no way ready to be flying with passengers.  you might want to look into helicopter kits and try so save up for that.   But it might be expensive too.   To operate an R22 it cost something like $70/hour .  Engine has to be rebuilt every 2000 hours and that cost 2/3 of the helicopter price.

Helicopters,3bddl9,HeliBif,2,Mon Jun 29 07:21:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I mean :) lazy governor. Especially annoying in days like we've had in BC lately with all the heat and convective activity.

Helicopters,3bddl9,HeliBif,3,Mon Jun 29 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"It's really not that hard to get used to and the counter argument has always been than it teaches you, instinctively, about rotor RPM control. If there is any issue, it's when a student pilot is also a motorcycle rider, because at some point they are going to roll the throttle the wrong way. This applies to any helicopter throttle on a collective though as far as I know."
Helicopters,3bddl9,TurdFlight85,2,Sun Jun 28 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"I learned on an R22 that didn't even have a governor. It was all manual. Pull power, roll on throttle. Lower the collective, roll off a little."
Helicopters,3bddl9,iamkokonutz,3,Sun Jun 28 07:45:54 2015 UTC,"Governor off flight in the R22 reveals some interesting caveats about the mechanical correlator on that model. While helpful, it's calibrated for cruise, and tends to overcorrect in the hover (made even more noticeable because of the low inertia rotor system). This equates to raise collective = roll off, lower collective = roll on when hovering. Completely counter-intuitive and takes some getting used to."
Helicopters,3bddl9,Knight_Doppler,2,Sun Jun 28 09:50:10 2015 UTC,"I think that's true for the 300 as well, you really have to watch the throttle on ascend/descend"
Helicopters,3bddl9,deadcom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Learning on the 300 was great. I always had trouble keeping the RPM in the green (didn't fair well in that area on the flight test), however, I found it useful to have the skill of manipulating the throttle when learning to fly the 407 with a ""failed"" fadec (manual mode). Also jumping from the 300 to 206 made the 206 seem so much easier to fly in a lot of ways. The only downside to a governor, at least on the jetranger, is it can be slower than you at making required changes, making descents take longer than they could be at times."
Helicopters,3bddl9,SeafoodGumbo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:41:55 2015 UTC,"What is a correlator?  I learned to fly in a 300 and we had George, a governor that would kick back the throttle when you came close to red line for rotor or engine RPM."
Helicopters,3bddl9,SeafoodGumbo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"the it's basically an open-loop system that increases throttle with increased collective. That being said, since it's not closed-loop, it requires pilot adjustment on the throttle to keep RPMs in the green sometimes."
Helicopters,3bddl9,achwas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"It has been since 1985 that I flew one.  After learning in that I went on to turbines with a fuel control.  I am sure we had a correlator on the old 300's because it wasn't that hard as far as I remember, to keep the rotor in the green with just the throttle."
Helicopters,3bddl9,JDepinet,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"The correlator is just a mechanical linkage that opens the throttle roughly corresponding to collective inputs, saving you from having to twist the grip a bunch. Almost all pistons have this.  What you are decribing is an RPM limiter"
Helicopters,3bddl9,Cropgun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"the 300 is designed to be used as it is, so its built well to accommodate the needs of manual control.  the Robbies have the gov, but you have to train for it's failure, and they are NOT designed for ease of manual control.  so its sort of a toss up, both systems have theoretical drawbacks, both are acceptable and commonly used trainers despite their differences.  TL;DR stop whining about the differences and just learn the aircraft, every single machine has its idiosyncrasies."
Helicopters,3bddl9,achwas,-1,Sun Jun 28 06:19:43 2015 UTC,if you come out of flight school not knowing how to work a throttle you've been severely misguided.  Throttle management and knowing what the helicopter is going to do because of throttle inputs and having the trained muscle memory to use that to your advantage is a valuable skill that robbie pilots will never learn.  It could save your life one day.  Governors are bullshit for student pilots.
Helicopters,3bddl9,deadcom,3,Sun Jun 28 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"The worst part about governors is that a lot of students (taught by shitty instructors) have no understanding of what ""full throttle"" means. They never had to manually twist the throttle, other than 0.5h of ""governor off"" training, so the fact that there is a maximum amount of throttle doesn't really cross their mind.  So one day they are at high altitude. MAP is well below red line so they aren't even worried. They don't know how close they are to full throttle, since the governor is taking care of the grip for them. And then they pull a little too much, lights and music start, and now they don't know what is happening, or what to do. So they stall the thing right into the ground. Dozens of videos on youtube of that exact thing happening."

Section 3.2.3 has some more guff but I can't work out what forward velocity mu relates so if it's really small then this is a moot point.

Helicopters,3b13uf,GoneViking,3,Thu Jun 25 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"Have you ever tried doing an autorotation in a 206 where you come into the flare fast and draw the flare out while in ground effect for a few hundred feet? You definitely can have ground effect with forward movement.   That's an extreme example, but an everyday example would be simply departing - if you stay close to the ground, the ground effect will allow take off with less power than trying the do the same take off OGE."
Helicopters,3b13uf,deadcom,2,Thu Jun 25 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"You might be right. Still, Ground effect is at maximum over flat hard surface, not very effective over water"

Many servicemen will tell you that their time spent in the military was the best time ever that they would never want to do again. The military is not for the faint of heart. Between 7 month long deployments, multi week training exercises away from home, and a constantly high operational tempo there's not a whole lot of time for a normal/family life. I am unbelievably proud of the things I did and the people I got to serve alongside, but after my 5 year enlistment, I chose to be done with the lifestyle and never looked back. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything, and if me of today could talk to me of 5 1/2 years ago I would still say 100% to do it. Hope that clears up what I meant!"

Helicopters,3b1397,TheTexanPilot,3,Thu Jun 25 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"If you're overshooting, you're going to fast. Slow down, way down. In Canada, you'll never fail a ride for going a little too slow on an approach. Having to overshoot because you were going too fast makes it look like you're out of control, which may not go over great on a check ride.  My mentor showed me a neat trick for slowing down on a circling approach. Flare. Now most customers, bosses, and check pilots do not like big flares. It's makes them nervous. On a circling approach however, flaring in a turn barely noticeable. That was his trick. Flare off the speed in the turn. It worked well to hide the fact that I had messed up and was going too fast.  While you're learning, it's always better to take it slow. Over time as you gain experience, it will become a lot easier.  Good Luck!"
Helicopters,3b1397,littlebluetruck,2,Thu Jun 25 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"I visualise my curved glide path all the way to the aiming point. It works for both straight in and curved approaches - visualise a line connecting your aircraft to your aiming point, then fly down it. Adjust rate of closure just as you would for a straight in approach, use collective for height and cyclic for speed adjustment. Your scan should include both your aiming point for judging the approach, and straight ahead for maintaining or correcting the pitch and roll.   As for scenario training, I'm a big fan of visualisation. Come up with a scenario, then visualise every aspect of the flight in as much detail as possible including radio calls, checklists, flight profiles etc. I usually try to do this in bed the night before a check flight, but you can do it sitting in the aircraft in the hangar for extra realism."
Helicopters,3b1397,Yara-ma-yha-who,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, you sound like you are paying to much attention to the instruments. Just glance at them occasional but primarily focus on your landing spot out the window and use your peripheral vision to judge speed and descent rates, anticipate that you will slow through ETL at a certain point and have the power ready for that. That said, scenario training can be good but if it's not in the PTS you are probably wasting your time/money as far as preparing for a check ride is concerned. I'm not saying this is the case, but there are instructors that think they are doing you a favor by showing you how commercial work is actually done and that can get you a checkride failure. In my experience, the DPE wants to see you do the same crap as the PPL ride but with tighter standards and more knowledge. You also need to consider whether or not your CFI has done any significant amount of non-CFI commercial work or they are just experimenting with you... it does happen."
Helicopters,3b1397,TurdFlight85,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"All our flights are done to pts standards. Manuevers are always done to pts and if they aren't we redo the manuever.

Helicopters,3b1397,secretgspot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:28:29 2015 UTC,I've also started working on using the peripheral vision to judge airspeed more especially on approaches that aren't straight on. It is something my instructor mentioned also a couple flights ago.
Helicopters,3b1397,secretgspot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:30:53 2015 UTC,you need to play some helicopter video games and as most realistic simulator as possible and do the most extreme cases which you would never attempt in real situation.  You'll be able to see true limitations and things to do in those situations.  Also taking some times off to process will clear a lot of things.   Take a 2-4 week vacation and after you come back you'll have a new perspective on the whole thing.   On the sidenote; what are your plans after you get your CPL?    how much are you paying per hour? what are you training on mostly? how many hours are you required to do?

Helicopters,3azh92,zippyajohn,3,Wed Jun 24 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Can't see anyone replacing a 1978 Long ranger with a 20 million dollar drone to sling shit around the bush up here, for example.  However, drones for things like aerial surveillance are already cheap, and they are taking away chunks of the traditional low-timer job market already. The days where you were be able to build your first 1000h flying pipeline patrols will soon be over. That would be my concern if I was just starting out. Maybe not yet, but a few years down the line for sure."
Helicopters,3azh92,achwas,3,Wed Jun 24 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"A drone capable of pipeline parol,  only a government with a massive military industrial complex could afford. Whats a 407 drone worth??? An r22 is cheap and a low timer is even cheaper.   The only thing drones have really replace are jibs and cranes on movie sets.    Shots you couldn't have gotten with a heli anyway.    Realestate pics,  sure.  I bet nobody was making a living off those anyway.     Maybe the US military will give old reaper drones to law enforcement for urban surveillance,,,,,, or maybe its already happened."
Helicopters,3azh92,CrashSlow,3,Wed Jun 24 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"You are thinking of a 500 mile cross country pipeline that requires the range of a full size helicopter. A lot of the stuff we do up here is a lot smaller scale, and if the oil and gas company had a few drones even with just 5 mile range at their disposal that they can drive around in the back of an f150, I think they'd take over a fair chunk of this work. In fact I have flown into sites this year where I was advised to watch out for a drone below 400ft patrolling local lines. And I bet a lot of the long distance stuff could be broken into smaller segments that get worked by drones on a more regular basis, rather than doing a biannual fly over in a $1500/hr helicopter.  All I know for sure is, never bet against technology.. If there is money to be made, somebody will design a machine that can do the job."

Insurance will say we will not insure any humans to do wire testing or tree slinging jobs since they have the most accidents in the last decade.    Besides, I rather invest 1 million into a robot and have it work itself non-stop and without any errors or demands and pay itself off in few years than have a human that constantly sick and is controlled by emotions."
Helicopters,3azh92,secretgspot,-3,Wed Jun 24 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"I see a realistic job for a helicopter pilot in the future being one where he flies a drone 50 miles into the bush, and spends 4 or 5 hours piloting the drone for timber survey, then flying the drone back to base. It will be a long time before they allow complete autonomous    operation. There will need to be a pilot in sight of the drone at all times with a valid radio license. Makes sense to use a helicopter pilot to handle the whole operation."
Helicopters,3azh92,iamkokonutz,4,Wed Jun 24 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I see this up here already, except the drone usually travels to the location in a truck if possible. But I have taken drone operators to locations as well, and sat there waiting while they did the aerial survey part with a drone rather than by hand out of the helicopter.  The legislation around drones isn't finalized yet, but I don't think the operators- or radio license will be enough of an obstacle to require helicopter pilots to do these jobs.  Another example is a lot of the fire fighting that goes on. Drones may not replace the water bombers or the aircraft moving the crews, but they will be utilized for things like IR scanning probably very soon. If each squad of firefighters had a small remote controlled drone in a pelican case, to get an overview of their surroundings if needed, they would be much more efficient than with the current method of relying on a helicopter overhead to relay information to each team. My guess is that this will become the norm within 5 years at best."
Helicopters,3azh92,achwas,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"What I am thinking is helicopter companies will probably become Helicopter/Drone companies to compete. Having the entire regulatory structure in place gives them a real leg up on joe schmo drone operator who applies for an SFOC.  I know Lidar and such is increasingly going to drone. My thinking the ability to combine the remote location access of a helicopter with the cost savings of drones could make a really lucrative business opportunity for operators who jump aboard early.  But yeah, your assessment seems bang on."
Helicopters,3azh92,iamkokonutz,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, the smart companies should definitely be looking into this right now. I know at least one company in Australia that has done it successfully for their aerial real estate photography business."

The CH-47F will enter Block 2 and the UH-60 will probably be finishing the V model upgrades from L/M.  So in 10-15 years, those helicopters will likely be very similar to today.

Helicopters,3b3f6w,Aussie_chopperpilot,2,Fri Jun 26 07:10:47 2015 UTC,"That is the aerodynamic phase lag and is compensated for with what's called the gamma angle. Nothing to do with gyro physics. It's almost never 90 degrees. Gyroscopic precession affecting rotor systems is something that should never be taught because it's simply false.  You're right that it's important to understand the aerodynamic lag, but it's also pretty intuitive.

Helicopters,3b3f6w,Aussie_chopperpilot,2,Fri Jun 26 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"GP always happens at exactly 90 degrees, which is why it's incorrect to attribute the effect to helicopter rotor systems since the APL is never exactly 90 degrees. APL is the time it takes (distance around the plane of rotation in degrees) for a change in cyclic pitch to change the angle of the rotor disc. Some systems are as low as 30 degrees.

Helicopters,3asjup,Av619,2,Tue Jun 23 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Firstly I would not go near a plane, you will need the 200 total time anyways. Secondly make sure your schools simulator is up to par, they just updated the regulations regarding sims and FTDs and I don't think you can count up to 20 anymore.   You are going to need some 44 time eventually, that being said you only really need 25, maybe check the regs and do what you can in the sim and the rest in the 44. You could always come up to Washington where 44 dual is $470.  I personally wouldn't do instrument in a 22, the minimum fuel capacity and high altitudes just scream sketchy to me.   Keep in mind instrument can be challenging, and it takes many people longer than minimums to get a solid hold of it."
Helicopters,3asjup,Paperplains,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:22:24 2015 UTC,I'm scared of flying instrument in the sim for a few weeks and not flying in the real deal and slowly loosing the touch.   And if I do the sim that is a different school ...   I would like to finish up the time in the air with my current school although I'm unsure how that transition would go so they are not teaching me what I already learned in a sim.
Helicopters,3asjup,Paperplains,2,Tue Jun 23 04:31:22 2015 UTC,"Flying is like riding a bike, it comes back. And it probably wouldn't be too bad a transition, schools are usually used to getting halfway trained people, you might do one flight to see what you already know and then continue one."

Helicopters,3ap774,_WonderBeard_,3,Mon Jun 22 15:23:46 2015 UTC,Most maintenance schedules are based on multiple smaller inspections and one or two major inspections at specified intervals i.e... 100hr 1200hr 2400hr  the downside is when you reach a larger inspection interval the machine needs to be brought out of service for a longer period of time.   The 135 has 20 consecutive inspections each with a 50 hour window to complete. This allows maintenance personnel to complete each of the smaller inspections in the normal downtimes. Thus the machine can be operational more and make more $$$$$

Helicopters,39gbu0,tomtomx2,4,Thu Jun 11 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"Simply log the time as simulator time, not as aircraft time.  Under aircraft type you would put the sim type (I don't have my Army logbook on me right now, so I can't tell you the actual designator).  For the tailnumber, put the sim serial number.  You can have your IP sign the logbook if you like, but since it really isn't relevant towards an FAA rating it's not a big deal if you don't (getting your Comm/Inst ticket is based on completing Primary and Instruments, not based on time)."
Helicopters,39gbu0,pseudo_noob,2,Thu Jun 11 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Your Primary time should be logged as Rotary, DUAL RECEIVED, Day; you're not eligible to log SIC time until fully qualified on the airframe being flown that day. The exception to that is on solo day, when you can log PIC time for your right-seat time, sans-IP. For Instruments, I logged Ground Trainer and Instrument Approaches, but no actual time. This was the best advice I could get from my IP, as no one (even at Rucker) seems to know the full details regarding the DOD/FAA agreement that governs our flight hours. That said, all the DA759's look identical coming out of the schoolhouse, so this is probably the one time you can trust the Army to get your hours right."
Helicopters,39gbu0,wiredpilot12,2,Thu Jun 11 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"Easiest thing is to log it as flight sim, but NOT total time. You can log it as dual received, but it's inconsequential. Just be consistent, so if you need to change something it's easy to do. (don't change it in the logbook, but on whatever application you're filling out). The other thing you're going to want to do is log it FAA, not 95-1. So, when you get to an advanced aircraft with wheels, start logging when you ""leave the chocks"" as long as you intend to fly, or when you take off if there's no ground taxi. (you're officially flying at that point, so you should be anyway.)  log NVG as night AND nvg.  It counts. Once you graduate, log time on the controls as PIC, and when you make PC, you can further separate that as ""signed for the aircraft"" PIC. (part 1, vs 61). (you can log it as pic because per army regs, they're two pilot required aircraft...)   Oh... I didn't specifically log it as simulated instrument, but I suppose you could. I just said it was flight sim..  I'm using the giant jeppeson professional book."
Helicopters,39gbu0,BosoxH60,2,Thu Jun 11 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"Read up on FAR 61.51. In comparison to 95-1 you'll find some rather significant discrepancies with how time is logged. Most significantly is PC time. Also becomes relevant when you start dealing with wheeled helicopters. You're doing right by maintaining a separate book. Understand that what the Army tracks, it doesn't track for you, it tracks it for the Army/Commander. Expect accordingly from flight ops at your unit."
Helicopters,39gbu0,Cerebro64,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"You should log it as per the FAA / TC / aviation organization for your country.

Helicopters,39gbu0,Solieus,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:39 2015 UTC,"The FAA reg is easy enough to find, but all it says is ""Simulator time may be logged provided an instructor is present"", which isn't what I'm asking.  What I'm asking is what columns do I put the damn time into? It's such a simple question but Google has proved fruitless, which is why I came here, but from what I've seen the prevailing opinion is ""look up the regs"" (which I have) and/or ""keep another logbook"" (which I do)."
Helicopters,39gbu0,Solieus,2,Thu Jun 11 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"My logbook has a separate column for SIM, and in canada it does not count as day or night ""real"" time - it is just sim time. However it counts as instrument time if it is an IFR-style flight and a certain portion of sim instrument hours can be used towards your IFR ticket hours.   I know some super special fancy sims can count as ""real"" day/night time but I assume your sims are not of that calibre. I would make sure the sim you use is actually certified and has a registration number, otherwise it may not count at all."
Helicopters,39gbu0,Solieus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"They're full-motion sims, and the hours do count toward our instrument rating, which is part of the reason I'm asking at all.  I get it, logbooks are simple, but this seemed like the best place to ask. Because the Army does our books for us, most students don't bother keeping one and we never get any instruction on how to do them properly.

Helicopters,39gbu0,slccsoccer28,3,Thu Jun 11 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"Just because it is full motion does not mean it counts; you need to look up the registration of the simulator (it should be registered with the FAA) and it will tell you what class of sim it is and then that will tell you what kind of hours ""count"" WRT civil aviation hours."
Helicopters,39gbu0,lowflier,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"Why do you insist on arguing about whether the sim counts or not?

Helicopters,39gbu0,jediforhire,2,Thu Jun 11 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Just because the hours count towards your Army instrument rating, doesn't mean the hours count for the FAA.  The individual simulators have to be certified by the FAA and that costs money so the military doesn't do it.  The Navy has the same problem.  The Navy doesn't pay for the FAA to certify our full motion simulators.  So our simulator hours count towards our Navy Instrument rating, which can then be converted to an FAA instrument rating via equivalency test.  But the simulator hours themselves don't transfer/count."

Helicopters,39a82m,TheLyssis,6,Wed Jun 10 10:59:17 2015 UTC,Yep you can really stretch out the endurance because you are usually at lower power settings. I think the biggest thing to think about is the fact that you are usually low and slow. Be very conscious of being down wind vs into wind. All it takes are a couple of subtle turns and the wind is up your ass. Seems like Murphy's law always has the client asking to do downwind passes.  Have fun and congrats on getting going
Helicopters,39a82m,HeliHaole,6,Wed Jun 10 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"Remember the fucking wires.  Also, make an agreement with the other pilot to call out every wire on your flight path that either one of you see, no matter if you think the other guy has already seen them. A few extra spoken words won't hurt anyone. Assuming that the other person has seen the wires, even if they seem totally obvious to you, will get you both dead."
Helicopters,39a82m,achwas,4,Wed Jun 10 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"I've been doing pipeline patrol for awhile.  Best advice I can give you is ask questions if you're unsure of anything. Don't expect everything to make complete sense the first few months. You're new, you'll make mistakes, you won't see the line all of the time, much less know where it runs, or what encroachments are reportable and what aren't. But as long as you're a team player, and can show the company that you're learning and making progress, you'll be find.  You'll be down in the wire environment, so cockpit resource management is paramount. Don't be afraid to call out wires or other hazards to flight. Sometimes I see wires my partner doesn't, and vice versa.   If something doesn't feel right, or feels unsafe, don't be afraid to speak up. I've gotten that ill feeling in the back of my mind before, broken off the line, and climbed to get a better look at the environment. It's saved my life several times.  Since you'll be flying low and slow, a flight helmet might not be a bad idea.  As far as the flying being aggressive, yes, it can be. It's been the most aggressive flying I've done in my career. But give it some time. Some of it will feel uncomfortable at first, but within few months, it will begin to feel as second nature as walking down the street. But, if you begin to feel sick, speak up. We can make adjustments to the flight profile, or land. But it's a lot easier to fix this sooner, rather than later. Once you're in the bag, you're in the bag. Don't feel bad though, it happens to the best of us.  Best of luck, and congratulations on the job. It's a lot of fun. Give me a shout if you have any questions."

The pilot told me not eat to much they i may be sick, but everything went fine, however i agree following the pipe in between the trees damn was hard, and the most scary part was just fly at 10 meters from the wires and going actually really fast next to the ground.

Helicopters,39a82m,G--Man,5,Fri Jun 12 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"""This is not a job for someone right out of flight school."" As any other helicopter job I guess?  I dont know if this is a job for a someone who just gratuated but a friend of mine who actually have 20,000hours of flight mainly sling loading, who started sling loading at 175hours with the SA 315B Lama, was put on the helicopter, they said good luck to him, and then hoped to see him back in the evening.  And I know a lot of good pilots that actually started like this, in the ""laisser faire style"". But hey, lets face it, times are different now, no one would give you and helicopter with 175 hours and say ""go sling load around"" (for more then 1 reason, assurance, type ratings...). The only way to get hours now seems like following the instructor path (or the offshore copi), you say ""this is not a job for someone right out flightschool"" and you are probably right, but are we sure being an istructor with 250hours and teaching other people how to fly is much more safer? In my specific case I was flying with a pilot next to me with a camera taking picture, but he is a totally qualified pilot, and apparently you will never be alone cause one person on boards need to take pictures of the pipe.  Id totally like to hear from you what a young pilot of approx 170h should do to arrive to 250h (or more of course) apart from paying and taking his friends around."
Helicopters,39aeal,Keeeeeeeenan,9,Wed Jun 10 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"Where are you headed, what are you learning in?  Time in the helicopter is PRECIOUS! Every minute in it represents large portions of an hour worked IRL to be able to make it happen. Don't let the instructor waste YOUR $5/minute time teaching you remedial stuff that could have been learned on the ground.   Learn and memorize the emergency procedures and the limitations for your helicopter before you even get in the seat. On the same page, sit in the helicopter alone for an hour with the handbook out. Look at your limitations, and then try to mentally place where the corresponding gauge is BEFORE looking. Repeat this process until you have all the gauges locations memorized for all the limitations.  Familiarity with gauges will reduce stress when doing your scan and keep your eyes outside the cockpit more when you start.  Radio calls are important, but they come with time. You can dial into a live ATC station on your smartphone and listen while you do other things.  Make sure you have enough money to finish flightschool! Too many pilots start with just enough, and then fail because of unexpected costs or slower progress than expected. Do all of your training as fast as possible. Some instructors will say you will retain more if you space it out. Don't believe that at all.  Finally, make friends with everyone. This job is about who knows you, not who you know. It's a small community. As long as you are safe, a good personality will get you in more doors than the guy that has stellar stick and rudder skills. But that doesn't hurt either."

If you really do need to get it, then 3x the amount for fixed wing is probably not unreasonable.

This was many years ago and I believe the deductible was somewhat lower.  I highly doubt they lost any money on it and personally it was probably less that if I went out and got the insurance for myself.  Everywhere else I have been just factors this into the hourly rate."

Honest question from, admittedly, a still-in-flight-school-pleb: How common is it to fly (leisurely or professionally) in the danger areas of the ""Dead man's curve""?   Why do I constanly hear about safe flight speeds vs altitudes in training only to see SOOO many videos of pilots crossing those very boundaries?"
Helicopters,394af6,_WonderBeard_,7,Tue Jun 9 05:31:12 2015 UTC,"So many jobs require the machines to be in that area, that's why they were built at the end of the day.  Remember that the HV diagram will generally be in the 'performance' section of your POH and not the 'limitations' section. If I remember correctly, Bell (or whoever it was) use to have it under the limitations section, but then if someone has an accident when they were flying within the grey area, insurance can just say ""It's a limitation of the aircraft and you shouldn't be flying like that, pay up"".  Now that it's under 'performance', it's not saying 'this is what the machine is capable of and this is what it's not', but showing you what the safest way of flying is for that particular aircraft. You as a pilot just have to manage those risks."
Helicopters,394af6,crafty_miner,2,Tue Jun 9 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"Robinson says in their safety course that the heights/speeds in the HV Diagram are what it would take an ""average"" pilot to preform an autorotation without damaging the aircraft too badly. The factory pilots were able to do the maneuvers in a fraction of the distances/speeds but when they put FAA test pilots behind the controls, they started balling up aircraft. So, they padded them to ensure that an ""average"" pilot, would be able to not completely total an aircraft in that range.  So even being in the HV diagram, doesn't directly mean doom. Just need to be ready for game time."
Helicopters,394af6,achemze,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"This is what I have been gathering over time, that flying in the danger zone (pun definitely intended) happens and it's up to the pilot to mitigate that inevitable risk. Thanks for the reply."
Helicopters,394af6,_WonderBeard_,3,Tue Jun 9 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Hey WB good question. There are some situations where to get the task done it is needed to operate in the shaded area of the Avoid Curve - departing a confined area, hoisting, long-lining, powerline repair etc.  The rest of the time airmanship dictates that you should remain outside height/speed combinations that will make a safe touchdown after an engine failure problematic.    Even in the cases above an element of risk management is done first - is there another way to do this, where am I going to go if something goes wrong, one eye glued to the instruments, minimise the time in the curve.  The reason you hear so much about it in training is because its important to keeping you alive and to operating professionally. I can't speak to the fact that there are many videos showing otherwise."
Helicopters,394af6,_WonderBeard_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"I wonder about complacency. When you go so many hours without incident is there a settling into the assumption that ""nothing"" is gonna happen? I would love to be able to see/hear the example of a pilot who does in fact fly in those danger areas but does so hesitantly, with caution (what checks/precautions do they make, when, why, etc) and contrast that example with the cowboys who either no longer give a shit or have fallen complacent."
Helicopters,394af6,achemze,2,Tue Jun 9 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"I have seen this mentality in high time pilots. I've literally had pilots say ""The factory says there's only a handful a year reported, virtually all from abuse or misuse, i'm not worried about an engine failure at 150' AGL""."
Helicopters,394af6,JeffreyDudeLebowski,2,Wed Jun 10 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"This is key.  One thing I learned from an old crusty instructor years ago at flight school: ""Aggressive precision flying, while dangerous, can be mitigated to be more safe through attention to detail and smooth control than carelessly day dreaming while straight and level"".  This is a little different for me, because I am never solo, but anytime we do dust landings under goggles, or are power limited with external loads on hot days, or hovering OGE with a hoist or rapellers, the non flying pilot always calls out power settings, AGL altitudes, and/or whatever else will assist the pilot on the controls to focus outside while also being able to know how the bird is preforming without needing to glance in at the instrument panel.  The army can have its way of sucking the fun out of things and because of that we operate slightly different from civilian organizations.  Having flown small single engine airplanes around with my friends and family it always amazed me at how different it was planning flights, and gearing up to go.  Before every military flight a risk assessment matrix is filled out with values given to weather and environmental conditions, the experience and duty day/rest cycle of the crew, where you are flying, for how long, what the mission entails, etc.  If the risk outweighs the necessity of the mission you do not launch.  I know there are plenty of pilots that do this mentally on the civilian side as well and make good decisions, but sometimes there is an added benefit to seeing it all written down on paper.  Like you and a few others have mentioned, flying in those danger areas can be done when it is necessary.  But, why put yourself, and a family no less, at the extra risk when you can still fly the machine safely, still have a good view and give the average non-flying citizen a good time in the sky without the added danger."
Helicopters,394af6,_WonderBeard_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"Great reply, thank you! Very insightful.   I'd love a chance to see these matrices you speak of... Is it software based? Any known civilian equivalent that you know of?"

Helicopters,394af6,Cropgun,2,Tue Jun 9 19:54:32 2015 UTC,It can be done safely.  Being the curve just eliminates a lot of safety cushion.  You really need to have a plan ready all the time while in the curve.  You're basically always set up for a failure of some sort.  Every little mistake you make will be amplified so you need to be on your game.
Helicopters,394af6,xeon1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:01:10 2015 UTC,there are two sections of the HV. one is slow and low (which is the bulk of it) and the other is fast and really low. he is over 50kts so with decent reaction times he has enough forward energy to trade during his auto. he is closer to the other part of the HV which is being so fast and so low you don't have the reaction time to do your flare/auto. to be in that u need to be lower than ~25' agl for ~50kts+. he is low but i'd say he is still above 25'. so at eod he is not really in the HV 'danger areas.' that being said.. flying close to terrain is always dangerous if you are not EXTREMELY familar with the area. on top of that he is in an a-star which can experience servo-transparency or jack stall at increased stick loads... something you don't want to experience close to the ground!

Helicopters,38rico,vincopotamus,4,Sat Jun 6 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Some good descriptions of each type of crew here here.  Most wildland firefighters start out either on an engine, which is basically a large truck with a pump and water to fight fires, or a handcrew which uses hand tools to dig fireline around a fire.  Helitack crews specialize in wildfire operations using a helicopter, which typically includes utilizing an external bucket for water drops, slinging external cargo in and out of fires, shuttling crews in hard-to-access fires, and providing recon of new fire starts.  Hotshot crews are highly specialized 20-person crews that go to the hottest, most dangerous parts of the fires to build handline to stop fires.  They are basically the grunts of the firefighting world.    Wildland firefighting in general is a hard and dirty job that involves hiking long distances over rugged terrain with heavy packs in hot, smoky environments.  If you'd like to get into helicopters via the firefighting route, you should know that you'll have to deal with that reality on a day-in, day-out basis during the fire season.  The pay can be lucrative, but it is hard work and most firefighters only work 5-6 months out of the year."

Examples like, ""At this altitude, how far away from the clouds are you allowed to fly?"" and ""You're flying my helicopter loaded with people and the tail rotor chip light comes on, where/when are you landing?"" ""What will you do if you go inadvertent imc?""   With the mom and pop robinson tour companies it really shouldn't be too difficult. Just show up presentable, maybe wear a suit and shave, be prepared with your current flight times.  If you have low hours (assuming you do) be prepared for the ""why should I hire you when the guy before your interview had a 1000 more hours than you?""

Helicopters,37vas8,ccoopersc,3,Sat May 30 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"Here is how it works:  1) You pay for your private flight training with them and fly with one of their instructors.  2) You get your private license, then start building your hours for your commercial license.  3) While ""flight training"" for your commercial license, you are at the controls, while your CFI is hanging out the side with a camera, taking pictures of boats. You pay for the flight time.  4) During this flight time, you can legally log PIC because you are licensed (PPL) and at the controls. The CFI also logs PIC as well because he is a licensed instructor (FAA rules). This is still a grey area because the CFI can technically only log the time he is providing instruction, and it is at best questionably if ""taking photos of boats"" can count as instruction.   5) The company sells the pictures and makes additional money.  Once you get your Commercial License and CFI, you become the ""instructor"", hanging out the side taking photos while logging the flight time, while your PPL rated ""Student"" pays for the time and flies.  My questions for you to think about:  1) How good is your instructor going to be, if most of his flight time after his own PPL was spent flying some guy with a camera around, or taking photos? Keep in mind that your instructor will most likely only have between 300-800 hours himself when you start training there, and he will have done just that during these 300-800 hours.  2) During your commercial training, what kind of quality of instruction are you most likely receiving when your ""instructor"" is actually taking photos of boats?  3) What kind of hours are you building once you are the ""CFI"", if you aren't actually flying or instructing because you are busy holding a camera?  4) If you were the chief pilot of a company, and you wanted to hire say a 1,000hr pilot, would you hire someone whose 1,000 hours consisted mostly of holding a camera instead of a cyclic?  Anyhow, that's my 2 cents."

This boat pics operation sounds like a sketchy time builder and nothing more to me! A photo flight is not something to be taken lightly and a very redundant flight will not be condusive to training!

Helicopters,37fx03,CriticallyAcclaimed,1 point,Wed May 27 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Don't give your hopes up too quick, the HR 476 Bill is still being ironed out. The VA is capping flight tuition to $20k a year, which won't even cover a semester of flight. While granted, that's separate from basic tuition for the obligatory degree program, you're going to need to cough up the remainder of the cost. And with limitations being set on incoming students, that will limit hiring of CFIs. I'm currently enrolled and ""grandfathered in"", but I too am at risk of not finding a job, and hours ARE everything in this business, and CFI is a great position to build them, and in some instances is a prerequisite to a job. Research thoroughly, and have a game plan before you make a decision."

This one here details how the bill hasn't even made it out of committee, nor has it been amended even once. As I'm sure you know, bills change, and this one has a long way to go before it even becomes a threat to people like us. The reason you are ""at risk"" of not finding a job has nothing to do with this bill. Fresh helicopter pilots almost never get a flying job right out of school, thats just how it is."

Last thing you need is your flight training money tied up in small claims court if the place folds up.  I was an instructor for nearly 4 years and I had plenty of students come from other schools in my time. (Silverstate went under when I was teaching and my school got A LOT of their students). As long as you're not part 141 changing schools shouldn't be that much of an issue. It will probably take you two or three more hours than it would have at your old school.  Your new instructor will want to feel you out see where you're at in your training, and make you go though all the PTS maneuvers at least once so he can endorse you for the practical checkride.   Also keep in mind that different instructors have different 'things' they care about. One may be all about approach angles, another might be about RPM management during autorotations. Don't let yourself get stuck relearning how to do a maneuver the way your new instructor likes it, as long as you can fly to PTS standards and are safe, it's time to move on.   In the end this could be a good thing, the more people you fly with the more you can learn how different people do things."
Helicopters,378hji,blackoutjr,5,Mon May 25 20:18:31 2015 UTC,Im contacting them now about getting my remaining balance back. It's about $600 I think. I figured I'll just call up some local schools and tell then my situation and see what they say about signing up through them. Thanks for the reply.

Still, that seems like a high rate of issue, so this may be a blessing in disguise.   Are you trying to train to just get the PPL or are you trying to turn this into a career?"

Helicopters,378hji,HeadnCloud9,3,Mon May 25 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"Then, as someone who completed his CFI/II a few months ago and who has interviewed at 4 or 5 different places around the country, I highly recommend that you take this time to find a school with 44's to get some 44 time. I was turned down from two schools because I didn't have my SFAR endorsement (for instruction) in the 44. Most training schools have 22's, but there are a lot of multi-operation companies that use 44's because they can do, well, everything: instruction, tours, long-line training, ag work, and charters. All you need are 25 hours in that ship, and so long as you get the SFAR to instruct in the 22, you can apply those 25 hours to get the SFAR to instruct in the 44. Even if you never instruct in the 44, you are PIC capable, so you can fly it for your next, non-instructor job. (I'm assuming you understand that the SFAR 73 has experience requirements for instructors)."

Helicopters,378hji,Wissam24,1 point,Tue May 26 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"That does suck. But depending on what area you are located in, there could be better schools for you out there. Out of curiosity, do you know anything about how the mast bumping situation occurred? Was it a new solo student? An overconfident instructor?   Edited to answer your question: yes, I had to switch schools. It was a pain but I found that the schools really were welcoming. It was mostly a pain due to what someone else mentioned here which is that each instructor has their way of wanting you to do things. This may be more applicable in the early stages. For example, my previous instructor stressed a two step pick-up (1)get light on the skids, note the correction needed to be made to stay straight and level 2)lower collective, input correction, start again). But when I did that in my new school (lowered collective as part of the pick-up) he was like what are you doing??? We're taking off, why are you putting in down collective??"
Helicopters,378hji,KillerRaccoon,1 point,Tue May 26 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't talked to my instructor much about the accident itself. I'll find out all the details when I go in to get the remaining balance on my account. I'm assuming it was a solo student flight because he mentioned that the pilot shouldn't be alive. About new schools, yea thats what I was worried about. I don't mind doing a check flight with a new instructor to see where I'm at. It's really about the money that bothers me. I saved up enough to get this done. It was gonna cut it close already, now it's gonna be even closer to draining the account. Just gonna have to pay for some more time. At least it's hours logged."

Helicopters,379vrp,autowikibot,3,Tue May 26 06:24:56 2015 UTC,"Jet fuel:       Jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. It is colourless to straw-colored in appearance. The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1, which are produced to a standardized international specification. The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is Jet B, which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance.  Jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons. The range of their sizes (molecular weights or carbon numbers) is restricted by the requirements for the product, for example, the freezing point or smoke point. Kerosene-type jet fuel (including Jet A and Jet A-1) has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 (carbon atoms per molecule); wide-cut or naphtha-type jet fuel (including Jet B), between about 5 and 15.

Helicopters,36vyau,DrCMoneybags,9,Fri May 22 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame that politics took over all the scout programs. Having something that can carry 4 pax, still fly fast and carry decent armament (50s, 2.75 rockets, HF, etc) is what a scout should be. Instead of just giving the roll to crapches that don't suit the current scout mindset. I know most of our now ex-pilots would and did give the ground guys everything, including all the M4 ammo they have after everything else is spent. It's pretty insane when a bird comes back to rearm and they ask you to bring out some M4 mags out too."
Helicopters,36vyau,Wrath169,7,Fri May 22 18:32:24 2015 UTC,"I've said this ever since they decided to divest in the -58. The Apache will never be able to provide the ground force commander with anything remotely close to the support they received from the Kiowa. The bureaucrats swear that the ASR mission is less about the airframe and more about the aviators. To that I say BULLSHIT. It's the combination of the two: A well trained aviator in a purpose-built scout airframe.  A pilot looking through a FLIR system will never equal the situational awareness that a pilot leaning out a door can. The Apache will never be a formidable ASR platform and the Army will end up buying a COTS replacement or pull the Kiowa out of storage. Personally, I think the MD530F that we bought the Afghans would be an amazing replacement."
Helicopters,36vyau,KTBFFHCFC,2,Fri May 22 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"It's not meant to be a full on replacement, it's an 80% solution(paired with drones), there simply isn't the funding right now for a 100% or even better a 110% solution. That's simply what happens when you get your budget cut, you lose capability."
Helicopters,36vyau,Eskali,2,Sat May 23 08:48:47 2015 UTC,"I understand that the ""replacement"" is the -64 coupled with Grey Eagle. The reason I didn't mention the use of UAS is because it's more of an observation platform than it is an ASR or even a standalone scout platform. Manned-unmanned teaming CAN be effective if the eyes you have close to the target can effectively locate and identify that target, but the Apache's reliance on systems to accomplish this rather than the actual aviator and his particular set of skills is a hindrance.  Edit: Don't get me started on the budget cut. It had less to do with actual funding and more to do with the fact that bureaucrats and retired Generals (I'm looking at you General Cody) have wanted the -58 gone for a long time. At the end of the day, the Apache as an ASR platform will be more expensive by a long shot than it would have been to keep and update the -58 to an -F model or continue the CASUP program."

S-97 was in fact designed for the ARH program, but when it got scrapped they kept developing. It is now the baseline design concept for the JMR competition, which challenges competitors to design a series of helicopters to cover multiple roles (scout, attack, light utility, medium utility, heavy lift) with a common design and as many common parts as possible. The tech developed for X2 and S-97 will be used as the concept for Sikorsky-Boeings designed of the SB-1 Defiant which will come in three sizes: wee, a little less wee, and friggen huge. All jokes aside, they plan to use the SB-1 design for a scout, attack/light utility, and medium utility, with the CH-53K designed used for heavy lift. I'll cite my sources when I have a minute."

Helicopters,36c3h7,annerajb,1 point,Mon May 18 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"No.  Depending where it happened/what they were doing, it is usually not classified, but is sensitive, so the full report is not released to the public."
Helicopters,36c3h7,M230,1 point,Mon May 18 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"It's really the weight that plays such a factor in the autos. The aw609 is reported to have ""benign"" autos. This is probably due to its disk area vs max gross. I spent some time around the osprey when they were first coming in and being tested ( the second time after the investigation) they are really quite heavy. I guess the only reason I bring this up is because I've been hearing a lot of crap about how all tilt rotors can't auto at my work. This simply isn't the case."
Helicopters,36c3h7,P38sheep,1 point,Mon May 18 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"I found a video of the crash from a reverse angle. It looks like it came down at a high decent rate, but you really can't tell the forward airspeed from this angle. Could very well be a settling with power scenario but it's hard to say.  https://youtu.be/xRuM1DsGDtY  In a situation like this I don't think too many helicopter can ""auto"" to correct the situation. You'd have to have a lot of power available or forward airspeed to recover. Otherwise even a Huey with their high inertia blades still would have come down hard."

Helicopters,35w09g,prometheus5500,14,Wed May 13 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"The rotorcraft route is expensive and risky.  There's a much better chance that you'll never find that first job and the whole thing was a waste of time and money.  It also, typically, takes much bigger sacrifices to get from where you are now to a point in the industry where finding work isn't difficult.  I'm not saying don't do it, but educate yourself, and know what you're getting in to.  There's far more security in the fixed-wing route."

And yeah, being that fixed-wings do all the heavy lifting for humanity (long-haul cargo, passengers, ect), it makes sense that there's more security in it."
Helicopters,35w09g,R0T0R,4,Thu May 14 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of competition for very few jobs (and a very real chance you don't ever get a job), relocating often, bad hours and the expectation that your job is your life, terrible pay (some people can't survive on it), very little job security... and so on."
Helicopters,35w09g,BrolecopterPilot,1 point,Thu May 14 00:06:17 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound too different from the options I have in fixed-wing (being that I want to stay out of the airlines anyway).    How much does skill get recognized? What I mean is, are hours the only thing that will get me a job, or does being a good pilot get me a job? Obviously it will be some combination, but basically, I was hovering at 1 hour (I've got 1.2 rotor time logged) and am thinking I may have an easier time, say, landing a job at my flight school, if I've impressed the instructors there. Basically, any idea how far letters of recommendations go?"
Helicopters,35w09g,achwas,5,Thu May 14 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"How much does skill get recognized?   Whether you hover at hour one or hour ten, it doesn't matter. Employers want to see dedication, persistence, hard work, personal skills, good decision making, integrity etc., etc. All of that is what makes a good pilot and that's something you should know by now.   Being a natural on the stick can make some aspects of training a bit quicker, but that is only one small part of a multi-faceted skill set."
Helicopters,35w09g,SeaManaenamah,1 point,Thu May 14 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"small part of a multi-faceted skill set.   Indeed, and I do know this. My mentioning my hovering was just an example. Basically, I was asking how far recommendations go in this industry. Everyone I've flown with likes the way I fly (obviously that isn't just based on how smooth my landings are) and am wondering how much this gets recognition, as opposed to the base-line hours.    Ok... to sound like a total ego-driven dick... If I'm better than everyone else, will that get me jobs or are hours just THAT predominant in job applications? In the fixed wing world, it really feels like hours are the only thing an employer even notices (of course, this is coming from my student perspective, a naturally limited angle)."
Helicopters,35w09g,Torkin,8,Thu May 14 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"With few outliers, everyone can hover and fly a helicopter reasonably well after finishing their training. Anyone who has been paying attention to their instructor knows how to fly well enough to also pass a ride with a chief pilot for any entry level job. It's not black magic, at all. All an employer wants to see during an interview check flight is:  1) is the person safe? Do they rush things, take off too fast, fly harsh? Or are they confident and consistent, take their time and fly smoothly like they were taught in flight school? Basically: ""do I have to worry that they'll crash my machine?""  2) Do they have an attitude that is appropriate for their level of experience? Or is this a 100hr guy who thinks he is Chuck Aaron? Do they already have bad habits? Basically: ""Do I have to worry that they'll crash my machine?""  3) Are they familiar with the rules and regulations as well as the operation of the machine in question? Do they know the emergency procedures? Basically: ""Do I have to worry that they'll crash my machine?""  All of this is very basic stuff and almost everyone can learn it unless they happen to be idiots. So no, you will not be able to distinguish yourself through superior stick and rudder skill. The jobs that do require specialized skills such as precision long lining, high altitude flying, power line work etc are completely inaccessible for low timers for liability and insurance reasons as well as client standards.  What does get noticed is attitude, persistence, and work ethic when you are in school. That potential employer is likely to call your former instructor or chief instructor and ask if it's worth giving you a shot. If they say he's a nice guy but tends to show up late and never helped wash the machine, your SOL."
Helicopters,35w09g,R0T0R,2,Thu May 14 04:37:09 2015 UTC,That all makes a good deal of sense. Thanks for the write up. I appreciate it.    Maaann.... I really am thinking I may switch. Helicopter jobs just seem so much more interesting to me...
Helicopters,35w09g,Paranoma,4,Thu May 14 04:52:36 2015 UTC,"Like the previous person that replied just said, your skill at operating the controls is just one area that employers look at. There are lots of other things that are taken into consideration beyond that, and one of the easiest things for them to see is going to be your flight time."
Helicopters,35w09g,J_Tomonaga,2,Thu May 14 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"Aviation is a small industry and the rotorcraft side is even smaller. That means that after a while you will have a reputation, good or bad, when you seek new jobs. Your interpersonal skills and aeronautical decision making play a much bigger role than your skill on the stick. Really, only very bad pilots get noticed for their skill. You have to remember that in many jobs you are the only pilot in the aircraft, so other than the occasional check ride or initial training no one sees how good or bad you are."
Helicopters,35w09g,zVo,3,Thu May 14 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"The same problems exist for low-time airplane pilots, but not nearly to the extent that they do for helicopter pilots. Go to any pilot job website and look at the difference in available jobs for low-time pilots.  For a brand new helicopter pilot, there's far fewer jobs, they're almost all flight instructor positions, and the competition will be much greater.  There's far more to being a desirable pilot than stick skills. The fact that you picked up the hover quicker than average says absolutely nothing about what kind of pilot you'll be at 200, 500, or 1000 hours. This is coming from someone who had the hover figured out by the end of their discovery flight; it's completely insignificant. Employers need a pilot with knowledge, good judgement, and good decision making. The lack of those things is what bends airframes and kills people.  I can't say it enough:  How quickly you picked up a hover and how many hours it takes to get your ratings really does not matter.  People care about how good of a pilot and/or flight instructor you are, not how quick of a student you were.  Similar to how, if you're going in for invasive surgery, you're far more concerned about how experienced and knowledgeable your surgeon is that day, than how good he was at fingerpainting in kindergarten."
Helicopters,35w09g,throwitawayricochet,2,Thu May 14 07:18:56 2015 UTC,"Another thing I haven't seeing mentioned is attitude. You may be able to fly great, but if you don't have the right attitude you will be tossed to the side. Every employer I've talked to has said that they would much rather higher w decent pilot with a great attitude than a great pilot with a shit attitude. Cocky, anti-authoritative, know it all, rude... All these count."
Helicopters,35w09g,zVo,5,Wed May 20 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"Networking, TIMING, and personality.  Beyond that hrs = insurable.  If you are low time you'll never be considered for things like EMS or large companies like PHI (your application/resume’ will never get past HR).  If you want to go AG you should be prepared to refuel and reload hoppers for some time.  If you show commitment and good work ethics and if your boss likes you he may throw you in the seat for ferry flights and things like that to build time until you are insurable.  Other than that, the typical route of everything else aviation…. get yer ratings then get a job as a CFI then build the hours.  After this see my first statement again.    Now, this is my opinion as someone who has done a lot of hrs both fixed and rotary wing flying.  Helicopters are hard to learn, but easy to master.  Airplanes are easy to learn, but hard to master.  I loved every bit of flying I did in a helicopter but the life style outside of the cockpit was a pain the ass.  Fixed wing flying while not always as exciting does afford me a much more comfortable lifestyle, more consistency, and more stability.  If you really just want to fly low in helicopters then find a career that makes you rich and buy a helicopter to fly around in your free time.  I know you love flying the machine right now, but trust me from expierence, flying anything every day for several thousnd hours can get old and it may just end up being job...."

I'm considering a switch to fixed wing because that industry's doing very well... or maybe even pursuing different career fields.   I would stick with fixed wing. Get your instructing ratings... get something solid to go with. You can do heli training after you have your fixed ratings; it's much cheaper, and you'll probably progress faster with all that coordination. When you get CFI and/or II, throw resumes out there like mad and hope one sticks. I'd stick with fixed wing for now, though, because it's so much easier to get a job! It's actually difficult to filter out the CFI fixed wing jobs to just see the heli CFI jobs.  Edit: I should add that I started out like you, with fixed wing first. Loved the stuff, but felt a bit empty after private. Did all heli ratings and loved it. I just flew a fixed wing again recently, and I loved that, too! It was my mindset that made me switch, but I truthfully love small aircraft of all sorts. They're a blast!"

I love the flying minus some of the b.s. that comes with the job, but I am in the process of finishing all my fixed-wing ratings. I'd argue there's not a lot of job security in the aviation world, but at least with airplanes, jobs abound. In the helicopter world, it's an entirely different picture. A couple of my buddies from the flight school I went to when I got my helo private have been unemployed many times due to instability of their employers and are now in the business world.  Lesson learned: go fixed-wing."

They mostly do things here in the U.S. like responding to disasters or training to defend the home land.

My problem is that I'm not down with killing people or helping people kill people. I am a strong opponent of war, and being a military pilot doesn't work well with those attitudes. I would much rather never fly again than use my love for aviation in an act of destruction. My conscious is more important to me than my log book and bank account.

Helicopters,35ri86,Cropgun,4,Wed May 13 01:14:24 2015 UTC,"Its pretty easy.  You tell them you are coming to spend money at their establishment, and ask them where they want you to park so you can enter the building and swipe the credit card.    A lot of times you're on recurring contracts and the hotel is used to having a helicopter and maybe even a whole crew with equipment because you stay in the same places.  You don't need to discuss anything with the feds."
Helicopters,35ri86,prometheus5500,5,Wed May 13 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"Maaaan, helicopters are cool. Now if only I was made of money...."
Helicopters,35ri86,Cropgun,4,Wed May 13 01:00:05 2015 UTC,You don't need to be made out of money.  You need to be made out of skill.  So you can get paid to fly one.

Helicopters,35ri86,PriceChild,1 point,Thu May 14 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly true. I met a guy who is flying for EMS who only had 250 hours of IMC time in a fixed wing. Since very few people who applied for the position had the minimum IMC time, let alone in a helicopter, he won out by simply hitting the minimums (2500/1000/250) [Total/PIC/IMC]. Obviously, your mileage may vary."

Add all the 160th's normal cool guy stuff for another couple mil, and then custom work to make it radar absorbing/deflecting/whatever they did, I would say it would easily break the $50mil mark"
Helicopters,35rumv,rumblebee2010,1 point,Wed May 13 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"There's also the consideration of whether you count R&D. If those costs are included, it's probably much higher per unit. This is probably about right if it's just for the delivery itself."
Helicopters,35rumv,Kimano,1 point,Wed May 13 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"Based on how the black gov't programs work I would be surprised if it were less than 100mil per unit, just because its sneaky bastard level operations."

Helicopters,35rumv,USCAV19D,1 point,Thu May 28 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well but I think it still might have been 160th considering who the customer was. FCD wouldnt be able to do a high profile mission like that since we needed to be able to announce that we got him after it was done. That wouldnt work for them I dont think... Also, a friend of mine tells me his old battalion commander, a former 160th guy, was on the mission."
Helicopters,35rumv,rumblebee2010,1 point,Fri May 29 21:39:42 2015 UTC,Well it's not like FCD's ops are so black that nobody knows about them. Either way they clearly did a damn good job!

Helicopters,35qvtf,IG-88A,6,Wed May 13 22:43:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.  Hugh Mills' account of piloting scouts in Vietnam was one of the best I've read so far.
Helicopters,35qvtf,rumblebee2010,7,Thu May 14 11:01:26 2015 UTC,Another great book about some incredible Vietnam helicopter pilots is To The Limit: An Air Cav Huey Pilot in Vietnam by Tom Johnson. Some of the stuff they talk about is absolutely outrageous to think of doing these days. Flying in formation and you need to ascend through a cloud layer? Just tighten the formation up... that should be fine...
Helicopters,35qvtf,IG-88A,3,Fri May 15 17:19:22 2015 UTC,I second that as well.

Helicopters,35gcjf,ClayJay751,13,Sun May 10 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"Neither, that's a silly comparison.  If you can fly a helicopter you can fly a helicopter, don't overthink it.  The skill comes in the decision making and judgement that comes with knowledge and experience.  Ten hours is nothing.  At ten hours, you won't be able to feel a difference between a R22, an S300, and a hammer."
Helicopters,35gcjf,R0T0R,6,Sun May 10 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a silly question at all. 22/44/206 have similar rotor systems, whereas the 300 does not. Feel is certainly different.  I agree however, that you won't get much of a feel for either with 10 hrs!"
Helicopters,35gcjf,HeliBif,3,Sun May 10 04:38:16 2015 UTC,"The Robinsons use low-inertia blades. Also, the 206 is turbine. Just because they have a semi-rigid rotor system doesn't make them similar."
Helicopters,35gcjf,wolfshot,2,Sun May 10 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"More so than the 300, which was OP's question in the first place."
Helicopters,35gcjf,HeliBif,6,Sun May 10 13:52:19 2015 UTC,"I wish I had a source but I'm on mobile.   Pretty sure the army is switching to the Lakota for flight school and they are for sure phasing out the 206 equivalent the Kiowa. There's a fancy name for the transition but the Army wants all twin engine rotary wing aircraft. I'm not sure on the effective date for the switch to Lakotas for flight school but there will soon be no more combat rated Kiowas, they are being sent to DRM. They also stopped training Kiowa pilots last year.   Hope this helps."

Helicopters,35gcjf,c5load,4,Sun May 10 11:22:44 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up about ""planning on commissioning Army Aviation."" Aviation is one of the most sought after branches in the Army on top of being one of the most expensive. I'm not sure what your commissioning source is (ROTC, OCS, or USMA), but think long and hard before you sign up about whether you are willing to serve as an officer in some other branch besides Aviation. There are no guarantees in the Army, especially when it comes to choice of branch and choice of post. They just might not have any Aviation slots for your commissioning class, or very very few. That is the unfortunate nature of the draw down.  I'm not trying to discourage you at all, I just want you to be able to make an informed decision. And as far as your actual question, I think I agree with a lot of the other commenters, at ten hours you still won't even have a feel for flying a helicopter, let alone the nuances of the different types. I think you're probably better off training in which ever is easier on your wallet."
Helicopters,35gcjf,rumblebee2010,4,Sun May 10 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"Good deal, you should be all set.  Here's a few tips from someone who went the same route you're going: 1) don't do anything stupid in the next three years that will give you a down slip. There is an LT in my unit who got passed up for CPT because he broke his foot sledding his firstie year and didn't get a platoon in time.  2) buy this book (http://thehangar.com/th-67-chapters-5-8-9.html) and memorize it verbatim. Not like kinda verbatim, literally word for word, syllable for syllable. Some people get bent out of shape over ""as required"" vs ""if required.""  3) download and read the FAA's rotorcraft hand book. It's free, and it will make ground school easier.  4) If you want to be a general some day, go to Ranger School between flight school and your first unit. If you want to have a miserable time re-learning how to fly at your new unit because it's been almost a year since you've touched the controls, go to Ranger School between flight school and your first unit. The only people in Aviation that give a shit about ranger tabs are lieutenants and full birds. Everyone else just cares how well you fly and how hard you work.  5) Don't rent your house from Becky Hancock Realty, they prey on pointers who don't know how to be real humans yet.  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. I made it through an RC-E deployment, made PC, and got promoted to CPT so I'd like to think I have somewhat of an idea about what you're about to go through.  Go Cowboys, Fired Up C4  *EDIT: complete #3 before #2, it will make 2 much easier to understand"
Helicopters,35gcjf,rumblebee2010,3,Mon May 11 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add to this about flight school. HAVE FUCKING FUN. So many people talk about how much of a downer it was. I had one of the best times there. Made some quality friends, bought a ton of shit I didn't need, and partied hard. When it's time to work, put your head down and work. But remember to relax.

Helicopters,35gcjf,HeliBif,3,Mon May 11 13:43:24 2015 UTC,"Any Bell 47's in your area? I've never flown one but always thought that the rotor system look very similar to the 206. I don't think it matters for your circumstances though. Basically, the 300's are safer and better suited for flight training but because the R-22 is so much cheaper, almost everyone uses them and will swear by them. I would imagine that the S300 tail rotor authority is probably closer to a 206 than the R-22 though."
Helicopters,35gcjf,SierraHotel058,1 point,Mon May 11 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"Assuming s300 = Schweizer 300 / Hu30, then the 22 is a better analogue to the 206. A 44 is even better. The three bladed rotor system of the 300 is much more responsive and a better analogue to the AS350. I imagine the 22 gives a much better sense of the control lag associated with 2 bladed rotor systems.   I trained exclusively on the 300. One hundred hrs, and my first flight on a 206 (less than a year later) I almost crashed the damn thing in the hover about a dozen times. Pretty much blew the check ride, but at least it became a quasi training flight and I learned how the 206 would respond for the next time I got behind the controls.  My first flight in an AS350, many years later, I felt right at home again (besides the opposite spinning rotors, and right skid low hover!). Despite so many hours in the 206 I had no issues on the Astar since I guess that control sensitivity was ingrained in my muscle memory. Many pilots who have flown 2-bladed systems exclusively, find the Astar quite fidgety to hover."
Helicopters,35gcjf,Johnnynukemall,1 point,Sun May 10 05:29:20 2015 UTC,I plan on commissioning into Army Aviation next year and wanted to pick up 5-10 hours before I went to just see if it's something I really want to do.   It really does not matter which helicopter you get your initial experience in. Whatever you learn will be easily carried with you from model to model.
Helicopters,35eq9y,TheTexanPilot,3,Sat May 9 17:06:11 2015 UTC,Great course as long as you don't up with a bunch of tools in there with you. I had a great experience and met some fantastic pilots.

Helicopters,35cn5g,mrhelio,3,Sat May 16 00:47:49 2015 UTC,What these guys said....Why do you think you need turbine transition training? How many hours do you have total? There is a common misconception that paying for a dozen hours in a turbine helicopter will help you get that first turbine job. I know because I was under that same impression a few years back.  I can almost guarantee that you would be better off spending your money in other ways in order to advance your career.
Helicopters,35cn5g,mrhelio,9,Sat May 9 07:28:54 2015 UTC,"If you can afford it the best option by far is to go to the manufacture's safety course, so in your case Eurocopter(airbus helicopters) EC120 factory safety course.   This is really the only type of transition that counts for anything.  For example you will get a break from your insurance company. Plus you are learning from the people who designed and build that helicopter.  You'll get a bunch of awesome Eurocopter swag and training manuals  that will make all your flying buddies back home jealous.    Another option would be to take a mountain flying coarse.  If you can't find someone to do the course in the EC120 try to do it in a AS350B3  or An EC130 since both those helicopters are very similar to the 120.     I'm working in Socal right now. If you're looking for school recommendations in the area I'm happy to point you in the right direction."
Helicopters,35cn5g,mrhelio,4,Sat May 9 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that advice, I had not considered going to Eurocopter!  Would love to hear your school recommendations in the SoCal area, I am down there regularly."
Helicopters,35cn5g,rotorRat,8,Sat May 9 21:11:38 2015 UTC,"I checked around and Helistream would be my first suggestion if you're going this route http://helistream.com/ They have allot of training experience In everything from r22's up to 205s and have an EC120!    Its a shame you have your mind set on the EC120.  Its a pretty rare helicopter these days.  Now if you moved up to the AS350 aka ""Astar"" there are tons of them around, and therefore allot more people who teach in them. So I could give you many more suggestions on where to go for training.  The down side to the Astar is its very sensitive, its nickname is the squirrel  and you'll see why as soon as you fly it. If you like the EC120 you'll like the EC130 even more. Its basically what you'd get if the Astar and the EC120 had kids together.  The EC130T2 has a nice huge cabin and The best climate control system you're going to find. Its the helicopter all your friends will want to fly around in - it was specifically designed for passenger comfort and visibility. It was also designed for inexperienced pilots to fly, so for example the engine start is as simple as turning on the fuel pump and flipping the engine ""on"" switch.      The bell 206 series would honestly be my first suggestion for type of turbine helicopter to train in.  They are very simple, steady, relatively cheap and prevalent. There is a reason the army does all their initial helicopter training in their version of the 206.  Also later on it would be very easy to move up into a 407. The 407 is an awesome helicopter especially with all the upgrades like a glass cockpit and leather seats!       What i'm getting at is to think about what helicopter you're going to end up in down the line, and learn to fly in one of its relatives.  Eurocopter or Bell? Those are the main routes. Message me when you make up your mind and I will be happy to give more advice that I wouldn't post publicly.  I would also suggest going to the HAI convention next spring, so you can check out all the types of helicopters in one place.     TLDR:   Decide what helicopter Series suits you. Do the factory training course."
Helicopters,35cn5g,charlie-morton,2,Wed May 13 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed post!  My mind is not set on the EC120 necessarily, but my situation forces me in that direction.  I would be fine with an older Bell, personally, but my top priority is keeping my noise profile down, which forces me in the EC direction.  EC130 vs EC120 is a harder decision - TBH, even the EC120 is more helicopter than I need, so the higher purchase cost, operating cost, and size of an EC130 is hard to balance against the FADEC and increased passenger capacity.  I will get some time in both, and definitely go to HAI!  I will message you if I get closer to making a decision."

Helicopters,35cv8m,BaconContest,7,Sat May 9 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"This story isn't exactly relevant, but along the same lines:  First off, let me preface this story with some background. Army helicopter pilots leaving flight school are just barely competent pilots. A majority of the mastering of the art and science of flying rotary wing aircraft is done at the new pilots first unit. Especially advanced maneuvers like degraded visibility (whiteout/brownout) landings and landing to confined areas.  Shortly after arriving to my unit I deployed to a training area in the Mojave desert where the Army does large exercises. I had just been signed off RL1, which is an Army unit's way of saying a pilot has met the basic requirements to fly missions.   Upon arriving at the training area, I was given a two landing demonstration of a brownout landing in the dusty California desert, and then told to perform a dust landing of my own to show that I undestood the instruction. I was the 10th pilot to be put through the training that day, so the IP was ready to finish up for the day, and most of the dust in the LZ we were being trained at had been blown away. Needless to say, my first dust landing wasn't particularly dusty, and as a new pilot I honestly was just more worried about doing the basics right and didn't really notice the dust. Dust qual: dust qual complete.  Fast forward two days. The training exercise had begun, and I was conducting my very first real life mission in a blackhawk. I was pumped. We were going to pick up a squad of infantrymen and insert them into a village so they could go make tea or whatever it is the infantry guys do. When we get to the PZ, it turns out there is a whole platoon (30ish guys instead of 10) that needs to move, and I think, ""Badass. I get to do 3x as much cool army stuff today.""  On the first insertion, the IP I am flying with has me work the radios while he is on the controls as he knows I am still wet behind the ears and have never flown a mission like this before. We make our approach to the village, aircraft hauling ass until about 50 feet above touchdown, and the IP kicks the tail way out of trim to slow us down rapidly, pulls the nose up 10 degrees, and plants us softly between a barbed wire fence and a giant pile of rocks amidst the most outrageous dust cloud I have ever seen. I eat 3/4 of my seat cushion with the wrong end of my digestive system. The infantry guys pile out of the aircraft, snarling and scowling and infantrying as hard as they can. We take off and head back for the next load.  ""That's how we air assault LT. You gotta come in fast so the enemy doesn't shoot you. And we have to put the infantry guys down right where they asked us or we could give them a real bad day. Too easy."" I nod and say ""yep"" without keying the mic because I'm still trying to remember how many rotor blades my aircraft has and which one is the cyclic and which one is the collective.  Second load of troops goes exactly the same; we insert them to the same confined LZ, we get swallowed up by dust, and the IP does it all in a manner reminiscent of man tying his shoes, or maybe a fish swimming.  Third load. We pick up our ""crunchies"" (I'm told that's the sound they make if they don't get out of the way when you are on short final) and head towards the plywood village that is encountering so much strife. En route, we get a radio call accusing us of flying through a restricted area where artillery was firing. My IP, being the very manifestation of a Trojan warrior borne of the blood of Igor Sikorsky, George Patton, and Macho Man Randy Savage, gets upset. Very upset. He becomes entangled in a bitter dispute with the voice on the radio. The honor of mothers was challenged. The size of genitals were assumed. The volume required to activate the VOX was exceeded.  We are now on short final to the LZ, and my IP is still going at it. About 200 meters from the LZ, at 120 kts, the voice on the radio tells my IP to settle this issue with the command group on channel xyz, so he tells me ""You have the controls,"" and focuses his attention/wrath on the radio stack.  I black out, and twenty seconds later we are ascending out of the dust cloud on the LZ with our passengers running fearlessly into the face of a hellacious laser tag firefight. The controls are still in my hands, and my IP is now informing the command group via VHF radio which part of his anatomy to put in their mouths. We return to base after the mission and I fall asleep with my flight suit and survival gear still on.  TL;DR - I did a dust landing to a confined LZ with passengers on board about 12 flight hours after getting my certificate, and I've been picking seat cushion fabric out of my underwear ever since."

Helicopters,35cv8m,Casper29,3,Wed May 13 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Mine was on my discovery flight in a R22.  I always wanted to fly a helicopter but it always seemed out of my reach much in the same way that thoughts of ""I wish I could teleport"" were.  Well, one day I got serious about it and I booked a discovery flight.    Preflight briefing consisted of several warnings about drastic control inputs, I would have the controls during the flight, stay nice and smooth, etc... About half way through the flight my CFI had me get on the controls with him, and to me it felt like I was playing pretend and I figured that was going to be it since I was so green.  Barely moving the cyclic, hand just resting on collective, and feet on pedals, but I wasn't really doing anything because I could feel him flying and I was just following along.    We did that for about 5 minutes and he turned over cyclic and said that he would stay on with me.  Once I was straight and level for a while he later mentioned that he was ""going to scan for traffic, your controls"" and from my peripheral vision I could see both of his hands and feet off the controls.  His hands were only about 5 inches away from the teeter bar and could get back on before I got us in trouble. We were at 700 feet and around 65kts, and I was the only one on the controls.  My first thought was ""Holy hell, I'm flying!"" and my second thought was ""I'm not ready for this level of responsibility.""  I tried to emulate what he did and over-communicate what it was that I thought I should be doing before I did anything.  He is now my CFI and after 15 hours I know him to very cautious and not afraid to correct me if I am not doing what he wants."

Wikipedia and Boeing are two great places to start.  And my blog where I kept track of my training has two (I think good) bits of data too.  One and Two  But, simply put, the angle of attack (AOA) is the angle between the rotor blade and the wind it is traveling through.  There is a correlation between the angle and lift.  Too small of an angle, no lift.  Too large of an angle, aerodynamic stall conditions.  tl;dr:  A great YouTube Video."

Helicopters,35avh2,caross,3,Fri May 8 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"""I wanted to know how the angle of attack affects the lift of a commercial helicopter""  It's all about AoA.  Every time you make a cyclic input, the difference in AoA causes the tip path plane to move, moving the helo.  The collective does the same thing, except each blade changes AoA equally.  That's the basic answer anyway.  It gets a little more complicated when you start talking about flapping and blowback and such."
Helicopters,35avh2,Mikofthewat,1 point,Sat May 9 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"AOA=lift. The collective controls uniform AOA changes on the rotor blades, increasing or decreasing to produce desired lift."
Helicopters,35avh2,wolfshot,1 point,Fri May 8 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"Helicopter CFII and physics enthusiast here!  This is all very interesting stuff, and the rabbit hole goes deep! Here's the lift formula in its complex glory:   L=CL ½RSV²   What it means: L (Lift) = CL (Coefficient of Lift, Angle of Attack, pilot adjustable) ½R (R(roe)=Density Altitude, adjustable only by God, you have what you have) S (surface area of airfoil, fixed and unchangeable, as Chuck Meager says, ""unless you hit a tree"") V² (velocity squared, should be fixed, but there are some variables)  ... It gets more complex than this, though, as this formula only covers a section of the blade in one slice of time. The reality is that the blade is in such a dynamic environment that it's receiving different airflows from varying velocities, from its own flapping, from relative wind changes related to engine failures or ground effect, and etc. Complex, complex stuff and purely academic if you're trying to fly the things.  For the more pragmatic approach which might be useful since you're just getting into this stuff and don't want to be frightened away, and I'm assuming that you like physics principles:  Angle of attack is very closely tied to RPM, and I have to talk about both to talk about the physics of helicopters. I like knowing that total lift is a function of the angle of attack of the blade and the square of the rotor RPM (Frank Robinson lists it in his video as L ~ (AoA)*(Rotor RPM)2 (<<My god, watch that video if you want some helicopter knowledge slammed upon you). RPM translates into blade velocity. As an example, if rotor RPM drops to 80% you are at about 64% of your lift for the same angle of attack (0.80 * 0.80 = 0.64). Crazy, right? It's not linear, which is the relationship between the angle of attack and lift.   Similarly, if your engine dies, you have to be concerned about stored rotor energy. The formula Energy = Mass X (Velocity)2 will tell you, since rotor Mass is constant, that as your rotor RPM drops to our example of 80%, the energy left drops to 64%. That's important in an autorotation for properly stopping the descent rate. Again, it's not linear.   This is probably over your head, but the video is awesome. I highly recommend it for some interesting helicopter physics concepts.  You might want to look up rotor blade stall.   You also might want to look into induced drag with helicopters, as angle of attack affects it."

Some pick it up faster than others, some have natural air sense, some take extra time, but I'd say every RW pilot I know has a story about how hard it was to learn how to hover.  I went through the US Army's flight school at Ft Rucker, and it was funny to see all the egos in our flight school class. ""Oh yeah, I totally hovered today without the IPs help. I'm probably going to be the honor grad."" Sure pal. It doesn't count as hovering if you can't keep it inside an area the size of a tennis court. Guys would brag that they hovered all by themselves by the third day, or by their tenth hour, or that their IP didn't criticize them as much as their stick buddy, etc etc. The funny thing? Everyone knew how to hover by the time the check-ride came along. 90% of the class progressed to the next phase on the allotted timeline.

I didnt even bother researching what it'd be like. Boy was that intimidating! I could fly forward but barely. i was all over the place. i was extremely tense on the controls. My first couple flights i was pretty tense. The moment i relaxed my grip everything just started to click. I pretty much got a feel for the controls the moment i loosened up.

For about 5 minutes I was pretty all over the place, but miraculously, something kinda clicked, and I could keep it relatively still.

There are two reasons why it is taking you so long:  1. The school is taking you and your money for a ride... 2. You may not be suited to helicopters for what ever reason.

Helicopters,353t21,RotorHeadz,3,Thu May 7 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"What does your current instructor say is holding you back from soloing? I moved around a bit and took a break during training, so I'm familiar with the process of getting used to another instructor. I think its perfectly normal to feel a bit sloppy at the controls with someone new, but you'll get over that. Did you take a break from flying when your old CFI left? As for the knowledge, that bit is sorta on you. Just make sure you're hitting the books and keeping sharp. Did you take your written test yet?  From my experience, the different CFI personalities I've had during training was actually a good thing, but I wouldn't recommend my long and winding path to a license. The guy I finished up with was a bit of a hardass (in a good way) and definitely pushed me to finally get the checkride done, so in the end it worked out.  ""Pro"" tips from me would be the following:    Fly as often as you can (money and time allowing). At a min you I'd say you should be flying once a week; two would be ideal.  Chairfly. Sit yourself down in a chair and practice the motions of entering an auto, picking up to a hover, etc.  If you have time, listen to LiveATC at a busy airport. Try to visualize what's going on as you're listening to the radio. Practice the clearance readbacks, etc.  Get an R-22 cockpit poster (http://www.helicoptersonly.com/contents/en-us/d64.html) and practice going through your checklists.     Tips 2-4 are free (minus the cost of the poster) and can help you keep your head in the game while you're stuck on the ground."

I didn't take a break between instructors. Last week he said he went for an interview but wasn't expecting to get hired so fast. I didn't take the written test but I am hitting the books in preparation for it.   I fly once a week minimum, often 2 times a week, sometimes 3. I'll try out the chair, seems that will help since I can envision the cockpit. Live ATC actually helped out a lot, as i drive from work I have that playing on my car radio. I'll look into the poster, maybe I can find a free one :)   Thank you for the advise."

Everything /u/Suhweetusername suggested is exactly what i did almost everyday. it helped so much. i was constantly using images of the cockpit, i was watching videos on youtube of other students flights with instructors, chairflying is great! my radiowork was always more sloppy so i logged on to LiveATC and would practice my calls listening to that.

His facial injuries were the result of his striking the instrument glare shield during the impact sequence.  A95A0040: The pilot was not wearing his helmet during the flight. Although the pilot also suffered some head injuries, these head injuries were determined to be relatively minor.  A94W0147: A protective flight helmet likely would have prevented the pilot's head injuries.  A94Q0101: Because he was not wearing a helmet, the pilot suffered a concussion resulting in memory loss.  A93Q0237: If the occupants had been wearing helmets, their head injuries likely would have been less severe.  A91W0046: The pilot, who was not wearing a helmet nor the installed shoulder harness, suffered head and shoulder injuries.  A87P0089: The captain received minor head injuries which may have been prevented had he worn a helmet.  A87P0025: Had the pilot been wearing a helmet, some of the injuries to his head may have been prevented .  A87POO23: ...the pilot sustained minor facial injuries. He was not wearing a safety helmet at the time of the accident.  A86C0060: Had the pilot been wearing a helmet, it is possible that his injuries would not have been fatal.  A85P0011: The availability and wearing of a shoulder harness and a helmet would have prevented the injury.  Appendix B - TSB Occurrences - Head Protection Used  A07P0209: The pilot's flight helmet prevented life-threatening head injuries during the collision with terrain; many Canadian helicopter operators encourage their pilots to wear helmets in most operational environments.  A07W0150: The helmet and visor likely reduced his level of injury.  A05P0103: The pilot's helmet protected his head from severe injury, allowing him to extricate himself from the sunken wreckage.

Coincidentally the first day I wore the helmet there was a problem with the ignition switch in the helicopter and I had two power failures in three flights. Everything was fine, but I was glad I had a helmet. It is comfortable, quiet, and makes me feel a bit safer off-airport (I fly in the mountains). My biggest initial concern was that other pilots/ instructors would poke fun of me, but everyone was supportive and genuinely interested in the helmet. The utility guys wear their helmets on FS jobs, but I'm the only one that wears it in the R22. I wear a helmet when I ride a bike, when I ski, when I'm on a motorcycle... There is no reason I shouldn't wear one when I fly. It is a fact that they save lives. It is also a fact that the R22 is somewhat of a death trap. I'll take as much of an advantage in a crash as I can."

Yes they are allot more money (depends how much you value your life really...) and yes they are heavier so they are a bit less comfortable on your neck most likely but as far as safety there is really no question.... I think its all looks...   Also as a last thought, another downside would be the amount of space in a R22 and you would likely ding your helmet up real quick on everything."

ANR is definitely nicer on long flights; the CEPs get  painful after 5-6 hours. Neck strain has never been much of an issue for me. I like the built in visors and enclosed feel.

Once I clear the trees vertically, I can flip down my visor (especially if I have to rotate heading into the sun).

Helicopters,34rxlq,Machismo0311,3,Mon May 4 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"That's your choice, and every one of us has our own personal level of risk tolerance. My view point is, just like the flight suits, that I'm not going to sacrifice my level of safety just to save the feelings of my passengers. If they ask, it's always a simple explanation that while their time in the machine is limited, my exposure to the same risk is much higher due to how much time I spend in the cockpit compared to a casual customer.   There's nothing keeping a long term client/crew from also wearing PPE in the machine, and many do (Forestry, hydro, Law enforcement).  Tough titties if my helmet makes them uncomfortable. They're not the ones spending 300/500/1000 hrs a year in the cockpit, and they're not the ones responsible for the safety and wellbeing of everyone else on board should something go wrong. That's what they pay you for, the professional. And now you want to potentially decrease your ability to do so? Because it might make 1 in 100 people mildly uncomfortable? Screw that.   Do you also skip the portions of the safety briefing about the fire extinguisher, ELT, and survival kit because it makes some people nervous? I sure hope not.   Have you seen pictures of what a bird strike does to a cockpit? Who's going to have a better chance of landing an aircraft after a sparrow to the face: the guy that had a helmet on and visor down? Or the guy with David Clarks and Maui Jims?  Who's going to pull the unconscious front seat passenger to safety after a hard landing? The guy who was wearing his Gentex/Gallet/Alpha when he smacked his forehead on the dash? Or the guys who's face is now split open and his nose shattered.   Again, these are all what ifs and you can scale up any scenario to the point where it wouldn't matter if you were cocooned in your own personal fireproof bubble wrap shrine, and you still wouldnt survive. Point is, why would we not mitigate the risks that we are able to?  Look, I've been working in this industry since 2006, and yeah that's not a super long time compared to some of the actual veterans of our world, but it's long enough to form a decent sample size. I wear a helmet, flight suit, leather/nomex gloves, and decent shoes/boots every single flight.  Do you know how many times I've been questioned about my helmet (in a ""why do you have one but not me?"" capacity)? I could count them on 2 hands. Do you know how many times a passenger has turned around and gotten out of the helicopter because they saw me wearing a helmet? Zero. Do you know how many companies have let me go because my helmet and flight suit were making customers uncomfortable? Zero. I'm still employed, I still pick up jobs on a regular basis, I've been requested back by clients on more than one occasion.  You're not going to become a washed up pilot that people refuse to fly with just because you wear a helmet and a flight suit on a regular basis. What might end your career is losing the sight in both eyes because a duck came through the windscreen, or shaterring your orbital bone bouncing your face off the instrument panel in a botched autorotation from a high hover, or severe head trauma because a flapping blade took you in the back of the head as you were walking away from a spooling down machine (true story). Or worse.   You guys want to take your chances at becoming one of the negative statistics, that's your call. I hope your passengers don't suffer because of it.   Me, I'll take every damn tool available to me to help my chances if and when the shit hits the fan. I plan to lose clients because I end up doing this long enough to become a crochety old bastard that people don't want to fly with because my senile ramblings make them uncomfortable, not because of the protective gear I wear.   And I thus ends my pro-helmet rant for the morning. Fly safe folks! :D"

Helicopters,34qs4w,Av619,11,Sun May 3 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a safety memo I put together for our company. Read it and make your own decisions. (I'll try to link the figures it references)  TL;DR - It's heavily biased and pro flight suit  Taken from Transport Canada’s Aviation Safety Vortex 3/2004  Flight Suits — Functional Protection  On those hot summer days in the greenhouse (sometimes referred to as a cockpit), the desire to stay cool increases the temptation to shed protective clothing. We may even justify the decision to fly in shorts and T-shirt by telling ourselves that the risk of dehydration or overheating is higher than that of having an accident where a flight suit may come into play. But the fact is, a well-chosen combination of garments can give us the protection we need, and not significantly contribute to an internal thermal runaway. For some reason, many helicopter pilots in this country resist wearing a flight suit. There are usually a few standard reasons given for this — they are too hot, they look goofy, they are uncomfortable — but in fact, flight suits can be one of the most useful tools in the pilot's arsenal. In one neat package, you have a place to keep your licence wallet, pens, a small multi-tool, some tissue, sunscreen, a signal mirror, your ramp pass, a granola bar, etc. It provides excellent protection from UV radiation, keeps useful items on your person in the event of an accident where you are immobilized, and helps defend against the one we all worry about — fire. The reality is that a flight suit, and what you wear underneath it, could save your life.  Fabrics and Flammability  The most important factors to the level of protection provided to a wearer in a fire situation are ignitability, self-extinguishing characteristics, and behaviour when exposed to heat. A fabric's weave, the type of fibre, the size of the fibres in the weave, the density of the weave, and the thickness of the material affect these traits. How they burn if ignited can affect what they do to the wearer. Most synthetics for example, shrink before they melt. Some fuse into molten or burning globs, which drip on anything underneath them. The temperature at which they degrade is also important. Some of the common clothing fabric's fire characteristics are listed in Figure 1.  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Tests  In February 1997, a series of fabric burn tests were conducted at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) as part of the Aircraft Crash Survival Investigation course. The tests were intended to develop an understanding of the burning characteristics of the materials, including behaviour of the fabric when exposed to heat, and the time it took to consume the material. A test stand was constructed so that the sample could be suspended vertically over an alcohol burner (a relatively low temperature flame). Flame contact was limited to the lower edge of the fabric only. In each case, the flame was removed after the material started burning. Time of removal was subtracted from time to consumption. Each type of material was subjected to two test runs, and the times were averaged. The results are in Figure 2.  So, now we have seen the benefits of a fire-resistant suit over a flammable garment, but is that enough? No, it is not. The fact that the suit will not support flame or melt does nothing to prevent heat transfer to the skin. Therefore, what you wear under the flight suit is as important as the outer garment itself.  Testing done by DuPont, using their instrumented mannequin shows that an insulating layer under a fire-resistant flight suit can substantially reduce burn injury. In these tests, the mannequin was clad in a flight suit made from Nomex fibre that was developed for the Canadian Forces, and subjected to a three-second flash fire. In the first test, the mannequin was clad only in the flight suit. In the second test, the mannequin was wearing a second layer, consisting of short-sleeve T-shirt and briefs. Note the burns on the lower arms and legs as illustrated in Figure 3. In the third test, a second layer of long underwear made from Nomex fibre was used. IMPORTANT! It should be noted that these results were for the specific garments tested in a controlled environment. Their inclusion here is to illustrate the concept of an engineered approach to fire protection, and not a guarantee of actual protection.  Of course, the value and effectiveness of the insulating layer depends on the material chosen. There seems little point in wearing a flight suit made from Nomex if you’re going to wear polypropylene long underwear that will melt and fuse to your skin in a fire. An aramid or cotton garment is a much better choice. Fit is also very important — the suit should be loose-fitting to provide an insulating layer of air between the outer and inner clothing.  That covers the body area, but we should also apply the same logic to the head, hands, and feet. Leather boots are a safer choice than synthetic varieties, and should be coupled with natural or aramid fibre socks. Thin, fire retardant gloves are available, and quite comfortable. In fact, 5.11 makes a pair of short Nomex gloves that fit the bill if you’re not a fan of the longer “gauntlet” style pilot gloves."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,4,Sun May 3 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, /u/Av619 it sounds like you're head is in the right place. You shouldn't have to spend an arm and a leg on a flight suit, nor do you need to concern yourself with embroidery or epaulets (the shoulder deals) and whatnot.   A basic flight suit will just be like a set of coveralls. From there, you can add embroidery or just velcro patches to add your own items later (name, company, flags) but it's all superfluous. Better to spend your money on features like various pockets, leg clips, armpit vents, etc. Functional stuff.  Get a suit that's properly fitted for you. Common problems are the torso being too short, giving you a wedgie every time you sit/squat/reach overhead.  There are flight suits with removable sleeves, 2-piece suits, etc for hot weather environments.  Be wary of buying used, as suits can easily lose their retardant properties if washed too many times or washed incorrectly."

Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,3,Sun May 3 21:31:11 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no good reason why you shouldn't wear one, regardless of your status. Do students in motorcycle course not wear helmets or leather jackets? Do fire fighters in training run around in nylon track suits?  If someone gives you a hard time, tell them to go pound sand and/or show them a graphic photo of victims of a post-crash fire. The FAA should have plenty, though I'm not feeling morbid enough to go looking right now.  If you're legitimately worried about being given a hard time, just own it and show up with aviators, a Maverick callsign on your chest, and sporadically holler Top Gun references ""Yeehaaaw, Jester's dead!"", ""I feel the need!

Helicopters,34qs4w,dog_in_the_vent,6,Sun May 3 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"Flight suits are not fireproof and won't protect you if you're soaked in gasoline.  They're fire resistant, that's it.  You won't be able to walk through a pool of flaming gasoline just because you have a flight suit on.  The benefit that they give you is a barrier to heat if you're near a fire (just like most clothing), and they do not melt to your skin like Nylon and a lot of polyesters will.  That's it.  They're designed to not come apart if you had to use an ejection seat, and to not melt to you when exposed to heat.  Other than that, there's no benefit to wearing a flight suit.  Also remember that Nomex fire resistance degrades when you wash it, and even more so when you use fabric softener.  Just FYI."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,5,Sun May 3 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"So, other than those clear and obvious benefits you listed, there's no benefit. Got it ;)  Here's another one: they keep whatever you're wearing underneath clean(er) on a daily basis.  Excellent point on the fabric softener."

Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,2,Sun May 3 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone here is saying it will.   What it will do is hold up a lot better than most any non-flame resistant material. That much is proven. So, given there's no such thing as a magical fire suit, I'm not sure what you're getting at? Some protection is not any better than no protection? By that logic, why bother wearing a helmet since its not a magic crush proof brain container that will save your life in every conceivable scenario...  Why wear a seatbelt?"

I just don't want somebody paying a lot of money for a flight suit when it really won't protect them from fire.  It's kind of a misconception."

Helicopters,34qs4w,dog_in_the_vent,1 point,Mon May 4 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what type of crash you're planning on having.  My point is that a flight suit is not some kind of get out of fire free card.  It helps, but it's not fire proof like a lot of people think it is.  Wear a flight suit if you want.  It will help.  Just don't think you can roll around in a puddle of flaming gasoline and come out unburnt."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,2,Mon May 4 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"I think the point we're all making here is that a flight suit will help you in a survivable accident. As will a helmet, as will a seatbelt, etc etc.  If the accident is extreme, such as being doused in flaming gasoline, then the protection in question won't have made much of a difference, sure. Neither will a helmet if the whole transmission comes plowing through the cockpit post-impact. Neither will a seatbelt if you hit the side of a mountain at 130 Kts.  The PPE being discussed here, and elsewhere is just an added layer of protection. Not a total preventative measure, which is what you're saying and I don't think any of us disagree with that point."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,2,Mon May 4 05:42:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But I'll take some protection over none, any day.  Plus, what does a basic flight suit cost these days, $150?   I get not everyone will wear them, that's their call. But OP was pretty obviously looking for support, and personally I advocate wearing them, so if you can swing the expense, there's no legitimate downside to wearing them."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,2,Mon May 4 01:54:31 2015 UTC,I asked one of the higher up pilots at the company If i should wear a flight suit and he said not really... Im assuming he meant more the CFI side of things than the student side and im sure its all connected to looks since the company is pretty safe in all other aspects...
Helicopters,34qs4w,dog_in_the_vent,3,Mon May 4 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"Well to each their own, man. Based on looks alone then, I would still think a CFI wearing a flight suit would come off as more professional.   In any case, you're going to end up doing what you feel is best for the given situation so explore your options and best of luck!"
Helicopters,34qs4w,killtheslackers,2,Mon May 4 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"Other than the expense, there's no legitimate downside.  Just don't think it's some kind of space-age flame proof suit."

Helicopters,34qs4w,jpl77,3,Mon May 4 00:00:05 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I've been told by AF aircrew flight equipment airmen that it does.  Doesn't surprise me that they might be wrong though.  Fabric softeners are still a no-go though.

Helicopters,34qs4w,secretgspot,1 point,Mon May 4 07:28:18 2015 UTC,"They have their uses, but I wouldn't wear one in flight school. Especially not in a hot or moderate climate. That's just me though."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,-4,Thu May 7 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"nah, don't wear it unless it's for a job.  Passengers will feel really weird if you're wearing full gear and they just using a seat-belt.     While one should always wear a helmet, it usually not the case."
Helicopters,34qs4w,secretgspot,7,Sun May 3 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"Totally. You're 85% less flammable when flying non-commercially.   Fuck dude, go find some accident reports and images of people who have been in fires wearing synthetic fibers and then come tell me how you feel.   Its recommended for passengers to dress for conditions and to wear natural fibres where possible, if they don't that's on them. But how are you, the PIC going to be any good to anybody in a post crash scenario, if you're shrieking in pain because your rayon/polyester blend jacket has melted and now fused to your skin while still burning?  If you can make a case for always wearing a helmet, then you can make a case for always wearing a flight suit and/or non-synthetic fibres."
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,-4,Sun May 3 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"you're missing the point.  For example.  Lets say I have a photo flight and I come in dressed up all in Flight-suit, boots, gloves, helmet, life-vest.. the whole shabang and my passenger shows up in shorts and shirt with flip-flops.   While there is no problem with that, that passenger will feel like; ""OMG, I am under-dressed, are we going to crash and die?!?!?!""     Understand?       Of course I love to wear full gear because it makes me look cool in the mirror, but that's different situation.  If lets say I work on a Tuna boat and not a Tour provider, then yes, of course you should wear full gear."
Helicopters,34qs4w,secretgspot,10,Sun May 3 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"I see your point completely I just don't agree. Who gives  fuck what the passenger feels. You're the PIC and a professional. Part of being a professional involves being prepared for the job and the possible scenarios it entails. If a passenger showed up for a photo flight in shorts and flip-flops, I'd tell them they need proper footwear at a minimum. Shit gets cold with the doors off! ;)  I've had plenty of questions from passengers about my attire over the years, and all of them have been in regards to my hemet and none about the flight suit. Regardless, I usually address their concerns explaining it's a concept of risk exposure: they're only in the helicopter for 15min, 1 day, whatever but I work every hour of my career in the helicopter, thus statistically I'm more likely to need my PPE.  At the end of the day, what you wear is your own decision, though I find it odd your reason for wearing full gear is ""it makes me look cool in the mirror"". Usually it's the opposite: guys think flight suits and helmets look stupid and/or are an encumbrance. I know lots of people don't wear flight suits, or helmets, and some like to fly in shorts etc... but don't advocate ""less-safe"" practices to an up and coming pilot, man.  Lastly, I found the Tuna boat vs Tours example off because of all places a Tuna boat is the most likely place you'd see a pilot wearing a t-shirt and flip flops and the Tour operators I've seen would want to maintain a consistent and professional image and would be the more likely of the two to insist on wearing flight suits.  Anway, I'm sorry for the rant man. I'm not trying to pick on you, but it's a slow day in camp and you awakened the Flight Ops QA guy in me ;)"
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,5,Sun May 3 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"passengers pay your bill, it sometimes comes down to situations like, Ohh last time this pilot was grumpy, I don't want to fly with him anymore.  Either provide me another pilot or I'll go fly somewhere else, and company will ground you to please that customer.    A while back it was very prestigious to be a pilot, you would get respect left and right, now... they treat you like a fucking taxi driver.   WTF?!?! You're 15 min late,  I don't give a shit about head wind!!   WTF, YOU'RE CHARGING ME $50 for waiting for 3 hours for me?!?!!?  WTF?!?! WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG?!?!  FLY FASTER, I AM NOT PAYING FOR ANOTHER HOUR! (flying into strong head wind).     We have a saying/inside joke here;  3 types that work holidays and weekends?   Taxi drivers, Hookers and Pilots!  Besides all that, depending on where you are, it might be too hot to wear flight suit or helmet.  I am in tropics and while it does feel cold in some parts of this country, mostly it's very hot.    Besides, helicopters don't usually burst into flames and in most cases you can land it with minimal damage.  If damage is severe, I don't think it really matters if you only wear helmet.   On Tuna I would wear full gear because I have to be out in the water 8 hours a day, I would probably fly with mini life raft too.  I think the reason a lot of people don't wear uniform is because they think it look stupid flying r22/r44 in it.  It's like wearing full body racing suit and driving a moped.  TIP:  If really falling, try to fall tail first into tree trunks, both will act as a spring and motor/gear will act as a shield."

And you're right about the pickiness of customers of course, though it's far more likely an issue will arise from grumpiness than your choice of attire.   If your company doesn't want to back you up, well... that's a an issue with your choice of employer then. I wish it wasn't as common an issue as it seems to be in our industry :("
Helicopters,34qs4w,HeliBif,4,Sun May 3 21:15:04 2015 UTC,"yup, that's my problem with it..  I didn't pay $100k+ to be treated like a taxi driver and be told by the bosses I should thank them for giving me opportunities.   I really want some small operation of my own"
Helicopters,34qs4w,secretgspot,3,Sun May 3 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're in the wrong industry then, my friend!

Helicopters,34ql4p,HeadnCloud9,14,Sun May 3 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"""Do not let yourself be forced into doing anything before you are ready.""   Personally, I solo'd at 30 hours. However, when you can only fly once or twice a week, or forced to have pauses due to weather that can knock a week or two off, you don't get the sort of efficiency of learning and constant reinforcement you might get had you flown every day.    At the end of it all, though, when you solo you will have nothing but yourself to rely on to keep you alive.  While it's good to push yourself a little, if you don't think you're safe, that is not a bad reason to put it off as long as you keep pushing forward to have the competency you need to do so. Safety first and foremost, right?"
Helicopters,34ql4p,axisaver,7,Sun May 3 18:24:39 2015 UTC,"How about a different instructor for a few hours?  I not suggesting you offend your current instructor but if ""he feels he not doing something right"" then he shouldn't be.  Sometimes a different perspective, preferably one with more experience or a different background, can make all the difference.  2 of my helicopter instructors had flight times in the 20,000 hour range!  For me, flying with them was a COMPLETELY different experience."
Helicopters,34ql4p,Canadian47,1 point,Sun May 3 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"This, I had issues with my primary instructor and didnt really address it until after I had completed my commercial and was working on endorsements.

Helicopters,34ql4p,fivechickens,5,Mon May 4 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"First time I wasn't ready for solo and I told my instructor I wasn't ready, so he tricked me by telling me he needed to take a leak while I should keep the chopper running on the ground, he walked out with walki talki and then told me  go ahead and hover while I piss!  As I got to hover which was really weird first time since all weight goes to your side, he told me to do a pattern around.     That was super scary pattern, flying around is no big deal, scary part was when I was doing short final and try to lower the collective and it seemed like no matter how much I lower it, helicopter doesn't want to go down.   I ended up waaay over-shooting my landing spot and went go around, after 3rd time I was able to land and that was my first solo."
Helicopters,34ql4p,secretgspot,2,Sun May 3 19:18:37 2015 UTC,My instructor did almost the exact same thing. I felt like I was maybe about 70% in control of the helicopter lol

Helicopters,34ql4p,HeliBif,4,Mon May 4 01:43:40 2015 UTC,"Dude don't worry about it. Your main disadvantage is that you're learning part-time. So, every time you show up for another flight, part of that time is spent remembering what you learned previously. Most of the people I know who solo'd in the 20-30 range were training full time, as was I. Meaning we flew 1 or more flights per day, every day.   You're doing fine, just get out of your own head about it and you'll solo when you're good and ready."

Helicopters,34ql4p,achemze,3,Mon May 4 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll ever truly feel ""ready"" to solo. Even at my finest hour, the second my instructor was gone ... it got real.   My first solo, i had to do 3 go arounds before i could get an approach to stick. I literally had a moment of thinking ""we've got an hour of fuel for you to figure out how to get enough decel on this thing to hit a spot"".  The way I heard it is ... when your instructor thinks you're ready, you're ready."
Helicopters,34ql4p,zippyajohn,3,Mon May 4 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"Chill out, you're at 27 hours. Most students don't solo until the 30s. I had some foreign students that didnt solo until 50 or so hours. You shouldn't be worrying about it right now. Just make sure your instructor is being clear about what to improve on and how to improve it and you'll be good."

Helicopters,34ql4p,Torkin,2,Sun May 10 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"He has some idea in his head about when someone ""should"" solo by. Don't give it a second thought. Solo when you are ready. No one should give a shit what your hours were when you did your first solo. I don't have a clue anymore of how many hours I had when I soloed; it makes absolutely no difference."
Helicopters,34ql4p,pseudo_noob,2,Sun May 3 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is absolutely correct.  Don't worry about how many hours it takes.  Your only concern should be about being able to fly safely.  As someone else mentioned, try taking a flight or two with another instructor.  If there are particular maneuvers that you are struggling with, let this other instructor know.  I've seen students struggle with certain things, but having another instructor explain/demonstrate it in another way made it click for them.  Also, try a few patterns with your instructor simply sitting quietly in the other seat.  You will have the safety of having him in the aircraft, but it may help your confidence by doing the patterns without any help or input."
Helicopters,34ql4p,Siaress,2,Sun May 3 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for the responses. I didn't even think anything of it until this past week when during our flight the instructor mentioned that our last few flights have been stressful for him. Once on the ground I addressed it. That's when he said he's wondering if he's not doing something right, and he said that out of 4 female students he's ever taught, 2 washed out, and I don't remember what happened to the other two but I'm pretty sure they didn't make it either. And that I'm off course for solo.  Well, now I'm trying to understand this. What am I doing differently from other students? Sometimes I turn into the x-wind leg too soon (there are a bunch of fields and coves that look almost identical right right next to each other so I may turn at the wrong one), sometimes I'm not right at 300ft and 60KIAS on final, and sure sometimes I'm out of trim. But I'm really good at handling wind and reaching my target spot.  I just thought that all of those other things will come with practice, it's not as though I don't know those things need to happen, I just need to practice it.  So since I don't have any other point of reference, I'm wondering what is different about how I'm learning? What could be stressful about flying with me?"
Helicopters,34ql4p,G--Man,3,Mon May 4 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Don't stress about the way you're learning vs. everyone else. Some things you're gonna pick up faster than others. Your instructors job is to find what's wrong and present a solution on how to fix it. If he can't recognize the things you're struggling with, he shouldn't be an instructor. If it were the student's responsibility to detect issues there would be no need for instructors.   That being said, some people just simply take longer to get the hang of things. There's a student at my old flight school that is around 60 hours without soloing. My buddy from Texas solo'd at about 15 hours, but it took him almost three years of flying three days a week to get his private. The journey toward the PPL is by far the most varied in terms of average completion. I'd highly recommend getting a second opinion from a different instructor. Your current CFI should not have ever let on that training you was ""stressful"", even if he really felt that way (which isn't fair to you as a relatively new student). It isn't conducive to a positive learning environment."
Helicopters,34ql4p,Thatdamnginger,3,Mon May 4 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"Do not use ground references for your traffic pattern, use the landing point and reference everything on that, until, you start doing confined areas."

Called ""Chrysalis"" is unveiled in 1913 and consists of a 17m wing that revolves around the cockpit, powered by a 80hp engine positioned opposite arm and which propels air at 100m / s through the wing to an oval loophole placed perpendicularly to its end.  Part of the air is diverted to prevent cockpit turning.  Unforeseen technical difficulties and the outbreak of the First World War delayed the first test could take place March 31, 1915 on the Cercey of reservoir in Côte-d'Or.  The engine used is not powerful enough, especially since an imbalance produced by the wing has forced manufacturers to weigh the unit; after becoming airborne the vehicle became unstable and eventually sink.  The test was considered non-conclusive by military commission for the evaluation will recommend stopping trials.

Helicopters,33o7cy,stephen1547,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"The flight school signs off on some sort of allowance that let's you fly solo in their machine as part of the training requirement.   Beyond the CPL, the only way to build time is get a job, or be rich enough (or know someone who's rich enough) to own a helicopter."

It ended up getting busy at a couple points so the little curveballs they threw my way were kinda exciting! I ended up holding downwind for like 10 minutes so I just cruised around over some of the neighborhoods and checked out everyone's disgusting properties haha but other then that it wasn't too exciting...Just felt incredible once I landed! Great feeling knowing I can do it all my own. Now I'm flight planning for a couple longer flights."
Helicopters,33ebh0,Cropgun,3,Tue Apr 21 22:39:37 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I've always wanted to do something like that, but never really looked into it.  How many hours of book learning did you have to go through before getting into the seat?"
Helicopters,33ebh0,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"None if you count the intro flight as being in the seat. you can start flying right off the bat. I study as I go and it's been pretty good. There's certain requirements for training on the ground (your book type studying) with an instructor before you can even get your license. So you kinda do it as you go and your instructor will help guide you. Start with the basics to study, then you go fly to apply what you studied. A lot of the learning comes from doing it first hand and developing a feel for it. The studying just helps you understand what you're about to do. The more you study on your own, the less you'll have to pay for instruction time on ground. After some hours of flight, the studying increases a bit because you start learning emergency procedures and airport operations. If it's something you think you'll like doing, go book an intro/discovery flight! I just decided outta no where that it sounded fun so I made a call. I had no knowledge about flying at all prior to the intro flight. I doubt you'd regret it one bit. It's very addicting."

Helicopters,331ne4,secretgspot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"Best way to get into AG is to find some local operators and just go talk to them. Most guys will work on the ground for a season or two so the operator can see if you're worth spending the time and money to train. You will also get to know all the chemicals that are being used, and what the ground guys are trying to do when you tell them to do something.   Most don't like the idea of flying around low and fast. Wires can literally jump out of nowhere and grab ya. You're always looking for everything that can kill you, watching your speed, your height, your AG computer, the light bar, the nozzles, your fuel, the winds.   It can get tricky.

Helicopters,3317oi,Maeryne,1 point,Wed May 6 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's a Boatpix operation. Boatpix works a bit differently than a regular flight school. Basically what they do (after talking to the owner, Tommy McDermott, in Las Vegas) is charge you for a large block of flight hours in advance of your training and get you all the way through your certified flight instructor rating. Once you achieve your CFI, you work for the company doing photo flights and subsequent flight training until you achieve a certain number of hours. I'm not sure how the payments or anything work specifically, but maybe someone on here knows better.  They have locations all along the coastal areas of the US and seem to be doing well for themselves. I know a few people who went through them and were currently employed. Opinions vary from person to person in regards to their training methods (since the focus of the flight seem to be the photography rather than strictly training). I'd recommend contacting them directly, checking out their pricing and operations first hand. I'd recommend doing a discovery flight (basically a short intro ground/flight lesson) to make sure it's something you really want. If you feel it is, consider getting an aviation medical exam and certificate (first or second class preferably) to avoid wasting your money if for some reason you're deemed unfit to fly. After that, if there are any other schools at all in your area give them a visit as well. Let us know what you find out and good luck!"

Helicopters,32sb3n,doodlewhale,2,Thu Apr 16 08:52:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure what is on the BSc, as this is a new style of course in the UK. Pilot degree programmes have been around a while elsewhere, but not here. The required reading for ATPL(H) essentially consisted of course notes/manuals from the ground school training provider, in my case Bristol.GS. They are used by some integrated facilities and widely used by those of us on the modular professional licence route, and you may find older copies of their manuals on online auction sites.  The general textbook situation is a little poor for the rotary world. When I did my PPL(H) I was advised to use Wagtendonk's Principals of Helicopter Flight for the technical exams and some of that knowledge came in useful for the ATPL(H) exams. It is available on Amazon here https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1560276495/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_Jk8lvb0192FZT  Sorry I can't be of more use, as I say these courses are new and I understand some within the industry are little dubious about them as they are seen (a little) as a way of milking the student loan system.

Helicopters,32nkfb,achwas,6,Wed Apr 15 05:30:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all ""mustering"" videos on youtube are just guys showing off as if there was some sort of a competition who can hit the stops on the cyclic the most. In reality you would get your ass fired if you flew like that except in rare circumstances.  This video shows what the average mustering operation really looks like from the air. You can see how the pilot closely watches the reaction of the cattle, carefully positions the machine accordingly, and then lets them do their own thing once they start going the right way. And guess what, in the end they all end up in the yard without any aerobatics, and most importantly without keeling over from heat stress. Doesn't look as spectacular as that bullshit clip the BBC shot a few years ago, but I think this is a lot more satisfying (and less infuriating) to watch.  The video is by Graeme Gillies, the name will ring a bell for those who have flown down there."

People do this work right out of flight school (generally doing their first 100hrs as dual so they don't die), but 98% of them these days grew up out there and have previously mustered on bikes or horses. There are typically at least a few guys on bikes on the ground, sometimes more. The pilot is expected to coordinate the whole thing from the air, so they better know how to run the show. In my experience, the majority of mustering pilots these days never do anything else, they are Cowboys at heart. Met plenty of people with 10,000hrs+ in R22s and nothing else out there."

However, when the ship approached, the firefighters on the ground could not establish communications with the pilot.  The pilot landed slightly off the pad, and when he cut power the ship tipped back to the position in your picture.    The crews then cut a new helispot, and evac'd the injured firefighter in a different ship. Then, the firefighters righted the first helicopter and improved the pad so that the ship could sit level and eventually fly away.  Great story of problem solving, and an all-too-rare happy outcome.

Helicopters,32i6fb,firesgood,5,Tue Apr 14 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"I can only guess, but possible reasons might include:   He was low on fuel and seeing as the patient wasn't on site and ready to load he chose to shut down to conserve fuel (yeah, we know from the video that the patient was just around the corner, but he likely didn't know.)  He was unfamiliar with how savvy the firefighters around him were with working around helicopters and felt the scene would be safer with the rotors stopped (most wildland firefighters have some basic familiarity with working with helicopters, but only some have specific training for working closely with them on the ground, and as an EMS pilot, I wouldn't expect him to know that anyway.)  He may have had a company policy against using a spot that required a ""fly the ship while on the ground"" technique - for instance, the US Forest Service requires us to only use spots which allow all the weight of the aircraft to be placed on the skids - if it's at all toe-in,  it's forbidden.

Helicopters,32i6fb,firesgood,2,Wed Apr 15 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes rocks are moved to clear a touchdown area, but yeah, usually no dirt work. Stumps near the touchdown point will usually be ""low stumped"", cut off as low as can be with a chainsaw. Immovable hazards (rocks, roots, stumps)  will often be flagged and a touchdown point will usually be marked with an X of flagging or a rock wrapped in flagging in the center.  Commonly used guidance for US Federal firefighters constructing a helispot is found in the IRPG (Initial Response Pocket Guide) starting on page 49 (looks like that's page 65 of the PDF).   As /u/stephen1547 said, sometimes logs or log rounds will be used to help level or build up a pad. I've seen some excellent work done with log rounds to create an LZ on a very narrow ridge, but I always treat any spot like this as subject to failure, and I'll keep the aircraft light enough that if a log slipped or rolled, I would be able to catch it and not end up like the aircraft we're discussing here (I hope!).  Once created, a helispot needs to be approved by a helicopter manager, who will usually accompany the first flight to the new spot and discuss it's merits and any problems with the pilot before approving it.  This step is both to fine tune the spot if it's good, or to rule out it's use if it has unacceptable hazards, rather than allowing us cowboy pilots to just keep daring each other to use a sketchy spot ;-). I couldn't determine from the video if this step had been completed (it wasn't mentioned, which makes me think it wasn't accomplished given the thoroughness of the report in general), and given that the aircraft involved hadn't received any briefing (I assume, since he didn't have the frequencies in his radio), he was likely the first to assess the spot.  It may very well be that some hazard ahead of the ship made it uncomfortable for him to move any farther forward, so the rear of the skids didn't quite make it to where they needed to be... Had the spot been vetted by a manager and agency approved pilot, perhaps the spot could have been improved a bit to help in that regard (it would probably only take a few minutes to drop a couple trees to widen the spot out if that's what it needed, but if you don't work with hotshots all the time, you likely wouldn't realize what quick work they can make of that sort of thing and if you don't have the frequencies, you can't tell anyone how to improve anything). Of course, I wasn't there, so that's just conjecture on my part. All in all a damn fine outcome given that the aircraft was able to fly away under it's own power."

Most helitack crews will have three or four managers on the crew, so you usually have someone with you who can do the approval on the fly, and if you're doing something like initial attack, you'll have a manager for sure, so you're golden (of course it's actually the pilots doing the approval, the manager just has veto power if there's something they don't like).    I have known some guys who were fighting fires with helicopters back in the old days when it was the wild west - a lot of machines were wrecked back then, and a lot of people killed, the rules are a reaction to that history."

Helicopters,322cq2,Fapmiester,3,Fri Apr 10 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"The main reason for the cancellation of the Comanche project was its unfortunate timing. Leading up to the cancellation of the Comanche project, everyone high up in the government was trying to reduce overall spending. Politicians cited the need for reducing the amount of people in harms way by investing in unmanned aircraft which at the time was cheaper than the Comanche Project.   Those are the facts. Personally, I loved the Comanche. It was my dream heli. Imagine a stealth heli that can fly about 90 kts sideways with armament. My father was one of the first Army Blackhawk pilots when they were called Deathhawks. Growing up, one of my best friends father (former Cobra pilot) was one of the leads on the Comanche Project and we got to play in the only simulator which was at Ft. Rucker. So, you could say I am a little biased, but it was a fucking amazing bird."

Helicopters,3236o2,M230,3,Fri Apr 10 08:03:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  From the Virginia statute: "" ... laser, laser gun sight, or any other device that simulates a laser ...""  Interesting to see what the courts will interpret ""any other device which simulates a laser"" to mean.  I think there is a bit of a vagueness problem there.  Someone who is both a scientist and a lawyer would tell you that nothing ""simulates"" a laser and if the legislature meant to say ""bright light"" then it damned well could have said so.  The Texas statute at issue in the second example is much more clear as to the devices prohibited:  ""(a) A person commits an offense if:  ""(1) the person intentionally directs a light from a laser pointer or other light source at an aircraft; and  ""(2) the light has an intensity sufficient to impair the operator's ability to control the aircraft.  ""...  ""(c) An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor unless the intensity of the light impairs the operator's ability to control the aircraft, in which event the offense is a Class A misdemeanor.""  I do notice, however, that the statute seems to contain a nonsensical distinction between Class C and Class A misdemeanor treatment.  One can never be eligible for Class C misdemeanor treatment because only conduct eligible for Class A misdemeanor treatment is actually a violation of the statute.  But Texas, so what can I say?"

Spotlight was while I was on short final to a dyke. The light came from about 500' away and I saw it turn on out of the corner of my eye. I glanced over at it just as he aimed it at me. To describe what it looked like, hold 2 fingers directly in front of your eyes, 1"" away.  I had to land with my peripheral vision and turn the tail towards the light.

Helicopters,3236o2,iamkokonutz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Lasers are hard to get in high candle power, as compared to a spotlight. It's easier to get a hold of a spot with enough lumens to flash blind you really good.  What's scary about the lasers, is that the coherent light they produce actually damages the receptors in your eyes. They don't flash blind you as bad, instead doing permanent damage. Luckily most people only have red ones, that can barely do anything at range. The green and blue ones are seriously dangerous for your eyes, even at hundreds of yards.  Stay safe from those assholes. I hope you never get lit up again."

Helicopters,3236o2,secretgspot,2,Fri Apr 10 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"If you're flying at night in a combat zone you're generally not up full FAA illumination, making it pretty challenging to figure out where the helicopter is, if you can hear it in the first place. Second, depending on the local situation, that could be interpreted as a hostile act and you just brought a flashlight to a gunfight against a helicopter BUILT to kill things in the dark. Third, there's very little you can do to get around the physiology of the eye at night. You need to see in order to fly, there's no getting around it. Visually aided night flight is about the best protection you'll get outside of laser rated night visors."
Helicopters,3236o2,Cerebro64,0,Fri Apr 10 20:09:06 2015 UTC,I  would assume with all these millions poured into something like a combat helicopter they would have polarized glass + all sorts of shields that would diffuse outside light.  Almost makes me think they should eliminate windows and install cameras all around to give 360 unobstructed view which can filter such events as laser pointer or sun glare
Helicopters,3236o2,secretgspot,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"And you just described the F35 optics system, which even with modern technology, is still having issues. Second the more layers you put between the eye and something you wish to look at, the greater the chance you won't see it. Even with anal retentive transparency care, they all degrade over time. It's possible that you might have to look through 4 separate transparencies  to see something, it's already hard enough to see with the naked eye. Third, lasers and canopies don't mix. Often resulting in a refractory effect likened to a disco ball. Finally, given that it's a combat helicopter, if the enemy can accurately illuminate you with a light or laser, there's a good chance that the light/laser will be shortly followed by far moving physical objects, which the aircraft is built to handle.  The end result of all that is the Army decided the best way to manage a lasing event was with specially coated visors. I've never laid hands on one before though."

Helicopters,31zcfp,SeafoodGumbo,9,Thu Apr 9 09:48:46 2015 UTC,"Jumping the Gun...  Near Rubidoux, California  April 26, 1987    A License to Learn…    Cline Hogg was born in 1929 in Kinchafoonee, Georiga.  Part of a large family, he himself beget a large family, fathering five children, and was a step-father to three more.    In the late 1960s, and after the birth of his last child, Hogg decided to begin to save some money, and buy a helicopter.  The final fiscal touch came after Hogg received some settlement money from a work related accident    In 1987 – twenty years after the start of his dream – Hogg purchased his dream helicopter, a Hughes 269B, for $26,000.  Registered as N101DN, and powered by a 190 horsepower Lycoming HIO-360-A1A engine, the helicopter featured a three seat cockpit and flight controls that are directly linked to the control surfaces, eliminating any need for hydraulics.    Hogg had earned his private pilot’s certificate for fixed-wing aircraft, and had flown over 500 hours.  The addition of a rotorcraft rating seemed to be a simple, yet challenging, proposition to the 58-year-old.    Kickoff of a Dream…    On the morning of April 26th, 1987, Hogg was waiting for his instructor on the runway at Flabob Airport (KRIR), near Riverside, until about 11:30 AM, when he apparently decided to activate some of the controls of the chopper, despite being told by his instructor to wait for him and not to touch anything.    Hogg, eager to begin, started the aircraft, ran the engine up to full RPM, and then began to increase the collective pitch control.  He claimed he never intended to leave the ground, but slowly, the helicopter climbed vertically to a high hover, fluttering up to around 75 feet.    But, he had not released the cyclic friction before becoming airborne. With no warning, Hogg lost control, and the helo plummeted back to the tarmac below. Video of Hogg's takeoff, and resulting crash, hosted by YouTube  ""When it flipped over, one rotor hit the roadway and threw it all out of control,"" Hogg said to reporters after the crash. ""I tried to straighten it out but it bounced all over and disintegrated.""    And the entire catastrophe was caught on video by a friend of Hogg's, hoping to capture what was expected to be Hogg's first copter flight.    Fumble!    Surprisingly, according to Riverside County Sheriff's Sergeant Chris Coplen, Hogg was uninjured by the mishap.  But Hogg claimed to have sustained a deeper wound - ""The only thing broken on me was my heart,"" said Hogg. He had saved 20 years for the $26,000 helicopter, but did not have it insured, and the wreck was a total loss.    According to John Baginski of Moreno Valley, who witnessed the accident, ""The guy is a miracle survivor.""    ""The old man upstairs decides when it's your time to go,"" Hogg said. ""Any landing that you walk away from is a good landing.""    Flag on the Play…    In April of 1989, the National Transportation Safety Board released their conclusion as to the probable cause of the crash.  The Board determined the probable cause was that directional control was not maintained, and poor judgment was exhibited, by the student, in connection with an uncontrolled vertical takeoff – all of which was caused by the student’s disregard to his instructor’s instructions.    Cline Hogg continued to reside in Fontana until 2002 with his wife, Zee.  He passed away in Geneva, Ohio, on November 19th, 2006. http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Hogg-N101DN.htm"

Another cause is a high rate-of-descent that, in combination with the gross weight of the aircraft, results in a lot of inertia in a descending direction—more inertia than can be easily arrested by full engine power.  Therefore, a high ROD, usually paired with high gross weights, can also cause ""settling with power"".   So, two different causes (VRS and high ROD/GW) can result in SWP.  So, to say that SWP can only happen when you run out of power is incorrect, it ignores the fact that VRS can also cause SWP, and can do so at even low power settings."

I know nothing about that aircraft, how many hours it has, how it's been flown, if it's been serviced, or who has been performing the work. I've seen charter jet rangers with a gearbox dipstick that looks like the back of a pokie pine from all the gear shavings. And crop dusting jet rangers that look like there in amazing condition. But in general if I had to pick, sight unseen, to fly a utility vs privately owned helicopter, I would pick privately owned. I was really just answering the question of why someone wouldn't want to fly this aircraft over another one given the choice."

Helicopters,31syno,jdps27,8,Wed Apr 8 09:04:51 2015 UTC,"According to the pilot, shortly after he took off the clutch warning light came on.  He did not think this was abnormal because the belts will heat up and re-tension themselves causing the light to briefly illuminate. However, as a precaution, and as directed by the manufacturer, he waited to see if the light would go out in 10 seconds. The light did not turn off, so he pulled the clutch circuit breaker and landed immediately in a parking lot. After landing, the pilot locked the controls, got out of the helicopter and looked inside the engine compartment.   He did not see anything abnormal. At this point, the pilot said a group of young men, who ""didn't look friendly"" were waving their arms and saying that he wasn't allowed to land there. The pilot was unable to find his cell phone to call for help, so he elected to get back in the helicopter and make the short flight back to the airport. The pilot then departed and was about 500 yards from landing on runway 5, when the helicopter began to vibrate and ""make a lot of noise."" The pilot entered an autorotation. He said, ""As I slowed and did the flair to land the helicopter yawed to the left as I pulled collective to run it on. I realized there was no tail rotor. The skids contacted the ground and dug into the soft ground.. I think that's when the tail boom lifted and the blade cut it off.""   The helicopter was retained for further examination."

If you're going to go for a piston look into an R44 or R66 (if you want a turbine). Much more power and room in both plus the cruise speed is 115kts or more.

Modern (by helicopter standards), user friendly, useful and roomy cabin layout and baggage room, fast, smooth, powerful, no C of G problems, quick start and shutdown etc. Get an older BA and it's not even that expensive. On a piston budget i'd get a R44 Raven I unless you live at higher altitude in which case the R2 is worth it.  Jet Rangers are ok I guess. For a private owner I don't necessarily see much benefit over an R44 to justify the higher operating cost  h369 (500) variants are fun to fly but not so much fun to own and no fun for the passengers. Like a Ferrari? Yeah but in more ways than just the flying..  H269/300 are on the way out with quickly fading factory support. Expensive and slow, clearly an outdated machine in every way  R22 only makes sense if you don't carry passengers. Fun to fly as a single pilot aircraft but useful load is miniscule. An R44 r1 doesn't cost much more to run but is so much more useful, and safer"

I like the speed of the R22, along with the convenience of the governor. The lower operational costs are something to consider as well. I do not like the low rotor inertia or autos in it.   Personally, I feel safer in the S300. Quite a bit safer. It doesn't whack around a lot (in yaw, lateral, or longitudinal) and has a TON of rotor inertia by comparison. It's super squishy when you set down, like ""Did we just land?"" sometimes. Ground resonance is something to consider. Unfortunately, I have heard that they stopped making parts for the S300, and big flight schools like Bristow are parting out bits of their fleet to service the rest of the helicopters they have. Hearsay, but I haven't heard anything on the contrary. That's something to look into. Also, it tops out at maybe, on a good day, 90 knots with 2 people. Full throttle.   I have seen the Guimbal G2 in flight, and I have read up a great deal on it. If I could own a helicopter without any stick time in it, I would definitely consider that one. As of yet, everything but the engine is replace-on-condition, meaning that in 20 years, if it's still serviceable, you could have the same tailboom, same blades, same drivetrain, etc. That should be a money saver. It has some flight control quirks, but it has passed European safety tests, it sounds badass, it looks badass, has a cargo compartment, it seems to handle well, range/speed comparable or better than a 172, and rotor inertia is higher than on the S300. (cleans drool from keyboard). Maybe someone else can chime in on that, but that would be my pick."

Helicopters,31wiod,zippyajohn,4,Wed Apr 8 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The ""loophole"" is real and the language outlining funding for these programs needs to be much more specific.

Almost to the point where they made it sound as though the helicopter programs in general were a loophole allowance. The associated bill in front of Congress moves to all but strike helicopter training from supported programs. My new points were that the system is working as it was meant to, that schools and flight schools are working together to legally follow the law, and offer an excellent program at a fair rate to Vets. That the problem isn't all the programs and that shouldn't be the drive behind any action - that the focus needs to be on the abusing parties.

One student took the private course 3 times, instrument twice, commercial once, and CFI twice. Each time he went through another semester of training and another semester's worth of hours! Some students were finishing up training around 300-400 hours! One student admitted that he was gave up because he ""could just retake the course"".

So as many times as the take it, if they're planning on maximizing their benefits, or even finishing, they have only that long to do so. Once you start the clock, it doesn't stop ticking. You only get 36 months of benefits under the new program, then you're done.   So in a traditional four year degree situation, where most students take five or six years to finish, vets don't have the option of runover without having to foot their own bill."

Students academic progress is reported to the VA through the college, any classes passed with less than a C average, the Vet has to pay back the BAH for - because our agreement with the VA is that not only will we pursue a degree, but will pass classes, and move forward on that degree.   Without knowing more about how the ULA/GA/UHI programs are structured these days I'm not sure how they got around that rule with the flight labs, but given that I had to send in reports on all our students every quarter, the guys at those schools must have figured a way around that."
Helicopters,31wiod,Azhigher,3,Sat Apr 18 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"I am a vet who is looking into a few of these schools. My biggest fear is that these schools will be flooding the job market with pilots. In the recent article they stated ULA has 197 students. That seems like a lot to me, am I right for being concerned or is there a market for that many new pilots coming in?"
Helicopters,31wiod,HelicopterJockey,2,Wed Apr 8 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"What they don't mention is the attrition rate, a lot of vets start the program get counted in numbers like that and then don't finish or choose not to follow this as a career path. For those of us that stick it out it really is a struggle on the low time side of things to get a good job - there is a lot of competition, this serves as another ""filter"" for people that aren't willing to dig in, relocate, live in a trailer at a job site. The truth is, there are jobs. And HAI says that Helicopter industry is growing rapidly. Vietnam vets are retiring in droves. Youjust have to be willing to dig deep, take meager conditions at first, and work into those reallly ideal flying jobs.   The EMS community can't find enough pilots at all. Look at the job sites like jsfirm.com and you'll see nothing but wall to wall ads for HEMS pilot positions."
Helicopters,31wiod,Azhigher,6,Thu Apr 9 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"LOL.  Vietnam pilots are still retiring in droves?  There must have been millions of them because they have been retiring in droves since the '80s.  The problem with the helicopter industry is nobody wants to train.  There is a shortage of EXPERIENCED pilots.  There always has been.  The problem is getting from no experience to experienced when nobody wants to train.  And a shady flightschool abusing a loophole isn't going to fix that.  EMS jobs want 1500+ PIC hours.  Even if you sucked in flight school and took 500 hours in an Astar to get your license, you are still well over 1000 PIC hours short, have no XC time, no mountain time, very little PIC time, no real world time.  The industry really needs to work on a bridge between 200 hour pilots and gainful employment."
Helicopters,31wiod,Azhigher,0,Thu Apr 9 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"The industry doesn't need to do anything. There are plenty of CFI resumes flooding into the entry level turbine operators.

The experienced guys have no problems finding jobs, its only the people with no experience that have problems finding jobs."", which is exactly what I said.  Its near impossible for 200 hour guys to get their break.  For every CFI that makes it, it takes 5 students for that CFI to get the hours.  Each of those students needs 5 students.  Each of those students need 5 students.  200 hour jobs are a pyramid scheme and its a crying shame if you don't see that."

An Australian company run by Filipinos in Micronesia leaves a lot of open doors for things to go wrong, especially on the pilot side of things. Whereas an American company based in America run by Americans (say...Guam for instance) has a lot more legal incentive to take care of its aircraft and its people.

Helicopters,31hkcx,wordtalents,2,Sun Apr 5 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"Unless you're a Canadian citizen, it's going to be impossible to try and get into the Canadian industry as a newly licensed pilot.  We have very few opportunities for low hour pilots up here and there are plenty of Canadian 100 hour guys that are looking for work and the majority of them will never even get started in this industry. You would need to be an experienced pilot (1500+ hours) to be considered for work up here.  I'll probably get down voted for this, but training in Canada is vastly superior to training in the US.  Low hour pilots in the States build their hours as instructors.  In Canada, it is industry veterans with thousands of hours of experience (for the most part) that are instructors.  So the training you receive up here is not even comparable."

Helicopters,31hkcx,whytep,3,Sun Apr 5 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"As a US citizen you're probably better off training down there at a school that would hire you as an instructor to build experience.

Your flight school after you graduate (hopefully around 200 hours) they might or might not hire you as an instructor. If they don't and can't find another instructing job other low job's may include tours. You'll be doing that for a while, then maybe working for a utility company doing off shore oil or pipeline patrol. You'll be going through quite a bit of jobs before you land the one you want, such as the fire fighting, ems, heli-skiing. Right now, look for schools in the US. Mountain training and high altitude training are more desirable when getting a job. And cost of flying will be $85k+"

Unless you plan on staying in Canada long term and getting permanent residency, you won't have any luck.  There are just too many licensed Canadian pilots that are trying to break in to the industry and there is no need to hire someone on a temporary visa for the same position.  There is a lot of anger towards Canada's temporary foreign worker program over the last several years and there are a lot of companies in our industry that take advantage of it.    The instruction in Canada is second to none, most instructors at the schools here are industry veterans and have thousands of hours of experience.

Helicopters,317xjo,FlyingRed,3,Thu Apr 2 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"I was born in Europe and have previously considered to eventually move back there, so I looked into it and spoke to flying schools. This was a while ago so the numbers may not be perfectly accurate but you'll get the idea:  There are some 14 written exams (hard ones, not like the FAA exams) that you have to pass. Actually it's 9 exams for the bare bones CPL, and another 7 for IR, at which point you might as well do the ATPL theory (14 exams) which includes the IR, especially if you want anything to do with off shore or EMS. Not much of a utility market over there anyhow.  You have to complete a mandatory amount of ground school classroom time with an approved flying school. How much you have to do depends on your current experience and qualifications, basically the flight school has to make an individual plan for you and get it approved by the aviation authorities. In my case (I had a bit over 2,500hrs in helicopters when I enquired), they told me it would be around 160hrs in the classroom. This amount is reduced from something like 600hrs that you'd have to do there to start from scratch.  Alternatively there are some distant learning courses offered by various organizations, they also cost thousands of dollars but you only have to show up in person every once in a while. Downside is that this will take a lot longer to complete.  The same thing applies for the flight training. Yes they were planning to flight train a 2,500hr+ pilot with 2 commercial licenses, IR, a grade1 instructor rating, chief pilot credentials etc for 10 or 20hrs of dual to pass a commercial exam.  In case you are wondering, I have no fucking clue what I was supposed to learn during all that time. Although I hear that at least the ATPL Helicopter exams and training includes highly useful stuff like planning a transatlantic flight in a A320 and learning about different cabin pressurization systems..  Overall I was told to expect at minimum 6 months full time for the process, and around 15,000+ euros direct costs depending on which aircraft endorsements I wanted to carry over.  The whole conversion process is, and there really isn't a more polite way to say it, completely FUCKED. The one and only reason that it is this difficult is to protect the domestic flight training market and stop people from training overseas. Jokes on them, I'm staying in Canada."

The best paid jobs are in the offshore North Sea sector for the larger companies, they do hire low hour pilots. Age isn't a factor really, especially being that it's illegal to discriminate against age when hiring a pilot. And at your age you don't have to worry.

I'd like to remind everyone that the people who came up with this mod aren't just a bunch of armchair engineers. Despite all the QC problems that Robinson keeps having with their blades, they DO have competent engineers and this modification isn't just something that someone dreamt up on their lunch break. They wouldn't have put this out to modify several thousand R44s world wide if they weren't pretty damn certain that it won't cause any issues.  Also, the R44 isn't the only helicopter out there where filing a blade is an acceptable maintenance procedure. There are lots of things done to the machines we fly daily that would sound horrifying to the uninitiated. If it's in the maintenance manual and there is an approved procedure for it, that means people a lot smarter than me have signed their name on it, and therefore it's good to go."
Helicopters,30w1a4,achwas,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. Plus the fact that the cause of the cracks is still yet to be determined.

Helicopters,30u2s2,boilerdam,24,Mon Mar 30 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"By ""elevator"" I am assuming you mean what we in the Army call the Stabilator- not sure why exactly. I believe it is very effective in it's intended purpose which is- ""SCALP"" (that's how us army guys remember things) S- Streamline with main rotor downwash at low airspeeds (below 30 KIAS) C- Collective coupling to minimize pitch attitude excursions due to collective inputs A- Angle of incidence- programs up as airspeed increases to enhance static and longitudinal stability. L- Lateral Sideslip to Pitch Coupling- to reduce susceptibility to gusts. Also compensates for downwash on the stabilator and tail rotor efficiency. P- provide Pitch rate feedback to improve longitudinal stability and to reduce susceptibility to wind gusts. That's right Army instructor pilots!! From memory- Bring on the no-notice check ride!"

Helicopters,30u2s2,BosoxH60,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:50:32 2015 UTC,How many functions does the stabilator have?
Helicopters,30u2s2,Mikofthewat,-1,Mon Mar 30 21:36:58 2015 UTC,"5 functions, 4 inputs"
Helicopters,30u2s2,retreatingbladestall,11,Tue Mar 31 02:52:45 2015 UTC,It's not technically an elevator.  Its a Stabilator.  It automatically slews based on airspeed in order to maintain optimal nose attitude (for sight picture) in a hover as well as a level nose in forward flight.  It is effective enough that it caused a significant enough pitch down and killed several crews in the early models by accidentally slewing down in forward flight.
Helicopters,30u2s2,Mikofthewat,6,Mon Mar 30 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"Of all the EP's I've seen in the sim, thats the one that scares me the most.  The fact that one of its failure modes is to motor all the way down without any warning seems crazy. A common navy flight profile is flying around at 150 ft at 120 KIAS.  You really don't get much reaction time if it fails that way in that situation."
Helicopters,30u2s2,BosoxH60,3,Mon Mar 30 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Do you practice that one in real life?  I've never felt like I didn't have time to react when it's failed on the upwind shortly after taking off (heavy acceleration).  I think the only thing you'd really have to worry about is the pitot tubes both clogging (at the same time, too, I think...otherwise you'll get a miscompare/failure and associated audio), in IMC (I see the biggest threat being ice, and the nose-low with no outside reference).  I think the stabilator gets a bad rap. It's got so much built into it, I honestly don't think there's another failure (total loss of airspeed) that can occur that would cause a real issue."
Helicopters,30u2s2,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"We do, but we tend to fail the stab in the ""up"" position because of the airspeed limits.  The approach is a bit nose high, but it comes down normally once you're below translational."
Helicopters,30u2s2,BosoxH60,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"We practice it failing in a fixed position, but never someone just slewing it full trailing edge down while you flying.  When it was given to me in the sim, however the sim models it, it moved full down very quickly and there was very little time to get it slewing back up."
Helicopters,30u2s2,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:00:56 2015 UTC,Holy cow! 120 at 150'. Must be thrilling!
Helicopters,30u2s2,BosoxH60,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"It's pretty benign.  I've had it a few times, including once 50ft over the deck on NVDs.  As long as you remember not to lower the collective while you're controlling pitch with the cyclic you should be fine."
Helicopters,30u2s2,c5load,3,Mon Mar 30 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, it's a stabilator.  Combination Elevator, Stabilizer. I could only speculate on the reasoning behind that, so I won't bother.  Yes, it's very effective.  Look at the size of it.  It's almost a Cessna wing.  When it fails out of the Auto mode at cruise, you really only notice the difference during landing with a bit higher nose-attitude. If it fails during acceleration, you stop accelerating, unless you can manually slew it with the ""cyclic mounted stabilator slew-up switch"".  As far as the crashes in the Blackhawk's early life, only see Armyaircrews.com listing a single incident where the stabilator is to blame. (Though it only lists crashes where someone was killed, I think.) Which happens to be the very first Blackhawk ever lost, in 1978.  That incident is reported as being caused by the stabilator amplifier losing all airspeed info.  This makes the amplifier think you're at 0 KIAS, and slew full down to streamline with M/R downwash (as previously mentioned in another post). I've never actually looked into how many REALLY happened before, and I wonder if the other early-life crashes that occurred (and actually caused by other issues) were just falsely attributed to the stabilator.  If that's the case, this ""institutional 'knowledge'"" that the stabilator is a deadly killer is going to take some time to get rid of, if ever.  Source"
Helicopters,30u2s2,swissarmypants,2,Mon Mar 30 21:35:08 2015 UTC,The army's versions have a stabilator slew switch on the cyclic?  The Navy variants have it on a panel on the lower center console.  It requires the PNAC to reach over and slew it.
Helicopters,30u2s2,BosoxH60,2,Mon Mar 30 23:04:16 2015 UTC,Slew up only. The man Slew switch on the console does both. It's pinky switch/trigger.

Helicopters,30u2s2,KTBFFHCFC,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"True... I never noticed its relative size. Is the slewing manually or automatically controlled during the different modes of flight? As in, does the system automatically recognize the amount of slew needed for level forward flight or does it need to be manually trimmed out? And likewise for landing/tac approaches? It seems like the cyclic mounted slew switch is used only when the auto-mode fails and the stabilator goes limp."
Helicopters,30u2s2,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"Slewing is automatic during normal modes of flight. ?(army wise) Manual operation of the stabilator in flight is prohibited, with the exception of formal training (IP required), or maintenance flight requirements, or alternate control in the event of AUTO mode malfunctions.  Basically, in the regular army, you can't slew just because, though the 160th has a task in their training manual allowing it... It keeps the tail down during rolling takeoffs. Important when you've got a fuel probe sticking off the front. Which someone else mentioned as something that is done by apaches.   Most of the slewing occurs based on airspeed with minor adjustments based on pitching moments, collective inputs, or being out of trim.  An inflight demo (with an IP) with the stab out of auto mode will really show how much it does for you. Especially with pedal inputs putting it out of trim. (Increased downwash on the stabilator when in a...right? Sideslip.  Again, because it's so large, and such an arm being at the end of the tail, it will pitch the nose a bit.). Same goes for collective inputs. (Collective up, nose up, etc. )  Tl;dr: it's all automatic. No trimming done, or required. In fact, once you make any manual adjustments, it's out of the auto mode until you 'press to reset' to auto mode."

Helicopters,30vdr0,retreatingbladestall,5,Tue Mar 31 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, how many people on this subreddit do you think personally purchase 1-2 million dollar helicopters?   No idea. That is why I asked.   And then, of that number, have already ordered a helicopter that isn't even certified yet?   Again, no idea, that is why I asked. But Bell alleges they have 300 orders and there are 6,801 subscribers to this subreddit. I was trying to figure out if those two groups had any intersection. I would even take some rumor passed along by the lunch-lady at the Bell cafeteria based on an overhead conversation in front of the dessert display.   I don't know if I've seen a single post that suggested anyone on this subreddit personally owns a helicopter other than a Robinson.   I wasn't just asking about people owning personal helicopters (though I guess there could be). I figure there are pilots / people who work in flight departments here whose companies might have placed an order. Heck even if someone owns a R44 ($450k or so new?), I don't think it is a stretch if they were looking to upgrade a Bell 505 ($1.07 million or so new) would be on their radar.   I could certainly be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure you are asking in the wrong place.   Actually, judging by the lack of response, you are probably right, but I thought I would check. I'll move along now."

They were brokers and they purchased positions on the helicopters delivery dates.   Then they would advertise them for sale. If they didn't sell them then they had to purchase the helicopter or forfeit the down payment.  If your interested in buying a helicopter. Call Bell and get in line with a deposit.

Helicopters,30sbz0,zukalop,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:04:42 2015 UTC,Yes it's a search radar. I've always been curious why manufacturers choose to mount these radars on the bottom of naval helicopters with very low clearances to the flight decks. Landings at sea can be quite rough.
Helicopters,30sbz0,Rotorwash7,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:45:35 2015 UTC,landings at sea still occur with landing gear.  The radar also needs a clear search path 360 degrees around it.  Where else could it go?

Helicopters,30icgk,TradocTanker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"The 85/15 rule wasn't enforced for whatever reason.  And I personally think that it should be more like 60/40 or 70/30.  Nobody is arguing that these schools are purposely ripping off the government.  But that is what happens every single time the government starts throwing money around.  Same for health care, and if you think tuition is expensive now, wait until the government starts paying for EVERYONE to go to college.  The GI bill was not intended to be FAFSA.  It was intended to cover  a large portion of education expenses, and also includes the provisions for VA home loans.  Our government is great at wasting money.  I don't agree with it at all.  But in my book, there are much greater things to worry about than the government wasting money on veteran's education benefits."

Helicopters,30icgk,JfSanecrab,2,Fri Mar 27 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"That depends.  What the VA has done in the past when schools fail to meet the 85/15 rule is as follows:  give them until the next semester to comply.  If they cannot or will not comply, they pull all funding for all existing and future students.  In other words,  unless Guidance can comply by the Fall 2015 semester, all VA funding will be pulled and there will be no Fall 2015 semester.  That's what they have done to other schools in the past.  That's the precedent.  I don't see Guidance being able to recruit nearly enough students in the next semester.  I'd pack your bags and find a new flight school that CAN and DOES comply with the regulations, and I'd personally do it BEFORE the school gets shut down and you are competing with 300 other students for 20 flight spots..."
Helicopters,30icgk,Tailgunner90,2,Fri Mar 27 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"Another thing I thought was funny:  You can spend 250K and go fly with UHI @ Embry Riddle and receive a 4 year Bachelor Degree from a prestigious flight school.

To any students currently enrolled, I would highly recommend you contact Riddle and get enrolled before all of the slots are taken up by students dropped at Guidance Aviation."

Helicopters,30icgk,Machismo0311,2,Sat Mar 28 04:44:54 2015 UTC,There really aren't that many helicopter jobs out there.

Helicopters,30aaj8,Machismo0311,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:03:27 2015 UTC,Saddle tanks make it hard to see where it's going on the power lines. And I've learned dead trees cost more than live ones. You kill one tree off right of way then all the sudden that tree was where someone's great great great grandpa kissed their grandma. Which they then want $500 million dollars for their anguish.   The boom on the front lets us see fairly easily where the product is going.   I'm really not partial to any one thing. Whatever gets the job done.
Helicopters,30aaj8,littlebluetruck,3,Thu Mar 26 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"Story time:   I was spraying pasture in Virginia for a cattle rancher.  I got a call from a highly annoyed and somewhat angry rancher saying the sheriff was looking for me and him about one of the neighbors who claims I flew over her property and ""completely soaked her husband"" who was outside gardening.  I also killed their entire garden somehow only hours after spraying it with herbicide.  Well this batshit crazy old lady had no idea that we have computers these days and I loaded all my flight path and spray information into google earth and gave that to the area manager to take to the sheriff and the lady who was accusing us of killing everything she ever cared about.  The closest I flew to her property was about a mile away.  She was also upwind.  Apparently she didn't have much to say after being confronted with the evidence."
Helicopters,30aaj8,littlebluetruck,2,Thu Mar 26 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"My turn.   Spraying a line and noticed a bunch of kids watching me from a hill. Once the spray turned on their dad ushered them into the house. Now mind you I was a good 800 yards away.   Well, I take a few more loads and when I get back I see a guy with a ponytail flip a cigarette into my tanker drivers face. Well, I threw my straps off, helmet into the passenger seat rolled to idle, and went to see what his problem was. He drove off as soon as I got out.   I get a call from my area manager and he said the guy claims I sprayed his catfish pond and killed his fish. Pulled the Guia files showed him he's s lier. He then claimed the herbicide ran into his pond. The same one that was 800 yards up hill.   He called thee EPA power company came in to see what the deal was. He said he needs $10,000 for damages.   It ended with him getting told to get  fucked see you in court. Never heard from him again.   People always want a hand out."

Helicopters,30aaj8,Av619,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:07:30 2015 UTC,"Canada. I spent 4 summers gooping trees. That's what we called the herbicide used in forestry. I spent two summers spraying row crops, which I enjoyed a lot more than forestry, although the chemicals were worse.  Then I painted green houses for a while using an isolair on a jet ranger. That was by far the most fun, the best work hours and best after hours locations of any spraying job. Also the most dangerous.  I loved every hour of spraying and got out before anything untoward happened to me. Flying EMS now on a medium twin."

Helicopters,30aaj8,Swashplates,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"You do not need a CFI or an ATP to get an ag job.    Edit:  You only need a CFI to get a flight instruction job, and you only need an ATP in a handful of instances in helicopter world."
Helicopters,30aaj8,RCjohn-1,2,Wed Mar 25 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"Yes technically that is true, but to get an AG job you usually need to have a bit more hours than 200 out of flight school."

Helicopters,30br6y,Autorotator,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:57:05 2015 UTC,The reduced drag may be an advantage to achieve higher top speed. Coaxial rotors aren't affected by dissymmetry of lift which would be the main factor in VNE of a conventional rotor system.
Helicopters,30br6y,Rotorwash7,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"They are affected by disymmetry of lift.  Each one on one side.  They are also affected by RBS, to an extreme end where the retreating blade actually pushes in the wrong direction.  Again, one stalls on one side and the other stalls on the other.  The weight required for the structures and hydraulics of a retractable system is far better used for more armament, more range, or more armor."
Helicopters,30apmn,Av619,3,Wed Mar 25 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"If you have a genuine interest in flying ag, skip flight instruction all together.  Many ag/utility companies will hire guys fresh out of school.  Usually you will spend about 2 years driving a truck and working a ground crew with very little, if any, flying.  Then if you've proven you know how to work they'll start throwing you stick time and if you have decent ""stick and rudder"" skills they'll give you a seat.  Its more of a gamble because you give up flying for a while and risk setting yourself back a year or two if you don't get a seat or simply do not like the type of work.  On the flip side, you'll jump way out in front of your peers in terms of real world experience and pay."
Helicopters,30apmn,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:54:19 2015 UTC,Interesting! How much do ground ops typically pay? Once I have a loan it is very important that I can make my payments regardless of what job I have! Also what are the chances of getting a pilot position without doing the ground side of things?
Helicopters,30apmn,Cropgun,2,Wed Mar 25 22:50:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've never asked the ground guys who are pilots what they make.  Its probably more than a regular ground guy, but not much.  It also probably varies widely by company.  One of the companies I work for pays $25/hr, and another company has everyone on salary making probably about 2k a month if I had to guess plus $40 a day per diem.  A flight instructor doesn't do better than that usually from what I read.  As a low time guy with no ag/utility experience jumping into a seat without working a ground crew is a wet dream."
Helicopters,30apmn,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:10:15 2015 UTC,HAHAHA a wet dream! love it! well thanks for the info and keep the pictures coming!
Helicopters,30apmn,Machismo0311,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:35:19 2015 UTC,No problem.
Helicopters,30apmn,Machismo0311,2,Wed Mar 25 23:38:56 2015 UTC,We pay our fuel truck drivers $15 an hour with guaranteed 40 hours a week whether you work or not. We typically get 60 hours for the ground personnel. They get $1 bonus per acre we spray as well.   I never did the CFI gig either
Helicopters,30apmn,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:44:48 2015 UTC,That is a huge bonus! That makes way more than $13 an hour that I make at my current job! If I can get a job earlier than getting my CFI I am going to! Although out of school with private instrument and commercial Id only have like 150-170 hours! How does that work? Are you once again a guy that got in due to family connections?
Helicopters,30apmn,Machismo0311,3,Thu Mar 26 06:02:43 2015 UTC,"I found a guy who let me fly tours in a 44 for a few years. But when I started school I heard of the company I worked for and went and talked with the owner. Wrote him a thank you card after we met as well. I took one of his cards and on the back I wrote some of the non work things we talked about.  For instance, his wife was getting knee surgery, so when I went to see him again I asked about his wife.   I would send him emails every month just letting him know I was still around. I also would ask him about what he did on his off time. Found out we had a lot of the same interest. So when we met, we would talk about our interest instead of work.   After a few years he asked if I would want to work a ground crew for a year to see how things worked. I said I'd love to.   While on the ground crew I was allowed to ferry the aircraft and when the next year came around they started me doing patrols. Then spray season came around they strapped a boom on the ship and now here we are I guess."

Helicopters,30apmn,Cropgun,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:22:41 2015 UTC,"Brother, all you need IIRC is 200 hours in helicopters, 50 of which are in the R-22, to operate as PIC. To switch to the 44, you only need 25 more hours in the 44. A smart decision: get 175 hours in the 22, then finish your training in the 44. You should wind up with 200 hrs total from private through CFII, and then you're marketable in both ships."

Helicopters,304hqc,papamaman,10,Tue Mar 24 12:25:03 2015 UTC,I bet it gives Robinson a run for its money.   Why?   Price Safety associated with the enclosed Fenestron tail rotor. Composite material and its ability to absorb impacts and general fatigue. Fully articulated tri-rotor and its inherent stability . Service Ceiling The new/cool factor.   Color me impressed.
Helicopters,304hqc,caross,3,Tue Mar 24 14:28:56 2015 UTC,I really hope it does give Robinson a serious challenge. Especially if they are successful and start work on a 4 seater. Force Robinson to make blade redesigns and explore new engine technologies that are on the horizon.
Helicopters,304hqc,iamkokonutz,6,Tue Mar 24 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Truth is, Robinson operates pretty much by itself in the market.  Competition would be good."

Helicopters,304hqc,maisouai,6,Tue Mar 24 12:26:49 2015 UTC,"French here and I worked with ""Helicoptère Guimbal"" on Main Gear Box Bearings for 15 months (they have only one supplier for this kind of matter).   This helicopter is a very good helicopter build by the engineerring team created and managed by Bruno GUIMBAL. This engineer was before the head of the hydraulic & flight control systems office design at Eurocopter (Airbus Helicopters now).  At that time, when he left the company to start its own, Eurocopter helped him and allowed him to use some specific design as the fenestron or the starflex design rotor. This helicopter is very good, reliable and have really impressive handling qualities. Is now very famous as school rotorcraft.  You all have right because Mr. GUIMBAL next project is to design and build a bigger version of this machine: A 4 pax helicopter called Cabri G4.  I have visited the FAL if you are interested in any detail. Also, I know guys who have worked there for internship."
Helicopters,304hqc,n1c0sax0,3,Tue Mar 24 20:07:34 2015 UTC,It looks like a very well crafted and safe machine and It's awesome that you got a chance to work on it!

Helicopters,304hqc,lorryguy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think you should chose something in general mechanics. The thing is : it's not compulsory to get into an aeronautic school to reach your goal but you will have more chance to enter in an aeronautic industry if you do. In fact, people coming from aeronautic schools sees their chances increase because of the reputation.  But it is always possible to do by taking another path.   Here, in France for example, when you are coming from SUPAERO or ENSICA (ISAE now) it easier than a guy coming from general engineering school.   The last thing is about the industry. Now, they are using subcontracting contracts a lot. So lots of people working in the aeronautic field are working as subcontractors and they are not belonging to the company.   I'd love to talk more about ""how to become an aerospoce engineer"" :) If you have more precise questions, do not hesitate!  Ps : I don't have a standard education (as other engineer in France I mean). I'm French also and I know French system is really different from what American or English have.

It looks exactly what I would expect an R22 with a European-designed airframe to look like.   Though it's nearly twice as much as the R22, they say overhaul costs will be much less. Does this mean they will have Guimbal-trained mechanics in the US or does it have to be shipped back to France? I'm not sure many companies could afford to not have their helicopter for 6 months during an overhaul if it has to be shipped overseas...  If they ever start production in the US, I'll be the first to submit my application! Would love to have more 2-seat competition in the States."

I have looked at my situation and thought over if i felt ready. i did take responsibility for what i was not ready for and worked on that between sessions. my problem is where the flight school sets aside a certain amount of time and then blows through that time with no thought of others schedule. As for work i do put school highly on my list. All i was was looking for was if there was any stipulations on timing of checkrides and you answered that thank you.

I am 32 and can't waste my time waiting to get into a program like that. I went to redstone college, went on a Friday, that same day I was enrolled and was starting school on Monday! It's an expensive school! But I get the hours in about 16 months.

Eventually something will break while you're doing this, and the helicopter will then try it's very best to murder you for ignoring scheduled maintenance. Maybe you'll get lucky and be able to put it down safely. Maybe the main rotor falls off and you fall straight to a very painful death.   Is it really worth the risk to find out what happens when you run components past their overhaul periods? It's not like you can cautiously pull to the side of the road when your tail boom falls off, or if the engine and transmission part ways from the passenger compartment because of a bracket that needed overhauling was left to fail instead."

Helicopters,2ztf3g,Xizithei,2,Sat Mar 21 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"I have never fired any sort of munitions from a helicopter.  But  I did spend 8 years in the Marine corps, so I know a fair amount about blowing stuff up.  A 30m spread seems like a lot, but you must consider the kill/casualty radius of the weapon.  A handgrenade (m67) has a kill radius of 5 meters and a casualty radius of 15 meters.  Meaning you can reasonably expect anything within 5m of the exploding hand grenade to die and anything within 15m to be filled with shrapnel.  The m67 only has 6.5oz of explosive in it.  The M70 Hydra rockets in this video can be fitted with several different warheads.  The ""smallest"" warhead contains 8.7lbs of explosive.  I cannot find any information about the kill or casualty radius of an m70 rocket.  If 6.7oz of explosive has a casualty radius of 15m it is not unreasonable to expect 8.7lbs to be greater.  So if two hand grenades are detonated 30 meters apart, everything  between them has a high expectancy of being at least wounded, you can certainly expect two rockets hitting 30m apart to be effective.  Firing a salvo of 2 rockets also preserves ammunition.  Many times a helo provoding CAS will have flown a long way to come help bail out ground forces.  If they were to dump all their ammunition right away, they wouldn't be of much help.  But if they fire small salvos, it allows them to provide suppresive fire for a longer period to allow the troops in contact to either retreat to a better position, or flank, or whatever."
Helicopters,2ztf3g,Poop_is_Food,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I'm vaguely familiar with these weapon systems, I just notice that for some variants having an effective range of 8km, it just seems like a flaw that the round would go so wild. Also, they seem to have an effective kill radius of 10m, with shrapnel ranging in at 50m, depending on the warhead of course.  I of course understand the salvos of two rounds, one per pylon; on that particular system, I just wonder if that wasn't a snafu or what."

Kind of like Boeing and Lockheed can charge X amount of dollars for aircraft that cost them a tenth the price to build. Boeing, Lockheed, and Guidance Aviation or any other government funded company is collecting their revenue from the taxpayers. It's unfortunate they don't create a bill like this for other government funded companies also. We'd save a ton of money as a country. But hey John, good job on the rape!

It's just a CAP on flight training when it's part of a degree at a state school...I believe they said the cap will be 20,000- which is the cap for private school.""

This is because Guidance was aimed at charging the government. Not individuals. So John Stonecipher was a very smart man.

I'm not rich, and especially wasn't when I got out of the military (yes, I too am a veteran). I was on the pre-911 GI Bill (although most of my service was post 911) so I had to get a loan for my flight training. You can do this also.  Use your benefits for a real education at a real school. Go to a state school and get a good degree. Then go to flight training. It's not that hard."
Helicopters,2znjrf,jediforhire,3,Fri Mar 20 12:55:28 2015 UTC,"I'm using my benefits at a state school, for a real, AABI accredited degree. Is that not good enough?   I'm a helicopter guy getting my fixed wing ratings, so I can get a job. Additionally, I was recently selected for fixed wing in the Army. I'm already working with the school to make sure my training will be credited, but not detrimental to my degree program, because I shouldn't have to go through training again if I'm already rated. But I should be able to get things I don't have, like CFI or MEI, so I can be marketable for a job, which is the whole point. (and why they don't pay for private).   A blanket ""no flight training"" is a terrible move."
Helicopters,2znjrf,BosoxH60,3,Fri Mar 20 14:56:09 2015 UTC,"Is this a blanket no flight training? Or just closing the loophole that Guidance and Upper Limit used to charge some students 500k for training that should have been sub 100k?  Veteran or not, you don't need to do all training in a turbine, nor do you need twin engine when you have less than 200 hours.  Also, there is very little actual flying evolved when working on a cfi. Most work can be done in a sim. Again, if the school is racking up 20 hours of flight time for a student on their cfi, the school is just milking the VA program. And this is the reason for the change to the rules."
Helicopters,2znjrf,jediforhire,3,Fri Mar 20 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. I don't know if anyone is sure what they're trying to do, yet.   I don't agree that what those other guys did was right. What I'm saying is that the rest of us should be punished for it. Quite frankly, you don't really need to do any training in a turbine. There are plenty of companies out there that will train you.   As far as my school, the CFI course is a minimum of 25.0 hours, dual. Stage 1 is done in a non complex (172) and stage 2 is done in the Arrow. This isn't milking the VA. It's a part 141 school (the only thing the VA will pay for), and that's the course syllabus for everyone. To be quite honest, from what I've seen, the vast majority of students are non-VA there.   The solution to the problem isn't to ban payment of flight training, but to fix the loophole by requiring those 141 schools to have an approved syllabus by aircraft type, and only pay for approved aircraft/syllabi. Or something like that. The other option of getting flight training outside of a degree program just isn't enough. It's only 10,000/year. Why should I be able to get a degree at 20k/year, but flight training at only 10?"

I paid my dues, both financially and through time in service, and now they're taking away the only thing I ever planned to use it for.  The smart way to handle this is to put a cap on the amount the gov't will pay.  X amount per flight hour or something like that.  Good luck getting our lawmakers to make the smart decision though.

I agree on the abuse angle, on the other hand I think limiting it will be difficult, or at least require some exclusions (probably they would not allow schools to bill the flight portion as tuition at all). I am sure that aviation is not the only degree program that requires very practical, hands-on training, but it is probably the most costly. I think it is unfair that I would end up paying out of pocket if I want to go to a private school for a degree, but another student could spend $500k at a community college, but that is how it is written."

Helicopters,2z9qui,dog_in_the_vent,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:46:58 2015 UTC,"So the question is of all the students that do graduate, how many of them are finding employment? Are those making it to the 1000 hr and 2000 hr point are there jobs for them? Is the market moving or is there a glut of pilots at all levels with no jobs?  Secondly, if the rules are changed and vets can no longer put their GI bill towards flight training, where do pilots come from then? Meaning are their enough people taking massive loans and working side jobs through school to fill the gap left? Would we end up in a spot where we are out sourcing pilots from countries where it's cheaper to train. Would the market make the push for drones that much faster and hurt everyone new and old?  The article wrote a lot about the sticker shock of some of the training, which is ridiculous for some of them, but what is the ""reasonable"" amount that these schools are inflating?"
Helicopters,2z9qui,no_numbers_in_name,3,Mon Mar 16 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"Not enough of them are finding jobs, the market is being flooded with low hour pilots, there is simply not enough jobs.   With no GI bill Pilots would come from civilians, private payers who have savings and take out loans. I did it, I know many others who have as well. Right now we are the cheapest country to train in, people come here from Asia and Europe for their ratings.   As for the reasonable amount 141 programs are inflating, its not that much more of a rate, its the way the programs are written, we use syllabuses that require more hours for a licences than a part 61 person may use. The highest number we have had for a private through CFII was 120,000$. Compare that to my 45,500$. Its more, but its no half a million. keep in mind that the 141 program has a Turbine transition.  The problem with places like Upper Limit and Guidance is the aircraft they are using for initial training, A Stars and 407s are unnecessary and expensive."
Helicopters,2z9qui,Paperplains,2,Tue Mar 17 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"Based on our conversations with Guidance students and instructors, Guidance is NOT using turbines during private pilot stages. We definitely know Guidance does not have any A Stars nor any flying 407s. Moreover, the turbines they do have (R66s) are not used during private pilot training. We are talking to a number of flight schools and attempting to gain as much knowledge about the industry as possible."
Helicopters,2z9qui,stophr476,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe they aren't using them during initial, but they are over using turbines and abusing the system. I think it's more Upper Limit though."

The good schools who have career placement assistance and relationships with hiring organizations have very good placement rates and we see pilots going into industry.  Your second questions is very good, and, we can tell you what we think will happen. You'll start seeing Chinese students filling these vacancies in the schools. The Chinese NEED pilots and the schools to training them. Congress will choke out domestic training and these schools will then focus on Chinese students. That would be a horrible mistake and unintended consequences of this Bill. The Bill, HR 467, simply has inadequate, unreasonable caps. We agree that some measures need to be placed on things like turbine training - maybe get rid of turbine training all together unless the student wants to pay out of pocket, but don't throw the whole program out buy placing inadequate caps (approx $20,000 per year?) which will choke the industry.  Finally, yes, the LA Times article focuses on sticker shock and sensationalism. Again, no doubt the flight school with the very high turbine costs is bad. But what the articles the LA Times is writing completely overlooks ALL the successes of the good programs and how so many Veterans are getting jobs, benefiting and contributing back to the economy."

I'm presently a military trained helicopter pilot, but my experience level is just shy of a ""real"" job, but I'm in no way able to teach in a Robinson. (It would cost me upwards of 20K to meet SFAR requirements.)  I guess I could go out to guidance or ULA and get a job flying a turbine for them....  Anyway, I'm presently getting add ons for fixed wing using benefits, and my school isn't gaming anyone. Everyone goes through the same program. The only difference being you can take your commercial training in ASEL or AMEL, your choice.  I'm also getting a transition this summer through the military, so won't likely see much further flight training through the school, but still need to complete my degree if I want to be eligible for a gateway program. (Must graduate from AABI accredited school, etc.)  The reality is, VA needs to pay appropriately if you're not in a degree program, and pay a ""standard"" amount through a degree. Right now they only offer 10K/year outside of a degree. But as this article shows, they just don't care, as long as you're ""getting a degree""."
Helicopters,2z9qui,BosoxH60,2,Wed Mar 25 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"Some people stop going to school after training because the degree is worthless. Another problem is that a lot of veterans don't have any skin in the game.  If they use 45,000 in benefits and decide to just fail out they don't have to repay any of that money and they can just go do something else instead... a guy who took out loans or saved up 45,000 would probably not make the same decision... Vets don't look at it as THEIR money.  It's someone elses money.  And to be honest, When I was instructing, some of my veteran students were absolutely worthless... it's like they thought they were BUYING the license and we were just going to give it to them.  Lots of my veteran students worked hard and studdied but ALL of my civilian students worked hard and studied because they were much more invested."

Helicopters,2z9qui,SouthwestFlyer,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really see this as exploiting or abusing. The flight school I currently work at is trying to get approved for Part 141 GI Bill. We have hundreds of guys calling asking when they can use their GI Bill. I don't see this much as abuse as a flight school if almost 50% of our potential new students could be vets.   Some people want to go to college and learn the requirements to get a degree to use and some just want to learn a trade (like flying), especially coming from the military. These guys tell me they see helicopters all the time and wish they had gone Aviation or tried and didn't get it. So, what's wrong with wanting to fly commercially after your military service and using GI to get it? The taxpayers owe it to these guys to pay for their schooling for keeping us safe so we can do whatever jobs we want here in the comfort of the U.S. There shouldn't be a limit on what they want to do or where they can go to school.   I understand overcharging for training because the government is footing the bill is horrible and we don't condone that. But, what most people don't realize is the government itself (FAA) makes the requirements for the guys coming through part 141 more difficult than civilian, leading to more training. It's not always the schools taking advantage. It seems that the government for whatever reason is taking advantage as well, forcing them to spend more than a civilian because they have to meet a higher criteria.   We aren't going to charge any different price per hour for anyone... But they may end up spending more because the FAA thinks they need more training to satisfy part 141..."
Helicopters,2z9qui,cowboy615,5,Fri Mar 20 16:44:00 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with wanting to use your benefits to go through flight school. The problem comes in when a school designs a bogus curriculum to try and milk the government for as much money as they can.  As for the part 141 training many civilians go through part 141 schools/programs too. The 141 requirements are a bit different than part 61 but it's also much more structured. Going through an entire course of flight training under part 141 isn't going to cost that much more than having the option to do certain pats under part 61. Adding more hours to satisfy part 141 is a drop on the bucket. Doing all your training in a 44/66/206/350/205 is going to sky rocket the price for those hours though.

The ground looks a lot closer than it is when you're trying to look at your spot. This will cause you to flair high and do things to the aircraft your insurance man will be upset about.   Look at the threshold at the other end and your peripheral vision will give you the cues you need. The ground will be there, trust me. Gravity is a constant.    The best advice I can give you is lean on the instructor pretty heavy, it's his job to show you how to do the things you need. Have him show you all kinds of stuff, because when he's not there it's all up to you. Better to have a full bag of tricks then trying to make things up on the fly."
Helicopters,2z7s7x,__KODY__,6,Mon Mar 16 09:16:18 2015 UTC,"Commercial pilot here. Ok so this is just my perspective, and I doubt many (if any) on here will agree, but here goes.  I halfway regret becoming a pilot.  Here's why.   I was lucky enough to be able to go all the way to commercial license without taking out a loan. At first, I adored flying. I remember loving every minute of it. I remember being thrilled with making my private and being hungry for more. But, somewhere between private and commercial, I stopped loving it. I'm not entirely sure why, but I can take some guesses.   I don't like the aviation industry attitude. It seems all pilots have this attitude about them when it comes to flying that's very hard to explain. Kinda cocky, I guess.  I've had some bad experiences with instructors. Like, some that just upset me pretty bad. It really put a bad taste in my mouth.   Stress. Check rides are incredibly stressful, and given that 2 of the 3 I've taken occurred at some of the most stressful times of my life, it just really affected me.  I know there's more than that, but that's all I got right now.   Another reason is that, despite me having my commercial for a couple years now, I'm yet to be paid for a single second of flight time. Nit that that is a surprise, everyone knows that you must go all the way to CFI if you want to make any money. I was unable to do that though, as I moved literally the day after my comm check ride. And let's talk about CFI for a second.   As a CFI, unless you wind up very lucky, you'll be doing good to bring in $300-$400 a week. And you must have a job as a CFI until you reach a minimum of 1,000 hours if you ever want to do anything else. Take that into consideration.   Now take into consideration the amount of money it's going to take to get to CFI. 150 hours in minimum for commercial. If you use an R22, that's $280/hr. Then you'll have to do at least an additional 20 to prepare for the CFI check ride. $280x170. MINIMUM. A good chunk of change.   You will not get to making what you are now annually for years if you go for this. That's just reality.   I do like flying, but it's not a good career move, especially if you have a family. I hope to get back into one day, but I ended up getting another job that I love and make decent money at, that has nothing to do with flying. I feel like I wasted all the money and time and effort I put into this, because I haven't seen a penny of it back. Most here will tell you to go for it, and if you really want it, by all means do. But know what you're getting into."
Helicopters,2z7s7x,J4rrod_,5,Mon Mar 16 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"I feel the same as a you.  When I began flying, it was the best feeling.  I felt that I had finally found something I loved, and could see myself making it a career.  I lost that passion around the same time as you did.  Flying is actually fun again now that I have accepted that I won't be a professional pilot.    I'm currently finishing up my commercial, and should be done next week.  While it all started out great, the school really took all the fun out of flying.  I think the biggest problem at my school is people forget who works for who.  Instructors work for the students, not the other way around.  I won't get into huge details, but we had some instructors lying about there time spent with students to increase their pay.    We do have a few wonderful instructors who will hopefully be rewarded with jobs soon.  However the bad apples, and the high ups ruin it for the school.  They just don't seem to legitimately care about our careers.  One actually stated that its not their job to prepare us for a career.  That's exactly what your job is!  Like you I have accepted a position outside of aviation.  I'm sure I'll continue flying, and maybe get my CFI someday.  I just don't want to rely on aviation to keep myself alive.  My best advice to OP would be to thoroughly research the flight school you are considering.  Get opinions and reviews from students who attended.  Don't believe what the school tells you.  They are a business, and you have money to spend."

It's just too much BS, risk, stress, and drudgery to be a low time helicopter pilot, especially as you get older, or if you aren't loaded, or with kids. I don't think I would do it again if given the choice, for fun sure, but that costs too much in helicopters. It's not like I didn't do my research or nobody told me these things, I just thought I wouldn't be that guy and it wouldn't apply to me. There are a lot of bigger things at work now that are out of your control and working against low timers. If you absolutely have to try being a career pilot, give fixed wing a chance."

If I was hiring a 100hr pilot, I  wouldn't hire about half the people I went to school with.  2) Attitude - self explanatory. Some are doers and problem solvers. Some need to be babysat, told what to do and require maintenance to keep motivated. Do you look for things to complain about, or things to be happy about or fix?  3) Luck - You got it or ya don't.

The OH-58 and UH-60 are vastly different in terms mechanics/systems and capabilities. There is also a lot more aviation (both army regs and faa) knowledge that you are responsible for as an aviator that you are not as a maintainer/NCM.   Edit: another thing I just thought of- as a wrench turner your job stops when you go home at the end of the day (unless you're an NCO and have soldier crap to deal with). As an aviator, it doesn't. When you get off you go home and study. At least that's what you do if you give a damn."

Helicopters,2z13fl,leakyconvair,0,Sat Mar 14 20:07:53 2015 UTC,This is really hard on a helicopter.  That's why 99% of companies don't do it.
Helicopters,2z13fl,CrashSlow,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect. The reason most companies do not trailer helicopters has more to do with the configuration and utilization. Any helicopter with more than two blades is a poor candidate for trailering due to the extra blades sticking out into other lanes. As an example, almost all MD 500 series helicopters are ferried due to the complex 5 blade rotor system. With frequent moves, it becomes too expensive and time consuming to remove the rotor head every time you want to move the helicopter. Apart from that, most helicopter operations run out of fixed bases, or a series of fixed bases. Timber application can have you cover the entire south eastern United States in the course of a few months. Depending upon the work, (private or small grower, which will be under a thousand acres; or company work such as campbell group or Weyerhaeuser which can be tens if not hundreds of thousands of acres in a fairly small geographic area) some timber helicopters won't be trailered. The smaller and more spread out the tracts are, the more economic advantage to trailering."
Helicopters,2z13fl,fivechickens,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"As an example, to remove an astars blades, requires the simple removal of two pins on each blade.

Even the sky-crane blades come off rather easy.   The only ones that its problem on is two bladed bells.   They require the whole head to come off for tracking before reassemble."

I hear they don't like helmets there because it makes the passengers feel unsafe, as they don't have helmets.  Helmets are usually worn in utility type operations, such as long lining, along with bush flying.  In Canada, where I fly, your first job will most likely be in the bush.  Most pilots wear helmets.

Get a cheap set of David Clarks and get the blue ear plugs from Walgreens. Take the 1500$ you saved and buy more flight time which will help you more in the long run.   I would not buy a helmet before I had a job that requires me to. They are expensive and there isn't a guarantee that you'll get a job after you're done training.

Speed is still limited by retreating blade stall.   The coaxial rotor system and the pusher prop both serve to delay the onset of retreating blade stall (RBS), thus enabling higher speeds. Higher speed capability has always been one of the major objectives in any new helicopter design.  As far as the pusher prop specifically, by relieving the main rotor of the job of providing thrust, main rotor angle of attack is reduced at speed, thus enabling higher speeds before the onset of RBS.  This is a link to an article on the subject in Professional Pilot"
Helicopters,2yw64h,SierraHotel058,9,Fri Mar 13 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"by relieving the main rotor of the job of providing thrust, main rotor angle of attack is reduced at speed,    Aah, yeah, that makes so much sense."
Helicopters,2yw64h,evannever,5,Fri Mar 13 17:46:12 2015 UTC,Thank you sir! That's a technical and professional answer that fulfilled all my doubts!
Helicopters,2yw64h,Salomanuel,5,Fri Mar 13 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"yes, retreating blade stall is still a thing, but the true danger in RBS is uncontrollable dissymmetry of lift. If both rotors experience dissymmetry of lift on opposite sides, then the center of lift is still over the shaft.  That being said, RBS will eventually take it down at high enough speeds because of the torque-speed requirements at higher drag."
Helicopters,2yw64h,ClayJay751,1 point,Fri Mar 13 10:49:24 2015 UTC,"What does ""torque speed requirements"" means? For what I know, the faster you go, the less wing(blade) you need to produce the necessary lift. That's why I was talking about small wings. The rotor will take care of the lift till you are fast enough to rely on the small wings."
Helicopters,2yw64h,Salomanuel,3,Fri Mar 13 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"The torque-speed curve of the turboshaft engine; typically there is a linear trade-off between torque and speed. So, with increased drag, more torque is required, but having enough speed to maintain lift is important too. Most modern helicopters have control systems in place that handle engine throttling for these purposes.  Not really sure what you're talking about with the ""small wings"" concept."

The primary source of lift is still the main rotor(s).  EDIT: The function of winglets is simple to hold things on the lateral sides of the aircraft. See AH-64, UH-60 extra fuel tanks, Eurocopter X-3. The reason they look like wings is because that causes the least drag. Even then, their primary function is not lift generation."

The ""why"" part of it.  But the assumption that this ""new"" thing doesn't provide a benefit other than a more level fuselage I think goes directly against what you're saying as far as a non professional finding a better solution. Firstly, the pusher on a rotorcraft is the newer tech (relatively speaking). He's basically asking why we're doing something new, and not staying with the same old. We can get a level fuselage in much less complicated ways. (The variable stabilator in the h-60 for example).  My point was that they've put some thought into this. They're not just throwing pusher props on rotorcraft because it looks sexy.   The ah-56 had the stub wings 50 years ago (and pusher prop, and traditional counter torque rotor, for that matter). It's been tried. If they're not really using them, I trust there's a reason, and they've modeled whether the inclusion would be beneficial."

(disclaimer: I may be wrong and haven't practiced these since flight school over 10 years ago (and no longer flying, btw). If I'm wrong, I welcome the discussion to get the right info out there.)  You need to mix forward airspeed and power to minimize your spin. In my Kiowa, the aircraft would fly without a tail rotor at around 90  kts, but you shouldn't try to grease it on with that much airspeed.  You apply and reduce collective to keep the speed up to where you don't spin, but you'll definitely be crabbed.  you should land to a highly improved cement surface to do a run on landing that will let you slide off lane alignment without catching a skid and flipping. Once you've touched down you can cut the throttle.

Page 3-5 It depends on complete loss or not, but by entering autorotation you remove the engine input to the main rotor, this removes the opposite torque acting on the airframe. The tail rotor is what opposes that torque, so with little to no torque, there is little to no need for the tail rotor. The vertical stabilizer and weathervaning should keep you pointed forward enough to make an autorotational landing.  Additionally, you can probably maintain some control in forward flight at some point when the weathervane/stabilizer forces balance with a certain power setting. This would let you continue flight to a nearby airport or someplace with crash rescue."
Helicopters,2yp08e,DigitexSarah,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"I know the most important force that the tail counteracts is the torque effect from the main rotor, so it makes sense to have forward momentum to help maintain yourself straight. Autorotation situations seem really intense. I don't think there are very many situations that a fixed wing could end up that would be that bad, short of loss of hydraulic pressure or something similar."
Helicopters,2yp08e,lowflier,2,Fri Mar 13 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Helicopters do have horizontal and vertical stabs on their tail, its not just a tail rotor back there. As a result, forward speed helps you maintain directional control.  Autorotations seem intense at first. Once you practice them they lose a lot of that and become just an emergency procedure. T/R failure forces you to enter autorotation, but not because the engine died. I'd think its similar to an engine failure + stuck rudder in a plane, but I've never flown one so I can't be sure."

Helicopters,2yrkgv,168gr2650fps,2,Thu Mar 12 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"First, you must always be thinking about where the winds are coming from and with that understand how windward / leeward winds will affect your aircraft.  That said, you must always have an exit strategy when working in mountainous areas, always try to crest a ridge line at a 45 degree angle so you have good visibility for your oh shit maneuver.    Also, if you have an aircraft that will compute your performance it is very interesting how much your VNE changes as you climb higher.  You may be use to cruising everywhere at 100 KIAS but if you try to do that higher in altitude you may be exceeding some limits of your airframe.  Last, and it may just be me, but I feel like I'm flying instruments when I get 2k AGL and higher, you just don't have all the nice visual references you had for flying at 500ft and therefore I am constantly doing my cross-check.  Control wise, No, never felt anything different in the controls as long as you descend properly and again not exceed your aircraft's or your abilities."
Helicopters,2yrkgv,BestDamnPilot,1 point,Thu Mar 12 11:18:30 2015 UTC,you will also get a nose bleed at that altitude - what are you doing at 12000'? you will also require supplemental oxygen if flying at that altitude for more than 30 mins Bright side?  you should have lots of room to auto if the engine craps out.
Helicopters,2yrkgv,bh205,4,Thu Mar 12 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"I spent lots of time crossing mountains in Afghanistan in Bell mediums.    Flight controls are little more ""sloppy"" then in thicker air.  You still have full authority, but control inputs take longer to get the same results.  Depending on the gross weight/density altitude, we were often approaching the 5 minute power limitations of the engines.  You also have to ensure that you are not exceeding the VNE (velocity to never exceed), as that generally goes down with higher altitudes.    On top of that, you really do need an escape plan (as stated before).  If you are 10,000 feet above the ground, you have lots of time to get a good landing spot.  If you are at 10,000 feet, but 200 feet about the mountains, you damn well better have a plan, because you aren't going to be making a decent auto to the ground at that altitude.   Mountain winds are another topic altogether, and you really need to take a proper mountain course in order to even start to properly learn about those.  The easiest way to visualize mountain winds is to think of the wind like water.  It flows over, around, up and down mountains just like water in a stream, with the major difference being that you can't directly see it.  If you are flying in the mountains, and you don't know what the winds are doing, you are going to have a bad time."

The one thing i haven't seen mentioned yet is power. Power also diminishes with altitude and/or performance requirements increase and as such, you need to be positive you have the power you'll need for a maneuver. Will you be able to terminate into a hover at the LZ or will you just settle into the spot? Can you hover out of ground effect? Once you're there, can you get back out?"

To prevent things like this, you have a pre flight briefing with the other pilot(s) and establish who is flying where, and that there always needs to be visual contact between the aircraft. So if you lose sight of the other guy, you break off the manoeuvre. Maybe they didn't do this, maybe something unexpected happened that lead to them losing situational awareness. Can't tell yet, will have to wait for the investigation."

Helicopters,2y7oi2,BestDamnPilot,4,Sat Mar 7 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. Those jobs don't need to be advertised as such though. If a company is going to spend time and money on a job posting, they aren't going to put the numbers for the absolute lowest time person they would consider. They'll put whatever their ideal candidate should have: maybe 1,500hrs, type rating on every aircraft they have, long line experience, IFR, etc.   They know that they'll get about a hundred CVs from desperate 200hr guys regardless, and then probably still a ton of people who are somewhat short of their actual requirements. If they can't find the right person that does meet all the requirements, and if their contracts/insurance/customers allow it, they'll pick the next best one and interview them.  To get hired with 1,000hrs, apply with companies that are somewhere where most people wouldn't want to live. Out in the sticks in Alaska for example. Also, don't sit at home writing emails, that doesn't work, especially not with lower-time jobs. The CP likely has about 500 emails from tire-kickers in his inbox, and replying to them generally is a waste of time because most of them aren't serious anyhow.  You gotta show up and shake some hands. Call ahead, tell them you'll be passing through, and if they'd be interested to have a chat."

No way around it for almost all government contracts. Tours and EMS might go lower. When I was CP, I couldn't hire below 2000hrs because our insurance would require us to have that minimum to get a certain rate (yet, it was possible to get a waiver for that, but only if the pilot was a couple of hundred hours off target and highly trained)"

There's too many variables in flight which require human diagnosis and thought process. A plane can autoland but only at a suitable airport and after it had been set up and programmed by a person. So far I have never been to a helipad or helideck which has had an instrument approach associated with it other than weather radar.   What if a plane touches down and a deer runs across the runway? Will a fully automated aircraft make the decision to go around? How would automation effectively land on a moving deck of a boat? Automation may be closer for the fixed wing chaps but unless your talking about helicopter drones piloted by someone in a trailer, it's not going to happen to us for a long time.   Some of the larger helicopters are highly automated, but I don't see a computer making life or death decisions based on warning lights and gauge readings."

Helicopters,2y3l4w,Geo87US,3,Fri Mar 6 10:52:57 2015 UTC,"While the technology is impressive, I still don't think that it will beat human decision making. In the Google car if something goes wrong it can just pull over and stop. If a critical flight instrument fails, how will it know which side is faulty and what to look at? One of the aircraft I have frequently has data display faults, the loss of engine parameters causes the autopilot to try and overspeed the rotor so you have to take manual control for roughly 10-20secs. It would be daft to have a screen failure and the rotors to come off as a result!  I don't think it'll happen in my career. Helicopters are extremely limited by weight, and computers capable of doing that are going to be heavy, and there's going to have to be 2 of them. Just adding EGPWS and TCAS adds nearly 500lbs.

I'm sure it will be able to do it in the future, but like you say, commercial air transport is a more fickle thing than military purposing."

Helicopters,2y3l4w,WDE117,2,Sat Mar 7 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly worried about job security, especially as a helicopter guy. Airlines operate in a fairly structured environment under positive control and I think a pilot will still be required for the foreseeable future. Helicopters, especially commercial or military ones, do a lot of dynamic and unstructured flying. It'll be that much more difficult and costly to program and engineer a machine that can do the mission without a pilot. I'm sure eventually pilots will be replaced with machines, but I honestly don't think it will be for a good while.  What I think you'll see primarily is a significant increase in automated pilot assistance. Computing is getting exponentially more clever and could in the very near future make a second pilot impractical. I wouldn't be surprised to see an increase in single pilot designs right around the corner."
Helicopters,2y3l4w,HelicopterJockey,1 point,Fri Mar 6 10:02:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with automation is that pilots forget how to fly.  Look at the Buffalo NY crash where the very experienced command pilot held the nose up in a stall until they crashed.  When I got my aeroplane license the school manager told me the scariest pilots where the career jumbo jet pilots that wanted to get checked out in a Cessna for weekend flying.  I'm certainly not saying everyone who flies a large jet is an idiot, but I'm saying if you get no practice at the finer skills of your job for years, you are going to get rusty, no matter what field you work in."
Helicopters,2y3l4w,Cropgun,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"""The problem with automation...""  That's the crux though. And it's what tells me that we may actually be at the tipping point NOW where full-scale automation (as in the previous commenter's reference to the SkyTrain) could replace pilots entirely.  The reason I say that is because if current automation is good enough that human error is the problem in a given chain of events then elimination of the human is the solution, no? I mean by virtue of you even mentioning the Buffalo crash (not to mention the recent Air France crash which I think was as similar issue) I see that as a hint that that's the point where we are at.  Flight engineers are already basically extinct because of automation. Two-seat cabins will likely become 1-seats in the next generation of aircraft designs. And from there it's just a business case (and some legislation and/or work on the controlling agencies' parts) to eliminate human pilots alltogether."

Just take a quick look at how the industry is set up and on average what a pilot gets paid.  Operators are too cheap to spring for fully automated aircraft to save on labor.  A fire scout costs 18.2 million bucks.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_MQ-8_Fire_Scout  The technology simply isn't affordable to 99% of operators.  Nobody is going to trade in their 1960 Bell 206 and underpaid pilot for an 18 million dollar drone that they're still going to have to pay somebody to operate.

It's strictly against federal aviation regs to use illegal drugs. And even if your state considers marijuana legal, the federal government does not. The FAA doesn't drug test for licensing, but your employer no doubt will. Also if you get into an accident the government will test you. If you test positive for marijuana they'll probably take your license or suspend you at the least. And good luck finding employment with that in your record.  Cut out the drugs man. Meditate, lift weights, do yoga, eat healthy, follow a strict sleeping schedule, consult your doctor about alternatives, take melatonin, praise the moon gods, see a voodoo witch doctor, whatever. If you are serious about a career in aviation, make the sacrifice. Cut the fuckin weed bro. Going from zero hours to CFII is not an easy path. Once you do that, you'll be going into a saturated job market, hundreds and maybe thousands of CFIs and IIs with 1000 hours looking for a few jobs.

Helicopters,2xzcz4,Paperplains,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:48:52 2015 UTC,I did GI bill flight training also the school I went to in Bend OR was Central Oregon Community College and the flight school was leading edge. The GI bill pays for the college and the college gives you classes called flight labs each lab is a chunk of whatever license you are working on there is no cap with this kinda school at least not that I am aware of because it's not a private university. There is a cap on the amount of classes you can take which is 18 credit hours a quarter but it's pretty hard to get close to that and still sleep at night. Most of the flight labs are 1 credit hour and you can only be enrolled in one flight lab unless you are close to completion and need to open another so your training won't be interrupted. You do have to deal with other students so you can only fly a few times a week which slows you down also but with the classes and ground training this works out fine. Hope that helps.
Helicopters,2xy6w1,ski_bama,4,Wed Mar 4 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"Military (non-flying) then did some special missions to make money. Took the money and a year off and went to be flight student full time. Ran out of money right around my CFI license (an unfortunate car accident didn't help either, ate up the last bit of my funds) Then started as helper in the hangar or Cessna Dealership and worked my way up to A&P mechanic. Trying to find cheap flight time here and there wherever I could fixed and rotor. Had one lucky break where a guy I knew well bought a Jet Ranger which I was maintaining as mechanic and got to fly here and there building turbine time as well in addition to R-22 time. This took about 5 years but the mechanic job paid for living expenses.  Then got hired as mechanic for a flight school and 135 operator with helicopters. At around 500hrsTT and over 100hrs turbine time, two of the Jet Ranger pilots quit and they needed somebody to fly local charter flights. Some of the CFI's had more time than me but I had the 100hrs of Jet Ranger time the insurance required. That led into an early 135 certificate without having a CFI. But the school wanted me to get my CFI so they have somebody who can teach on the Jet Ranger which led to me getting my CFI license. As an instructor who has A&P background and actual experience in the charter world I slowly ended up with a lot of students. I was working 24/7 then building time and making money for my CFII license. Then started teaching Instruments on top of flying the Ranger for back up and working in the shop as A&P. I was working in every department then. Ok money but took toll on family life. Then had the opportunity to transition into AStar and fly on an offshore contract due to CFII qualifications. The AStar time led to a job in utility/fire after roughly 2000hrsTT. That was 15 years ago. Worked in fire and utility during the off-season since flying bigger and bigger helicopter until eventually ending up with the Skycrane. That's the short version ;)  Happy? Yes, I'm pretty happy. Working on government contracts has its downsides but if you used to the military you'll do fine.  Most guys I know that have gone down the same road are at least on wife #2. It is NOT a family friendly job. Lots of moving if you want the good jobs and lots of being on the road. In my world (fire) they are hurting for pilots, especially in the 205 212 types and at the moment these jobs pay the best. Say goodbye to your summers though, I hope you like skiing.  Having also worked as chief pilot for a number of years I can tell you that every time I had equally qualified candidates but one had a CFI, I would always choose the CFI over the other guy and a CFII over a CFI. You can't beat that experience. Oh, and Hillsboro is a pretty good school.  Hope this helps"

That being said, if you really, truly, deep-down-in-your-soul long to be a pilot and are willing to devote not just your time, but money and sanity, as well, it is possible to go the distance.   I'm currently working on my CFI and will hopefully be entering the job market soon and making a little money while building my time. I, like you, was given the opportunity for the military option, but found that I wasn't the military type, either. I'm not looking forward to the little pay and the long hours, especially after the not-quite-100k-but-close investment, but I can't see myself doing anything else. If you want it badly enough, you can do it. I always thought people saying that was very optimistic, but it can be true if you devote everything you have to it.

The guys I've seen that have made it through instructing and on to turbine jobs were the ones that without question, would sacrifice anything for helicopters. I don't say that as a challenge. I mean that for them, family, wives, children, social lives, houses, stable careers, and even fellow pilots were on the chopping block if they got in the way of their progression in aviation. I've seen people uproot their whole family while their kids were still in school to move out to a flight school and help chase Dad's dream. I've seen some basically ditch their family to do the same. I've seen people with not much of family or place they call home that have no problem with moving twice a year, living out of camping trailer or spending all their waking hours at the airport.   These are the guys you are competing with just to get a CFI job. Obviously there are exceptions and some people haven't had to give up much to make it but you have to be ready to do so. If you aren't that's fine, there are actually careers out there where employers will come to you if you have the right skills. Interestingly enough, a fixed wing flight instructor is probably a good example of that right now... but that's a whole other topic and I don't much about it.  As far as the outlook goes, if I were to speculate, it's going to remain very competitive for years. I think a lot of the OIF/OEF Veterans have been keeping the flight training industry alive with GI Bills because most of the lenders really tightened up around 2008. I have no idea what the numbers are but I'd imagine that supply of Vets with GI Bill funding must be decreasing with OIF over and the US involvement in Afghanistan supposedly ending sometime soon. You also have the fact that the Army just got rid of the OH-58 and a lot of pilots along with it. They probably wouldn't compete so much against CFI positions but it might mean you have to endure being a CFI for longer if they get Gulf Of Mexico and 1500-2500 hour jobs.

I also want to mention that you should really think about how bad you want this. (and if you really really really want it like Crashslow put it in the first post). The red flag for me in your posts was not just the depressive disorder but also the connection with your feelings towards the military. Helicopter flying is cut-throat business on top of being dangerous. Not a lot of people will hold your hand and coach you through it and it is not always as romantic as it might look on TV.

Helicopters,2xsv8j,Potatoe_away,2,Wed Mar 4 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"At the EC-145 course they said the ""1"" denotes a civilian helicopter, the second number is the approximate gross mass, and the 0 or 5 is 1 or 2 engines, respectively. -they probably just thought the ""0"" was more marketable and threw the naming convention out the window."
Helicopters,2xsv8j,sheepishsamuel,2,Wed Mar 4 12:19:16 2015 UTC,The new way of differencing Civilian rotorcraft to military one with H or M is a great idea anyway.

As far as what that consists of, an add-on pilot is held to the same PTS as an ab-initio pilot. You will learn Normal takeoffs/landings, hovering, air taxi, quick stops, max-performance takeoffs, steep descents, slope landings, Run-on landings, pinnacle landings, autorotations, hover-autos, settling with power (vortex ring state) recognition and recovery and various other emergency procedures and helicopter-specific knowledge.

Helicopters,2xklcp,tarantulae,3,Sun Mar 1 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"Just a clarification, its a minimum of 19 hours for the transition (according to our local FSDO anyway). You need 40 hours of flight time total, 20 hours dual received, and 10 hours solo, but those don't specify in a helicopter. It goes on to say that your training must include 3 hours cross-country flight training in a helicopter, 3 hours night in a helicopter, and 3 hours in preparation for the practical in a helicopter. Plus the 10 hours solo = 19 minimum helicopter hours, assuming you have enough of the others (which, having an airplane PPL you should).   (c) For a helicopter rating. Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, a person who applies for a private pilot certificate with rotorcraft category and helicopter class rating must log at least 40 hours of flight time that includes at least 20 hours of flight training from an authorized instructor and 10 hours of solo flight training in the areas of operation listed in §61.107(b)(3) of this part, and the training must include at least—  (1) 3 hours of cross-country flight training in a helicopter;  (2) Except as provided in §61.110 of this part, 3 hours of night flight training in a helicopter that includes—  (i) One cross-country flight of over 50 nautical miles total distance; and  (ii) 10 takeoffs and 10 landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport.  (3) 3 hours of flight training with an authorized instructor in a helicopter in preparation for the practical test, which must have been performed within the preceding 2 calendar months from the month of the test; and  (4) 10 hours of solo flight time in a helicopter, consisting of at least—  (i) 3 hours cross-country time;  (ii) One solo cross country flight of 100 nautical miles total distance, with landings at three points, and one segment of the flight being a straight-line distance of more than 25 nautical miles between the takeoff and landing locations; and  (iii) Three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport with an operating control tower."

And because of the way insurance works in the rotary world, renting a helicopter for solo flight with just a PPL requires even more additional expense. Taking a passenger up is out of the question."
Helicopters,2xklcp,hellcheez,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"For sure, a PPL-A is much more practical and sociable..but for the sheer fun (and frustration ;), a helicopter licence is pretty awesome.   But I have to admit, I've taken many more FW XC flights than I've ever done hours in a rotorcraft and I have PPL on both.  Surprised taking passengers up in a rotorcraft costs more due to insurance. I'm guessing this is the US? Any idea how much extra it is, roughly?"
Helicopters,2xklcp,Knight_Doppler,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fly in the U.S. It depends on the company you're renting from.  Some just flat out will not allow passengers to be carried on rental flights. Others require you complete up to 10 hours of dual with a company pilot, and sign on with their company insurance policy (yearly payments). Robinson pilots also have to attend the RHC Safety Course.

Honestly, we spent the vast majority of training on control and maneuvers. Skipped all of navigation. Started training for the checkride at like 16 hours. Spent a lot of time fine tuning the controlability aspect and did a LOT of autos. I think the rotary wing add on is fairly easy for a fixed wing ppl if you can develop the ambidexterity skill involved in fine control movements. Everything else should be ppl review. No written, either. So yeah, theory, a little bit of ground, mostly to cover the helicopter-specific regs and control. That's about it."

So just put it in.  Your chances are higher on that side than the enlisted side (tons of competition on the enlisted side).    Your recruiter is trying to get some numbers and make his life easier.  Some will even tell people that there is no street to seat program.
Helicopters,2xhzj3,barbecukkake,4,Sun Mar 1 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right. My WOCS class of 62 had 20+ street to seat candidates. Every one of them had a story about his recruiter trying to convince him to ""just enlist"" and ""drop a packet later.""  The selection rate for civilians is much higher than the rate for existing service members. This is partially because the application process isn't very accessible for civilians. This means that you, as the motivated applicant, have an advantage. Get all of your ducks in a row, put everything into this application, and you will probably be accepted. If you want to fly for the Army, don't let them convince you to turn wrenches instead.  In my 2011 board, the selection rate for existing service members was about 20%. The civilian selection rate was over 90%. You do the math."

It is undetermined as to the cause, but possible causes are overloading the machine or overflying the VNE.  The second helicopter crashed in NZ, and the blade was found to be cracked clean off in a similar area as the first crack, so all R44's with the -7 blade were grounded in NZ. AUS followed suite. The blade was sent to a lab which determined that the separation of the blade into 2 pieces occurred post crash, and wasn't the cause of the accident.  The grounding was lifted.  Robinson Helicopter released an AD, stating that the blades of all R44 -7 must be inspected before flight.  No FAA action has been taken in anyway, shape or form to my knowledge."

For example, there are numbers on a runway marking magnetic azimuth measured clockwise from magnetic north. How does that translate practically? Especially for a helicopter pilot?"
Helicopters,2x4xk3,tarantulae,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:47:26 2015 UTC,At what point do I see all of these different markings and know where/how to land?
Helicopters,2x4xk3,tarantulae,2,Wed Feb 25 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"I don't actually have the ASA book, so I'm only going off your description (unless you want to upload a picture of what you're talking about). It sounds like you're asking about the runway number.  Runways are numbered based on the magnetic heading the runway points rounded to the nearest 10º. So, an airport that had a single runway running along East/West would have 2 runway numbers. 9 and 27 (for 90º and 270º magnetic heading when you are aligned with the runway).  From a practical standpoint, runways are what airplanes are going to be landing on and flying the airport pattern to. If you are coming to land at the airport from above, and hear an airplane say ""Local Traffic, Cessna 12345 on downwind for runway 27, Local Traffic"" you know approximately where to look to see where he is, and you know that his is going to be landing on runway 27. Commercially, helicopters generally land directly where they are parking, but in the training environment, most schools have their pilots land on runways, and hover taxi on taxiways for safety and to better understand how traffic at an airport works."
Helicopters,2x4xk3,tarantulae,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"ok, so if an airplane communicates that they are planning to land on runway 27 that means that they are appraching from the east?"
Helicopters,2x4xk3,tarantulae,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"If they were appraoching from the west they would land on runway 9L, R, or C, correct?"
Helicopters,2x4xk3,zippyajohn,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"Direction you approach from really has nothing to do with which runway you land on. Generally you land on the runway most into the wind. Often in training you'll land on a runway that has some crosswind instead for the practice. Larger aircraft will sometimes land with a tailwind or which runway is most lined up with their direction they are approaching from, to save time (because they cost a lot of money per 0.1 hobbs), but the wind still has to be within the pilot/aircraft/company policy limitations."
Helicopters,2x4xk3,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Thu Feb 26 04:25:27 2015 UTC,"Airplanes generally land on the runway that is most pointed into the wind. If he was landing on 27, it is likely the wind is either calm or out of the west. He could be approaching from any direction. In the example call, i said ""Downwind"" which is a specific leg of the traffic pattern for a runway. Downwind means he would be flying West to East parallel to runway 9 to setup for his Base and Final legs (each a 90º turn) which would line him up with runway 27 into the wind."
Helicopters,2x4xk3,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I didn't consider the wind. Don't they just land where ATC tells them to regardless of wind direction?"
Helicopters,2x4xk3,Dinnerz58,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:31:13 2015 UTC,"At a towered airport, yes. ATC will have an ""active"" runway which they will put the airplane guys on. It will almost always be the runway most into the wind. They can ask ATC for a different runway if they want and ATC will try to accommodate if they can. ATC works for the pilots, so you can always ask them for something you want to do."

I don't know specifically if anyone is looking for ground crew, but it's the right time of year to be looking.

Sometimes it can turn out well, sometimes it doesn't get you a job, but it will always get your face in front of the people that do the hiring.

Helicopters,2x13se,scr0dumb,7,Tue Feb 24 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"The outer end of the blade is moving significantly faster than the inner end. As a result there is more friction between the blade and the atmosphere, which causes the blade to heat up."
Helicopters,2x13se,achwas,2,Tue Feb 24 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok, that was my first guess, it's a pretty striking difference"
Helicopters,2x13se,scr0dumb,4,Tue Feb 24 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"typically the blade tip speed is somewhere around 0.7-0.8 mach or thereabouts. In forward flight, the forward airspeed is added to that on the advancing side of the rotor (and subtracted on the other side), so on a helicopter travelling at 120kts+ the advancing tip will be fairly close to the speed of sound.   Once you get that close to the speed of sound, air compressibility starts playing a role, which contributes to heating of the blade (the air can't get out of the way fast enough any more, so it is compressed. Compressing a gas creates heat).   I don't know if the heat is more due to friction or more due to compression of the air, but I imagine it must be a combination of both."
Helicopters,2x13se,Canadian47,2,Wed Feb 25 05:06:08 2015 UTC,Between the halfway point along the blade and the outer tip of the blade the speed doubles.   Think about it. The circumference of a circle directly corresponds to the diameter. Double the diameter and the circumference doubles along with it. Since the blade rotates around a common point those distances are being traveled over the same period of time.
Helicopters,2x13se,canadian_boi,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:35:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response! So although there are other factors at play its mostly the result of air friction
Helicopters,2x13se,SeafoodGumbo,3,Tue Feb 24 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"The discussion regarding the velocity being higher at the tip vs. the hub are correct and would explain the gradient. However, while drag/friction play a role, I would guess that the compression of the air (which produces heat) is a larger factor."
Helicopters,2x13se,SeafoodGumbo,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:49:24 2015 UTC,You're right! It has very little to do with friction and significantly more to do with the compression of the air.
Helicopters,2x13se,SeafoodGumbo,3,Wed Feb 25 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"Most of the comments are generally correct.  Friction at the tip is greater than inboard.  It gradually decreases the farther you go inboard.  Also, friction at the tip of the advancing blade is the highest since it has the highest velocity.  On the other hand, if a helicopter blade encounters compressability, friction will drastically increase but,,,,  Most helicopters do not, I say again, do not reach the transonic tip speed in normal flight, even at or near VNE.  If they did, friction would be the least of your worries.  Compressability occurs when the advancing blade reaches that transonic regime (.8-1.0 mach) and blade twisting/structural breakage will occur and that is very bad.  So, to counter other comments, you are not seeing higher temps on the tips due to transonic air flow, period."
Helicopters,2x13se,SeafoodGumbo,2,Sat Feb 28 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Based on what I know about supersonics this sounds most likely, I have never observed transonic/supersonic phenomena in a normal police helicopoter"

Interestingly enough Frank Robinson worked at Hughes before building his own helicopters.   EDIT - and excerpt from the MSB regarding the 500 blades.   ""Some operators have experienced cracking of Model 500/600 helicopter main rotor blades. These cracked blades have been associated with a high number of torque events per hour which exceed the fatigue spectrum.

The explanation given was the situation where this first happened, in an R22, the ship had been used in modest DAs over Max Gross Weight (MGW) and flown past VNE for that DA.  During the factory tour they show you how the blades are constructed and talk about the various tests done to the blades. 1 in 10 is randomly tested for many hours in extreme conditions. Should one fail to meet the estimated 2200 hrs worth of stress test, the whole lot is pulled and inspected. They dovetail those exterior sections together for bonding, so a straight line crack would not only be rare but would suggest metal fatigue. The easiest way to increase the onset of metal fatigue, is by exceeding the operating limitations (VNE/MGW)."
Helicopters,2wv77a,Paperplains,4,Mon Feb 23 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the norm for flying in New Zealand and Australia, they pull the guts out of these little machines and then get freaked out when thy break."
Helicopters,2wv77a,achwas,2,Mon Feb 23 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Or maybe slow down a bit with the generalizations. The machine in the photo may have been an ag aircraft, but it is operated by a reputable company, so blindly accusing them of mishandling it without actually knowing anything about them is not productive. Besides, the blades only had just over 800hrs on them, a third of their rated life span.  The machine that crashed 3 days ago, killing two people and finally leading to the emergency AD in NZ and Australia on the other hand was just a tourism machine, so unless it was operated by complete hacks it is extremely unlikely that it was abused much or at all. Now think about the stress that your average flight training aircraft is subject to in the U.S. or anywhere else and maybe the excuse ""it was probably over stressed"" won't sound quite so reassuring any more. This is serious and I would absolutely not get into any -7 equipped R44 any more until this is resolved."

There are black sheep every where, at the same time some of the worlds most experienced operators of Robinson aircraft are located down there. You don't run a successful operation by running your gear into the ground and killing people. Fact is that the investigators of these latest incidents found what they saw to be bad enough to warrant grounding a whole fleet. Those are people that have forgotten more about helicopters than you or I will ever know, if they make a call like that then there is more to it than ""probably just flew it over VNe""  Also, what you heard at the factory safety course needs to be taken with a grain of salt or two. Robinson isn't exactly an unbiased source when it comes to defending failures of their own products. It's very convenient for them to blame problems on people that aren't in the room"
Helicopters,2wv77a,achemze,2,Mon Feb 23 23:33:32 2015 UTC,".. except i learned about metal fatigue in high school shop class. Witnessed the blades being assembled and saw them in various stages.  Not sure what your objective is in name calling out the safety course information. The NTSB report equivalent (since it occurred in central america) for the accident concurred. I'm not a very subjective person and weeded out all the ""fluff"" in that explanation.  If you really think flying over VNE is no big deal, i'd suggest you look at this again."
Helicopters,2wv77a,achwas,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"You are completely misunderstanding me. I am not denying that exceeding limitations will damage components and cause accidents. I most definitely never said that exceeding VNe is no big deal.   I am however strongly disagreeing with your stance that these machines only crashed because they were being operated in NZ. You think ""it's in NZ therefore it was being operated against the rules therefore no wonder it crashed"". That is wrong. There is no indication whatsoever that these machines were operated contrary to any limitation. The fact that the accidents happened in NZ is not at all cause to disregard them. There are hundreds of machines that you could be unknowingly buying or renting right now in the U.S. that could have been treated just as bad as you imagine the NZ choppers to be. I know because I've seen and flown some of them.  I have worked and flown down there, as well as the U.S. and in Canada. In somewhere over 2,000hrs on type, the worst R44s I've seen were in Canada. By far the best maintained and operated R44 I flew was for a tiny bush operator in outback Australia, exactly the kind that according to common ""knowledge"" would fly around at 28"" all day and write down 0 hours. Robinson uses the old ""Aussies ignore the rules"" stereotype to distract from the fact that their gear has serious design flaws. It's a great way to make Americans feel better about getting in a machine when you convince them first that all failures are caused by mistreatment, and that such mistreatment only happens 8000 miles away in Australia."

Helicopters,2wmi95,MayTheTorqueBeWithU,3,Sat Feb 21 07:07:49 2015 UTC,"RPM is the first reason. That Honda sport bike making 100hp/1ltr is turning at 12000rpm. Since aero engines are designed for direct-drive propellers, the sweet spot is around 2500rpm. Horsepower is torque x rpm, so you'll never make those numbers.   Simpler ignition is the other. Magnetos don't adjust timing as well as electronic ignitions, but they're independent of the electrical system and will spark no matter what's going on with the rest of the vehicle.   Another is the nature of air-cooled engines - they're simpler and lighter, but not as tight as a liquid piston. They're also pushrod 2-valve engines, which don't breathe as well as a overhead cam 4 (or 5) valve heads."

Helicopters,2wljr8,__KODY__,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:55:34 2015 UTC,What state at least?  Sounds a lot like the one down the road from me and I've been looking into flight school as well.
Helicopters,2wljr8,Av8tr1,1 point,Tue Mar 10 09:56:02 2015 UTC,"It was Mauna Loa Helicopters in Hawaii. I don't mind saying it now because they and ATP both want co-signers. I don't have a credit worthy co-signer so, no flight school for me. Funny, because I have really good credit, I guess they just want to see you come from a wealthy family or something."
Helicopters,2wljr8,Av8tr1,2,Tue Mar 10 16:00:42 2015 UTC,First off HOLY SMOKES!!! For the 80K you'll need just for flight training through CFII you'll pay an additional 28K for the price of the loan.  That doesn't include living expenses.  Then you'll have a payment of 650+ a month.    I would seriously rethink this if I were you.
Helicopters,2wljr8,zippyajohn,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"True, I know. I just saw this as an opportunity to get in the air for a career. I know as an instructor that the payment would be a huge hit, but I figured once I got a non CFI job it would be a lot easier to live with. I calculated out more so around $450 a month even with living expenses, due to the fact that they claim around a 2% interest rate as not to completely rape your wallet."
Helicopters,2wljr8,zippyajohn,2,Sat Feb 21 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"Alkallu, I would suggest you stop and take a look at the big picture here.  1st off that is a lot of money to borrow for a market that is highly over saturated with pilots.  I've heard number in the area of 600 applicants for every job posting.    Then if you some how miraculously beat all 599 people for that job you are looking at making roughly $2000 a month for 2 or 3 years.  From that 2000 a month you need to not only pay back your loan but also put food in your mouth, a roof over your head, and all the other things we have to pay for daily to live.    Do the math.  It doesn't work out in Helicopters if you are going to borrow the money.  Find a job that pays a livable wage.  Unless your family owns a helicopter operation the chances are pretty slim you'll get a job as a helicopter pilot.  Not impossible just slim.  If you borrow all that money and can't find a job your right back where you are right now but with 130K in debt.  The military is an option but you might not start out flying.  But if you serve your time you can get out and get the VA to pay your way 100%.    Good luck man.  I've been where you are and I know whats going though your mind."
Helicopters,2wljr8,joshb123,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:02:29 2015 UTC,you might get better advise at r/finance.   If you have a full time job it will take you more time and cost more money for flight training. The more time and effort you devote to training the more success you'll have.
Helicopters,2wljr8,SeaManaenamah,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:45:20 2015 UTC,"This is true, I remember from flying fixed wing before, the longer you take the longer it takes. If not a full time job, what about just something part time? Say in the mornings or at night or something?"
Helicopters,2wljr8,joshb123,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:55:30 2015 UTC,During my cfi (the most busy course) I worked part time from 5-11 at night most nights and it worked out pretty well. I was with my parents though so I didn't have a whole lot of expenses
Helicopters,2wljr8,Av619,1 point,Sat Feb 21 11:29:51 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of money to take out on loans. You'll be putting yourself at a big financial risk for a career that is far from a sure-thing. Like Av8tr1 said, you should seriously rethink how you go about financing your training. Save up the money yourself; more rewarding and less stressful IMO.  Edit: typo"
Helicopters,2wljr8,Av8tr1,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:13:19 2015 UTC,I really don't see how I could save up 70-80k dollars anytime in the next few decades unless I got incredibly lucky.
Helicopters,2wljr8,rotorRat,3,Sat Feb 21 04:56:18 2015 UTC,Then how are you going to pay it off?
Helicopters,2wljr8,FLPSDWN,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Even if you were to save up a good chunk of the money before starting. Financing the entire thing, including living expenses, seems excessive."
Helicopters,2wljr8,Cropgun,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:55:47 2015 UTC,"So I am sort of in the same boat. I was looking to go this route on my own not too long ago I work a full-time job and have a flight School at my work that I really like and have come to know well. (Helistream and they now have the San Diego branch at my work, Jet Air Systems)   When I was thinking about coming into this career I was super excited that all of my research that I knew how to do and spent the first few months really looking into what it was all about.   For the next step I looked into a few different loans and some of which were from Sallie Mae. The one I found was a ridiculous amount of interest more like 7 to 11% interest. For a total of 80k  when paying back would be $730 a month if you paid it back in ten years and $930 a month if you paid it back in 8 years... The total I would have paid back looks like it would have came out to around 130,000 or something astronomical!  Don't quote me on the exact loan or mount I would have to look into it more if I was seriously thinking about going with this option! The next step was to go to my parents and see if I could get them to help me cosign, like you it looks very likely I would need a cosigner although my credit is pretty good.   My parents of course that this idea was pretty far-fetched and my mom thought it was ridiculous!  The next step we came up with was for me to go ahead and save up some money and figure out how to get myself through my private on my own. After that we would see what we can do about a loan  or getting money in other ways.   I have taken a step back from wanting it so bad that I was willing to do anything or pay anything! I have been working my butt off as much as possible and pinching every penny! I am going to save $6000 (I'm very close)! The other $6000 will be going on a zero interest credit card with a zero interest terms of 15 months... The $12,000 will get me very close to completing my private.  While I am going to school I will still be working full-time and saving as much as possible to get the rest of the money.   During the time I have been saving I have talked with my flight instructor to be and have really gone through a lot of studying towards the private pilot written knowledge test! I plan on taking the written test before starting my flight training that way I have more time to do actual ground school and flying!   I really have come to like this idea of doing my private first first off it takes about $12-$14,000 out of my loan and also give me a great opportunity to really see if this career will be for me! The discipline needed to save the money is tough but in the long run has really helped me!   This was all written on my phone, if the spelling or grammar is terrible please excuse the errors  Good luck! Let me know if you have any more questions! 🚁🚁🚁🚁🚁😎😁"

Helicopters,2wh7ks,bigcat318,5,Thu Feb 19 21:57:56 2015 UTC,Of course it's possible.  I got my private while working 60-70 hrs a week.
Helicopters,2wh7ks,Cropgun,2,Thu Feb 19 22:28:37 2015 UTC,How so? Weekends and evenings after work?
Helicopters,2wh7ks,Cropgun,3,Thu Feb 19 23:00:09 2015 UTC,Whenever I could squeeze in an hour.  Took about 6 months.
Helicopters,2wh7ks,Rotatingwings,4,Thu Feb 19 23:27:08 2015 UTC,I went from never touching a helicopter to CFII in 16 months while working 50 hour weeks and taking 3-4 online classes per semester.  If I'd really buckled down and studied harder it wouldn't have taken that long.  It just depends how bad you want it.
Helicopters,2wh7ks,achemze,2,Sat Feb 21 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"I'm doing it. Started off more leisurely as i was just looking to get my PPL and go tool around. Once i got bit by the bug, i started picking up the pace. Should be through to CFI/I in a year, while still working 50-60 hour weeks.  I'm flying on my days off because i work 10 hour days and i'm usually either short on daylight or energy to fly after work. So that limits me to roughly 2 days of 2 2-hour blocks. During the summer months, i'll schedule a 2hr block right after work on my ""friday"" since i have 1.75 hrs of light and that lets me ""dust off"" before the weekends training.  Anything is possible, just don't get discouraged comparing yourself to people doing it full time. I've seen a gaggle of people go from Student Pilot to CFI while i've been on the same road. More time with the material, usually means more familiarity with the material."
Helicopters,2wh7ks,achemze,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I figured it was possible, but didn't know how some people managed to do it after work and before dark. Do most schools schedule blocks pretty late?"
Helicopters,2wh7ks,tarantulae,2,Sun Feb 22 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on the school. Most instructors are ""hungry"" and i've only been flying the 44, so people are willing to stay a little later for some 44 time. :)"
Helicopters,2wh7ks,mickycfly,2,Sun Feb 22 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm doing it now. The long and slow but less borrowed money method. Weekends and nights. Its nice because I have a lot more night time than most of the other students. However, it has taken me much longer overall. Try to fly 2-3 times/week if you can. Where I'm at this means scheduling 4-5 times/week due to some weathering out."
Helicopters,2wghah,sawatzkay,3,Thu Feb 19 18:49:30 2015 UTC,Very little.   Your first job will probably be in the flat lands.  See the tree planting post. You could end up doing that.  Stoned tree planters have no clue and want the cheapest helicopter possible.
Helicopters,2wghah,CrashSlow,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:04:15 2015 UTC,i know that my first jobs are not going to be anything crazy. from what the people ive talked to have said id be surprised to get a flying job within the first few months. i fully expect to sweep floors and fuel the aircraft as my first job.   but all that aside i was looking at jobs online and lots of companies i found said mountain training to be  a valuable asset. so im not sure how important that really is. its like a job that wont hire you without enough experience in a certain field. but you cant get experience because no one will hire you without it.  does that make sense? haha it probably doesnt make any sense
Helicopters,2wghah,CrashSlow,2,Thu Feb 19 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Those job ads are referring to a ""mountain course"".  Specific mountain advanced training.

Helicopters,2wghah,Paperplains,0,Fri Feb 27 15:29:51 2015 UTC,My advice is find a flight school that flies R22s. Unless the flight school is very busy and there's a good chance of getting hired you're only hurting yourself getting trained in a 300 or a 44.
Helicopters,2wghah,zippyajohn,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:54:11 2015 UTC,What is it about the 22 that makes it better than the 300?

Helicopters,2wbhy8,ATechnique,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:40:17 2015 UTC,I am in Ontario (northern) and would love to know more.
Helicopters,2wbhy8,Cropgun,3,Thu Feb 19 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"I planted in Manitoba from 2006 to 2009. Four summers for about 2 months give or take two weeks each year. You can plant all summer if you are willing to move around a bit, and usually that's as easy as just hopping a ride in their vans at the end of a contract.  The company I worked for is called Outland. In general they are a very good company, but like all planting contracts your mileage may vary from one camp to the next. I recommend staying out of Quebec unless you're already a coke head.  There are a lot of planting operations near Timmins and Hearst, and I spent about two weeks planting just outside of North Bay in my second year.  Pay is per tree and varies with location. In Manitoba, for example, the tree price was almost always $0.10 per tree. We were unionized which guaranteed us a minimum price, but also made it harder to raise the price over time. Overall being unionized is better than not, because it cut our $25/day camp costs in half ($12) and the monthly dues were only $60. Pays for itself in 5 days, and then you save for the rest of the month.  In Ontario the land is usually scarified (prepared) so planting is faster, but you also make less per tree ($0.08 when I was active). Overall I find it works out to about the same level of income, unless you can move just as fast in unprepared land as you can in prepared (not many people can).  In Alberta and BC prices are often $0.15 per tree, but you're also sideways on a mountain and planting 2/3s as many trees.  If you're seriously interested, February is the right time to apply. Here are some useful links:   http://www.replant.ca/index.html    This site is excellent. It's full of links for job opportunities, help for newbies, and more.   http://www.gear-up.com/products/category/equipment-6/tree-planting/   Gear Up is where I bought my planting bags, shovel, plot cord, and various other gear.    http://www.mec.ca/shop/gaiters/50110/   A lot of planters prefer to wear shorts to keep cool, but if you don't have something to protect your legs they'll get cut and scratched to hell. Buy some Gaiters from MEC.  Some other brands I can recommend from experience are Dakota and Caterpillar for boots, Nalgene for water bottles (You'll need a couple 1L bottles), and North Face for jackets and warm gear.  On my first day I planted 600 trees. By the end of the week I was planting 1600. My best day in the first season was 3400, but I only broke 3,000 one time that year. It's sort of the ""rite of passage"" for all rookies (in MB at least) to break 3,000 trees at least once in their first season.  By the end of my fourth year I was putting in between 3,500 and 4,000 per day, with my personal best at 4260 I believe. That's $426 + a $0.005 per tree bonus if they are happy with your quality that day (It pays for camp costs and adds up quickly). I was above average, but far from the best. We had a couple guys who could put in 5,000 trees a day in almost anything. They had also been at it for 10+ years.  The work itself pretty much sucks. I have to be honest. It's hard work. You haul around 50-100lbs of trees at a time, bend over and stick your hand in the ground 3,000 times a day, and you work in almost any weather imaginable. It's 9-10 hour days often in complete isolation aside from the occasional visit from your crewboss. But there are a few reasons why people go and keep going back   The money, obviously The people are unique and fantastic The parties are on another level entirely You get to travel around Canada You're doing something good for the environment You lose a lot of weight (I dropped 30lbs in my first year 20lbs a year after that) no matter what you eat You get to be outside, sometimes a little more than you'd like   Camp life makes it all worthwhile, as long as you're making good money to go with it.  Do you know the Barenaked Ladies? Their frontman, Ed Robertson, did a TV show called ""Ed's Up"" a few years ago where he basically pulled a Mike Row and did Canada's toughest jobs. One of them was tree planting, and the episode was filmed at my camp in my rookie year!  The full episode is up on YouTube. I highly recommend watching it.  I've also uploaded some video content of my own, including a montage from 2008 that focuses on the various kinds of transportation we use (vans, trucks, quads, rolligons, track machines, helicopters, footmobiles, etc), as well as some raw footage of me planting a bundle of trees, one of our daily morning meetings, and some heli footage. Don't forget the Fake Prom event. It goes nicely with Fake Halloween, Fake Christmas, and our other annual party themes :P  Also Fire Poi by the campfire.  Finally, I posted an AMA 4 years ago here on reddit. I probably remembered some things better back then.  Hope this helps!  Ask away if you want to know more."

Helicopters,2w9cai,she_did_what,3,Sat Feb 21 08:25:56 2015 UTC,"As an enthusiast/non-helicopterer - I've wondered this before - do helicopters get stabilised by changing the way the copter 'hangs' to always be effectively under the middle of the blades with regard to cog?  I.e. If two get in on the left of an r44, does it fly with the frame stuck out to the right?  Does this limit how quick you can roll left or right?"
Helicopters,2w9cai,coriolinus,6,Wed Feb 18 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on the design of the rotor. My background is Army aviation, so I've flown both types.  In Army flight school, they give you basic aviation training on a TH-67, which is functionally identical to a Bell 206. It has what's known as a semi-rigid rotor head, whose mechanical design forces the body to hang with the center of gravity under the rotor hub exactly as you imagined.   Not all helicopters are like that, though. More complex helicopters--for example, the UH-60--have what are known as fully articulated rotor heads. These are more mechanically complex, but have better aerodynamic characteristics. What matters here is that in a fully-articulated rotor system, the blades are hinged some distance from the rotor hub. In the case of a UH-60, that distance is a radius of about 18 inches. During flight, the centrifugal force exerted by the blades on the hub is quite large, and forces the hub to remain very nearly perfectly perpendicular to the plane of rotation at all times. This gives the pilots a quicker response to control inputs, reduces some of the effects of improper loading, and means that the CG is not necessarily under the hub. It does have to remain under the center of lift, mind you! But many situations can be compensated for with simple cyclic inputs."
Helicopters,2w9cai,she_did_what,2,Wed Feb 18 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"thanks I think I followed what you're saying, but now have another question;  Won't the semi-rigid rotor head be capable of the same 'trick' of having the effective 'center of lift' of the blades off to one side if the swash-plate is tilted (like the last photos in your link) - i.e. so on one side the blades are generating more lift?  Or do you mean by having the fully-articulated hub you can do this to a greater degree?  ( I guess I'm not following on what the benefit of the articulated hub is, but am now very interested and appreciate your input - your last description was really good & clear).  edit: looks like I partly get it through following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissymmetry_of_lift - it seems what's best will often not be the plane provided by the swash-plate with adjustment (teetering in your semi-rigid link)."
Helicopters,2w9cai,coriolinus,2,Wed Feb 18 07:48:53 2015 UTC,"No, in a semi-rigid rotor, the center of gravity will always hang under the hub. Mechanically, the blades can pivot on an axis passing through the hub's top; this is where the informal name for this design, ""seesaw rotor"", comes from.   Because the blades pivot at the hub, the plane of rotation is independent of the attitude of the body.   I did leave one part out, earlier. The CG must be under the hub in a hover. In forward flight, though, drag forces push back on the body of the helicopter, which is acting like a simple pendulum. This is why many semi-rigid helicopters have downward facing airfoils on the tail: to help counter this and keep the aircraft level in forward flight."
Helicopters,2w9cai,she_did_what,2,Wed Feb 18 08:08:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry I yes I think you've corrected that I misunderstood what swashplates do - I though they changed the pitch somewhat exclusively, and thought the blades just flexed about as forces dictate."
Helicopters,2w9cai,coriolinus,2,Wed Feb 18 08:34:37 2015 UTC,"Well, that's more or less correct. It's just that, in a fixed wing aircraft or a fully articulated helicopter, the pilot can set the attitude of the aircraft more or less directly.  In a semi rigid helicopter, by contrast, the pilot controls the plane of rotation; the aircraft takes some time to catch up after."
Helicopters,2w9cai,tarantulae,5,Wed Feb 18 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"So, the R44 is designed to hang... Shit, I might get this wrong. To hang right skid low. Then, when you put in fuel into the main tank, it hangs left skid low. Then, with a pilot, it hangs right skid low, then with a second passenger, back to the left. (Trying to remember how the tail rotor factors in, but I know it also tilts the Heli.  It's all about keeping the weight within the envelop of the flight controls. If you are too far outside the weight and balance, you can actually run out of stick movement and not be able to stop the roll or tilt."
Helicopters,2w9cai,ineptjedibob,7,Wed Feb 18 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"CCW helis usually hang left skid low due to the left cyclic required to counter translating tendency from the tail rotor thrust. If you have right CG it will hang more level, or possibly even right skid low. I've heard that some heli's incorporate a tilt in the main rotor mast instead, so the cyclic can stay more centered in a hover.  From the POH the skids are 86 inches apart, which means someone on the left skid would be at station -43. Assuming they are 200lbs you get a moment of -8600 per person, total -17,200. The right seat/baggage areas are +12.2 so to balance out with weight in the pilot seat/baggage and aft right seat/baggage you would need 1409lbs. Since you have 4 people in the heli, having that much ballast in those seats would put you over max gross, so they are definitely outside the lateral CG limits."

I have heard horror stories from fellow pilots about passengers not planning their poop schedules.  The best (worst) story is during a flight to an oil rig about 1.5 hours offshore.  Half way there, a passenger taps the pilot on the shoulder, and says that he REALLY needs to take a dump.  Since they are in the middle of the ocean, and basically equal distances from either spot, turing around would do nothing.

And of course plenty of folk made sure they had some big Gatorade or water bottles handy. Not many places to land on a 6 hour SAR flight over the ocean, ha. Never did see a female pilot or crewmember try to manage that though...   And as a crewmember if you had to poop the pilots' helmet bags were always available."

I prefer xplane over fsx and dcs both for realism in physics and extensibility. The built in aircraft are really limited but the payware aircraft i listed below have full systems and procedure simulation so you can either hop in and go or do a full start.  Autorotations are best done at gross weight otherwise the machines all tend to baloon a bit excessively on the flare.  You need a fairly beefy computer to really get the most out of any sim, however i have run xplane on my laptop when bored on tour.  For my 'home ftd' i use the following:  Software: Xplane 10.32 Nd bk117  with custom updated gns530w Dreamfoil 407  Dreamfoil 206  Dreamfoil as350b3 Xtrident b412 Foreflight pro on my ipad (connected via wifi gets s position of the virtual aircraft)  Scenery: Aipilotx hd mesh v3 70m terrain data (huge ram hog) Simheaven zl17 orthographic 70m v3 photoscenery for vancouver area Inside passage v10 Canadian rockies v10 Final frontier v10 Real terra haze  Hardware: Core i5 2500k at 4.6ghz 8gb ram (not enough, need 16gb) Geforce gtx 970 ""4gb"". I was running same setup on a 1.2gb 570 and could manage 24fps as long as i turned all the pretty graphics off and flew imc. 120gb ssd for xplane (scenery takes forever to load) Asus pb278q 1440p monitor gives a decent field of view and size  Flight controls: Saitek x-55 hotas with centring spring removed Saitek pro rudder pedals with centre pin and centring spring removed  Tweaking your control sensitivity and curves will allow you to fine tune to the poi t of satisfaction for yourself.  I find that with the springs removed on the x55 i can comfortably hold the cyclic as if it were a boosted loose 206 cyclic.  If you fly imc and want to use the flight director on the 412 or the 117 there is still a manual centring ring on the stick so you can use force trim and release the stick at centre.

I dont have enough experience with DCS to really compare the two but its pretty close flight wise and its got a huge selection of rotor aircraft, plus a modding community that adds in things like Hueys.

Helicopters,2vekwr,fatherjokes,11,Wed Feb 11 06:38:33 2015 UTC,"Here a story of what really got me into aviation (helis included);  It was at my friends cottage in the Kawarthas in Ontario. We were there for a weekend in the summer of 08. And it just came down, god's wrath style. Even though we were in a well built log cabin, it felt like it was going to get washed into a lake (which funnily enough is called ""Catchacoma""). Halfway throgh the storm the power goes and and the winds get worse. We eventually held out till the next day.   We decided to take the boat out to the lake to survey the damage, It was pretty bad. There had been a tornado that had ripped through a couple of cottages (no one was inside) and taken out a main power line.   We were just parked near the middle of the lake, when we hear the distinctive sound of a two blade heli. It grew louder and louder and came to a roar as (I think) a yellow and red UH-1 flew no more than a 100ft above the lake carrying a telephone pole. Being about 16 and having a boat and nothing better to do, we caught up to it while the pilot gently lowered the telephone pole into position. We must have sat there and watched these guys do this for over two hours (there were two helis working) with a ground team setting everything up.   One of the helis finally decided to land in a nearby clearing, we made our way over to where they had landed and wanted to get a closer look at this thing. The two pilots were really friendly and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about showing us around the heli. I think they were amused at the fact that I found every square inch of that aircraft intersting. We finally said goodybe and made our way back to the cottage but not before a special treat, as we were gunning it across the lake (probably 60ish km/h) the guys in the heli deviated from their route to do a flyby about 50ft off our port side going really fast and really low (im guessing around 30ft or so off the lake).   Man it was AWESOME."

Well there we were on final to the taxiway while an airplane (which we assumed would use the RUNWAY to land) was on his base leg behind us. As we continued my normal approach, at about 80' AGL my instructor felt his spidey senses tingling. He called the airplane and asked if he can see the helicopter (us) on final to the taxiway. Right after he said that, the plane's shadow appeared off my right shoulder as the poor devil desperately attempted to bank over to the runway. He was about to land right on top of us.

Helicopters,2vekwr,Bananarine,3,Wed Feb 11 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"I used to work as a tree planter during the summers to pay for school. We had several different heli pilots over the years to access land that was logged using winter roads (lakes and rivers, marsh land, swamps, etc. all freeze in the winter and can be driven on, but in the summer they require helicopters to get us in and out).    Our first pilot in my very first year was a former Chilean army pilot. Needless to say, he was a lot of fun. If we were the last group out for the day he would often take a longer route back to camp and fit some contour and NOE flight in along the way for fun.  He lost his wrench for opening the fuel barrels one time (it was under his sling net...) so he kicked the barrel on its side and took an axe to it instead. We quickly determined how many people in camp thought it was going to explode when they all started screaming and running for cover.  Unfortunately they fired him after he landed too close to one of his fuel barrels and struck the tail rotor on it, stranding 23 people in a clear cut for 8 hours until they could fly another heli in from the nearest town to help.    One of our other pilots dropped a quad (ATV) from 500ft. He blamed mechanical failure, but I don't think anyone believed him."

I was dead set, gung-ho ready for ROTC at Norwich University (private military school where ROTC started). Went there and actually hated it and everything boot camp related about the military. Left, ended up at current school studying Criminal Justice because I thought maybe I should be a police officer instead. Naturally I wanted to fly for any criminal justice agency, but specifically for Homeland Security and Border Patrol. Learned enough about criminal justice through classes and ride alongs that I also do not want anything to do with law enforcement. Now I'm a senior at my school and wondering what the hell I should do to pay for flight school.  Moral of the story: Just fly.

Only thing I could advise is do it in an R22 since it's essentially half the price of a 44. And/or you could find a flight school which uses aircraft other than Robinson for training. There's a few schools that fly Schweizers and a few less that fly Enstroms. Also,I hear that Guimbal Cabri is coming up in the world.  If you transitioned to helicopters now, and went through CFII, I'm willing to bet you'd take out a solid chunk of that 200. That would probably involve abandoning your current course though..which is definitely a commitment."

Helicopters,2vgqce,Exalted_Leader_Morse,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:32:17 2015 UTC,I am dual rated and CFI in both.  I would advise you to stick with airplanes.  Helicopters are cool but the market is highly saturated with low time helicopter pilots who have very expensive ratings that they can't do anything with.  Most of the guys I know are desperate for helicopter work and doing other menial jobs in the meantime.   The market for fixed wing is in high demand for pilots.  Stick with that route and then when your making $200 an hour and working 10-14 days a month for the airlines buy or rent a helicopter for fun.    Starting wages are low for airplane but 2nd or 3rd year you are already passing up what pilots with 2000 hours are making in helicopters.  I got picked up with a commuter airline with less than 300 hours as a FO.  I had a lot more helicopter time so my overall PIC time was high.  But we have other pilots who got picked up fresh out of school with wet ink on their certificates roughly 250 hours to work as a FO till they had the required 1200 hours.  When I started I got roughly $20 an hour.  After upgrade a few months later that bumps to over $40 an hour.    I fly roughly 100 to 120 a month working roughly 4 days a week.    You wont see that type of money in helicopters for 3 or 4 years if you are lucky.

Helicopters,2vgqce,Cropgun,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Your experience is the exception not the norm.  Yes I have heard of the rare few who had your luck but maybe less than 5 or 10% of helicopter pilots are this fortunate.  While it does happen it is extremely rare.    What field are you working in?  I am assuming Agriculture Crop dusting by your screenname and other posts.  These are very lucrative positions and in MOST cases you do ground work (like driving the fuel or Chemical trucks) for years before you get in the air.    The other issue is, how much are you flying?  You might be making $150 an hour, but only flying 10 hours a week.    I fly 100 to 120 a month every month.  The guys we've hired fresh out of flight school with 250-350 hours fly roughly the same.  So while the hourly rate might be low the total adds up quickly.  Where you might be making 150 an hour but only flying 2 or 3 hours a day.    Either way, you may not realize it but you are extremely fortunate to be in the position you are."

I'm not saying it is the industry standard, I'm just trying to let people know its not as dire as it may seem.  The industry doom and gloom around this subreddit is bringing me down.  :)   What field are you working in?   I am an ag pilot yes.   I worked briefly doing pipeline patrol.  Very briefly.  And yes, there is some ground crew work involved with ag flying, just like with most utility flying, especially if you're a low timer.   If you're stuck driving a truck for years, it probably means you're not living up to the standards of your employer.   Food for thought: A lot of the guys around me and that I meet out and about all passed up the ""be a CFI until I have enough time to do something else"" route.     The other issue is, how much are you flying?   As much as 300-400 hrs a month.  During peak season, you can clear 20k a week.  I probably fly 600-700hrs a year.  And have 4-6 months off to be at home with my wife before I hit the road again.  I also use this 4-6 months to earn a little ""hobby cash"" if I choose.  I work at the local FBO for fun these days.

The EC145 is a twin-engine aircraft and can carry up to nine passengers along with two crew, depending on customer configuration. The helicopter is marketed for passenger transport, corporate transport, emergency medical services (EMS), search and rescue, parapublic and utility roles.

Helicopters,2tvzch,desiderata2012,10,Tue Jan 27 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"Is this a S/naval variant light? In A/L at least (I'd assume M as well) we have a separation between #1 and #2, as opposed to what seems based on what you've provided, to be one single light.   For example: if there were to be a leak in a first stage primary servo, you would first get a #1 Rsvr low caution, (as well as #1 tail rtr servo caution and backup pump and #2 tail rtr servo on advisories, attempting to isolate the leak in the t/r servo/lines to it) Obviously it's not there, so the leak continues. (no EP for this procedure)   You'd next see the #1 hyd pump caution, as #1 pump pressure drops below 2000psi, so LDI (leak detection and isolation) would return pressure to the #1 t/r servo. The system has tried to isolate upstream of the #1 xfer module in the pump.  We're now in a land as soon as practicable EP.  So... The leak is continuing. We now get a back-up rsvr low. This is a continuation of the previously mentioned EP. corrective action is to place the SVO OFF switch to isolate the first stage, and land as soon as possible.  The warning here, is that if the #2 primary servo appears, to establish a landing attitude, minimize control inputs and begin a descent. (things are about to get interesting.)   There's another equivalent sequence if the leak is in the second stage, initially. Anyway....   So, we don't have a ""HYD"" caution, which is why I ask. I also laid it out because a) it's a good refresher for me, and b) to show the differences, if any.   I would suspect that your ""LAND IMMEDIATELY"" is what's indicated in our warning. Namely, the moment you have an indication that it's about to get real bad, you need to start the landing process while you still have hyd pressure, and controllability.   Also, yes, it is uncontrollable with no hyd pressure in the primary servos. It's not hydraulic assist (TH-57), it's hydraulic operation."

Helicopters,2tvzch,BosoxH60,3,Wed Jan 28 00:39:05 2015 UTC,"60R IP and former 60B guy, here. The hyd warning is particular to the 60S and 60R glass cockpits and, so far as I know, have never occurred in the wild. It's an indication that you've lost pressure in both #1 and #2 hyd systems, and that the aircraft is, or very shortly will be, totally uncontrollable.  The LDI you describe sounds the same as ours, which means there's no simple emergency that would cause both #1 and #2 to bleed dry. I don't know enough about what's going on inside the transfer/utility modules to know that it's impossible -- I'd defer to a Sikorsky engineer for that level of detail -- but the common wisdom is that you can only get to a hyd warning by multiple independent failures, like battle damage.  NATOPS spends very little effort describing this condition, and we spend very little time training for it, since there's really no remedial action left to perform."
Helicopters,2tvzch,Xmonty,6,Wed Jan 28 04:52:21 2015 UTC,As a civil pilot reading this thread
Helicopters,2tvzch,BrolecopterPilot,5,Thu Jan 29 05:29:44 2015 UTC,"Xmonty summed it up well.  It was always part of the HYD EPs in the -60F/H, but only as the final stage in a multiple system failure.  The 60R/S digital cockpit just added a light and additional EP for it.  To the OP, something I think is interesting to note:   ""The order in which the hydraulic emergency will present itself should allow the pilot early indications of the impending failure.""   I've experienced practically every emergency possible in the -60 at this point and this quote always makes me laugh.  If the system is correctly serviced, each HYD pump only has about .86 quart in it and the system operates at 3000psi.  If you have leak the HYD system will piss out its fluid very quickly.  If you have major damage to both systems such that you would get a dual HYD failure, it will happen even quicker.    This is one of those emergencies where the book is wrong and you will not have early indications of a failure, when it goes, it will go fast and you better hope you gave your due diligence in the sims."
Helicopters,2tvzch,lowflier,2,Wed Jan 28 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks. OP is not alone in thinking it's a weird indication. Before the advent of the R/S glass cockpit WCA system, we only had the last step of the hyd malfunction EPs: if failure is imminent - land immediately. That was even more cryptic, because NATOPS had nothing to say about how or why that could happen, leaving is to speculate our ways to the same conclusion: Battle damage or other such exotic compound emergency.   I'm on board with the low-capacity, high-pressure observation. I've never had a hyd leak. How'd it go? How fast did the light show present itself? Was the sim accurate?"
Helicopters,2tvzch,Xmonty,2,Wed Jan 28 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"The modeling in the sim for how long it takes is inaccurate.  If you have a leak such that you lose fluid in #1 or #2 primary, and subsequently start to bleed out your B/U pump fluid, the process is quick enough that you almost don't even catch the fact that the B/U pump came on in the first place.  The decision to secure a primary servo via the collective switch should be almost immediate."

There are also regulations for the renewal of class rating (PPL/CPL), but the legalese is a bit above me.   At any rate, this means that to continue to be allowed to work as a helicopter pilot, you will have to fly. During the time you are employed as a ground handler, will you be paying for that flight time (even if it's just an R22, it's still expensive...) or will the company pay for this on the grounds that you will eventually be flying for them?

What would you think if someone posted they just got their JAA license in Germany and wanted to fly in the USA?  Your first thought would be that you have to get a US license (or should be).  Also, I have never heard of anyone getting a license in any other country asking if they can fly in the USA.  Its ALWAYS Americans asking to fly in other countries.  There are certain places that require US ratings, like Guam, because it is a US territory. But you wont get a tuna boat job in Guam at 200 hours.  As it happens, the USA is a bit of ""the wild west"" and isn't as safe as Americans think it is.  For example, I think the USA is the only country that allows single pilot IFR commercial operations (medivac helicopters for example).  All other countries that I have heard of require two pilots for safety, and have a much higher safety rate as result.  Medivac safety in the USA is so poor they were talking of getting rid of it a few years ago.  San Francisco doesn't allow medivac helicopters at all.  Regardless, you'll need a work permit.  I would look at websites of countries you are thinking of working in to see about a work permit, though I think you'll find it hard to get one.  Work permits are usually issued for specialized workers, not people with little to no experience.  The one exception I heard was a guy who, 15 years ago, got an S-76 endorsement for SIC so he could get a job in China.  He was fresh out of flight school and paid A LOT for that endorsement.  The work permit was not an issue for him, but that was 15 years ago.  Good luck on your search, though.  Its tough making a first break.  Sorry if my original response came off a bit harsh.

Two sharp banks cause rotor gear to fail on a $10 million helicopter?  Summary of Events Leading to Mishap:  At 2011 (local time – Hawaii) on Sept 4, 2008, a Coast Guard helicopter (CG-6505) was conducting night time hoist training with CG Small Boat (CG-47317).  Hoist training consists of hovering over the deck of the boat and lowering and raising a basket with the helicopter hoist.  During one of the hoist evolutions, the helicopter got closer to the deck of the small boat than the pilot intended.  The pilot reacted by increasing altitude quickly.  Simultaneously, the hoist cable entangled itself on a deck fitting (aft buoyancy chamber de-watering standpipe) of CG-47317.  The entangled cable caused CG-6505 to roll hard left  The cable parted and the CG-6505 rolled hard right  Hard rolls caused damage to CG-6505’s main gear box (interface between engines and rotors)  CG-6505 flies away from CG-47317 heading toward the CG Air Station  CG-6505 catches on fire and crashes into the water  All four (4) people on board (pilot, co-pilot, flight mechanic, rescue swimmer) die on impact."

Heli's are used to spot schools of fish from the air, but also use for low level flying to try and keep them contained within the net while it's being pursed.   Generally you don't fish while you're on the boat....it's a purse seiner and it's job is to be catching fish or looking for fish. No time for relaxing with a rod and reel.  You don't only eat fish.

Curious how much truth there was to that.
Helicopters,2tbli7,jcav8r,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on a few factors. Vessels of different flag states (Chinese boats vs. US boats for example) will have different standards and operating procedures and different levels of control over their pilots. Some boat owners own their helicopters, while others use leasing companies. In the case of our company, our boats are all under US flag but we lease R44's from a New Zealand based company--they handle all of the hiring/firing of pilots and mechanics and generally keep them well maintained. The world, and the industry, has evolved a lot and safety naturally becomes a bigger priority as time goes on. Insurance is a bigger deal now and you have to be able to cover your ass. It can still be a very dangerous and demanding place to fly but it is for sure no longer the wild west out there. The thing about tuna fishing is that you can have two very, very different experiences on two different boats. Some conditions can be extremely harsh, while you might find that life on one of our boats is actually quite comfortable."

Another lacked knowledge in basic navigation, while these seem like small misses it is the norm from Hillsboro (From what we've seen)  I have met quite a few of their instructors, they have all been nice and seemed like good aviators, but word on the street is that when you get close to your 1,000 hours they ask you to leave, which may be fine for some, but not so much for others. While not all is bad coming out of Hillsboro, they have a pretty good safety record and almost everyone does seem nice. They have a lot of students, so I'm assuming that the instructors don't have much time for one on one training.  Now other part 141 schools in the area include Upper Limit, which seems like a decent school, but they have a pretty large accident record. Leading Edge is another one, and then there is Green River which is run by a guy many many people aren't too fond of. The school I work for is called Inland Helicopters, our 141 program is in Moses Lake, WA. We are a small school that is growing steadily, partnered with Big Bend Community College.   Most of our students are using the post 9/11 GI Bill, and though I know that benefits vary on individual situation, all of our students are having all their flight hours and schooling paid for. We also have an on site VA rep, and very good safety record.   Now in all reality, anyone can fly helicopters, you could go to any one of these schools and probably come out with around the same amount of hours and the ability to fly. Its all the other knowledge that comes with the job, and being able to fly the machine safely is one of the most important things you can learn, I would personally look into accident records of each school.   Like I said, I work for a competitor of Hillsboro, so take my response with a grain of salt, but take a look into our program, and I will answer any more questions you have to the best of my ability.  www.inlandhelicopters.com  Here is the page about our 141 program http://www.inlandhelicopters.com/?page_id=133  Cheers!"
Helicopters,2t8kyr,Paperplains,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"Now Hillsboro is a big school, they specialize in foreign asian students   We often talk about the CFI/CFI-I retention of schools here. What's the norm for these Asian students? Do they often stay on as instructors? AFAICT the best shot at going from the ~200h of CFI training to the ~1000h ""magical number"" for employability is to get hired by the school you trained at as a CFI/CFI-I. Do these clearly substandard students get employment as instructors up to 1000-ish hours? Or do they ""just"" do CPL/IR and then bugger off again?"
Helicopters,2t8kyr,SeraphTwo,1 point,Thu Jan 22 12:53:37 2015 UTC,"As far as I know a lot of them go back to wherever they came from. For example there was a Chinese girl going through her commercial recently, who was hired or selected or whatever by the government to fly their police helicopters. The government sent her to Hillsboro for her ratings then she is headed right back to her new job which she is already contracted into for at least 10 years of co-piloting before they even give her a change at PIC. And if she leaves they probably shame her whole family or whatever. The point is, as far as I know most of the Asian student leave but some stay. Now Hillsboro doesn't solely consist of foreign students, so I'm sure there is still competition for the CFI jobs."
Helicopters,2t8kyr,Paperplains,2,Thu Jan 22 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thanks! I realize there is still competition, but a slight advantage is still an advantage when you're talking about a 70-100k investment in training.   Compared to, say, Bristow Academy down in Florida where probably 80-90% of the ab initio trainees are doing everything through CFI-I, if even 20-30% of all students are just there for CPL/IR, that would immediately increase your chance of being taken on as an instructor.  Maybe I'm over-analyzing this, but I'm trying to gather/process as much information as possible. As a European considering training in the USA on a visa, efficiency and maximizing my chances are paramount."
Helicopters,2t8kyr,SeraphTwo,2,Thu Jan 22 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"Ciao! what /u/paperplains said.  I work at leading edge over the mountains in Bend, and we see ALOT of transfer students. Our Chief Flight instructor Karl Cotton is a DPE that does some check rides there on occasion and he says that they don't usually meet PTS (practical test standards) on the First check ride.  Also from what I understand Hillsbrough just sold or something like that? so I'm not sure how much longer they will be doing Flight training anyway.  I might Look at /U/paperplains 's school cause trying to find housing Here in Bend is like trying to find two hot lesbians that will let you watch... but at the same time we do Night Vision Goggle training , and that is something you cant get anywhere but a few places, in fact I'm going to go out on a limb and say I don't know of any other VA approved school that does it, I'm probably wrong but none come to mind. Upper Limits offers a bachelors program and I heard that Cedar City is pretty cool place to live, but I also heard you are just a number there so....  Mi dispiace that I'm not more help, the decision is up to you. I went to leading edge and had everything paid for through the post 911, I actually finished the Degree on the VocRehab program through the VA because i spent 24months of GI bill on becoming a BMW master Tech first. so even if you ""run out"" which you wont there are always options. Also when I got out of the Marines I totally lived off the BAH ($1330 at the time) things were... are always tight but do-able. I've never missed a payment on anything, but then again I don't have any debt so that helps a lot. you will also get FASFA while going to school. your first year will suck cause of your wages from the millitary, but the next years after that, you could get a decent check, then just ration that out for food, bills, gas, and school supplies. You should have enough left over that you can go out to the movies and enjoy things while not being like Daddy warbucks. Some guys pick up a part time at the airport fuling for the school or helping in Maintenance depending on your previous experiences, but most dont again up to you. Which ever VA approved school you choose, there will be plenty of people just like you, doing the exact same thing you are while having all the same problems and questions. feel free to PM me if there is anything I can do to help you (I've moved out and back to the US Before I know how hard it can be).  for the last bit of your questions, you'll have about 250hrs or so which will get you shit in the industry (unless you have a brother whose cousin knows a guy if you catch my meaning) you will have all the ratings except for ATP (including Private which turns into a commercial when you get that, Instrument rating, Flight instructor and Flight instructor for Instruments. If you do leading edge you will also get Night Vision Goggle instructor). You will also have a Associates in Applied science or a Bachelors of something if you go to Upper Limits.  Good luck"

While I'm new to the helicopter program here, I've done fixed wing training at other part 141 and 61 schools, and so far it seems like a quality flight school. The schedule can get pretty full, but the company is expanding and there are more helicopters being added.    Housing can be hard to come by here, but there are options. I personally found two student roommates on craigslist and it all worked out really well.  The school here, Central Oregon Community College, also has temporary housing for veterans while you look for a permanent setup. Not sure on the specifics, but I've heard about it and have seen posters with the information.   Also, it doesn't really apply to helicopter flight training, but you should look into UCX unemployment for immediately after you separate. It is a decent amount of money and can really help to make the military-to-civilian transition much smoother. Most of the ex-service members that I've talked to about it (and myself) were able to keep unemployment benefits while starting school (while you're still collecting GI bill BAH!!).

Helicopters,2t686i,stunt_penguin,9,Wed Jan 21 14:29:13 2015 UTC,You're better off renting a light single and doing it that way.  You could even orbit from a 172 or something like that.  You tell me you're going to film me with a drone that will be moving around on my job site while I'm trying to winch somebody off a mountain and I'm going to tell you to pound sand.
Helicopters,2t686i,Cropgun,3,Wed Jan 21 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"Drones are very tiny and hard to see, you're probably going to have a hard time convincing the pilots/ insurance lawyers to let you do that. Drones also seem like they'd get tossed around in by the wind a lot. Just seems awfully dangerous to have one flying so close to an operating helicopter.   Who's going to be flying the drone? You? How will you communicate with the helicopter(s)?   A safer option might be chartering a light utility helicopter to take you and your camera up."
Helicopters,2t686i,GillicuttyMcAnus,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"Principally we'd be picking a lowland area on a day with only a few knots of wind - the drone in question has an excellent power-to-weight ratio and will resist 10m/s of adverse wind without a problem.  The craft would be operated by me from a first-person perspective (transmitting the camera image to a pair of goggles) with a pair of spotters and a ground-to-air radio operator beside me on the ground.    We'd allow the Heli to move into position, have the drone take off from more than 200m away and make the pass while the helicopter works, then land before the helicopter needs to move again.  If the heli needs to move or make an emergency maneuver the drone can be headed away at 20m/s or on the ground in 5 seconds flat (just cut the engines and go down hard if abs. necessary).  Done carefully it can be a safe procedure and provide some stunning footage...... whether that footage is worth the bother or not is up to the Coast Guard!"
Helicopters,2t686i,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:05:28 2015 UTC,That actually doesn't sound bad at all.  I'd want you at least 100ft away from the helicopter.  Surely you have a camera with a zoom right?
Helicopters,2t686i,achwas,-1,Wed Jan 21 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"What I really want is a grand landscape shot with the heli as a relatively small feature.  My reckoning was that the smaller craft would need to be at least 150 feet/50 meters away- 100 feet would be pretty dreamy acutally, haha..... it doesn't need to be anything close or intimate, though- that's for the guys on the ground wearing GoPros! :)   Thinking about it further we could plot a line on the ground with a spotter at each end that defines my closest boundary of approach. I'd plan a straight flight path along that line and any accidental deviation inside that zone would be immediately spotted and could be relayed by either person via the radio. That way I could have ""my"" temporary airspace and the heli has theirs."
Helicopters,2t686i,tarantulae,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I find it extremely unlikely that a pilot would agree to this. The pilot is ultimately responsible for the safety of the aircraft and the passengers. By agreeing to have you fly a drone around it in close proximity (50m is far enough that it won't get sucked in, but still close proximity for all intents and purposes. As is 100m.), they essentially allow an unnecessary and additional risk to the flight to happen, over which they have no control. All that in a high stress environment. They will say, what if you lose control over the drone for some reason. What if there is some sort of severe gust, or the helicopter has to make an unplanned rapid manoeuvre or whatever. What if the drone simply proves to be distracting.  In this day and age there will be a formal, written risk assessment process to go through. They most likely even have one for every flight that they do - they will definitely require it for an operation that is out of the ordinary. The result of that will be that it is not worth it to allow the drone to get close to the machine. They will say that there is a safer way of doing this, and that is to use another manned aircraft at a greater distance, such as a fixed wing or helicopter and a longer telephoto lens. Or even a larger drone with more powerful camera equipment. The fact that this will be a bit more expensive will not interest them one bit.  They will not allow any unnecessary risk to their crew and their multi-million dollar aircraft and operation, just to save a few hundred dollars on the cost of filming it."

Helicopters,2t384x,zippyajohn,5,Tue Jan 20 23:51:45 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the helicopter design and more specifically, the tail rotor design/authority.  As /u/Optamix said below/above, the Comanche didn't have a set limit for sideward flight.  The Fantail design and theoretical Horsepower of the engines provided enough lift in the tail rotor for all modes of flight.  I read another commenters reasoning about sideward flight    As fast as the tail rotor can handle I'd imagine. Don't really want to find out. I've been sideways with the relative wind coming at me from 90 degrees left or right at speeds probably approaching 40-50mph.

If you actually get to the edge of the physical capabilities of the rotor system, you lose ability to maintain flight condition.   As long as you have tail rotor authority, and DO NOT exceed the design limits for sideward/rearward flight for the specific helicopter, you will be fine.  I think /u/swissarmypants  stated that the Apache has 45 kts limit, that is correct for tail rotor authority by the -10, design limits are in the -23 manual and allow up to 90 kts before ""inspections"".  I have been up to 95kts going right slide in the AH-64 and 60 kts going left.  It is all a matter of structural integrity and tail rotor authority."

Helicopters,2t384x,achwas,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"Does the Notar still work with that much cross wind though? I have never flown one, but I kinda doubt it. This machine depends a lot on forward airflow for yaw stability when in forward flight, it even has an articulated vertical stab. In a hover, a lot of the anti-torque comes from tail boom strakes, and I doubt that they would work in any significant cross wind."
Helicopters,2t384x,iamkokonutz,0,Wed Jan 21 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that a portion of the thrust come from air being pushed out the end of the tail cone, as well as Venturi (Coanda)? effect. (one of the 2 of those.)  I found this.  The effectiveness of this system is such that the 52ON is approved for hovering in 30-knot crosswinds and has been flown sideways at speeds significantly higher. Pilots will find the 52ON requires only about one fifth the pedal displacement of a comparable conventional helicopter. Why? To take one example, the blades of a conventional tail rotor undergo constantly changing angles of attack due to changing airflow, particularly in gusty wind conditions, requiring the pilot to compensate with pedal inputs. With Notar, the issue is largely moot.  Can't find any videos though."
Helicopters,2t384x,achwas,1 point,Wed Jan 21 06:33:32 2015 UTC,"interesting. The only feedback I have from pilots is that the anti torque takes some getting used to, and that you are better off just letting it point itself into wind. I guess that doesn't mean that the NOTAR isn't powerful, just that it might be a bit tricky to control."

Helicopters,2sptha,TurdMurder,3,Sat Jan 17 07:38:32 2015 UTC,"It all depends.  What are your finances like?  Can you afford to fly helicopters recreationaly at all?  It is significantly more expensive and if you want to take longer trips and carry more people like you would in a fixed wing its even more expensive.   What is it that you want to do flying?  Do you want to go long distances, or share flying with a number of people at a time?  Is it about the destinations rather than the trip?  Go fixed wing.    Do you want to be able to touch down in a field or the woods and shut down and walk around, go helicopter.  A lot of this depends on where you live.  If you are in a heavily built up area where it may be illegal to land off your own property (or even there) then you'll be airport to airport anyway.    If you want to fly yourself and one other person around the local area it's not too bad.    If you only plan on flying a little bit of the time then I say go helicopters only, the experience you get from fixed wing won't really help you fly the helicopters (it will help with general knowledge) and some of the habits will actually get you hurt.    Fixed wings are faster, cheaper, have longer loiter times and carry more people."
Helicopters,2sptha,AirWolf412,2,Sat Jan 17 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean flying for fun, as opposed to a Recreational license.  I can't tell you what is right for you, but I can share my experience. I got my PPL-ROT as a hobby with no intentions of doing it as a career. I make ~$70K/y and live like a college student, so my disposable income is perhaps twice or more what a similar person with normal financial obligations might be. I spent about half my half my post tax income getting my license in 2013, and had saved up so I could do it all at once. I've flown about 10 hours since then because once the light at the end of the tunnel disappeared (my checkride), the thought of spending $300/h didn't seem so smart any more. I will be transitioning to fixed wing in the coming months so I can afford to sustain flying more than a couple hours a month.  If helicopters is what you really want to fly, then by all means learn to fly them first. I certainly don't regret my training, and I plan to come back to helicopters eventually (I've got my eyes on a helicycle kit-built), but I think for right now, a lot of the skills I need to polish can be done so in an airplane for 1/3 the cost.

Helicopters,2sptha,Exalted_Leader_Morse,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"Practicality wasn't the word used.    What was said was it will be hard to find anyone who will rent an helicopter to you to fly solo or take friends for a ride solo.  The school you train at for your private might allow you post check ride if you are looking to continue to build hours or add ratings.    But if you leave the area and try to go to another school ""most"" of the time you will not be able to rent solo.  This is more often than not an insurance issue.  The insurance company often will not allow someone off the street to rent aircraft solo, unlike fixed wing FBOs.

Pull any more collective, lose RPM, lose more lift, descent and spin due to high torque and low TR RPM. Pull more collective in panic, crash.  If I had a dollar for every time an inexperienced or shitty pilot crashes an R44 in this exact way, I could probably buy one..."

They should have had enough power to do this, but they still managed to go to full throttle on what should have been a standard steep approach. He was stirring the cyclic and jamming the pedals left and right on both attempts (the second one was cross- or down wind), and he might have been death gripping the throttle on top of that, too. The back seat passenger certainly had white knuckles.  Overpitching caused by poor flying technique."

Helicopters,2sb9o9,vORP,2,Tue Jan 13 19:34:48 2015 UTC,@3:02 you can see the shadow of the tail rotor not moving. My best guess is the tail rotor hit the fence that you see a few seconds before.
Helicopters,2sb9o9,troglodytis,10,Tue Jan 13 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"The accident report below, translated says:  During the investigation has not found any evidence that points to equipment failure.  While trying to stabilize the aircraft on the ground, the pilot realized the approach several children. To avoid a catastrophic event, he quickly fired the collective command up in order to leave the area by means of a take-off vertically. By doing this, the pilot heard the low audible alarm RPM main rotor and was not able to counteract the torque generated by the control application collective. The helicopter performed a 360º rotation around its vertical axis."

If I had to guess I would say settling with power and/or loss of tail rotor effectiveness.  Clearly they are in a state of low rotor RPM (the horn), but the video is not so great, I can't really tell what it's from.  Heck, they may have even hit the tail rotor on the way in for all I know."
Helicopters,2sb9o9,BrolecopterPilot,3,Tue Jan 13 19:46:07 2015 UTC,Here is the accident report. (in Portuguese) He did make contact with the ground before he tried ripping out the collective. I'll translate more when I get back. (gotta play soccer)

Helicopters,2sb9o9,lolhaibai,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:23:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure but it looks like after he touched the ground or near it something/someone pushed the collective. That would kinda of explain the horn and the torque.
Helicopters,2sbf7y,velliin,5,Tue Jan 13 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely classic over pitching accident caused by super shitty piloting technique. And by the decision to land an R44 with 4 grown men on board in a tight landing site well above sea level.  At around 1:19 he is trying to land in a confined area. He is at 3,500ft AMSL from what I can see on the altimeter, which means ambient air pressure is roughly 26-26.5"". That means the engine will only produce about 25"" MAP at full wide open throttle. You can briefly see the MAP gauge sitting on the 25"" mark around 1:19. So basically that helicopter is operating at full throttle, but because the pilot keeps pulling the collective up, the rotor RPM decays. As if he is trying to drive a car up a steep hill in 5th gear. You can hear the RPM decay before the horn comes on. The following partial loss of control is due to reduced main rotor RPM as well as tail rotor thrust (due to low RPM), which causes yaw, which causes the pilot to freak out and tense up on the controls.  They recover and then try the landing again. The second approach seems a bit rushed, I can see very low power (indicating a flare) at around 2:05 just before they stop. There is also a cross wind, looking at the trim strings. They stop in a high hover and attempt to descent vertically, which of course takes a lot of power especially in cross wind conditions. This time they seem to make it almost to the ground before they lose RPM yet again. For some reason the next thing we see is the machine back in the air, out of control, with the horn still blaring. Chances are the guy panicked and tried to pull out of the landing site despite having not enough power. At that point the only recovery would be to reduce collective pitch to give the engine a chance to recover RPM, gain some forward airspeed while trying to dodge the obstacles in front, and fly away. For some reason, he does none of the above and loses more and more RPM until they finally hit something.  I normally restrain myself from making these kind of comments about accidents without seeing the report, however this kind of crash is so INCREDIBLY common in R44s that I would have bet a years worth of flight pay on the outcome after hearing the RPM droop at 1:17"
Helicopters,2sbf7y,achwas,1 point,Wed Jan 14 06:49:52 2015 UTC,so basically they shouldn't have flown there with so many people in the helicopter in the first place? Or the solution was to find somewhere less tight to land?
Helicopters,2sbf7y,jduquenn,2,Wed Jan 14 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they were over max weight, they might have been depending on how much fuel and baggage they had. If they were within weight limits, they should have at least found a more open landing spot.  I can't say for sure if it would have been theoretically possible to make the landing there if the pilot had been smoother on the controls and made a better approach - for this you would need to know the exact weight of the machine at the time, the temperature and the air pressure  but my guess is no. At least it would have been marginal, so without a very good reason to land there it would have been an unnecessary risk.  Edit: I checked and you can see the fuel gages in the video, they are pretty low around 1/3 on the main tank. That means they were probably under max weight depending on what they had under the seats. Also it's a R44 Raven II which isn't too bad at 3,500ft. So they may have been within the capabilities of the machine. However that assumes smooth flying, no erratic control movements, and no excessive collective input.  It is pretty safe to say that this pilot overestimated his abilities and wasn't very familiar with the performance margins of this machine."

Helicopters,2s7z3t,2BeansApps,3,Tue Jan 13 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, so here is my general thoughts after trying it for only 5 minutes. It's not meant to be overly negative, as it's MUCH better than anything I could pull off. Just some feedback that made me want to stop after 5 minutes. It could be I was missing something as well...  I'm on a Galaxy S4.   The menu options were really small. I don't consider myself as having large fingers, but I hit the wrong option several times because they are too small. The HOV hold seemed to do nothing at all. The HOV and ATT holds would be much better as toggles, not press and holds. This way you could scout targets and use weapons with the toggled active. The biggest issue was there was no instrumentation! I have no idea how fast I'm going or what my power setting is. I know there is the collective ""slider"", but without a percentage output, you basically have to guess the power.   Again, not trying to be overly negative, just some constructive criticism. I'll give it another try and update if need be."

The medical is your student certificate so that should be priority one before setting foot in the school. The school you attend probably has an orientation that sorts all that out.   Regarding the transmission failure, that is actually one of the more serious failures you can have. If an engine goes you just autorotate down. If a transmission seizes, you're toast.

I joined at 21 with a college degree, if you're a solid ""no"" I got it, it's not for everyone.  But if you have any questions or you're on the fence I'm always happy to talk about my experiences, I also did an AMA after my first tour that got some upvotes. Also /r/military is a good community and they have some FAQ's.   If you're looking for a perspective that may be more honest than a recruiter and more experienced than a civilian ask away.  I didn't do the flight program though, I was Infantry."

Helicopters,2rw2l4,redbarnes,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:45:52 2015 UTC,If you are doing your training with Advanced Helicopters you will find no better school or instructors.      The owner Neil has been in aviation for something like 30 years and flies everything.  He's a great guy and easy to approach.  He takes care of his people and his aircraft are very well maintained.    I've flown with 16 different schools as both a student and instructor (been doing this a while myself) and not one other school has come close to the professionalism and knowledge exhibited by Neil and his staff.    It's been over 10 years since I last flew with them.  But I still keep in touch with some of them.  I ran into their head of maintenance at the Robinson Safety course last year and he still remembered me after all these years.    Good luck with your training.  And make sure to stay well clear of P- 40 to the north.  ;-p

Helicopters,2rszky,multicactus,6,Fri Jan 9 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"You said ELI5 so here it goes...  Magnetos are what provide the electricity to make the spark which catches the mixture of gas and air on fire in the engine. Rather than being supplied with electrical current from the electrical system (battery or alternator) the magneto uses a magnet that is spun by the engine to produce the electrical current. Magnetos are used so that if the battery or alternator fails, the engine will continue to run.  Manifold pressure is the amount of vacuum created by the piston on it's intake stroke. Because a throttle creates a user controlled degree of blockage of the intake, the more the throttle is blocking the intake, the more vacuum will be created as the piston attempts to draw air into the engine. In short, it is the difference in pressure between the atmosphere and the intake manifold of the engine. A normally aspirated engine (i.e. not turbocharged or supercharged) can never have a higher manifold pressure than atmospheric pressure."
Helicopters,2rszky,rofl_pilot,2,Fri Jan 9 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Much thanks. Good explanation.  Also, where are the magnetos located specifically within the engine?"

Maybe once you're settled down with the basic stuff, give it a good read. It has accident reports and accounts of accidents that have killed some of the best pilots, and how to avoid doing the same yourself. Easily the best money you can spend on a training resource. Good luck!"

It is a 2 part book where the first half gives a private/student pilot level of explanation, then the second half is a CFI/ him as a test pilot explanation of all the topics in the first half. It is a great book and I highly recommend it."
Helicopters,2ronl0,kylehawk,3,Wed Jan 7 23:46:33 2015 UTC,"This is the relevant part of SFAR 73:   (5) No certificated flight instructor may provide instruction or conduct a flight review in a Robinson R-22 or R-44 unless that instructor --  ...  (ii) For the Robinson R-22, has had at least 200 flight hours in helicopters, at least 50 flight hours of which were in the Robinson R-22, or for the Robinson R-44, has had at least 200 flight hours in helicopters, 50 flight hours of which were in Robinson helicopters. Up to 25 flight hours of Robinson R-22 flight time may be credited toward the 50 hour requirement.   My interpretation is that you are golden from a legal standpoint. Build that turbine time! However, if you are planning on being employed by your flight school, it would probably be worth talking to them to see what they want."
Helicopters,2ronl0,Exalted_Leader_Morse,2,Thu Jan 8 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"To be honest, unless you know for sure you are going to get hired at your current school I would stick with the 44 or try to get 22 time.  Very few schools have an R66 for training.  Other schools are going to want you to teach in either the 22 or 44.    It is highly unlikely (but not unheard of) that anyone is going to hire you for a turbine job outside of a flight school with less than 1000 hours.  So from the day you start instructing to the day you have 1000-1500 hours its better if you fly in a 22 or 44.    Insurance (which rules the industry) is going to want to see over 100 hours in either the 22 or 44."

Get endorsed to instruct in the 22 & 44, but fly the 66 as much as you possibly can. That turbine time is invaluable, no matter how man hours you have. If you can, do everything in the 66, especially if you already have over 50 hrs in 22/44."

I know this because I worked for ULA and looked for a different job when I realized that I didn't agree with their ethics or lack there of. Guidance has had some problems as well.  I only know this because ULA took in some transfer students and they told stories, so..... not first hand but some info.  I know two CFII's that went through Leading Edge and they are two incredible guys, I don't know much about their program though.  KC Copters and St.louis Helicopters were both approved for their 141 recently and I know that KC Copters hired some great CFII's.  St. Louis Helicopters sounds like they have a great program.

Helicopters,2rfrxn,ALH403,3,Mon Jan 5 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"Canadian working pilot here.    First off, no it is by no means easy finding entry level work anywhere in Canada as a licensed 100 hour pilot.  Don't buy into the BS the schools will try to sell you.  You may consider yourself lucky if you do actually get a job on the ground, but the likelihood these days of that turning into a flying position is a bit of a pipe dream.  I finished my license in 2010 and only this year managed to get a job actually flying and I know I am one of the very few people that manage to make a career in this industry.    With the price of oil, most companies that thrive off the oil and gas industry - I imagine are going to be going through very tough times and will have even less interest in investing in bringing up low time pilots.    If you are concerned about working close to the city this industry probably isn't for you.  If you are truly passionate about flying helicopters you have to be willing to work in the bush for the majority, if not all of your career, unless you get on with someone like Helijet or Stars.     With the current market, I wouldn't really recommend anyone spend 50-60K to get their license right now.  I've heard the number of successful people that actually get flying in this industry is 10% of those who complete their commercial license and these days I'm sure it's going to be even fewer.    Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unless money isn't really an issue for you and you are ok with working up to 5 years on the ground for very poor pay and are an extremely determined individual, like motoraradio said, look at getting into a trade."

Although I won't totally write off the idea of getting my license I definitely think I will wait on it until I can afford to lose the money. The idea of spending 60k on something that isn't reliable isn't that plausible for a 21 year old bartender  haha. Thanks again for your time and insight! I will let you know if I decide to put my neck out and step foot in to the industry.

A lot of pilots on reddit are American, army/marine or international, and compared to how stuff works in Canada they may aswell be pilots from mars.   The way it works in canada, you pay 80-100k to get your license, then you work for easly 5-7 years at 10-15$ an hour putting up with all kinds of shit, then one magical day you'll hit 1500 hours and be able to start working on some better jobs.  It's a very long, expensive, arduous process, with very little 'glamour' sure flying is great!

And yes I live in one of those countries (Switzerland) where the career path (in an ideal scenario, aka if your training company retains you after you finish your license) is 100k->ground crew for a few years + ferry jobs + tourist flights->actual flying.  tl;dr helos be cool yo.

Helicopters,2r5bx4,zippyajohn,4,Sat Jan 3 06:32:28 2015 UTC,"This was last winter. At 0:57s one of the main rotor blades breaks at the hub, possibly because the pilot tried to make an aggressive cyclic input in a futile attempt to stop the slide, despite being at ground idle. You can hear and see the rotor flapping wildly out of control after that."
Helicopters,2r5bx4,_--_-___--,3,Sat Jan 3 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the rotor disk looks weird after it happens, but I still don't fully understand. Do you know if there is an incident report for this?"
Helicopters,2r5bx4,Suhweetusername,4,Sat Jan 3 01:30:19 2015 UTC,"They have a semi-rigid or rigid rotor system depending on your definition of the term. Either way, my understanding is that with one of those, you can absolutely NOT move the cyclic beyond very strict limitations when the machine is on the ground. At 100% you risk flipping the whole thing on it's back. And you are creating extreme moments in the mast and (due to the lack of hinges) in the blades. The blades get a lot of their stiffness from the centrifugal force due to their rotational speed. At ground idle, the blades are a lot less rigid.  Result is this:  http://www.retter.tv/cms_media/module_bi/152/76334_1_gallery_IMG_0007.jpg  http://www.freiepresse.de/DYNGAL/22020/264224_W606.jpg  ---_ is right - here's a close up of the snapped blade shows that it didn't hit anything, so that's not why it broke:   http://www.retter.tv/cms_media/module_bi/152/76332_1_gallery_IMG_0005.jpg  Image source: http://www.retter.tv/de/weitere-organisationen.html?ereig=-Schneemobil-stoppt-rutschenden-Rettungshubschrauber-&ereignis=22715  There is a full video of the event out there, the pilot landed, picked up again and landed in this spot before spooling down."

So something snaps, in this case the blade."
Helicopters,2r5bx4,achwas,1 point,Sat Jan 3 05:29:03 2015 UTC,"But the failure area is clearly outside of the green link rod. Surely if the cause of the failure was excessive cyclic input then the failure would be between link rod and mast head, since that is where the force goes?

Helicopters,2r5bx4,SeraphTwo,1 point,Tue Jan 6 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"it's aerodynamic forces that break the blade, not the force from the pitch input"

Helicopters,2r5bx4,SeraphTwo,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"Photos posted above show no impact damage to the blade or the sign post. Also the blade is clearly seen in the video breaking long before it gets anywhere near the sign post.

If there was a ground crew, why didn't they pick a proper, non-sloped landing spot?  B. Why didn't the pilot lift up again after the second slide started?  C. Why didn't the pilot communicate to the ground crew (even after the first slide) that the landing zone was no good and to either find an alternate like a parking lot?   Obviously a medevac helo is no good if it can't transport the patient."
Helicopters,2r5bx4,Suhweetusername,2,Tue Jan 6 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"It's a ski slope, none-sloped landing spots are hard to come by on those. It is also very hard to tell how much slope you are one when landing in overcast conditions on white snow.  This was attempt #2 to put it down, obviously it was a judgement error to pick this spot.  When the slide started he was already at ground idle (another judgement error), so it wasn't possible to lift off again."

Helicopters,2r0me9,brarna,4,Thu Jan 1 19:42:21 2015 UTC,The gun on the left is a GAU-21 .50 caliber machine gun. It shoots about 1100 rounds per minute so quite a bit faster than the ground side M2 .50 cal. On the right side is the GAU-17/A which is a 7.62 6 barreled electronically driven gatling gun.

Helicopters,2r0me9,judeckai,5,Sat Jan 3 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"On the left is the GAU-21, a .50 cal machine gun. Has a max effective of just under 2km and fires at 950-1100 rpm. Usually the crew engages with this weapon first, as it has the greatest range of the weapon systems.   On the right is the GAU-17, a 7.62mm, 6 barrel machine gun. Max effective of 1.1km, fires at 3000 rpm.   Those are rockets, not missiles, as they are not guided. there is a guidance section that can be added, called APKWS, but that is another discussion. Basically, the pilot points the aircraft at the target and pulls the trigger.   Normal target engagement leads with the .50, tip in for rockets, then the 7.62 on pulloff."

Helicopters,2qwaqr,Canaan-Aus,6,Wed Dec 31 06:17:29 2014 UTC,"Any helicopter can fly as far as maintenance and fuel on-board allows.  They do this with either auxiliary fuel tanks mounted either inside or outside the aircraft, and/or multiple fuel stops.  If you are talking non-stop flight, I flew a twin engine helicopter over 2600 miles nonstop.  I had 4 external fuel tanks installed which allowed me to extend my range.  What sounds ridiculous is that a person was medically evacuated such a large distance by helicopter.  It would have been much less  expensive to evac that person via a fixed wing airplane.  Most medically required transfers of patients over long distances are done in airplanes due to the cost factor along with the patient comfort.  Helicopters are used for ""short"" distance medical transfers/evacs and for rapid response times in critical patient situations, or where the area is remote enough that a land vehicle cannot get to the patient to evacuate."

I suppose the weight of the fuel would eventually be a problem but I understand what youre saying.  i completely agree with using a plane for longer distances. the speed, comfort and stops must outweigh any benefits of a helicopter in instances such as this. my guess is that they used a helicopter to/from the airports to a hospital and not the full leg, it makes no sense.

It had a placard next to the air stairs that said ""NM"".  It was used as an ampibious helicopter in Europe, until my company bought it and stripped it down for heli logging.  We thought it was an L model at first and asked about the placard, which appeared to be new.  Tomato/tomato or whatever.  I guess frankenstein is hard to classify.

Helicopters,2qpwlj,firesgood,2,Mon Dec 29 17:26:38 2014 UTC,I've heard that some of the companies in the canyon offer year round work as well as seasonal. What percentage of pilot are offered to stay on throughout the year? Is it limited to only pilots who have already been there a year? Wasn't sure if moving to the area would be necessary or if planning to only be there for a season was more realistic. Also was curious about the aeronautical knowledge quiz that they give their pilots. It's been a while since I was an active CFI and wasn't sure what I should study.
Helicopters,2qpwlj,firesgood,4,Mon Dec 29 17:55:21 2014 UTC,"I worked at Papillon almost a decade ago, so my info's a little dated... From what I remember, most of the hiring and training is done through the winter and spring, and then it's busy all through the summer.  It does tend to slow down over the winter, but I don't remember a big layoff.  I think enough people leave on their own after getting the hours they need that there's not really a need.  Not sure if that has changed.    Back then, Papillon had people working either five days a week or seven on/ seven off - I worked the latter and could jumpseat home for my week off.  For my week on, I rented a room out in Henderson (in which I had a futon and a lamp - livin' the dream for sure!)  Aeronautical knowledge? Heh... Uhhhhm, be a decent stick wiggler and be about to make basic radio calls.  It's all pre-planned and been done thousands of times before - there's very little in the job that tests airmanship.  I've seen people question whether the wx. was too bad because we could only see 15 miles (which feels like nothing when you're used to seeing 100 mi).  Flying wise, we had to show proficiency in straight in and 180 autos to a power recovery, stuck pedal, and hydraulics off landings.  I don't remember any real focus on aeronautical knowledge (of course I was coming straight off being a CFI, so I was steeped in the stuff at the time). Just review Pt. 91 and 135 and you'll be fine I think."

Prior to Papillon I had worked a season as a co-pilot for a fire/utility company and that experience on my resume was enough to get me an interview despite having just over half of the stated hours the company wanted. Interview flight went ok (good I guess, but that wasn't my perception at the time), and the second interview flight (first longline training flight) went even better."
Helicopters,2qpwlj,Cropgun,3,Tue Dec 30 07:07:32 2014 UTC,"2nd hand information for you:  My dad was the assistant Chief Pilot at Papillon's Grand Canyon base about, oh 20 years ago now.  As I type that I feel a bit dumb even bothering to respond and I'm sure some things have changed.  Man I'm getting old.  Anyway, for what its worth, the guys that had a few seasons in would typically get the full time slots, my old man would take us out with him to do utility work around the area.  It was pretty fun getting to have picnics on the tops of spires and other formations only accessible by helicopter.  Then I'd get to watch him long line from the lift area for a few hours, then we'd go home.    Unfortunately I'm sure things have changed in 20 years.  I know, I know.  Cool story bro."

Helicopters,2qpwlj,HeliNinja,3,Mon Dec 29 17:00:26 2014 UTC,I was curious when it comes to flying in Alaska if you had to travel for a traditional sit down interview or if they hire with a simple phone interview. Also do you have any idea what sort of aeronautical knowledge type questions are typically covered or quizzed in an interview?  Thanks
Helicopters,2qpwlj,HeliNinja,1 point,Mon Dec 29 17:42:37 2014 UTC,"There wasn't an interview before I got the invitation.  I knew someone who worked there already and he gave my resume to the CP with a good word.  They get hundreds of resumes so I think they like to go with recommendations.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't (saw some sketchy flying)  If you're invited up, the weeks you spend during training are your interview.  They look at not just your flying but ground instruction test scores and general attitude and demeanor.  Some guys washed out for bad flying, bad behavior, bad attitude, you name it.  The knowledge tests are the easy parts.  It's all flight school stuff but now you add on temp, torque and N1/G limitations.  If you can memorize you'll be fine.  Lemme know if you need more specific info."
Helicopters,2qpwlj,mrhelio,1 point,Tue Dec 30 06:32:22 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I've heard that many companies offer either 5/2 or 7/7, are there opportunities after the season had begun to switch from one to the other if needs change or are you pretty much stuck with a schedule? Like if a guy accepts the 7/7 but then decides that they don't want to bother going home every other week can they switch to the 5/2?"
Helicopters,2qpwlj,jackassalope,2,Tue Dec 30 15:40:51 2014 UTC,"I don't know of many rotations in Alaska because it's seasonal.  You basically work all the time with 1 or 2 days off a week.  The tour jobs are dependent upon the cruise ships so your day off is usually dictated by the number of ships in port.  After the season you are laid off so some guys find something else and others receive unemployment, go skiing and wait until next season.  It's worth it because Alaska flying is hard to beat.

Also I was curious what the interview process was like in the terms of being cold quizzed about aeronautical knowledge, and what sort of questions to expect. Its been a while since I taught as a CFII and I did a season as an R44 tour pilot, and I'm not sure how rusty I might be and wasn't sure what to study.  Lastly, because Temscos location in Alaska, do they perform a phone interview and hire before meeting pilots in person?

Remember that to get hired treat it like an interview from day one.  when you tour look for disorganization, look to see the hanger is clean, organized and people are friendly.  Ask about total load, if people are able to book easily or are fighting over aircraft (the answer is no at both schools as they both have big fleets)"
Helicopters,2qotb1,achemze,1 point,Mon Dec 29 07:58:17 2014 UTC,My CFI went to hillsboro for his private then came over to my current school for the rest of the commercial program. His personal evaluation was hillsboro was a good school but the weather can be dicey. Had to wait 3-4 months for a private check-ride and it still required SVFR with 900' ceilings.
Helicopters,2qotb1,HeliNinja,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:32:50 2014 UTC,"First, be cautious of people who say their school is the best or really good.  Most have only been to one.  It's like saying McDonald's is the best when you've never been to In 'n Out.  I went to 3 schools during my training, Hillsboro being the 2nd.  My experience was that it cranks out pilots with a bias towards foreign students.  My instructor was heavy on the controls, so much so that I failed a stage check because the autos felt completely foreign.  When I asked to change instructors they wouldn't let me.  Again, this was just my experience and I've known several guys that came through and were satisfied.  Every school will have disgruntled students.  Best advice is to visit each one and take a discovery flight.  There really isn't a ""best"" school because CFI's change so much that a school might be great one year and mediocre the next.  I left 2 schools before settling on a third because I wasn't satisfied with the instruction.  Your instructor will have the greatest impact on your experience.  Lastly, in my personal opinion, you can't to settle down anywhere in this industry, especially in the beginning.  You have to go where the jobs are and that usually means living somewhere you don't necessarily want to live.  In the last 5 years I've lived in 5 different states.  I'm finally getting to the point where I can start being selective on jobs."

The Cobra was also lighter and more nimble than the Apache.  The Apache has a better FCS and rotor system, which made it aerobatic, the 30mm sounds great and has a long reach, if they only went with side arm controllers in the Apache, it would be the best Attack helicopter for pilots.    Also, years, the Army Cobra was getting on in years, while the Apache is constantly refreshed with ""current"" tech.  The glass cockpit and MANPRINT tech is some of the best I have flown.

All you need to do is read the books and do lots of practice exams, online or with a paper Test-Prep book. Somebody who doesn't know the first thing about flying could pass them within 2 weeks.  When you get to your practical test however, there will be an oral examination. Chances are the DPE will find out what you really know. The written is just rote memorization, the practical test will show what you know and if you can apply it. Having a good instructor and taking some ground lessons with them will definitely help."

Sheperd Air is a good program for this. I primarily used the ASA training guides (paper pages) and blacked out all of the wrong answers to the questions while highlighting the correct ones. then using these to study I got the test discs and just took practice test after practice test, once you start consistently scoring mid 80's to low 90's you can safely assume that's what you'll score on the real deal. keep in mind you should still know the information on the test for the checkride, but we all know how much of the written test is really applicable to real world operations."

Helicopters,2pm6pf,Suhweetusername,8,Wed Dec 17 23:08:56 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much how it works. The machines are ""registered"" in the US, or Oz, or sometimes even NZ, but they are very far from home and aren't maintained IAW anything. I know for a fact that a lot of the machines are simply re-using the data plates or even just the tail number from whatever machine originally had the registration, while nobody really knows where the rest came from. The H369Cs (and C18 engines) that are most commonly used for this were once easy to come by as military surplus, although nowadays R44s with very questionable component times and TBOs are also making appearances out there. Also, nobody has any accident stats for all this, or if they do they aren't telling. The mechanics are often Philippino military drop outs that can't find a job anywhere else, parts are changed on condition (as in: on the condition that the mechanic feels like changing a part today), there typically is no paperwork for anything that happens with the machine unless your mechanic decides to keep track for his own records, a lot of the pilots are low timers who have never really learned how a helicopter operation is supposed to be run in the year 2014, and on top of all that one of the major operators is dodgier than fuck when it comes to paying you. A friend of mine had to change his name on Facebook after working for them.  You can get lucky and get a motivated mechanic and an understanding captain and have a good and relatively safe time while learning a lot about flying... Or you can get the complete opposite of all of that.  Disclaimer: never personally worked out there, but do know a lot of people very well that have."

If you're the engineer, and you found, say, a bit of metal in the gearbox. Maybe you know you don't have all the parts to fix it, but the ship isn't due back until the end of the month - do you ground the machine? Or do you disconnect the chip light, not mention anything, and hope she holds for another couple weeks? With the guys out there the answers to that would be split 50/50 at best."

The issue is partially that none of the flying out there can be verified because there is no paperwork other than whatever the person wrote in their logbook. The other issue is that they work with zero supervision - there are no annual training sessions or the like - which means that a lot of guys pick up some dangerous habits.

Unfortunately, as seems to be the case with most jobs, the only people who are willing to to put up with the crappier pay and/or living conditions are the new guys.  The job I'm currently in was similar, Hot & High confineds, mountain flying, extremely push customers and all manner of other nasty little things with the closest support being a good 2 hours flying time away. Sink or swim sorta situation!  You'd have to head back at the end of a contract and do a flight with a DE/CFI to keep your license current at the end of at least every second tour would you not?"
Helicopters,2plicq,jellenberg,6,Wed Dec 17 18:11:49 2014 UTC,"Helmets are used because of their safety factor, with less chance of head injury in a crash (largely). This is the reason you'll see them mainly used in high risk environments and with government contracts.  With this being said, safety wise a helmet makes more since in all facets of helicopter flying. Realistically though, you'll rarely see them used outside of the above environments.  Why? Headsets are largely lighter, more comfortable, cooler, and less restrictive. Of course there are exceptions to this, and this is where cost and research comes in.  If you're doing training in a turbine, then they are almost always larger, so being able to maneuver in the cockpit is not as bad. And weight is not near an issue. Then it just comes down to weight and comfort (leaving the before mentioned safety out).  If you're training in an R22 though, it is small so moving your head around can be a pain, they won't be air conditioned so it'll be hot, and weight is a major issue. If you can afford a top off the line feather weight helmet, it's not huge deal. But if your helmet weighs 10 pounds then that's almost 2 gallons of fuel, and half of your 20 minute reserve!  People do wear helmets to train in Robinsons, so it's not unheard-of. You'll just have to weigh the pros and cons of your specific situation.   My opinion is to just use your Bose headset, and worry about the helmet when the job dictates it.  Good luck with the new training and sorry for the long post!   Edit: Obviously not all helmets weight 10 pounds, and actually few do. Expect it to be closer to 5 pounds."
Helicopters,2plicq,jediforhire,9,Wed Dec 17 19:11:59 2014 UTC,If your helmet weighs ten pounds you need to take it back to the medieval castle you stole it from and buy a helicopter helmet.

Helicopters,2plicq,_--_-___--,3,Wed Dec 17 21:05:39 2014 UTC,Was using to 10 as an example of how much weight could affect flight planning in a small helicopter. Edited the original to clarify the obvious.
Helicopters,2plicq,jediforhire,2,Wed Dec 17 22:33:56 2014 UTC,Right now the plan is to do most of my training in the 300c with maybe some time building in a 22 later on
Helicopters,2plicq,Knight_Doppler,3,Wed Dec 17 19:33:23 2014 UTC,"I'd spend as much time in the 22 as possible if you're planning on making flying helicopters a career. As a civilian, your first job is most likely going to be as a flight instructor, and the 22 is the most popular trainer in the U.S. Getting checked out in the 44 is a good idea as well."
Helicopters,2plicq,BosoxH60,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:32:22 2014 UTC,"So far the plan is to do my private in the 300c, then when I get to my instrument I'll do as much as possible is the SIM before finishing it up in the 44. And if I need more Robinson time I'll use the 22 to meet those requirements."
Helicopters,2plicq,secretgspot,6,Wed Dec 17 21:47:17 2014 UTC,"I'd rethink that, if I were you.  You're going to need 50 hours in an R22 in order to get signed off on the SFAR in order to CFI in one.  I believe when you go to get the sign off in the 44, you only need 25 (+25 from the R22... again totaling 50).  Anyway...If you end up paying to build time just to be qualified (let's forget marketable for this conversation), then you're throwing money away, if you could have already gotten those hours through training that you already paid for.  Get it?  I'm a 1400 hour CFII (coming from the military), who can't get a job instructing, because I have 0 time in a Robinson, and it would cost me... 20+ thousand out of pocket to even be qualified to instruct in one.  My two cents"
Helicopters,2plicq,mbirth,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:08:21 2014 UTC,Thank you for the wisdom! Sounds like it's time to save money and get as much Robinson time as possible instead and then at least enough 300c time for my school to hire me maybe.
Helicopters,2plicq,HeliBif,7,Thu Dec 18 17:31:35 2014 UTC,"depends on the job, but just like with motorcycles, it's recomended all gear all the time.  You never know when you might crash.    It's a bit more problematic wearing full safety gear in Public/Tourist sector. Think about it, I am wearing full body suit and my passengers only get a headset... they start to worry.   If your job doesn't involve being an Air Taxi, you should wear full gear all the time."

Helicopters,2plicq,HeliBif,2,Thu Dec 18 00:25:02 2014 UTC,"From a safety standpoint? Helmet 100% all day, every day.  Having said that, there are any number of non-safety related reasons someone (not me) would chose a headset over a helmet. Comfort, space, appearance, helmets weird some passengers out...  A helmet is absolutely not overkill for training. But if you're 6'5"" and learning in an R22 there might not physically be room for it :P  If you go with a helmet I would suggest MSA Gallet or Alpha helmets. You could go a somewhat more affordable Gentex (and many people love theirs), but the Gallet and Alpha tend to be lighter, more comfortable, and better components.  Features? Dual visor, extra noise protection, inline volume control. I would recommend avoiding an mp3 or cell phone plug in, since the last thing you need as a pilot starting out is more distractions.  You can find used helmets too, which is maybe a better option for someone just starting out."
Helicopters,2plicq,HeliBif,2,Wed Dec 17 18:58:37 2014 UTC,Space probably won't be a huge concern for me as I'm 5`11 and plan to do my training in a 300c but will still probably see some 22 time. I was looking at the evo and hhc helmets on helicopterhelmets.com but I'll definitely look into your suggestions too!
Helicopters,2plicq,HeliBif,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:36:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you'll be fine in a 300 and a 22 most likely. I don't know anything about the helmet options you mention, but it all comes down to personal preference and budget."
Helicopters,2plicq,WDE117,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:55:00 2014 UTC,"Something's weird here...  Their ""evo"" is an MSA Gallet  Their ""hhc"" is just a Gentex  So they're either relabelling other companies helmets as their own (product info claims the Evo is made in USA, but MSA Gallet is a french manufacturer?), or have a legit ability to resell those products under a different name. The whole thing seems fishy to me, I dunno. Maybe someone else has experience buying from them?"

Helicopters,2plicq,Great_Dane89,1 point,Wed Dec 17 20:25:28 2014 UTC,"I mean, they could claim whatever they want, but that doesn't make it true. They very well could be better in those various regards, but then why would they be cheaper?  The only way to know is to search for independent reviews or to buy one yourself and run your own comparisons. This and a similar Reddit thread from Sept are the only 2 impartial results on the first page of my quick google search.  But here, look:  LH 250 HELMET with NVG Hardvisor and Interface plate - $2,145  EVO 252 with NVG Ready Visor Cover & Interface - $2,149  So, already their price claim is BS (unless those aren't equivalent models, I don't have the energy to start comparing specifics)  Personally the lack of info and industry feedback about these guys would make me reluctant to purchase from them. Gallet is a proven brand, and Merrit Apparel is a well reviewed retailer, which is why I went with them.  Your feelings and mileage may vary, of course."
Helicopters,2plicq,Schneiderman,1 point,Wed Dec 17 20:38:12 2014 UTC,They make parts like lenses on their website and they advertise that they're compatible with both the Evo and msa gallet. So my guess is that they rebranded/ improved the msa gallet maybe
Helicopters,2plicq,cowboy615,1 point,Wed Dec 17 20:59:03 2014 UTC,"Ok, so I have a few more questions since I'm new to this. What exactly is an interface? And what is a cep/cme kit? From what I've seen it's custom molded ear pieces. Do you put those I'm before the helmet goes on? And does sound actually transmit through those? Like does it have speakers built in for the radios?"
Helicopters,2plicq,Azhigher,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:32:36 2014 UTC,"I've never used NVG, so I don't honestly know what the interface refers to. My guess is you don't need it. Nor do you need the NVG capable outer shell.  CEP = custom ear plugs. And yes, you're basically right. They are repeat use earplugs that have their own mini speakers in them, wired to the helmet. You insert them first before donning the helmet. The people I've spoken to who use them tend to like them. Some versions are foam plugs, some are the custom fitted ones. CME = I dunno, off the top of my head. Custom molded earplugs?  My Gallet came with the ""hush kit"" which is basically just extra padding around the ear cups to deaden sound. They've packed in over the years so, while they still do a good job, I've also started using standard foam earplugs as well."
Helicopters,2pkvug,jduquenn,6,Wed Dec 17 14:50:58 2014 UTC,"Yes. Commitment (tdp, ldp) apply when flying multi-engine machines in PC1 and PC2 profiles.   TDP applies when the departure area no longer permits a safe landing, so you are committed to continue your take off, do a circuit and come back to land (or solve the issues before landing if it's not too urgent).  LDP is the point after which you can not go around with a single engine anymore.  In single engine machines it's easier. It fails, you land it. That's why the height/velocity diagram is so important. Be out of the dead man's curve and you might survive if there's a suitable place to land. If not... good luck.  Sorry for formatting/words, on mobile while vooping."

Helicopters,2pkvug,achemze,5,Fri Dec 19 03:32:07 2014 UTC,"If you mean the idea that there is a point of no return during approach, after which a go-around is no longer an option: Yes, sometimes. Depending on weight, power and shape of the landing area, you may find yourself unable to go around once you drop below the height of the obstacles in front of you, or once your airspeed drops below translation.   Also, when landing in blowing dust or snow, you might be committed to land once you switch to your final visual reference on short final, because there is nothing else you can see outside."

Helicopters,2pkvug,motorolaradio,2,Wed Dec 17 15:19:44 2014 UTC,"I have the impression that when it comes to fixed wings, commitment seems to be a bigger deal, no? (i'm no pilot). In both answers you gave me, it seems that a helicopter pilot only has to commit in certain situations. Not always, as a fixed wing pilot would."
Helicopters,2pkvug,microcat4,1 point,Wed Dec 17 16:06:28 2014 UTC,"As a fixed winged pilot, you ""commit"" when your wheels touch the ground. Even then it is still possible to open the throttle and go around- this is called a touch 'n' go. This is a very early concept as you use this as a student pilot to build landings without braking, coming to a full stop, taxiing, and doing a run up again. I guess a better concept of ""committing"" for fixed wing is when you no longer have enough runway to go around and have to either brake in time or run off the run way. This happens on very (we're talking 200-300 feet for the 172) short runways, when your speed falls below landing speed and you do not have enough time to pull up the flaps. During normal operations at most US airports you shouldn't have to go all in, you want your escape options open."
Helicopters,2pkvug,mrbubbles916,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:30:55 2014 UTC,"As a fixed wing guy I would say commitment is a much bigger deal in a helicopter. Airplanes like to fly so it is easy to stay in the air so long as you have an engine and fuel. Lose either of those and you are now committed.  Also as microcat stated, short field operations tend to force you to commit once the wheels hit the ground."
Helicopters,2pkvug,Torkin,1 point,Sun Dec 28 14:36:08 2014 UTC,So what is your interest in this topic if not a pilot? Not trying to be rude just trying to find the answer you need.
Helicopters,2pkvug,Torkin,1 point,Wed Dec 17 17:19:20 2014 UTC,"I'm going to Canada next year to start integrated CPL-H. I'm just being curious, i'm not looking for a specific answer. The other day I was watching this tv program called ""The worst place to be a pilot"" or something like that. The question of this topic came up after that. (The whole program was basically about fixed wing pilots struggling to land in tiny mountain airstrips in Indonesia)."
Helicopters,2pkvug,desiderata2012,2,Wed Dec 17 18:20:34 2014 UTC,I would refer back to b3nighted's answer. LDP and TDP are what we use in the multi engine world though what those numbers are depend on aircraft and profile. I don't fly fixed wing but I would imagine that helicopter numbers are much tighter. 20 kts/50' is LDP for most operations I fly.

Helicopters,2pkvug,Tunne,1 point,Wed Dec 17 18:21:46 2014 UTC,"Another thing to consider is loss of wind effect. If you are coming into a confined area ( such as a cutout of trees) with a 15kias headwind, and once you drop below the tree line it all disappears, in the right conditions you have ""committed"" because you don't have the power available to waive off ( as a result of losing that head wind )"
Helicopters,2pkvug,Cropgun,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:56:08 2014 UTC,"when you train, yes.   You want to land and approach the spot that you've picked while doing High Recon.  Then you do Low Recon to double check suitability of your landing spot and then you go for it.   Also, when instructor tells you to land on the Numbers,  Land on the numbers.  Not before, not after.    Usually I focus on just before the number, allowing me about 2-3 meter roll if I need to.   Then I maneuver myself to that spot.  After a while you learn an angle that gets you to the right location"
Helicopters,2pkvug,achemze,0,Wed Dec 17 20:45:15 2014 UTC,"Ok, that's not what OP is talking about. It's about the capability (or lack of) to perform a safe landing / continued climb in case a single engine failure. The subject is called performance and as far as I remember from my FAA days, it's not that commonly discussed over there. Probably since it really isn't that big of a concern until you fly twins. You are always committed with single engine.  a lot of info available, but here's a quick read and some important definitions"

Helicopters,2phq37,iamkokonutz,4,Tue Dec 16 19:04:04 2014 UTC,Why would you decide to use this technique rather than winch down to the casualty?
Helicopters,2phq37,tbone752,8,Tue Dec 16 23:04:36 2014 UTC,"Winch operations require the additional weight of the winch system and the addition of a winch operator. At the altitudes where Air-Glaciers/Air Zermatt work, they don't have the power margin to be able to do that. As a result, they frequently will fly out and establish a base-camp where they will drop off un-needed gear and personnel prior to performing a static-line rescue. If you notice in this video, they go as far as removing the pilot-side door.   I have flown with these guys and their expertise is unreal."
Helicopters,2phq37,achwas,5,Wed Dec 17 02:18:18 2014 UTC,"The door isn't removed to save weight, it is so you can see better. This AS350 does have a vertical reference window in the floor that can be used even with the door installed, but you get a much better perspective through it if you can stick your head out just a little further. And the door gets in the way of that."
Helicopters,2phq37,HeliBif,5,Wed Dec 17 05:43:08 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming you're referring to Longlining the rescuer vs. winching down from the cabin?  Consider that this helicopter is likely not a dedicated rescue ship, and neither are many of the helicopters that participate in rescue operations, therefore a winch (which is essentially a fixed part of the airframe) would present unnecessary weight and bulk for any non-rescue operations.   Also, consider that these light/intermediate ships (206, 206L, 407, AS350) are not exactly heavy lifting machines so once you throw on a pilot, spotter, 1-2 rescuers, their gear, fuel, etc and take the machine up to altitude to an Out of Ground Effect hover, that doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for a winch (which probably weighs a few hundred lbs), cable, winch operator, and then the victim/payload.   TL;DR - Longlining is more efficient than a winch for an aircraft which is not dedicated to a rescue role."
Helicopters,2phq37,HeliBif,4,Wed Dec 17 02:21:09 2014 UTC,"Just thought of something else. I'm not sure you would conduct winch operations on a single engine aircraft anyway. There'd be no emergency release in the event of an engine failure. Worst case scenario with the longline, is in the event of an engine failure and autorotation the pilot can do a high enough flare to get the rescuer to ground, punch the line off at the belly, and still have a decent chance to make a half-decent auto from what's essentially a very high hover.   Source: a very experienced rescue pilot at a previous employer actually went through this. The man is a fucking legend.   Edit: As per u/achwas, winches do have a cable cutter, so I stand corrected on this point."
Helicopters,2phq37,achwas,3,Wed Dec 17 02:30:31 2014 UTC,Those winches do have a built in cable cutter. They have to have a way to get rid of the cable in case the bottom end gets snagged somewhere.

Helicopters,2phq37,HeliBif,2,Wed Dec 17 03:43:22 2014 UTC,"Basically the situation I described as above. He was conducting a LL rescue in a 206L (unsure of specific model). Experienced an engine failure (or some emergency requiring an auto) with 2 parks rescue personnel on the line. Auto'd with men on the longline to a spot where he was able to flair at long line height, punch the line off once the rescuers hit the dirt, then nose over to build up enough speed to get another flair and land the machine. I don't know what level of damage was sustained by the aircraft, but I do know both the pilot and that machine were still flying when I worked there (incident happened in the 70's or 80's if I recall correctly).  The pilot himself didn't talk to much about his experiences, and the story was relayed to me by another pilot so I apologize I can't provide proof."

Helicopters,2phgjc,Av619,1 point,Sat Dec 20 03:02:14 2014 UTC,I've never heard of the DRE headset or anything about them.  I started my training with a basic David Clark with no noise cancelling and had no problems for the 200 hours of training.  When I started instructing I bought a noise cancelling David Clark and rarely turned on the noise cancelling feature because the heli sounded too quiet. I flew with that headset for probably 700 more hours.  Now I have the Bose A20 and the only reason I bought that was I did a ferry flight across the US and wanted to listen to music.  For me I wish I had bought the Bose from the start. A grand is a lot of cash but a small price in the grand scheme of things.    The only thing that I liked about the David Clark headsets better than the Bose is the passive noise cancelling. When the batteries die in the Bose it can be a pain to hear especially if the person you are with has active noise cancelling because then the radio volume will more than likely be low.
Helicopters,2phgjc,wheresmycoozy,1 point,Wed Dec 17 06:44:48 2014 UTC,"Never heard of the DRE.    I've tried all the popular options.  Bose, Lightspeed, DC, etc...  My recommendation is to pick up a basic David Clark headset.  Just stick with your basic passive attenuation model.  You can even try to find a decent used one.  Get some nice gel ear seals and the DC head pad. This will save you a decent amount of money at the start of your training.  It will also be super comfortable.  I used to wear this same set up for 12-16 hours at a time, day after day, without issue.  Also consider where you want to go with your career.  What kind of job do you want to end up at?  Because certain jobs call for certain headwear.  Many jobs will require a helmet.  And you obviously can't wear a headset and a helmet at the same time, and then you have a 1k headset collecting dust.  A note on ANR since it will inevitably come up.  ANR has its place.  And I don't feel that place is in the cockpit with a working helicopter pilot.  Personal opinion.  They're really great for fixed wing pilots (which do not forget is who the headset was designed for, most manufacturers slap a helicopter plug on a headset as an afterthought). They work pretty good in sealed helicopter cockpits too, which also make them a good option for PAX or tour operations.  Where they really fall behind is on the head of a working helicopter pilot.  ANR is garbage if you're moving around a lot and have your head out the door on a regular basis.  One of the worst days of flying I have ever had was 14hrs in a Bose headset.  YMMV."
Helicopters,2peol0,TayLordVoldemort,3,Mon Dec 15 22:59:05 2014 UTC,"Ive gone to school at both Epic Helicopters and currently go to Sky helicopters. Both companies are good companies. School wise I think sky is the better option. For Epic Helicopters it was nice to do my PPL because they had the airport right there and I thought it would make training easier and cost less money because you dont have to fly to another airport. In some respects that was nice but also I didnt have the experience of going to multiple different airports like you would at Sky. I don't have anything against Epic but they were much more commercially oriented. They have 2 R-22's (1 of which was either in maintenance or needed an overhaul), 1 R-44 (not sure if they aquired another) and 2 R-66's last I saw. Tours were a big thing for Epic and they have operations out of KFTW (Meacham) and Addison (KADS). The tower at Meacham is very helpful with training and understanding you are a new pilot. Meacham is almost solely a private airport with one fixwing school and lots of corporate jets that fly in and out. Sky Helicopters has been great so far. Many more instructors (6+) with all having CFII I think. I am currently doing my IR through CFII as Sky. They have quite a bit of commercial ops out of the heliport as well. They have news contracts for local news stations as well as photo work and survey along with other things as well. Their Chief pilot also is a DPE for the FAA so going up for a check ride is not as intimidating. If you would like you are welcome to PM me and i can answer any questions you might have further.  Total cost is usally around 75k for PPL-IR-CPL-CFI-CFII. I was able to do my PPL in 47 Hours which is well below the national average so I was able to save some money there. So far I am on course to do my check ride for my IR in January with almost the exact amount of hours needed. Its all about studying the books so when you go up in the air everything knowledge based is easy and you dont have to add the extra mental workload on top of learning how to fly.

Next day I would pick him up at 4:30am and we would be the first flight out as Tower becomes operational to try everything we talked about the night before.

First, call flight schools in Canada and the U.S. and talk to their people. Have these questions prepared and write what they have to say down. Talk to an instructor if you can. Also, there is nothing stopping you from calling major helicopter companies which are just a Google search away! All it takes is a little bit of research and you'll talk to all sorts of people who will answer your question. I've found that pilots like to talk to young aspiring pilots like yourself.  The reason I say to call them is, frankly, because no one here is going to answer your questions. You're asking way too much all at once, and you seem to have not done much of your own research.

After about 2 years you will have enough hours to get a job that pays more around 36,000 per year which you can stick with for another 2 years before moving on to a job that pays between 48,000 and 60,000. The only jobs that pay more than that are typically difficult or dangerous oil or utility work in remote areas. The highest paying job I've ever seen was for 141,000 but it was doing oil rig work off the coast of Somalia in Africa because of the high danger."

This is some good engineering :)  Also, in the above video the pilot claims his hydraulics were the problem. I didn't think Robinson helicopters used hydraulics, I think I even read that part of why they are so sensitive is because the swashplate is directly linked to the cyclic with linkages.

Helicopters,2p7437,zoso135,11,Sat Dec 13 23:40:35 2014 UTC,"I would guess the transmission failed. The chance of both engines failing at the same time are slim. Unless they ran out of fuel. If the rotor disintegrated at 6,000 feet, they would be dead. My guess is that it oversped in the auto."
Helicopters,2p7437,miATC,0,Sat Dec 13 23:04:50 2014 UTC,"I can't understand why this article says the cause is unknown and then says the ""engine died."" There are definitely two engines and it can fly with just one of one breaks.   Shaft break or gearbox failure is much more likely. My guess is shaft break. The bang was it breaking and the noise after was the rotating shaft banging around in its sleeve.   Engines may have popped against overspeed due to loss of load."

Helicopters,2p7437,Ozstriker,1 point,Sat Dec 13 22:17:23 2014 UTC,Certainly is unusual. From my understanding though (10 years fixing Blackhawks) you would only ever overspeed the rotor on auto if the rigging was waaaay out which is unlikely. Maybe the turbine let go and threw some teeth through the blade?
Helicopters,2p7437,Scissorgrass,2,Sat Dec 13 22:22:10 2014 UTC,"No, pilotage can also exacerbate rotor speed (i.e. high true airspeed at the onset of the autorotation, high gross weight, air density(thin air=faster Nr)).  Students attempt to overspeed rotors on us at Rucker consistently.  We check it by either applying abrupt forward cyclic or increasing the collective just a bit."
Helicopters,2p7437,SeafoodGumbo,11,Sun Dec 14 01:03:32 2014 UTC,"Blackhawks have low inertia rotor blades, it is very easy to either underspeed and/or overspeed during an auto, especially if maneuvering to a forced landing area, they also drop like a slightly greased bowling ball in an auto if loaded which would make over speeding much easier.  A delayed reaction to a single engine failure could cause a large underspeed/droop at any of either or combined, higher gross weights/high speed flight/high altitude occurred, which could cause partial blade structural failure and damaged but still flyable rotor system/airframe.  Dual engine failure is a very, very, very small possibility, but if there is any delay in lowering the collective the droop could become so severe that recovery is impossible due to blade structural failure.  Look up dihedral roll, I think in one of R. W. Prouty's aerodynamics books.  Source:  Retired military test pilot/Instructor pilot and civilian trained experimental helicopter test pilot."
Helicopters,2p7437,Ozstriker,1 point,Sun Dec 14 04:38:32 2014 UTC,Interesting. Could you explain further how the low rotor rpm could cause blade structural damage. I remember doing vibes with pilots where they would just push collective to the floor then tell me whether I need to adjust it up or down.
Helicopters,2p7437,SeafoodGumbo,4,Sun Dec 14 09:16:54 2014 UTC,"Modern composite rotor blades, and even the older ones get structural strength at the designed normal operating range for the airframe they are designed for.  Once the RPM has decayed below a certain threshold, it cannot be regained unless the engine is powering it.  If a collective load is placed on the low RPM rotor system the blades will cone/flex.  Once the coning goes beyond the designed structural bend/load limit, the flexing will become cracking/breaking, de-lamination and rotor blade failure."
Helicopters,2p7437,popcorntopping,1 point,Sun Dec 14 09:31:16 2014 UTC,That is plausible. A departed turbine wheel would make short work of a main rotor blade.

Helicopters,2p7437,coriolinus,1 point,Sun Dec 14 12:40:47 2014 UTC,"Sure, those scenarios make sense. I guess my reaction stems from the fact that every unit I have ever been in since flight school has required at least a crew chief all flights."

A broad answer to your question is that no, we do not need to be certified to work on different aircraft like a pilot needs different type certifications to fly different aircraft. We can work most any aircraft we have the maintenance data to work on, depending on mode of operations. Most 135 operators have it written into their GMM that maintenance events must be completed at a certified repair station that has been audited by the operator and most 121 operators (airlines for all intensive purposes) require that maintenance personnel be employed by the air carrier.

Helicopters,2osde6,Suhweetusername,11,Wed Dec 10 13:05:51 2014 UTC,"I will agree, that unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming and will become increasingly prominent in the aviation industry. I would also agree that they will become a standard in some fields of aviation/rotorcraft. But suggesting that anytime in the near future, helicopters will become obsolete, in lieu of quad-copters? Come on. Do you know what helicopters do? You know they don't just carry cameras around right?   No pilot here is going to adjust or change their career because small, multi engine fixed pitched rotor remote control helicopters may eventually dominate the very small portion of our industry that is helicopter cinematography.   Most of the men and women in this sub are pilots or aspiring pilots. We are all well aware of the increasing utilization of UAVs and what that could mean for our career eventually. The most threatening to helicopter pilots, on any sort of realistic timeline, would probably be drone helicopters. Full-sized, turbine engine, unmanned rotorcraft. However, these type of drones still remain a distant thought when it comes to full blown or even semi-market dominance. How do I know? I'm in the industry. And I know some stuff about helicopters. Like most folks here.   This is generally a forum for pilots, aspiring pilots, and enthusiasts. It would appear, to me anyway, that a few quad-copter enthusiasts got excited and wanted to talk about this today. That's fine. A discussion about two things that are almost similar and share a small functionality, is always welcome and fun. But there is no need for more than one thread, especially within a few hours of each other.   Which brings me to my point. A thread every once and a while about quad-copters/multi-copters/RC copters that one Persian guy always tries to pressure you into buying at the mall, is great. But if you wanted to get excited about those things and talk about ""oh wow multi-copters are the future"" and ""your job will be obsolete soon"" and ""A pilot is akin to most low level service positions,"" well you can fuck right off. /r/Multicopter is right over there. If you want to talk about fuckin jet fuel, big ass engines, 8 foot diameter space age alloy tail rotor so finely aerodynamically engineered to slice through the air you swear it could give you a buzzcut without so much as leaving a scrape on your pretty head, then by all means; welcome to /r/Helicopters   Sorry but I don't give a shit about multi-copters. I know a lot of people do, and like I said it's totally cool to talk about em a little bit. Hell, a good friend of mine films racing and whatnot with thousands an thousands of dollars worth of quad-copters and RED cameras. He's badass at flying that thing and a hell of a videographer. But it's not my thing and in my opinion not real aviation. I see full size drones, not multi-copters, as a potential career threat and I think those small remote control aircraft controlled by untrained and unlicensed individuals are hazardous to aircraft with actual souls on board.

In fact, I contend that a properly programmed computer will perform malfunction analysis and EPs faster and more accurately than a human pilot, every time.   What are emergency procedures, exactly? They're pre-thought out sequences of actions designed to minimize further risk in the event something goes wrong. That is exactly the kind of thing computers are best at. The software required for a drone to see and avoid some sport pilot without a radio is about 10,000 times more complex than the code required to ensure that the limits are always observed and the emergency procedures are always followed."
Helicopters,2osde6,coriolinus,2,Wed Dec 10 07:18:22 2014 UTC,"What are emergency procedures, exactly?   They are steps to take when an emergency is detected. How does the computer system detect the emergencies? I don't doubt that if you program the computer the steps to take, it can perform them in the right order, every time, without hesitation. I question the ability for the computer to determine when it is in an emergency.  Sure, some are easy, the engine stopped producing power. There are gauges that measure that already, and the computer would be able to constantly monitor that gauge and react accordingly.  What about loss of tail rotor effectiveness? How does the computer determine which direction the wind is coming from? If it can't determine the wind direction, then how can it land into the wind? Can it predict the mechanical turbulence that will happen when trying to land to a hospital rooftop pad? Does it know how to determine which way to land to be into the wind when there is no reporting station at the landing site? What if its an improved landing zone out in the mountains? Can it identify the dry grass that will catch on fire if it lands there? There are so many different things that the computer would need separate sensors for, that all your payload would be lost in sensors and processors for identifying the hazards.  Not to mention the possibility of a computer fault. FADEC (full authority digital engine control) turbine controllers are not exactly fault-proof. If they can't make something as simple as a FADEC not have failures, then how can they do it with something as complicated as fully automated flight?"
Helicopters,2osde6,tarantulae,2,Wed Dec 10 19:04:31 2014 UTC,"Determining wind direction and speed could be a zero-mass increase by comparing attitude/trim/airspeed to GPS ground speed, or you could do it substantially more accurately by incorporating little 1 kg sensors like the Apache has. Loss of tail rotor effectiveness is pretty easy: if you've got uncommanded yaw at or near a hover, particularly when facing downwind, execute the EP. There's no particular need to predict mechanical turbulence if your control inputs are fast enough to react to it as it happens. I've landed in a lot of open fields and never had to worry about grass fires; engines are mounted high precisely to avoid that sort of complication. Computer faults do happen. The space shuttle was essentially entirely computer-controlled; even the manually-piloted bits depended on computer guidance. They controlled for faults by having five computers running the same programs and voting. A ruggedized avionics computer might weigh what, 8 kg? Five of them weigh about half as much as one of the pilots you're replacing.   Let's talk about some real life emergency procedures I've executed. Torque split: detected by hearing a change in engine noise, noticing anomalous torque readings on the instrument panel. That would be pretty easy for a computer to notice. Main transmission chip light: the master caution and a little light came on. These are absolutely trivial for a computer to notice without adding any weight at all. What sort of EP do you envision which requires inputs other than these?   Further, how much do you imagine a sensor weighs? A heavy HH-60 with full fuel, at high altitude, with full patient and crew load, still has a good 2000 lbs of payload capacity; I literally can't imagine what sort of sensor suite would eat that all up."
Helicopters,2osde6,coriolinus,2,Wed Dec 10 19:56:50 2014 UTC,"Changing the CG would effect the attitude in a given flight condition (such as a hover). How would it know the difference between having a more forward CG or a 1-2 kt headwind?  LTE can happen outside of hovers too. Particularly right hand turns in a slow orbit from a headwind as that puts the wind through all 3 critical LTE angles without enough forward speed for the vertical fin to help.  Fast control inputs can cause increased wear on the rotorhead. In significant turbulence its often better to fly via attitude and minimize abrupt control inputs. Can the computer tell the difference?  Turbine engines generally are mounted high. What about piston helicopters? Surely if this will help bring the costs down so much, you'd want to take that savings to the helicopters with the cheapest operating costs.  You think an avionics computer could be had for 8kg? I don't think even a miniature HTPC could be had for that kind of weight. Much less 5 processors all running on separate systems to prevent failures. Also, all that certified electronics are expensive to replace if even one machine went down. Look at the price of certified GPS systems as an example.  What EPs might the computer miss? Fuel leak. It can't smell or see the fuel leaking out (or do you think there will be dedicated cameras at every possible point fuel could leak out of?). Maybe it would detect the more than calculated fuel consumption. Or would it continue trucking along until its reserves were hit, and then realize too late that it doesn't have the fuel to land, forcing an autorotation.  Speaking of which, I do wonder how well a computer could perform an autorotation over an area. Most flight databases have terrain elevation. Do you envision cameras and processing which is good enough to determine a good landing spot, and make the landing to it? What if you are over all forest, and there is no clear landing spot? Will the computer determine to autorotate to the tops of the trees and settle into them? How does it pick which part of the trees to go into? How do you envision the computer seeing landing zones that aren't ILS style landings? I don't think that video recognition processing is to the point that a computer can dynamically determine and land to a spot.  Here's another one I think a computer will have a terrible time with. Electrical fire. I'd imagine its about as devastating as the pilot having a brain aneurysm. I guess land ASAP, and hope you don't lose control/access to something that is required for that landing on the way.  Here's another one. Hydraulic failure. Would the computer notice slowly increasing control forces? Or would it merely command the servo/motor to move the control to the proper place? Speaking of that, what about a motor/servo failure? Wouldn't it need redundant control systems in case one of the control servos failed? Pilots take yearly medicals to try to help rule out the chances of a physical pilot failure at the controls. Would the computer systems require regular inspections on top of the aircraft? Doesn't that extra maintenance eat into your lower operating cost (the benefit of being a drone?)?  How much do I imagine a sensor weighs? Well, honestly, anything that pulls from the instruments a pilot already has access to would be just the wiring. Not too bad. Plus the computer systems. Plus a bigger battery to provide enough battery standby time for the computer to land with in case of alternator failure. Cameras that are high enough resolution to do things like see wires, or identify terrain from 500-1000' would be reasonably heavy. Not to mention the gyro systems required to get a useable image out of those cameras. Servos to move all the controls.  I could see drone helicopters best used in HEMS where pilots tend to make terrible decisions trying to save a life. Unfortunately, many HEMS operators don't have a lot of available payload, some even have strict pilot weight limits in order to accommodate all the extra medical equipment/crew on board. I could easily see a drone system with all its servos, computers, backup batteries, cameras, gyro stabilization systems, and other miscellaneous systems going well beyond the 220lb limit some companies place on their pilots."
Helicopters,2osde6,tarantulae,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:47:44 2014 UTC,"a computer could be programed to react to rote EPs faster and more accurately than a person yes. but the EPs are not the whole procedure. they are simply used for people as a guideline, something to prevent panic from freezing the pilot into inaction.  the actual actions during an emergency are infinite. as are the number of things that can go wrong. many, indeed most EPs end with  a decision for the pilot. and the law specifically frees the pilot to do anything they think will work during an emergency. this is because no one can predict ahead of time what might go wrong, or how to recover. computers can only be programed ahead of time, they can not think."

Helicopters,2osde6,Forlarren,2,Wed Dec 10 06:06:54 2014 UTC,"Multi-rotor aircraft often are shared power transmissions due to weight issues. Much of helicopter use is not simply filming, but actual lifting of weight. If you scale up a multirotor drone to a size that can lift something in the neighborhood of 1 ton (2000 lbs) then you would use up most of that extra payload for lifting the extra motors and transmissions for each rotor to be independent."
Helicopters,2osde6,tarantulae,2,Wed Dec 10 18:55:54 2014 UTC,"first of all, multi rotor designs are absolutely a bad idea, and will never be permitted for manned flight, at least not commercially. for one, multiple rotors increases (exponentially) the rate of failure, and provides no power off flight mode. so while a design can be made that could make a safe emergency landing minus one rotor, it would be less reliable than a single rotor design simply because the number of failure points(motors) is many times higher. and a multi copter cant not autorotate.  as for computers that can drive cars, they can ONLY navigate roads with embedded guidance (similar to radio navaids) and they can only anticipate and react to emergencies they have been programed to anticipate. which means the programmer has to anticipate every possible scenario and its proper reaction. the problem being, computers are VERY literal, they simply can not think so they can not react to an unforeseen emergency. for example what does the computer do when it is suddenly cut off from its controls, say as an example i can recall an airplane's rudder cables fail. control is no longer possible, but a human can rapidly learn to use the doors as a substitute. these things happen.   simply put emergencies in the air are so many million of times more complicated than ground car emergencies that i will never be comfortable with aircraft that don't at least have a pilot managing the system and able to take over when the computer cant deal."

Most of the stuff people are doing with them would be done better by a human in a helicopter, a camera on a jib, or just by standing on a damn ladder. If the customer is paying less for footage from a drone than footage taken by helicopter they are not getting a professional, they're getting a hobbyist trying to offset the cost of their hobby, and the results will reflect that. Most people doing aerial photo/video with drones have no idea what they're doing. And the customers who are paying hobbyists $100 for a cd filled with low-quality, fisheye, tilted-horizon pictures were never going to pay for real aerial photography anyway so it isn't cutting into my business."

That's enough payload for a Red that's also similarly priced. Directors could rent one just as easily as renting the camera and you would have access to it the entire time you are filming.  If you need a huge number of flying shots you can have some dude in a van do all the work over a couple of weeks for the same price as renting a real helicopter for a day.

Helicopters,2osde6,Forlarren,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:36:47 2014 UTC,"I still don't see how it's a threat to real helicopter flying jobs. Not now, and I would be surprised if it is an issue in 20 or 30 years.   Picture this...  customers want to go to a mountain top where there is a tower and a generator station to do some work. The customers also want some gear slung down the mountain on a long line. On the way, the customer decides they want to have a look at some other things in the area and tells the pilot. The pilot considers his fuel and the weather where they need to go and makes a decision. After this unplanned change to the flight plan, he drops the customers at the top of the mountain. He gets out and connects his long line, sets up the load (the customers don't know anything about setting up a proper sling load) and takes off with the load down to the staging area. After this, the pilot has to land at a make-shift fuel cache that was arranged prior and fuel up the helicopter before taking off again because he had to be light on fuel to accomplish moving the sling load (he fuels using an electric pump he carries with him and fuels out of a drum that is about 500 pounds and has to be propped upright and sampled/checked for fuel quality before being used). Once fueled up, he returns to the mountain top, but the weather is marginal. He comes into the pad anyway, but luckily misses a wire that he didn't see coming down from the tower. All is well, and landed safely. The guys take too long at the tower and it's getting close to the end of the day, we're running out of daylight. The pilot has to make sure the customers are aware of the amount of time, with the weather in consideration, it will take to get them back before the sun goes down. The customers push it to the very last minute and the pilot manages to get them back safely....    I could add so many more factors to this and it would still be a typical day in the life of a helicopter pilot. This is not at all an uncommon set of situations. Please tell me how you think an unmanned drone could come anywhere close to accomplishing that anytime in the near future."

Helicopters,2op8y4,amnhanley,5,Tue Dec 9 00:10:38 2014 UTC,"You need to join the military if at all possible.  Financially speaking, nothing else comes close.  However, you don't necessarily need to join as a pilot.  As a matter of fact, I'd recommend enlisting in a support capacity.  Join any branch as a mechanic.  Get your A&P certs knocked out before you get out in 4 years.  Then find a post 9/11 CC with an aviation degree program.  All of your training will be payed for and you will receive E5 BAH the entire time you are in school(about 1300 a month on average)  this plus Pell Grants is plenty for a single guy to live on comfortably while in school. In 5-6 years time you will now be a certified A&P mechanic, commercial pilot, and flight instructor with no debt and invaluable life experience as a veteran and preferential hiring status.  Compare that to 1 year of flight school as a commercial pilot/Flight instructor with no A&P cert, no veteran status, no VA benefits, and about 86K in debt.    Alternatively, you could go to flight school street to seat with the army and fly cool helicopters right out of the gate while incurring no debt.  but you incur something like a 10 year service commitment and honestly you won't have a whole lot of flight hours when you get out.  You will most likely get more hours in 4 years as a civilian pilot than 10 as a military aviator.  Thus at the 10 year mark you will likely be more employable as a civilian than an ex military aviator.  in my opinion anyway."

Airframe and Powerplant.  it's a fancy term for mechanic license.  during the early and mid stages of your career it can give you a huge leg up on the competition in terms of being hired.  if you can fix it and fly it you are far more valuable than someone who can fly it and break it."

Helicopters,2ohu42,prometheus5500,1 point,Sun Dec 7 16:35:10 2014 UTC,"Well, technically, a ""plane"" is a flat surface, and ""planing"" (like a boat) is basically what a wing does in the air. Although the ""planes"" on a helicopter rotate, and a fixed wing is just that, fixed, does not change the fact that both machines ""plane"" through the air in order to fly. The rotor-craft spin their plane to begin planing, and a fixed wing moves forward until the wing can begin planing.    Makes some sense... but I'm also not about to start calling a helicopter a plane, nor say that airplanes ""plane"" in order to fly."

Looks like LTE turned into loss of control and hit a bus.   After an uneventful go around, the pilot made a second approach but eventually decided to perform another go around due to difficulties in stabilising the helicopter. As he was making a turn to the right, the helicopter started a spin in a clockwise direction. Whilst the helicopter was spinning, it began to lose altitude and drifted in a northerly direction until it impacted the windscreen of a coach parked in the parking lot adjacent to Sung Wong Toi Road. At the time of the accident, one person was working inside the coach. There was no post-impact fire but the aircraft was damaged. The pilot, the helicopter passenger and the person inside the coach sustained minor injuries.    ...   The investigation concluded the cause of the accident was that the helicopter during a downwind approach experienced a Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE) that resulted in the aircraft spinning to the right during a low airspeed tight turn to the right. This subsequently led to the total Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness due to a Vortex Ring State developing on the tail rotor disc."

It will make the helicopter ""float"" more and give you that extra second to look around in an emergency. Everybody I have taught coming from the Robby just slams that collective down and then we're suddenly rushing towards the ground in the Ranger even though we don't really need to be... Thanks for sharing the video! Which airport is that? Looks familiar."
Helicopters,2oer50,specialgray,3,Sat Dec 6 01:49:34 2014 UTC,"The inputs on the collective, pedals, and cyclic all happen simultaneously. I just verbalize them in that order because I can't say it all at once. The amount of aft cyclic depends on airspeed. More airspeed, more aft cyclic."
Helicopters,2oer50,Cropgun,1 point,Sat Dec 6 02:48:32 2014 UTC,Aft cyclic should always initate an autorotation.
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,3,Sat Dec 6 03:53:47 2014 UTC,"Only 75 hrs robbie time, and I've read it is somewhat different in other types, but in the R22 the rotors are very low inertia the RRPM will drop like a stone if you don't drop collective ASAP."
Helicopters,2oer50,CrashSlow,3,Sat Dec 6 02:13:27 2014 UTC,And what do you suppose will happen to the rotor RPM when you put in aft cyclic?
Helicopters,2oer50,fyrflier,2,Sat Dec 6 03:57:14 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm only a student, and this is coming from reading the internet, not from my instructor.  From what I've seen, and I think Pete Gillies is the preacher on this, aft cyclic should be first, especially at cruise speed. Entering an auto at 70kt may not be so bad, but at cruise speed with a no warnings engine failure, aft cyclic will save your life. If you're cruising at 100kt and the engine just dies, lowering the collective only will get you killed. You've got to get the helicopter into an attitude to start that auto. At a 100kt attitude you're not going to get enough air through the rotor to maintain rpm.  In practice autos, entering at 70kt, I would think both are equally important. I've never even actually done an auto, just a few simulated engine failures. I just study this shit, probably too much for my own good.  He says:  Step 1 - Cyclic back, collective down (simultaneously or in that order).  Step 2 - Pick a place to land, and make sure it's ""too close."" Too close is fine. You can handle too close, but you can't handle to far away!  Step 3 - MAKE THAT SPOT! Airspeed is not important, rotor RPM is important!  Step 4 - Make the best landing you can. Sit up straight, close your eyes...and wait until he noise stops.  Here's a pretty cool thread on the subject: Emergency Landings  Pete Gillies interview in Rotorcraft Pro"
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,4,Sat Dec 6 02:28:20 2014 UTC,"Step 3 - MAKE THAT SPOT! Airspeed is not important, rotor RPM is important!   Cringe... oh man.    This is not good advice."
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,3,Sat Dec 6 19:27:40 2014 UTC,Agreed. Airspeed is what you use to raise your RRPM before ground contact....this is why we flair. Without sufficient airspeed we may not be able to produce enough RRPM to cushion our landing.
Helicopters,2oer50,CrashSlow,3,Sat Dec 6 19:54:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but what if your only spot isn't a nice long runway like in your video? What if you were airspeeding and flaring right past your only spot and end up in a house or telephone pole instead? I think there are many ways of looking at this..."
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,2,Sat Dec 6 20:15:18 2014 UTC,"That's the way I saw it. Not every spot you're going to be able to cruise in at 6 5k and make a nice flair. In an emergency you won't have the luxury of knowing it's coming. You do what you need to do to get on the ground without killing yourself, the bird may die, but that's what insurance is for."
Helicopters,2oer50,fyrflier,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:34:47 2014 UTC,"Well, I think his point is that you can make a 0kt auto and survive, but you can't make an 80% rpm auto and survive. If you've only got one option for a spot, hit it, even if that means a 0kt landing.  Obviously if you've got the altitude for the airspeed you can trade for rpm. If you don't have the altitude or speed, keep the rpm."
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,2,Sat Dec 6 20:12:31 2014 UTC,"Wrong again.  Get 60kn at 100ft  nothing else before that matters.  Don't stall the rotor system, common sense.  You can recover rotor rpm in the flair, with 60kn, the rotor rpm will come back well into the green.  This will insure 0 forward airspeed and 0 rate of descent at touch down.    Your way will be, high rate of descent or high forward speed both are bad....     Here's reality.   CRASH SLOW..  Trees are soft, go for the small ones."
Helicopters,2oer50,CrashSlow,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:52:03 2014 UTC,If you've got 1 spot and 100' tall buildings all around you you may not be able to hold 60kt into your spot.
Helicopters,2oer50,Niatnuom,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:07:11 2014 UTC,"my ""plan"" (since I never want to actually try it if I can help it) was always down the lines of what CrashSlow is talking about. If there is no spot to go, as long as you arrive with roughly 60kts with a lot of RRPM, I'd flare ABOVE the obstacles, 100ft AGL above if I have to and then decent vertically into the spot cushioning what I can at that point. May not be pretty but ... I assume I would be better than running into something at 40kts plus trying to flare in the streets. But, like I said, I've never tried it and I hope I never have to. Flying twins now makes me feel better about this particular problem though ;)"
Helicopters,2oer50,Cropgun,1 point,Sun Dec 7 04:04:49 2014 UTC,"Probably not for practice autos at the airport, but in an emergency where you've got only one option for a spot you do whatever you have to to get to that spot and stay alive."
Helicopters,2oer50,fyrflier,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:36:02 2014 UTC,Your way will insure injuries or death.   How you arrive at your spot is way more important than just making it.
Helicopters,2oer50,CrashSlow,1 point,Sat Dec 6 21:14:48 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. If you've got trees they're good too. If you're in the middle of the city and you've got one spot or buildings, you've got to hit the spot. I'm not arguing with you because I think you're right too, a 0kt auto almost definitely insures injury. It is absolutely not ideal, if you have airspeed keep it!  I fly in IL, everything is a spot."
Helicopters,2oer50,CrashSlow,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:03:07 2014 UTC,Staying alive usually involves having enough airspeed at the bottom to trade with the physics fairies.  You're much better off having enough speed to flare and arrest your desent into a tree or building or something else undesirable than you'd be arriving at your perfect spot with not enough energy to actually stop falling out of the sky.   TL;DR: Slap whomever told you airspeed is not important.
Helicopters,2oer50,1josh13,2,Mon Dec 8 00:42:01 2014 UTC,"I agree with Cropgun. And it's not just Pete Gillies who says that. But he does have a lot of notoriety. Again, I'm not saying wait too long with the collective. I only have 300 or so hours in the Robby (and I do know about the low inertia rotor system) but I have 7000+in all kinds of other machines and I thought my comment might help out since you asked for comments (maybe you just meant the video itself and not the flying?) I have often found myself un-teaching the collective down-slam for hours with people coming in with that mind set who weren't taught aft cyclic first. As Cropgun mentioned, you can recover A LOT of RPM with aft cyclic and you can often get the speed back on the way down, but if just just reduce collective and then ""dive"" for your airspeed it will take you a lot longer to get the RPM back. Just trying to add a little input from instructing mostly guys breaking into the utility world, that's all...."

Helicopters,2oda0q,My_SFW_Account_,16,Fri Dec 5 15:13:28 2014 UTC,"Over-arching comes from not getting a rate of descent in. Instead you are probably leading with cyclic to slow your airspeed, then reducing the collective, which is causing you to maintain altitude and slow down. Under-arching usually comes from not arresting the rate of descent when you get close to ETL.  Draw a line from your head to the panel. When it looks like a good angle to you, reduce the collective to get a rate of descent going then add aft cyclic to begin slowing down. Scan to the side to check your apparent rate of closure. If panel or what ever you are using as your ground reference starts moving up the windscreen from the point that you entered you are falling through, if it's moving down your windscreen you aren't descending enough. The landing point should remain at the same point on your windscreen for 75% of the approach. Your approach angle is controlled entirely with the collective. In fact, once you get a progressive deceleration going, you shouldn't need your cyclic for anything until you get close to ETL and need to add a little forward. Once you start getting toward the ETL/Transverse Flow shutter, anticipate pulling in collective just enough to maintain you on your angle and change your gaze to somewhere to either side or just beyond the intended touchdown point. Add a little forward cyclic to maintain a constant deceleration rate and keep you from falling through.  The key is always leading with collective and maintaining a progressive deceleration.   Hope that helped.  Edit: words"
Helicopters,2oda0q,KTBFFHCFC,2,Fri Dec 5 15:27:11 2014 UTC,"Also a low initial rate of descent could stem from being too soft/tentative on the controls. I remember I had issues with my approaches because I was trying to baby the machine out of the sky, paranoid about overspeeding the turbine, etc. I'm not saying you should reef on the controls and dump the collective, but sometimes you've got to make assertive control movements to establish that positive rate of descent. As mentioned by another reply, you're flying the machine not the other way around.   Specific to the 206, I find sticking my left thumb out to touch my leg gives me a solid reference to how much I'm moving the collective. From cruise, I find reducing the power to about 30% Tq will give you about the right descent rate, then slight increase in collective will mitigate any over speeding. From there, decide if you need even less collective, or maybe a bit more for a longer shallower approach.  Steadily bring your speed back and maintain that visual of a walking pace over the ground. Load the disc back up (~60-70% Tq or more depending) before you lose translation and as you near your target, just keep telling yourself ""forward and down, forward and down"" and fly it to your spot.   And don't spend too much time hovering an inch off the ground trying for a perfect straight landing because the longer you sit there trying, the crappier it's going to get! And the more your fellow students will razz you about it later ;)"
Helicopters,2oda0q,HeliBif,2,Fri Dec 5 18:18:23 2014 UTC,"Trust your instruments. I've been in your shoes and I was flying too much by the seat of my pants. Believe what your VSI is telling you. Establish your rate of decent with power, not cyclic.   Shoot more approaches to the approach end of the runway. This should help you visualize your tendency to undershoot the last bit. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast; take your time on the last bit, to a reasonable degree.   And RELAX! pretty much no one fails because they don't pick up a maneuver right away. Keep up on your studying, and go for a run every once in a while"
Helicopters,2oda0q,pieboy68,2,Sat Dec 6 00:01:38 2014 UTC,"You may just be trying too hard.  You fly the helicopter, not the other way around.  Relax, try not to think about it too hard, and make the sum'bitch do what you want it to do.  Not much else to be said after KTBFFHCFC's post."
Helicopters,2oda0q,Cropgun,1 point,Fri Dec 5 16:27:24 2014 UTC,"Watch some youtube videos or something to get the right sight picture of what the correct approach angle looks like.  Then when you are flying the approach, collective controls above/below the approach path. Cyclic controls how quickly you go down the approach path.  As you come down, you are going to want to be bleeding off airspeed, which means lowing the collective initially (to avoid ballooning) and then increasing as the slower airspeed requires more power to maintain the decent rate. Keep bleeding speed back while keeping the decent rate the same until you get close to your spot.  At a point, you actually want your spot to go under you so that you land on it, so transition to a new spot 20-30' in front of your original spot. Keep that in the same place on the windscreen as you continue down and you'll hit your originally picked spot."
Helicopters,2oda0q,tarantulae,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:33:08 2014 UTC,"Something I learned that might help you polish up those last 50 feet. Find a reference off to the side of your intended point of touchdown, like a runway light or a taxi sign. For me, I draw a mental cross from that, maintaining ground track and by using that lateral reference it makes it a little easier to judge apparent closure rate.   The best thing you can do is learn to recognize when you're starting to go off your approach angle and make a correction then. In general the early you can catch the helicopter deviating from what you want it to do, the smaller the correction required. Wait to fix it and you'll be chasing aggressive inputs all over the place."
Helicopters,2oda0q,Cerebro64,1 point,Fri Dec 5 20:14:30 2014 UTC,"pretty well covered already by previous posts, but one more tip for the show. Not sure how familiar you are with performance as a subject (regarding mostly twin turbines, but there's something quite useful even to single turbines). Mainly regarding Landing Decision Points in this case. Check from your POH what's the Vtoss for your aircraft and try to hit that speed a couple hundred feet before landing and stick with it. You can start with nailing that speed even earlier, 500 ft on your first try if you really want a good amount of time to make sure you will hit your spot. Just use your collective to control the rate of descent (obiviously keeping it well below any tresholds to vortex ring state). If you fix your speed to something that is slow but still as safe as possible, you will have tons of time to estimate the amount of RoD needed. If you are good at keeping the AC in trimm, this will also free a lot of workload and you won't be piloting against yourself. You will be able to drain that speed to hover very quickly once you are committed to actually land - don't drain it before you are pretty much on your spot. (not advocating for 15 degree nose up flares in the last seconds thou - keep it controlled.)  This will make your approaches slow, so make sure you are communicating with your crew so that they are patient. Once you get more comfortable with the approach you can aim to hit Vtoss later."
Helicopters,2oda0q,Tunne,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:44:32 2014 UTC,"something I tell my students is to verbalize during the approach ""angle of descent with collective, rate of closure with the cyclic"". keep the intended landing spot in the same area on the wind screen throughout final approach. Brief walking speed out of your peripherals.  Good Luck, you'll get it."
Helicopters,2oda0q,swashplate,0,Wed Jan 28 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"the way my instructor thought me is.  Define 3 points  somewhere in the lower portion of your windshield.   One for normal, shallow and steep approaches.  (ask your instructor to mark them) and once you select and decide on your landing spot, set it on your mark and keep it there.

Helicopters,2o8you,KTBFFHCFC,2,Thu Dec 4 11:43:45 2014 UTC,"In the R22 and R44 this is the correct answer. If the collective isn't full down during shutdown, the blades will not only flap a lot more, but will stop coning and fall against the droopstops (which help hold the blades in a horizontal position) as the RPM decreases. This will wear the droopstops out if repeatedly done and eventually break them so the blades collapse and strike the tail cone."
Helicopters,2o8you,coriolinus,7,Thu Dec 4 19:53:29 2014 UTC,"In the UH-60, the controls should all be neutral and collective full down during rotor coast down to prevent anti-flap pounding. So, no we don't use the collective to slow the the rotors. The 60 also has a low inertia rotor system, so it slows down pretty quickly on its own. The 60M is equipped with a rotor brake for quick rotor stops after engine shutdown."
Helicopters,2o8you,KTBFFHCFC,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:00:11 2014 UTC,"Not quite: ""Collective: from full down position, raise no more than one inch."" That one inch does make a bit of difference."
Helicopters,2o8you,lowflier,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:50:08 2014 UTC,"I was referring more to the two Cautions, but you are correct, it says not more than 1 inch. It then goes on to say ""to prevent damage to anti-flap stops, do not increase collective pitch at any time during rotor coast down""."
Helicopters,2o8you,1mfa0,6,Thu Dec 4 22:53:34 2014 UTC,"In the H-60 models if you do this is results in droop stop pounding and occasional fragmentation.  Basically the blades will initially have enough lift to sort of float in a neutral position, but the point at which they lose this lift (with the collective raised) and drop happens to be pretty close to the point at which the droop stops come in.  This resulted in a lot of damaged droop stops (at least in Navy birds) and in a few cases the droop stops themselves fragged when this happened.  With the collective bottomed, this doesn't happen."

Helicopters,2o6wk2,Cropgun,1 point,Fri Dec 5 16:20:21 2014 UTC,"yes? The FARs are pretty clear on it. You need a Private Pilots License to qualify for a CPL(H), but it doesn't say anywhere what kind of private license. Therefor the fixed wing PPL qualifies. In the same way I could go straight to a commercial stiff-wing license without getting a PPL(A) first.  The issue with any of these shortcut-methods of getting a CPL(H) comes up when you try to get a job. It is hard enough to get hired with only 200hrs in helicopters, anything less than that and it would be downright impossible. So you will still end up spending the money to build your flight time. Employers are generally not really interested in fixed wing flight time."
Helicopters,2o6wk2,achwas,0,Thu Dec 4 06:53:14 2014 UTC,"You can do it, but I usually recommend against it if only for the reason that you need 35 hours PIC in helicopters to get your commercial.  If you don't have a rating then that means all of that is solo.  If you do have your rating, all flying after that can be logged as PIC whether you are getting instruction or taking your buddies up for a ride (and making them share the cost!)."

Helicopters,2o0u1k,USCAV19D,2,Sat Dec 6 20:46:15 2014 UTC,"That's a good pic, I'll repeat my post here as well.  The aircraft in that picture is currently secured to the flightdeck with chocks, chains, and the beams in the RAST (boxy looking thing under the radar dome) are closed around a probe that extends from the bottom of the aircraft. Once everything is secured, the ship will go to a ""red deck"" status and then it can maneuver however it wants to, usually until the helo is refueled and ready to take off again. ""Green deck"" means flight ops are underway and the ship cannot change course/speed until the helo is either secured on deck, or has safely departed the ship.  That being said, in this picture, the helo isn't spun up yet. First, there is still external power connected to it (thats the black cord plugged into the side). And second, in the bottom right corner of the pic you see a silver arm. That person is wearing a fire resistant suit and is only on the flightdeck until the APU is started, then he goes back inside once there is no engine fire."
Helicopters,2o0u1k,tp516,1 point,Wed Dec 3 02:52:10 2014 UTC,Could you explain how this RAST system works?
Helicopters,2o0u1k,J_Tomonaga,2,Wed Dec 3 15:01:36 2014 UTC,"RAST stands for Recovery Assist, Secure and Traverse, and serves a few purposes.  The recovery assist part is what they are practicing in this video.  It's used for scenarios when the sea state is extremely poor, dark, etc.  Its almost never used, and would be especially dangerous because you are putting more people out on the flight deck to hook up the cord and it would be fairly high risk if ever used.  Mostly, the RAST system is used for the secure and traverse part.  When the helo lands, beams in that little block on the flight deck close around the probe on the aircraft, securing it to the deck.  The point, other than safety while swapping out crews or refueling, is to eventually get the aircraft back inside the hangar and inside the superstructure.  I couldn't find a video of a 60 doing it, but this will give you an idea.  Moving a 20k lb aircraft by hand in rough seas cant safely be done by hand like in that video, so the RAST on Navy ships will slide along the tracks and essentially pull the aircraft along with it inside."

I always wanted to be a pilot, but was going to follow the more traditional path of flying airplanes once I had the money saved up.  Then I started working at the FBO at LNK, and I got to fuel StarCare pretty often.  I thought it was the most awesome machine, and I always stopped to watch it when it arrived/departed.  I tried to be ready with the truck and fuel it quick, in case they had to go again, but it was a difficult one to fuel quickly without spilling all over the ramp.  I started working night shift, and this helicopter was usually they only thing that would come in.  Sometimes we'd keep it in our hangar overnight for maintenance.  Often, once all of my work was done, I'd sit in the pilot seat and study all of the buttons and switches (without touching anything of course!), trying to figure out what things were, and dreaming about getting to fly something so cool.  Sometimes when she came in for fuel, the crew would hang out and watch TV in our pilot lounge (free popcorn!) before returning to base.  I'd pick the pilot's brain about flying helicopters until it was obvious I was becoming a nuisance.  I told them I would do it (I really wasn't sure how at the time, learning to fly is unbelievably expensive).  That was in 2006/7.  I'm a helicopter pilot now, living in the PNW, building the hours I need to get into EMS.  My goal has always been to make my way back home to Lincoln and fly 5SC.  This makes me sad."

Helicopters,2nx66s,velliin,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:01:39 2014 UTC,"As a Firefighter/Paramedic (and huge aviation buff) I saw this one come across my FB feed..and I was almost at a loss for words when I watched it  They say never say never right?, but at-least in the area where I work (Massachusetts) something like this almost could certainly never happen or at-least I like to think so. Our Aeromedical friends that we use are top-notch, and on calls where we need the bird which are usually bad calls to start everything involving the helicopter is pretty scripted and rehearsed. LZ's are pre-planned by both local services and medflight, typically baseball fields or the like, or if on a highway often times traffic is shut down in both directions (even on divided highways), pilot has direct communication with whichever fire department member is in charge of the LZ area and most departments have done training with the helicopters so we all know where to go, where not to go and who does what. Safety is #1 in everyone's book.  Here is some literature that we have access to: (http://www.bostonmedflight.org/images/PDFs/Landing_Zone_Information.pdf) (http://www.bostonmedflight.org/images/PDFs/Securing_LandingZone_Checklist.pdf)  Now obviously I wasn't there but by watching the video, Landing in the middle of what looks like a city intersection with little or no LZ security seems pretty high risk on the helicopter side of things. As to what the driver of the truck was thinking I have no idea (I'm sure at some point oh sh*t crossed his or her mind). I can speak from experience driving a firetruck to an emergency is pretty exciting, a big truck going fast, the noise, the lights the anticipation of getting to wherever you are going really can get the adrenaline pumping. Thats why we are trained to really stay conscious about the speed and control of our vehicles and communicate with everyone else on the truck to ensure a safe operation, after all if we can't get to where we are going for whatever reason we're no good to anyone.  Watching videos on youtube (and that is the extent of my knowledge on the subject) it would appear that pilots in other countries have much more discretion on where they can land their aircraft? I saw one recently which I think was from Germany where it looked as if it was taking off literally from someones tiny back yard?"

It's not exactly a flying sports car, but there's no comparing the difference in agility and sheer willingness to get going.  emergency procedures in a helicopter are about 1000x more complicated  for that matter, simple control touch is a bit more complicated in rotary wing. The controls are much more tightly coupled, unless you have mechanical / software mixing to decouple them certain instincts are different: taking off in a black hawk, you want to have about five degrees nose down to accelerate, for example.

From what I've heard from post military guys the real hard part is knowing how much PIC time they have since it's not usually tracked. Employers know this and will scrutinize your PIC flight time for honesty rather than care if it's in a book or on a computer. In addition, an excel spreadsheet doesn't have signatures from instructors in it to verify flight time.

Helicopters,2n9qjr,tarantulae,2,Tue Nov 25 14:17:01 2014 UTC,"What exactly do I need to look for when I visit these schools?   Helicopters and flight instructors. If they only have 1 helicopter, and it goes down for 2 weeks due to some maintenance issue, then you aren't flying during that time. Likewise, if they only have 1 or 2 flight instructors, and one gets sick, you're not getting to fly during that time. They should have enough of both that you can fly on a semi-regular basis. (2-3 times a week).   What all should I take into consideration if I want to be competitive in the job market?   Hours. Also, most pilot paths involve instructing as your first job. Most instruction is done in R22 helicopters. Depending on your weight, you will likely want to get at least 50 hours in R22 with an additional 25 in R44 during your training, as those are the most common helicopters you will be asked to fly. Additionally, they have their own special flight regulations which require those hour amounts. (SFAR 73)   Are there any questions I specifically should ask when I visit?   Previous accidents the school has had and what caused them. Is the school growing, shrinking, or stagnant. How is maintenance and helicopter/flight instructor availability? Most pilots first job is instructing at the school they trained at. If your school isn't growing, or if instructors aren't moving onto different jobs, then it might be harder to get your first job.   I have seen that some schools operate under different Part numbers. What does this mean, and does it matter what Part the school that I choose operates under?   Parts are Parts of the FAR (Federal Aviation Regulations). Part 61 deals with how you get pilot certificates. Part 141 is an optional part flight schools can certify under. It means the flight school has an FAA approved curriculum/syllabus and provides for lower requirements to get your license.  Also be cautious for schools which just want your money. Either asking for a lump sum payment up front, or stringing you along without really making progress. Don't be afraid to ask to switch instructors, or even just fly on a rotation with instructors. You are the customer, and if you aren't learning/making progress, then you should ask for something to change. Even if that means switching flight schools. As far as the ""lump sum up front"" google silver state helicopters and read what happened there for the hazards."

The training aircraft tend to be quite old and very out of date but the concepts are all the same, circles turning circles.    What work prospects did you have after completing the program.   I came out of school in the hay day so to speak. Our company hired 15-20 apprentices each spring. I gained a lot of experience really quickly and ended up having a great group of AMEs to learn from. These days the industry is in a slump but you have two ish years before you are ready to look for a job and anything could happen.    Is there anything you feel you weren't prepared for?   Most things. School is really only a basic starting point.  You will realize very quickly that you don't know shit, so don't pretend you do. The biggest factor to success early on in your career is attitude. Once you get a job no one cares that you were top of your class or that your dad owns the company. All that matters is that you can turn a wrench and follow the directions in the MM and your supervising AME.  May I remind you that no matter how much you think you know once you've completed school YOU DONT KNOW SHIT.  Cheers and good luck."

Helicopters,2n5ds1,tarantulae,2,Mon Nov 24 04:10:15 2014 UTC,"It's more of a fancy man's private helicopter. Don't have to worry about too many things, lots of power, storage, 4 hours of fuel, 3 blades (safer), fenestron tail rotor, no bottom of the dead man's curve, VNE of 130kt etc.   Yep, not so good if you're training and this is all you train in. Can't exactly jump across to the R22 easily! Or the R44 for commercial work either. May be useful in a few years if Mr Cabri makes a bigger model to rival the Squirrel or something?"
Helicopters,2n5ds1,achwas,2,Mon Nov 24 04:23:12 2014 UTC,"A trainer should be something that is easy to operate. There is more than enough stuff to be learned when you first start out, no need to make it more complicated or harder than it needs to be. It makes a lot more sense to gradually transition into trickier aircraft AFTER you know how to fly, rather than to start out with something hard and then go to easier aircraft. This whole ""if you can fly an R22 you can fly anything"" argument for learning in the R22 is pretty much BS if you ask me. Nobody would suggest to start out a new driver in a 1974 Porsche 911 because the thing is hard to drive, so why do the equivalent with helicopters. Flight training already has unacceptably high accident rates. A safer trainer with more reserves has no drawbacks at all - if you want to prepare students for flying with limited power for example, you can always just give them an artificial limit instead, rather than flying a marginal machine like an R22. This also gives them a lot more opportunity to learn, because the instructor doesn't have to take over as much to stop you from crashing. Same goes for autorotations etc.  The one and only reason the R22 is used as a trainer is because it is cheaper than anything else."
Helicopters,2n5ds1,tarantulae,1 point,Mon Nov 24 09:33:33 2014 UTC,"Do you consider R22's to be hard to operate? Between the 300, R44 and R22, they are all pretty similar to me. R22 changes RRPM a bit faster during autos, and other than that, they're all pretty similar. The R44 is a bit more stable than the other 2, but between the R22 and the 300, there isn't a ton of difference. In fact, I'd say the 22 is easier because it has a governor. The only problems you run into is power/weight which is also true for the 300."
Helicopters,2n5ds1,achwas,2,Tue Nov 25 00:06:55 2014 UTC,"Compared to pretty much anything else you'll ever fly, it has very marginal power with little to no reserves, is easy to overpitch, and has a very low inertia system that is hard to autorotate and must be kept very close to the numbers to successfully land without bending everything. The instruments are outdated and inaccurate, especially fuel and power. And you are dealing with a carburettor that can freeze up.  All of those issues can certainly be dealt with considering the low price for the machine (they are still unnecessary distractions in the year 2014, as proven by Cabri). The low inertia rotor on the other hand really is exactly the opposite of what you want in a trainer, and really adds unnecessary risks to an already dangerous profession. A lot of people never even experience a touchdown autorotation throughout their training because their school doesn't want to deal with the risks involved with it, therefore clearly sacrificing training quality.  I find people make much quicker progress when they learn to fly in a more forgiving machine. The student learns much more and quicker when the instructor can let them screw up a bit, let them know what they need to do, and let them fix it themselves. In the R22 more often than not, the instructor has to take over almost immediately. Certainly much sooner than in most other machines. This gives the student less opportunity to learn how to fix the issue themselves, so basics like hovering, approaches, or autorotations take longer to learn.  Transitioning from another machine to a R22, if required, is also not that hard once they have the basics down and under control.  The S300 is a somewhat better trainer imo, although some people seem to struggle more with the lack of governor initially. I bet this depends greatly on the quality of the instructor though, and I have little time in them so I'm probably not qualified to judge. Either way, I would also call the S300 completely outdated, and I doubt they will be around much longer with all the trouble after the recent sale of the company. The spare part situation for them is terrible right now, to say the least.  The R44 isn't a bad trainer, better than both of the above I'd say. It definitely takes fewer hours to reach the same level of proficiency/safety in it compared to the R22. Some precautions have to be taken as with any multi seat helicopter - the instructor should definitely occasionally load the machine up to MTOW later in the training, so the student can get used to how it flies when all seats are occupied."
Helicopters,2n5ds1,mast-bump,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:47:49 2014 UTC,"Marginal power? I don't know. For training flights, we've never ran into power issues which prevented us from doing our training. Now, if you wanted to actually do something with the heli other than training, I could see getting into power requirement issues, but as it is, flying around with 2 people in it, it does just fine. Easy to overpitch? If you overpitched then you already blew your power limit. Pilot error, that simple.  Outdated and inaccurate instruments? What is inaccurate about manifold pressure? Fuel senders are required to be within a certain amount of accuracy so I don't get that inaccuracy either.  I agree that the most dangerous part of flying an R22 is the low inertia rotor. Carb heat adds to that because that is pilot controlled and can cause you to lose the engine. That said, carb heat is not exactly a difficult thing to do."
Helicopters,2n5ds1,FEDylan,2,Tue Nov 25 17:48:37 2014 UTC,"Yes, marginal power. Two people on and now can't take full fuel, and it will barely hover OGE on a warm day, that is marginal power compared to anything else you will fly.   Easy to overpitch? If you overpitched then you already blew your power limit. Pilot error, that simple.   Exactly. And what happens during training? That's right, pilot errors, that's the whole point of training. In the R22 there is a very fine line between pulling a little too much, and pulling your RPM down. Especially if you are not at sea level. At higher altitudes you can also overpitch without exceeding your power limit.   Outdated and inaccurate instruments? What is inaccurate about manifold pressure?   Manifold pressure is not an accurate way to measure power, that's why your MAP limits change based on temperature and pressure. They actually also should change based on carb heat on/off (and Robinson kinda acknowledges this in one of their newest SNs), but I guess that just got too complicated.   The only reason MAP is used is because it is the easiest way to get any power related indication out of a piston engine. The Cabri improves this by automatically making the calculations for you and giving you a percentage, just like you get on a turbine.   Fuel senders are required to be within a certain amount of accuracy so I don't get that inaccuracy either.   You have two gauges that you need to add together, and they each only have 3 lines between E and F. When you actually calibrate the gauges (which is required in other countries, not in the US) you will find that the amount in the tanks at each of those lines differs greatly from machine to machine, so your finely tuned weight and balance calculation that you do as a student is really pretty much bollocks, and this is for a machine where you are almost always at MTOW when you have two people on board. Not to mention that you have to wait after refuelling for the levels to equalize to get a reasonable reading in the first place.   More modern aircraft have more accurate, single fuel gauges that show you the total amount.   That said, carb heat is not exactly a difficult thing to do.   It shouldn't be, and it isn't in the R44 Raven 1. In the R22 unfortunately, the temperature probe is not located in the correct spot, leading to this reassuring placard ""below 18"" MAP, disregard gauge and apply full carb heat"". You have a CAT gauge that doesn't actually show you if you are at risk of getting carb ice because the probe is not mounted at the coldest spot in the carburettor. It's just another one of those things that was never fixed due to costs, and has led to many lost aircraft over the years.  I don't ""hate"" the R22. Hell, like most people I did learn to fly on them, and I think I have a bit over 2,000hrs in them overall. I just think they are a terrible aircraft for a beginner pilot."

I understand what you're trying to say, but if I had to do it again, I honestly think that I would just try to borrow the money for a CPL than go work for Uncle Sam. Even if I got raked over the coals with the interest rate. And yes, I am 'that guy' before you ask.  OP, the application packet and associated instructions for applying to WOTC can be downloaded from the Army's warrant officer recruiting page. Someone else linked it here. You can just download the instructions and assemble your application packet yourself and mail it in.  BUT. I would ONLY do that if it's like your life dream to be an Army helicopter pilot warrant officer. What I'm trying to say is, if all that's keeping you from your CPL is money, or if it ISN'T your life dream to be a an Army helicopter pilot, just borrow the money and stay a civilian. These guys get their ratings much more ""cheaply"" than the civilians who have to pay for training, but they pay for those ratings in 10,000 other intangible, sometimes very damaging ways. I'm not trying to badmouth the military or mil aviation or the warrant officer/commissioned officer corps, but please. Do yourself a favor. Only apply to be a warrant officer in the Army if that is exactly what you want to do. If you don't know exactly what you're applying for, do your best to find out. If you just need money or hours, there are ways to get them that don't involve joining the military. If you join up because you need hours or because you want to go to college, you've just maximized your chances of having a bad time. Especially nowadays.

Helicopters,2msnao,helitwat,4,Wed Nov 19 18:51:04 2014 UTC,"Any American or even European helicopter would be much much more efficient and cheaper. The mi-26 is HUGE, and getting very old. Maintenance & fuel would be in the millions per year. It would be a hard time trying to find Russian parts in the usa,  far from cheap. Never mind keeping it up to FAA specs. The mi-26 was made for heavy cargo transport; more than wildly inefficient for moving passengers around. The mi-26 is still in use because if it's absurd cargo capacity; even then that's for cargo that can not be split up, it would be cheaper to dispatch 2 or 3 smaller helicopters, splitting the work. The only reason for using the mi-26 would be for the novelty of using the largest helicopter around. Ask any local charters in your target area. See if you can invest with them for additional rotor crafts in their fleet. Or look up near by areas, see what they are doing."
Helicopters,2msnao,Sierra-X117,2,Wed Nov 19 19:58:39 2014 UTC,"The MI-26 is decades newer than a sky-crane or Chinook and better engineered.   An mi-26 was in Canada for years.  The biggest problem operating it was the north american heavy lift companies could not compete.   So they wined and complained to anyone who would listen. It was brought over to move a Coil-tubing rig(oil field stuff) that exceed what a chinook or air-crane could move efficiently.

Eg the 26 was lifting office trailers, and all the furniture had to get taken out and made into a load for a Kamov or Vertol or 205.

Helicopters,2msnao,HeliBif,1 point,Thu Nov 20 16:26:58 2014 UTC,"thanks for the insightful comment.  I figured bigger -> more headcount -> more accessible to a less affluent customer base (which is monstrous) -> more efficiency...even if I could only book 20-30 people per trip it could usurp 3 cheaper helos+crews even if maintenance is pricy. Russian parts, knowledgable mechanics, pilots are the unknown so your comment is useful.   The greatest issue (way more sensitive than aircraft selection) is that local charters are located in areas not effective for the clientele and the point A & point B I have in mind.  I have a few places in mind that could be easily used, but aren't for some reason which I'm investigating."

(Or maybe you can't say) Members of the ""less affluent customer base"" usually don't have a reason to go flying in helicopters in the first place, so it seems an odd demographic to cater to.  There's a reason why companies like Bristow, PHI, CHC, and the like who fly crew transfers for offshore oil have fleets of Sikorsky 61's, 76's, 92's, AW139's, etc. And you can bet they've got the best bang-for-buck setup figured out."

Helicopters,2mn2ro,ComradeGiraffe,3,Tue Nov 18 17:18:07 2014 UTC,The USMC use the UH-1's basically in the same role the Army uses the OH-58D right? or is it still used for transport too?
Helicopters,2mn2ro,Tarnsman4Life,2,Tue Nov 18 17:41:11 2014 UTC,"From my understanding, the OH-58D is a hunter killer, close air support? Thats what ive read in some books of what they are called in to do.  For the USMC the Cobras and Hueys are the same squadrons so they leave together the Cobras are more of the hunter killer. The Hueys will be more suppressor fire with its mini gun on one side and its longer range .50cal on the other. Huey is not effective to mainly transport as it cant take a lot of people. There is really not a lot of room if you have 2 crewchiefs, the guns and the ammo. Maybe 2 fully loaded infantry guys can fit and it would be super tight. With no guns and just one Crew Chief you can have 6 fully loaded infantry.  The UH-60's are bigger on the inside for comparison."
Helicopters,2mn2ro,USCAV19D,3,Tue Nov 18 18:48:17 2014 UTC,"The KW is an aerial scout platform, it's mission is to find enemy forces and direct attack assets onto said enemy force. It has a secondary ability to engage the enemy itself, but owing to its small size the amount of weapons it can carry is limited. I'd think that in a proper force-on-force fight, the KW would only engage the enemy when it is a target of opportunity (lone recon vehicle) or out of sheer necessity (oh shit, there's a ZSU across the valley). Their armament consists of a rocket pod with seven 2.75"" rockets, a modified 50 cal with a higher ROF, or up to two Hellfires. Due to weight restrictions a trade-off with fuel is usually made. Oh, and the ubiquitous co-pilot leaning out the door with his M4 really is a thing. It's real, its beautiful, and it's about the most motivating thing I've ever seen on deployment. It can also use its mast mounted sight to designate targets for other birds, specifically the Hellfires of Apaches that it is operating in hunter/killer teams with.  In Iraq and Afghanistan it was shoehorned into a CAS role because of how plentiful they were, as well as how inexpensive to operate and maintain they were compared to AH-64s. Does the KW do a hell of a job supporting ground troops? Fuck yeah. But it can't attack like a bird with 8 Hellfires, dozens of rockets, and a 30mm chain gun can. One is designed to find the bad guys, one is designed to kill them. As a long-time ground-bound recon guy, I can tell you (without any bias) that finding the enemy is really all the fun these days.  I'm not a KW pilot, but I've been supported by them an awful lot. I'll defer to /u/evannever for further comments."
Helicopters,2mn2ro,USCAV19D,2,Tue Nov 18 21:33:34 2014 UTC,"Damn, good info thanks. Yea the Huey's will usually just have rockets and the 2 crew served weapons. A .50 cal and a 7.62 mini gun. A lot of guys get qual's on the M240D but its pretty wimpy, its fun to shoot though."

Helicopters,2m7xv0,InfiniteNameOptions,3,Thu Nov 13 21:44:23 2014 UTC,"Most published papers you will find on this are too specific, so here are some generalized things to consider when searching:   Intermesh rotors will usually have a larger footprint than coax, since the two rotors are offset some distance from each other's spin axis. In general this leads to a lower disk loading for meshed rotors. Since both rotors on intermesh must be tilted slightly, neither lifts directly vertically. This reduces efficiency for each rotor. I can't say in general if this efficiency loss is greater/less than interference losses in coax since that depends on the specific rotor designs. Even though mesh rotors have two separate hubs, each hub can be relatively simple. Coax rotor masts are about as complicated as they come, since controls have to link through multiple swashplates. Although very unlikely, intermeshed rotors run the risk of becoming desynchronized due to gearbox failure, which can destroy the rotors. I believe there are a few cases of this happening (citation needed).   That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Most of my knowledge of intermesh rotors comes from my helo design classes in undergrad. Hope it helps!"

I believe there are a few cases of this happening (citation needed).   You might be referring to the K-Max having blade strikes with itself, but I believe those are not due to gearbox failure. There is apparently a certain flight configuration which can cause the rotors to come a bit too close to each other, I believe it is right pedal during a descending turn or something like that. Sounds like that is a type specific issue and not necessarily an inherent problem of mesh rotors."

I stumbled across this: http://www.unicopter.com/UniCopter.html But they seem to have settled into a pro-intermeshing bias.  I'm starting to get the impression that intermeshing is better for heavier loads and coaxial is better for higher speed."
Helicopters,2m7xv0,FG_kano,1 point,Fri Nov 14 14:49:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it is very difficult to find an apples to apples comparison. I think part of the problem is that inter-meshing rotors simply aren't used very much in industry. And it is probably just because of many small reasons that add up, not because one configuration is drastically better.  Another difference to add is that the rotor separation in an inter-meshed configuration increases the aircraft's moment of inertia about the yaw axis (there is more mass farther away from the yaw axis). So an inter-meshing rotor configuration will have less yaw authority than a coax."
Helicopters,2m7xv0,HeliBif,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:31:43 2014 UTC,"The only thing I can think of off the top of my head, is that coax have better yaw control than meshed (I remember hearing that yaw control on the Kmax is essentially nil?)"

Helicopters,2m6dc9,Great_Dane89,2,Thu Nov 13 19:01:02 2014 UTC,"It was designed for a war that ended before it could be used in it, but we continued to develop it to be one of the first countries in the world to have our own dedicated attack helicopter.  Helicopters are expensive to produce, especially military ones. This is a big part of the reason so few were produced. Another is the fact that it was designed during the Apartheid era in South Africa, and therefore other countries were not allowed to trade with us. This meant that while it was perfectly capable, it was just not an option for other militaries to buy any.  An example I have heard of is that the Royal Air Force intended to buy some, but the U.S. threatened to stop supplying them with the missiles they were already using on their Apaches, so they had to decline.  The extent of real combat testing of this rare attack helicopter is limited to that in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they were shipped to to assist the UN in peacekeeping missions in the region.

Probably when running all over gets old and I want to stay home and have a steady schedule.  But for right now, for what I want to do in life, I have no need at all for an instrument rating.  Lots of people will say its good to have just for the skill set, and I agree, but you can learn many of those skills from reading and practicing on your own.

The aircraft that were sold to Allied Wings are completely different from the 412CF configuration which was never meant to be used other than ferry flights. I believe the ""official"" name of this configuration is CT-146.

While decoy flares were effective at jamming first generation infra-red guided missiles, each flare was only effective for a short period. If an aircraft needed to loiter over a high risk area or was flying slowly (as helicopters do), it would require a large number of flares to decoy any missile fired at it.

Helicopters,2ln5tn,retreatingbladestall,2,Fri Nov 14 18:34:32 2014 UTC,"True story, but a little long....  When I was in an Attack BN at Rucker, and yes they had a FORSCOM BN there, I used to schedule all APRT's to end up in Floralla or down to Tallahassee for a Hooters visit.  One night the BN CDR was flying in for his bi-monthly single NVS proficiency flight.  I heard the radio call and decided to leave before he came in.  On the climbout the infamous ""trapped gas disparisym"" hit and I told the pilot to level off for a bit.  It worked and I felt that I was okay to climb up to the minimum safe altitude for his instrument portion.  Now, Floralla BBQ is fantastic and I loved the onions and jalapenos covering it.  But usually I waited to take off until after the effects either subsided on its own or I made use of the very clean facilities they had, but that night due to my rushed departure, neither one happened.  Anyway, when we finally got near Samson on radar vectors, it all hit.  I took the controls, cancelled IFR and landed at Samson for a quick reduction in my weight.  I told the pilot in the back to leave it running and I went around the back of the hangar and deposited that fantastic BBQ in a very wet and rapid fire mode.  No bathroom, the field squat with the good flight suit tied up and around my knees.  No TP so my Army brown t-shirt made the ultimate sacrifice.  The whole spicy incident lasted a total of 30-45 seconds and I felt better but slightly naked with no t-shirt under the zippers, no mind, I walk back feeling very relieved, the Apache was still running so I climbed in, strapped in and hooked up ICS, as soon as I had comms the pilot was freaking out, it was his eval and we were almost done, naturally he wanted the misery to end that same night so he told me that he saw me coming back and tried to start the engines 2 times, the start light would go on when he hit the start switch but would go right back out, he was asking me to help him figure it out when I very rudely interupted him and turned on the landing light to show him the rotors were turning at 101%.  Needless to say he still passed, we didn't shear the ATS shafts, and I still got away from the BN CDR before he could ask me to ""give"" him his APRT.  All in all it was a good and uneventful trip to Floralla."
Helicopters,2ln5tn,Ralphie63,4,Sun Nov 16 06:20:46 2014 UTC,"That's pretty wild -- the hawk is similarly entertaining below its design weight; in the first few weeks of the 60 course the IP let my buddies pull 120% torque on a vertical takeoff at ~13500 GW to ""get a feel for the aircraft.""

Helicopters,2llu31,cogitofosho,3,Sat Nov 8 04:21:48 2014 UTC,"easier said than done in a single pilot helicopter with (most likely) no SAS or AP system. There was a study that determined (iirc) that it takes pilots an average of 30+ seconds to effectively transition from VFR to instruments even if they know that's what they are going to do, and are IFR current. From personal experience, I agree with that. At 100' AGL, 30 seconds of more or less uncoordinated flight in a helicopter is a damn long time... especially if you start out at 20 knots.  Point is, once they let it get to that stage, their chance of survival was small. No matter what."
Helicopters,2llu31,achwas,2,Sat Nov 8 06:17:57 2014 UTC,"I completely agree. I've heard that study before. One would assume Alaskan troopers are required to be IFR current (though I wouldn't know for sure). Point is, if you're in weather that bad and you aren't already on an IFR clearance, you should be keeping a good instrument scan so you're ready for the inevitable. I put the above in quotes as a reminder to us all the importance of working that mantra into muscle memory and trusting our instruments. This could've been any one of us, which is why it's so important we take a minute to learn from it."

For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to first cause the helicopter to roll or pivot around a skid, or landing gear wheel, until its critical rollover angle is reached. Then, beyond this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible. If the critical rollover angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic control corrections made.

Helicopters,2l5278,isoperimetric,5,Mon Nov 3 07:28:03 2014 UTC,"I personally know several pilots with their A&P and they have all considered it a curse to the point that they have stopped telling employers that they are an A&P. mechanics are harder to find than pilots. Being both a pilot and a mechanic can get them a job but they always end up turning wrenches instead of flying. These guys are told by the employers that they will do both but being a mechanic always takes priority and these guys find themselves losing a lot of flight time in order to perform maintenance instead.  Like I said, these guys who would rather fly don't even tell employers that they have an A&P. And as a low time pilot they have trouble getting a job without tagging their A&P onto a résumé so it's a bit of a catch22. In a perfect world, having both would skyrocket him to the top of the career field but unfortunately it doesn't work that way for most guys."

They don't make much money and flying goes from being enjoyable, to being a job. You can make much more money being a mechanic, expecially if you become a manager or work for a big company. Mechanic work is solid, guaranteed income. Being a pilot is usually inconsistent and competitive. Which is why I'm getting my A&P so I can afford to learn to fly at my own leisure. Eventually I will get my commercial, but being a mechanic will always be my priority."

Helicopters,2l5278,secretgspot,1 point,Mon Nov 3 08:25:46 2014 UTC,From what I've read mechanics top out at 50-60k a year where as helicopter pilots top out closer to 70-80k. Is it just better since there is less time investment involved in the mechanics?
Helicopters,2l5278,secretgspot,2,Mon Nov 3 19:13:21 2014 UTC,you won't be getting 70-80k for a while.  There are way too many low time pilots are willing to work/fly pretty much for free
Helicopters,2l5278,n053b133d,1 point,Mon Nov 3 20:03:35 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I don't mean to keep bugging you. But certainly being a flight instructor is not a full time job? He could work as a mechanic during the day and build his flight hours at night on the weekends? Maybe I am underestimating it.   His dream is to fly. He would really like his A&P to be his backup. I am worried about potential earnings for both. I feel the A&P makes barely a middle class income. Whereas a pilot's earns a much more livable wage, even if it takes time to build up to that."

If you work on turbines for a larger company, it is possible to start out at 50k or more. Pilots usually start out near minimum wage for a few years until they can build enough hours to advance their position. It really depends on how far you want to move for your job, and how long you're willing to wait to find that job."

I'd rather not discuss the specifics of my pay on this account, however I can tell you that if a motivated person gets into heavy helicopters, it's possible to be making 90-100k within 10 years and have a rotation like mine.  Starting pay for a mechanic in heavy helicopters with a rotation would probably be somewhere around 30-35k.  Without the rotation it's more like 50-60k, but that means working all. The. Time."

But no I would say it's not too late if this is something you really want to do, in fact I'd say you are just in the right age range. No employer wants to hire a 19 year old 100hr pilot and give them a million dollar aircraft. But know this, the helicopter  industry in canada is not in a good situation to accept more low time pilots, there are very few jobs for the inexperienced as the client hour requirements keep getting higher and higher. Ask the 1000+ hour guys flying around the oil patch doing lease to lease flights that were previously used for the low time guys to build time on. do your research on school, pick one that hires from their graduates. There's one school in springbank that hires their students directly into flying positions. That is your best shot."

Take everything the flight schools tell you with a grain of salt. The Canadian helicopter industry is volatile and currently in a slump.   Several major operators made lay off this fall. As a 100 hr pilot, if you're lucky enough to get work (and rest assured, that work will not be in a cockpit for several years), you'll also be the first to be shown the door when things get tight.   It's never too late to pursue your dreams, and I enjoy what I do (most of the time) but I wouldn't advise anyone to start down this path right now, let alone a 28 year old with an already solid career path.

Don't let any schools tell you it's easy to get a job in this industry.. it's anything but.  I'm very fortunate to work for a company with stable work year round, but it sounds like a lot of companies are really having a hard time and theres a lot of high time guys that are concerned about what the future holds.  Not trying to discourage you, but you have to do some research and understand how hard it is going to be if you decide to invest 50-60 grand on a license.  The job prospects these days for a freshly licensed pilot are grim.  You have to be extremely passionate about flying and want it more than the other 100 hour wonders that the schools just seem to keep pumping out and the majority of companies  in this industry won't even consider you with less than 1000 hours.

It will pay 100% of tuition and fees up to the highest in state PUBLIC tuition in a given state.  To elaborate: lets say UC Berkley is the most expensive in state tuition in California(it isn't but for the sake of argument) the GI bill will pay 100% of your tuition at kerkley or any other public school... OR up to that amount at a more expensive private school and you pay the difference. (some exceptions: see Yellow Ribbon Program)  Flight training, to my knowledge is the single most expensive program you can use the GI bill for.  I have received around 86,000 dollars in benefits, and used only 9 of my 36 months of education benefits... theoretically you could spend a couple hundred grand of uncle sams money using the GI bill.  not just 36 thousand."

Helicopters,2l2je9,jamesah2008,2,Mon Nov 3 02:45:33 2014 UTC,"If you don't go active duty, you won't be eligible for the full benefits of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, which would pay for all the flight training. Recruiters do not like to talk about WOCS, OCS, ROTC because they don't want to lose a potential enlisted recruit. Find an officer recruiter if you want to go to WOFT. You usually have to be enrolled in a college program to get flight ratings paid for and (I think) it must be in pursuit of (your first) bachelor's degree. Whatever you do, you need to get an exact dollar by dollar breakdown of what benefits you get. To include which Chapter G.I. Bill you'll be eligible for, what SLRP you might get, and what bonuses you'll get and when. I didn't realize what my scholarship covered and it didn't cover aviation fees as an ROTC cadet."
Helicopters,2l2je9,Nipplefinger,1 point,Sun Nov 2 16:10:15 2014 UTC,"Good point about finding an officer recruiter.  I forgot to mention that.  Also, I think the best kept secret of all commissioning sources is the Navy ""BDCP"" Program.  It will pay you as an E-3 to finish your last two years of college and then guarantee you an OCS slot when you graduate.  Not to mention, you're accruing leave the entire two years before you're actually in the military.    It seems like your timing could work for this.  Call an officer recruiter to apply.  https://www.navycs.com/officer/bdcp.html"
Helicopters,2l2je9,amnhanley,0,Sun Nov 2 22:50:54 2014 UTC,My recruiter was basically saying that the street to seat program was basically dead and that the best way to do it is for me to enlist as an e3 and then when I make e5 to apply w For wocs and woft. He also said that I would be eligible for the post 9/11 GI Bill of I did at least one year of active guard reserve or deployed overseas.
Helicopters,2l2je9,USCAV19D,3,Sun Nov 2 23:40:32 2014 UTC,"Your recruiter is a fucking liar.  Recruiters are the worst the military has to offer.  It's not their fault... the service molds them into that because that's the nature of their mission.  I am an air force veteran and commercial pilot with 1000 hours PIC and I was interested in joining the army as a warrant officer and my recruiter told me the same thing.  Every recruiter on the planet will feed you that line... a WOCS packet is a lot more work, and they don't count towards their quota... Why should a recruiter do all that work to help you if it doesn't even count toward his recruitment goals?  it's a waste of his time... street to seat is going strong.  check out the forums on verticalreference.com for all your questions regarding the program.  the guys in the military forum over there will be super helpful."

They had WOs until the mid 80's but got rid of them as they felt that the ranks of E-8 and E-9 sufficiently covered their needs.  In the Army one of the reasons that WOs fly is because RLOs(real life Officers), as they get promoted, will fly less and be in a command role.  This is taking valuable experience out of the cockpit.  Warrant Officers will fly much later into their career as that is their primary job(along with their track, either Instructor Pilot, Maintenance Test Pilot, Safety Officer, or Tac Ops Officer)."

Helicopters,2kkr6h,jawknee21,1 point,Sat Nov 8 03:40:40 2014 UTC,While it is competitive there are a specific percentage of all WO accessions that have to be street to seat.  Since that number has to be picked up and generally that aren't many street to seat packets boarded there is a much higher percentage of applicants picked up.  There are a lot more active duty applicants so there is more competition.

Helicopters,2kkr6h,Optamix,2,Tue Oct 28 20:59:55 2014 UTC,Why did it get canceled?  Do you guys have a problem losing experienced pilots to command roles or is the organization set up differently to prevent that?
Helicopters,2kkr6h,cardbox205,2,Tue Oct 28 22:02:03 2014 UTC,"The Navy's set up for squadrons is just completely different than the Army's so it doesn't really work.  For the Army guys warrants are pretty much pure pilots, the officers are supposed to do most of the admin/leadership roles and also get to fly.  In the Navy pretty much everyone has to have some sort of admni role due to the complex nature of planning things when flying on ships.  Especially on a detachment where you might only have 4 pilots to run a det.  The warrants in the Navy ended up getting treated just utilized just like everyone else so then you end up with guys who are doing all the same work but are getting paid less and can't climb up the command ladder.   It is true though that as we get more senior we don't get to fly as much.  We also have 'disassociated sea tours' where we are supposed to go out and fill roles on ships so we can be more well rounded.  Some people are able to get flying jobs, but most of us have to be ship's company on a carrier or amphib and not fly for a couple of years, which is pretty frustrating."
Helicopters,2kkr6h,Cerebro64,2,Wed Oct 29 03:17:04 2014 UTC,"Straight up, its just how the different services established their aviation programs decades ago, and you associate WO's with heli's because the Army - who uses the WO pilots - has more heli's than anybody else. As somebody else mentioned, WOs fly FW in the Army as well, there are just far fewer FW assets. It has nothing to do with ""requirements"" so much as... that's just how its done."

I believe they're still testing it at their West Palm Beach facility.  I may have even gotten to look around this very test vehicle several years ago when it was still just an empty hull.  It does have improved lift capabilities but I think it has more to do with upgraded rotors and the GE38 engines than composites.  Also, the payload numbers appear to be WAY off.  I have a book open in front of me (Modern Military Aircraft Anatomy) which states that the CH-53E has a max payload (internal over 115 mile radius) of 36,000lb.

Funny story about the RC helicopter question. A friend of mine let me fly his once. I was terrible at it! It was one of those micro-copters that you control with an iPhone.

For the average person, it's easier to grasp the concept of ""This makes you go forward, this makes you go backwards, this turns left and right""  For anyone who has even a basic understanding of how a helicopter ought to fly, it just ends up being confusing and overly difficult.  The guy at the hobby store tried his best to talk me out of a collective-pitch RC Heli (the kind that actually behave like the real thing), but I found it 100x easier because it made sense to me.  The starter helis are generally coaxial and the tail rotor is horizontally mounted to provide pitch authority because there is no swashplate. This means you have no cyclic roll. If the wind starts taking you to the left, your only course of action is to yaw around and pitch into the wind. By the time you do that, you've already hit the fence.  If you ever want to fly something that will make sense to you, pick up a Nano CP X for about $100. Durable as hell, and the parts are cheap when you break stuff. Great fun :)"

I can honestly tell you the VA is taking a hard look at COCC's program and making it somewhat of a flagship and poster child for what they'd like to see in an aviation program. There's not any ""good ole' boy"" crap going on around here, but I've heard that about SUU and some of the other Mormon dominant schools(nothing wrong with Mormons, just stating facts). The employing of grads as instructors at LEA is fairly consistent, the instructors that get their hours for big boy jobs tend to leave as soon as they do and move onto bigger and better things leaving room for new instructors, and who do you think they're going to hire? Joe Schmoe from across the country or a young sapling they've nurtured and watched grow into a suitable IP before their eyes?

Once you're employed and on the career path, then start thinking about getting a BA/BS.  Get a degree in something useful, not ""helicopter pilot"".

In my opinion, the biggest thing that lowers your success rate is not planning right.    You have to be prepared to spend upwards of 60-100k for training so hopefully you have someone who can co-sign a loan. (federal student loans will not cover just flight training) RESEARCH THE FLIGHT SCHOOL! Usually a Part 141 regulated school is what you want. They have stricter standards that have to be met to maintain their school certificate from the FAA. Not only is quality of training important but you want a busy school. Busy flight schools mean faster turn around of instructors, which means better chances of getting hired on after training.  Degrees aren't required but they definitely do not hurt. Especially at the chief pilot position for most operations.    You can pm me if you have more questions"

Just like you'll start seeing a flood of automated vehicles in California, now that it's legal.   FAA has a lot invested into developing automated system, so are insurance companies.

At this stage, there is a lot more button pushing required in an airliner cockpit (even and especially with auto land!) than you probably think. The first pilotless helicopters will actually be remotely piloted, and it will still take at least a decade before the average passenger is willing to get into a machine with no one in the drivers seat. Not to mention that there is very little incentive to make them, anyhow - a remote controlled helicopter that still has human passengers on board doesn't actually have any real advantages over one with a pilot in the seat.   It will happen, but not that quickly for the most part. Survey and aerial photo sort of work will slowly be taken over by smaller drones, cargo and external load flying will probably follow, and anything involving passengers will be way down the line. Even decades from now there will still be some pilots employed in any of these roles though, as this industry is very slow to spend loads of money on new technologies."

Both of those are partially remote controlled, not fully autonomous.   regarding having a pilot or not, of course not having a pilot in the machine has it's advantage. Weight!!!   Most machines <6 seats would actually get heavier if you removed the pilot, because they would first have to be equipped with an autopilot system, and then you would have to add sensors and a redundant (remote or autonomous) control system. Actually both would be necessary if carrying passengers for safety reasons, as a remote controlled aircraft would be way to easy to interfere with. Auto-land capabilities would be required as backup, which means a ton of sensor equipment to make that possible.  Surely you COULD design a helicopter to be somewhat lighter with no cockpit if you did so from scratch, but it wouldn't be black and white at all. The MQ8-B above for example is a modified Schweizer 333, and it is actually quite a bit heavier than the manned aircraft (940kg empty vs. 550kg, so even with a pilot the Schweizer is still 300kg lighter and has nearly twice the payload). Oh and it costs $18 million per unit, vs. around $500,000 for the Schweizer 333....  You are talking about an industry that still largely runs on 30 year old Jet Rangers. Speed of adoption is not going to be very high, unless a very significant operating cost benefit can be realized. As of right now, it's still very much the other way around.  Relying on ground equipment like Cat-3 is not practical for helicopters, the whole point of them is NOT to land on airports."

Helicopters,2jtv84,achemze,1 point,Wed Oct 22 00:53:01 2014 UTC,"I agree that most airplanes can fly themselves, the technology is there but there's very little fail-safe for when those systems are offline. When the automation is unavailable, someone still needs to take care of it.  What happens when you're VOR goes out? You lose a radio? an Engine? Once you have an emergency situation, you need human involvement to determine the right course of action. This is why there's still 2 people in a auto-fly-commercial-jet. When it hits the fan, you need to switch to APU power, re-initiate a few systems and then continue to use the automation to land.   I dont deny that the FAA is invested in automation however even ATC is still a predominately manual process. If they haven't successfully automated the traffic management, how can they successfully automate the traffic?! NEXRAD has been around since 1990 and it's still not everywhere. The limitation isn't just desire, its also money and ability.  In the last 10 years? In Aviation? The price of avgas and maintenance is about it. A bunch of NTSB reports, A few new models and a bunch of old ideas reborn. What do you attribute to it?"
Helicopters,2jtv84,Arcturus2,2,Wed Oct 22 02:37:34 2014 UTC,"If a video game can do it, that's pretty much it.   A video game ""does it"" in an extremely constrained environment with very few variables. It's not even slightly analogous to real life.   Whats stopping them from doing point A, B, C, D return HOME via GPS POI?   In a sense, they already do (but they use ATC vectors and ILS, not GPS because it isn't precise enough). Commercial fixed-wing pilots can easily fly an entire route without touching the yoke for more than two minutes. And there are still two pilots aboard every passenger flight because of the need for a failsafe in unanticipated circumstances and psychological reasons.  But perhaps the single biggest reason why automated passenger flights will not be happening anytime soon is that passenger aircraft need a dedicated commander to make decisions on behalf of the passengers. There's simply no technological way to get around the need for a commander to be on the flight."

Those technologies are from 1950's.  but you're right, there will always be at least one person sitting in the cockpit making sure nothing goes wrong.  Just like in a fully automated factory, you still have someone to push the red button in case of emergency.   Also, you've hit on the point of Vectors, the reason they have those is to Automate things for general traffic.  When you flying Helicopters, you can be in either (G) unregulated, or E or any other air spaces. That's why I do believe heli will be the last one to go fully automated, however, in cases where Rapid transfer is required of a Medivac from a danger zone, Robots will be doing that, or Remote."

The Army sims are not utilized 100% and most of the instructors are retired pilots and will get you in for a fam flight and some will even teach you.

While we were doing some pedal turns, the tower forgot about us and cleared a Southwest Jet to take off from the opposite end of our runway. We noticed it when it was about halfway down the runway, pulled power and got off to the side of the runway a few seconds before it was over where we were hovering. Jet pilot came over the air angrily asking if he just missed a helicopter, tower frantically apologized saying he forgot where we were, new voice comes onto tower and re routes everyone, and my instructor as PIC had to make a phone call and do whatever.

I'm impressed you had the presence of mind to get the PCLs off so fast.  What was the conversation like among the crew after the crash?  I assume you weren't up ICS on the way to the hospital.

Helicopters,2jic5b,lowflier,2,Fri Oct 24 20:30:05 2014 UTC,"The other pilot took off his helmet, threw it at the ground, pointed back at the powerlines and said ""I must have flown over those more times than I can count.""    We didn't really get to say much after that because one of the crewmen realized his back had been really messed up in the crash so he laid down hoping to not mess it up more.  At that point I grabbed another member of the crew to help me get the litter out of our wing aircraft which had landed nearby to check for survivors.  We got the crewman on the litter, loaded up in the other helo and flew straight to the helipad at the local hospital.  We weren't up ICS for that flight, and once we got to the ER we were all split up while they ran X-rays, tests, etc."

Helicopters,2jic5b,secretgspot,3,Sat Oct 18 05:28:08 2014 UTC,"Dude.... you need to go get retraining or AT LEAST go to the safety course at Robinson.  In the R22 you have less than 1.5 seconds to react to an engine failure before your blades stall out. If you have a hard time comprehending that, that's just about the time it takes for you to take your hands away from the radio knob back to the collective.   You're attitude is going to kill you one day. Assuming you'll be fine as long as you don't do the exact wrong thing is what's gonna do you in. The FAA even found out that a lot of accidents are due to pilots not doing the proper emergency procedures at the right time. Your the pilot in command and part of that means you know how to fly the aircraft and are knowledgeable on the emergency procedures.   The fact that you're relying on ""Small Heli and Airplanes are built light and designed to glide at a reasonable speed"" is sickening. It's a disgrace to any effort a CFI has put into his or her student to maybe, one day, handle an emergency successfully."
Helicopters,2jic5b,zippyajohn,1 point,Sun Oct 19 03:41:06 2014 UTC,"do I really have to mention entire autorotation procedure? and isn't it why you constantly train for engine fail and such so it becomes a reflex?  Col down, Aft cycl, right pedal, adjust rpm..  point is, if you're flying, you SHOULD know these procedures by instinct.  I dunno why you're grilling me on this.   When all I said is, in normal conditions, it's hard to have a fatality.  Meaning if you do your Carb check, don't fly over-weight and also feel how bird is performing.     I can tell you when the belts are too tight or too loose just by the way it sounds inside of a cockpit.  It gets a bit harder if you fly different birds all the time.   and in R22, you have about till that red line at 90 before you're un-recoverable.  And dunno how retarded you gotta be to take more than a sec to reduce your collective.   My left hand is ALWAYS on the collective. http://www.copters.com/mech/pictures/R22_tach.jpg"
Helicopters,2jic5b,secretgspot,3,Sun Oct 19 03:51:54 2014 UTC,"Belts stay at 900lbs-1200lbs. ""The way it sounds"" has nothing to do with how tight the belts are.  Every helicopter pilot EVER is taught the blades stall at 80%+1%/1000ft DA. Realistically, your blades can go lower than that by up to 3-5% (obviously you shouldn't rely on that). Below 90% is the power-off rotor rpm limitation via the POH.  If you've ever had a student or even a COMMERCIAL student, you've had to lower the collective to maintain Nr multiple times.  you should try instructing sometime."

Helicopters,2j8sgu,iamkokonutz,2,Tue Oct 14 19:58:56 2014 UTC,I'm relatively excited. Did all of our hovering and taxiing on my own today. With that being said I'm going up this evening for an hour and that will be a lot more of an eye opener.
Helicopters,2j8sgu,prometheus5500,1 point,Tue Oct 14 20:06:28 2014 UTC,"Wait... You hovered first try? Or, you mean he let you try to hover?  I've always wondered if a kid could be amazing at video games, and have that translate into being able to hover at an advanced pace. I bet with Oculus Rift, hover times will drop in the future."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,Healbeam,3,Tue Oct 14 20:24:17 2014 UTC,"wondered if a kid could be amazing at video games, and have that translate into being able to hover at an advanced pace   I've flown sims since I was little. I then got my fixed-wing PPL, then took an intro flight so see what rotors are like. After a short flight, we came back to the airport for some hovering and set-downs. The CFI was stunned when he handed me all of the controls and I was fine. I did several set-downs and lift-offs (lift-offs were the hardest for me, as knowing where the 'balance' is can be tricky, since there are almost no indicators prior to hanging from the rotor).    He even told me that some schools have an area where, at the end of the first lesson, if the student can stay in it for 30 seconds in a hover, the first lesson is free. He said I would have done it just fine (damn them for not doing this! I want my free lesson!)    Sims are only getting better and more accurate. Although you're not wrong about the oculus helping, personally, I think it's the ever-improving flight models that will and are making the largest differences.    Same story for my PPL and IFR (although I'm not 100% through my IFR yet). All of my sim time set me up to complete everything in nearly minimum time with very little ground school. All my instructors have really had to do was bring in a few real-life changes to my already decent set of skills and habits I'd established as being a realism-based flight simmer."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,prometheus5500,2,Wed Oct 15 00:56:37 2014 UTC,"Wow. You're the first person to say that. Everyone else I heard said  Oh, you're a flightsimmer? Forget about it. Entirely. You'll kill yourself in real life because too many bad habits from games remain forever."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,Deltasteve,2,Wed Oct 15 15:54:56 2014 UTC,"And that is something to be thoughtful about. If you treat your flight sim time as ""game"" time, then sure. However, if you take it seriously, it really can be of benefit, especially for fixed wing, and doubly so for IFR.    The key, I think, is to approach flying as ""I have no idea, I've never done this"" even though you have a ton of experience in the sim. It's sort of like having a lot of pedal bike experience, then going to learn a motorcycle. Many principles and things you've learned apply, but MUCH will be different and need rework. Ask your instructor about habits you've developed in the sim, rather than assuming it's ok.    The way I see it, the more you can slam aviation down your throat, so long as you're doing it cautiously and consciously (no ""game"" time), the better. They used to teach arm-chair flying. Now, we get sims. Same idea, 1000 times better!    Fly safe.    PS: Although I was able to hover first try, I don't doubt that helicopters are far more dangerous when it comes to assuming you know what you're doing based on flight sim, as there are many ways to get into trouble in helicopters that are only recently being added to helicopter simulators, and they certainly aren't perfect. I would recommend simming for fixed wing much more than I would for helicopter... but... I also feel like I started ahead of the curve with my sim experience. That sim experience just needs to be taken with a grain of salt... maybe a pile of salt for helicopters..."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,iamkokonutz,1 point,Thu Oct 16 05:41:03 2014 UTC,"This is dependent on the flight simulator. The UH60 simulator is terrible, to be honest. Sure, it's great for instrument procedures and practicing EP's that would normally damage the ACFT, but using it to hover? That's a good joke there.  Edit: words mean things."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,_--_-___--,1 point,Wed Oct 22 16:25:42 2014 UTC,Hovered first try.  I've got 245 hours in my fixed wing log book. It's a bit more busy but the basics remain the same as what I've read. Tail rotor is counter torque. Just light adjustments.

Helicopters,2j8sgu,iamkokonutz,1 point,Tue Oct 14 20:44:58 2014 UTC,"Over the years I had maybe a hand full of people who would actually hold a reasonable hover with all controls during their 30 or 60 minute intro flight. Most were fairly seasoned fixed wing pilots, one guy just flew a lot of RC.   OP starting in the 269 rather than a 22 helps, too."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,_--_-___--,2,Tue Oct 14 20:55:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the 22 is a twitchy lil guy. I personally love flying them, although I know they get a lot of hate for their low inertia rotor.   But realistically, if I had to learn all over again, I'd learn on a 269/300 or a Bell 47 with a substantial amount of R44 time for good measure and job prospects."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,_--_-___--,2,Tue Oct 14 20:58:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the R22 is not a great initial training aircraft, but you gotta train in whatever gives you the best chances at finding a job. In the U.S. that is the 22, in Canada probably 44/206. In Australia I'd go 22/44."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,hyperbolicsquid,2,Tue Oct 14 21:01:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Cattle muster down there for sure. What do they use the R22 for in the US? Or is that because most pilots build time being a CFI in the US?  Up here, ENG and powerline/pipeline patrol is a common first job for building hours. Couple tour operators use R44's and low hour pilots. They have to sell tours and fly them. They eat what they kill, but that's rare from what I know around here."
Helicopters,2j8sgu,_--_-___--,3,Tue Oct 14 21:04:34 2014 UTC,"Instruction in the U.S. It's by far the most common way to get to your first 1000 down there, and the R22 is still the most common machine used for it. Since it is tricky-ish to fly, most companies that hire low timers want them to have a significant amount of R22 time. There is also the whole SFAR73 issue, which requires low time instructors to have at least 50hrs (as far as I remember) in Robinson helicopters.  For Australian newcomers, they are almost guaranteed to either go mustering in a 22 or fly tourists in circles in a 44. The mustering game is kind of its own world, but again you want a fair bit of 22 time to get a start."

Helicopters,2j8sgu,secretgspot,0,Wed Oct 15 16:41:12 2014 UTC,"I hovered first try at it. I had flown a little cross country stuff, but 90% straight and level with a couple approaches. Then we went out and did some hover work.  We progressed through the controls one at a time and then two at a time. He gave me all three and I was able to keep it pretty steady in a 10' box. It wasn't the most majestic piece of flying, but it wasn't too bad.  I've been flying on a sim for the last while and I think that helped out a ton. I never would have been able to keep my feet coordinated enough to hover without the sim. It helped knowing that my footwork was my weak spot, too.

But, you won't be able to fly anyone, and you still will need 200 PIC hours and Safety Course from Robinson before you're legally can carry passengers, or before you'll be insured.  I would call few schools and ask them how much and how long to get Private in Helicopters and what restrictions come with it.   As for crossing borders, no big deal, file flight plan and off you go, same way you cross regular border, but this time you'll land in nearest airport where Customs are available, they'll check you out and you get to use Pilot lounge"
Helicopters,2isakq,MastBumper,3,Thu Oct 9 19:22:46 2014 UTC,"As pointed out below by /u/zippyajohn, this information is incorrect. I got my PPL this summer in an r22. Upon completing the checkride the DPE said the typical ""license to learn"" thing and then asked who my first passenger was going to be.  I have taken several up since then and I have less than 200 Hrs. I also haven't taken the Robinson Safety Course (although I'd like to).   With a PPL you can fly any helicopter under 12,500 lbs excluding the r22 and r44, which require special training (SFAR 73). The time requirements are escaping me right now but it is significantly less than 200 Hrs."

As a private pilot you can fly passengers under 200 hours and without the safety course.    Note: I have not flown in a handful of years so those would be some big changes if that truly is the case today."
Helicopters,2isakq,secretgspot,-5,Thu Oct 9 21:35:58 2014 UTC,"you can't fly anyone.  Because Insurance will not cover you, it's pretty expensive to die from an Air crash.  Lets say you get your Private, where do you get a helicopter?  Rent it from school, only will cover you since you're a student and other students/pilots from same school.  Sometimes they will allow you to fly with other pilots as long as they know them.    Have your own helicopter? Once again, insurance is going to be a bitch to cover you and any of your passengers in the even of death.   For that, Robinsons recommends to complete 200 PIC hours and a Safety course before you start flying anyone other than yourself.     I got my PPL and CPL 5 years ago, that's how it was for me.  It was a nightmare, and I still haven't flown any of my family, they sort of got over the hype after 100 hours.   I would check with local school to see if it's still the same"

CPL is for middle class who wants to work in the industry and have perhaps friends in high places that are able to secure a job at low hours.  I had few friends go from training straight to working, they paid for 200 hours and got the job.   But that's very very very rare.   Most will not hire you till you get 1500 PIC hours.  And to get that, unless you're rich and willing to spend 250000+ on training, you must become a CFI, (flight instructor) and be a slave to it until you gain enough hours to get another position.   Like I said, after all my time, I still haven't flown my family, just few friends during training since my friend was a pilot also in the same school.   Maybe that should be your bell,   Pick your specialty right now, talk to bosses of those fields and see where those services would require, go train in that and have a guarantee of a job once you done training.   There are Heli wire pullers, Heli Wire inspectors, Heli Gold search, Heli Hunting, Heli Agriculture, Heli tourism... and so on, but most fields are very tight knit and all those old school farts that came out of Vietnam era do not want to give them up at no cost.    Soon, they'll be forced to since most of them are near the age of limitation.     My biggest fear is that by the time all those good positions open up, automation will be in full swing and pilots (humans) will no longer be required."

One more system to fail and in the event of mechanical failure or combat damage, one more thing to remember to do.  Also, they can't seriously be suggesting single engine.  As a lift platform it looks sufficient, but as an attack platform it needs a lot of work. What they show there has far less capability than what an AH64 or even an AH1 brings to the table.   My concern here is that this becomes another F35, half assing it's way into many roles and excelling at none of them."

I think it is unfair to compare it to the F35, which was designed to excel at every attribute. You finally have an aircraft designed to excel at primarily one attribute, high speed, but are unhappy with its lack of other abilities. This is ironically the same mistake made with the F35.  Edit: also, the S-97 is intended to replace the Kiowa fleet. So you're comparing it to attack helicopters that it isn't primarily aimed at replacing. It is designed to be excellent at the light scout / attack role, not the heavy attack, so I don't really see the problem."

I've been a big fan of coaxial helicopters for a while and think they fit the bill on the next generation of rotary wing.   Regarding the article, this is the segment that really stood out to me:    The JMR-TD is the precursor to the army's estimated USD100 billion Future Vertical Lift (FVL) programme, which is meant to eventually replace the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.   There are distinct roles that utility and attack helicopters fill. While you can do both in one airframe (UH-1M) there are always trade-offs. Try and fit too many good ideas in one machine and no one wins. I understand overall cost savings, but what's the problem with maintaining separate Utility and Attack roles?"
Helicopters,2ioslk,LittleUrbanAchiever,2,Wed Oct 8 20:19:41 2014 UTC,"The cost is in maintenance, if you can get rid of two platforms for one, think of all the parts that don't need to be ordered seperately, you can just keep a stock of wheels, rotor blades, windshields, widgets, what-have you's that fit all of your aircraft, instead of keeping a stock for four different airframes.  Outside of that, I'm with you, a phone that thinks its a computer is not nearly as efficient as having a phone that works as a phone, and a computer you can use to do computer things with.

On the same token, I'm not a fan of flying a rotorcraft with terrible autorotation abilities, if any.  If somebody else wants to, be my guest... but if the top speeds, weight capacity, service ceilings, range, and costs are similar, why not go for the coaxial over the tilt rotor?"
Helicopters,2ioslk,JeffreyDudeLebowski,2,Thu Oct 9 15:58:04 2014 UTC,The reason the v-22 has such horrible autorotation characteristics is that they limited the length of the rotor blades so the whole thing could fold up and take up less space on ships.

Helicopters,2icz2a,Aicisgod89,5,Sun Oct 5 14:57:56 2014 UTC,"Fly a Robinson.  No matter what.  Don't even get an hour in a 300 to feel it out.  Pilots who want to be employed learn in a Robinson.  It is the most common trainer out there by probably a 30-1 margin.  I understand you want to be an Army aviator and if that works out it won't matter what you trained in.  However, If you trained in an S300 and the military route doesn't work out you have hamstrung yourself into working at one of the few schools still teaching in an S300.  As for the MYTH that Robinsons are somehow less safe than the S300, or that they are in any way inferior... it's not rooted in fact.  here are the facts: Fatals R22 and 206 series are tied, 18 fatals each. 269/300 w/ 8 369/500 w/ 8 Bell 47 w/ 7 R44 w/5  Mechanical Failures 206 w/18 369/500 w/13 269/300 w/11 B47 w/11 R22 w/5 R44 w/1  Pilot Errors R22 w/140 206 w/115 269/300 w/68 B47 w/53 369/500 w/45 R44 w/17  Undetermined 206 w/10 269/300 w/8 369/500 w/ 6 B47 w/6 R22 w/5 R44 w/0  Engine Failure 369/500 w/8 206 w/7 B47 w/3 269/300 w/2 R22 w/1 R44 w/0  Total accidents R22 w/151 206 w/150 269/300 w/89 B47 w/73 369/500 w/72 R44 w/18  as you can see above more pilots have died in the R22 than in the S300 that is true... but there are also FAR more of them flying around, and most accidents are attributed to pilot error.  That is a pilot problem, not an aircraft problem.  As you can see by the above statistics you are FAR and I mean... FAR more likely to suffer a mechanical failure or an outright engine failure in an S300 or a 206 than you are in any Robinson product.  I have over 1000 hours in Robbies and I've experienced only 3 minor incidents.  a governer failure, alternator failure, and a misfiring cylinder.  Anyone who tells you to fly a 300 is doing you a great disservice.  All that said... the most important thing to know before you head down this road is this:  your job interview has already started.  good luck!  EDIT: the above data comes from: NTSB probable cause report Jan 99- Dec 03. so it' a little outdated but it gives you a good safety snapshot."
Helicopters,2icz2a,amnhanley,3,Sun Oct 5 20:24:32 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what way this would sway the data but did you include the TH-55? Other than the early models that tucked inverted in autos, the Army used them to train thousands of pilots for decades. I wouldn't ever argue that the 300 is more reliable than the R-22 but it's a more survivable airframe if you're going to hit the deck. The CBi's seem pretty reliable but I don't know if there are that many out there. You can severely pancake a 300 into the dirt and have a good chance at not being cremated by avgas. The higher rotor intertia and controls are also preferable to flight training. Most of the 300's out there are fuel injected also which is more difficult to start but safer in low power settings. All that said, I agree, don't do your training in one because you're totally screwed if you don't get hired your school."

Flying r22 is like riding moped, once you get used to it and it becomes an extension of your body, you really get to have fun with it.   On the other hand, I really worry about it being semi-ridgit VS fully articulated like the s300/s350.  and I like the way cbi looks vs large top fin on robinsons.   in my opinion, it doesn't matter if he learns in r22 or s300, both of them are piston engines, and both will benefit him in transition to turbine that they use in the army.   Type is just that, you want your rating, he needs his Private first and then Commercial as he's building up hours.  on a side note.  I would really love to get my hands on Cabri G2"

Most are forced to go Private, Commercial, CFI and teach for few years until they get enough hours, then usually promoted to the regular pilot who no longer trains students and so on.....     before tuna boats would take pilots with 200 hours, fresh out of Commercial license.  Insurances changed all that.   also, cost to go from 0 to cpl is around $100,000, and pay when you start is almost zero if not minimum wage.  Why? because everyone is selling themselves for free just to build any air time.   It's a very cut throat business unless you got good connections.  I wouldn't go to California since it's all Flat, Expensive and sea level. Basic training, you want somewhere extreme and far away from society.  Mountains or desert, those two will benefit you the most.  I've got all of my training flying 3000 MSL and in mountains,  when boys from California come here, they freak out with the 200 micro climates we have here.  Upon getting your Private license which can be done at 40 hours, you're only permitted to fly on your own, you're still prohibited to carry passengers.   When you get your CPL at 80 or so, you can carry passengers as long as they are part of aviation, otherwise insurance won't cover it, and you cannot carry any other passengers until you have 200 hours AND have passed  Robinson factory training.   In my case I was unable to get a visa to the States again at at time and ended up flying Frank over here to gives me and few other the training and certificates.   @Amnhanley  that course is REQUIRED and you cannot get insured without it flying Robinson"
Helicopters,2icz2a,c5load,3,Sun Oct 5 22:42:30 2014 UTC,"BEFORE you use your hard-earned GI bill benefits on flight school, apply for the WOFT program FIRST. Why waste it if you'd get accepted before?  The Army will teach you to fly. Even with zero flight experience. As a vet, you already have a leg up on other civilian applicants.. Having your CPL will give you a leg up on radio calls and not much else.  Incompetent people don't belong in Army Aviation. Those people (<5%) don't make it, and most of those are people with integrity violations and idiots. Very few fail out for flight related issues.  Apply first."
Helicopters,2icz2a,c5load,2,Sun Oct 5 21:13:33 2014 UTC,It's probably not a bad idea for him to at least log a few hours to see if flying is really what he thinks it is.
Helicopters,2icz2a,c5load,3,Sun Oct 5 21:53:08 2014 UTC,"Use a discovery flight for that, not GI Bill benefits."
Helicopters,2icz2a,JeffreyDudeLebowski,2,Sun Oct 5 21:54:33 2014 UTC,I'm not sure that a few flights are going to simulate what being a professional pilot is like. My last unit was an Air Assault Sqn and talking to the pilots about long hours and shitty conditions makes me hesitant to think flying will be always be fun.
Helicopters,2icz2a,longbowfosho,3,Sun Oct 5 22:15:14 2014 UTC,"The vast majority of us military pilots had no prior flight experience. The overwhelming majority. I don't remember the exact figure, but licensed pilots make up something like <5% of us.  And being a professional civilian pilot and a military pilot are absolutely nothing alike."
Helicopters,2icz2a,USCAV19D,1 point,Sun Oct 5 22:35:03 2014 UTC,"I just remember sitting behind a gun for hours at a time and being tired and uncomfortable with stress thrown in the mix. I wanted to be a diver for a while and enjoyed scuba, but I got a chance to hang out with some commercial divers and found out I don't enjoy working underwater with zero visibility. I'm just very curious to feel what it's like to fly under similar conditions that you would experience."
Helicopters,2icz2a,USCAV19D,3,Sun Oct 5 22:50:25 2014 UTC,"That's just the thing though.. as a civilian pilot, the chances of you operating under NVGs, flying NOE, multi ship formation, carrier landigs,and getting to blow stuff up are slim to none. The two just don't compare.  I totally understand you wanting to see if flying a helicopter is your thing. It is. Trust me.  There was not a single person on our first flights who regretted their career choice."

Helicopters,2icz2a,amnhanley,3,Wed Oct 8 20:29:50 2014 UTC,"To piggyback onto what /u/c5load was saying, you could actually get your CPL and you're still going to be totally unprepared for military aviation. They simply don't compare. We have guys come in with CPL and CFII (both fixed and rotary wing) who take just as long to make PIC as everyone else simply because it's a totally different profession. You know this from being prior military already. I've looked at civilian jobs after my time is done, but I'm terrified of being bored out of my mind just buzzing around from Point A to Point B, even if I'm making good money. The Army life may not be my style, but the flying sure is.  That being said, I agree with whoever said a discovery flight is the best plan of action for you. Don't waste your GI Bill on a CPL and then waste it by getting in the military. You're prior enlisted, so you've already got a leg up on a lot of WOFT applicants. If you have college and you do well on the aptitude test (whatever it's called now), you're practically a shoo-in if the Army needs you.  TL; DR  Either get your CPL or apply for the Warrant program in the Army. Using your GI Bill benefits for a CPL to pursue an Army career is a waste IMO.  If you want to know more about being a warrant officer, PM me or any of the many others on here.  Good luck!"
Helicopters,2icz2a,TurdFlight85,2,Sun Oct 5 23:34:28 2014 UTC,"The Army has a knack for taking even the most fun thing and making it suck.  I'm in your boat right now. I'm a former active duty 19D that is currently doing a WOFT packet. It's a pain in the butt, but honestly just being a vet really is a huge leg up.  Do your shit, but submit your packet after November. The less competition I have the better!"

Helicopters,2i3wed,time2getout,10,Thu Oct 2 17:27:19 2014 UTC,"Current crew chief on the platform, according to the NATOPS, yes.    ""The high disk loading and low inertia of the rotor make successfully concluding an autorotation more challenging than in a helicopter"" 11-41 of our NATOPS under VTOL Autorotation, further down the page when discussing technique developed after flight testing it says: ""Because the low inertia rotors store little energy, they will only slightly reduce sink rate at touchdown; a a flare and deceleration to 60 KCAS is the primary means of arresting sink rate.  In simulations, the outcome of the landings varied widely due to the extreme sensitivity to pilot technique and timing.""  In summary, yes but if you have altitude to spare just shoot an ELP in APLN mode."
Helicopters,2i3wed,conaan,6,Thu Oct 2 23:27:01 2014 UTC,"""In simulations, the outcome of the landings varied widely due to the extreme sensitivity to pilot technique and timing.""   Sounds like unless you're Igor Sikorsky himself, you would ball it up."

Helicopters,2i3wed,KillerRaccoon,9,Wed Oct 15 06:31:07 2014 UTC,"No, they transition to forward flight configuration and glide to a landing. The rotors are too light to support efficient autorotation. The rotors are destroyed as they strike the ground, though. However, if only one engine loses power (which is what I'm guessing happened here, as the pilot regained control and landed at a land base. If it had been a proprotor gearbox failure, he would have had no power and would have had to try to set it down in the drink), a driveshaft that links the nacelles can split the power of the remaining engine, allowing a slow flight to base, landing in forward flight mode and destroying the rotors.  pertinent wiki link"
Helicopters,2i3wed,OhHeyHey,4,Thu Oct 2 18:10:53 2014 UTC,"To split hairs, they CAN autorotate, but as the wiki says, performance is poor.  It's a low-inertia rotor system, so they don't have much to work with to soften the landing.  As you mentioned, transitioning to get lift on wings and gliding to a landing is the way to go if the altitude is available."

Helicopters,2i3wed,1mfa0,2,Thu Oct 2 19:04:43 2014 UTC,"All my bros from helo pilot training ask me this all the time.  I have pulled it off several times in the old simulator but mostly from high level and I had a good inclination it was gunna get thrown at me by an ip...unfortunately I rarely employ this aircraft at 2000ft.  That being said the chances of loosing both engines are super slim and we generally have OEI for Conv mode at most locations and weights we operate at, but yea transition out if ya can. But it's not at all like a Huey, In this thing it is an all out last ditch maneuver which you do your best to be able to survive."
Helicopters,2i3wed,Zoomie119,2,Fri Oct 3 05:40:32 2014 UTC,So when OEI do you dudes just come in with the nacelles like halfway up and as much airspeed as you can get? I can't imagine you can come to a hover right? I understand if this isn't public forum knowledge.
Helicopters,2i3wed,P38sheep,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:03:18 2014 UTC,Uh I think it's fine to say we calc OEI for airplane mode as well as at 60 deg nacelle and in that situation you would fly to a run way for a roll on landing.  Towards the bottom of the approach you rotate nacelles and roll on at like 75ish degrees.
Helicopters,2i3wed,Autorotator,2,Tue Oct 7 06:47:35 2014 UTC,The new aw609 is supposed to have great auto performance for what it's worth. So this might only be a v22 thing and not a powered lift problem.
Helicopters,2i3wed,Rispetto,1 point,Wed Oct 15 06:33:53 2014 UTC,"No, and the statistical probability of both engines failing in one flight is less than the accident rate of failed necessary autorotations.  Or so I was told by a former neighbor and Bell engineer."
Helicopters,2i3wed,Autorotator,1 point,Thu Oct 2 17:31:04 2014 UTC,"I would not call a ""failed necessary autorotation"" an ""accident"".  Accident implies that there was nothing the pilot could have possibly done to successfully autorotate, whilst ""failed"" in the same sentence implies otherwise."
Helicopters,2i3wed,Rispetto,3,Thu Oct 2 17:41:47 2014 UTC,Okay however you want to phrase it.  The probability of dying in a necessary autorotation is higher than the probability of both engines failing.

Helicopters,2hwwgy,DTrain13,2,Tue Sep 30 18:36:22 2014 UTC,"Vocational Rehab?  If so flight schools are going to be drooling over you. Anyway, anything below 1500 hours and you're more than likely looking at instructing. Anything less than 1000 and you're basically either instructing or leaving the business. I'll tell you what I know but it's 5 years out of date. Before 2008, things were looking really good, lots of students and they were getting financing without too much trouble. A fast growing bubble of a school called Silver State Helicopters would soon ruin that for everyone when it popped (I think in January 2008) and then the recession happened. Students still had money left and things kept going along for a while but there was an excess of CFI's from Silver State and the # of financed students dropped dramatically. Ever since that the whole low time segment of the industry has basically been held together by veterans using their GI Bills for helicopter training. CFI positions are very competitive naturally and this just made it worse. I guess the die hard guys that are sticking it out must have gotten 2nd jobs or something. From what I can tell, not much has changed but maybe if the economy picks up and the financed students come back, it might be a little more promising. Another thing to consider is whether or not the supply of GI Bill students will decrease with OIF over and OEF (maybe) winding down. With that you also could expect some of the military pilots to scoop up the EMS and Gulf of Mexico jobs.  I hope some other guys chime in with more recent experience about the current state of the industry because I've been trying to figure this out myself so I can decide whether or not to keep my desk job or go and try to slog it out again with my lowly 500 hours. It can be hard to get a clear answer because flight schools aren't usually going to be straight with you, so you have to put together clues from job postings and what not. I've found a couple industry outlook reports that project growth but I'm still very cautious about believing it. It is worth mentioning that there have been a noticeable amount of EMS job postings in the last 6 months for 2000-2500 hour pilots but that's a very tough place to get to when you're new.

Helicopters,2hk7fl,Dinnerz58,3,Fri Sep 26 20:45:10 2014 UTC,Why is there a pilot station in the back left??  Long line?
Helicopters,2hk7fl,zippyajohn,3,Sat Sep 27 03:26:39 2014 UTC,Training. In the front there is only a single seat so the training captain has to use the original pilots seat (As in the original Hillers that only has single row of seats)
Helicopters,2hk7fl,Slattz,2,Sat Sep 27 09:52:43 2014 UTC,The original hiller was desinged with center seat as pilots seat.  The left seat controls in the 3 seat hiller are slaves.
Helicopters,2hkfuw,Av619,5,Fri Sep 26 22:08:15 2014 UTC,"Your options are   a) Military  b) come up with the 75k somehow  I can tell you right now that it will be easier and safer and cheaper to save up the money first, rather than getting a loan. The loan will cost you interest, it will put you under pressure if you can't immediately find a job after training, and most importantly: it's easier to save up 75k now than it is trying to repay a 75k loan on a low time pilots wages. A lot easier.   Patience and persistence is the key. That includes having to save up some money for a few (or a lot of) years. My advice would be to find a better paying non-flying job and start saving.  Paying for lessons from your current salary is not a good idea either, if you don't fly at least twice a week or so, you'll forget half of what you learned and end up spending more money on the whole thing."

Plan B: He fails and can fall back on his current well paying job."
Helicopters,2hkfuw,typical_thatguy,1 point,Fri Sep 26 23:33:23 2014 UTC,"Yep, this is a good idea. Taking a loan is a big risk, and it's hard to come by these days, especially if you're current income isn't great.  I took out a giant home equity loan, so the interest rate was pretty good. I also had some another person on the loan so I would have a bit of help (If I needed it, I never did) but it helped take the pressure off me. Granted, I worked my ass off, lived SUPER cheap and paid as much as I could towards the thing, but it wasn't exactly a ""If I miss a payment my life is over"" type of thing either."
Helicopters,2hkfuw,Azhigher,2,Sat Sep 27 01:37:58 2014 UTC,"That flight training loan is almost 30% interest? That is ridiculous man, especially with a 4 year loan. Obviously you can't afford the repayments because well 2,000 * 12 = 24,000 which is, as I'm sure you know, over your net income.  If you save up 1,000 a month you'll have your 75k in 6 years. It's long but, I'm not sure about the US military, but 4 years is how long you have to be in the military for and I imagine you don't want to do that. So you could do it over that period and have the money in 6 and a bit years.  If you can obviously go higher than 1,000 a month then it'll take less, 1500 will bring it down to 4 years."

Helicopters,2hj8d7,multicactus,6,Fri Sep 26 15:17:01 2014 UTC,"For me I can say very rarely does thought of catastrophic failure come to mind, as in every part of life there are things that you just cannot control.  Unlike Holly Wood depiction helicopters do not typically just fall appart and explode.  If you frequently have  fear or concern for catastophic failures then I would think very long and deeply about  becoming a pilot, it might not be the right fit for you. I dont mean that to be harsh but constant worry shouldn't be there.  A healthy cautious approach and respect for the machine is good but being overly worried could lead to poor aeronautical decision making.  I fly both fixed wing and rotary wing. Helicopters are more fun but more work, fixed wing is better quality of life and potentially better pay in the long run.  My training is mostly Army so I didn't pay for it (well monitarly anyways). I've had forced landings in helicopters and airplanes, it's not if it's when. You just go back to your training and follow checklists and do the best with what ya got.  The outcome will be what it is."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,J_Tomonaga,2,Fri Sep 26 16:11:58 2014 UTC,"I'd like to just add a point to this. As a passenger you might want to start learning how the helicopter really works.   When you understand all the systems at play, their redundancies and various backups, you start to understand that there really are very few ""random"" catastrophic failures. Bird strike removed, all those other things have already been planned for in TBO and Life Limited Parts. Anything truly ""random"" should get picked up by a 50/100 hr and/or pre-flight. Diligence in listening for those ""new"" sounds during startup, is key. Anything that gets past all of that, well you've been trained as a pilot to handle those emergencies as well.  Also keep in mind, you're talking about machines that have been in service, in some cases, for almost 30 years. I feel you can find a variety of mid-to-late 70s model year Bell 206s which all still work like new, for instance. Point being, if they haven't ""randomly failed catastrophically"" in 30 years..."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,achemze,5,Tue Sep 30 23:52:57 2014 UTC,How is an event outside your control any different in an aircraft than out of one?  I could be hit by a drunk driver tonight.  I could slip on a wet floor and hit my head just right.  I could get cancer.  I could simply reach for my license in a way a cop doesn't like at be killed at gunpoint in a routine traffic stop. A meteorite could even take me out.  There's no point worrying about catastrophic component failure.  We will all die somehow.
Helicopters,2hj8d7,amnhanley,1 point,Fri Sep 26 16:17:23 2014 UTC,Well said.
Helicopters,2hj8d7,Azhigher,6,Sat Sep 27 01:43:53 2014 UTC,"I'll caveat this with the fact that I'm a military helo pilot so take this for what you will.  At this point in my career I have experienced pretty much every emergency listed as possible in our pubs, including one that was thought of as ""not possible.""  I have made emergency landings and one full blown ""I should be dead"" crash.  In every case the thing that saved me and my crew was knowing our procedures cold, and having an extensive knowledge of the systems to troubleshoot the important stuff as quickly as possible.  ""random catastrophic"" failures happen so rarely, that you might as well be worried about getting hit by a car and a bolt of lightning at the same time while sleeping in bed.  For everything else that will kill you, you will have a window of opportunity with which to asses the situation, determine your options, make a choice, and act on that choice.    I've never regretted my choice as I think flying a helicopter is the best job in the world, I've learned a ton from every event, and I've saved numerous lives.  In the end the hardest part was talking to my wife after my ""should be dead"" crash to get her thoughts on me continuing to fly.  Turns out, once she found out I was alive because of how we handled the aircraft in the crash, she was ok with it."

Helicopters,2hj8d7,carryonaye,2,Fri Sep 26 18:00:00 2014 UTC,"I actually experienced it twice.  According to the engineers its not supposed to be possible to have a total AC power failure because the system is triple redundant, with automatic load sharing, switching, and dropping.  Along with numerous fault detection failsafes, etc.  The reason it becomes a big deal and is triple redundant is because when it happens you lose all of the electronic flight assist functions, auto stabilator control, all of the nav, almost all lighting, and almost every flight and engine instrument including the Artificial Horizon.  (But somehow the warning horns telling you everything is disabled still work...go figure)  Well I had it happen twice, in two different aircraft, and both times at night.  The first was while flying low level through a mountain TERF route, as a section, on NVGs, with 0% illumination through a transition point.  (Basically the worst possible time with the worst combination of factors)        The second time it happened wasn't nearly as exciting."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,lowflier,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:51:12 2014 UTC,"Would you say that 27 years old is too old to try to fly for the Army? I desperately want to fly, but can't fathom how I'm going to afford it in the civilian world."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,RepostResearch,3,Fri Sep 26 20:25:49 2014 UTC,"Depends on the commissioning program restrictions.  I'm not sure what the Army's are, but for the Navy you can't be older than 27 by the time you commission if you want to be a pilot.  (Occasionally you can get a waiver up to 29, but I've only heard of it happening for prior enlisted transitions.)"
Helicopters,2hj8d7,lowflier,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:57:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I was looking at the Army for their warrant officer program (I don't have a 4 year degree). Having gone through the military route, would you suggest it over civilian training if possible?"
Helicopters,2hj8d7,RepostResearch,2,Fri Sep 26 21:02:08 2014 UTC,"Depends on your tolerance for bullshit.  Its great in that you get paid to learn how to fly, and then paid to fly.  I love flying the -60, and the jobs I get to do are awesome!  I love that I've had the ability to save lives, put out fires, employ weapons, etc.  But I hate the bureaucratic admin bullshit, and the time away from my family is getting old.  Everything has its plusses and minuses.  With that being said, if you want to get out and fly civilian after, there are differences that you will have to adapt to when you get out, you don't necessarily just walk in the door and start flying.  You have to take some equivalency tests to get things like your Commercial Cert, CFI, CFII, etc.  Not every military flying job qualifies you for equivalence testing either.  And just doing one tour will not give you enough flight time to really be competitive.  There are a lot of factors that play in.  What is your timeline, what are you goals, what kind of personality do you have, what are you willing to put up with, etc?"
Helicopters,2hj8d7,lowflier,2,Fri Sep 26 21:24:17 2014 UTC,"I've completely come to terms with the fact that I might die in a helicopter. I'm ok with that as long as its not pilot error, in other words my own fault for doing something wrong.    I do try to constantly be scanning for a landing spot if my engine quits.  And limit my exposure to time inside the height velocity diagram. Other then that its out of my control."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,mrhelio,2,Fri Sep 26 17:13:52 2014 UTC,"seems like nobody is answering #2  I paid for flight school.   Allot of people that didn't stay with the industry just had bad timing. This was back in 07 when the economy was going to crap, and the silver state helicopters fiasco went down. I was already a CFI and working at the school, we had a list of students who wanted to do training but nobody could get financing from the banks.   pretty much all the guys coming up after me got out of the industry.  So it was just bad timing for them.  I know this has been said before but flight schools are similar to a pyramid scheme. If an instructor need 5 students to fly 200 hours each each to make it to 1000 hours himself.  Then each of his students need 5 students each and so on.  Imagine what happens when suddenly none of the students can get student loans to pay for anything.    We had a few students who just didn't didn't have what it takes: abnormal reactions to stress... or terrible manners/personality. But they usually where weeded out before they got to PPL."
Helicopters,2hj8d7,mrhelio,1 point,Sat Sep 27 07:16:34 2014 UTC,3  Airplanes.... No thanks.  The route up to being a captain at a major airline or flying for Fedex  takes  decades. You can do it much faster in helicopters. There is way more variety in good jobs.  Plus airplanes just seem boring.... Wait for ever to taxi out and take off.  then turn on auto pilot after 60 seconds and then sit there for 3 hours till its time to land.  I feel really bad for those guys starting out in fixed wing that have to work for those terrible commuter airlines.  They are being taken advantage of in a bad way.  All that being said I would like to at least get my private fixed wing so I can rent planes to go on personal trips in.  Driving sucks! and helicopters are too expensive to rent.
Helicopters,2hj8d7,mrhelio,1 point,Sat Sep 27 07:26:05 2014 UTC,"1) Stop being a pansy 2) Lack of drive, no interest in earning a seat 3) Fixed wing is the most horrific form of transportation to ever be invented.  I'd rather be set on fire 4)Forced landing?  100% if you do it long enough  Die?  Something will kill you.  Might as well be having fun when it happens."

Helicopters,2h9v66,prometheus5500,1 point,Tue Sep 23 22:37:59 2014 UTC,"The San Diego Regional Fire Helicopter Program was running some training missions with their Bell 412  (Copter 2), on Monday, September 22nd in the early afternoon, on the coast of Carlsbad, CA.     Warm Waters, the area they are practicing in, is called warm waters because the power plant uses sea water to cool itself, and then pumps the warm water out between these two jetties, warming the surrounding waters, and creating the powerful ""river"" they are practicing in.    I happened to be viewing them from afar when I realized it was training, so I moved closer, then walked onto the beach. Upon noticing the fishers on the end of the jetty, I decided I'd join them directly in the action, as the firefighters clearly didn't care that they were there.      I've linked my favorite clip in the post, but as stated, I've got a few more.      First clip I took. This was during the first round of practice. I did not want to go out onto the jetty, as I was worried they would tell me to move, and I didn't want to be a bother.    Last clip (Can see the Rescuee enter water.) When they showed up for a second round of training, I noticed the fishers on the jetty had not been told to move, so I quickly scrambled out to get totally in the action with them.    Quite the thrilling day, considering I was just planning on sitting at the beach. Stoked to get an up-close and personal view of a rescue helicopter in action, especially with no lives actually in danger!    Keep flying safe up there!    Cheers.    Edit: Sorry for some of the shitty camera work. It was very bright, and as I was recording with an Ipad, I could hardly see the screen... plus I was trying to watch and enjoy..."

You can do the street-to-seat program where you join the Army with a specific contract to become a warrant officer and go to flight school. You'll rack up valuable hours in multi-million dollar airframes and fly important missions. Win-win.

Either way, there always have been more people that want to fly than there are suitable low-timer jobs. A lot more. The difference is that with the military route, you get paid, but your ass belongs to them for 8 years. With the civilian route, you are 80k out of pocket and the pay will be much less than the military for at least 5 years or so, but you won't get sent to assholistan.   Either way it's sacrifice compared to many other careers. You gotta really, really want it.  I did the civilian thing, but that was years ago. It worked out for me through determination and willingness to move wherever I needed to move (hint: if you have a mortgage and a couple of kids, this isn't a good idea), but I won't deny that there was also lot of ""right time, right place"" luck involved."

Helicopters,2h9fm2,ClayJay751,1 point,Wed Sep 24 20:53:49 2014 UTC,"Check any major helicopter forum (Vertical Reference, PPRune - rotorheads, etc), they all have long threads ""so you want to become a pilot"". It has also been discussed here many times.  Basically, the civilian route goes like this:  1) Save up $80k*  2) find a reputable flight school  3) research how good your chances of getting hired at said school are after your training. Ask around. Talk to current and former employees.  4) Do your training. You need to get a PPL(H) first, then CPL(H), probably with instrument rating, then CFI, then CFI-Instrument. All this should take around 200hrs of total flight time all things included, which is also the legal minimum to instruct in a Robinson Helicopter, and thus the minimum you need to get hired to do so. Ground school is usually done alongside your flight training.  5) Be on top of your game the whole time, always show up on time, always be prepared for every ground and flight lesson.  6) get hired and start building time.  As for the * at step 1), you could also get a loan for this. The problem is that this puts you at a disadvantage for step 6), since you will now have additional pressure to generate some income because your payments are coming due soon. Without the loan, you can go anywhere anytime and work for any amount of shit money as long as it is enough for food. Which could include part time gigs etc. With the loan, you are forced to find full time work to make the payments, and for many people that means having to go back to a non-flying job if they can't get a pilot job right away. And that takes you right out of the game and really minimizes your chances of ever finding a job. Seen this exact thing happen to many, many people.  The other thing about the loan is simple mathematics: Chances are that your current job makes you more money than any entry- or even mid-level flying job ever could. So it's easier to save money of your current income, than it is to make loan payments with interest on your possible future income."

I would have to get a loan. I'm going to treat this as my second option if the military thing doesn't work out. Hell, the odds are stacked against me at this point so I guess I better get saving."
Helicopters,2h9fm2,nightmarejetfuel,2,Thu Sep 25 04:13:41 2014 UTC,"At your age, the military is certainly the most viable option, if you have no objections to signing your life over to Uncle Sam until you're 30.   As for the civilian route (if you want to go that way): If you are truly dedicated to doing this, then you should first maximize your chances by applying some patience.   Get a well paying job or two, live cheap, resist buying that Mustang or signing that mortgage. Save up at least the majority of the 80k in the next 4-5 years (it might be a bit more than 80k by then). Then do your training with little or no debt."

Helicopters,2h9fm2,secretgspot,3,Fri Sep 26 04:49:22 2014 UTC,"What should you be looking for in a flight school? A reputable one thats not super small and has a long track record. If they have contracts to train foreign students all the better, that improves the chances of you getting a job as a flight instructor there when you're done with training.  Would it be better to get your private license first? Assuming you don't already have time in other aircraft, you're going to have to get your private before you get your commercial. You're not really losing money doing this, it' just how it's done. The nice thing is if you go through it all to get your private you can always really take a look at whether or not you still like it and think it's something you'd be comfortable doing for the rest of your working life.   Anything else you should know? I would read up on the FAQ's thats stickied at the top of this subreddit and get a good idea of where you want to end up and what your life is going to entail getting from where you are now, to there. If you go to flight school make sure you have all your funding in order and don't pay for all of your training up front. Pay as you go.  My pick of schools in San Diego would be Civic Helicopters.

Helicopters,2gkcwx,joshr03,8,Tue Sep 16 17:41:06 2014 UTC,"Fuel vapors can be ignited by a spark from a charge difference between the fuel truck/tank and the helicopter/airplane. All aircraft should be bonded to the fuel delivery system before any fuel is transferred. Bonding is similar to grounding, but lets the two equalize their charge so there is no spark, while grounding allows the spark to equalize to earth and ground out."
Helicopters,2gkcwx,Deltasteve,3,Tue Sep 16 17:52:41 2014 UTC,"It's to prevent any static sparks igniting fumes. Fluid moving through a line will build up static charge and can possibly discharge it when the line or fuel makes contact with the helicopter.

Helicopters,2gkcwx,mrimp13,3,Wed Sep 17 14:46:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, for cold pumps we would do it the way you described because according to ""the book"" bonding is more critical than grounding during a hot pump. It's actually not even required(at least by the USN) to ground the aircraft during hot pumps as long as the fueling source is bonded to the aircraft. Everyone still does it the ""old"" way though, I would be a little more uncomfortable if the aircraft wasn't grounded(even though the tail gear ""wick"" is there, that thing doesn't always reach the ground  depending how much it has worn down or how high the strut is serviced) during a hot pump."

Also, here's /u/nighthawke75 on /r/aviation with more details on the premature takeoff:   The ship was not at the proper launching speed or heading or they would not be wallowing around in the seas like that.   Also, the pilot was holding pitch on his collective, making the aircraft light on the skids.  When the ship pitched forward, the craft pitched forward, the pilot overcorrected and a tailrotor strike event occurred, damaging the TR blades and the TR driveline.    The pilot was able to cut power and zero out his pitch bringing the craft back down solid on the deck, but as you noted, the damage was already done, the craft's grounded until it can be serviced."

Helicopters,2fuxnb,Mike637,1 point,Tue Sep 9 04:18:02 2014 UTC,150 hours a year at active duty?
Helicopters,2fuxnb,annerajb,1 point,Wed Sep 10 18:50:39 2014 UTC,"Yes. I would assume the guard/reserves will be at similar levels as well. Even now, most of the guys I know end up with 1500-1700 hours at the end of their six year contract. That means an average of 250-283 hours a year and that includes at least one heavy flying year with a deployment."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,Mike637,2,Wed Sep 10 21:57:54 2014 UTC,"Most companies are hiring at 1500 to 1000 hours, EMS usually want more. I would definitely recommend going though. At a minimum you're getting an education that cost civilians $70,000 to $100,000; also if you go though the Guard you can still rack up a lot of flight time if you put the effort in."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,Potatoe_away,1 point,Tue Sep 9 04:28:43 2014 UTC,Isn't the minimum amount of hours required for a Guard Pilot to maintain proficiency around 50 hours a year? Wouldn't that mean that at a minimum you log 50 hours a year?
Helicopters,2fuxnb,annerajb,1 point,Wed Sep 10 18:52:07 2014 UTC,"Nope, same minimums as and active duty pilot. And unlike active duty, the AFTP program means you are guaranteed flight time."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,Potatoe_away,2,Wed Sep 10 19:11:07 2014 UTC,As other have said you would get a education that cost a lot on the civilian world.  If you are employed by federal law your employee must retain your job for 5 years and depending on your employee they may even pay the difference for the first 6 months of what you are loosing (if any) while being active duty to conduct NG training.  Additionally you would be paid as a Warrant which depending on how much you earn currently on your job it's a decent amount especially if you have TIS which you most likely have..

Helicopters,2fuxnb,amnhanley,3,Tue Sep 16 23:41:09 2014 UTC,"as a low time pilot you have 2 options.  get 200 hours including 50 hours in Robinsons.  I'd recommend a 25/25 split between the R22 and R44 so you can get an SFAR PIC endorsement and teaching endorsement in each.  Once you have those hours you are semi-employable.  You can either instruct if you are a CFII or you can fly tours for minimum wage in Florida.    once you hit 500 hours you CAN get a job at a small 135 operator or do some R44 tours in places like Vegas, New York, Myrtle Beach etc.  when you hit 1000 you can fly tours in the canyon or Alaska with one of the major tour ops flying Astars or A130s or B206s.    at 1500 you can work for PHI doing gulf work.  at 2000 with at least 500 turbine you can do EMS  from there you can pretty much break into whatever kind of heli job you want and you'll get paid reasonably well with a nice cushy schedule.  it's a long road.  I'm still climbing the ladder myself but I'm told the juice is worth the squeeze."

Helicopters,2fuxnb,amnhanley,2,Tue Sep 9 00:42:35 2014 UTC,"civilians fly a lot more than army pilots.  I have been flying since October 2011 and I'm at around 1100 hours.  Some guys accumulate hours faster, some slower.  I'd say my pace is just a hair above average in todays flight instructor/tour environment"
Helicopters,2fuxnb,KTBFFHCFC,2,Tue Sep 9 01:27:32 2014 UTC,"That isn't always the case. Perhaps civilians rack up more hours than the guard guys, but active duty on an overseas assignment (Korea, Germany, VIP missions) can rack up hours too. Also, deployments. I have known guys to come home with 1000+ for a 12 or 15 month deployment. Granted, that was at the peak of the war, but we're still deploying over there with fewer birds to cover all the missions."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,amnhanley,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:05:41 2014 UTC,"it's also not the norm.  WO's fly signifigantly more than officers of course but I know a Major with less than 400 hours and all he's ever been is a pilot. Fact is, deployments not withstanding, a lot of stateside soldiers would take 20 years to hit 1500 hours.  I mean the whats the pilot to helicopter ratio in the army..."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,JeffreyDudeLebowski,2,Wed Sep 10 09:40:16 2014 UTC,"A commissioned officers flight time is at it's most when they're PL's and company commanders. When they're on staff, they're only making FAC-2 minimums of 60 hours per year (that's for the UH-60). So, yes a commissioned officer can go 20 years and not see 1500 hours. The majority of warrants will spend most, if not all, of their career in a position that requires FAC-1 minimums of 96 hours per year. That's nearly 2000 hours in a 20 year career. Most will fly well above that. This is not taking into account deployments, JRTC/NTC/OPT/etc. rotations during which flight time will be much higher as well."
Helicopters,2fuxnb,POLLVX,1 point,Wed Sep 10 19:51:01 2014 UTC,"you would certainly know better than I would.  My numbers were clearly off a little but my original point stands the same I think.  Civilians fly a whole lot more throughout their careers.  If you fly only 96 hours a year as a commercial pilot you are probably an EMS pilot in a remote area of Kansas.  I'd say most pilots fly around 500-700 a year.  some more, some less.  It's tough to get an average but as a rule I would say civilians fly much more than military pilots."

Helicopters,2fmtfo,ThirdCocacola,3,Sat Sep 6 12:43:06 2014 UTC,What is VRS? Where there any passengers? Do we know the status on the pilot?
Helicopters,2fmtfo,Niatnuom,8,Sat Sep 6 14:22:37 2014 UTC,"VRS is vortex ring state. The helicopter gets caught in its own down wash and cannot power out of it, you just fall like that."
Helicopters,2fmtfo,vsTerminus,3,Sat Sep 6 14:26:20 2014 UTC,"Worth adding, perhaps, is that VRS can be prevented by adding collective before your descent rate gets out of control, and you can recover by giving it enough forward cyclic that the helicopter moves out of the downwash and into clean air (or lateral cyclic and pedal input in a multi-rotor heli)."
Helicopters,2fmtfo,achemze,3,Sat Sep 6 15:35:37 2014 UTC,"He might have lost cyclic authority before attempting to recover. If you don't drop that collective (which obviously didn't happen here), the vortices only get bigger."

Helicopters,2fmtfo,c5load,2,Sat Sep 6 21:57:55 2014 UTC,"And worth noting that if you're already established in VRS, pulling collective is actually going to increase the rate of descent.  And cyclic in any direction in a single engine will get you out of VRS."
Helicopters,2fmtfo,Suhweetusername,1 point,Sat Sep 6 21:35:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but I wonder if he had enough a altitude to recover. During a training flight in the Robbie I remember being stuck in a pretty high rate of decent for what seemed like an abnormally long time. If I were that close to the ground in that scenario, I would either have had just enough time to recover for a hard-ish landing or a complete impact with terrain.

The X-55 in particular is nice because you can remove the centering spring completely. That way you're not fighting the stick all the time, and your arm won't tire out.  You can use PVC to make the throttle act more like a collective.  The X-55 will run you about $200. Check out /r/hotas and /r/hoggit for more.  From what I hear, proper collective/cyclic hardware for simming starts at around $1500."

Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the United States Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61.  The UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed.

Helicopters,2fnrrv,Deltasteve,2,Sat Sep 6 20:06:42 2014 UTC,"Maybe if you circle what you are talking about in paint. I don't see it, to be completely honest.   The only thing I could think of is if they hooked up to the external ICS port, as that is on the left side. We are doing this a lot now with the wireless ICS mods that have been installed, and they make the left rear ICS very quiet when hooked up through the wire.   Where were these taken?"
Helicopters,2fnrrv,Deltasteve,0,Sat Sep 6 20:07:29 2014 UTC,took these today in DC. I circled what I'm talking about and cropped it a bit.

Helicopters,2fhn6m,darthchurro,13,Thu Sep 4 21:49:00 2014 UTC,"I'm going to second this. It looks impressive--lots of stuff taken from a F-117, it looks like--but it's unlikely when you get to the details.    The four tubes toward the front are unlikely to be weapons unless they've completely relocated the avionics compartment, and they're too big to be pitot tubes.  The normal pitot tubes are not present.  There does not appear to be any access to the pilot assist area / hydraulics deck. No wire strike protection system (though that may be plausible for a stealth aircraft) No chin window Seats are completely different from real Blackhawk seats, for no apparent reason No overhead circuit breaker panels No Power Control Levers visible    Source: active duty UH-60 pilot"

The setup here completely defeats the purpose, they just wanted to evoke the F-117.

That being said, the Comanche was a fantastic test bed and it spearheaded countless rotary wing technological breakthroughs, especially in the areas of Avionics and noise suppression. Its greatest contribution, however, was its cancelation. The funds that were saved by canceling the project were put to better use by developing and producing the modern avionics suites we have in the UH-60M and the CH-47F today."

Helicopters,2fkifp,achemze,2,Fri Sep 5 23:51:04 2014 UTC,"For the civilian career path you'll need to flight instruct for a couple years, probably until 1500 PIC. That's where the real uncertainty is because there needs to be enough students to get those hours before you're broke or burned out. I don't know what the projection is for helicopter flight training in the next 5 or so years but there are lots of different thoughts about what could happen. I think it would be accurate to say that without the GI Bill, helicopter flight schools would be in serious trouble."

Helicopters,2fkifp,TurdFlight85,2,Sat Sep 6 08:09:27 2014 UTC,"Well there are 2 ways it can be used: with a degree program or just through the flight school. With the degree program, it can fund 100% of the training but some schools decided to take advantage of this and convince GI Bill students to pay for extra training that they don't need. My understanding is that the VA caught on to this and will be changing things. This is hearsay and I don't know what will happen.  The other method of using the GI Bill will reimburse students 60% of training costs for ratings after their private rating. I don't think this is going away and is still quite a bit of help for veterans but requires them to save money or find funding somehow."

Helicopters,2ex69a,kevinjdolan,3,Fri Aug 29 14:35:25 2014 UTC,"My guess is that it's avoided because it would require an airspeed indicator be designed specifically for that aircraft.

Helicopters,2ex69a,R0T0R,1 point,Fri Aug 29 16:41:19 2014 UTC,"You have to do that anyhow, since all the other markings on the gauge like the red line and green arc and shit are aircraft specific. If they can print those lines on there specifically for the aircraft, it is a good question why they couldn't calibrate the numbers accordingly as well."
Helicopters,2ex69a,achwas,3,Fri Aug 29 16:53:34 2014 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I believe that limitations markings are not permanently applied in the same way that numbers are.  The arcs can be changed and customized.  IAS is really an arbitrary number.  It's just a way to convert a certain differential pressure (for example ""+5 PSI"") into something that pilots can understand.  If every ASI associated a given pressure differential with a different airspeed, it would probably get ugly when you wanted to swap ASI's between aircraft, or were in the business of calibrating instruments.  A separate CAS scale that could be applied to the instrument in a less permanent fashion would be really cool, though."
Helicopters,2ex69a,R0T0R,1 point,Fri Aug 29 17:20:07 2014 UTC,"I think this makes a lot of sense to me -- I had assumed the ASIs installed were already type-specific, but it makes sense to me that there would be standard ASIs, since manufacturing a great number of differently labelled ASIs would be costly. Though if I were a manufacturer, that sounds like a goldmine.  If you had a digital ASI, theoretically it could contain a database of all the CAS/IAS charts and calibrate itself automatically to the specific type you are flying without any hardware changes."

Helicopters,2ex69a,achemze,1 point,Sat Aug 30 03:00:54 2014 UTC,"Are you asking why doesn't the AS gauge work like a car speedo with MPH/KPH both being shown at once?   I imagine it's because most AS gauges are already small and having another set of numbers and presumably another shade of text that works both day and night ... isn't exactly easy or more importantly cheap.  However, the big commercial jetliners do have IAS/CAS mated on the PFD. Along with TAS and wind direction. I think some of the upper end helicopters do this but i don't have direct experience in that."
Helicopters,2ex69a,achwas,2,Fri Aug 29 16:11:25 2014 UTC,"I think he is asking why there is IAS on the gauge at all. Why don't they leave the IAS off completely, calibrate the numbers on the gauge to match the calibration graph in the flight manual (including Vne, Vy and whatnot) and done?"
Helicopters,2ex69a,achemze,1 point,Fri Aug 29 16:52:43 2014 UTC,"I believe this has to do with the fact that you're basically using the same AS gauge in multiple applications. I also don't believe you can ""calibrate"" an AS gauge, since its a static measurement based on diaphragm travel. The amount you would have to calibrate it depends on your actual aircraft and the pitot tube/static port routing. You'd end up having AS gauges per type, to satisfy this need, which is pricey (manufacture, shipping, sales, inventory and most importantly, FAA certification)."
Helicopters,2ex69a,mickycfly,1 point,Fri Aug 29 17:12:08 2014 UTC,Desperately trying to remember last time I used CAS
Helicopters,2ex69a,HeliBif,1 point,Sat Aug 30 07:28:37 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure it's because the relationship between them is not constant, but is dependent on various atmospheric conditions. So by making different lines, you just have another arbitrary AS gauge that is only true under 1 set of conditions.   EDIT: but it's been a while since flight school, and I'm just a lowly daytime VFR pilot, so I could be wrong."
Helicopters,2ex69a,achwas,2,Fri Aug 29 15:02:26 2014 UTC,"The IAS/CAS relationship should be a constant for any given machine. CAS is only a correction for instrument / installation error, caused mainly by the angle of the pitot tube to the relative wind at different airspeeds.  The graph or table in the flight manual that shows this calibration is valid for all atmospheric conditions, it's simply IAS vs. CAS.  I don't really know the answer to OPs question though. One clue MIGHT be that CAS can change a little depending on aircraft configuration (see image above) when you have a fixed wing with flaps or landing gear extended, which changes the fuselage angle. Still doesn't really explain it though, especially when talking about helicopters.  All the critical airspeeds like Vne and such are actually CAS, they just convert them to IAS and then print them in the manual."

There is absolutely a difference between serving your country and jumping to be deployed to a shitty third world country. It can certainly be argued that serving in a warzone is more valiant than not going but why should I be faulted for being hesitant about getting shot at? I have never been shot at before. Are you telling me I should be anxious to do so? Pardon me for still having a few marbles rattling around in my head. Perhaps you were/are military and are all gung-ho about jumping down range but not everyone in the military has to be that way. The chance at coming home in a body bag isn't a joke. The Army says they need me and I liked what they had to offer. A chance at adventure, a chance at financial security, and maybe one day a chance to make a difference in something important. My cousin came back from Iraq with shrapnel in his skull and a severe TBI, my grandmother lost a close friend in Vietnam, and my classmate's brother died in Afghanistan. I pay close attention to the realities of war, including the potential that I may one day be overseas doing my damn best to pick up my fellow Americans and hauling their asses to a safe location. I'm not afraid to go but I'm not stupid either. I was originally supposed to be a 64 pilot but due to circumstance I can't control, I'll be flying people and groceries instead of slinging lead. My blood boils just as hot as any when I see Americans getting their heads cut off. Clearly my voluntary oath to serve wasn't enough for you."

Helicopters,2esswx,Cropgun,2,Thu Aug 28 18:53:15 2014 UTC,"The way I see it, it's a lot harder to break through on the helicopter side ever since the Silver State Helicopters fiasco followed by the recession. On the other hand, you could just about get a fixed wing CFI job anywhere right now though.  If you're dead set on helicopters and can't swing the money for SFAR requirements, you could look for a school using S269's. It's really a risk though, they could lead you to believe that they'll hire you (as many schools will) and then leave you dead in the water, floating in the sea of over-saturated helicopter CFI's. That's a really bad place to be without the SFAR requirements.   One other thing to consider, and I don't mean anything bad by this, but your Army training may not have prepared you to easily transition into piston helicopters at the level of proficiency needed to be a safe and employable instructor. My point is that maybe you'll end up paying for 15-20 hours of dual anyway to get really comfortable with light pistons.   Not sure if that changes your thoughts on putting that money towards SFAR requirements."

Helicopters,2end5k,Innovationwarp,1 point,Tue Aug 26 23:35:00 2014 UTC,"Looks more like several feet up front.  Maybe the shadows make it look different.  I would definitely land 90* left or right after seeing that.  Picture slightly less awesome, safety of flight improved.  Don't have to ask passengers for landing advice.   My .02 :)"
Helicopters,2end5k,achemze,2,Wed Aug 27 00:37:04 2014 UTC,"Here, this shows how the ground sloped up in the front. Looks like there is 6"" more, and it would be real close to touching the underside of the nose of the belly.  I was wrong. I had more room behind my skid than the passenger side. The passenger bear paw looks floating, but there is a flat rock under the bear paw and was wedged in there. Machine couldn't flip over backwards. Was almost perfectly level nose to tail, and slightly sloped left to right. I think I'd land this way again? I might bring a tape measure to see what the actual best landing config is for my buddies who wanna go land on it."

Helicopters,2eip5q,sheeps_with_fish,4,Mon Aug 25 10:37:01 2014 UTC,"The article's title implies that there's a debate, which, as the article illustrates, there isn't.  I don't think the added complexity and cost of a tilt rotor is justified for all blackhawk applications.  Something more along the lines of the Sikorsky S97 (they pictured the similarly configured X2 demo) with a pusher prop and counter rotating blades seems like a better configuration."
Helicopters,2eip5q,brufleth,0,Mon Aug 25 11:01:40 2014 UTC,"I find it infinitely perplexing as to why they need to re-invent the wheel.  If they want an osprey style helicopter, just order ospreys."
Helicopters,2eip5q,Cropgun,0,Mon Aug 25 13:50:11 2014 UTC,Agreed. Seems like they just want to spend some money.
Helicopters,2eip5q,c5load,2,Mon Aug 25 14:04:30 2014 UTC,"The Osprey is too heavy for the FVL parameters, and also the Army is looking for side doors rather than the rear-door only Osprey."
Helicopters,2eip5q,Cerebro64,2,Mon Aug 25 16:22:30 2014 UTC,"The Osprey is also significantly larger in footprint than a blackhawk as well as significantly more complex in terms of operation and complexity.  In motor vehicle terms, the current generation of blackhawk is like your early 90's F150 or Chevy pickup. Just enough technology and big enough to cover all your general purpose utility needs. The chinook is like your quad cab super duty dually. Carries alot of people and things and does it really well, but upkeep is kind of expensive and you definitely don't want to be driving that thing around in the city.  The Osprey is like a competition baja truck. It's built to go fast and far. It can carry stuff, just not nearly as much as a Chinook. And it sacrifices some low speed maneuverability in the tilt rotor vs helicopter configuration. It also requires a great deal more care and maintenance.  So while you could replace the F150 with the Baja truck, what you're gaining may not be what you need."
Helicopters,2eiask,Great_Dane89,3,Mon Aug 25 05:59:03 2014 UTC,"I feel like there's a couple of different profile of people in this industry. Those who paid their own way (loans, working multiple jobs, investments, etc), those who had their way paid (family money, trust fund babies, etc) and those who made the ultimate sacrifice (military) to learn. Of the people I've met who paid their own way, it seems a roughly 50/50 split between those who acquired the money first vs acquiring a loan. My interpretation of the two mind-sets is, one knows the practically of not owing tomorrow for todays fun. The other camp believes they'll be making 80k in 5-10 years and it won't be a big deal.  As my instructor told me, ""at some point, you have to start believing in yourself and that you can actually do it"". Its entirely a faith-based system.  Also compare the cost of this career re-education vs going to college to be re-educated. You'd basically be committing a similar amount of money/debt in hopes of acquiring a job in said new industry.  As someone who's currently struggling to justify the cost of commercial without being an ideal work candidate (physique-wise), I feel your pain and agony revolving around such a large number. I'm opting to save the cash upfront, so i'm less inclined to regret the decision in the end. I also think back to a CFI I met early on, who was working double time at a local grocery market to cover his flights and after 5 years, eventually became a CFI with zero debt and is currently flying tours."
Helicopters,2eiask,achemze,3,Mon Aug 25 07:15:40 2014 UTC,"It is a very large amount of debt if you're financing it all. I put just about all the money I made as a CFI towards it, then chipped away at it with whatever I had left over for a few years, and now am in a position where it will be paid off in less than a year from now. Total time it'll take me is roughly 5.5 years after I started working as a CFI. It could have already been paid off by now, but I paid out of pocket for a masters degree a few years ago (For the wife) so that took a decent chunk out of the ""Pay off my school loans"" fund.  It never kept me up at night, although it does suck knowing it will be a few years before I can justify really saving money for others things (Down payment for a house, project car, European vacation) In the end though it's probably a good thing that I went into such debt because it taught me it's not a fun place to be and helped kick my ass into gear and get my financial priorities straight.   As far as is it worth it, my answer is I'm writing this from work. I got here 5 hours ago and in the last 5 hours I've watched a little TV, cooked dinner, watched a movie, played some Grand Theft Auto and now am about to do a little reading before I go to bed. I'm home every night, I work at a great base that affords a fantastic quality of life, and I'm about to get paid to sleep. (And surf reddit, as it turns out) Yes, I think it was worth it. I could have gotten a bachelors and masters degree for the money, but then I'd be competing with everyone else with those for an office job I would never really like. I can't see myself doing anything else."

(Maybe we know each other already?) I am currently getting my finances in place before I start so to those who have already commented, thanks for your stories! Helps me out too. Wish I could have some experience behind me to share, but all I've got is that I've been with them studying for the past four years prepping myself to fly. Unfortunately I just can't get a co-signer. But I've seen several pilots (all of them) graduate and move on with incredibly rewarding careers. I think it's a faith based system as well. Know that with the effort and hard work it'll pay off. Personal advice I've gotten from the staff there that I first ignored was this. Stay single. Having a gf/bf will burn the money in your wallet. It can be done with being married and having kids obviously, but it's easier from what I've heard to stay single."
Helicopters,2efmsz,Rhoads0382,2,Sun Aug 24 09:35:13 2014 UTC,"I have a couple SIFT study guides on their way, but nothing here as of now. I also have not taken any of the practice tests yet, mainly for that reason.   I knew it would be highly competitive, but I had no clue that the civilian side was completely separate as far as admissions compared to prior enlisted. Slightly disheartening I suppose, but just all the more reason to give it my all.  Degree wise, that is not too big of an issue. I have enough credits for my Bachelor's, I just need to knock out 4 or 5 courses which are all available online. Mainly English and Math type classes. The only issue here would be keeping up with my workload and school. Sometimes I will have a 7 hour work day, but it commonly gets extended to 18 hours, or more, with absolutely zero notice. We do an on-call type thing 3 or 4 days in a row, and depending on how stupid people decide to be we are sometimes going 60 hours+ straight, and just passing our for an hour or two at a time in the office/backseat.  As far as getting a pilots license on my own and then applying, that unfortunately is impossible at this stage, being in Korea and not speaking more than the bare minimum of the language. I highly doubt they would let someone who barely speaks Korean into the air with them.  I also have not even started working for my letters of recommendation yet. As far as I know we only have 3 or 4 pilots, if that, that are actually stationed here and not just coming through from another post. You only see MAYBE 7 or 8 in the air a month and that is normally when some VIP is coming, so running into one and getting to know them enough to get a good letter won't be too easy. That one is probably going to have to wait until I PCS in May, unfortunately."

Helicopters,2efmsz,dmoss84,2,Sun Aug 24 13:10:05 2014 UTC,"You have a strong packet thus far, especially if your SIFT test results are strong. There are commercially sold study guides, like on Amazon, and a lot of applicants said it helped a lot. Many installation libraries have the study guides, although with you being in Korea, and the SIFT being fairly new, they may not have caught up. The test obviously has a minimum required score, but the board does not have their own secret cut-off score. What's important is the overall strength of the applicant. Deficiencies in one category can be overcome by strengths in others.  As for the current competitiveness, AD applicants are around 45% selection.   Source: Sat on the selection board last year."
Helicopters,2efmsz,dmoss84,1 point,Sun Aug 24 13:24:16 2014 UTC,"Thats good to hear, both on how the board looks at the packet and how often AD applicants get picked up. Definitely great to have input from someone who sat on the selection board, as well. Was there any preferance to applicants with natural 20/20 vision verses applicants who had previously had corrective surgery?  One of the study guides I ordered should be here on the 2nd, until then I will just keep using the FAA manual. Are there any practice tests you would recommend above the rest?

Comparing you to the prior enlisted guys I'm in training with, I would say your packet would certainly be competitive so long as you scored well on the SIFT and finished school. I was selected in May last year, and unfortunately a lot of flight slots have gone away so it's a bit tougher these days. With that said, if you grab a 300, have a bachelor's with a decent gpa, study for the tests, and have no serious criminal charges my money would be on you getting picked up. Get to know some senior warrants, too. LORs are extremely important."

I'm in instruments now and it's a lot more relaxed but there's a lot you have to know... Hmm, have I felt unprepared? Nah. Pretty much everyone gets through, even those that struggle immensely with flying eventually get through (I can't speak about advanced wing training tho). The academics aren't bad so long as you do some studying. The biggest piece of advice I could give is take everything a week at a time, but for now focus on building that packet.

Helicopters,2ecwee,mast-bump,14,Sat Aug 23 11:03:38 2014 UTC,"I was evacuating people that were stuck on a flooded highway once. One of them was a helicopter pilot himself (knew the guy). As I was coming in to land on short final for the middle of the highway, he waved me over and directed me to land on this piece of grass next to the highway. Presumably because it was a bit dryer.   There were 6 strings of 66kV line between me and that piece of grass.   It was very late in the day, but I still can't believe how he didn't register them. They were very visible from the ground up against the sky. I shook my head in slight disbelief and landed on the road as planned. He was quite shocked when I pointed it out later.  Point is: Unless they are waving you OFF or trying to warn you about something, do not trust anyone who might be trying to marshall you.   Also, if you ever have to change your mind about your landing spot while you are already on short final, abort the landing and set up a new approach, don't make last minute turns and low level air taxi moves that you weren't planning on."
Helicopters,2ecwee,achwas,6,Sat Aug 23 17:10:59 2014 UTC,"High and low orbits arent shown in the vid, unknown if they were done.  Accepting marshalling advise from an unknown.  Looks as if he dumps the collective just before the actual strike.  Im not one to criticize this guy, I long ago was taught that the biggest killer of helicopter pilots was wires, and that most of the time the impact wire was one the pilot knew about.. During my teens I made darwin roll in his grave by flying a kite into an 11kV line... from a boat... in bare feet.. :/ .. I knew about the wire and earlier had been paying great attention to it.. but after i had taken my mind of it.. I also have a much higher respect for the r44 after seeing this video.. after watching the as350 xmas tree accident from a few years ago i honestly didnt think a light helicopter (especially a robinson) would fair as well with heavy duty wires like those. Im definately interested to hear the opinions of the ag-pilots on this sub."
Helicopters,2ecwee,Cropgun,4,Sat Aug 23 11:16:32 2014 UTC,That was not a heavy duty wire.   That was a distribution line.   Those are the ones you want to hit if you're going to hit a wire.   My old man had a blade to wire strike in a 47 soloy many years ago.  Fucking corner wires are what always gets you.   Impact with wires is more of a big deal if the wire hits the fuselage/skids or comes into the cockpit.   Especially when carrying speed.   What really fucked him was when he panicked and dumped the collective.   He was screwed at that point.   How the pilot didnt see that giant ass wire is beyond me. The wire environment is no joke folks.
Helicopters,2ecwee,achwas,2,Sat Aug 23 14:39:55 2014 UTC,"How the pilot didnt see that giant ass wire is beyond me.  But I eat/breathe/sleep/live low level   Then you know that the wire was probably not visible from his angle. Sure, the poles were, if you are used to looking for clues like that. Maybe he even saw the wire itself 30 seconds earlier from a different angle.   Chances are that either way, he was distracted and stopped looking for it. That describes about 90% of wire strikes during takeoff and landing right there."
Helicopters,2ecwee,Cropgun,2,Sat Aug 23 17:03:30 2014 UTC,"I can promise you the wire wasn't visible until he was right on top of it.    I agree.   Probably got distracted.   If you ever lose a wire,  stop what you are doing  and go around."

When I pulled into their barn lot to turn around they said go ahead and use the ends, no big deal. Then about an hour later they decided to start harvesting again, but I think they only took another combine load off before they decided it was still too wet. That's why we are in there at the same time as them.   Pilot wanted a break so we took 45 or so to grab a bite while his family was there. We weren't too pushed at the time I don't think."

I have to say that you're lucky that you learned to fly in an R44. I hate the R22, but it will help fine tune the way you fly, because the R22 flies like shit :)"
Helicopters,2e1khl,Cropgun,2,Sat Aug 23 03:36:40 2014 UTC,"lol @, ""r22 flies like shit."""
Helicopters,2e1khl,achwas,4,Sat Aug 23 15:08:54 2014 UTC,"TLDR: Do the training in all 3 if you can  A couple things come too mind.    Its easier to move up into larger helicopters then to move down.  IE  You can go from flying a R22 to a AW139 easier then the other way.   Smaller almost aways means less stable.   Larger mean's more complicated but companies will give you the system's training you need.  For example look at SFAR 73 PIC requirements -  They credit R22 PIC time towards R44 experience but not the other way around.      The more airframes you're checked out on the better.   Even if its only 10 hours if you have that endorsement in the log book it can help you land a job.  Because the less/money a company has to spend on training you the better.     I did most all my training in the R44 (was 250/hour back then)  I got my R22 pic endorsement but not the CFI.   I had to send a number of students to other instructors because they only could afford R22.  Those are hours I lost out on. But in the mean time I got allot of hours flying tours in the R44 and  My first turbine job was flying tours in the canyon.    Be scientific and track how many hours each type of aircraft the company flies per month.  I would bet the R22's fly pretty much non stop.  The R44 gets the heavy guys and IFR students. And the R66 only flies once in a while.  It would make sense to prepare your self to fly what you're going to be flying the most later on.   In other words if you do all your training in the R66 because cost isn't a factor; Then you start working and the R66 doesn't fly much,  you're not going to build time very fast. Meanwhile the R22 guys are getting to 1000 hours and getting picked up for those turbine job's you desperately want.   If it was me I would try to do 40-50 hours of training in each aircraft R22/R44/R66  and get the PIC/CFI sign offs for each.   At 50 hours in each and 200 total you should be employable.   I did all my training at a small part 91 school. Not sure if a 141 school will let you jump from airframe to airframe when you want during training.         Turbine time isn't necessary early in your career unless you can get allot. Once you start working try to get as much R66 time as you can. having several hundred hours in an R66 will probably help you get a turbine job. But don't pay for turbine time out of pocket.  There are a handful of companies that will take low time piston guys and put them in turbine ships.  They need pilots and will train you.  As a side note Pretty sure allot of old timers/ex-mil wouldn't even really count the R66 as a real turbine helicopter - its always just going to be a Robbie to them."
Helicopters,2e1khl,Cropgun,1 point,Wed Aug 20 05:00:46 2014 UTC,"69 hours isnt alot of turbine time, correct? right now we have 5 R44s and 2 R22s. the 44s fly nonstop(85% of the time) and the 22s are usually for the really small guys(15% ot the time). the majority of our fleet here and in AZ are 44s. I would really love to stay on the 44 for all of my CFI. I think i have a strong chance of landing a job here after training completes. This wash-out rate is real!  I wouldnt mind paying out of pocket for 10 hrs 22 just to get the pic endorsement.  Am i just as employable early on with 1000 flight hrs and no turbine or 1000 hrs 100-150 turbine?

Helicopters,2dytfm,CoveredInBees1,3,Tue Aug 19 23:24:35 2014 UTC,What would the cyclic and collectives be doing on each rotor for pitch/yaw/roll for a side-by-side tandem like the V-12? Assuming the left rotor is turning clockwise.   I would love to (one day) build an RC heli with that layout to fly FPV but the control scheme is beyond my ability to figure out in my head.
Helicopters,2dytfm,General-Thrust,5,Tue Aug 19 08:57:50 2014 UTC,"Collective = increase/decrease the pitch angle of both rotors equally, thus creating more/less force straight up/down.  Roll:  Cyclic left = Increase pitch collectively on the right rotor (maybe also lower it on left side?).  Cyclic right = Increase pitch collectively on the left rotor (lower on right?)  Pitch:  Cyclic forward = The same as a normal helicopter, only with a swash plate tilting forward on both rotors.  Cyclic back = Swash plate tilting backwards on both rotors.  Yaw: (when hovering)  Right pedal (rotating right) = Left rotor tilting forward and right rotor tilting backward.  Left pedal (rotating left) = Right rotor tilting forward and left rotor tilting backward.  Yaw in forward flight was mainly dealt with by the tail fin."
Helicopters,2dytfm,Karbus,3,Tue Aug 19 15:45:59 2014 UTC,"The engines are locked at 80% output IIRC and most functions are controlled with the collectives in helicopter mode. The pitch is controlled with swashplates as in a normal heli. The yaw is controlled by counter-rotating the engine nacelles away from vertical (if the left points 3 deg forward and the right 3 deg back it'll rotate to the right), and the collective thrust is automatically adjusted to compensate for slightly reduced upwards thrust. The roll is controlled by differential thrust (using the respective collectives). I had the very same question a few weeks back and had to spend a couple hours to find the info. Then, of course, in forward flight mode the swashplates are locked and it's controlled the same as a normal plane."

Helicopters,2ds25t,Geo87US,8,Sun Aug 17 07:04:29 2014 UTC,It's mostly for legacy purposes. The grapical representation closely resembles the A/L dashboard. It makes for easier pilot transition. The software and MFD were developed for the Army.

They dint want to add anything complex apparently the Mike model has a lot of improvements than just the glass panel (which i did not knew) and the army and navy wanted to reduce the time it took for this program to be completed from two years to 6 months. So I kinda would understand them not wanting to go all crazy with the upgrades.
Helicopters,2ds25t,brufleth,1 point,Sun Aug 17 11:50:48 2014 UTC,Will software changes for the digital displays still cost so much that they choose to change engine controls software and even run behavior instead of fixing the display software?
Helicopters,2ds25t,brufleth,1 point,Sun Aug 17 16:23:52 2014 UTC,I am not sure. Can you elaborate a bit more on this? So I assume on the M model they decide to update engine control software rather than update the display code because of cost?  That does not make a lot of sense. Since both I assume need to be validated and Engine Much more than display I think.
Helicopters,2ds25t,J_Tomonaga,1 point,Sun Aug 17 17:36:00 2014 UTC,"I work for an engine supplier.  We've done engine software turns instead of fixing aircraft display software multiple times.  We just aren't expensive enough.  RC or whoever makes the software for these MFDs charge ~1million for a software turn even to change something as simple as when the gauge goes from green to amber.  We'll do it for anywhere from a quarter of that to free.  Yeah, we have to certify to class A or equivalent (with whichever agency is appropriate)."

Helicopters,2dnwvv,highfrosty,3,Fri Aug 15 20:04:43 2014 UTC,"Army here so I can speak from that perspective. I wouldn't get too wrapped up about the physical and mental requirements, you will have medical screening before you are accepted and you will see a flight surgeon as part of your packet.  They won't give it the OK if you cannot pass the required physical.  As for the other branches I do not know but in the case of the Army if you do the Warrant Officer flight training program (WOFT) you are guaranteed a seat, what that means is you do not have to join first and then hope/compete for flight school.  This is only with the WOFT program.  If you go the ROTC route then you are competing for your seat in flight school.  Good and bad experiences are many, lot's of flight time, good pay, good benefits (for now), numerous opportunities to do fun and interesting things. It comes at a cost though,  multiple deployments both training and real world.  My last over seas tour had me gone from home for 18 months and prior to leaving I was TDY (temporary duty) for 6 months so I spent a full two years away from my home/family.  I did  have a few opportunities for leave, but it was only around 30 total days that I saw them during the two years. Currently in the U.S Army we are drawing down but we will always have to bring in new bodies.  Lastly if you do decide to join remember recruiters are sales men.  They are going to tell you that there is no such thing as the WOFT program, that you must enlist first then apply for flight school, that it's easier to get picked up if you enlist first blah blah blah...

And yeah, I heard from a lot of them the same thing you've said about the recruiter lies.  Unless you have an awesome recruiter (rare) you're going to be quarterbacking this the whole way."

Helicopters,2dnwvv,retreatingbladestall,1 point,Sun Aug 17 18:20:35 2014 UTC,"The WOFT program is all done prior to actually joining, if you do not get selected you simply walk away and have NO obligation to the US Army.  Once selected you will be given a date to go to basic then Warrant Officer candidate school.  Through basic you will wear enlisted rank, as soon as you graduate basic your pay is bumped up to that of E5 but you never wear that rank, you are a Warrant Officer candidate until graduation from WOCS at which time you are appointed WO1.  If you have already enlisted then you have to apply for Warrant Officer candidate school, the WOFT program is only for people coming directly into the Army and straight to flight school, commonly called High school to flight school or street to seat."

The last number I heard was 8 applicants for every school slot so it is a very competitive selection.  I spent 22 years as a helicopter mechanic/crewchief in the Army so I am quite biased...I loved it.  If you have questions about the process and have access to someone who is or was a pilot ask them, but you can also contact Brad or John listed on the page linked above. They are very busy, it is only 2 of them for thousands of applicants each year so don't expect them to spend a lot of time holding your hand walking you through the process.   Army Aviation has been making some cut backs at the senior level, but for the most part, pilots are always in demand.

As someone else mentioned already they like to do that because filling Enlisted quotas are much harder to do. I procrastinated too long and ended up getting injured before I ever submitted my application. By the time I got around to doing it, I needed 3 waivers for medical problems, age restriction and time in service.

The Coast Guard is great about getting flight time and is constantly doing the mission as opposed to only training. We fly the HH-65 dolphin (dauphin) from eurocopter and the HH-60 Jayhawk. I cannot stress what a great opportunity the Coast Guard had to offer. I could go on and on but if you have questions feel free to shoot me a PM

Helicopters,2ddbap,Torkin,3,Tue Aug 12 21:35:05 2014 UTC,"I think getting a bachelors degree is worth it in the end. Yes it is true that a lot of flying jobs are all based on experience and hours, but having the bachelors degree will just put you on top with the experience. I just graduated Utah Valley University with a degree in aviation science. I learned a lot from the classes that I would of never learned in flight school, so that's experience for me in it self because not many pilots will learn those things with out getting their bachelors.  For me the bachelors degree was a 100% worth it because now I am going direct commission with the Navy for a pilot seat and I couldn't do that other wise without a degree. Having a bachelors degree also provides you with a back up plan just in case flying doesn't work out. Also I've seen a lot of flying jobs out there that prefer a bachelors degree."

This one maybe a little hot, but it wasn't that hot. In the XCAR configuration without a load, you're relatively light and should have a pretty decent chunk of power available. Aircrewman has his gunner's belt too long and leaned out a little too far.  Fortunately, it's nothing more than a bruised ego instead of a pretty nasty fall."

We Army guys had several discussions with them about their practices around our acft. Completely unnecessary and unsafe next to other acft, especially when they belong to another service. His speed wasn't too fast, the stab was already programmed down quite a bit. As soon as he was sliding in out of trim, and the airspeed wasn't coming directly into the pitot tubes, the stab was already programming down. He was too fast and poorly aligned, and the trunk monkey harness is to keep you in the acft, not arrest your fall. I'll never ride in a Navy bird, those guys are hotshots who are poor pilots. IMO... I'll be waiting for the bashings."
Helicopters,2da6ix,yayhelicopters,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:05:23 2014 UTC,you also get the stab to program down by slipping left. Slipping left reduces the flow through the tail rotor (T/R provides 2.5% of total lift). this causes the tail to fall a little. Stabilator  programs down to help compensate.  Doesn't help much at a hover.

They take beat cops out of patrol cars that are interested in flying,  and put them through flight school free of charge to the officer.  Your college degree wont matter much,  if at all to a civilian operator.  They don't give a shit how much useless knowledge you can memorize.   They care about you having enough time to be cheaply insured and that you can fly the mission they carry out."
Helicopters,2dadn4,Cropgun,-5,Tue Aug 12 02:09:08 2014 UTC,"They take beat cops out of patrol cars that are interested in flying, and put them through flight school free of charge to the officer.   Well my understanding is that they used to do that 15 or 20 years ago, but nowadays it is mostly ""Take cops that are ex military and already have rotor wing time, and put them through training to fly the helicopter.   Reason being mainly that most police departments are going away from small single engine ships, and fly Twin Stars and up with multi role capability, winches and NVGs and shit. The insurance for someone fresh out of flight school to fly one of those wouldn't just be ridiculous, it would simply be not available at all.  There are probably still some smaller cities around that have Jet Rangers or even R44s or whatever, but as far as I know all the bigger cities have gone away from that."

Helicopters,2cx9p1,snakpak13,3,Thu Aug 7 21:59:50 2014 UTC,Do you know why the military has such a hard-on for short lines? Nobody does this in the civilian world
Helicopters,2cx9p1,O00O00O00O,6,Thu Aug 7 22:50:04 2014 UTC,"Pure speculation, but I'd bet its because we're typically not as concerned about precision placement as commercial customers are.  The shorter the line, the lower we can be above obstacles going into an LZ for a quick dropoff.  I'll see if i can find anything about it in the 48.09  Edit 1: I'm just going to post as I find things.  Short Line: 100m diameter minimum landing area. Long Line: 125m diameter.  So we are required to use a short line for smaller LZs"
Helicopters,2cx9p1,snakpak13,3,Thu Aug 7 23:42:54 2014 UTC,"interesting - we use long lines (amongst other reasons) so we can put loads into holes that are too small to fit the rest of the machine. Then again we typically don't get shot at.  When using long lines, do you fly vertical reference? Or is it still done with a spotter looking at the load while the pilots look straight ahead? Because that would explain why they want a bigger LZ for longer lines..."
Helicopters,2cx9p1,O00O00O00O,2,Fri Aug 8 00:09:02 2014 UTC,"Never flown long lines, but thats a correct assumption. For sling load ops the Crew Chief is the one that is focused on the load.  The way our training manual lays out duties is P* focused outside to monitor altitude and avoid obstacles, P monitors instruments and helps with A/C clearance and operates cargo hook switches and radio calls, and Crew Chief focuses on the load, guides the P* during load pickup and directs the P* when setting down the load.  This is doctrinally speaking, I'll bet that there are units out there that operate differently based on their mission."
Helicopters,2cx9p1,snakpak13,2,Fri Aug 8 00:54:00 2014 UTC,That makes sense then and also explains why shorter lines are preferred. I guess it would be pretty hard to lean far enough out of a UH60 for vertical reference anyways.

Helicopters,2ck5re,06286208998628034825,11,Mon Aug 4 04:15:09 2014 UTC,"The blades aren't flat. They have what we call ""washout"", meaning the blade is twisted. The pitch angle isn't the same at the tip than it is at the blade root. This is necessary because the blade would otherwise produce way more lift at the tips than at the root (due to the higher speed of the tip).  Here is a picture that shows this on an airplane propeller: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Prop_feather.jpg - rotor blades are the same, just with smaller angles (and obviously the axis of rotation is different than in this picture, which also shows a feathered propeller, which is the opposite of a rotor at ""flat"" pitch... anyhow, just ignore the background, the shape of the propeller blade itself is what I am getting at)  As a result of this, when the collective pitch is set to zero, the blade tips are actually at a slightly negative pitch, and the blade roots are still a few degrees positive. So the rotor will always move a little bit of air, no matter what you do with the collective. A lot of very complex factors have to be considered when designing a rotor system, a little bit of residual air movement when the machine is on the ground is only a minor compromise."
Helicopters,2ck5re,O00O00O00O,3,Mon Aug 4 04:43:07 2014 UTC,"Also we can throttle down to idle for patient/passenger loading. Depending on the helicopter the rotor wash is minimal at idle, and barely noticeable if you're used to working around it all the time."

You will see that when there is no pitch pulled it is really sedate.   Typically you will only get a strong breeze is when the pilot is pulling a little bit of pitch to see if they can lift the skirt of the girl getting on/off the flight."

There's Maritime, Tailhook, and Rotary.  Maritime will send you to multi-engine training in the T-44 or T-12.  Then on to the P-3 or P-8 for your actual fleet platform.  Tailhook you go fly the T-45.  Then you choose either jets or E2/C2.  E2/C2 go to multi-engine training before their wings, Jets fly more in the T-45 and then go to fly the F/A-18 (various models to select).  If you select Rotary you go fly the TH-57 (Bell 206).

After sending out a few hundred resumes in my country, and worldwide, and getting no response except the two I've just mentioned, decided the appropriate decision is to head back to school if at all possible. I know being a mechanic will most likely pigeonhole me into that job for years to come, but I love turning wrench on things, there are plenty of jobs for apprentices, and I figure I might luck out and get to ferry the replacement machines into the bush / do my own power checks / etc, and get the odd hour here and there.

It is a whole different beast compared to sea level autos.   Everything happens faster, the RPMs will decrease quicker, and increase quicker so you will need to adjust the collective faster to maintain the RPMs in the green.   The glide will also be shorter, with a rate of decent that can be close to 2000 at times.   The flare will also have a quicker RPM build and RPM decay so lowering the collective to the stop is important in the flare to maximize the amount of pull you have to cushion (in full downs)  And yes this is because the air is less dense than sea level. High altitude autos are a lot more unforgiving."

Helicopters,2c3663,torchbearer101,1 point,Wed Jul 30 18:26:12 2014 UTC,"Longer glide, so you should take a few flights getting familiar with the airport etc, RPM changes are slower so you wont have to be so quick on the entry.   Also, don't be afraid to use the max glide configuration if you feel you're short. Blade stall will happen much later at sea level (~80% instead of ~85-88% RPM)  edit - Where are you training?"
Helicopters,2c3663,Seth0351,3,Wed Jul 30 18:47:35 2014 UTC,I feel like if you actually have an CFII in a freaking S61 you should know the answer to this..
Helicopters,2c3663,zippyajohn,4,Wed Jul 30 00:29:50 2014 UTC,"Do you think you auto rotate a 2 engine aircraft to the ground?  But I guess you wouldn't know the answer to that.  ;)  A double engine failure is considered so rare that autorotations are generally only done at altitude to check the auto rotation revs (pitch link adjustments).  I was the SIC.  The command pilot might in his annual training, but I never heard of it.  I'm not even sure if its required on the PIC type check ride.  Not to mention, I think the check on the collective is unique to R22's, but I could be wrong.    In the 61, the collective goes all the way down.  There is a reference sheet that you look at that factors in the weight of the aircraft, temp and altitude that says what the rotor RPM should be.  The pitch links are adjusted accordingly.  But the collective stays all the way down.  And all my jobs/flight experience have been at sea level, until my current one as a pilot/operator in an R22.  And you'll notice, my question is referring specifically to the R22 at altitude.  This is a helicopter I haven't flown for years, and never with ground level at this altitude, hence the question.    I hope you are OK with me asking people who may be more experienced than me with an R22 and that altitude what they think."

Helicopters,2bzn83,Rollondger,9,Tue Jul 29 02:05:34 2014 UTC,"Showing off is stupid, showing off while being filmed is very stupid. Showing off while being filmed by a famous actor in Australia is extremely stupid, given the very recent history of CASA actively going after R44 pilots that where filmed showing off on video. This has happened several times in the past few years, resulting in a few license suspensions and (ridiculous) court battles between pilots and CASA. And everybody in the NT must remember the shit show that ensued after ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" aired. Really, you'd have to be industrial strength retarded to let yourself be filmed while doing anything even remotely sketchy with a helicopter in that country.  So to nobodies surprise, this video is now also under investigation.  From the article I gather that this move was done by some random pilot that didn't even have anything to do with the people on the ground. If that is true (if), then the guy is beyond all description.  ....  All that being said, the move itself -unnecessary as it was- wasn't especially spectacular or dangerous, he didn't overfly anyone, there are no obstacles he could have hit, and there were no passengers on board. This sort of maneuver is done half a dozen times daily by any mustering pilot, except not for show-off purposes. It places a fair bit of stress on the tail boom which is why it's probably not the smartest thing to do in an R44 - then again so does hovering in a crosswind. No operating limitations should have been exceeded."

Helicopters,2bpxxb,c5load,3,Fri Jul 25 20:18:01 2014 UTC,"the -60 has specific tie down spots for the rotors.    For the Navy H-60s, the rotor system has a built in automatic blade fold setup.

Helicopters,2bpxxb,lowflier,5,Fri Jul 25 23:38:51 2014 UTC,"Alternate reason: I know for the 60s at least, our droop stops, which limit the blades from falling to ~4' from the deck when they're below a certain rpm, can sometimes pop out (I would know, one popped out on my very first preflight). With that in mind, with the blades at the 45, 135, 225, and 315, if they pop out they won't strike the aircraft and damage it."

Only thing I normally am checking for during the flight controls check is good movement in the main and tail, with no binding. I guess I'm sposta look for droops popping out too, but I've never heard of it happening. Worst I've ever heard is of the droops sometimes not going back in, maybe somehow both springs were lost or something, and they had a firehose spray them back in. Never seen it myself."

Helicopters,2bpxxb,BobReno,1 point,Sat Jul 26 02:44:12 2014 UTC,Yeah I was under the impression it's just a Blackhawks frame but the Seahawks rotor/head to accommodate blade fold on ships so very likely the droop stops somehow got manipulated along the way
Helicopters,2bpxxb,carryonaye,2,Sat Jul 26 14:59:22 2014 UTC,"For an H-53E there are two positions for the blades prior to start-up or post  shut down.    In the first case, the rotor is positioned so that a blade is not directly over the Auxiliary Power Plant (APP) which is located in front of the main gear box and rotor system.  The rotor is mechanically rotated in the direction of rotation until a blade is approximately over the left seat pilot and is electronically detected and controlled.  The the second case, for blade folding, the main rotor is rotated in the shortest direction until the number 1 blade is over the tail.  This blade is mechanically fixed and all the other blades are then in position to fold back correctly.  Again the proper position is electronically detected and controlled."

Helicopters,2bq5xd,c5load,2,Mon Jul 28 03:03:27 2014 UTC,"My recommendation: Figure out what you want to do flying and then figure out how to get yourself from here to there.  If you want to do military flying, then go into the military. If you're looking to end up in a traditional civilian job you can go civilian or military, although the timelines and money spent will be a bit different. Trouble is making long term life plans fresh out of high school will probably be a stretch, especially since it sounds like the idea of military aviation seems to be new for you.  First, I can't say too much about military aviation as I only know what I've heard and read from others. I know the application process for the WOFT program is very competitive and seems to be a whole ordeal in itself. There's plenty of reading you can do on the process to give you a better idea of what to expect. Verticalreference.com has lots of info and discussion on just that. I will also say I've heard time and time again if you go into the military just to get your flight training you're doing it for all the wrong reasons and you won't last, but as I said before thats really outside the scope of my own experience.  Civilian wise if you're dead set on going into the military regardless then you'll have some options on what to do when you get out. You can use the post 9/11 GI bill to fund your flight training although you'll also be going to a college for a degree at the same time. Great if you're looking for both off those, a bit of a hassle if you just want to fly. Get through school, get a job as a flight instructor, get hired by an entry level turbine operator, build your hours and work your way into whatever field you want.  As far as which flight training program looks better to prospective employers: Mostly irrelevant. Employers for the most part want the person who is most qualified i.e. hours in type, similar mission profiles, similar climates etc...  Perks of civilian training: Home every night, choice of where to live, not going to be deployed, more flight hours in a shorter span of time.   There are pros and cons to each path. You can get stuck in both routes and neither one guarantees you'll be able to make a career out of it.   Personally, I wanted to end up flying EMS in my hometown. I figured out what they flew, took jobs to get me experience in that airframe and climate and ended up where I wanted to be. (Civilian trained)"
Helicopters,2bq5xd,c5load,1 point,Sat Jul 26 22:29:18 2014 UTC,Thank you for taking the time to reply. Wow that was a lot of information. Is it as competitive in the commercial world? If I did go with commercial school it sounds like it would be a long road before getting an entry level job. Obviously not as long as a r year contract with the military. But I guess my question for you is how long did it take you to get to a job where you were actually happy? Doesn't necessarily have to be the job you are currently working at but just a job where you were getting decent pay and actually flying.
Helicopters,2bq5xd,c5load,1 point,Sat Jul 26 23:50:22 2014 UTC,"I was happy working as a flight instructor. I made around 30k which isn't great money in the grand scheme of things, but I was 21 and lived cheap so it was more than enough. Started instructing about a year after I started flight school and then flew tours making about 55-60k after instructing for 16 months. So less than 2.5 years after starting to fly I was in a job I liked and making enough money to live comfortably. A year after starting tours I moved to a different tour company and made 95k."
Helicopters,2bq5xd,c5load,1 point,Sun Jul 27 00:38:23 2014 UTC,That's not bad at all! In the flying community do companies just look at your hours? Do you apply to places or is it more of like a reference type deal? Also if you don't me asking what school did you go to?

Helicopters,2bq5xd,R0T0R,3,Sun Jul 27 15:04:22 2014 UTC,"So let me get this straight... you're asking whether you should join the military, get out, and pay the ~$200k for your commercial w/instrument rotary wing from a civilian instructor...  or go into WOFT, pay nothing, and get the training for free, along with the commercial license that comes with it?  And with few exceptions, your training from the military will be better.

The Dodosim 206 models systems better than the Dreamfoil 206, but the aerodynamics and control feel are far more realistic on the Dreamfoil.  I suspect that the Dreamfoil 206 is due for an overhaul, when compared to the 407 in terms of polish.  I'd like to see larger 206 series like a Longranger IV modelled as well, with the modulated C30P start.  I don't like how X-Plane has incipient Vortex Ring State as if your blades suddenly vanish, instead of control mushiness or increased vibration at onset of VRS.  The parameters are there, just not the feedback.  None of them really offer the best demonstration of LTE either.    The DCS UH-1 is pretty damn close to the real thing, I just find it a bit too unstable in the hover even trimmed out, and for some reason I get porpoising in forward flight.  I use Saitek X-55 controls with the springs remove, and it feels about as precise as a jetranger with the frictions completely off."

Helicopters,2bksd1,KTBFFHCFC,2,Thu Jul 24 15:33:07 2014 UTC,"First, street to seat or enlisted? This is unrelated to your question.  Your flight time will depend on a lot of things. What airframe you fly, where you are stationed, whether you get to deploy or not, etc. For the UH-60, our flight minimums are 48 hours semianually (96 annually) and 18 hours simulator time annually. Those are minimums and unless you are pissing off the platoon leaders (who make the flight schedule) or fail to progress through the readiness levels, you will get more than that. People stationed in Korea, for example, tend to get significantly more hours than those stationed stateside. You can expect 500-1000+ on a 12 month deployment to a combat zone, but by the time you get through the program, I wouldn't count on that."

Helicopters,2bksd1,KTBFFHCFC,3,Thu Jul 24 17:24:52 2014 UTC,"Usually it goes the other way TBH. I know plenty of guys who dropped their commissions to be a warrant. Not many go the other way.

(2) Do you enjoy powerpoint and excel, getting your ass chewed because someone in your platoon/company/battalion etc. screwed up, going to briefings, and flying only your FAC 2 minimums every year?  If you answered yes to to question 1 stay warrant. If you answered yes to question 2 go commissioned."

Helicopters,2bg9nl,Ratdog445,1 point,Wed Jul 23 05:24:40 2014 UTC,"Be aware that vision corrective surgery is not 100% guaranteed to give you 20/20. Worse your starting Rx, worse your odds. For perspective, I had an OU -7.00 sph prescription before my PRK, and the percentage of patients who end up with 20/20 with that RX was something like 75%.   Side effects of the procedure can also be problematic. Glare from either a steep change in corneal shape or due to fibrous tissue in the cornea post procedure can impact your visual clarity. In addition, corneal nerve endings, by necessity, get severed so if you do not have dry eye before the op, you probably will after, and if you had it before expect it to get worse. Dry eye alone can cause a huge hit to visual clarity, as well - something patients at the optometrist office I work out of consistently under estimate.  Further, dry enough eyes and contacts are not a smart choice should the PRK not give you clear enough vision.  Where I am at now, for example, is with a minor residual Rx even after the touch up procedure, with eyes dry enough that I occasionally wake up in the morning to the glorious sensation of my corneal epithelium getting torn off by my eye lids."

I never have had to put in drops to moisten my eyes, albeit once a month sometimes. I live in CO, which tends to have 20% humidity unless there's a thunderstorm around."
Helicopters,2bg9nl,Ratdog445,1 point,Wed Jul 23 22:35:06 2014 UTC,"It really varries. Actually two types of dry eye, but what happens due to surgery is generally your body does not create enough tears because it can no longer easily detect how dry you are. Symptoms you might notice are itchiness, redness, fatigue of your eyes, blurriness, or headaches.  Ironically, excessive tearing is also a possible sign of it.  Gets bad enough and you can get completely bloodshot and inflammation of the iris which, by the way, is horrible feeling and often considered more painful than childbirth.  Some artificial tears, preferably without preservatives, and nothing that claims to get the red out, is basically all you need to treat it, though. Visine is the devil. Redness is the body trying to fix the issue."

Helicopters,2bf9qz,MindCorrupt,2,Tue Jul 22 19:38:28 2014 UTC,"I've never heard of a Heli with a right hand setup. But personally, if I had to pick an arm to have reduced function for flying a heli, I'd pick my left. Provided you're flying a machine with hydraulics and the frictions off, there is very little push/pull force required to operate the collective.  But, she might not pass a physical to even get her medical license. Worth looking into that. But also, an arm injury would limit a great number of potential jobs and really limit her options. Any off field job would require someone to be able to standup a barrel of fuel. A girl with one arm is going to struggle, so she would really be limited to airport jobs like scheduled service carriers   http://www.helijet.com/scheduled-services"
Helicopters,2bf9qz,iamkokonutz,2,Tue Jul 22 19:53:47 2014 UTC,"Depending on the helicopter, the amount of force needed to push/pull the collective can be adjusted by a friction knob.

Helicopters,2bf9qz,c5load,2,Tue Jul 22 19:54:24 2014 UTC,"I would think it is mostly an issue of getting a Medical certificate.  The only way is to talk to an FAA Doc about it.    I would agree with the other posts here - not a lot of force is needed - but when it is needed, you have to act fast.  If I were to suggest a simulation - have her sit in a standard dinner chair.  Put a 2 liter bottle on the floor.  Have her pick it up by the cap/neck with the left hand, and put it back down.  I say that would be about right to the most amount of force you'd need."
Helicopters,2bf9qz,caross,3,Tue Jul 22 20:08:10 2014 UTC,"I agree with everything but, have something to add regarding the 2 liter bottle test. Yes, that's about the most pressure you'd ever put into the collective (in extreme circumstances) but a more accurate test would be in the same chair, holding your left hand about 1"" above your left leg for an hour (perhaps watch some T.V. while doing so) and just be holding an empty tissue roll. Once the collective is lifted to a cruising speed, you hardly have to put any pressure on it, just keep it in place. If her injury causes her to fatigue over time, that would be the greater issue."

More networking, more airspace experience, more students, more flight schools, first to recover from recessions, more likely to have wealthy students, easier to find secondary work, more CFI positions and turnover, less likely to require relocation.  5) Train to the PTS, you're wasting your money trying to do a bunch of ""advanced"" training that real world operators don't respect anyway. They'll teach you that stuff when the PTS is behind you and when you're on their payroll.  6) Pick a school where you have a decent chance at getting hired.

I'm a 60 driver part time in the National Guard and full time I work for one of the biggest HEMES companies in the US (for privacy I'll withhold who, but if you want to get with me offline, it's a company with a great safety record who I highly recommend).  First of all, as far as the bad rep for EMS, I haven't heard much talk in the industry of that. Like u/caross said, it may be due to the hazards, I think I read a stat recently that HEMES was the 2nd most dangerous job out there, right behind Alaskan crab fisherman. So that may be where some of the stigma comes from. Yes, I won't lie, it's probably just as dangerous as anything you've done in Iraq or Afghanistan, because even though there was an enemy threat there, that still wasn't the leading cause of downed acft. Now you're doing everything single pilot, NVG, in a VFR only acft (for the most part). I will say that the industry and FAA are both working hard to improve our safety record, first with NVG implementation over that past few years and my company is starting to phase in auto pilots fleet wide. The FAA will most likely make HTAWS and few more things mandatory over the next few years. Additionally our opspecs from the FAA have pretty high wx minimums (comparatively) and our company minimums are even higher. Additionally, there's no company pressure to ever take a flight, from the management or the medical crew, and it's looked upon much more favorably to turn down a flight for scosh wx than to get caught up in it.  As far as the job itself, let me just start by saying that it is one of the most fun and rewarding jobs I've ever had the privilege of doing. About the only thing more exciting was flying MEDEVAC in Afghanistan, but this has much greater job satisfaction than doing any sort of Army training flights between deployments back in the rear. But it's also not for everyone, I love the go-go aspect and the inflight planning and higher workload that comes with it. Not to say we do anything in a rushed manner but you really have to manage and prioritize your workload, if that sounds like fun to you then you'll definitely enjoy this. The work schedule pretty much anywhere will be a 7/7 and that's due to accreditation requirements. The pay will be anywhere from 55-65k to start and that depends on your rating level (CP, CFI, ATP) and your hours. It's not what I would consider great but it's what they can get away with paying because it's a retirement job for mostly Army guys. Average flight hours will be anywhere from 150 to 300 but I think the 300 is pretty rare probably closer to 150/200 in my experience. But for one flight hour you may be gone from the base 2 or 3 hours. When you're not flying it's a very easy and relaxing job, unlike the Army with all your additional duties, here you are just a pilot for the most part.  Probably one of the biggest things which I haven't seen mentioned is the ability to work well with others. There tends to be a lot of conflicting personalities between pilots, nurses and medics and without any real rank structure you don't have authority over anyone unless you're in the acft. If you're an ass to them they can make your job real difficult. If you can come in, do your job safely and avoid whatever med crew drama that's going on for the day, you'll do fine. Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to give you a good perspective. If you've got any questions or want to get into more detail about anything just PM me."
Helicopters,2azd8x,meddriver,7,Fri Jul 18 07:25:13 2014 UTC,My dad flies for AirMethods. He did 20 in the Marines flying 53's. He freakin' loves his job and will only retire when they force him to.

Helicopters,2azd8x,Itsafootlong,2,Wed Jul 23 09:47:19 2014 UTC,"Nope, he's in Ohio. But he used to fly out of Tustin back before they closed it. He's a plank owner of HMH-466 Wolfpack."
Helicopters,2azd8x,yakimushi,5,Wed Jul 23 11:39:35 2014 UTC,"I had an interesting encounter with EMS today as they called my company directly to let us know we almost hit one of their ships with an R22. This was not the case. They use only hospital frequency when flying in the area and refuse to monitor or talk on tower or the other local airport freq (10mi away). I was told by their director that when flying in ""hospital airspace"" or to him, all the surrounding area of the 3-4 hospitals in the area. They (hospitals) are in the outer shelf of C airspace and have a freq of their own, yes, but they don't seem to understand when you're on tower and are issued a squawk code, you shouldn't have to monitor their frequency. Also, explain to me in their multimillion dollar helicopter equipped with TCAS and a flight crew (or at least a nurse looking out the window) how they don't see other ships in the area? They (some) have a cowboy asshole attitude and think that because they are HEMS they are above the rest. That's just my $0.02. I don't have a problem with medevac, I just have a problem with people who think they are entitled because of their position. Whether you are in a blackhawk, a Robinson, or a freaking glider.... Look out the motherfucking window and use your radio."
Helicopters,2azd8x,cowboy615,3,Fri Jul 18 03:37:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah but, they're saving lives, man. And my TCAS system doesn't work that well to be entirely honest. Make an air to air call and that's that, let the chips fall where they may."
Helicopters,2azd8x,Azhigher,2,Mon Jul 21 06:20:22 2014 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. They should monitor more than just hospital freq. The 22s at our flight school have one radio, the Eurocopters they're flying have up to 3 radios... They can monitor more than one and, with a click of a button, talk on more than one. But they are accusing us of being irresponsible because it's not comfortable for them to have to use the multiple functions on their radio."
Helicopters,2azd8x,cowboy615,2,Tue Jul 22 03:06:19 2014 UTC,"Not that it really matters, but help me understand the situation here. So you're flying under the outer shelf of C airspace, have a squawk code, and monitoring the tower freq outside outside of the C airspace?  If that is the case it reminds me of an instrument approach we used to shoot in flight school. The holding pattern was in what the local fixed wing school considered to be a practice area. The approach said to be on the airports CTAF but all the planes in the area were only monitoring the unofficial practice area frequency. Same problem you might be having, we only had 1 radio in the 22 and a big choice to make: Do we use the CTAF or do we make position calls on the practice area frequency?  Well, we did both. We monitored the CTAF and swapped over and made brief position reports so all the planes knew to at least look out for our little 22 up at altitudes they were rarely at if we weren't shooting approaches.  You can monitor tower and swap over for a couple seconds to let the hospital traffic know there's a 22 buzzing about. I can tell you from experience it's a lot easier to spot an Astar in a 22 with no modern avionics than it is to spot a 22 in an Astar."
Helicopters,2azd8x,Azhigher,2,Tue Jul 22 06:23:26 2014 UTC,"I fly EMS, I like it. In flight school I didn't think I'd ever want to, but after flying 600-800 hour a year for a while I was ready to slow down and get back home.  I think EMS gets a bad rap from some other pilots because it's easy. Seriously, it's not a lot of flying, a lot of free time to do whatever you want. It's a transition for some who aren't used to having crewmembers, some of whom can be very opinionated and want to give their input on the flight. You have to have the right kind of personality to get along.  Thoughts:  - I wouldn't count on 250-300 hour a year. 100-200 would be more in line with the averages I've seen.  - Your EMS experience will depend largely on what base you end up at. Some are very good and welcoming, some are black holes of despair. Find a good base and stick with it!  In the end, who cares what other people think about your field. I did tours for a while and everyone generally talks down to tour pilots. BUT, it was paying me 95k a year and getting me a boatload of hours so I could go do what I wanted when I was done. If a job seems like it will work out for you, pursue it."
Helicopters,2azd8x,Azhigher,2,Fri Jul 18 05:54:20 2014 UTC,"Lot of great information and discussion in here.  Posts that I saw may just have been from a safety standpoint that posters in other threads were speaking to.  Now that I look back though, it does look like its more likely a couple posters with strong opinions speaking down about the industry (which is noticeable in this thread too).  More often than not, the negatives I've heard about the EMS industry are from people's secondhand conversations with EMS pilots.  Seems like when you hear it straight from an EMS pilot, those individuals are actually pretty happy with their job.  I might need to accrue some more hours before sticking my nose in this field, but I think it will definitely be something I pursue!"
Helicopters,2azd8x,jcozine,1 point,Tue Jul 22 16:14:59 2014 UTC,"I've heard from our pilots that there are a lot of companies on the struggling end of the market, at least in bigger markets where multiple ems companies are competing, that will take the jobs other companies have refused due to wx and so on. So, there is a lot of economic pressure to take big risks, with no real concern for crew safety beyond how an accident would affect the bottom line. And if a particular pilot shows an unwillingness to take on risky jobs compared to his peers, guess how long he will last at a company of ill repute. I don't think this free market effect on safety occurs in the military as it does in the commercial world."
Helicopters,2azd8x,memostothefuture,1 point,Fri Jul 18 08:33:57 2014 UTC,"you should really ask this question on pprune.   that said, I'm consistently shocked at the state of EMS flying in the US. terrible weather, night, single engine? oh yeah, no problem. I think the EC135 and BK117 are what EMS should use, not AS350."
Helicopters,2azd8x,Azhigher,2,Fri Jul 18 08:45:14 2014 UTC,I like my Astar. 135 struggled with it's performance in the high temps out here in AZ. I'd rather just be conservative with weather and flying something that can lift. Give me an E-model astar any day of the week.
Helicopters,2azd8x,memostothefuture,2,Mon Jul 21 06:14:11 2014 UTC,"oh, I agree that they are nice nice machines but in an EMS role? AS355 I can see. how is the cabin working out with stretchers and crew for you? can they intubate, etc back there?   I was always impressed by the massive rear cabin the EC135 has and what organizations like the ADAC or BGS in germany (only place I know them in EMS role from) can do back there in flight. didn't know they were underpowered."
Helicopters,2azd8x,Azhigher,1 point,Mon Jul 21 06:35:15 2014 UTC,"Valid point! I like the Astar from a pilot's perspective. I don't concern myself with anything that happens in the back. Yes, it's tight for the crew and they do complain about lack of accessibility.   And I don't know if I'd say they were underpowered, maybe just not the best choice for hot and high conditions. They seem to do ok most places, just not my neck of the woods I guess."

From what I can gather in listening to EMS pilots   The pay is low for the experience level that most EMS pilots have. It can be pretty dangerous.  Even though they try to eliminate this, external pressures do have an effect. There can be politics within the companies they work for, and in the medical field. You don't fly many hours compared to other flying gigs, which can slow career progression."

Helicopters,2agiul,putittogetherNOW,3,Sat Jul 12 00:57:14 2014 UTC,When I see it folded I think of a tribal feather hat or a pile of butter knives.
Helicopters,2ahsud,Phaedrae,2,Sat Jul 12 06:35:18 2014 UTC,"Apart from many more qualified applicants in the pool, weekend helicopter pilots are a dangerous thing. The US army requires a minimum of 200 flight hours a year to maintain proficiency. 20-50 flight hours a year for a helicopter pilot is dangerous, in my opinion."
Helicopters,2ahsud,leakyconvair,2,Sat Jul 12 13:03:47 2014 UTC,I hadn't considered that danger. It's a good point.
Helicopters,2ahsud,_--_-___--,1 point,Sat Jul 12 15:28:27 2014 UTC,"Unlikely. The only kinds of jobs you would qualify for as a low timer are flight instruction and, maybe, depending on where you are, tourism flights in an R44 or so. Thing is, for every one of those jobs there are 10-500 applicants willing to do about anything to get a chance at flying. Which definitely includes working on weekends, at night, long hours, in shitty places, etc. So I highly doubt that there is anyone desperately looking to fill such a position.  Even beyond the low-timer jobs, most pilot jobs aren't 5-day a week anyhow. Weekends have no meaning to most of us."
Helicopters,2ahsud,R0T0R,1 point,Sat Jul 12 07:14:47 2014 UTC,"It's not impossible. You could possibly find a small operation with a single pilot (probably the owner) that wants a relief pilot. Would likely be something simple like tours, aerial photo, pipeline patrol, etc.   But honestly, if you have a commercial and not much more than that for hours and experience, it's going to be difficult to even be hired for that.  A commercial rating doesn't mean much in the helicopter world.  Getting CFI/CFII would increase your chances, but do your students a favor and don't instruct unless you really can dedicate yourself to it."

Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,2,Fri Jul 11 15:12:36 2014 UTC,What crops do y'all spray?
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Fri Jul 11 15:39:43 2014 UTC,Corn and soybeans with the occasional pumpkin field.
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,2,Fri Jul 11 15:45:33 2014 UTC,"Sugarcane and soybeans around my parts, we have two r22 operators, an r44, and a bell 47 as well as the knucklehead pt6 Ag cat operators."
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Fri Jul 11 15:51:17 2014 UTC,Spraying with a 22.  LOL
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,2,Fri Jul 11 21:08:46 2014 UTC,"Tiny guys, they say they're hauling 40 gallons."
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Fri Jul 11 21:46:57 2014 UTC,Sounds painful
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,1 point,Sat Jul 12 00:53:03 2014 UTC,Yeah I'm not quite sure how they're getting away with it. It's almost as asinine as spraying crops with a MD500 or a 300C... no freaking swath and they auto about as well as a brick shithouse.
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Sat Jul 12 02:18:10 2014 UTC,At that point you might as well just use an airplane.  It'll be a cheaper waste of time.
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,1 point,Mon Jul 14 14:36:19 2014 UTC,"Depends what you are spraying. 5 mile runs of fungicide on corn is best handled with an airplane, but anything where you do not want to douse the entire county, copters or nothing."
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:54:37 2014 UTC,Use a huey if youve got 5 mile runs.  Some of our stuff can be 2.5 miles and the 58 does just fine.  Airplanes do an inferior job bo matter how long the run is.
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,1 point,Mon Jul 14 21:53:26 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily true. If you are blanketing an entire county in fungicide, precision takes a back seat to volume. For the cost of a Huey you could run 3-4 AT602s and cover much more area for almost identical operating costs. I am not arguing that an airplane is as precise, I am arguing that hauling 600 gallons per ship times four when you're close in to your strip is better than hauling 200-300 in a Huey depending upon model. A helicopter will do a more precise job, hands down. Helicopters require more maintenance per flight hour and on fungicides, there is very little benefit from to the foot accuracy. As far as more targeted chemicals such as herbicides or insecticides, twenty airplanes aren't worth one helicopter."
Helicopters,2af4bi,leakyconvair,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:15:30 2014 UTC,Uhhhh.  Youve got that completely backwards friend.
Helicopters,2af4bi,Cropgun,2,Tue Jul 15 03:51:17 2014 UTC,Didn't realize you weren't op. I have two local r22 operators a 47 and a 44 apart from pt6 Ag cats.
Helicopters,2afofj,Coldbaconannihilator,4,Fri Jul 11 16:09:08 2014 UTC,"what country are you in?  From a canadian POV there is no such thing as a 'fire fighting pilot' for the most part most canadian pilots fulfill a lot of roles, and yes that means in the summertime you might get on a fire.   why do you specifally want to fight fire, that sure cuts down on a lot of other work out there.  the road to becoming a good long line pilot, is long and tedious with very low pay and lots of time away from home living in shitty ass camps.  really I wouldn't reccomend anybody ever become a helicopter pilot, its really not a good job, you really gotta put in 15-20 years befor it becomes a gravy train.   I see a ton of young guys every year who just dumped 70-80K into flight training with out a clue what they just signed them selves up for and what this industry is really about. most of the time they have these bullshit cliches engrained into them like ""I just love flying"" thats fine, keep it as a hobby not a profession, I love welding but I dont wanna make a living doing that."
Helicopters,2afofj,motorolaradio,2,Fri Jul 11 16:30:07 2014 UTC,PS - where abouts are you workin?
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,1 point,Fri Jul 11 16:47:47 2014 UTC,"I'm in the US, the guy I was talking too was fighting fires during fire season and then I think in the off season he does tours and flight training and helicopter for hire. I would be open to just about anything really from medvac to drying cherries. I have no problem with traveling and in fact I am currently working out of state so I am use too being away from home.  I totally agree with your last statement and thats why I'm here asking these questions is because I too also like welding but have no thoughts grandeur for it being anything but a hobby.  I guess for me I'm 21 don't have anything that I really feel passionate about as far as a career option and feel like I should make a proper decision whether or not I should continue in my current occupation that pays well but has no direction or have something I can do too build myself as a person and hopefully a comfortable living. Sorry if it seems like I'm maybe defending myself I'm just going to play the devils advocate."
Helicopters,2afofj,motorolaradio,3,Fri Jul 11 16:52:42 2014 UTC,"I would say if you have a good well paying job now, keep it. It is really hard to explain to somebody what this job is like with out just going out there and doing it, which is a very expensive lesson.  what I can say is that no matter what you wanna do flying, medvac, seismic, off-shore, fire suppression, skiing, exploration, corporate, all these jobs have ridiculous minimum hour requirements, usually 2000 hr PIC, that's before IFR, multi-engine ect. so you really cant even do any 'real' work for the first 5 years (minimum) of your career. Thats at 400 hours per year, most young pilots I know in canada barely get 200 and they get the absolute shittiest jobs out there and very very shitty pay.  e-mail your buddy and invite him out for a beer, thats the best way to get some real info"
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,2,Fri Jul 11 17:07:46 2014 UTC,I was thinking about doing the training while at my current job. Unfortunately I am living in a different city and he is currently on a fire job. I think next time I'm around I will definitely have to get him a brew and talk helicopters.
Helicopters,2afofj,motorolaradio,1 point,Fri Jul 11 17:17:01 2014 UTC,"Hit the nail on the head, so far as Canadian commercial helicopter pilots go.  Probably the closest you could come to ""guaranteeing"" you fly primarily fires in the summer is to dedicate all you efforts to becoming a) longline proficient, b) a medium or heavy pilot. You'll still have lots of other roles in the off season though. I think maybe the 205/212/214 pilots have it best if they work it so they fly heliski in the winter and fire contracts in the summer."
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,3,Fri Jul 11 16:42:33 2014 UTC,"true, but you can still have a very good summer flying A-star or 407s. Heavys dont really fly much unless its a massive fire, and thats a job for high time guys who are already established.  The fire game is good when its good. but sitting on spec for 3-4 weeks sucks, only to get picked up on 3 day hires, getting punted all over the province, 14hr duty days (realistically 16-18) 4 hour averaged mins...""yea you flew from 8 to 12 today, good. have fun sitting on your flight step for another 9 hours in the smoke, heat and bugs"" not to mention some of the shitty camps, 100+ people with 2 showers ... dont get me started on the type 3 crews either."
Helicopters,2afofj,CrashSlow,1 point,Fri Jul 11 16:55:36 2014 UTC,"Oh definitely, I'm not denying that at all. It just seems like so far as available options, it's a lot easier for a light/intermediate pilot to get put on other work (drill moves, pipeline, mining, etc etc), whereas there are fewer likely non-fire assignments for a Bell medium driver in the prime summer months.   I hear ya about working spec though! Averaged mins don't help either... Luckily, the last time I worked fires it was in Peace River, I lived there, and the company had us in the ASRD rotation so there wasn't any sitting around in bumfuck nowhere (any worse than Peace River could be, obviously!)"
Helicopters,2afofj,CrashSlow,1 point,Fri Jul 11 19:41:48 2014 UTC,"That pretty much sums up fires in canada.  I remember sitting in Castlegard 44C.  We where told not to go into the tanker base to cool off.  If was for ""tanker pilots"" only.  We had to sit in the baking heat under our heli's. BCFS could give two shits if you get heat stroke."
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:19:19 2014 UTC,"Mediums pilots don't get paid any better.   Just remember there fuel pumps are heavier, bucket is 250lbs, longing is 100lbs.  Its hard work flying a medium.  The same money can be made flying a jet buggy..."
Helicopters,2afofj,CrashSlow,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:15:15 2014 UTC,"Last time I checked, flight pay for medium pilots was significantly more than a 206. At least at the companies I've been to.   Besides, at 6'2"" plus helmet, I'd much rather be cooped up in a 205 all day than my cramped little jet buggy cockpit! Lifting heavier ops gear is the least of my worries."
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:50:16 2014 UTC,140k jet buggy drives on the wet coast.     Depends on what your doing.  I know medium drives making less than a lease site to lease site r44 pilot.  Numerous companies dangling the medium carrot to young guys.  Supply and demand......
Helicopters,2afofj,CrashSlow,1 point,Tue Jul 15 00:28:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah all true. But I would venture to call those outliers, and I imagine that's because they're not flying as many hours for whatever reason. They drawback of being a more ""specialized"" machine, I suppose.   For sure you can make more as a 44 pilot in the patch if you're flying your bag off, and even more as a pilot operator.   But OP was specifically interested in fire suppression, that's why I brought it up."
Helicopters,2afofj,HeliBif,1 point,Tue Jul 15 01:44:34 2014 UTC,"Should mention then, many medium drives take the same risk as the helicopter owner and only get paid when the aircraft is hired on.  No fires, NO pay.  How many bell mediums guys starved the last couple summers....."
