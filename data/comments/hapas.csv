hapas,3e67bj,incelmanlate20s,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:16:12 2015 UTC,"I for one when going to high school here in Silicon Valley felt the pressure to compete with my full Asian peers while at the same time be underestimated by them because I am half White. I think the dual cultures that we Hapas have further complicates the stereotypes placed on us. If you try to conform to these stereotypes it will inevitability cause you to be unhappy with yourself. The best thing is to embrace your own identity rather than feel pressured to fit in a certain stereotype. I was very frustrated with the lack of social life at my high school where students would always obsess about their grades, and trying to game the system to get into colleges. In contrast in college the people act more maturely and I talk about more normal things with my new friends here than I did in high school."

hapas,3e5wsb,EurasianTiger,2,Wed Jul 22 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, it all fits together like a puzzle. That's why just out of principle, whilst I'm in Asia, I ONLY buy from Asian shops and Asian brands. Afterall, you buy from McDonalds and what happens? That money goes straight back to America, in some fat guy's pocket. When things become a level playing field however:  1) The number of Westerners in Asian will dwindle, since they will be outsiders, won't speak the language and won't be able to take advantage of effectively living like millionaires 2) Western brands/business won't have as much of a hold, hence big office blocks in Asia won't be filled with rich, white sexpats 3) Since Asians will be richer, then of course, by it's very nature, the appeal of (ugly, moribdly obese, borderline pedophile) rich white foreigners will be less, hence wm/af will decrease, and am/wf will increase  No joke, if in my lifetime the whole 70 year old sexpat phenenomem with some Thai girl who looks like a kid vanishes, then this hapa will die happy..."

Like a 4% difference; I believe one day we'll see a tie.  Same as white Americans are different from ethnic Europeans. Ethnic Europeans can be described as warm, friendly, happy, nearly egoless, child-like, genuine, humanitarian, nature lovers, peace lovers, annoyed by pride, annoyed by cheerful smiles, etc. Most importantly: this idea of a 'creepy white male' seems to not exist in Europe, if it does exist it's so uncommon it's irrelevant. The 'creepy white man' is ubiquitous in the United States. This was an extreme shock to me that my view on race was dramatically modified.   Cultural programming can modify the conscious state of the people and create a new collective unconscious. Race is not immune to cultural programming, although important, race is only a component of the equation. I think now I understand European anti-Americanism better, because Americans are actually alone in much of the negative social behaviors exhibited."

They stick with their wives and don't divorce for frivolous reasons. Oh and they don't cheat on their wives (generally speaking).  IMO this is why the crime rates are low amongst Asians and the IQs are high. It has been proven that Asian men are the most loyal to their families, compared to other races. Interestingly the race with the highest infidelity also has the lowest IQ scores and highest crime rates."
hapas,3e0vts,ready2run,4,Tue Jul 21 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find Asian men attractive, but I generally find non-white men attractive. I just like guys with a darker complexion. Additionally, I find it much more likely that I will relate to men of color on racial issues and the like. This is a big thing for me. I couldn't see myself dating a guy who said things like ""I don't see race, I'm colorblind"" or ""White privilege isn't real.""    It has been proven that Asian men are the most loyal to their families, compared to other races. Interestingly the race with the highest infidelity also has the lowest IQ scores and highest crime rates.   Wow. I wonder which group you could be talking about...?  Your father is Asian and your mother is white, right? I thought children from that pairing were supposed to be more ""enlightened"" about race...  Edit: Maybe it is just me, but the more I read this sub, the more disturbing comments I come across. It is disheartening.

But top tier Asian guys look better than top tier white guys IMO.

Because asian men don't say shit about their struggles, and as a result most people dont know anything about the problems that asian men face it's up to asian men to let the world know what they are going through. White people sure as shit aren't going to acknowledge the shit they do to asian men.   Why are white Americans more empathetic to the struggles of black people? They dont really care, like you said they lose that empathy the moment they think a black person is going to get something, it's just to promote the 'benevolent white person' image, when in reality whites are the most savage and murderous group of people on earth.   Middle class white men are painted as victims by FOX news.  This honestly makes me laugh, these people try so hard to play victim.

hapas,3dwpwg,bkruse96,5,Mon Jul 20 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"Eurasian Tiger you overgeneralize. Personally even with my parents its sometimes hard to relate being mixed to my parents but I still know they tried. My parents tried to instill some level of empathy into me especially with my Mom who is very religious and raised me in the Church. Now I am not that religious but those values are still ingrained in my mindset of the World. I think a lot of guys are not empathetic because we are taught that to be masculine you have to not show any emotional vulnerability otherwise that makes you effeminate. Its more that we are conditioned to present ourselves as tough and since there are a lot of Hapas who come from broken households or are sheltered to believe that they are unique so it comes to no surprise that once they are exposed to the outside World it is hard to connect or relate to other people in a World that views us as outsiders. The key is not to dwell on differences but to embrace them. There are well adjusted Hapas out there but even still a lot of us Hapas have our own unique issues that is hard for non mixed people to understand. Even still we should not have a exclusionary attitude towards other people. I think Eurasian Tiger your troubled childhood has led you to have a very cynical view of the World and it makes perfect sense why you feel that bitter. I can't tell you to be happy if you have no reason to be so but I think you can't use your experiences to generalize the lives of other people. For one thing I can definitely emphasize with some of your experiences and even if my experiences were not as extreme as yours I still have faced mental illness in my own family and even with myself. I understand how much of a stigma it is, but at the same time I still believe that you can improve yourself. I cannot control the fact that mood disorders run within my own family but I can control how I decide to live out my life. I would rather learn from my experiences, reflect, and move on with my life. Since I have gone off the deep end with depression I can definitely emphasize with the experiences of people who are facing depression. However its a matter of choice if you want to live out your life positively. Admittedly I still have phases of self doubt, and episodes of depression. I hide it in public but sometimes it shows especially in my family where we avoid our problems until they explode. However I still know I have autonomy to control my life and not obsess on my issues. The fact that I can relate a lot to you means something. At least for me I am not afraid to be outspoken, and can communicate my emotions to those around me. I am sorry your life has gone the way it has gone but you can always change it. My Mom had a very traumatic childhood and she still grapples with the legacy of it but she still wants to live out her life. So if you are going to say WMAF cannot emphasize with the experiences of being a Asian/Hapa guy that is completely not true.  Now am not saying my parents are perfect. Of course not, they have their flaws and there are certainly things I disagree with them. However its a matter of perspective ,and if you are humble enough to admit your own issues and move on with your life. I find it really cheap to externalize all of my problems when I know when I am depressed it is my self pity that gets in the way. I know I have to take myself less seriously to grow as an individual and you should try to do that too."
hapas,3dwpwg,EurasianTiger,2,Mon Jul 20 05:34:43 2015 UTC,Again with the wall of text.  You're naive. Eventually you're going to come face to face with reality. You think your life is meaningful - think again. You're just the product of sexual selection in favor of white males.
hapas,3dwpwg,bkruse96,4,Mon Jul 20 15:56:33 2015 UTC,I don't define my life based on who my parents are attracted to. That is the big difference between us.

hapas,3dwpwg,bkruse96,4,Mon Jul 20 16:26:29 2015 UTC,I know a lot about myself already and I am a lot more driven than other people my age who have no clue what they want to do with their life. So I do have direction of who I want to be as a person. I have the self respect for myself to try to live out my life and set high goals for myself. I do not see anything wrong with that. I try to live out my life positively because I only have this one life. I do not want to be some melodramatic person who wastes my life away complaining and brooding. I have been there and done that and I know I am better than that. I am a flawed person but I accept who I am as an individual. I already have figured out who I am and my identity is fluid and can grow as well.

That's what all groups in power do, they look after their own.  If you don't fit mainstream society and isn't one of the few groups accepted by them you should forget about empathy and focus on other methods to get what you want."

Japan is actually a great country for children overall.*   Japan is a signatory of many international conventions which aim to protect the rights of children.  There are various domestic laws to promote children’s well-being.  Almost all children in Japan are covered by health care insurance.  Families with small children which do not have a high income level can receive an allowance from the government.  Local governments support pregnant women’s and infants’ health and give advice to them.  Schools also provide health examinations.  Parents are obliged to have their children attend primary and secondary schools for nine years.  The government provides this mandatory education free of charge.  There are provisions which punish acts that harm children, both in special laws and in the Criminal Code.  There is a juvenile justice system which is separated from the normal criminal justice system.   http://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/japan.php"
hapas,3dx1sx,incelmanlate20s,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:16 2015 UTC,I won't deny the fact that the standard of living is extremely high in Japan. However the legal system should address this issue. A child should still have contact with their parents and should not be forced to pick sides in a divorce hearing. Unfortunately these issues are all too common in divorced couples. My Dad has a friend who was married to a Japanese woman and the same exact thing happened to him. He is no longer able to see his son who is stuck in Japan. Not surprisingly my Dad's friend is also a Caucasian American so that further complicates the custody of his son due to the lax extradition policies of Japan.

I probably will reproduce but my beef is with that fact that my child, and myself to a lesser extent, will be considered unworthy by a significant portion of society, of reproducing. Which is what dating is - a preamble to reproduction.  And unfortunately as hard as one pushes to eliminate white supremacy - it still will exist. It exists in everyone's mind simply because of the way White people look. You will have envious women, women who want a white male to increase their status, etc. It's entirely disingenuous and amoral.  Frankly as long as whites exist there will be others who kowtow and suck up to them, and it's up to WHITES, no other people, to disengage from these people and deny their privilege - which is what Hapas need to do as well; to say fuck off to our parents who think we're better because we're white.  But most whites and most Hapas would never do that. Why would they relinquish their privilege? Even the most liberal whites would never do that. And so as long as they're around they're largely going to be worshipped, and it's going to continue causing massive rifts in society like the one that exists among Asians, rifts that will probably ultimately end in violence like what's happening right now with Arabs and blacks on TV, right now as we speak."

Similarly to how we've seen male Hapas act out. Black children literally come in contact with racism the second they come out of the womb; 2 year old children get called ""niglets"" to their faces. Is that not something that would install a severe nihilism in their brain?  You absolutely cannot deny a certain segment of men the right to the same things that whites get easily. I'm sorry, but that's the brutal truth.   Even if you say that they should accept that it is ""unfair,"" then whites should accept that it is ""unfair"" that black Americans act out violently and some whites get caught in the crossfire. White America decided a long time ago that blacks were worthless and blacks are just responding in kind.  Not difficult to understand.

hapas,3dp0fy,EurasianTiger,3,Sat Jul 18 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"White culture. I was raised by a poor white family, my mom's family. Being poor, white and rural there were no Asians around. And my mom didn't try to expose me to Asian culture, mainly because she was poor and depressed. Hell I would be depressed too if my husband died and I had to move back in with my parents who lived on a redneck country rd 2 hrs from a city (and 4 hrs from a major city with an airport). My mom didn't even know how to drive, so she was really fucked.   We moved back in to a city when I was 8. My mother had obtained a position at a university and the income allowed her to afford an apartment in an affluent area. It was a mostly white neighbourhood.  My school had only a handful of Asians and blacks, and to this day it is still 75% white."
hapas,3dp0fy,ready2run,3,Sat Jul 18 03:44:53 2015 UTC,I relate more to my Asian side despite the fact I am not very fluent in Korean. I grew up in a pretty White area myself but over time I saw myself more as a outsider in my community. I used to identify myself more as White due to that upbringing but that changed when I moved to Taipei where I was exposed to my Asian side. Living in California I attended a high school in a community that is 65% Asian and I found it easier to fit in the culture here. I live in one of the most if not most Asian cities in the US so its a interesting dynamic in contrast to my upbringing in Texas. The city I live in is a affluent Asian community but I live on the border with another larger city that is more diverse. The SF Bay Area is pretty awesome being Asian and the level of diversity here definitely beats living in Texas. I am very proud of my Korean heritage but the fact that my Mom did not teach me the language frustrates me especially since I am immersed in Korean culture now and had to learn some Korean on my own. Still I would rather identify as Asian because I never felt fully accepted as White and as a result I can better relate to the Asian American experience than being White. I feel more as a minority person than I do being White even though I admit I benefit from White privilege from my high upper middle class socioeconomic status. In fact most of my friends are Asian American.

I grew up in a white neighborhood so there weren't any other asian kids.   My friends have always been predominately white, any asian relatives I have are overseas, and I don't speak Chinese.  Yes, it is a little offensive, perhaps I would have identified better with my asian side but that choice was effectively taken away from me by my parents."
hapas,3dp0fy,arb10280,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:06:49 2015 UTC,"What exactly is ""white culture?"" I think it needs to be defined clearly; firstly, American culture is not white culture, to put it boldly: it's a business culture based on scientific materialism. American ""culture"" or English speaking countries outside of Europe had a lot of influence from immigrants such as Jews and Blacks.  Real white culture is a mix of architecture, sculpture, floriculture, oil painting, traditional dancing (e.g. Polish, German, Russian dancing), perhaps a bit of ethnic European spirituality. I have doubts that hapas (or even most white Americans) have any mastery of two or more of those areas. What if you didn't know both white or Asian culture if you only choose white culture, you basically chose a soulless economic system disguised as ""culture.""  So I guess study your exact European roots and your own Asian roots. In Canada, Murica and Australia, some of the buildings are just cement blocks the designs look so bland and depressing, it's nothing compared to East-Asian and classical European architecture. I recommend knowing both."
hapas,3dp0fy,polynexus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"White culture, and no. It was probably more the result of growing up in the USA than anything else.  And usually, in most households, it's the mother that keeps the culture and traditions. I had a white mother, so the culture was white."
hapas,3dp0fy,QuietObserver42,0,Mon Jul 20 15:25:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I was raised in Asian culture while under the impression that I was better because I had a white father. I was showed off like an accessory but still lead to believe that I was Chinese.
hapas,3do0ha,hapainhiding,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:20 2015 UTC,I was born in the Philippines. These kids remind me how my life could have been. My mom wasn't a prostitute but she was very poor. My dad was in the U.S. Army. She contacted my dad when she found out she was pregnant. My dad saved up money and brought us to the U.S. when I was two years old.   These kids look a lot like the half-Filipino kids that I know right now growing up in the U.S. It pains me and angers me just to think about.  There was this one time that my dad tried to convince me that the former U.S. occupation of the Philippines was a good thing and I almost started breaking shit. He understand exactly how I feel about it and now we rarely talk about race or politics.
hapas,3do0ha,EverettEvergreen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:52:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess you were the lucky ones in some ways...in fact, your story is basically the same as mine (and I guess millions of others), except it was my gran rather than my mum, and she was from Malaysia (when it was still poorer, and a British colony...) rather than the Phillipines. I'm not really sure what happened, since my mum was put up for adoption the before she was even born, and I'm pretty sure they'd got divorced within at most a couple of months of my gran arriving in Britain. Lol, I guess that's like the stereotypical ""they'll divorce once they've got their green card"" argument haha.   Actually, it's kind of ironic, since right now I'm in Chinatown in Malaysia...I don't think he has a kid with her, but the old Chinese guy (say 70) who owns the hotel is actually married to a Filipino woman, probably around 40 lol  But out of interest, how old are you know, how is your relationship with both your mum and your dad, and...are they still together?"
hapas,3do0ha,TranceFan95,2,Sat Jul 18 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'm 23 now. My parents haven't been together since I was about 8 or 9. I was always glad about this because they would argue all time. They are too different and I always understood this. I would think very harshly of them. I got into a lot of trouble when I was younger I was probably very difficult for them to raise. I rarely spoke to them about anything growing up.    My relationship with them has gotten better as I got older because I understand them better. They still don't understand my perspective at all so we don't talk about very much. They both had hard lives and did the best they could.  I started appreciating my privileges here compared to my family in the Philippines and I send money back whenever I can. I still talk to my dad a few times a week, my mom lives further away but I see her maybe 2 or 3 times a month. I plan to make some good memories with them in the future."

So since they're divorced, what's happened now...has your mum re-married? And what about your dad...don't tell me he's gone and got another Filipino woman lol?  It's strange though man, because even though the hapa issues were always bubbling away under the surface (for example, even from the day I was born, I've always realised that the words ""Asian"" and ""man"" put together was an ugly combination, as well as never calling my dad ""dad"" - I'm pretty sure that's because subconciously I realised I didn't look like him, so hence never developed a close bond), it wasn't until I was much older (say 15 or 16) that I started to actually question their relationship more (how he'd always make comments like ""japs are weird as fuck"", ""I'm not wathing these slanty-eyed chinks"" or ""look at that...gooks taking over the uni"" etc). Like you though, I never spoke to my parents about anything growing up, which is obviously a sign that there's no bond between the child and the parents. ..  But out of interest though, do you have any examples of particularly racial conflicts...maybe your dad being racist for example? See, I guess that's the thing...since ultimately those war marriages are nothing more than a woman's desire for a better standard of living (although at the sacrifice of leaving behind her friends, family and sense of belonging...), at least your mum probably doesn't hate or look down on Asians...does she?"

But I'm not sure if abortion is legal, but you realise why most of these women are actually quite happy to have the kid? Ultimately they're clinging on to the hope that ""if I have his kid...maybe he will support us"". And if the guy is a cunt and never contacts her again, then hey, the kid is just one of thousands living side by side in the slum. Unlike here in the west, where we lock ourselves in our own houses as soon as the work day is over, in those kind of poor/slum environments, because 1) a lot of people don't work and 2) because the space is a lot smaller, with a lot less privacy, then everyone knows everyone. I mean, each day they'll sit around for hours in groups of 30 eating dinner...the whole issue of having an ""abscent father"" is probably fairly low really, considering they're effectively raised in a massive family of friends anyway...

Admittedly though, I've been here for 3 weeks and seen no more than 3 or 4 of each, so they're pretty fucking rare. I mean, many of the Indian girls are beautiful, but I though that the kind of wm in Malaysia would be the kind who would EXCLUSIVELY go for Chinese (since Malays are Muslim, so wm wouldn't go for them). You know, the kind that claim ""western women are feminazi whores...Asian women still act like women"" etc  Still, on a bit of a side note, something that I've found funny is that despite tourists only being say 0.0001% of the city's population, I've seen MORE tourist couples involving a non-white man with a white woman, than I've seen of white men with locals, despite the fact local women make up 99.9999% of the population, versus female tourists being 0.0001%. Just LOL at that haha  And something else that I find funny is you know the whole ""western women are shallow and materialistic"" crap, these EXACT same guys, 6ft2, 20 stone, 60 years minimum and looking like a pedophile are being dragged around the shopping malls against their will by their under 5ft, malnourished, 7 stone 'girlfriend' who looks underage into the Gucci, Prada and Rolex stores.

They don't go to places like South America, or the Middle East because they know they can't compete with the men there so they go to East Asia where they can get a self-hating Asian woman to worship them.

hapas,3dkv1p,EurasianTiger,3,Fri Jul 17 04:14:09 2015 UTC,"I think the war had a lot to do with it, the whole asian male emasculation really started after WWII then continued with Korea and Nam. Look at all the movies from the 80s and how they tried to stigmatize Russia during the Cold War."
hapas,3dhfom,septembergenesis,2,Thu Jul 16 08:22:16 2015 UTC,"There are always going to be some girls of any race attracted to individuals regardless.   Are any races more hapa leaning generally? Hapa girls, although my sample size is small, seem very interested. Asian girls, specifically first generation ABCs with a more asian upbringing, or FOBs who have been in the US a while. Some of these asians are probably closet white worshipping who see us as ""white lite"", and more acceptable to their family. Very Americanized ABCs, 2nd or 3rd generation, seem the least interested.  For me, most interest comes from white and asian girls. I've dated white, hapa, asian, indian, kazakh but never any Latinos or middle eastern. They either aren't interested or I'm missing it."
hapas,3dhfom,arb10280,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:06:07 2015 UTC,A lot of Asian girls think that being mixed is really attractive from my own experience. Some White girls also think that being Hapa is attractive especially those who are very interested in Asian culture. I am not sure about middle eastern chicks though but I know some middle eastern/south Asian girls who are obsessed with kpop/k dramas.
hapas,3dhfom,bkruse96,3,Thu Jul 16 08:27:00 2015 UTC,"I agree I'm south Asian (often mistaken for being middle eastern if that means anything) and I find hapas really attractive, although I've never been into kpop and the sort.

hapas,3dhfom,namecrossedout,0,Thu Jul 16 10:33:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of Asian girls think that being mixed is really attractive   Yep, and they're the kind of girls you shouldn't fuck even if they were the last women on Earth. Afterall, the reason they think they're ""more attractive"" is because of internalised racism, where they think that adding a few drops of white = better looking kids. Make no mistake though, if a hapa guy has kids with an Asian girl, the kids will come out looking near enough 100% Asian lol. Let's be honest, they're the kind that would say ""I'd date a half-Asian guy...but not a full Asian one"". Any hapa who takes advantage of the very same white supremacy that sets them back is equally, if not WORSE than Asian girl who proudly claims ""I only date white guys"" or whatever lol"

He's a good friend, but a bit of a cunt, since I'm pretty sure he took advantage of the ""hafu"" factor with the gaijin hunters back in Japan lol    without the backbone to face the backlash from their family   And that's the thing...how many Asian women are there out there with Asian guys, but deep-down would prefer a white guy, if there was no one else in the world left to judge? I'm pretty sure it's a lot of them...   Worst still are the asian women who use hapas to test the water before moving on to a full WM.   But lol, I've never seen that, though I can DEFINITELY imagine! Actually, I don't wanna sound arrogant, but I'd consider myself pretty good-looking (say 8/10) and have been told I'm attractive by random girls on the street...I mean, whilst on an individual level, I love it, the thing that I fucking hate is being a mini ""poster boy"" for hapas. That's the thing though...I HATE when an Asian girl says she finds me hot, since that's just making her more open to wanting a white guy and snubbing Asian guys. Actually, it's kind of like this quote, from HapaFeminism blog:   ""I must live with my Mother’s legacy. She is the reason I run from being Asian. I don’t want to be an Asian woman of her type. I would rather be the spoiled, bitchy, demanding, Feminist, White woman, my parents despise. I don’t want to be called beautiful and exotic by my enemies.

hapas,3ddhgp,arb10280,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"The site lets women search for a whole bunch of stuff, physical characteristics, interests, income. Both profiles were identical in this regard.  Women can tell ethnicity when their search returns profile summaries. At that stage they can view the full profile and it is these views which get logged. Women are declining to view the hapa profile at this point.  Personally, I wouldn't click on photo less profiles but I'm a guy. Apparently some women don't care if the profile matches their other criteria."
hapas,3ddhgp,EurasianTiger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, if a woman searches for ""white only"" the hapa profile is still returned.

hapas,3ddhgp,TranceFan95,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"Though isn't that more likely down to how to search engine works, rather than hapas themselves (if there's no photo). Afterall, if a white woman selects that she's looking for a white guy, then I'm pretty sure the search engine would return the full white guys at the top of the list, with the guys ticking white + another race at the end.   Though I agree, most hapas are ugly imo. They often end up with a fucked-up mismatch of features...you know, say Asian eyes and a natural tan, but then light brown hair. It's the same with half-white/half-blacks, who often come out eg with dark skin but light eyes. Just fucking weird really lol"
hapas,3ddhgp,pork_orc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"I thought so too but that's not the case. The hapa profile triggers a hit even if the search criteria is ""white only"" OR ""asian only"". This is actually worse as the hapa profile will come up more often than the white profile yet the views are way lower."
hapas,3ddhgp,frenris,0,Wed Jul 15 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"But then if the profiles were IDENTICAL, then it's GOT to be down to the search engine results. I mean, I've never used a dating site, but I'm guessing that you wouldn't actually see the person's ethnicity until you're actually on the ""about me"" section on their profile. What I'm saying is that if there are no pictures, women are clicking on the profiles without actually knowing whether they are pure white + white and something else. In other words, since they don't know that the guy is a hapa when they're cliking on the photos, that means the disparity MUST be down to how the search engine works.   Actually man, you'd be better off using something like Tinder (since it's simpler, faster and allows you to instantly connect with 100x the girls) and swiping right on every girl, one profile using a hapa guy, the other using an equally attractive white guy. Swipe right for say 5 days until your limit is up (I think you get 100 swipes a day...?), so that's say 500 profiles, then see how many matches you get (ie how many of the 500 you liked, also like you back), for both the white guy and Asian guy. When I'm back in England, I'll do the same and let you know the outcome! That'll be an interesting social experiment!"
hapas,3ddhgp,TranceFan95,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"The site I used lets you specify race as a search criteria. The search returns a list of profile summaries which includes ethnicity. At that point you can click to see the full profile. Let's say ""white only"" is the search criteria, both profiles will be returned so it seems women are ignoring the hapa profile at that stage.  You might be right with Tinder as it's photo based. Looking ""white enough"" does seem to buy extra credit with some women. I'm definitely curious to see how our results compare, maybe England won't be so bias."

That's the thing though, unless you live in a heavily mixed area (which I don't), then the ONLY mixed people you see are the good-looking ones - ie the ones in the media, or as used as examples. For example, Jhene Aiko (who looks mainly black imo) for blasians:  http://hw-img.datpiff.com/m15f39c9/Jhene_Aiko_Unreleased-front-large.jpg  I mean, your logic is fucking dumb. Afterall, for 99.999% of the human existance, we've been living in tribes of a few hundred people, hence fucking our own family. Since that's the reverse of hybrid vigour, using your logic, we should all be mutants with downs syndrome or some shit...  And besides, for the supposed like 0.1% difference in DNA between the races (or whatever people claim), the societal impacts, as discussed on r/hapas which lead to a 2x higher rate of depression for mixed-people (and 4x higher for Eurasians) FAR outweighs any minor 'hybrid vigour' benefits, which I personally doubt exist. That's like some bullshit pseudoscience that acts as an excuse for white supremacy. Afterall, how many Asian girls do you hear saying ""I prefer Indian guys""? Yeah, not fucking many lol"

Why would I need to work on my personality?  And something else though, I'd never take online dating surveys as a reliable indicator, since you get a really fucking skewed view due to the sample bias. I mean, those 10/10 guys going down the clubs banging a different girl each weekend aren't gonna be on the dating sites, are they? From what I've seen, most of the guys on there are older, at best average looking, and honestly, kind of desperate...the reality is, that MAJORITY of Asian women aren't considered attractive to them - the 'attraction' simply comes from the perceived view (that has a lot of truth) that Asian women have no standards, hence guys with low self-confidence take the path of least resistance. Lol, you'd be fucking naive to think otherwise, but every white guy married to say a Chinese or Filipino girl deep-down wants the tanned, blonde-bombshells they've grown up dreaming of in the likes of Playboy and Penthouse. Asian women are simply the 'go-to' when all else fails, LOL. That's why I find it strange that Asian women will settle with the nerdy white guys...don't they realise they're just leftovers, like meat left out for the dogs?

hapas,3ddhgp,EurasianTiger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:40 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to be said here.  What dating site were you on?  You said half asked for a photo?  Does this mean your profile had no photos on it?  Women tend to stick to their own races.  There are studies about about it:  http://www.ninjaonlinedating.com/blog/what-are-the-racial-preferences-of-women-on-dating-sites/  Just because overall women stick to their own races, there are a lot of women who are open to dating other races.    It depends on your profile, how you present yourself, photos etc...  Either way, creating a profile and letting women come to you is not a good way to approach online dating.   The dating sites send women their ""daily matches"", women have their own search criteria which can be based on job/kids vs. no kids/want kids/etc...., and much more so your views point to me isn't really a good representation.    The key test would be two have two identical profiles with different pictures and emailing the same women with the same message.  You messaged women and didn't get results but you don't say the type of messages you sent.   If you sent messages that were ""hi"", 'hello"", or ""how are you"" like most men do, you wouldn't do well no matter what race you are.    The key is to tweak your profile consistently until you get results.  If you are confident, humorous, and positive in your dating profile you will do good."

And a black woman who likes white men really wants an authentic black man trapped in a white man's body. Just like how all the black Lesbian relationships I see here in Maryland involve a butch black dyke which is basically a black man trapped in a black woman's body and a feminine black woman. Black society has always been very matriarchal. Black women call the shots in the average black household.

And what does the black community’s suffering have to do with a mixed-race person’s struggles? “Blacks are socially engineered to destroy themselves through gun violence, drugs and AIDS”? That’s a very stereotypical and degrading comment – I do agree with so many of the things you’re bringing up.    I think many (not all!) WMAF or AMWF couples met in academic or otherwise high-standing positions. I can’t imagine many people on here are the children of Asian prostitutes selling themselves at the local bar, and thus, the majority of people in this sub are born to parents who are upstanding and probably relatively sane.   Sure, they pushed their kids. Sure, they might not have done a good job of integrating their Asian pride and culture into their children. And many Asians do view being white as being more well-off, or are aware that looking whiter can lead to more opportunities for their kids. It’s a matter of trying to help the future of their children and doing it poorly, not a matter of being sadistic, fucked-up people looking to terrorize their offspring."

Did his white dad make jokes about chinky Asian men when he was growing up (let's face it most do. I know because I look white and have white friends and hear it all the time)? What does that say about how he sees his hapa son? What racial identity will the son have...he will feel white inside because that's what his white dad taught him...then look in the mirror and see this image of racial humiliation. Imagine feeling white but having people treat you Asian...it would be like a man being confused for a woman or vice versa.  AMWF sons are different. They look Asian, feel Asian, are treated Asian, and have a positive Asian role model in their father to look up to. No mismatch, no recipe for identity crises."

The more Asian a hapa man comes out looking, the more racism he will experience. The more black a mulatta woman comes out looking, the more racism she will experience. There are tons of mixed race black women who don't have the stereotypical attractive mixed look of the thick dark curly hair and super lightskin that you see all the models in advertisements have. The fact that Americans think whiter looking mixed people are better than full-blooded looking mixed race people is white supremacy at work. And white people will never accept you if you're mixed.

She was also fucking depressed and didn't give a shit about her life and I think that's why she never put much effort in to teaching my bro and I about our Korean culture. So now I'm fucked because I'm essentially a white person living in an Asian female body. I experience all the problems of being an Asian female along with the complexities of being a poc raised by white people. I get called a twinkie by way too many people who just don't understand.   I feel as if one of the only advantages of being from a WMAF would be that most of you all know your Asian culture and have been engaged with it since you were little.

My mom always gave the snarkiest answers...looking back it was fucking hilarious.  Worst part is my brother is white passing so no one questioned him. No one asked if he was adopted. It was always me. I remember one person telling me when I was 7 that I was lucky my mom adopted me because she could have bought a car instead.

hapas,3d4tub,Lazu1e,0,Tue Jul 14 06:49:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'd say the opposite to be honest. I mean, generally men are more nationalistic/proud of their race/culture (whereas women generally don't give a shit, and only care about things on an individual level, rather than group level), hence why the VAST majority of 'racists' (ie Stormfront users, nationalist group members etc) are male. Maybe it's biological, or maybe it's environmental, but I think most people would agree that men are more competitive/driven by their ego than women - with that in mind, it's hardly surprising, they want their group to be the best, since it's a boost to their ego!   For example, I know a few am/wf couples, all of which the am is VERY proud of his race. It's kind of a weird situation, but some of the other hapas on here have hinted at it too...for a hapa, and even a full Asian man, to be seen with an Asian woman, they are effectively self-cuckolding themselves. Lol, I live in a like 0.05% Asian area, though I can honestly say the wm/af vs am/wf rate is EASILY 1000:1 (mainly because of mail-order brides, since there aren't really any British-born Asians here)...with that ratio in mind, you realise how much of a cuckold an Asian guy, and in particular hapa guy, looks if he is with an Asian woman? Embarrassed, humiliated and degraded - that's exactly how ANY Asian/hapa guy with an ounce of self-pride should feel if they're chasing Asian women, when Asian women clearly won't hold themselves back for them. You know, it's like someone saying ""I don't want you"" repeteadly, then you STILL keep desperately chasing them...you realise how much of a faggot that makes them look?   That's the thing though, although I may end up moving back to Asia and having Asian kids in the future, Asian men are quite clearly losing the battle here...that's why I'll only be seen with non-Asian girls - to do my bit for Asian and hapa guys! Even if I do have non-Asian kids though, no question, I will raise them to be proud as fuck of Asian culture! Holidays, the media, the language (which I'm currently learning, since my mum was adopted into a white family) and of course the people...if you completely deny part of yourself, either for lack of interest, or because you don't want to remind yourself you're different, then you will never truly be proud of yourself, hence will never be truly happy..."

Maryland can suck because most Asians out here are all Korean and their parents own liquor stores and laundromats. But I live in an integrated suburban town where race is a non-issue for the most part and there are tons of mixed people or all races. In California, Asians are much more diverse are seen as human as anybody else and come from all walks of life. I miss the Bay because in many areas of the Bay, race is a complete non-issue. You see Asians hanging around blacks, Latinos, Samoans, white people and it's no big deal. Some of the most popular local celebrities in the Bay Area are hapa. Equipto, who is a Japanese-Colombian rapper from San Francisco, is one of the most respected local rappers to ever come from there. He has collaborated with some of the Bay's most popular black Rap artists from the same neighborhood like Andre Nickatina and San Quinn.   But there is nowhere like the Bay. I never experienced any racism growing up there. But the ugly downside is that the most integrated and accepting areas in the Bay Area tend to be the most crime-ridden and dangerous. Some of the worst areas of East Oakland are mind-blowingly diverse with Asians living next door to blacks, whites, Latinos, Samoans, Tongans and all different types of mixed people. I miss the integration and unity of the working class/lower middle class urban Bay Area, but I do not miss the danger, the senseless violence and crime. Where I'm from in SF was integrated between blacks and Asians and there was little racial tension growing up there, but the area has since gentrified and now most blacks have been displaced by fob Asians.   What growing up in the Bay as a kid taught me is that race doesn't matter that much. I used to go into Chinatown everyday with my grandparents, but my father's mother lived in Sausalito across the Golden Gate bridge in Marin County, the whitest county in the Bay. If I had been born and raised in an all-white suburb, I might have learned to hate myself. I'm glad I experienced in-your-face racism at the hands of white people in Maryland as well as a teenager to let me know not to put them on a pedestal."

Black women straighten their hair because their natural hair is seen as ugly and ""unprofessional"". Dark skin and typically African features are seen as unattractive in American society. Michael Jackson hated his physical appearance so much that he ended up looking like a real life Anime character. MJ went from being a black man from Gary, Indiana to becoming a rich elderly Korean woman.   Every race and every gender is filled with guilt and positive and negative stereotypes/prejudices. The negative stereotypes and perceptions are what get people to buy shit in our consumer based society. Black men feel like they can overcome by having hundreds of pairs of overpriced slave labor Nikes in crispy condition and having light-skinned black girl or a white girl with a fat ass on his arm. Asian men try to overcome by becoming super successful professionals in high demanding high paying fields to buy more shit and maybe attract a woman. White men try to overcome by using every drug under the sun.   But I'm sick of the hapas coming here to complain. The general stereotype of hapa males is that we are tall and attractive. Type in ""hapa guys are"" into a Google search and the first suggestion is ""hapa guys are hot"". Google search suggestions are ruthless and judgemental, mind you. One of the first suggestions if you type in ""white guys are"" is ""white guys are corny""."

China was more advanced technologically and economically than Europe for approximately 1800 years, it is only in the past 200 years that westerners advanced in science to a high level, because of this it led to a white-world-revolution.

I find very few things in this world are black or white--I think most things are shades of gray. White ethnics may have faced discrimination when they first moved to the U.S., but they were also complicit in racial segregation as that was the way for them to assimilate into cultural whiteness (become ""true Americans"").   Even looking at the trashy articles and video I cited, I imagine there are a a number of underlying trends (economic, social, educational, political, etc)  that predisposition certain groups to commit illegal acts. Even though the above articles seem to insinuate that criminality is inherent to Eastern Europeans (many commentators say as much), I don't agree. Instead, I think a number of the aforementioned trends I asserted earlier are a far more plausible explanation."

I understand why you and many very simple ass white people think this way BUT it's not that simple. You're tying to make things sound more basic than they actually are. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are only in ""white countries"" because Europeans went to their countries first. Europeans created a GLOBAL ECONOMY based on Western capitalism and white hegemony not only in Europe but the entire world. North Korea is the only exception at the moment. White man forced the whole world to become part of their economy. A racially based economy that puts white people at the top and black at the bottom. Asians should stop participating and create their own system because they will always be ""number two"" in this one.   Capitalism has no borders, therefore people from the slums will naturally go to where all the money and prosperity is. Western civilizations would never have that money/influence without exploiting the entire world in the first place. People will continue flooding ""your"" countries if their country is further down on the global economic ladder. There are no more nations left because of you. There are only cultures.   We're all parasites. All I'm trying to say is that white people are parasites too, history shows many many times that whites are actually the best at being parasites because they swallowed up entire resources, civilizations and forced them to either assimilate or die.

And to add insult to injury SJWs and jigs try to flip the script by calling this exodus ""white flight"" insinuating that it's the white people's fault."
hapas,3d51jp,i_r_not_lizard,2,Tue Jul 14 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"Of course not. Those white ethnics are totally innocent. They only squatted on stolen land taken after mass killings, involuntary relocation, and cultural genocide. Absolutely blameless...those poor white ethnics.   Those ethnic groups happily joined mainstream white American culture in denigrating non-whites in order to join their ""rightful place"" with older assimilated white ethnic groups. They didn't kill en masse, but they squatted on stolen land to build up their wealth and were complacent with policies that terrorized and denigrated non-whites. White ethnics were complacent with domestic terrorism committed against non-whites. To be ""white"" was to denigrate/distance yourself from everything considered ""non-white.""  White ethnics have contributed to the U.S. but people of color have not only contributed a great deal to major cities, but to the country as a whole too.   Black people who were enslaved did free labor and their descendants have never been compensated for their work. Even when black people fought for so called ""freedom"" during WWII, captured German soldiers pointed out the hypocrisy of Americans as they practiced segregation in the military.     Asians were treated as perpetual foreigners even though they, specifically the Chinese, were instrumental in laying the foundations for an important form of public transportation, the railroad. This foreigner status has followed Asians for centuries. Look at WWII. Even Japanese families who were in the US for generations were locked up as a security risk during WWII by the US government--just because they were of Japanese descent.  Even today, Americans (mostly White) have a weird phobia about China--I mostly think they are freaked out about a non-white country that may surpass them on the global stage.   Also, white flight is a real thing. I guess housing discrimination against black people is a SJW myth too?  Did black people moving to your family's neighborhood raise the property taxes/rent to the point that your family could no longer afford to live there? That's gentrification in a nutshell.   I'm really interested in hearing how black people forced out your family.

Today, if saw a house that I liked but saw that it was occupied by someone else, I cannot kill the occupants/forcibly relocate them just because I want that house.

Just take a few mins and talk to one of these black men about why they date white women and the answers are all the same.

The only place in America where Asians act like that towards other Asians is in pockets of California and I don't live there anymore.  Why lie? this whole subreddit is angry whiny hapas from well-off families who can't grapple with the fact that they will never be white . Just because you worship white women and they are creeped out by your scary insecurities and identity issues, you think you have the worst struggle in the world. The whole internet laughed at Elliot Rodger because he was a rich good looking guy in one of the richest areas of Cali, but he was a spoiled piece of shit from an upper middle class family like a huge percentage of WMAF hapas. And he was mad that he finally found something that he couldn't get because his safe sheltered life in the shires of Britain and sunny Isla Vista and his $500 shirts from Neiman Marcus and BMW had all been handed to him on a silver platter.   The problem with many hapas is entitlement. You think you are entitled to whiteness because of your father's race and you think you are entitled a good life because most of you come from solid middle class upbringings where you never had to work for shit. It's a combination of the worst family structures of both white and Asian families. In Asia, it is not uncommon for folks to not leave the nest until they are in their early 30's. In most cultures around the world, people don't leave their parent's house until they get married. In America, you probably can't get pussy unless you move out of your parent's house unless you have low standards or a lot of game. But in America, anyone who isn't on their own with their own place, a job and a car and fucking every girl possible by the time he is 18-24 is a loser put up to ridicule. Fathers in WMAF are usually workaholics who make good money (i.e. Elliot Rodger) and don't mind providing for their young adult sons. All of this does not fit the unrealistic hedonistic individualist world view of young people in America to get fucked up everyday and fuck everything you can get your hands on. Elliot Rodger would have been happier if he cut himself off from his parent's money and shiny things, worked for his own keep, got a job as a server and started going to parties with his co-workers and classmates.   It doesn't help that most hapa males want to be seen as white and only like white women. This is actually a turn off because you come off as being ashamed of your heritage when you can be interesting and exotic by embracing your unique life experiences and unique heritage. Since I don't act like a stereotypical white or Asian guy, women of all races love me because I am interesting because I stay true to myself and I know who I am. Race is not the only thing that defines me. And race is not the only thing that defines most people, especially not white people. So of course white girls are creeped out by some mixed dude who clearly worships them for being white and that alone."

hapas,3d2t7s,hapainhiding,0,Mon Jul 13 04:02:04 2015 UTC,Well the fact that the majority of Asian women are with white men is pretty telling about our relative value in the white hegemony. Asian women and only Asian women have massive unbalanced patterns of dating out - representing something about a male group being perceived as of higher value; the eurasian children being nothing but the symbol of another group (Asian men) being culturally discarded.  But I'm guessing you never really thought that one out - did you.   The minute your son gets rejected by an Asian woman for being Asian - where do you think his trust for you will go?
hapas,3d2t7s,Lazu1e,0,Mon Jul 13 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"I mean there are millions of us Hapas - do you think that we literally are just never going to question why Asian women marry white men en masse and finding Asian women that say horrible shit about Asian men is incredibly easy?  How stupid do you think we are?  These are fairly important questions that eventually Hapas en masse are going to have to just ask themselves instead of dancing around the tired ""beautiful and talented"" line forever."

hapas,3d0egf,EverettEvergreen,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read about Chloe Bennett last year about changing her name from her father's last name ""Wang"" to his first name ""Bennet.""  I don't think it's too unusual because other actresses such as Bérénice Lim Marlohe (James Bond Skyfall) also appear to be using a French last name despite having in her case a Cambodian/Chinese father.  You need to adapt to the majority when you're an actor or actress.  It would be different if Chloe Bennet said she wasn't Chinese at all.  In Hong Kong we have Karen Mok who uses a Chinese name there but uses her actual name Karen Morris outside Hong Kong.  The HK actor Anthony Wong has a British father but uses a Chinese surname.  Look at all of the other famous actors and actresses who have parents of different ethnicities that didn't use their actual names such as Raquel Welch (born Jo Tajeda).  Ben Kingsley's Indian father told him he would never get a British acting job if he used his actual name, Krishna Bhanji.  His father knew the odds and actors and actresses have to improve their odds because acting is so competitive.  It would be bad if an actor/actress denied his racial ancestry but changing the name shouldn't be counted against them."

My 2nd cousin who is also Hapa in fact is married to a Hong Kong Chinese woman so I don't get where you are getting that from. In fact Asian girls have shown more interest towards me from my own experiences than White girls. Culturally I also feel I can relate more to Asian girls compared to White girls too. That is just my preference though but your stereotype does not hold true."

And New York.  When I was in New York, people would tell me that it's common to see Asian male-white/hapa female relationships in California.  When I moved in California, then people told me it's common in New York.  Frankly, they are rare everywhere.  They are only common on the Internet."
hapas,3d0egf,ktchong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:14:36 2015 UTC,I live in the Bay Area. Its pretty common here. Of course its a matter of your perspective. Unless you lived in those areas I am not sure you can make a full judgment call on these things. Yes Hapas disproportionately date White people but that is due to the fact that White people are the majority in America. I know other exceptions too. The fact is you cannot just paintbrush people's dating preferences. Yeah AMWF couples are more rare everywhere in the US. WMAF couple much like BMWF couples more common in the US. Look what is your point?
hapas,3d0egf,bkruse96,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:19:53 2015 UTC,"AM/WF couples are rare everywhere in the US.  However, AM/HF couples are even rarer than AM/WF couples in the US.  Among Asian men, hapa girls do have the reputation of only dating white guys.  Do you dispute that?  I am sure there must be at least a few AM/HF couples in existence out there, but they are the rarest of the rarest.  The point is: American society is a factor because it conditions and pressures HF into white acceptance, and the ways of achieving white acceptance is to date and marry WM, adopt white surnames, etc."
hapas,3d0egf,ktchong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:30:03 2015 UTC,"The reality though is because most Hapas in the US are WMAF we already have White surnames, and in this articles case I find it disgraceful she is rejecting her surname in favor of a more western surname to appeal to the white audience. Look you cannot force someone to date one race or another unless they are attracted to them. The same logic you have applies to Hapa males. A lot of Hapa males have preferences for just White girls, so that logic would apply to us too.I dated both Asian girls and White girls. Why are you so fixated on Hapa girls dating preferences when this sub is full of Hapa guys?"
hapas,3d0egf,bkruse96,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:36:31 2015 UTC,"The reality though is because most Hapas in the US are WMAF we already have White surnames...   Because most hapas in America have white dads and Asian moms.  I agree, no one can force someone to date a race.  However,  the society does determine  the playing field of interracial dating.  The media does set the norms of interracial relationships.  I prefer Asian girls overall, (and I think a slight majority of Asian girls do prefer Asian guys.)  I am ""fixated"" on hapas only because I use them to point out the  the underlying racism in interracial dating: the disparity between AF/WM and AM/WF couples, (which is why hapas almost always have white last names,) the extreme rarity of AM/HF couples, the anti-AM sentiment that many hapas have inherited from their Asian moms, etc.   A lot of ""progressives"" love to promote interracial dating and relationships as the antithesis to racism and discrimination.  Yet, the truth is, there is an inherent bigotry in interracial dating and relationships."
hapas,3d0egf,ktchong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:52:11 2015 UTC,"Not in all interracial couples and I find it pathetic you want to date Hapa girl to rant about racism against Asian guys. I am not denying that we Hapas face unique issues that stem from WMAF relationships but its not as if our problems are only constrained to us. Its not as if all White people have perfect home life either. My aunt grew up in a abusive loud household in New Jersey in an Italian American family and it was not perfect for her either. I won't deny the large impact of media in this country but at least in California especially here in the Bay Area because there is so much diversity here interracial dating is fairly common here. Its not as if interracial dating is a silver bullet towards racism but I disagree with the notion that they perpetuate the racist culture in our nation. I won't deny though that there is a higher rate of couples that are WMAF that are based off of terrible motivations. Look as a Hapa guy I faced the same time of stigmas that full Asian guys face so instead of turning against other full Asian guys I don't get why we Hapa guys don't relate to our commonalities. We both face the issues of being emasculated by the media. Its not as if all Hapa girls reject Asian guys all the time though. I know several Hapa girls who are really attracted to Asian guys and also some White girls who are just like that. It all goes to your perspective. I think using Hapa girls as a tool to brood about being a Asian guy is pretty pathetic because I know some Hapa girls who think that being mixed is really awesome, and love Asian culture."
hapas,3d0egf,bkruse96,3,Mon Jul 13 08:03:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, I much prefer honest, blatant, racism and hatred than the passive, closeted racism that goes on. With the latter, it's easy for people to be in denial, stick there head in the sand and nothing ever changes.  I find myself agreeing with much of what Stormfront has to say too. I can't stand these PC mono-racial people who talk about how great race mixing is for society when they are never going to live the life of a mixed person."

I can tell if someone is Korean most of the time but I sometimes mistake some Japanese people for other races. In ancient times the Yaoyi people in Japan descended from ancient people who lived in the Korean peninsula and China. Contrary to the popular belief among Japanese that they are a ""pure"" race they actually in ancient times were a mixture of different people such as the Ainu and other Jomon era people and Yayoi people from the Asian mainland. Its really your preference if you find Japanese people attractive. I find Japanese people also pretty good looking although I personally find Korean girls a little bit more attractive.  That is just my preference though. The funny thing is my Mom is often mistaken for being Japanese and once when I was on ANA a Japanese airline the stewardess spoke to my Mom in Japanese. My Mom knows some basic Japanese so she was able to communicate. However for most Korean people I can tell pretty well based on their eyes and facial structure although Koreans and Japanese look most similar to each other and are part of the same language group. I actually think Korean people look more homogeneous than Japanese people so its easier for me to tell apart most of the time."

Regarding Blacks, there has only been one study where the statistics did not come from self-measurement; a Nigerian study of 115 men came up with 13.37 centimeters. I should also mention that the vast majority of ""world penis size"" comparison charts or even research you see on the internet bases their East Asian statistics on one single South Korean study.

And any white girl can get a black or Asian man any time she wants, except because of media bias, white women usually don't go for Asian men. Where I'm from in the Bay Area, black women/Asian men is much more common. Like Chris Rock said ""Black women don't like white men, but they'll fuck a pretty white man"". And the same goes for white men. They don't like the average brown skinned black woman who works at Social Services but they'll fuck Lauren London. But Lauren London is being courted by the richest black men because attractive light-skinned black women are a hot commodity in the black community. Popular black rappers are always talking about how they want a bad ""redbone"" or a bad ""yellowbone"". Most of the time when I see black women in interracial relationships, the woman is always darker skinned.

A lot of Asian girls think that is awesome that I am mixed, and since I have more Asian features I can identify more with my Asian side because white people pretty much just label me as full Asian. Interestingly enough though Chinese girls show more interest towards me than Korean girls. The thing with my Mom though is she never made an effort to teach me Korean and therefore I had to explore Korean culture on my own. The most cultural thing I am connected to Korean culture is the food. I eat Korean food most of the time, but since my parents are still together for the most part my Mom still acts a bit White. My Mom several times goes off how awesome it is that I am mixed being half Korean and German two very desirable races in her view. As you can imagine it gets a little annoying but for the most part I like hanging out with Korean American people who are 2nd generation. However considering your circumstances it makes more sense why you feel that way, but I think part of the reason why I try to identify more with Korean culture is my own identity issues that my parents have ignored for the most part. My Dad for the most part remains uninvolved with my Korean side and never learned the language and this causes friction between my parents."
hapas,3cxh94,bkruse96,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:27:08 2015 UTC,"Asian female attitudes to hapa guys is very mixed from my experience. The white worshipping ABCs are the most hostile, next are the foreign asians who only date asian and see us as white guys with yellow fever. Then there are the girls, usually foreign or first generation, who desire white men and see us as a more ""culturally acceptable"" stepping stone towards that goal.  For me, asian girls aren't worth bothering with, their motives are never pure. White girls are a lot more upfront about their intentions."

They have been with each other for the last 22 years. I have had to deal with my Mom's neurotic behavior over the years but I can get where she is coming from. She always tried to instill a pride in my Korean heritage, and I am more interested n embracing my Korean side now. Unfortunately divorce seems all too common among interracial couples, but hey the divorce rate in ths US is around 60% so its a whole societal issue that is not constrained to just interracial couples. Regardless we Hapas face unique issues because we are part of two different cultures which sometimes come into conflict."

One of them was my good friend and he got his mother's small asian frame, asian looks and feminine facial features. I used to witness him getting utterly humiliated at high school - having his head repeatedly bashed into lockers in front of girls, tossed and thrown around like a doll etc. He then joined the military and got it even worse and was regularly treated as the inferior beta bitch by all his ""comrades"" and beaten regularly. People just always picked on him wherever he went for being different. He developed a severe complex and would not shutup about how he hated being asian. He's broken for life now."

Just the environment change between Texas and California was a huge change for me. I live in a very Asian American community in the SF Bay Area and there are a ton of Eurasians here. At least in the Bay Area and LA its pretty common to be Eurasian. Contrast this to Texas where I felt like a stranger literally most of the time. Even though my high school years were academically stressful, socially I was able to do better than middle school although I still don;t think I fully lived out my life socially due to academic pressure. Still its a lot better than my middle school years despite making straight A's I was a loner. I realize I have a pretty comfortable life, and I live in one of the nicest areas in the country. I actually just really want to live out my life, and in contrast to some other Hapas I have met in real life I am a lot more extroverted and talkative.

There seems no limit to how much these women will degrade themselves to achieve the ultimate goal of snaring a white boyfriend. The better looking WM know this, fuck the shit out of them, then cast them aside. Ultimately these women give up and settle for whatever white beta faggot they can get."

hapas,3cuzu2,EurasianTiger,2,Sat Jul 11 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"It's worse than ignore. They deny it's even happening.   They (white men and Asian women overwhelmingly) say things like ""I see Asian guys with white girls ALL THE TIME"" when they may mean they saw one Asian guy walking around campus with a white girl years ago who may not have been sexually involved with the dude.  They barely mention the extreme number of WM/AFs populating the world. They deny the obvious Asian females putting Asian men down that happens. They deny the lopsided disparity in portrayals in main stream culture's media.  If this disparity would merely be acknowledged, I would feel better about it from a personal perspective at least. The denial, then the ""rubbing it in your face"" attitude and behavior I see from White men and Asian women ""it's YOUR fault, despite it being OUR racism that's causing it"" is what is extremely grating."

I don't think I'll ever be able to come to terms with the fact that Asian men are considered unbreedable yet I'm still Asian.... something that when it happens in your own family, it's pretty much a terrible curse.

Women come onto men all the time regardless of their personality. My father was come onto by my mother even though he is legit aspie. All that mattered was his white blood.  The fact that he went out and smoked people made him more attractive to you than he otherwise would have been. If he was hot, someone would have come onto him already.

It didn't worked out for him, even some women made fun of him. He had awkward fish lips but he wasn't ugly as hell either.

He says he felt sorry for Elliot but did not feel sorry for his actions because he was a mentally ill guy who despite his privilege committed a terrible mass murder.  Coincidentally my friend is also half Chinese/British American. Look stop obsessing over a psychopath who killed six people. I think its cool if you are attracted to Hapa guys but you are obsessing over a dead, psychopath. That is very low. I agree not all blondes are mean. In my own family I have several cousins who are blonde. I actually really like Santa Barbara a lot and the people there are nice too but for Elliot I think his biggest problem is that he would not open up to anyone and just isolated himself. He had clear mental issues before he ever went to Isla Vista. I have Asian friends who attend UCSB and are having a blast. My problem with your post is that you are worshiping a mass murderer, and that is just plain disturbing."

I think its great to be exposed to your Asian side but from my own experiences when I traveled to Korea, and lived in Taiwan for a year a half people looked at me as a White American. So like the US or other western countries some people still treat you like a foreigner. Add the fact you do not know the native language it makes it a lot more difficult. However living in Asia can be a very positive thing because you are more connected to your Asian side and understand the culture better.  Living in Asia is not a paradise but being mixed is actually seen as a really awesome thing there. In many Asian countries being half White/Asian is considered to be attractive so you definitely get more attention than you do in the US. I actually want to do a study abroad in either Japan, South Korea, or China. I think it would be an enriching experience to live in Asia for a while again."

Its all a matter of how we were raised to believe we are the ""Best of both Worlds"". My Mom always tries to say things to make me proud of being half Korean and she has said a lot in my childhood to be proud of being part of two beautiful races Korean and German. My Mom will go off with how Korean people are the smartest in the World, and for the most part my Dad gets annoyed with her nationalistic sentiments. I can completely relate to the feeling of having parents drive the fact you should be very proud of your circumstances. Its not necessarily completely a bad thing but it does lead a lot of us Hapas to become entitled and when reality hits us we realize that we are not as perfect as our parents try to make us out to be. Sure I am proud of being mixed but I do realize the stigmas and problems that my parents cannot fully relate to of being mixed. I don't blame my parents completely for that but I think being taught to be too prideful being mixed leads to many of us Hapas to have a superiority complex. For the most part though I think being mixed is a positive thing. I just think that instead of trying to instill too much nationalistic pride in being Korean and American my Mom should have actually taught me the language. It would be a lot more helpful to actually communicate properly with my Korean relatives instead of her saying how great Korean people are. The most irritating thing of this reinforcement to be proud of being mixed is my Mom in the past tried to compare me to other mixed guys and full Korean kids with grades and such. My parents are not perfect but I can relate a lot to this post."

Sure, there are external factors that bring people together. I am a white male dating an asian female, and I can assure you that our relationship started from ""just falling in love."" Our relationship started platonically, and got closer from there. I feel that much of this sub is driven by hatred rather than oppression. It's not hard to find people who don't see race, it seems to me that much of this sub is angry that there are asian women who don't find their own race particularly attractive. I personally don't like dating white women; I find them attractive, but much prefer latinos, blacks, and asians. This sort of thing can happen in any race, I've met black girls who aren't attracted to black guys, whatever. That's okay.

The main contextual factor that must be foregrounded is the significance of growing up in predominantly white ethnic neighborhoods and the powerful impact this had on shaping respondents’ subjectivities, fantasies, and intimate desires from a young age. I focus especially on the powerful but conflicted desires for whiteness and white racial privilege that emerged as central themes in the stories of all respondents.16 The attraction of Asians, and other minorities, to the hegemonic gender ideals in the United States has been discussed by a number of scholars. For the men, the hegemonic gender ideals are constituted by what has been referred to as “hegemonic masculinity,” the prime reference point of which is “northern, heterosexual, Protestant father of college education, fully employed, of good complexion, weight, and height, and a recent record in sports,” the only “unblushing male” in America.17 This is of course an ideal that only a few white men can approximate. As for what constitutes hegemonic white femininity, Karen D. Pyke and Denise L. Johnson, in their study of Asian American women and their engagement with white hegemonic femininities, enumerate such qualities as “verbal expressiveness . . . assertiveness, self-possession, confidence, and independence” and espousal of egalitarian beliefs, as opposed to the passive, hyperfeminine, submissive and “compliant” femininity associated with Asian females.18 For most of my respondents, my findings confirm the ongoing strength of hegemonic gender ideals that prevail in growing up in a racially homogenous environment, particularly in molding basic self-conceptions and romantic/sexual desires."

Most caucasians have compressed zygomas, so their cheekbones are closer to their eye sockets, making them high set. However in your case your zygomatic bones seem quite laterally compressed, so i assume they are very medially projecting - but i can't tell very well from the photograph you have supplied us with.  You also have epicanthus folds and your eye orbitals are very large and round. Europeans have smaller squared shaped eye orbits."

Your last few posts have been pure bullshit though. Its mostly WMAF themselves promoting this super Hapa myth, and this subreddit has deconstructed it. We're not complaining about a stereotype of Hapa failure, we are through our own research and personal stories, discovering the FACTS of it ourselves.   The promoting of supposed Hapa superiority is not a celebration of mixedness per se. It is a denigrating of Asian features, and a praise of the ability of white genes to cleanse the Asianess out of offspring. An ability that is false in the vast majority of cases.   Even your ""true blue liberal dad"" showed this tendency when he praised you for your white looking features, implying that Asianess is something to be ashamed of.

The model minority stereotype of Asians was made up by white people in the 60's to stop Asians from forming common cause with blacks. The stereotype of black men being drug dealers was also cooked up in this time period because white Uncle Sam didn't start importing heroin and cocaine into every ghetto in America from Bolivia and Afghanistan until the 60's as a form of population control. MS-13 formed in the 80's and 90's and now the whole Central America is gang controlled and Latino men live with the stereotype that they are all gang members and lawnmower jockeys.   At the end of the day, most ""hapas"" are sons of white men for God's fucking sake. I have lived a much better life because I'm half white.

I think these stereotypes that some Hapa guys think make them ""failures"" is more based on the perception of themselves. Personally I have had phases where I thought I was a failure. Come to think of it though I realize of my issues stemmed from the negative environment around me and my lack of confidence in myself reinforced this negative view of myself. Its more of a matter of a person can accept themselves and admit their flaws before they can grow as a person. Every person is shaped by their environment and because we Hapas are relatively a new group people are not exactly sure how to react to us. Sure its not perfect being Hapa but now as I grow older I see more and more as a positive thing. If you reinforce negative thoughts you are only creating that as your reality. That applies to everyone in every race, and background. Instead of feeling self pity I think many of us Hapas need to look at our positives and embrace it. My main fear is if a person internalizes self hating views like Elliot Rodger than they will become a danger to themselves and others. The whole UCSB shooting served as a wake up call to me that evil exists in every race and background including us Hapas. I no longer have the fantasy view that we Hapas are all nice, well adjusted people who are the ""best of both Worlds"". That is a myth, and its just naive to think that way. However I do not think we are all losers or terrible people either. Like anyone else we have a lot of good qualities, and bad. At the end of the day race is only one aspect of an individual and our society puts too much weight on the concept of race."

Racial classification hasn't ever really come up with a unifying theory on Eurasians. We're pretty much dead in the middle.  I also noticed that the Eurasians from Japanese background look quite white probably bc of Ainu lineage.

Whereas, offspring of white men in general, anywhere on the planet, tend to have more complexes, even on opposite sides of the planet, like in latin america. I suspect it's due to white traits mostly being recessive, so the offspring find it hard to identify with the father, his people and his culture, whereas vice versa, it's much easier to do so, and they have less complexes."

Luckily, i've felt comfortable being able to strongly identify myself as an American, even part of the American Dream, being an actual product of several mixed ethnicity persons. Who knows what life/society will be like in 10-20 years when your hypothetical children will be teenagers dealing with their own hormones and high school drama. I'm sure with parents such as yourselves (having to deal with {presumed} sexual identity issues) you'll be equipped and ready to handle any similar ID issues your kids may feel.

Notice, it's not any other mix that's the problem...this coupling tends to be toxic; not yours.  I second EurasianTiger; get a healthy white lady to surrogate, may be less risk.   More specifically, the researchers found that white mother/Asian father couples had the lowest rate (23 percent) of caesarean delivery, while Asian mother/white father couples had the highest rate (33.2 percent). Because birth weights between these two groups were similar, the researchers say the findings suggest that the average Asian woman's pelvis may be smaller than the average white woman's and less able to accommodate babies of a certain size. (Asian couples had babies with the lowest median birth weight, so caesarean delivery was less common among those women.)   http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/10/asian-white-couples-face-distinct-pregnancy-risks-stanfordpackard-study-finds.html"

On paper it sounds romantic, but it's rife with difficulties. White privilege is legit, to be honest the Hapas that are ""positive"" here, all look white by their own admission. Most of us here are the ones who look more Asian and feel slighted as a result. Some of us even pass as white and feel angry that we're treated differently from how we actually would be, if we looked more Asian.  So keep that in mind. It's one thing to have lofty dreams about a world that is racially equal in all aspects, but then in terms of reality, it's actually quite different.   Also I suggest doing research on the different effects on the child's health base on the ethnicity of the mother vs. father. Most of the people here believe that in general the children are a lot more robust when coming from a white mother thanks to high prenatal-T, larger bone structure, more robust bodies on the white mothers, lack of necessity for C-section delivery, etc. Think Julien Kang / Hideo Mureoka vs. Sean Lennon / Elliot Rodger."

As a Eurasian man, I suffer from the same racism that Asian men suffer. Having seen the videos and pics posted here, I know I'm not unique, as many of those Hapas look even more strongly Asian than me.   A lot of the racism is most evident in the sexual marketplace. The majority of women, both white and Asian, feel quite comfortable in saying they wont date Asian men. And thats just their personal preference and no one can complain. If it were just a few weirdos doing it, maybe it wouldn't be such a big issue. But when its a large scale social trend, the message it sends is that Asian men are not fit to reproduce and exist.   As a Eurasian male I'm discriminated against based on my Asian male features. How am I supposed to relate to my Asian mom when she is part of the same trend? How can she tell me its ok to be an East Asian male, when shes part of the same trend that makes me feel terrible about my self-worth?  There are numerous dating studies that have empirically backed up these claims on what is driving the WMAF to AMWF trend.   I feel that my own Asian mom made me less valued as an Asian male. And yet its her fault I'm a half-Asian male.   This is something ALL WMAF Hapas have in common, no matter how good you say your parents were.

Asian girls who grew up in a western country are very open to having a relationship with a white guy (I'm talking about college age girls since I'm that age).

This is a personal essay, not suited in an academic context, although, realistically, it's better than most writing at the college undergraduate level.  Some examples:    Furthermore compared to other mixed people half White/Asians are less likely to be stopped by police(6% vs 41% for mixed White/Black), and have bad service at restaurants(25% to 57% of mixed White/Black) which further points out to the fact that Eurasians benefit from White entitlement.   White privilege, entitlement would suggest there is something wrong in expecting good treatment. Also, define your terms, give sources for definitions.   This also relates to full Asian people who similarly do not face as many overt signs of racism, but face the stigma of the “model minority” stereotype, and the view of being a “perpetual foreigner” despite the relative high socioeconomic status of Asian Americans in contrast to other minority groups.

I want to keep my culture, I want the white race to survive long enough for future generations to see. How is it a negative thing? Any other race can have pride in themselves but not whites? Would you honestly have as much animosity for an asian person to value their race over whites, as you accuse me of doing?  I don't think whites are superior to asians, they're different, and I want to keep them that way for the most part. Yes, I am dating an asian man but that doesn't mean I'm letting go of my culture.  Whites should be proud of their heritage and nationality like any other group of people. Why is it such a terrible thing for people when they hear about a white person not being a self-loathing apologist?  I love being white and I love my culture, I love that white people exist and I feel the strongest connection to the people I am most similar to. You can cry all you want about how I should feel ashamed but the truth is most people have pride in themselves and their culture. White people shouldn't be shamed into submission.  it's foolish and naive to think that humans are incapable of appreciating two things for their own unique values. ...My own life for example.

I don't agree with your poltics, but if you want a straight honest answer on whether having a White Nationalist mom will affect the Hapa psyche in the same ways as the dad. The answer is no. The lack of WMAF self-esteem follows largely from mating patterns that are the opposite of AMWF.  If you want to look at the racial differences between White and Asian women, just look at the fact that both on the Eurasian blog comments and on r/Hapas, the only mothers who are concerned about these issues, and have empathy and sympathy for their sons are the White mothers. Even though these posts are not addressed to AMWF, it is the AMWF moms who show worry for their sons.   This is a case study in the cultural differences in maternal care, and could be a contributing factor on why white moms are better at raising Hapa sons, than Asian moms are.   If as a self-declared White Nationalist, racial differences are important to you. Then you should look into the biological and cultural differences between the white moms in AMWF and the Asian moms in WMAF."

Having politics revolved around mixing everyone together is just a fanciful wish of egalitarians. People need an identity. Look at Europe with their Muslim population issue. Through all of the work put in to assimilate them, muslims are still a fringe group, completely disregarded European culture.  I am concerned about my children, for hapas born to self-loathing asian mothers and semi-respectable fathers I truly feel bad, but there is nothing I (as a white female) can do to stop it, I'm irrelevant in that sense.

hapas,3cb7ou,mtzo,2,Mon Jul 6 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"But I respect asian culture. I think white/asian culture should be preserved and not simply melded together.   The problem with WMAF couples is that they hate Asian men and Western women, and yet their sons are half-asian men and their daughters are half-white women. Sure some WMAF couples say they are ""only"" racist against Blacks and Muslims, but none of them think much of East Asian men either. The WMAFs who claim to ""respect"" Asian culture, also mock and put down the Asian men who are the primary creators of said culture. When an AMWF White Nationalist says she respects Asian culture, she is voting with her feet, and should be believed.  Just look at the c-section rates, AMWF and WMAFs are not just different from each other they are OPPOSITE of each other. WMAF has the MOST pregnancy complications, and AMWF has the LEAST. they are on opposite poles.    The simplest explanation of why WMAF screws its sons. Is that implicitly or often explicitly it is based on de-valuing East Asian manhood. When you get to the bottom of it- WMAF cockblocks its own sons. AMWF doesn't, AMWF does the opposite.    I will teach my child to respect cultures worthy of respect   You have taught your Half-Asian son he is worthy of respect, by marrying his Asian dad. A WMAF family, no matter how much they celebrate Asian culture, will never be able to tell their Half-Asian son, that Asian men are worthy of respect, because the Asian mom's actions speak louder than her words.   White women are the highest value women, which you as a White Nationalist must recognize. By mating with an East Asian male, you are assigning value to Asian men. While WMAFs do the opposite and take away from the value of Asian men.  By being an AMWF, you increase the value of Asian men, AMWF sons and WMAF sons at the same time."

There is another group other than hapas known for crime - black youth - where lack of strong father figures is a major issue.  What does this have to do with WMAF hapa sons? Well their father may stick around, and even be a good parent, but simply can't provide a role model for a son who looks and feels and is treated Asian. He can never grow up to be his father and he has no one else to look up to. They feel like they are a representative of what their mother hates, what their father stole from, and what few females are interested in dating, and what can never measure up to their father. Why doesn't this sound like a recipe for a serial killer?  AMWF sons are different. They also feel Asian, but have a positive Asian role model to follow, they can take after dad. And their mum gave them the skills to operate in western Society. And they look Latino more than Asian and are usually a hit with the ladies.    Dads matter."

Its only the really heinous Hapa crimes that make the national news, and feature his photo and parents prominently. And every single one of those crimes was driven by social isolation or sexual frustration. Its documented proof that our claims on r/Hapas has a basis in reality.   But again the Hapa maniacs making the national news, are just the tip of the iceberg of all the smaller Eurasian misdemeanors driven by the angst imposed on them by WMAF families. Not one of the major crimes had a rational or economic self-interest involved. Every single Hapa crime was driven by mental breakdowns, Hapas finally snapping from the hellish lives their WMAF parents gave them. How many Hapas out there have quietly committed suicide in despair? Again, since they never harmed others, we would never even know about these poor souls.

He does not look black and anyone meeting him initially would just believe him to be an Asian-American. That being said, he identifies more with the black side of his family.   When I met David he told me he was your typical outcast nerd in school; that he had very few friends in school, etc. And he is, to this day, a bit of an awkward person.   He's also bald now. When I met him he was just going bald in the center of his head. He finally shaved the rest of it off and is rolling with the baldness. It suits him well.   He looks damn good. He goes to the gym 5 times a week. He is very muscular. He finished college with a good degree and has a great job now. He has 2 kids that he dotes on.   When I first met him he seemed to be almost apologetic for being Asian, even mentioning something about having a small penis. Don't do this. Please. Apologizing for your penis size is worse than having a small penis and embracing it. Men with small penis's compensate in other ways. It's ALL good.

You need to shine and succeed in your own specific way. When you are finally content with what you've accomplished, that will be all you. Your family won't get any of the credit, only you do. Since you are the one that had to find your own way.  You're the one that has to live out your life, not them. If anything, they only laugh at you because they know they are wrong deep down. The brutal honest truth is that they are benefiting from white supremacy, even if they don't truly understand it. If you are in a 99% white town, you may need to just accept being the token Asian kid, even if you are half white. BUT you can still be an awesome token.  If it makes you feel any better, I came out with most of the dark Asian features and my sister mostly looks white. She is just small like an Asian. I am kind of tall but skinny. I am strong but my muscles don't get big, they just get more toned. It's because I'm Asian. Asian is NOT a bad thing. Don't let people make you feel that way."

You started your post wanting to show that Asian males, aren't that much worse off than other minority males in the media, and yet by going through the examples, you realize by the end of the post, that Asian males are by far the worst."
hapas,3c5e1x,mtzo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. Indian men probably have it worse. Arguably Middle Eastern men as well. Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian men are stereotyped as nerds who don't get girls. But the stereotype is not as accurate with Asian men because if you go to California where Asians are actually statistically significant, you see that the stereotypes are complete bullshit. There aren't any Indian American ghetto areas in the U.S. like you Asian American ghetto areas from Oakland to Long Beach. And if you go to California, Asian men get more respect out there than anywhere else in America. The stereotypes of Indian and Middle Eastern men are a little more accurate. The thought of an Indian American gang with horrible fobby accents is much more laughable than real Asian thugs from Oakland or Long Beach. What would the Indian gang be called? The 7-11 Mob?"

Asian men are almost exclusively seen as nerds, and even in Gran Torino, it was a white guy who saved the day. So, the asians still come off as relatively beta. If you look at arabs and indians, they also get a huge terrorist stereotype, a lot of the actors who play arabs or terrorists are indians, so arabs/indians can at least play that angle. Even being a terrorist is at least masculine, and some sluts are going to be attracted to that, same way that they are to any other thug groups.

I wonder how many of these children who are considered Asian are actually hapa? I see that there is a section for ""two or more races"", but I think many people just put down one race instead of two. Furthermore I also wonder how many of these single parent Asian families are due to the father passing away (in other words not abandoning his family like whites and blacks are well known to do). My dad died when I was 5 yrs old from cancer. I grew up with my white mom. So am I a ""white family"" or ""asian family""?   I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't see a whole lot of Asian men leaving their families or not getting married to the woman they impregnate. Unlike white and black men, Asian men tend to have better family values."

If half white/half Asian and I'm more masculine than most men by the fact that I'm tall over 6' and I can grow facial hair. I'm also a pretty boy and I have a lot of clothes, shoes and sneakers. I also don't kiss white people's asses or kiss Asian people's asses either. I accept who accepts me. The mixed race men who post in this subreddit tend to be fucked up in the head because they can't deal with the fact that white people will never accept you. By why would you want to be accepted by white people? White people are nothing but a bunch of culture vultures who steal everything ""cool"" from black people and make it corny (i.e. Macklemore, Iggy Azaelia and even that overrated piece of shit Eminem) and their only ""culture"" is Starbucks, McDonald's, Walmart, hot dogs and hamburgers. Oh yeah, and I forgot hardcore drug addiction is also a cornerstone of white culture.   The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence as they say. I was at the bar with a corny white dude who is my friend and we were talking about girls and he said ""I'm just another white guy"" with a sad resignation that he did not stand out at all being a generic average height average looking JC Penny clothes wearing whiteboy.  And everybody has a hard time with dating and sex. The most successful guys who get the most girls usually holler at every single girl they see until one says yes. They might holler at 40 women before one says ""yes"" and gives up her phone number, but even then she might not pick up her phone or respond to your texts, ever. It's a numbers game when it come to women and you have to pick up on context clues like eye contact as well as maintaining a good conversation in a non-creepy way once you introduce yourself. And it takes a high tolerance for rejection to do that. But it should be quality over quantity. If some of you here say that women never look at you like they want to talk to you, I think you're lying."

hapas,3btsi7,pol01234,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:56:53 2015 UTC,"This is true. If you notice something is that one of the most hilariously unsuccessful PUA's of all time is a Middle Eastern guy named Roosh V who desperately wants to be seen as a white man. Roosh V is half Iranian and half Persian but his often gross unkempt appearance of Jesus like hair and facial hair and his creepy deer in the headlights glare make him a world class creepy. Roosh was so unsuccessful with women where he lived in the DC area that his whole PUA movement is about traveling to distant often poor countries to try to score with the local women. Yet, Roosh rarely finds success with women anywhere he goes in the world. Local talkshows in various different countries have made a joke out of Roosh and painted him to be a sex tourist. Roosh can seem to find the problem is himself and he needs to fix that.   Roosh's other problem is that he has internalized all of the racist white supremacist ideologies about sex that he was programmed to believe growing up in very uppity upper middle class Montgomery County where whiteness is prized and blackness and urban culture is ostracized. Roosh even made a list ranking men on sexual desirability where he placed white men on top and predictably placed black and Asian men at the bottom predictably. This is train of thought is so common in America it is not even seen as offensive:  http://www.rooshv.com/totem-pole-of-race-attractiveness  I live in the county bordering Montgomery County and I have spent much time in DC and Montgomery County. The dating scene there does suck and it is highly socially segregated. If Roosh would have ghettoized himself to only hanging out with Middle Eastern folks, that's the only way he could get pussy in the DC area. If you are below average, do not expect to bag top notch girls. Especially not stereotypically attractive white girls as an average to below average Middle Eastern or Asian guy.   The problem I also see here is that many mixed half-white/half Asian males have also internalized the sick racial hierarchy of sexual attractiveness. But being half white does not make you white in America. No matter what, you should be yourself and not give a fuck want anybody else thinks. If you know who you are and do not live your life worrying about what other people will think, you will have more success in every arena of life eventually."

hapas,3bsx8a,EurasianTiger,2,Wed Jul 1 23:00:03 2015 UTC,Lmao unbelievable. White women that are with Asian guys are way braver than even girls that go with black dudes. White dudes are the cockblockers not the other way around
hapas,3bsx8a,ready2run,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is pretty fucked up when white dudes hit on a pregnant woman. My mom is 5'0 and 95 pounds (she topped out around 130 when she was pregnant with me), so it's not like she was one of those chicks that's so fat they don't look preggers. My mom's tummy looked like a balloon that was about to pop.   IMO hitting on obviously pregnant women is cuckoldry on a whole other level!"

And here I'm living as a Half-Asian male in a society that treats me like scum.   Why the rest of world doesn't see this as a problem, and thinks Half-Asian men should be happy with their fate, boggles my mind."
hapas,3bsx8a,ready2run,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"What's really fucked is white dude's that laugh at my mom for dating Asian dudes, yet will drool over me. How the fuck do these guys think I was made?!  My father died when I was 5 and my mom waited till my brother and I were on our own (I was in college and my bro was finishing HS) to start dating. Some guys in her building would make rude comments about the men she was dating, mainly because she wouldn't date them IMO, these same guys all the sudden would turn polite when I came around. Then would tell my mom what they wanted to do to me when I wasn't around. Nasty Fuckin pervs."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm ""low inhibition thug Asian"" and I can confirm that violence is the only language that the white man understands. I used to be peaceful but I've been robbed and jumped multiple times by black, natives and white people. Nowadays people look at me and they don't want to fuck with me, especially if they know who I am already.  I used to respect Asians for being smart and peaceful but now that I'm older, I look down on most Asians for being too passive. Especially if they know that other people take advantage of their kindness. Shit will never happen to me again."
hapas,3bsx8a,EurasianTiger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:23:52 2015 UTC,My only consolation is that these white thugs are going to be victimized by black thugs for the rest of the lifespan of the US.  White people deserve black people. They're made for each other.

hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:07:40 2015 UTC,If ethnics slay why are their rape levels so high?   Slayers don't need to rape. There are places in Europe where 100 percent of rapes are committed by non whites. 100 percent. Oslo Norway being a good example.
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,2,Thu Jul 2 03:01:33 2015 UTC,"Studies show that white men, especially white college fraternities rape women the time. The difference is that they rape family members or close friends. So basically incest and date rape. They are also far less likely to be arrested if they are wealthy and white. The white girls are just less likely to call the police on the people they know. You can't honestly believe that drunk ass white men don't ever rape women in Europe.   There are also thousands of white men that go to SE Asia and other third world countries just to have sex with small children. I consider all of them rapists."
hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:19:19 2015 UTC,A Swedish woman was raped by a Somalian man. She died during it and he kept raping her. He raped her corpse. This was a few months ago.   Please don't try to compare some frat douches taking advantage of some sorority sluts to the Muslim rape epidemic in Europe.
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,2,Thu Jul 2 03:29:07 2015 UTC,A Swedish woman was raped by a Somalian man. She died during it and he kept raping her. He raped her corpse.    You typed this as if it happens everyday. How often are Somalians raping dead bodies in Sweden? You typed this story for an emotional shock response.   It's sad but I bet a dirty white uncle in the U.S. is molesting his niece somewhere right now. That girl is going to grow up and date black and brown guys.
hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,2,Thu Jul 2 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for admitting that ethnic guys only get damaged goods white females lol.   Look up Rotherham grooming scandal. The UK government covered this shit up because of fear of a race war if the native Brits got the details. They actually aided and abetted Pakistanis using young British schoolgirls as sex slaves. The government sold out the white citizens of the UK in favor of Pakistani immigrant rapists. Gotta love dat white privilege. Don't even get me started on how European governments are evicting native populations from their homes to make room for asylum seekers. This is why I just can't take SJWs seriously. they are so off base with their rhetoric it's laughable. If anybody has privilege it's the non white immigrants.   Are all ethnic men rapists? No. Will they all make excuses and refuse to condemn the criminal elements in their respective race? Yes, or at least a large majority. This is the main problem I have with most of them. White people will condemn racism or ""Islamophobia"" until the cows come home. They will apologize for perceived crimes that they had nothing to do with. No other race apologizes for anything or cleans out the skeletons in their closets."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,6,Thu Jul 2 04:23:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for admitting that ethnic guys only get damaged goods white females lol.   I never even said this. You really like to type a bunch of random shit as if we are arguing about things. I'm not.  Are all white men rapists? No. Will they all make excuses and refuse to condemn the criminal elements in their respective race? Yes, or at least a large majority. This is the main problem I have with most of them. They will apologize for their crimes and then they think it's all over. No other race has the power to apologize for everything, while still reaping the benefits of having military bases on every single continent and controlling most of the worlds economy. It's OK, I understand that you are having a hard time dealing white dominance losing it's influence all over the world. Now you have to see more brown guys having consensual relations with white women. This must be the reason you waste your time typing to half Asians on Reddit."
hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:30:49 2015 UTC,"Again you are resorting to the ""derp da brown man stealin ur wimminz XD"" argument. It's so typical of non whites to be juvenile like this.   Lol @ talking about military bases and economies. The US is not a ""white country"" and hasn't been one for some time. You can't use America's dominance as an indictment on the white race. So brown people are taking over America yet everything America does still gets placed on the shoulders of the soon to be white minority?  Seems reasonable. The American military is 20 percent non white and it has been that way since Vietnam.   And you and I both know who REALLY controls the world economies."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"""derp da brown man stealin ur wimminz XD""   You are trying too hard. I never typed this. What is said is ""Now you have to see more brown guys having consensual relations with white women. This must be the reason you waste your time typing to half Asians on Reddit"".  Can you honestly tell me this isn't true?   You keep proving me right."
hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:58:27 2015 UTC,I know what you said and it's juvenile. But it is exactly what I would expect from a non white.   I could easily say a million hurtful things about your situation and why you post here that I guarantee would hit way closer to home for you than what you said does for me. But I take the high road.
hapas,3bsx8a,SmithingtonBaxter,0,Fri Jul 3 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"Also you never addressed my point.   How, in the face of things like Rotherham, could you possible rationalize the idea that white supremacy/privilege is a real thing?   Furthermore do you really expect whites to not have privilege in their own countries? You wouldn't have a problem with Asian people having privilege in their own countries. Yet for some reason whites are expected to be doormats for immigrant invaders."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"Dude, you really are a clown. I can't even tell if you're joking.   Do you even live in the U.S.? Do you live in a cave? The suburbs and gated communities are majority white and sometimes East Asian. Ghettos are usually black, Hispanic and sometimes poor white areas. Even liberal cities have a white ruling class. They hire illegal Mexicans to do their manual work. This causes right-wing working class white people to hate immigrants. White people are really the ones fighting each other (Republicans and Democrats). This country could fall apart like Rome, and it's not just because of black and brown people. Having to live with and get along with immigrants doesn't mean that you have to be a pussy or a doormat for them. I don't even care if it comes down to separatism but if it does, it will be because of lame people like you that can't see the big picture."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,2,Fri Jul 3 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"This is called a straw-man argument. One fucked up Somalian man in Sweden does not represent all ethnic men. Even if there are large rape gangs in Europe, they still don't represent ethnic men. There are billions of ""ethnic"" men that don't rape women. You must be a white guy because this should be obvious to most people. You sound like a very simple person."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,-1,Thu Jul 2 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"Could you imagine an average asian guy with an ER frame pulling that off though? It's impossible, they'd just be tossed aside if they tried to pull that. At least arabs/latinos/pakis, etc. have the Frame to pull it off to be intimidating to whites and other races. But Asians would just be laughed at and people would call their bluff and they'd get beaten up. The only legit asians who can be somewhat respected physically are altaic types like mongols/turkics, but typical east asians? No way."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a skinny half Asian man and I've literally beaten redneck white boys until their faces were completely swollen. I've also boxed black dudes that were slightly bigger than me. It's not about size at all. Majority white men are out of shape and drink/smoke far too much, they also only think they can fight because of TV. Asians are much faster and agile.   You don't give Asian DNA enough credit and you overestimate the white man. Sounds like you bought into their propaganda."
hapas,3bsx8a,EverettEvergreen,-1,Thu Jul 2 02:14:30 2015 UTC,"Well, there are statistical outliers, I'm just saying that appearance has a major social impact, a nervous shy guy with mental issues who looks like a Chad, is not going to be as picked on as much as a guy who looks like a dork, and east asians probably have the highest percentage of Dorks to Chads vs. any other race. Even if it is proven otherwise, it doesn't change the initial first glance assumptions, so all the issues are still there."
hapas,3bsx8a,EurasianTiger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:23:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously dude, their stereotypes for Asian men only exist because white elites are scared of the Asian elites. It's a war that is much bigger than individuals. Vietnamese defeated the U.S. with far less technology and equipment. The reality is that ""little Asian men"" are the only real organized threat to white power. No other race has been able to compete with white dominance like Asia has, this is why they call us ""model minorities"". They want to keep their enemies close and docile like a little pet."
hapas,3bsx8a,TranceFan95,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"mtzo was talking about this subject before: "" The US has been in Iraq and Afghanistan, dirt poor countries for decades, and yet the war marriages are in the single digits. Nothing like Japan, Korea, Vietnam. So I strongly disagree with you saying this is a woman issue and not an East Asian woman issue. Sure there are prostitutes of every race, but East Asian women seem to have a unique inclination towards it, regardless of income."""
hapas,3bsx8a,sardinemanR,2,Thu Jul 2 10:48:19 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah, I agree that East Asian women are a special case when it comes to marrying after the war and being overall prostitutes for the west. You still can't really compare it to Muslim countries though.    I see it all the time. They are brainwashed. I just hope they wake up or else they are going to have many unhappy children."
