badpolitics,3dvoi4,narrenburg,5,Sun Jul 19 22:33:51 2015 UTC,This channel is really a goldmine for bad politics.
badpolitics,3dvoi4,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,3,Sun Jul 19 23:27:37 2015 UTC,I feel like this is relevant.
badpolitics,3dvoi4,Waz_Met_Jou,12,Mon Jul 20 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"K, so first off, RockingMrE claims that libertarianism was first coined in the 18th century to formalise a indeterminist/free-will position contrasted by determinism. This is true; William Belsham was the first to use it.However, this does not reflect a political libertarianism, but a metaphysical one, so that is an equivocation. His linked assertions that leftists co-opted the word, which he bases this on, is untrue (I'll get to that later).  Second, RockingMrE claims leftists generally uphold the collective will over sovereignty, and that our derision of private property reflects this. However, this ignores the long tradition of anti-capitalists individualists (notably Tucker, Spooner and Stirner). Furthermore, our opposition to private property comes not from a fundamental belief in collectivism, but the exploitative relation between the property, the proprieter and the rest of society we perceive. In fact, socialists generally believe the individual will flourish as their material and social needs will be better met (see The Soul of Man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde).  Then, he illustrates a political spectrum that only contains socialism. Nothing else. I don't think I need to go much further on that one.  RockingMrE continues by claiming that liberalism originally meant classical liberalism (true), and that leftists co-opted the word to hide their socialist tendencies from votes (not true). Social liberalism developed precisely for the opposite reason, to quell and weaken actual left-wing movements with attractive reform within the same political form. In the United States, control of Southern states and the black voter demographic also impacted its development of social liberalism. Moreover, AFAIK, on the Continent, liberalism still has its classical connotations.  Lastly, and worst of all, he shows his ignorance by jumping from the eighteenth century, to the middle of the twentieth century, in which right-wingers try to use libertarianism, with predictable left-wing backlash. Over 100 years and nothing to show from the right wing! And the backlash was indeed predictable; after all,   Joseph Dejacque (an anarcho-communist) coined the term in its political sense in a letter to mutualist Proudhon, Anarchists published the paper Le Libertaire in reaction to France banning the word ""anarchist"", The Spainsh revolutionaries in the Civil War referred to themselves as libertarian, An entire branch of Marxism called libertarian Marxism arose in reaction to Marxism-Leninism in practice, and One of the largest anarchist websites is called Libcom.org, short for libertarian communism."
badpolitics,3dvoi4,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,5,Sun Jul 19 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Social liberalism arose to quell left-wing movements? I'm pretty sure that wasn't its intention, regardless of what actually happened."
badpolitics,3dvoi4,satanisativa,3,Sun Jul 19 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was created organically out of that, but I think moderation was a tactic against revolution, which was pretty popular in the 19th and 20th centuries. While it may not have been a conscious use of moderation to quell radical change that threatens the status quo, the end result is the same. If I can be US_centric for a second, that idea has worked pretty well. Early in the 20th century, radical socialist politics were surprisingly popular in the US amongst farmers and working-class people (to this day, the Minnesota Democrats are the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party). I think that, over time, the contemporary liberal idea of ""nicer capitalism"" quelled the most militant movement by creating a welfare state, regulating the banks, creating subsidies for farmers, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, etc. Most worker's lot in life improved compared to what is was before, and so the urgency of revolution and militant organizing were subdued.  You're likely right that ""nice capitalism"" liberalism wasn't used specifically to make impotent radicals and revolutionaries in the US, but the effect seems to have been the same. You can almost trace the decline of union membership and anticapitalist sentiment along with the rise of the welfare state and regulations on large capital."

badpolitics,3dd7me,inkosana,18,Wed Jul 15 10:22:10 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, this is  the fault of the editor, for the dumb title and the dumber tagline:   The plot to marginalize Bernie Sanders: The shared agenda that links Fox News and Hillary Clinton surrogates  Both parties are owned by plutocrats. Sanders' challenge threatens them both, and their responses are oddly similar   The article begins by rebuking Senator Claire McCaskill for her recent attack on Senator Sanders in the media, in which she claimed that Clinton would be a better nominee because she could ""carry the torch of middle class opportunity without alienating a wide swath of voters by being, frankly, a socialist"".  After stumbling around a working definition of the term ""socialist"" for a few paragraphs, the author pauses for a moment to criticize Fox News for using ""socialism"" as a derogatory term, then begins talking about how corporations write the laws, man, and concludes with two paragraphs explaining that Sanders' platform isn't even that crazy.  After reading it, I don't hate the article, but the article/tagline are seriously cringeworthy. The content of the article doesn't provide much support for the allegations in the title, and the conclusion is a separate point entirely. But, from what support the author did give, you'll notice that McCaskill, a democrat, objected to Sanders on the grounds that he may alienate voters by being too left, whereas Fox News objected to Sanders on the grounds that his ideology is fundamentally awful.  Maybe Senator McCaskill and Fox News aren't actually shilling for the same plutocrats, maybe they each have interest in people that aren't Sanders winning the election. If establishment Democrats don't want a rift within their party between the Progressives and the Third Way Democrats and they want to get everyone behind one strong candidate, and conservative pundits are saying that anyone left of center is fundamentally awful, then that's not really the same agenda, is it?  TL/DR: There's perfectly reasonable explanations for why Sanders may be meeting resistance from within the party which he only just began to claim as his own in his bid for the presidency beyond ""DAE Democrats and Republicans are actually all just shilling for the same plutocrats?"""

The easiest way for me to explain it to people is that Libertarian Socialism is a thing. That also helps get into the Libertarian problem as well, that we're all familiar with here."
badpolitics,3c91wk,friendly-dropbear,10,Mon Jul 6 03:57:24 2015 UTC,Could you please explain to me what Libertarian Socialism is? I'm kinda new to Socialism.
badpolitics,3c91wk,deathpigeonx,14,Mon Jul 6 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, dude. Libertarian Socialism is something of an umbrella term for strains of socialism that reject state command and hierarchy in general, this includes hierarchies within the workplace and wage labor. This can be juxtaposed with, say, Marxism-Leninism which emphasizes the use of the state and advances the goals of the proletariat via a vanguard party.  The easiest way to think about it is literally; Libertarianism (outside the American usage) is focused on limited state and abolishing hierarchy, Socialism is worker control over the means of production. Ya just combine the two and there it is."
badpolitics,3c91wk,komnene,3,Mon Jul 6 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"limited state   Limited at most. If I remember right, the first person to ever self-identify as a libertarian was a French anarcho-communist."
badpolitics,3c91wk,Waz_Met_Jou,4,Mon Jul 6 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Just so. Depending on the strain, Libertarian ranges from a very limited state to outright anarchist. As always, there's a range of views that will fit under a doctrine."
badpolitics,3c91wk,absinthe718,3,Mon Jul 6 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"It was Joseph Déjacque who said that Proudhon was ""Moderate anarchist, liberal, but not libertarian"" because Proudhon was a sexist.  Also, no state is a sort of limited state, technically."
badpolitics,3c91wk,Wxnzxn,38,Fri Jul 10 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"R5: Most of us would regard the term ""liberal socialist"" to be at least something of an oxymoron. In any sort of technical sense, the two are incompatible with one another; one being capitalist and the other being, well, socialist. It's a misunderstanding that we've seen time and time again that become evident in his later remarks:   But I will be the first to say that a socalism system does not work if you don't actually collect the taxes you need to fund the state.   And of course this comment has 110 upvotes despite it not being completely clear what he means with other users agreeing with him that they hold ""liberal socialist"" views. It just goes to show how little so many people understand about terms that have become nothing but buzzwords to categorize people into colloquial groups, rather than overarching ideologies.  His misunderstanding is made completely evident by this comment:   I would guess something similar to social democrat, elements of socialism but not full blown state socialism.   It's clear that he's using USSR-brand Socialism™ combined with a welfare state to make up his understanding of actual socialism. I don't think he knows about the whole worker control over the means of production thing."

badpolitics,3c91wk,StWd,4,Mon Jul 6 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"Social liberalism:       Social liberalism is a political ideology that seeks to find a balance between individual liberty and social justice. Like classical liberalism, social liberalism endorses a market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights and liberties, but differs in that it believes the legitimate role of the government includes addressing economic and social issues such as poverty, health care and education.    Under social liberalism, the good of the community is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual.  Social liberal policies have been widely adopted in much of the capitalist world, particularly following World War II.  Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left.      The term social liberalism is used to differentiate it from classical liberalism, which dominated political and economic thought for several centuries until social liberalism branched off from it around the Great Depression.

badpolitics,3c91wk,tossup02,12,Mon Jul 6 09:08:29 2015 UTC,"Socialism doesn't necessarily have to take a Marxist view of social relations, even if most modern strains at least nominally do."
badpolitics,3c91wk,FriendlyCommie,19,Mon Jul 6 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"True, but I'd say that social ownership and cooperative management are pretty central to most strains, even throughout the history of socialism. Liberalism (classical included) is usually antithetical with this, except in the limited case of democratic socialism replacing a liberal/neo-liberal system.  As always, the truth is complicated and often not very truth-y."
