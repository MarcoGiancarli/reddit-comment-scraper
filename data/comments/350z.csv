350z,3e3qpk,MrDiew,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:59 2015 UTC,What is it doing exactly?  Sounds sick isn't exactly a description. When was the clutch done? How does the pedal feel? What sound is it making?  If it's making sounds...  What speed? How often? Etc etc.
350z,3e3qpk,tobythesandwich,2,Tue Jul 21 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"To follow up, does the sound go away with the clutch pedal depressed? Is the sound affected by RPM, or road speed?"
350z,3e3qpk,TheZeven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:04:37 2015 UTC,The sound does go away when the clutch is fully depressed. Sound is only present when idling/stop sign/redlight.  Thanks all!
350z,3e3qpk,TheZeven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:38 2015 UTC,Could be a noisy throw-out bearing. Replacing the clutch would resolve that.
350z,3e3qpk,bmueller91,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:13 2015 UTC,You don't need to replace the clutch to replace the throw-out bearing
350z,3e3qpk,TheZeven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"No kidding. But based on the OP, I presumed it may be necessary regardless.   Also, to suit my own laziness, I have a rule that if I pull the transmission, and it's been some years since I changed a clutch, regardless of ""apparent"" need (or not), I'm going to spend the money and replace the clutch, just so I don't have to pull the transmission again.  So, while I agree with what you say... If it were me, I'd still replace the whole thing."
350z,3e3qpk,Jaing008,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Here is a video I found on youtube. This is what it sounds like exactly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dkhmwUyamg  Sometimes the sound is there, sometime it isn't. Usually hear it when idling or sitting a red or stop sign. When I am in motion, everything sounds fine (no abnormal noise). I did this with no audio.  My brother brought it in 2008/2009. Driven it since then. To date, he has not changed the clutch yet. I started driving the Z sparely since January of this year. This Z is my first stick and only 1 I learned on (all in total stalled about 20-30 times).   The clutch is stiff (don't know if its normal for Z's).   When I drive 1st gear, the car sputters front and back once when I just take my foot off the gas pedal extremely quickly. It doesn't happen if I ease off the gas pedal   2nd gear, entry is smooth.  3rd gear, when I go from 2nd to 3rd in a rush, there is a grinding issue. To counter that, I sit in neutral for a small moment (while the clutch is fully depressed) then I shift up to third.  4th gear, is fine along with 5th and 6th."
350z,3e2lbg,shrewmz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"I recommend a swap. Perhaps it's time to upgrade to the HR, or perhaps squeeze a Nissan Titan v8 in there, as some people have... In California, if you were to do that, I believe their only rule is that it has to be an engine of the same year or newer, for emissions."
350z,3e2lbg,mredding,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"Its my understanding that putting an HR into a DE is kind of a pain in the ass (electronically if I am remembering correctly).

350z,3e2lbg,TrollHouseCookie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"Correct, as I understand it the ECU in the HR has tighter integration with the ABS and BCM computers. In the DE the three barely talk, but the HR uses a full can bus system so they can all exchange much more info. That may extend to the IPDM as well. Salvaged ABS, BCM, and IPDM units are available for $125-250, but I don't know what those in turn would require (different harnesses certainly, but do they talk to new sensors and harnesses that the DE body doesn't have?)."

350z,3e2hrv,Tracheal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:40 2015 UTC,"Do you know if it is the Pro Kit (~1in drop) or the Sportlines (>1in drop)?  Either way, best practice is to get new shocks/struts that can adequately deal with the drop in ride height. I have heard good things about Koni, Bilstein, and Tokico D-Spec's.   Once you get the springs and shocks installed I would drive around for a week or two to let everything settle in. Then, go in for an alignment and see how out of spec you are. Each car may be a little different so depending on where your alignment is and what your goals are you will need additional parts to correct the alignment.   Most people can get away without a camber kit in the front. But again that depends how much the car is lowered. The lower it is the more likely you will need a camber kit. The rear I can almost assure you will need a camber kit to get back writhin OEM specs.   Best of luck!"
350z,3e2hrv,Zrepsilon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"Sportlines will definately require a front and rear camber kit.  Budget about 400 for the lower cost options of these. You will also need shocks. Budget ones are about 600$, good ones go for 1000+. Should be able to do it for 1250 including an alignment.   You can MAYBE get by with stock suspension and just more adjustable eccentric washers with the PRO-Kit.  So if its the PRO-Kit it should run in the ballpark of 950$"

350z,3e2hrv,unthused,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"I lowered mine (2006) with Tein S-Tech springs (~.75"" drop).  I was able to get the front aligned without any new parts, but needed to adjust the rear more to get in spec, so I went with the SPC rear camber / toe bolt. I'm still running the OEM shocks with no issues.  I plan to replace them soon with something adjustable, but they're performing just fine for now."

The OE tires are summer sports tires rated for light rain. There is nothing inherently wrong with the car's suspension or design that makes it bad in snow and ice, it's just a problem with the tires. Otherwise, it drives just fine. I know your winters well...   What are some problems that seem to occur more often with this car?   Up by you, your slave cylinder will freeze and your clutch pedal will stick to the floor.   How many miles does this car typically last before I need to start replacing parts;   I've got 81k miles and I'm still running strong without having to replace parts I haven't broken myself (sway bar connectors after I installed aftermarket, cracked rims due to club racing).   how is changing the spark plugs and regular things that are changed more often?   I still have trouble locating air filters without having to go to the dealer. But that shouldn't be the case for you. The oil filter access is a bit tight and I can't remove it without making a mess. Haven't done spark plugs yet. Brakes are straight forward.   Are there any other concerns about the 350Z that should be addressed?   The 07 was a good year. Earlier models had problems the other owners can tell you about. I'm just not knowledgeable enough to comment on them."
350z,3dyq64,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"The plugs took me about 90 minutes. Well, 90 minutes plus a run to the store to buy a plug wrench with a magnetic retainer (instead of the friction based ring) and a locking extension. After that the other 5 were simple enough.  Fluids, belts, brakes are all simple enough to do without much hassle."
350z,3dwyae,Wiz_Kid31,4,Mon Jul 20 05:38:47 2015 UTC,I haven't diven mine in the rain since 2009. mine is a base model which didn't come with a LSD or traction control. It was very twitchy in the rain and the rear end would let go pretty dramatically. It behaves much better now that it has an upgraded diff but I still don't trust it.
350z,3dwyae,nathanwl2004,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:43:12 2015 UTC,Can confirm.  I have an 08 base model with no TCS or LSD. Even with good tread depth on the rear tires you really have to respect the throttle. It really requires you to keep your wits about you especially on freeway on ramps that curve.
350z,3dwyae,Zrepsilon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"I drive mine year round in the UK, the weather's not terrible here but it rains often enough and we get icy conditions for maybe a few weeks a year and snow for maybe a week on average.  I've never really had an issue with it not handling the conditions - it's absolutely fine in the rain if you keep your sensible hat on,  although the back will step out on you whenever you tell it to, meaning you'll need to be sensible with the throttle until you're used to it.   When it's icy/snowy it's pretty rubbish, but I live in a little village on the top of a hill - unless you've got 4wd every car is rubbish, and for me the 350 isn't any worse than any of the other cars I've had, you just need to crawl along until you find a treated road.  Then, when it's summer again, it's a way better car than anything else I've owned..."

With snow, you just have to know how to pick you're battles. Anything more than 4 inches and your bumper becomes a snow shovel so don't even try. Anything less than 4 inches is fine as long as you always pick a flat route to your destination and are familiar with how rear wheel drive vehicles work. Drifting in the snow is easier than turning in the snow so you just have to know when to turn and when to drift. For instance if I need to turn left, I can either turn the wheels left and ease onto the throttle and creep forward, OR you can turn the wheels left and gas it harder to get the rear end to swing around and counter steer in the direction you want to go. For me, it's a blast to drive in the snow! I'm confident in my abilities, it's the other drivers I worry about. I guess the question is, are you a me, or are you the other guys?"

The OE tires are rated for light rain, but honestly I wouldn't drive the car until the standing water has had time to drain. I've 180'd the car turning through intersections just because the ground was wet. You can do it, you just have to be cautious.  I've driven mine through harsh winters. It is mandatory you get tires specifically designed and rated for snow and ice. You absolutely cannot drive this car in these adverse conditions without them. My first year owning the car I drove through the winter on the OE tires. I brought a shovel and a broom, because flurries were enough to trap the car at stop signs (I'd have to get out and sweep to get enough traction to get moving). I've slid off my driveway because I couldn't stop moving in reverse, even when I was powering forward. I've spun the car like a top across 5 lanes of interstate highway in rush hour traffic. I've been stuck in parking spots because the tires spun on compacted snow. I bought a pair of winter tires, hadn't had a problem since."
350z,3dwyae,ItsGnar,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:34 2015 UTC,Trying to figure out how you 180d going through an intersection.... The Z will let the back end out but only if you want it to.
350z,3dwyae,mredding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"The Z will let the back end out but only if you want it to.   Sure. I certainly wouldn't call the car unstable by any stretch of the  imagination, but if the road conditions aren't favorable, it doesn't matter what you're driving.   Trying to figure out how you 180d going through an intersection.   I should clarify I had to turn left through that intersection.  I think it is in part due to that particular intersection. Perhaps something to do with the road pitch or that there may be a lot of oil spill on it or something (it's a busy intersection in a major city). I've 180'd in it several times, even on dry days. What's crazy is it's paved and there's nothing noteworthy about it. I wasn't intentionally doing anything dumb, either, I was just going home from work."

I have the ES2s 9.5/10.5 +22 and added 10mm spacers which make my offset +12. Tire size is 245/275. I would recommend going 255/285, maybe even 295. I'm lowered an inch and a half and the car sits nice with the 19"" rims. You will definitely need to roll your fenders.   As far as tire wear, the only thing you should worry about are your camber and toe specs. If you plan on lowering more than an inch, I recommend you get a rear camber kit. The stock adjustment doesn't have much play to get you at a good camber degree. I'll upload some pics of my car in a while so you can see my setup.   Edit: Here it is."

Common problem on the 03/04 Zs, oil leaks through into the recess and the spark plug burns it. If there is oil, you'll need to replace the valve covers because the gasket for the recess isn't replaceable on its own.   Depending on the number of cylinders it's happening on, it could go a couple thousand miles before causing a noticeable drop in oil pressure, or it could cause a noticeable drop in as few as like, 750 miles."

You'll probably net around 4-8hp max with any exhaust you can think of.  Even if you went full intake, headers, and exhaust you'd only be looking at 15-20hp gains, maybe double with a tune. It really comes down to how you want it to sound and the extra few hp is just a bonus."

350z,3dch8g,ItsGnar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:09:52 2015 UTC,Sometimes a system in which is specifically made for your car is more beneficial as the engineering of it can create back pressure etc. Better off buying a good quality cat back and high flow cats imo.

I recommend saving your money on the exhaust, go get the Pop Charge intake, Motordyne plenum spacer, and the Osiris UpRev tuner. You'll get more power and some decent engine noise from it. Then, if you still want more, go get the Motordyne ART pipes and retune.    THEN, if you still want to go further, get an exhaust. I wouldn't even bother with headers until this point either.    If you just want sound, with a little butt dyno ego boost, get an exhaust. Just keep in mind, all you'll be doing is making noise and blowing hot air."

350z,3dch8g,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"You can get the standard one, which comes loaded with generic (but, still specific to your car) tunes. The tuner is much more versatile but, not really necessary unless you plan on building and/or boosting your car.    Osiris is the cheapest route for tuning. If you don't get that, the tuner you take your car to will buy it, or some other expensive EMS, and charge you out the ass.    If you just want to mod/tune for daily driving and weekend fun, I would recommend the standard Osiris. Then buy your bolt on mods later. Once you have all the mods you want, send the Osiris back in for some updated tunes."
350z,3dch8g,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"How do you send it back? Isn't it software that you download on your laptop and connect to your ECU via OBD? Also I already have a K&N drop in filter, would a pop charger really make a difference in any way?"
350z,3dch8g,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot they offer etunes now, so you may not need to send it back for new tunes. The tuner flashes the tune to your ECU, so its only plugged in for the time you are flashing the new tune. After you are done flashing, you unplug. There really is no benefit to even having a modified intake, even with full bolt ons and a tune. Changing to a pop charger is more for just sound than anything. You'll be surprised at the increase in interior growl you get. But, you wont feel an increase in power. In short, the drop in filter is perfectly fine unless you want to increase engine noise."

350z,3d8524,scorpionMaster,3,Tue Jul 14 13:12:05 2015 UTC,I'm pretty positive rpf1s are forged. I looked at them and might go with them but I would like to go cheaper if I can.
350z,3d8524,scorpionMaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:20:29 2015 UTC,They're flow-formed. Rather light and way less expensive than forged.
350z,3d8524,ntran2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"They are not forged. They're cast. Enkei use a method called MAT Technology for their casting.   Here is the explanation straight from their website:   MAT Technology: Enkei developed a new manufacturing process to produce the next aluminum wheel generation. The Most Advanced Technology (M.A.T) combines one-piece cast wheel technology with a rim forming technology called spinning process. Using this new technology of casting and rim forming by M.A.T process, is critical to improve drastically the material property and strength of the wheels. Rim-Rolled technology shapes the rim to improve material elongation without sacrificing the wheels hardness."
350z,3d8524,ntran2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:35 2015 UTC,So they are cast wheels except they are as durable as forged basically?
350z,3d8524,NikoNub,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"They can still shatter like cast wheels do but they are stronger than majority of cast wheels out there due to this process. It would take more pressure than the average cast wheels, but a forge wheel would still bend and not break."
350z,3d8524,NikoNub,2,Tue Jul 14 18:03:06 2015 UTC,I thought rpf1s were forged. I will look into them now but even then I'm gonna be looking at 2 grand

They're pretty affordable compared to other rims. I've tracked it on my TSW's and my Volks and the TSW's are easily comparable to my wayyy more expensive Volks.
350z,3d7ivj,jcowl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:09:16 2015 UTC,Is there a such thing as a good wheel below $100?
350z,3d7ivj,the_ginga_ninja,2,Tue Jul 14 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"You can try hitting up forums and Craigslist and stuff. I was able to score a grip royal wheel, NRG short hub, and NRG quick release, all brand new, for 200 locally. Guy was hurting for the cash and had very little interest in the setup.  If you have cruise control and want to keep it, you will need to relocate it somewhere. Also, don't forget to grab the resistor so you don't get an airbag light all the time. Or, some electrical tape over the light if you wanna be extra cheap.  If you're cool with painted fiberglass or wood wheels, there was a dude on zilvia who used to sell them for around 100 shipped."

I am pretty sure it's water from the rain because once I park my car back in the garage, it will dry out and if I continue to park in my garage, it will remain dry. The fluid that I soak up is clear and is not stinky, so I am assuming it's rain water.  My door, window area, and the floor area along the door is always dry, it's always the very back floor area behind the passenger seat that is wet.

350z,3d4z80,DickTugnutz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"This doesn't necessarily pertain to your question, but in regards to the scuffed up lip, you can look into plastidip. I know that it is a pretty cheap method in terms of both quality and price, but honestly if you don't like it, just peel it off. You're out maybe an hour and a half of your time and $10, not a big deal.  I got my Z with the lip already plastidipped because it's a little scuffed up as well and I personally prefer the lip being black instead of the same color as the rest of the car. Pic of the front of my Z for reference  As for the mechanical state of the car, try to do a high rpm pull. If the clutch sticks in a depressed position and stays there requiring you to pull it out with your foot, it's most likely the centric clutch slave cylinder as they were made plastic on the 07-08 and are prone to breaking.  Also, I believe the rear diff bushings are a problem, although I don't personally know how to check to see if they are worn. Ball joints are also problematic for some, and again I wouldn't know how to go about checking their condition.  From my experiences, I've owned my Z for about 5,000 miles (not many, I know) and haven't had to do a single thing to it mechanically. Changed the oil and fluids, but those were more preventative maintenance than needed maintenance. It's a wonderful car and I hope everything works out for you OP!"
350z,3d4z80,Getsmkedouthere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"The plastidip would actually be great, but because it's a Nismo, the entire front bumper is quite different than a regular Z's. The ground FX all around the car are dark grey, as opposed to the black main color. I'm not too worried about it though, as i'll probably just take it to a body shop and have the front bumper repainted. I'll already be pulling some of the interior apart to repaint it, so it'll be getting a bit of a makeover as it is.  I will certainly have to try the high rpm pull, though. Id hope with only 87k miles, there wouldn't be much wrong with it at all, mechanically, but you never know."
350z,3d4z80,Getsmkedouthere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"And to think I was just explaining all the differences of the nismo to the other trim of the Z to someone the same day I posted that haha. I completely forgot about the different front fascia so I guess just do what you see necessary.  As for mechanical issues, these cars are incredibly reliable in terms of a sports car and should go to 150+ with ease if you keep up on maintenance and replace the slave and bushings with aftermarket (which is usually cheaper than the OEM parts that break easily).  Although 87 is still pretty low in mileage, the slave cylinder has been known to go as early as 15-20000 if you're particularly unlucky. I think the average is anywhere from 40-60000, but this is purely on a hazy memory of reading a forum a year or two ago so I can't be too sure on that. Chances are, if it has 87000 miles, the slave has probably been replaced. If there are service records, definitely check them out to see if it was done."

350z,3cxzn8,crazyloof,3,Sat Jul 11 23:09:35 2015 UTC,You can definitely find those. Almost a year ago I got a bone stock super clean 07 that had been weekend driven by an old man. Had 62k on it. I bought that for 15k and that was from a dealer so I had to overpay. You could find one if you looked.
350z,3cxzn8,u3h,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:45:42 2015 UTC,"Same. Got an 05 touring with all the options bone stock and looks brand new with 62k on it for 15k. Old man, weekend driven. He had just traded it in and the dealership didn't even have a price on it yet. I got an independent PPI and made them eat the tax tag and title. $14, 400 out the door. Nobody believes me when I tell them it's a ten year old car. They're out there."
350z,3cxzn8,BlueXTC,0,Sun Jul 12 07:38:25 2015 UTC,"130k? No thanks. Sure it's a Nissan and it's reliable but that's just too much to buy for any car unless you want to be replacing this and that in the future, maybe not major things but it will still be a bit annoying. I would start by not looking at anything higher than 80k personally. Doesn't matter how well you maintain, when you start getting that high in miles simple things start to go."

350z,3corpg,mclarenf1GTR,5,Thu Jul 9 16:34:39 2015 UTC,If you notice your brake fluid / clutch levels getting low then keep ontop of it mine died on my road trip and I had to get it overnighted to the dealership in the town I was in from Zspeed.

350z,3corpg,Raptor5150,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:09 2015 UTC,The upgrade is more about reliability than anything else so it's well worth it. Don't all of the DE's have a normal slave cylinder not a concentric one?
350z,3corpg,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:09:57 2015 UTC,We're rallying with stock clutch package. Still working fine after three years and over 25 rallies. All we need to do is clean the secondary cylinder and relubricate the outside after driving quite a distance at high speed and extremely high temperatures. (Interval is shorter when one of the mechanics put just a tad too much on during the last maintenance!) Usually regular flushing will do though.
350z,3corpg,Rowel81,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:52:42 2015 UTC,Hey there! I have made the Zspeed upgrade in my current HR. If you do some looking around online about the OEM slaves you'll notice alot of talk about them failing. Unless you don't mind replacing the slave again I'd just grab the combo.
350z,3corpg,Sampson209,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:44 2015 UTC,I had issues with boiling clutch fluid after I did twins on a built DE. Changed to new dot 4 high temp fluid and no softness at all anymore. I'm running the factory slave and master cylinders with a competition stage 4 cluch. No issues

Had to replace a cam position sensor last year, but it was a simple DIY and cost about $70 and a half hour of my time. I've been very good about maintenance. Still runs great.  If I recall correctly, the '05s with the Revup engine may have a bit of an oil consumption issue, but not a concern if you top if off consistently.

Spent about $2000 in maintenance about 25k miles ago to do the clutch, flywheel, water pump, rear main seal, clutch master/slave and changed all clutch hydraulic piping to steel braids. (This included labor too)   Thing's that have went bad and needed to be swap were the window motors and the cam sensors. (Very common issue on these cars) Cost me about $250 dollars and very easy DIY. (Note that I rebuilt my window motors instead of buying a brand new one)  I swapped the differential bushing because it went out to a polyurethane bushing, everything costed me $350. It didn't really affected the drive-ability of the car but it might damage your axle and wheel bearings with prolong neglected use.  Upcoming stuff will be full suspension overhaul (I have 08 Nismo suspension on it right now that are starting to go), this will set me back about $3500, with all the polyurethane bushings and ungraded suspension arms."

That's entirely user error. The only reliability issue wasn't related to a design flaw.  It was untrained techs who didn't know how to lift a mid engine car and would crush the coolant pipes.  Or improperly bleed the system.
350z,3cg0w9,240ZT,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"I had one I bought new in 2003. Drove it from April 2003 to December 2007. I put about 62k on it. I shredded a power steering pump at around 45k and the radiator let go around 55k. Also blew a MAF sensor around 45k....which left me stranded on a major bridge during rush hour.  Other than religiously completed fluid changes, brakes, and lots of tires it was OK. I drove it hard and took it to a few HPDE's, so for it to have a few issues was not a major surprise."
350z,3cg0w9,mredding,2,Tue Jul 7 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"I have an 07 which seems to be the year they got all the kinks out with burning oil and tire feathering. Most of the older cars should have been fixed by now with recalls and aftermarket upgrades, but you can never be sure, I suppose. I'm terribly happy with the car, no major complaints.  But two minor complaints. First is the slave cylinder on the transmission likes to freeze in the winter. Your clutch pedal will stick to the floor. The other is that winter tires are an absolute necessity. Take it from me, I spun like a top at 60 MPH across 5 lanes of rush hour traffic from the exit lane to the fast lane, hooked facing the right direction, and still made my exit. On the OEM tires, flurries could strand the car at a back road stop sign. I had to keep a shovel and a broom in the car for those occasions. Winter tires solved all those problems entirely."
350z,3cg0w9,splinkymishmash,2,Wed Jul 8 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth pointing out that the wheels are staggered fitment, so you'll have to buy tires more frequently than you're probably used to."

Cam sensors go  but easy repair not that expensive, tires wear out quicker ... thats about it i have a 2005 and my wife has a 2006 besides regular wear and tear no issues and i drive mine really hard"

Do the required maintenance as scheduled religiously you will enhance the life of your car. I started at mile 3 on an 06 6spd mt and sit on 224k miles as I said below. 5 sets of tires, 3 batteries (one aftermarket was defective), 3 sets of belts, cam and crank sensors, 2 windshields  and clutch master & slave with line. No oil issues ever. I have driven it to Dallas TX and back, to Nova Scotia and back and down to FL and back , all from VA. It holds a lot in the trunk if you know how to  pack for a trip.  It was my DD until I purchased another vehicle this past December. Coincidentally,  the repairs on the sensors and clutch were needed after I stopped using it as a DD."

350z,3ceaql,TrinidadJam3s,2,Tue Jul 7 06:14:36 2015 UTC,I had my drivers side caliper seize on me after not 110% bleeding the brakes perfectly. Just replaced the old caliper with an A1 Cardone caliper and it's been fine ever since.
350z,3ceaql,Jaing008,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"The caliper isn't that hard to remove but it can be a pain. There is a rubber seal around the piston that is intended to keep out crud. Offhand I'm guessing that the seal has fallen apart and enough dust and grease have collected around the piston to keep it from retracting easily. Or it's possible (pretty unlikely I'd think) that the brake line has been crimped and it is holding pressure behind the piston?   There are plenty of instructions about removing the caliper and cleaning it online. The caliper is mounted to a bracket via 2 bolt-pins. Removing the uppermost bolt-pin frees the caliper to rotate and be removed. If you cannot get that bolt pin out don't even bother with the lower one, it functions as a sliding pin more than a bolt so it doesn't hold anything together. If the top bolt pin isn't removable you'll have to remove the entire bracket which is a pain in the ass on jack stands. There's limited space for getting a long breaker bar in there when you have the garage floor in the way.  If your mechanic wants to rebuild the calipers ask them for a price first and compare that to buying a new pair of calipers from Courtesy Parts. It turns out that labor for rebuilding the calipers can be almost as much as new calipers, so for the extra $100-and-change I'd just buy new parts and toss the old ones into the recycle bin."

350z,3cffk7,zts0005,2,Tue Jul 7 16:43:54 2015 UTC,They should have put the engine in the back so we would at least have some trunk space with that long hood up front haha
350z,3cffk7,Rawrsh,3,Tue Jul 7 17:18:05 2015 UTC,I actually find the trunk pretty spacious. Could probably fit more tires though without the bar in the way.
350z,3cffk7,zts0005,3,Tue Jul 7 22:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah the strut bar is a little inconvenient. I've only have to transport tires once but they were my rear tires. I have 285s on the back wheels and one was sticking out the trunk with the hatch open and the other took up the entire passenger seat area and touched my dash. Had to hang my head out the window for fresh air since it was pulling the exhaust in haha
350z,3cffk7,Rawrsh,2,Tue Jul 7 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"I remember one time I had to bring four drift spares and only had my Z. One over the bar, one in the spare tire well and two skinnier tires in the passenger. While inconvenient, it's good to know the Z can take four more tires."

The mechanics who did mine said it was one of the hardest bushing jobs they've done.  That rear one is a bitch.  I went with white line and it was amazing how good it felt.  I also did my transmission mount with a 75a urethane bushing and its loud as shit with a lot of vibration.  The car feels more put together, but I'm almost not sure its worth the noise and shit."

350z,3bzuba,Bosticles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:12:23 2015 UTC,I looked far and wide for a 60a but from I've seen z1 stopped making one.  If you find one in decent condition I'd be more than happy to trade you my 75a for it.
350z,3bzuba,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:27:57 2015 UTC,"I've got Z1's transmission mount in the car and love it. I put it in when I had factory catalytics and exchaust, and most of the noise was created when standing on the gas. It sort of made up for the lack of exhaust noise.   The 350Z has never really been a quiet car, so I don't find then trans mount to be that obnoxious. I don't really notice any sound from it when I'm at a constant speed, it's mostly during acceleration. And with the test pipes and exhaust it's hard to pick out the trans mount's sound."
350z,3bzuba,MDK350,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"I just did the diff. Still in the middle of installing a new limited slip, but I can comment on the bushing swap: its a huge pain. I tried using a bearing extractor, but that didnt work. Ended up doing the sawzall method. With a good saw and a fresh blade it wasnt too bad, but you still have to get the old rubber part out so that you can saw the race out."

350z,3bzuba,dezigner,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:41:54 2015 UTC,The Whiteline diff bushing is good.  It makes the diff whine a bit around 60mph. This is about half as loud as the solid aluminum diff I had in there before.  I haven't done the transmission bushing so I can't comment there.  I replaced most the suspension arms with adjustable units with poly bushings and they are all great.   No noise and tighter more predictable handling.  Installing bushings is just like any other car project. Make sure you have the right tools and it will go pretty smooth.

350z,3bwrft,NismoBro,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"Clean off as much rust as you can. Curb rash, just spray over it. It will hide a lot of the curb rash and it will be a lot less obvious.

You really dont have to worry about getting any on the tires either, it rubs right off the rubber. As for the second question, I took the front passenger wheel off, then realized I didn't really have to. I used garbage bags and tape to cover the other 3 rotors and just sprayed over them. It worked great!"
350z,3bwrft,alldayhangover,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:51:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I want to remove the rust off of the rotors so I'll probably end up taking the wheels off anyways. I just don't know when to put the jack and jack stands on a Z. Also should I dip the inside of the rims as well since I'm taking the whole wheel off?
350z,3bwrft,relited,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:32:57 2015 UTC,"Np.  I use a rolling lift on the front and rear jack points and place 4 jack stands on the four side jack points. Diagram: http://i.imgur.com/uXhcqzZ.jpg  As for the inside of the rims, you can but I wouldn't. Mine were already black inside there and if (when) you get brake dust building up back there it will be easier to clean off without the dip."

350z,3bw8lf,ProfessorSwank,3,Thu Jul 2 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"On a track? There are tracks of all shapes, lengths, elevations, widths etc. So there are already a huge amount of variables there. I've seen 600 horsepower Corvettes get lapped by 300 horsepower Civics at Tsukuba because of the size of the track and the skill of the driver.   Most importantly it's not really a question of which car would win on a track as compared to which driver would win on said track. You need a constant with the LEAST amount of variables to come to a confident conclusion as to which car would win (and to avoid any Johns that come from the loser).  Unless of course you meant like a drag strip? Which takes less skill IMO and is a much more reliable constant than a circuit track. In that case, it's still up to the driver to win but skill only brings to marginally closer to victory in terms of launching and shifting ability as opposed to maintaining the latter as well as turning, braking and sticking to the optimal race line for your car.  EDIT: Also a drag race only determines the straight line ability of the car not its overall ability. Using my example from above, that 300hp civic would obviously get smoked by that 600hp Corvette, but because its super-light, powered up and handles much better than the Corvette, it's able to lap that thing on smaller tracks.  Also you didn't specify the year for either cars, I'm not sure about the 944 models but there is about a 20 horsepower difference and many other performance differences between an 03 and an 08."
350z,3bw8lf,penisinthepeanutbttr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:16 2015 UTC,I guess i need to eliminate more variables then thx for the reply

The 944 Turbo has about a 250 pound weight advantage but the Z has about 70 HP and 20 lb-ft advantage.  He was quicker on the a several of the tighter corners (lighter car, no surprise) but on the faster corners I could definitely carry more speed. I think my advantage was car setup.  Overall I'd say that on a typical track it would mostly be down to driver and car setup but I'd expect the Z to have an easier time of it."

Slotted rotors won't really buy you much of anything on the street. Drilled rotors are death, avoid them like the plague. For pads the Hawk and StopTech street pads are good. I don't know that I've ever seen any that are truly ""low dust"" so I don't buy into that marketing hype. I was very unimpressed with the EBC pads."
350z,3bsxk0,TreeFiddyZ,2,Thu Jul 2 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"I'll say maybe, depending upon the car's year and ECU firmware and whether you do the install on a weekday or a weekend. If you're unlucky you will wind up with a Bank1 or 2 Lean check engine light a few weeks after the install. You can fix that via a tune.   Look into the UpRev tune for the Z33. You can have them mail you a pre-made setup for not that much money, or if there is a shop that sells their stuff you can spend a reasonable amount of money and get it done custom on a dyno."
350z,3bsxk0,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"You certainly can if you want... But you'll want it tuned to take advantage of less restriction on the exhaust. You'll also want to be clear on DEQ for awhile since the DEQ typically requires catalytic converters, which you won't have with test pipes. I also recommend a good resonator by a shop so you don't have a ton of rasp. The tune will allow you to gain the most power from the mods."
350z,3bsxk0,DomHaynie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:42:55 2015 UTC,"Great! So it's best to get a catback, test pipe, and tune right? I want to keep the engine as stock as possible for reliabilities sake.  wanted to go un-resonated though :/"
350z,3bsxk0,DomHaynie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"I have no resonator, and its noticeably louder. My wife drove it the other night and I was shocked by how the car shook the neighborhood (she never drives it, and there's a Borla system). Just the Borla and an Injen Cold Air Intake added 27 ft. lbs. of torque and took it from 287 hp to 310 hp (at the crank, whp I would have to refer to the dyno results because I can't remember).  But without a resonator, if I'm flooring it, it is very loud, but 3500-5K RPMs is a raspy. But the effect that it gives bystanders and other drivers is definitely worth it. I have my exhaust comparison video on YouTube, but I don't have one that shows driving after I had the shop cut out the resonator."

350z,3brpqx,tobythesandwich,-1,Thu Jul 2 10:51:09 2015 UTC,Find a good used engine? A quick browse of car-part shows $1k-$2k for different mileage ranges.  That's in my area at least. You could get refurbished.  But I think at your mileage a used is a better bet.  Just know what you're buying and ask about the condition of the car it came out of. Also daily driving a Z...  Dunno why people do these sorts of things.    Edit: What coward is down voting me for giving legitimate advice?

I enjoy sporty cars. But daily driving a Z33 sounds like torture to me.  Not that I don't like mine.  But it makes the time I spend in it more special. Rather than the mundane driving experience I have day to day in my Xterra. Edit: thought you were OP.  My bad. It's nothing wrong with daily driving a Z33. It's just not for me.  And I think it's still a tad bit strange when people daily cars meant more for weekend use.  Although I guess I'm guilty of it because I spent 3 years daily driving a built Z28."

350z,3bnh65,cancerousiguana,3,Tue Jun 30 22:47:36 2015 UTC,That's way too much. That much mileage should be around 6-7k max if it's well maintained and he's got receipts to prove it. I paid $5900 for an 04 with 180k. Keep in mind you will be putting money into repairs when you buy a high mileage car.
350z,3bnh65,Slipping_Tire,2,Tue Jun 30 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I just paid $11,000 for a 2003 350Z Track with 57,000 miles. Garage kept so the paint is still great, full service records."

350z,3bnh65,dgerny,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:20:57 2015 UTC,Keep in mind aftermarket additions don't add value to a vehicle. Some might even argue it degrades value to an extent.   Keep searching. The right Z is worth the wait.

From there, i've had to replace the entire rear subframe, control arms, driveshaft, and clutch. Some of this I made out okay on, being I could do it myself. Other stuff, i had to farm out.    Bottom line? Don't pay 12k for a HR. It's not worth it. 14k would be minimum, and make sure you try to do a pull in second gear, and get all the way to the proper speed before the rev limiter hits. The Clutch held fine in the 6th gear test, but really laying on the HP in 2nd at the top of the range it cost me 4-5mph.. a big deal autoxing."

When I bought my Z, the previous owner told me he lost his keys at one point, so he went to the dealership for a new set and they wanted some absurd amount of money (per key) to match it to the vehicle electronics.   As such, he only did one, so my spare key will only open my doors. If you try and use it to start the car, it'll do a similar thing and crank indefinitely."

350z,3b9i23,daudnighthawk,3,Sat Jun 27 03:27:47 2015 UTC,The corvette just feels massive compared to the Z. I'm still not used to such a long car. The seats are a little more comfortable in the vette but it's not to such an extreme that it bothers me much. I prefer the Z's dashboard. Both cars feel fast but the torque of the corvette is a totally different beast. I also feel like I shift more smoothly in the Z as the corvette can feel clunky sometimes but maybe that's because I'm not yet used to it.

I'm saving for 4.08, aftermarket LSD ( haven't decided on brand), nismo diff cover, and whiteline bushings. Had the 4.08s on my previous Z and I'm looking forward to doing it again.  Oh one more thing, if you ever plan on going turbo/supercharged the 4.08 will make things pretty hairy in 2nd and probably 3rd, so keep that in mind.

350z,3azoe1,NikoNub,2,Thu Jun 25 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"For street and autocross the stock diff is fine. People like to upgrade because various aftermarket diffs provide better engagement for the circuit, drag, or drifting. Not that you can't do all that with the stock set up but it tends to wear out with age/use and kinda sucks. I don't have a personal basis for comparison though.  I'll be switching mine out after I get a lot of seat time drifting on the stocker."

Get a plenum spacer, maybe some cat deletes, used, and you will hear and feel a little gain. When I was getting seriously close to boosting, I was quoted 19k and 22k. Roughly needs an engine rebuild to operate at 400+ hp safely. And by safely, I mean won't shit out after a couple months. Take a look at the forums, tons of good information there in this subject. Best of luck."
350z,3azoe1,ItsGnar,3,Wed Jun 24 20:56:12 2015 UTC,I mean not really. I would however recommend tracking your car with minimal engine mods.

350z,3azoe1,MDK350,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:03 2015 UTC,Yea that's not bad. But if you think about it that's quite a bit for gains of under 30hp. Nice setup though.

350z,3azoe1,TheStig827,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:57:33 2015 UTC,Not much really; a plenum spacer and maybe a minor intake improvement (e.g. '06 stock intake with a K&N filter) are the only inexpensive and worthwhile mods I know of for '03~'04; if you have the '05 Rev-up engine it may differ a bit.

Show up early, get your car teched, and walk the course. Then walk it again. then walk it again with the novice walkthrough. If you don't run first heat, get a ride along or two with someone that knows what they are doing. You get a good idea of where to go and what to do.   Take your first run and see the track at speed. Don't worry about being the fastest dude out there and setting the world on fire. Once you know what your looking for it really isn't all that bad.

As far as loudness I'd place it above Nismo, Stillen, Invidia (Gemini, not N1 or whatever the call the one with the cans) and Borla, but not as loud as Motordyne and definitely not as loud as Topspeed Pro-1 (the original version that looks similar to the Invidia N1, not the newer HKS-replica).

Could just be bad.     Mine had got wet from the rains (the diverter panel thingy had broke), so it was shorting out.  Yours may just be going out and the heat is bringing the symptoms out."
350z,3ar7lj,TheZeven,2,Mon Jun 22 22:02:35 2015 UTC,That would be the IPDM. Replacing it is Nissan's first step in the troubleshooting process. The new part is quite expensive but you might be able to find a used one with a warranty from somewhere like Automotix.
350z,3ar7lj,TreeFiddyZ,2,Tue Jun 23 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Ding ding ding this is the correct answer.   You can run a test on your IPDM to make sure everything is great:  Open left hand/driver door.  Turn IGNITION OFF  Turn IGNITION ON  Within 20 seconds push door switch (The black button on the frame of the car that makes the windows seal up) 10 times and turn IGNITION OFF.

350z,3ao0y7,Nota_throwawaylolol,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:27:58 2015 UTC,3k i would say is the best just because of how the engine kinda changes tone kinda sounds more agressive at like 3.5k so id say 3k is more economical

The kit will also come with the harness necessary to attach the head unit to the factory wiring without cutting any of the factory wiring, which is also extremely important.  The only drawback on these pioneer units is all the touchscreens except the most expensive ones, are resistive touch as opposed to capacitive (all modern devices are capacitive touch and have been for 7+ years). I'm torn on whether I want to trade cost for functionality (as in spend more, get less)."
350z,3anju8,u3h,2,Mon Jun 22 01:14:04 2015 UTC,To add too this the only splicing and connecting you'll do is from the head unit to the harness that plugs into your factory harness.

350z,3afgqr,scmn182,2,Fri Jun 19 18:25:17 2015 UTC,"Lowering is typically done via springs, which also have the largest impact on road feel. So you can kill 2 birds with 1 stone. First I would see if you can get a clear view of the suspension to see what brand it is and if there are any markings that would indicate the model. That will let you see if they did something strange like pairing the factory shocks with aftermarket springs. And it's possible that the suspension may be adjustable so you could dial some of the stiffness out of it. Adjustability isn't that likely, but you should at least check before spending money on replacements. And if the car is sitting on the factory shocks then you should consider replacing them. 2005 vintage shocks would be near the end of their lifespan and if you're going to spend money on labor to replace the springs you might as well do the shocks at the same time.  I've never tried mixing and matching springs and shocks, I've only bought packaged sets. So I'll let someone else comment on the idea of you just buying somewhat softer springs and whether you should get shocks at the same time."

350z,3adauh,MURPHYJOHNSON,2,Fri Jun 19 18:45:23 2015 UTC,The lightest the Z33 got was around 3200#. You're not going to be able to remove enough significant weight to drop it below that and maintain the weight distribution.  Removing the a/c is pointless because the compressor and condenser weigh around 20#. Great.  Now the interior is unbearable in the sun.  And you still have 180#+ to go. Are you building a sole purpose track car? Or something primarily for the street with the occasional track day?
350z,3adauh,tobythesandwich,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:35:58 2015 UTC,How far are you willing to go? I've seen guys on my350z who stripped their complete interior except for the driver seat
350z,3adauh,ItsGnar,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:22:29 2015 UTC,"The best I've ever heard was ~2900 lbs after gutting the interior completely, including no dashboard, no door panels, no AC components, even removing structurally unnecessary pieces of metal and the muffler. You can get even less by swapping out lighter weight components, but that gets expensive quickly. I don't know how this effected his weight distribution, but if you can get your weight down first, you can always add ballast.  I've only heard that you can replace the rear and door windows with acrylic, but I've never seen it on the market, but I haven't really looked, either. You can't replace the front windshield as that's safety glass and probably no one would make such a thing anyway.  So how light can you realistically get? How deep are your pockets?"

For me, at least, the problem is with the lifters. I'm gonna try to add some additive and see if it decreases or fixes the noise. My Z is at 123K and it's not really worth it for me to try and replace the lifters.  I'm not sure for you but in my case, the clicking is loud enough that it is noticeable in the cabin if you listen carefully. It's amplified even more when I'm stopped next to another car. Honestly, you could just keep driving it and as long as it doesn't start leaking, you should be okay (shitty advice, I know lol) I'll update if I find any other solution."

350z,3a492c,BlueTokui-Waza,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:43:44 2015 UTC,Timing Chain guides are probably splitting. Common issues on VQs. Swap them out and swap out the tensioner and water pump while you're at it.
350z,3a46ia,Senor_Cheezy,5,Wed Jun 17 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the car as it is. TTG is right when it comes to the cost of maintenance when you race. It gets expensive quick. The 350z is a heavier car and isn't particularly fast in a straight line. If you insist on doing something, I would focus on handling and leave the motor alone; you can spend thousands and wont that make much over stock HP. At most 300rwhp without digging into the motor itself. Unless you go boosted, which is expensive.    Replace ALL the bushings with poly, replace the transmission mount with a solid mount, get coilovers, strut bars, and a good set of tires. That's all you need for a fun daily driver/weekend track car."
350z,3a46ia,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,3,Wed Jun 17 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"Both /u/ttgspeed & /u/Do_it_in_a_Datsun are correct. The thing that you should keep in mind is that you won't be damaging the car you'll just be making it wear much faster. So for instance the rear differential bushings are known to fail eventually, tracking that car will turn eventually into now. But once you replace the bushings with better ones they will last for years of trackdays.  I track the car 5 or more weekends a year. In addition to the normal things that need work on a 10 year old car I've also had to replace bushings, ball joints, brake calipers, radiator, and I'm about to replace the driver's seat. As long as you plan ahead and stay within a budget it's not unmanageable.  The Z is a heavy car so the biggest price you'll pay at a trackday is when you screw up and go off track. You can easily damage the suspension or front ball joints for instance. And of course drag racing is hard on clutch and transmission."
350z,3a46ia,TreeFiddyZ,2,Wed Jun 17 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"As often as you can afford to repair it. Racing is not good for your car, period. If you drive it hard, you will need to replace things.  Based on your remark about waiting for your uncle, it sounds as if you are quite young and not in a position to drop thousands on repairs on a regular basis.  If that's true, I would refrain from racing."

I have been driving a 1996 Jimmy (its a POS) for a while as I saved up money. I am really excited for a new car hopefully I can find the right 350z. Im 23 about to graduate college so money is really tight right now. So the possibility of making expensive repairs definitely outweighs the fun of going to the track, as much as id like to do it. I will just have to enjoy the 350z on some late night cruises when no one is on the road."

Wings increase drag with the benefit of downforce, usually outside of the air that is influenced by the body (which is why they're so high up). It isn't uncommon to have both. The stock R32 GT-R for example has both.  I get why it's fun to bash on a car like this but the spoiler/wing combo is actually functional when applied correctly."

If you're at stock power the brembos with good pads and rotors would be a good place to start. Wheels and tires. Lighter, wider wheels with sticky tires. Oil cooler. These cars need one. Upgrade the LSD. Upgrade the suspension. Get some decent coilovers and corner weight it. Replace the bushings. Adjustable end-links."

350z,39rdkg,alohroh,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"The 350Z is a very trackable car. Engine and brake heat are it's first problem areas. I didn't follow your budget rules simply because you prioritize things based on your driving style and local track. Texas World Speedway requires better brakes then Harris Hill Road for instance.  For a novice things like these are the place to start:   Hi temp brake, power steering, and clutch fluid Synthetic oil in transmission and diff Adjustable sway bars and Whiteline endlinks (At the very least) Track edition Brembo calipers, or the 370Z Akebono kit if you prefer StopTech floating front rotors and 1 piece rears Dedicated brake pads, Carbotech XP12 front, XP12 or 10 rear A set of wheels such as Enkei RPF1 9.5x18 or staggered 9.5 & 10 x18. The RPF1s are great because so many people use them it's typically pretty easy to find a replacement for one if you lose an argument with a curb. An oil cooler A roll of this stuff to help you stay in the seat comfortably.   Once you start picking up speed then you'll find yourself in need of things like:   Stiffer suspension Bushing replacements The Mishimoto radiator + fans Disabling the VDC (the OFF button does NOT disable it) Stiffer differential bushings An upgraded differential Sticky tires. A lot of organizations won't let you use anything below 140 until you reach a more advanced run group. Learn to drive on Pilot Super Sports or Yokohama AD08 and then move towards R compounds. A trailer hitch and trailer so you don't have to drive those R compounds to the track Racing seats + 5 point harnesses + 4 point cage    On the bright side a lot of these things can be covered as part of your normal maintenance on the car. Suspension for instance wears out eventually so you can use that as an opportunity for an upgrade. The same goes for bushings. And even brake calipers, rebuilding the 1 pot calipers isn't worth it, so when they start to stick just upgrade."

350z,39nyzb,Nembus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:05:32 2015 UTC,210 is normal. 100* Texas heat and pushing my car the needle stays a tad below half. And the its its normal for the fans to kick on at idle. Whoever told you powers decreased after 200* is feeding you a line of shit  My motorcycle runs to 220 before the fans kick on so this is completely normal for the z. 200* is cold compared to what the internal temperature of the engine is.
350z,39nyzb,u3h,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"The car shouldn't really run at 210 unless the ambient temps are 35C / 95F. Or unless you're running it hard as in repeated acceleration or in stop/go traffic w/little airflow.   Try taking it to a DIY car wash and blast the hell out of the front side of the radiator with high pressure water. Or try compressed air  I suppose. The plastic grill doesn't make it easy but you might be able to remove some crud from the radiator/condenser cores. And as long as you don't actually touch the fins you shouldn't do any harm.  The car collects an impressive (or depressing, your choice) amount of crud between the condenser and radiator cores. Crud being packed dirt, the stems from leaves, insect bits, etc.. If you are comfortable with a screw driver then look into the procedure for replacing the radiator and you can inspect what's between the 2 cores. Basically you loosen the fans, loosen the radiator core's top fasteners, then carefully tip the top of the radiator towards the engine and stuff a flashlight into the gap to have a look. Stick a couple of super bright work lights in front of the grill so you have some light that should be at least slightly visible between the cores. What I saw was maybe 20% blockage due to crud. I solved that by installing a Mishimoto radiator+fans but I also track the car so I had ulterior motives. You can probably find a way to clean that out w/o damaging the fins. Worst case you remove the radiator clean everything and then put it back. A pretty simple afternoon DIY project.  EDIT: Oh, and in case anyone isn't aware the temp guage in the Z33 is artificial. The computer sets it at about 40% until the car starts overheating, around 220F, then it rapidly spikes to 90+% at which point you are moments away from it overheating and going into limp mode. As OP noted ODB2 is the only way to see a real temp."

350z,39illo,OwnerOfHell,-5,Fri Jul 3 12:00:12 2015 UTC,My simple answer is always don't. Replace with stock if you can. Some aftermarket bumpers can be quality so if you can find one then sweet but usually they are horrible quality
350z,39illo,ItsGnar,4,Fri Jun 12 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"there are alot of quality options out there, as long as OP doesn't touch crappy replicas or try to cheap out.   bottomline: you get what you pay for.  with that said, most if not all authentic kits will be a guarantee fit. reputable replica manufactures like shine auto also makes kits that fit nicely."
350z,39illo,osborn1201,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:37:30 2015 UTC,"Even the top makers have fitment issues a lot of the time. The absolute one thing you must have is someone who knows what they are doing after the initial install. I guarantee you will need your body work guy\paint guy to fix small imperfections as well as any damage you may cause making the fitment perfect. After they apply the bondo or whatever filler and sand make sure you do not cheap out on the paint process. This will make all the difference. Unless you are going to shell out for poly urethane aftermarket pieces which are usually ridiculously priced. I suggest you just get OEM, after market kits are going to chip unless you never take your car over 30 or stay 1000 ft back from any other car."
350z,39illo,wvubeerme,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"i never heard people have a lot of issues with their authentic kits all these time i've been on my350z. everyone who is needed extra works are almost all replicas.   and what you said pretty much proved my points, OP shouldn't be cheaping out on parts and get crappy replicas if he decided to go with aftermarket parts.   i'm not sure why chipping would be a reason to get OEM instead though. the paint is gonna chip regardless of what kits you get without proper paint protection in place."
350z,39dxa4,MeSkata,4,Thu Jun 11 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"I bought an '04 with 150k miles for $6k. I'm at 161k now and I have only done some small maintenance things that the previous owner neglected. And it doesn't leak or burn a drop oil.  The biggest thing was a small miss that I was trying to track down, so I went with new NGK spark plugs and an air filter. I also found a vacuum line that had slipped off, but in the cold, it would still miss a little. My next step was to check the coils and I found that they were all made by hanshin or something. Basically, it was Chinese junk. One thing you'll learn with this car is that the 350z almost requires OEM sensors and ignition parts to run well. It will save you a ton of headache if you follow that rule. It ran me about $260 to put some hitachi coils on there and it's run like a top since then.   I don't beat on it too much, but I drive it like it was meant to be driven. I usually drive around with the tach between 3k and 4k and I usually get it up to or near redline about once a day.   Like I said, it runs like a top, but they can be finicky. I would suggest trying to find one that has the least possible number of mods. Mine still has the stock airbox, stock exhaust, and doesn't even have a plenum spacer. Will it have a little more power with mods and a tune? Yes, but mods will decrease the life of the engine.  If you go with a 6mt, another big thing to look for in the early years is the synchros wearing out. If one of the previous owners mis-shifted one too many times, then the synchros will probably be shot. You'll get a nice crunch when changing gears(most notably from 5th to 6th). When that happens, the only solution is to rebuild/replace the transmission. Nissan fixed the weak synchros in the later years and most people who have that issue just swap to the modern CD009 because it is a direct replacement and it doesn't cost much more than a rebuild. I lucked out there too, I don't think my synchros are perfect, but I don't have the crunching that a lot of people experienced with the earlier years.  Lastly, if you go to check some 350z's out, check the state of the clutch. Put it in 6th gear at about 60mph and floor the gas, if the revs stay low, then the clutch is good. If the revs start to climb, then the clutch is slipping and is probably on its way out.  So, if you treat it right and keep up with a little maintenance, there's no reason a high mileage Z shouldn't last you a long time.  Edit: formatting  Edit: One more thing, I mentioned the oil because oil consumption is a known problem on some 05-06 models and some of the 03 models. From what I've gathered, it is more of a hit and miss problem. Some Z's from those years have it, some don't. It was a bit of a gamble, but keep that in mind as well."
350z,39dxa4,Master_Cheddar,2,Thu Jun 11 03:18:31 2015 UTC,"Paid $5900 for my 04 with 180k, knowing it was a project. Have probably put about $3000 into it but that includes rims that weren't needed, a transmission that wasn't totally needed but I wanted, and a $700 emergency cooling system repair at a shop that should've cost about $200 at home. So I'm say $9000 into the car but I'm confident that it's all sorted out because I did it myself. I'd say 9k isn't an outlandish budget depending on your experience with working on cars."

I ordered all the parts under $200 and have already installed the lower control arm with the other parts still in transit.  Other than that it was a really clean car and pretty taken care of.  I think i got an ok deal, not a great deal.  I am capable of fixing any issues that arise though, so i wasn't too worried about buying a higher milage car.  It all depends on your situation, but 8-9K for the early 03-04's is pretty darn expensive.  I would bide your time and find a really nice one for that budget or get a much cheaper one and fix all the problems yourself.  Either way, good luck and i hope you find a good one!!  P.S.

350z,3983pv,Bosticles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you let the clutch bite without any gas, normally the car would start to move forward slowly.

350z,394may,roflwafflecg,4,Tue Jun 9 05:45:00 2015 UTC,"The first thing to try is to pull off your battery terminal connectors and clean your terminals. I've seen exactly this happen when the ground terminal connector had some corrosion on it. If that doesn't work, get the battery tested. If the battery is fine, but dead, either it is your alternator or you have some sort of power-drain from the system you installed.  Alternatively, the whirring you mention could be the starter, and that could be your problem, if all the power issues are fine."
350z,394may,absurdparadox,2,Tue Jun 9 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"That click from the video. I heard it before with my kia and it was the starter. If it was the battery, unless it was completly drained you would hear a low pitched rotating whine and then the click. I may be wrong, this advice comes from my personal experiences."
350z,394may,Quest4life,3,Tue Jun 9 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"http://youtu.be/fsZwEponVlU Hard to describe and you can't hear it in the video, but when holding the key in the start position it makes a high pitched electricalish whining noise. I'm guessing it's the alternator as my voltage on the battery is normal(and if it was just a low battery I'd assume it'd at least crank a bit) as well as the car randomly shutting off before it happened, but I'm no expert. I'm sure I've put a ton of stress on it recently as I've put in a 1200w sub as well Any thoughts?"
350z,394may,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:33:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds like low battery to me.  Mine does this exactly when I let it sit for a while and the battery gets low.  Why is the battery low?  Could very well be dead alternator too.  Quick way to check would be to check the battery voltage, jump start the car, disconnect jumper cables, and re-check the voltage.  The voltage while running should be ~14 volts if the alternator is doing its thing.  I would not recommend charging the battery from dead with the alternator, throw a charger on there.  Lastly, it sounds like you're running a sound system so it's safe to say you've done some messing with your wiring, I would re-check all your grounds."
350z,394may,tajonny07,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"To add to this, one time my battery terminals randomly got corroded and I had the same symptoms. Once i disconnected the terminals, scrubbed everything clean, and reconnected it all, it worked fine.   Also, a 1200w amp is going to pull a TON of power from your battery so it's possible that your amp is pulling too much power... I know some people with serious sound system either get a 2nd battery specifically for the amp. Or you could look into upgrading your battery to one with a bit more juice.  Also, rule of thumb is for every 1000W you need 1 power capacitor. This will store up a ton of electrical power and feed it directly to your amp more efficiently and take the stress off your car battery."

350z,3945tw,TrinidadJam3s,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience if the oil pressure is really low at idle the oil level is probably low.  I've also noticed a much bigger difference between idle and high rev oil pressure when the engine oil is low.  The pressure you're getting at idle is normal.  I'd wager your friend needs to check his oil, like yesterday.  He's probably close to 2 quarts low."

350z,3945tw,Boond0ck,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible.  When I bough mine the engine was 2 quarts low.  At idle the oil pressure was very low, and under hard acceleration the pressure went way up.  When I checked the oil it was barely at the low level marker on the dip stick.  And don't follow the instructions in the owners manual.  It's incredibly difficult to get s clear reading even after letting the engine site for 15 minutes.  I check mine in the morning after its been sitting all night."

350z,3945tw,Boond0ck,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yup.  It's a bitch to get a good reading.  That's why it's really best to let it sit overnight before taking a reading.  I will say that if you try 3 or 4 times you can get a clear reading after adding oil, but that doesn't make up for the design by any means.  Once you get to know your car it gets easier.  At this point I know I've got about 1,000-1,500 miles after an oil change before I've gotta add a quart.  And I think the exaggerated disparity between you idle oil pressure, and oil pressure under hard acceleration, is good tell that you probably need to add some oil."

Do that on fresh tires and a straight, fairly level road with a long clear view, check your rims for cracks before you begin.  You'll get ~350 miles per tank, in my experience."
350z,3924a1,Tigerballs07,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:37:16 2015 UTC,Amazing info. I assumed the V6 made it not as nimble as the Miata. Anything I should look out for when buying? Thanks again!
350z,3924a1,Tigerballs07,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"The 07 and 08 have some trouble with the slave cylinder (the clutch spring is 50 lbs, so there's a hydraulic assist), the 08 had it a lot worse. Plenty of people replace it with a better aftermarket model. I've only ever had problems in the cold winter, the thing likes to freeze and the clutch pedal sticks to the floor, so I should probably replace mine, too. But in the summer, zero problems. If I were you, I'd wait until a problem developed before bothering.  The 07 got just about everything right, all the previous years were hit or miss regarding suspension and engine problems, where tires were feathering or the engine burned oil. So if you're to buy an older model, look through the forum here and online, the problems are well documented and easy to look for.  Just look for signs of use and abuse as you would any car."
350z,3924a1,Tigerballs07,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:45:38 2015 UTC,I've driven both. The Miata is far more 'fun' but less power on the high end.   My buddies and I toy around in his Miata in the snow and it feels like a powered sled. I'd prefer my Z on the highway any day though.
350z,3924a1,schniederzero,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:50:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm leaning more and more toward the Z. I have never owned a RWD car, so have nothing to compare it to, but I really want something fun through the curves and powerful on the straights. Plus, love the looks of some of the customized Zs I've seen."
350z,391le8,schniederzero,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:14:25 2015 UTC,Same as the coupe but you cant use the top anymore.
350z,38y033,DeanGulberry6591,4,Sun Jun 7 20:21:51 2015 UTC,You can use the antenna from a Honda s2000 which looks good and has great reception. Also you can buy it straight from the dealership for around 20 bucks.
350z,38y033,4NIC8N,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:43:16 2015 UTC,That one looks a bit big too almost as big as stock.
350z,38y033,Quizzie,3,Sun Jun 7 21:47:32 2015 UTC,"That depends. The S2000 is a similar length to stock, but it doesn't have a skinny portion that comes out. http://i.imgur.com/uMT51K3h.jpg  That being said, some people on 350ztech seem to vouch for the 1.5"" Mangowalk http://www.mangowalk.com/index.php?sku=30159  There's also a discussion on my350z http://my350z.com/forum/exterior-and-interior/479466-official-shorty-antenna-thread-2.html  Based on what you seem to be looking for, I'd probably try out the Mangowalk since it's about as short as you're going to get. If it doesn't work out then maybe settle for the Dodge one or something."
350z,38y033,BlueXTC,2,Mon Jun 8 11:04:41 2015 UTC,There is a wire that on the Z needs to be used as the amplifier for the signal. If it was not attached you have crap reception. Best Buy can sort it for you at the install dept.
350z,38y033,dallacious,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, definitely not the wiring. I wired it. And I'm 100% sure I wired it right."
350z,38y033,BlueXTC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:55:18 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate? I've always had terrible reception and am wondering if that's the cause
350z,38y033,cancerousiguana,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:07:02 2015 UTC,"I did not do the install but after a ""professional "" shop installed my new double din I had no real signal coming through on any to speak of.  When I went to have the Sirius kit installed the tech at Best Buy pointed out that the wire for an electric antenna on the head unit was used as a signal amplifier on the Z due to the wiring configuration."
350z,38y033,WarlizardsCousin,2,Mon Jun 8 10:51:29 2015 UTC,I went the Dodge Avenger route. Looks great and haven't had any problems at all with reception. Plus it was like 8 bucks or something on amazon.
350z,38y033,cancerousiguana,2,Mon Jun 8 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Same, zero problems with reception and it screws right on."

350z,38y033,Spank_hamma,2,Mon Jun 8 00:56:28 2015 UTC,I believe it was for an 08. At least that's what I searched for.
350z,38y033,ItsGnar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:49:13 2015 UTC,Just FYI...I cut the antenna on mine and left the stubby part intact. Worked just fine. A little dab of black paint on the very tip and voila.
350z,38y033,ItsGnar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:57:39 2015 UTC,Got any pictures ? And you mean the stock antenna ? Or the s2k one ? Seen on the my350z people use the dodge avenger one too
350z,38y033,nathanwl2004,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"I literally cut my stock antenna, the actual antenna part, not the stubby black part. It works just fine and no one is the wiser.

350z,38y033,nathanwl2004,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:20:33 2015 UTC,I use an antenna from cravenspeed. It has good reception. It isn't as good as stock but its pretty damn good. And its made of solid aluminum and is only 3 inches tall I believe. I would recommend it
350z,38y033,boraca,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:52:29 2015 UTC,I have a inch one and it looks so good. Just can't catch shit out of it !! I rarely use the radio I would just like to have it when I want it

350z,38y033,alohroh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:33:22 2015 UTC,I always wonder about the short solid metal ones I see. The stock one has a lot of give to it in case it get caught on something. I always wonder what would happen if the solid ones get caught.

350z,38xeig,thomas_mkvgti,5,Sun Jun 7 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"Modifying the car will significantly decrease the life expectancy but it sounds like you already know that.  Where do you live? If you're planning on driving this as your daily you need to understand how squirrely it gets in ice/snow and even rain.  What modifications are you planning?  Have you looked around a lot? 18k for 42k enthusiast seems a tad high.  Love her, respect her power, and keep her clean :)"
350z,38xeig,anphrax,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"I live in Virginia so there is some snow but everything closes so I won't have to drive much in it.   Im planning on simple modifications while its my daily, stuff like full exhaust, intake, coilovers, aftermarket wheels and tires, and maybe a tune. Then any exterior stuff will be simple and clean looking.   Yeah I have looked around and there are a few other 350z's that I could get."
350z,38xeig,Spank_hamma,2,Sun Jun 7 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"According to another post you made, you live in VA. I do too, and I owned a 350 and currently own a 370.  First, don't make the mistake I did. 18k for a 08 350 with 42k is too much. Do not buy that. (That's how much I paid for mine with 35k miles because I was an idiot.)  Second, I hope that you have a back up plan during winter. This past winter I drove the 370 in 2 inches of snow and it was squirrely as fuck.  Third, the VQ is a good engine. Beware of oil consumption and be ready for a clutch swap, mine was pretty bad. I only did a head unit swap on mine, the 350 sucks for stereo swap because of limited room and two stupid ass bolts behind the hatch.   Other than that, I loved the shit out of my 350, it's a great car. Best of luck, any questions and I'm happy to oblige."
350z,38xeig,BlueXTC,2,Sun Jun 7 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"I am in Virginia as well. 224k miles on the dial from mile 5. 06 base 6spd mt. Thus far 5 sets of tires,  2 batteries,  2 sets of belts,  recently in the last 6 months cam and crank sensors and will be replacing clutch slave and master soon.  No oil issues."
350z,38xeig,Sampson209,2,Mon Jun 8 00:45:13 2015 UTC,18k is a little to pricy. I got my HR with 62k for 11.5k and I had to replace master/slave cylinder and clutch. Good luck man!
350z,38xeig,Zrepsilon,2,Mon Jun 8 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"I would highly advise driving one to see if you can live with the road noise. I always heard people complain and complain about it and I thought it couldn't possibly be that bad. Having daily driven one for three months now (60 miles round trip) I will tell you it is something that is ever present, but you get used to it."
350z,38xeig,Alj23,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"I'd take the advice of the people saying that 18K for what you're thinking about buying is way too much. Like one guy said, you can get a nicer Nismo for that. There's actually a 2008 Nismo near my area going for just above 19K. It's sick as fuck."
350z,38vcac,Alj23,12,Sun Jun 7 03:33:33 2015 UTC,Like Mourcore said it's the drivers. I've actually saved my self from some pretty bad accidents becuase of the quick response and stability of my Z. If I were in any other car during those scenarios i would have crashed for sure. Best thing you can do if your getting a Z or really any car is to spend time understanding its limits before you do anything irrational on the streets.
350z,38vcac,cshadow350z,2,Sun Jun 7 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. I'm really hoping my parents see that too.    Will I have fun with it, which means giving it some gas? Of course I will, it's inevitable. It's a sports car. But I respect the power it has. Will I go all crazy the moment I get it and wrap it around a tree on the way home? Hell no. I'd respect the car and its power way too much to risk that until I have become accustomed to the vehicle and known all its ins and outs, it quirks and kicks.    Key point here is respect of how much power it has, and what it can do. I'd hate to let it get away from me and injure myself, or someone else for that matter. No amount of fun is worth mine or someone else's life."
350z,38vcac,Bosticles,3,Sun Jun 7 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"I got my first one when I was 19, and I drove like a granny until I was comfortable with the power.  A few months later I crossed a 45MPH street at the same time someone was going about 90mph over the hill in that street.  If I hadn't been able to drop the clutch and put some power down I would have been tboned and more than likely dead.    To me, its a safety feature to be able to move your car quickly, provided you're experienced and alert.  If you like texting, or dicking with the radio, or can't stay in the lines, don't get a 350z, because the power will kill you."
350z,38vcac,Bosticles,2,Sun Jun 7 15:52:19 2015 UTC,"That's a great way to put it. Safety in necessary power. I haven't been in a situation just like that yet, but it will most likely happen sometime.   If you don't mind me asking, how much was your insurance at 19? Being allowed to get the car is the first obstacle. Finding one in good condition for a good price is the second. Being able to afford it after, including insurance is the third."
350z,38vcac,Mourcore,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't remember.  My parents had access to my bank account and took out the money for me.  It wasn't cheap, but I have a clean accident record so it didn't cripple me.  Then again, I postponed college a few years to work full time, so it may have been pricey and i didnt notice."
350z,38vcac,sosyurface,7,Sun Jun 7 18:33:54 2015 UTC,Its the drivers.
350z,38vcac,Mourcore,2,Sun Jun 7 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"Precisely.   Depending on driving skills of such a car, how well the tires stick, he danger is always the operator.  I need new tires...my ass end comes loose after a light rain. The road gets too slick, the car is light, and the power is there. I drive like an old lady after it rains. During great weather, it handles like a gem. However, the car is capable of way more than I am as a driver. Gotta respect it."
350z,38vcac,FistyFist,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yah, and it sucks too that there's tons of kids that get it in their mind and decide they're going to show off and end up wrapping themselves around a tree, giving the Z a bad name and upping the insurance for even the most safe of drivers. But oh well. So be it."
350z,38vcac,FistyFist,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:29:53 2015 UTC,Ts the same reason that wrx insurance is so damn high
350z,38vcac,nathanwl2004,3,Sun Jun 7 17:09:38 2015 UTC,How old are you? What are your previous vehicles?
350z,38vcac,ItsGnar,2,Sun Jun 7 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure on how this is relevant, but I'm 17, and I currently drive a 2003 Toyota 4Runner.   -braces for rant about how I don't need a sports car and I'm going to get myself killed, etc, because I assume that's what the question pertains to. And if I'm wrong, then I'll be surprised-"
350z,38vcac,ExtendedMix,6,Sun Jun 7 05:25:31 2015 UTC,It's pretty relevant. I wouldn't suggest a 350Z as one's first car for sure.
350z,38vcac,ItsGnar,2,Sun Jun 7 05:38:36 2015 UTC,My first car when I was 18 was a dodge 2000 stratus. I nearly killed myself in that car several times because I was either inexperienced or just plain dumb. I really think I would have hurt myself in a z when I was that age.
350z,38vcac,FistyFist,4,Tue Jun 16 14:06:49 2015 UTC,Its pretty irrelevant. A responsible 17 year old driver will be just as safe as a responsible 30 year old driver.
350z,38vcac,DoingMeAndThenYou,3,Sun Jun 7 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm 19 years old and I own a 6 speed Z. (I was 18 when I bought it, and learned how to drive a stick in it.) It's not age that defines responsibility."
350z,38vcac,ExtendedMix,2,Sun Jun 7 20:36:47 2015 UTC,This is exactly true. I've had my Z since a couple weeks of getting my license.

350z,38vcac,TheRamblerJohnson,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:27:03 2015 UTC,"Little late on this reply but it depends totally on the drivers maturity and respect for power. I owned 2 sport bikes, a ninja 250 and a ninja 636 which was way faster than my current 350z so I already respected power since you have to on a Supersport bike that has the same 0-60 as a Porsche 911 at 18 or you'll probably die. Had the z for 3-4 months so far and have put 10k miles on it so far without incident. I drive a lot, oh and I'm still 18"
350z,38vcac,ItsGnar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:30:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely. As long as you can respect the car and take good care of it, there shouldn't be an issue. I've always wanted to own a sport bike. They seem really cool, but I haven't had the chance to ride one yet."
350z,38vcac,ItsGnar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:24:36 2015 UTC,Can confirm. At 20 I have no problem respecting the vehicle. My dad took me to an abandoned parking lot and told me to give it a lot of gas while turning. I spun and completely lost control. (I own the base model without VDC or TCS) I have played forza my entire life but no amount of video games would prepare me for how the car would behave and how to correct a slide. From that day on I have had no issue respecting the raw capabilities of this car and knowing that my skill limit as a driver comes far before the limits of the car.
350z,38vcac,schniederzero,-3,Mon Jun 8 22:21:37 2015 UTC,Good thing it wouldn't be my first car...
350z,38vcac,schniederzero,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"It's not the car. If you stay within 80% of your skill level while driving, in all situations - you should be fine.  It's when you get to sensory overload that poor decisions are made.  The vehicle is only responding to your commands/reactions."
350z,38vcac,cancerousiguana,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:36:22 2015 UTC,I don't know what it is exactly but I'm 17 and daily my 350z and insurance isn't that bad. Definitely not the priciest of all the cars we checked. Good luck man. And actually the reason it has that rep is because it is actually the most crashed car per million produced. Mostly being single car accidents if I remember correctly.

How many hours/days/weeks between each occurrence?    Lets gather as much data as we can on your symptoms before you spend anymore money. See if you can get a friend to video for you when it dies and when you try to restart it.    Also, see about cross-posting this to /r/MechanicAdvice and see if they can help pinpoint your issue.

350z,38k8re,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:55:15 2015 UTC,It only occurs when it wants to. Its hard to say sometime I've been driving for maybe 5min going to school when I'm about 10min and then after school it will turn off going home being off for 8 hours and 5 mins again going home. I wouldn't say I drive aggressive only on weekends and since I've had this problem I drive steady and calm. I now have good video of it turning off but have no idea how to upload it..

Limp mode usually limits the car to about 3000 rpm when driving. But, the tough start up kinda negates that. Another thing to check, if you have an immobilizer, they can cause issues.    Again, cross post this to /r/MechanicAdvice and see if they have any insight on the matter. I'm racking my brain and Googling as much as I can to see if I can help."
350z,38k8re,BlueXTC,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:15:38 2015 UTC,No really big engine mods that can have problems but other then : JWT Pop Charger : Ses CatBack Exhaust : Berk/ Test Pipes not a mod but I did change the Camshaft Sensor and Crankshaft Sensor  How would I change the limb mob or know if its on ?  And I'm sure I do have the immobilizer and yes Ill give my problem over to /r/MechanicAdvice
350z,38k8re,BlueXTC,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"Limp mode could be a number of things and would need a diagnostics test from someone with an OBDII scanner. So you would need to find a mechanic. Test pipes might be part of your problem. Not saying it is but, it should be considered as a possibility."

350z,38fzvq,Getsmkedouthere,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"So to get the obvious out of the way, yes there is a crack in the bumper and a small dent in the hatch. There was apparently a conflict between the rear of it and the end of a railing resulting in the damage. My stepdad is an autobody specialist which is pretty much the only reason I still picked it up with the damage. My father's friend does autobody as well and is great with paint so there's also that.  Now that that's out of the way, I'd like to say how much I absolutely love this car! It's personally the best car I could ever ask for and I've loved every second of driving it (gone through $40+ of gas in the last 3 days including 120 mile trip back home, oops!). The best part about it is that I feel I can be responsible with it and I constantly find myself going under the speed limit because it just feels so much faster for me than it actually is.  Coming from a base 03 Impreza to this was a little hard to handle at first. All of that power, and I haven't even taken it above 3000 RPM.. I drove a 2013 Mustang GT occasionally for the past month to try and get a feel for a RWD car with that much power and I was still surprised when I first drove it. When I got to drive the GT, I was in love, but with the 350 it's just so much different. Maybe it's because it's my car and not someone else's, maybe it's just because it suits me more. Either way, this car is absolutely stunning.  To get to the title, I put ""Enthusiast?"" because I'm honestly not 100% sure what it is. It has cloth seats, no brembos, and stock radio/stereo, so initially I thought base model. However, it also has full steering wheel controls, cruise control, and a VDC button. What would be your guy's consensus on the model? I'm not really bothered either way, I'd just like to know for future reference!  To sum it all up, I guess future plans? I don't plan on anything too crazy. First would be flushing and refilling fluids (after bumper repair obviously). Then probably new head unit, nothing fancy just something simple with an aux input. Small exterior mods to make it more mine and to look nicer, legal tint, probably new wheels seeing as how the ones I have on right now are scuffed up in some places. It has brand new tires and brakes so I won't worry about that for a while, except for winter tires. The tires are no Michelin PSS, but they're brand new so no point in really replacing them as of right now. The rest is a blur for me really, play it by year, maybe suspension>bolt-ons/tune>sound system? Not sure.  That's pretty much all, to anyone that endured it, thank you for reading my post and to anyone in SE Connecticut/Western Mass, maybe I'll see you around sometime! Would love any opinions/feedback/criticism you'd like to throw out.  TL;DR: This car is officially my absolute favorite thing in this world, even with all of the little, maybe moderate faults. I look forward to owning it for a long time."

A few exterior mods to make it personal, tint, detailing, new wheels at some point, bumper repair obviously, new head unit (this and bumper are first). After that, I'm not sure which direction I'm going in. Probably suspension>wheels>bolt-ons+tune>sound system.  Though I do like the look of gold wheels, I think they're a tad tacky.

350z,386j99,Falcon990,0,Tue Jun 2 05:45:26 2015 UTC,Fitment is different i believe. I have an 07 and i remember there being slight differences when looking into getting a carbon hood. You can always get a poly urethane one and get it painted.

Say it with me L-I-F-T,  or in my case faced to far down, adding? You guessed it DRAG. A couple degrees can make or break a cars aerodynamics hence the addition of support/adjustment arms is needed. 4., no shit it's got a little extra height I just got a new set of 20inch motegies put on. New springs & struts or coilovers are the next thing the change jar gets cashed in on. One part at a time, shit gets expensive. (Mommy and daddy don't pay for this toy) 5.,as for price? Yeah, they have gotten cheaper, so where's yours? Awful lot of trash for someone with no wheels to talk. Take your 80's window louver loving verbal defecation elsewhere. 6., rice? Really? Just because of some headlight tint? 7., no excuse for the headlights btw.. tried a new look that went horribly wrong and way darker than expected. So on this yes, my bad. (All other arguments invalid) 8., it'll be hard to see my ride height, rim size, lip type, or headlight tint, when all you see is my non tinted taillights.  9., brings a bigger smile to my face than that keyboard and mt.dew in front of you in your mothers basement ever could. 10., true car enthusiasts NEVER rip on someone else's ride, but instead appreciate the time and energy they put into making it a rolling expression of themselves. Form or function? Domestic or import? Low and slow or jacked up slinging mud? In the end it's all intake, compression, power, exhaust.  a passion millions of people enjoy everyday, spending money we don't have, on parts we don't need, to impress people we don't know.   Soo...

I got my 04 with 180k, motor burned oil through the spark plug recesses, clutch was gone, and the transmission was grinding enough to warrant an upgrade to the CDO09. All in all I've put maybe $2500 into repairs by doing the work myself (and $700 on an emergency cracked radiator repair at a shop). Read the FAQ in the sidebar and make sure you're knowledgeable on each years common problems. High mileage isn't necessarily bad for a Z,  but like any car, that's enough miles such that you'll want to know what might go wrong and check them out.  Ask the owner when/if the clutch was replaced. If it hasn't been replaced you're likely going to be due for one. Test drive it and get up to about 50 mph in 6th and hit the gas hard. If the revs fly up, the clutch is shot, and that's an expensive repair at a shop (or a good bargaining tool if you can do it yourself)"

350z,37u9px,thrwar213,1 point,Sat May 30 13:12:51 2015 UTC,Z mom here as well. The lack of acceleration could very well be your clutch needs replaced. 2 prior owners may have tracked or raced and that wears it down. The rattle could also be rock/gravel in the heat shield (low stance it happens). Cruise could just be a matter of a bad sensor.  (I was an  import repair shop owner and minor repairs mechanic in a prior life)
350z,37u9px,BlueXTC,1 point,Sat May 30 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"Cruise control issues like that are often caused by brake fluid being low(ish).

The only answer for that is because somebody ragged the hell out of that car. It has a check light because of the exhaust, which means it has test pipes, which means it isn't street legal. Shitty rota wheels (they aren't that bad but they are not a selling point). Unknown brand coilovers, probably junk, which probably means the interior rattles crazily. Or they are already worn.  Do yourself a favor and get one closer to stock that has more care and documentation on it."

I know some people report it out lasting that, but 100k in many cases, is a long-lived clutch.   It is a sports car after all. I'd expect a few rough launches here and there, as you'd expect from any performance car.   Having said that, it doesn't detract from your other very valid points. Especially the exhaust."

350z,37e6l4,inquisitive_investor,1 point,Wed May 27 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"What you may do is pose it as a question to the seller: ""What happened to your old exhaust? The setup you have currently isn't street legal and won't pass inspection after my purchase.""  No dealership in the world would knowingly, in good conscious sell you a car with test pipes. Obviously the individual vehicle market is a little different, but it's a strong case for bringing down the price if the seller isn't providing a legal replacement.   At the end of the day, if you can get the price right, it'll make a great car. The mods suggest to me that it was ""used"" moreso maybe than my Z..."
350z,37e6l4,ntran2,1 point,Wed May 27 05:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'm on a budget.     This is why I would be concerned about buying this particular car. If its been run hard most of its life, you could run into some very pricey issues. Two things I can tell you now that will need to be fixed; all the viscous bushings will need to be replaced and the transmission will eventually need to be rebuilt or replaced due to the notoriously weak synchros. I am assuming its been driven hard, so my money is on 2nd and 5th being a little grindy. So, right there, you at $2500 (new parts) into basic higher mileage maintenance for this car. $2500 could buy you an brand new Motordyne exhaust, new cats, a pop charger intake, and a plenum spacer. OR, it could get you a very nice coilover kit for a lower mileage, stock car.    I'm not trying to be an ass to you dude, I just don't want to see anyone get burned on a bad buy. Like it has been mentioned above, it's a sports car, so yeah you can expect to be driven hard but, it also means repairs are going to be more costly and possibly come sooner than you expect."

350z,377kdc,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Tue May 26 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"Superchargers make better power with higher cylinder pressures. So running all higher compression is better, probably a 9.5:1 would be better. That's why most supercharger cams have a longer duration on the intake than the exhaust. I tell most of my customers to keep the stock headers on. You could lose a pound of peak boost just by switching to high flow headers.   My shop built a twin turbo 370Z with a built motor. Bored over .020"" so it's 96mm. We put 10.1:1 pistons in and made 650whp (for now) with just a 255 walbro and 1000cc injectors. Stock rails and no return system."
350z,377kdc,cdipping,1 point,Thu May 28 06:14:48 2015 UTC,"The stock VHR headers are much better than the stock DE headers though right?  I've never heard of someone sticking to the stock DE headers for that reason.  Right now I'm building a revup DE with 8.8 pistons, bored to 96mm.  The plan is to put the boosted performance turbo kit on it.  BP says a set of aftermarket headers is a must with that setup, but as of right now I was just going to run stock cams, what are your thoughts on that setup?"
350z,377kdc,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Thu May 28 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"Turbos since they run on waste energy can use as little restrictions as possible. So doing headers with the Boosted Performance kit would be a good idea. You should make pretty good numbers leaving the stock cams in. If it's a budget thing, I would leave them and do the headers, if you have the extra cash, then now it the time to do them since you'll have the motor apart."
350z,377kdc,cdipping,1 point,Thu May 28 14:03:11 2015 UTC,Definitely 8.5:1. You want to run lower compression ratio if you're going with forced induction. It'll allow you to run a lot more boost on pump gas.

Regular maintenance of vehicle, maintenance of air pressures, and weather (like extreme heat)   That being said, a set of inexpensive tires will last just as long as a set of expensive tires, assuming poor conditions of the previously mentioned categories. However if everything on the vehicle is maintained properly. And disregarding objects in road, or high speed curbing, or similar accidental occurances, if you spend good money on tires, they'll generally last you a good while.   People mentioning rotations are not considering the fact that most 350z's and sports cars in general, have staggered wheels. And are also usually directional.   If you have more questions. Please feel free to ask."

350z,36hdjz,Folcwald,1 point,Wed May 20 17:17:54 2015 UTC,Here is the passenger's side sensor and Here is the driver's side. They both plug in to the rear side of the engine near the top. The driver's side sensor is underneath the air intake so it would probably be easier to get to if you took that off (I haven't done the driver's side yet.) I would have felt ripped off to pay $300.00 even to have both sensors replaced.
350z,36hdjz,LuckJury,1 point,Wed May 20 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"As a few other guys have said, it's probably the camshaft sensor. If you have codes for both camshafts, then its probably the crankshaft sensor. The thing with Nissan and these sensors is they use them to figure out the timing of the motor, now you could have 2 bad sensors (1 cam and 1 crank) and you'll throw a code for the one that is actually good. So I would have it tested before you go swapping sensors."
350z,36ffg3,Boond0ck,5,Mon May 18 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yup that's part of owning a z.

350z,36e0vr,shrewmz,2,Mon May 18 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"In my 03 touring, the ONLY thing that made me feel like it was COMPLETELY disabled was unplugging the power to the ""VDC brain"" (forgot what it was actually called). This disabled all sensors, ABS, VDC, the whole nine yards. PLUS, this system is also meant to cut throttle if the sensors detect sliding or even if the ABS kicks in. Unplugged the brain and got all that throttle back. I took it to the track 2 days in a row, 6 laps per day and my times the second day were 6 seconds faster on the second day (58 seconds vs 52 seconds). Of course your dash will light up like a Christmas tree though...  http://imgur.com/0wK7rfy  (ignore the cruise control and tire pressure sensor, those are actually right)"
350z,36e0vr,coldhotdogs,4,Mon May 18 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"There is a much easier way to do this, that won't affect your ABS.  Right behind the gear shift under the plastic trim there is a small sensor module with a 6 wire connector running into it. You can see it if you lift the plastic shift boot trim, but you'll need to lift the transmission cover trim to reach it. Unplug the connector and the VDC program loses it's yaw and lateral accelerator data so it shuts down w/o hurting ABS. I believe that the orange wire going into the sensor is +12V so adding a switch to that wire might be a good solution."
350z,36e0vr,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Tue May 19 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"I read about disconnecting the yaw sensor but I didn't know it was that easy. Although for track days, I don't want ABS either. What happened to me was there was a hairpin-right at the end of a straightaway and since my suspension is stock, my passenger-side rear tire would come up off the ground just a tad and trigger abs right as I was trying getting back into the throttle, this cutting the fuel intake and just killing any momentum I had :( Having a switch would be beneficial for some though!"
350z,36e0vr,coldhotdogs,1 point,Tue May 19 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was ABS, I think that was VDC's traction-control-failsafe mode. I'm not sure that the ABS software can affect the throttle. I know exactly the behavior that you're talking about. I'm pretty sure that it's the failsafe sensing a combination of rear wheel spin + steering input + throttle.  In any case, find a repeatable test case you can drive through and see how blinding the VDC changes the car's behavior. I've tracked my Z without ABS and didn't really enjoy the experience. On the whole it's fine but when traction conditions change you have to be really on the spot with pumping the pedal."
350z,36e0vr,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Wed May 20 01:41:11 2015 UTC,"That could be. I think I liked it most because it took everything else out of the picture and got back to the basics. Just me and the machine. No fancy schmancy stuff haha, I had a blast. So cutting the yaw sensor wire and putting in a switch would effectively give me the ability to leave VDC off all the time? I hate having to turn it off every time I turn the engine off and back on again, it's just anything to remember especially between laps. And unfortunately, they shut down the track I went to last year and have since bought a Kawasaki Ninja 636. So the Z hasn't got much attention yet this year :("
350z,36e0vr,coldhotdogs,1 point,Wed May 20 03:09:22 2015 UTC,"VDC kicks in when I drive hard enough on the street haha. I feel it was put in keep people from crashing these things so much but as someone who has driven almost exclusively rear wheel drive cars, it really feels like a nanny safety.    I really wish they just kept the earlier model TCS so I didn't need to deal with Yaw. If you just press your VDC button, it only eliminates your traction control, but your yaw sensors will still interfere. What this translates too is a little bit of wheel spin and your okay, but get a little sideways and the car will fight back.   I just pull the ABS/VDC fuse by the battery when I hit the track. No ABS but I'm comfortable with it. Otherwise you will need to look up some tutorials about how to disable everything and keep ABS"
350z,36e0vr,thetimechaser,1 point,Mon May 18 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"IIRC from my 350Z ownership, the way to fully disable VDC was to turn it off with the button, and then do a donut/spin, which would then shut the system off fully, as indicated by the constantly illuminated SLIP (or spin?) light.  I'm sure if you ask around an SCCA or NASA forum you'll find folks racing the 350Z that can give you a more elegant solution for fully defeating VDC without spins or without the loss of the the ABS from pulling the fuse."
350z,36e0vr,240ZED,1 point,Mon May 18 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is bullshit that you need to do something like that to eliminate the systems.   While what you describe has been discussed and does turn off the system, its more of a computer fail safe then built in functionality from Nissan. Basically it's like ""Oh, the wheels keep spinning in this messed up way and we can't compensate, better throw the driver a warning light and shut down the system"".   So lame."

350z,36e0vr,christoc,1 point,Tue May 19 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it does. In my '04 I have VDC but not TCS. Even with the VDC off if you have some driving skills you'll sense the VDC during trail braking and during early acceleration before the apex. This drove me crazy until I developed enough sensitivity to it. I was never able to trail brake consistently, and even downhill off camber braking was inconsistent at times.  Even when the VDC is ""off"" it will watch for some combination of rear wheel speed differences and steering and brake input. Then it triggers a sort of failsafe using the ABS, you can feel it via the brake pedal. That makes trail braking into a corner very difficult to do consistently. It also attempts to augment the LSD by applying braking to one of the rear wheels when you're accelerating out of a corner.  You can unplug the harness on the side of the ABS pump or remove it's fuse but to kill VDC but that clearly kills ABS which isn't a great idea unless you have some skills.  There is a yaw & acceleration sensor near the gear shift, it is mounted just under the transmission tunnel plastic skin.

Then there's the biggest issue of me still having the same shitty headlights from when I bought it. Some guy bought these high temperature bluish-purple bulbs that are basically candles and I can't see shit at night, but haven't really taken the time to replace them because the bulbs are kind of expensive."

It is two parts, one brush cleans the battery terminal, the other brush is for the inside of the connector. Corrosion prevents a good connection, so get rid of it. If you still have charging problems after getting rid of the visible corrosion, there could be corrosion inside the battery cables under the insulation. Or you might need an alternator."

350z,35u5jy,kowaa,5,Wed May 13 15:12:38 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. But it only happens once every blue moon. Usually it's because I've been pushing the clutch/transmission kinda hard and it just needs a little cooldown and it's fine. I don't know if yours is lasting for a while though?
350z,35u5jy,daudnighthawk,2,Wed May 13 16:18:27 2015 UTC,This would happen to me when I first got my Z and was readjusting to manual transmission after not having one for several years. It doesn't happen anymore now that I don't hold the clutch in for as long. I'm pretty sure it happens when the clutch overheats.
350z,35u5jy,FujiwaraTofu,1 point,Wed May 13 20:21:32 2015 UTC,Same here. Changed the fluid and it's even rarer now.

350z,35u5jy,danutz777,2,Wed May 13 19:42:30 2015 UTC,If you change the slave change the master and add a steel braided line. Runs about $300 where I live.

Best bet is to buy the Z1 Centric Slave delete, it reverts it back to the 03-06 mechanical clutch fork, which to me gives WAY better pedal feel."
350z,35u5jy,XSPLL,2,Fri May 15 22:43:05 2015 UTC,This is an intermittent issue on my 05 as well.  Only seems to happen on really hot days while driving in traffic though.  Haven't tried swapping out the fluid for something better yet.

350z,35u5jy,Gecko_2007,1 point,Wed May 13 16:35:13 2015 UTC,"could be an air bubble in the slave cylinder, similar to what mine felt like. I was gearing up to pull everything apart, bleed the cylinder and replace all the fluid, but it turns out I just sat in the car (cold, not running) and pumped the clutch (hard - VERY hard) and I managed to force it out.  To be fair, I don't drive a Z, so I'm not sure if this will work for you, but it's better to try this first than spending the money on new clutch fluid if you don't have to."

350z,35u5jy,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Wed May 13 15:22:43 2015 UTC,I'm confused.  Is clutch fluid the same as transmission fluid?  I had a Nissan service guy tell me that.
350z,35u5jy,LandlockedPirate,2,Wed May 13 16:36:52 2015 UTC,No. Very no. So much no it isn't funny. Clutch fluid is a hydraulic oil in principle its the same as your brake fluid or power steering fluid.  The transmission is filled with lubricating oil which in principle is like the engine's and differential.  In the 350Z the brake and clutch fluids are interchangeable although most people invest in higher temp brake fluid which would be wasted in the clutch system.
350z,35u5jy,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Wed May 13 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"higher temp brake fluid which would be wasted in the clutch system   If it weren't for the fact that the short line runs ~4"" from the cat I would agree with you, but I run the good stuff in my clutch system for this reason.  Necessary?  maybe not, but not unfounded either."
350z,35u5jy,MiddyMcPinnerson,1 point,Wed May 13 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I run high temp in my clutch system as well. But since I track the car it's just a little added insurance. For a street car I don't know what you'd do boil the clutch fluid, I don't think that I've even seen it on track.  Now power steering fluid: that I've seen boil at a trackday but that was a Z32 TT. It gets really hot in the Z33 but I don't think that it's close to boiling."

350z,35vi74,ledBASEDpaint,1 point,Thu May 14 14:42:05 2015 UTC,I meant the actual honeycomb structure not the actual 02 sensors. The structure itself had detached from the inside wall and was rattling and sliding forwards and backwards. The 02 sensors were fine. Totally new car with new cats on it.

This is assuming you are going to finance. The sooner the car is paid off, the more money you can put towards mods. Also, cars that don't have notes attached to them are far better looking that any sound system or powder coated wheels. Paying off the car also give you time to appreciate it in it's completely stock form. When you finally mod it, you really notice the difference."

Rims belong in the fast and the furious. Wheels go on your car.    If I have a grand to drop on aesthetics/sound, I'd go with sound. Get a decent head unit (I just pulled a crappy JVC nav unit out of mine) and replace the front speakers. Then get a nice 4 channel amp to power the front speakers and a sub. The rear speakers and their placement make them worthless and not really worth spending the money on. You should be able to do that for less than a grand. There isn't much you can do the the body/wheels for a grand or less and it not look ricey. This is just my opinion but, I wouldn't put anything ""cheap"" or from fleabay on my car. It takes away from the look and usually doesn't last. I think the cheapest mod I have done was vinyl wrap the B pillar covers due to the previous owner ruining them with cheap carbon fiber stick on covers.    Either way, its your car. Do what makes you happy."

350z,35t1xa,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Fri May 15 11:51:36 2015 UTC,"I want to believe that Nissan just put them there to give the car a more premium feel. But, the stock ones are too quiet to actually do anything. Seriously, fade you radio to the two back speakers and turn it up. I've heard cellphones that get louder and have better clarity than those two speakers. Putting aftermarket ones back there will give you a louder system but, you'll find it just doesn't sound good. It gets muddy quickly, which is only exacerbated by a subwoofer. And that is mainly because they sit behind your seat in a thin plastic surround. Dynamat may help but, it wont be much. IMO, the best thing you can do for that car is a good set of components for the doors, with their own amp, and a sub with a mono channel amp."
350z,35t1xa,N4TYB0Y,1 point,Fri May 15 12:04:38 2015 UTC,i just tested the back speakers and your right im going to put in an aftermarket headunit and sub. I might put 2 6x9s in the back (in their own box) and just disconnect the 2 rear speakers as they are complete crap. Are the stock component speakers good because most aftermarket ones only have 1.5 inch tweeters where the hole is 1 inch.

Definitively upgrade the audio, since the factory system is junk. Dont bother with the rear speakers, they'll never sound good no matter what you put in there just because of where they are.

350z,35qum5,ItsGnar,6,Tue May 12 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb; never buy a vehicle that has been modified. Without a doubt, this will usually mean that the car has had the snot beat out of it on several occasions. The little engine upgrades are not that big of a deal but, with lowering springs you tend to run into bad shocks and a creaky interior. On top of all that, you are trading up in mileage. 45,000 more miles is a lot of driving. And, depending on your annual mileage, 45,000 miles could last you several more years in the 350z and leave you with a nice used car that can be re-sold for a decent price. 45,000 more miles on that subie and it wont be worth very much. In my opinion, you would be getting the short end of the stick. I would look for something with similar mileage, even if it costs a bit more."
350z,35qum5,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Tue May 12 20:31:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I'll keep that in mind but something about the STI just makes me want it. I'll take your advice into consideration before I pull the trigger on it though.
350z,35qum5,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Tue May 12 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I can totally see the appeal of a WRX or STI. The thought of a turbo AWD car tempts me very much. I'm not against (not that my opinion really matters, I'm just a dude on the internet) you getting a WRX but, I think you would be wiser to trade for one with lower mileage. Or at least, mileage equal to what you already have. One other thing to keep in mind; high mileage cars break. Period. They could be made of adamantium and something would still break. When it comes to a performance car, breaks can get very expensive, very quickly. So consider the mileage the WRX has, research common issues, and take a look at your income. If you can afford to fix the subie when it breaks, then get the subie.    One example; I recently bought my 350z. I bought a 2004. My year model is known for weak synchros and after 100k miles, bushing going out. I knew this going in and I know I can afford to fix those issues. Had I not known that, it could have been an unpleasant surprise when those issues occur."

The 5 speed tranny stopped shifting into 1st, 3rd and 5th, so the dealership replaced it.  Unfortunately, the manual transmissions for the Excel came in both a 4 speed and a 5 speed version, with the 5 speed just having an extra set of gears in a box on the side that meshed with 3rd gear.  When the dealership replaced the tranny, they put in a 4 speed. When I drove it off the lot after the repair, it seemed to have a little more pep, so I got it out on the highway, got going about 45 MPH and went to shift into 5th and it went into 3rd. The engine started screaming, so I backed off and took it right back to the dealership."
350z,35rt5l,cdipping,1 point,Wed May 13 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"Just so I can sound semi intelligent when I talk to the dealer, is it possible they could have somehow messed up the shift linkage? Would that explain some of my issues?"
350z,35rt5l,ntran2,2,Wed May 13 02:28:03 2015 UTC,They misaligned the reverse lockout. There's a plate that sits on top on the shifter that holds the shifter down. This plate is the reason why you have to push down to get into reverse. The holes are oval shaped to allow for adjustment. It's a easy fix that will take about 30 min. I've done this a few times myself but I check it before I release the car to the customer.
350z,35rt5l,Do_it_in_a_Datsun,1 point,Fri May 15 01:27:44 2015 UTC,Bring it back asap. The dealer is responsible for this. If it is not settled with them you might need to consult some legal advice.
350z,35rt5l,Alphanova1,1 point,Wed May 13 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"Swapping the clutch shouldn't prevent you going into gear unless they dug deeper than what was needed. They should have just dropped the transmission, replaced the clutch, and put the transmission back in place. If the 5th gear synchro is bad, you may need a minor rebuild, or just replace it with a newer transmission.     Keep in mind the brass synchros on this year car can get damaged easily with sloppy, hard shifting. Is it possible you may have been burning 5th on a regular basis?"

350z,35mlqk,thetimechaser,8,Mon May 11 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, just had to submit this because I see a lot of poor fitment cars popping up on here. To top it off, almost NO INFORMATION is given ever.   Specs 18x10.5 +15 all around  235/40 Front 234/45 Rear   Fine tune: 15mm spacer front, -5.5 camber, 30mm spacer rear, -1 camber. Rolled with an Eastwood roller.   Rear shot: http://i.imgur.com/eK5vWdA.jpg   Also, before antistance nerds get in here and comment about how nonfunctional my set up is, get told son:  http://i.imgur.com/1SAthEq.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/ml8gITh.jpg  I only scrub a little front fender at full lock on banked corners, 45mph plus.   There is no reason to run a rim narrower then a 10 in any instance on a Z imo. Those ""packages"" that they sell on ebay with staggered wheel widths are waaay beneath the capacity of what a Z can fit and look undersized. Basically, you should always seek wheels that are 10 inches or wider, in an offset of +20 or lower. Anything else is just undersized for the chassis, plain and simple.   Narrower widths for autoX and lapping dudes in the front is okay, as long as you can get a 245/55 on it for monster front grip. But in terms of ""fitment"" they do not apply, function is the goal there, not looking good.   I get many do not like my type of fitment, even though I think my current set up is more conservative for the ""drift"" style of tuning, I've run way more ridiculous set ups. That being said, don't post about ""fitment"" if your running something close to stock size on lowering springs. It is not useful.   Also, just use this website: http://www.willtheyfit.com/   If you can't figure it out with willtheyfit, then just pay someone else to do it right for you.   Thx! :P"

350z,35mlqk,ItsGnar,1 point,Mon May 11 19:45:19 2015 UTC,What suspension mods do you have done? Your fitment is identical to what I want when I get new wheels and they also happen to be the same wheel I want.
350z,35mlqk,ItsGnar,2,Mon May 11 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"PBM Pro coils, SPL Front upper camber arms, Tein tie rods w/spacers, Circuit Sports rear toe arms, SPC rear camber arms.   If you don't care about fine tuning your camber really all you really need are some decent full coilovers (true type, none of that spring perch rear BS) and some rear toe arms to keep it straight. Natural camber IIRC on a drop as low as mine is about -3.5.   You also do not need near as much front spacer as I do unless you want to run a ton of camber too.   For the record, my alignment sucks dick for grip driving. Too much front camber to brake effectively. Car's a dream sideways though."
350z,35mlqk,absurdparadox,1 point,Mon May 11 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. What are some good coilovers you would recommend. Your fitment is basically goals for me.
350z,35mlqk,absurdparadox,2,Mon May 11 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"No worries. I hate when people try to keep their set ups secret, everyone is going to find out eventually anyway.   Stay away from super low end coils like Megan, ISIS, BC, D2, blah blah blah clones. When these blow you are basically outta luck.   I prefer the next teir up, Stance, PBM, Fortune Auto. These are arguably the same quailty as their cheaper counter parts, but if anything breaks you can get new shocks, top hats, collars, whatever, and fix them for a fraction of the cost of a new set. Plus I'm just a huge PBM fanboi. Their customer services is tits, I really jive with their whole, ""lower the piss out of the car then drive it well anyway"" attitude.    Anything more expensive like Ohlins, Zeal, HKS, other baller crap is generally unnecessary unless you are a hardcore road racer. These are also prohibitively expensive to buy and service."

Basically we need room up front for complete lock to lock transitions without rubbing (keeping in mind we have more steering angle with mods). Also, a tire too wide up front will slow down your transitions between slides. I run small tires out back is just because I have no power mods, they fit pretty, and they are $70 a piece so its cost affective for shreddin'.

350z,35j3x8,iWriteCodez,5,Sun May 10 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"There are tons of automatic cars out there that have been heavily modified.  I've owned manual and automatic sports cars and just because it's automatic, doesn't mean it's going to be terrible and not worth it to upgrade the performance.  There are plenty of upgrade kits for the Z's auto trans that will speed up the shifts (transgo shift kit) or if you have the money, you could get your tranny built for some serious power.    The sky is the limit with your car.  Don't shy away from upgrading your car just because of the transmission."

After college, I should be making decent money (not trying to be cocky), I'm going for Software Engineering, so after some time working, buying a new 370z may be in reach."
350z,35j3x8,bmillions,3,Mon May 11 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"On the Z's and G's, I have seen quite a few tranny swaps and to be honest, it is a whole lot less painful to just trade for a manual Z.  It will be a lot cleaner this way and the re sale value will be there if you decide to sell it in the future.    The 370's are nice and I have driven quite a few.  So much potential with that car.  My advice would be to get a 1-3 year old 370Z and let someone else take the depreciation hit on the car."

350z,35j3x8,RushNY,1 point,Mon May 11 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"Modding it with a manual swap maybe.  But seriously: yes, if you plan on keeping it. Most mods (as in, any upgrade that's not OEM), value-wise, are going to at best break even and at worst devalue the car when it comes time to sell it, due to the fact that people have varying tastes when it comes to modifying their cars. This goes for manual or auto. Whenever you put money into mods, just assume you're not getting it back ever. So the only measure of ""worth it"" is if you think the happiness it will bring you is worth the cost of the mods."

350z,35fw1q,u3h,2,Sun May 10 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"And honestly this sounds more like there's air in the system rather than brake fade. You might be experiencing some brake fade, but the fact you say this problem still occurs after you let it cool leads me to believe you have some pockets of air trapped in the system."
350z,35fw1q,TreeFiddyZ,2,Sun May 10 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"I will go with this answer. Also that brake pads will feel different when they're near end of life, not that I'm suggesting yours are at that state. I think that as the pads are wearing thing you can put enough heat into them to change their chemistry or something.  Ducting is difficult if you're using the factory front fascia. One strategy with the factory front end is to use a wide shop vac nozzle mounted somewhere like the inboard of the front of the wheel well (where you won't see it when looking at the car) and run ducting to right below the caliper where the rotor draws air in. That is the only solution I've seen for the rear of the car.   Also get rid of the dust shields behind the brake rotors on both axles. AFAIK their only purpose is to help keep water from splashing up onto the rotors. I've purposefully barreled into ridiculously deep water and never managed to get the rotors wet, so I don't see the shields doing anything useful. If you're creative you can leave a small piece of the dust shield in place to hold the ducting.    When you get off track and the brakes feel like this take some slow speed laps of the pits or somewhere to keep airflow up. And make sure that your rotors are properly clean when you put the pads in so that they bed evenly. The black spots from improper bedding will act like insulation and the rotor temps will be uneven, causing cracks."

350z,3572q3,ttgspeed,1 point,Thu May 7 18:45:41 2015 UTC,I think you can press the new bearing into the old seal.. Assuming you have a press
350z,3572q3,kim_jongill,1 point,Thu May 7 17:46:18 2015 UTC,Rear bearing seal? Are you talking about the rear main seal? Its a metal piece and requires a new seal to be seated in the middle. To correctly do this swap you need to remove the lower and upper oil pan.

350z,3544cp,anphrax,2,Wed May 6 23:17:59 2015 UTC,They have a huge aftermarket which is great. It all really depends on what your goal is if you're going to mod it. If you're going to the track if focus on suspension and NA parts. Gutting a lot if it helps. If you'll primarily drive it on the street you can easily toss in a supercharger. Either way they're great cars. I sold mine with over 100k still running like a champ. Debating now on a used z06 or 370z with forced induction of some kind.   Overall I'd say you can go wrong with a Z.

Like he said, there is plenty aftermarket for this car. It's good on gas, if you stay off it, and it's got so much power for a car of its price. If you go with any, look for an 07 or 08. They have the VQ35HR. A bit more horses and the fine details are better, wheels and headlights and all."

350z,354vrf,DeanGulberry6591,1 point,Thu May 7 03:25:41 2015 UTC,It should be around 1.5 inches but just want to go back to stock alignment will this do it?
350z,354vrf,DeanGulberry6591,1 point,Thu May 7 03:27:25 2015 UTC,It all depends. Its really up to your tires. Once you drop it. It makes the tires toe to start leaning. I don't have a drop yet but I watched a friend of mine ruin two sets of tires with his. He eventually went to a tire shop and had them align the wheels and check the toe on them. After he put the camber arms on it ran a lot easier on the tires

350z,350mpa,niftytyler12311,3,Wed May 6 02:55:42 2015 UTC,Orange one looks good but then when you read it says the car has been put through 200k miles. But rebuilt and the new engine now already has 80k? That's a ridiculous amount of driving for a sports coupe. So just watch out. It may look clean but you never know. That's just my 2 cents.
350z,350mpa,Fideh,2,Wed May 6 03:43:00 2015 UTC,"i would agree, there are way too many ""new"" items on the 05 one. and why would an engine that is designed to run at least 200k with proper maint need a rebuild 80k miles before it hit the milestone?  that sounds pretty off to me"
350z,350mpa,osborn1201,3,Wed May 6 04:55:02 2015 UTC,"The only red flag I'm seeing with the ""orange"" one is that 1) the owner doesn't know the color is Leman's Sunset. And 2) no where does it mention the trim (unless I missed it).   Finally, ""I'm selling my personal vehicle""...? Like no duh, what else is it, someone else's car?   At the end of the day, the mileage and ""rebuilt motor"" kinda scare me, and don't justify it as a $7K car. I suspect that he won't be able to get rid of it for less than $5K, if you're patient.   Edit: I went back and re-read the ad again. Either the guy isn't that great with English or he's trying to ""load"" his ad. Changing parts ""because I want the best"" isn't really a good reason, and doesn't justify a sustained value.   I can't really understand why he needed to replace the seats in the car. Did he spill too many drinks on them?  Also, why did the engine need to be rebuilt anyway? How's the clutch doing while you're at it. I know the red Z wasn't the best ad, but that one comes across as more knowledge to me about the car.   On the red car, ask if the tire pressure sensors were transferred from the stock tires when he swapped them out. That's a problem I deal with as my last owner did not and I'm constantly reminded with a flashing ""PSI"" light.   Edit 2: know that the ""Fairlady"" Z is the Japanese production version. You might ask how he got ahold of it since it wouldn't have been sold in the US and would have had to have been imported, which may make the vehicles past much more shaky. I'd recommend a Carfax check on it, but even then, and if the car spent some years in Japan, there's no telling how it was treated. Could tie closely in with milage and engine."

(Hatch back)  for the most part I didn't care about being beat around the track, it was just fun to open her up WOT and not have to check my rear view mirror for cherries. I see it as a legal way of having fun and don't care about being the fastest guy on the track. You should bring your Mazda down its a blast."

350z,34xuvo,kingpoiuy,3,Tue May 5 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"might be a slight upgrade to 06+ oem from your 03? if you don't want brembos, another option would be akebono bbk"
350z,34xuvo,osborn1201,1 point,Tue May 5 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I want them, just can't afford them ;)  Thanks for the input. I wasn't sure about what was involved with doing a swap with an 06 - need to research that more yet.   I'll look up the bbk and akebono. I was surprised that none of my general searches have come up with those companies as an option. Summitracing only gives me Cardone and Centric options."
350z,34xuvo,TreeFiddyZ,2,Tue May 5 13:53:55 2015 UTC,Places like ConceptZ sell the Akebono calipers from the 370Z as a kit with the appropriate adapter bracket.
350z,34xuvo,osborn1201,1 point,Tue May 5 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"you can find 06+ oem easily and cheap. akebono will probably be about the same cost as the oem brembo if you can find a decent used deal.   either way you will have to cut up or replace your dust shield to appropriate size for them to fit, the akebono setup or any other bbk setup would require brackets that usually come with the complete kit. the 06+ oem should bolt right on once the shield is cut"
350z,34xuvo,TreeFiddyZ,2,Tue May 5 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"If you upgrade the backs then you need to upgrade the fronts accordingly. The ""rear brakes only do 25% of the work"" mantra is deceptive. Yes, they only do a fraction of what the fronts do in terms of stopping you. However the TCS and VDC and ABS are designed to make higher use of the back brakes via a bias mechanism. They do this so that in a panic braking situation you will be more likely to understeer than to oversteer. So if you upgrade only the rear calipers then the car will behave poorly in low traction conditions.   EDIT: Oh, and check the cost of getting it rebuilt versus just buying a new caliper. I paid about $500 to have both rears rebuilt, could've bought a new pair for a little bit less. D'OH!"
350z,34xuvo,osborn1201,1 point,Tue May 5 13:57:52 2015 UTC,yea rebuilding usually isn't worth it unless you have some fancy expensive calipers. getting a used set of 06+ oem can be even cheaper for a slightly better performance.
350z,34xuvo,ngoncalves92,1 point,Tue May 5 14:22:01 2015 UTC,I'm a little new to 350z so this may not be the best advice. A lot of the wrx people will buy used brembo calipers from the sti people who would further upgrade their calipers and sell their brembos on the forums. Maybe grand touring or track edition Z's do something similar so you'll be able to find them at a more reasonable price.

I know nismos usually have a serial badge on the center console. Other than that the body looks to be in good condition. I don't know how much that is in US dollars but I wouldn't go over 10k for it.

At the time of the purchase, I was concerned the clutch may be headed towards the end of its life and got the priced marked down.  You may choose to investigate similar aspects here as well. How's the clutch doing? Why is there so much aftermarket aesthetic work? Was in a fender-bender? When were the tires last replaced? Was the appropriate belt work done at/ around 60K miles?   Just food for thought.  /edit: just realized you weren't OP... disregard the tone of this message as if it were directed at you."

350z,34rewk,MasterRuckus,2,Sun May 3 22:27:56 2015 UTC,I forgot the specifics but redline has a good clutch fluid available. I would also suggest changing out the clutch line to match your brakes as well.   Your power steering fluid might be old too so that might be something you want to change.   Royal purple is good if you track your car. If you just daily it then other synthetic oils will be okay.
350z,34rewk,Rawrsh,1 point,Sun May 3 22:40:02 2015 UTC,Thank you i knew i was forgetting a fluid. I probably need to change the power steering and i forgot ti mention i did grab a stainless steel clutch line. The local scca group puts on an auto-x day once a month until it starts to get cold. So ill probably end up doing royal purple.
350z,34rewk,Rawrsh,2,Sun May 3 23:10:25 2015 UTC,Just curious since you track your car. Did you swap out your open diff already?
350z,34rewk,cdipping,1 point,Sun May 3 23:31:36 2015 UTC,I havent had a chance to swap it out yet I saw a g35 in a junk yard that i was thinking of pulling the diff and welding it old school way

350z,34rewk,TreeFiddyZ,2,Fri May 8 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of Amsoil's products, plus I like being able to get everything from one order. Their transmission oil has a longer lifespan and works smoother in my car than the Redline.

350z,34rewk,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Sun May 3 23:36:06 2015 UTC,Do you buy direct from amsoil? And my shifts feel nitchy now so buying it used you never know how well it was taken care of. Probably the factory fluids

350z,34rewk,zswickliffe,1 point,Tue May 5 00:27:33 2015 UTC,What fluids exactly do you use for diff and tranny?
350z,34rewk,MDK350,2,Wed May 6 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"Basically whats on their product selector, for the diff I use their regular diff 75 90 and for the manual transmission I use (gl4 75 90)[http://www.amsoil.com/shop/by-product/transmission-fluid/manual/manual-transmission-and-transaxle-gear-lube-75w-90/?code=MTGQT-EA]. I replace the diff oil every 3 years and the tranny every 2. The CD009 transmission shifts much better with the Amsoil in it than every did with OEM fluid, I don't think that they oem stuff holds up at high temps from track days."
350z,34rewk,zswickliffe,2,Wed May 6 10:39:23 2015 UTC,-Engine: Rotella T6  -Trans and diff: OEM - can't stress this enough.   -brakes and clutch: ATE Type 200
350z,34rewk,MDK350,1 point,Mon May 4 03:33:55 2015 UTC,Serious question: why OEM?
350z,34rewk,zswickliffe,1 point,Mon May 4 06:45:50 2015 UTC,"For the transmission - the synchros are very sensitive from what I understand and switching to other fluids has caused grinding and what not.   For the diff - I used redline when I did mine a year ago or so and it hasn't performed as well as OEM used to.   Besides, you do realize that the OEM spends years and umpteen amounts of money developing a package that works well together, why mess that up?"
350z,34rewk,MDK350,1 point,Mon May 4 10:16:30 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same regarding the trans fluid, so I've always used OEM and havent had a problem.  I havent heard anything about the diff needing anything special, other than it has to be the right spec (GL5 I think? look this up.) Theres no syncros to worry about in the diff, its just a gearset. The viscous LSD is a seperate sealed unit that has its own fluid."
350z,34rewk,zswickliffe,1 point,Mon May 4 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"Correct, no need to use OEM for diff. I just noticed decreased performance when I went with recommended weight Redline fluid.   I think it's because Nissan's OEM diff fluid is actually wayyyy heavier than the recommended weight in the service manual. Not sure why, but it is. And it works better accordingly."
350z,34rewk,MDK350,1 point,Mon May 4 16:39:55 2015 UTC,"So, what did you notice? More noise?"
350z,34rewk,unthused,1 point,Mon May 4 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"In the diff? It doesn't seem to be ""locking"" as well as before. I can feel the inside wheel slipping more than the outside."
350z,34rewk,unthused,1 point,Mon May 4 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"Right, the part that controls the ""locking"" has its own fluid, and is sealed from the rest of the diff. When you change the fluid all you're changing is the gear oil."
350z,34rewk,Rowel81,1 point,Mon May 4 18:16:10 2015 UTC,I don't think this is correct. I have disassembled one before and there is not a separate compartment for the fluid.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2bRb17jJ1U
350z,34rewk,Rowel81,1 point,Mon May 4 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Did you pull apart an open diff maybe?  I'm pretty sure the inner part which does all of the work is a seperate, sealed, non-serviceable unit: Part #38760  It sits inside of the ring gear and wouldnt really even be in the fluid that you change in the diff, since the fill plug is below the axle.  I'm planning on switching to a Wavetrac this summer so then i'll be able to confirm for sure."

I purchased my 04 6mt touring for $10k with less than 90k miles on it. Do some research, see which model suits your needs best and start your search from there. Never settle my friend, good quality cars are out there. You just have to look."
350z,34lgjt,slvr2k10,4,Sat May 2 05:32:24 2015 UTC,"No do not buy the 05.   Don't buy that 08 either, it's def been in an frontal accident. 06+ Owners will never trade down to 03-05 headlights. Plus that engine bay is pretty dirty, those filters are gross. With that sign of neglect I can only imagine how well the owner paid attention to the car.  This is going to be your first car? Well it's not going to be fun because you're buying it at high mileage and will need to drop around $3000 just for basic maintenance. This is not to scare you but to prep you. If 10k is our of your budget then I suggest staying away and drive something like a Miata, MR-S, EP3 Si, RSX, etc. Those are much cheaper to maintain and are easy platform to do it yourself.   Plus get a manual, the  Auto Z is not as much fun as the manual. The Auto 3rd gear is so tall it just feels lack luster getting it up to speed."

It's definitely out there and with the budget of $9k, I'm sure you can find something worth while. It took me over 4 months to find it so take your time."

350z,34heeo,schmerk_a_beewl,1 point,Fri May 1 19:45:09 2015 UTC,The headlights were actually purchased off someone that did the LED work.  They were '06 headlights that I retrofitted on the '05 and the painted black + the red LED was a bonus!

350z,34heeo,Replode,2,Sat May 2 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the work is expensive but not necessarily difficult. You can find a lot of DIY stuff on z forums for the headlights. I took my '05 headlights apart and painted them black (you lose the high beams) and it really wasn't a tough job!   As far as recommendations, what are you looking to get out of the z? It does take a lot of money to get real performance (more than it comes with) out of the VQ but it can be done, just depends on what your end result is."

If it gets louder when turning left then it's the right wheel bearing, and so on. But to me if one wheel bearing goes on a car that's 5+ years old I'd just as soon replace both.  If the diff busing is torn then you'll wind up killing one or both rear wheel bearings."
350z,34fx3o,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's the differential bushings.   Also, car doesn't vibrate or anything. I haven't really turned at higher speeds but even at lower speeds while turning, the sound doesn't get any louder.   Here is a video of it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyehmYtSpTI"
350z,34fx3o,Bosticles,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"Check for leaks maybe?  I think a dry diff may make this noise, but it doubt it would last very long if it were that dry.   The weird part is that it really is a hum.  Wheels or drive train would be slow pulsing and getting faster as you go.  Even at 60 you can almost make out each pulse (I can make out my unbalanced wheels making pulsing sounds at 60ish). I'd check your exhaust for leaks or maybe something loose vibrating.  That's all I can think of."
350z,34fx3o,ntran2,1 point,Fri May 1 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"It sounds constant. So it definitely is your wheel bearing. It's more likely the first sign, as it's only going bad at higher speed.   To ensure it is also not your Diff, look at the diff and see if there is any black fluid on it. A burst diff bushing will have black fluid all over it."
350z,34fx3o,ntran2,1 point,Fri May 1 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you guys! My new wheels are coming in today because this set is totally off spec (they even put 30mm spacer on it to even sit somewhat flush) so when I jack up the car, I'll take a look at it.   EDIT: Could the stupidly thick spacers cause it to malfunction? I also noticed, with that big ass of a spacer, the stock studs are used. I'm almost certain it's not the extended studs... which is worrying..."
350z,34cxph,ExtendedMix,2,Thu Apr 30 03:34:27 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd like to say I'm still running my stock paint, so I collected this information from other friends and such.  Paint jobs can vary so much, it's hard to say.   I've heard people say that their paint job cost as low as $1,000-1,500 USD for standard paint jobs. Now as for the more expensive paint jobs, such as two tones, or anything similar to that characteristic, I've heard $5,000-8,000 USD.   Honestly, you can spend as much or as little as you want on a paint job. It completely depends on what you want. Hope this helps."
350z,34cxph,tajonny07,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:53:44 2015 UTC,"Ya I definitely wouldn't trust a $1000 paint job. Maybe for a winter beater for fun, but not with my Z. Some family friends of mine own a very reputable paint shop in my area and I know they charge ~ $5,000 for a full car, but they do a A++ job. Apparently how well the car turns out will mostly depend on the amount of time spent prepping the car."

350z,34cxph,stakoverflo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:57:08 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter it's going to cost around the same for any color. Painting a car isn't like painting a wall where you can just slap some primer on it and go.

350z,347xpm,u3h,2,Wed Apr 29 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"It's relatively easy but could probably be intimidating if you don't know what you're doing or haven't done something like it before. You have to take out the whole center panel out to start with and once you get everything hooked up, there's not that much room back there for all the cables. I ended up pushing a lot of cabling underneath the heater unit.   As /u/n_keohane12 mentioned, so long as you are able to crimp and strip a wire, you should be able to get your head around it.  Some things to note: I thought the headunit came with satnav & android mirrorlink built in, so I bought it thinking it was a real bargain. Turns out you need additional adapters (for example) to get these features and I opted not to go for the additional stuff in the end (plus I'm not sure it would fit amongst the rest of the cabling back there). However, it hasn't had an impact on me, as I tend to use my phone for satnav and hook it up via bluetooth for music anyway.  Not sure whether you're interested in rear view camera but some info: I originally put a standalone camera on the car, but found it looked pretty terrible, so I found the below and replaced it:  Rear Camera  The hole on the above doesn't quite fit the light for the number plate, so you may need a small knife to cut a little bit away.  I also needed this kit, since my car is pre-'06, to retain my steering wheel controls:  Steering pack and facia  And these are just some instructions which I think I referenced a bit:  Steering Control Adapter 29–674  Here are a few snaps I took this evening, you can customize the theme and change the colours of all the lights etc. I have mine set up in orange for obvious reasons: https://imgur.com/a/whTqz  Apologies for all the links being in GBP! I know this is long, but it's just some info I wish I had before I started so hopefully it's not too boring! Good Luck!"

350z,346isa,MiddyMcPinnerson,2,Tue Apr 28 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"First of all your tires are out of spec for stock tires. They need a 45 aspect ratio not 40. You only go to 40 when you step up to 245-265 in the front and 265-285 in the rear.   The stock front wheels give the Z a back spacing of 132mm. (Calculate this by having 8"" times 25.4mm to get 203.1mm; Now find the wheel's even split [divide by 2] and you will find 102mm. Add the positive 30mm offset and you're at 132mm backspace, voila!)   So when you added the 25mm spacer, it became a 107mm backspace.(Subtract 25 from 132) So we translate that into the 8.5"" wide wheel you have a zero offset (the halfway point) of 108mm. So a 18x8.5"" wheel at zero offset will give you the similar backspacing as your current wheels with spacers. Given that they do not have a Zero offset the 15 is the best you can get at the 8.5"" wheel.   Plug the same formula to find the rears.   TL:DR - Stock wheels are too narrow for this car. Get 9.5 +22 for the front with 245/40, then 10.5 +22 for the rear with 275/40. Since you already have the wrong tire size it would be a good plan to go with the wider setup.  EDIT: Yes all aftermarket wheels need new hub centric rings. Without it you're straining the bolts and they may sheer off."

That red Z looks nice assuming he didn't roll back the kms. Maybe they're just way cheaper in Michigan, but that's REALLY low mileage for $13k imo.  I just bought my 03 Touring with 35k miles for $14.5k, so I guess it's somewhat comparable."
350z,3430qw,Boond0ck,2,Mon Apr 27 23:16:09 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you mean roll back the miles and if you are is there anyway to tell?
350z,3430qw,Boond0ck,3,Mon Apr 27 23:21:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm Canadian so used to saying kms lol. There really isn't as far as I know since you can apparently replace the whole gauge cluster in one shot, but chances are it's not. When you check the CarProof/CarFax, if you see a pattern of the kms going up with frequent increments, then your golden. But if theres a 6+ year gap where the kms/miles were never recorded, and only went up slightly (say 10k miles in 6 years) or something like that, I would be questioning it."

350z,3430qw,iPlaya,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:03:07 2015 UTC,"The Z I bought a few months ago had about 43,000 miles on it, and I paid $14,000.  But it was kept stock.  Also, I had it up on a lift and picked the underside apart.  Not a single sign of leaking fluid, or hasty cleanup.  Just be careful."

350z,3430qw,DoubleTappp,2,Tue Apr 28 09:26:27 2015 UTC,"Don't get it, I bought mine with lambo doors, it was cool at first but then the hydraulics started to break and it was a bitch to align the door right to just shut it. Trying to shut it from the inside was the biggest bitch, it took me 5 mins just to shut the door. Also the interior started to rip apart because the door panels  will rub against stuff, the exterior had some bad dings on the doors from the previous owner, I guessed he got fed up with the doors not shutting right that he kneed the door in to place. There were big dents on both doors. The side fenders have cracks from the door rubbing on them. While driving and taking a turn  one of the doors just flew open and started to fall and scrap on the street. I almost crashed cause of it. The door was all broken, I replaced both doors after that because I had it with them. Spent over 2 grand to get them replaced but now the windows don't work because of a cord, another 500 right there. Honestly it's cool at first but in the long run its not, they are soo much of a hassle and also it looks kinda ricey"
350z,3430qw,relited,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:12:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply from actual experience. I never would have thought that the doors would be misaligned or would be faulty. Tbh from what you and everyone else have been saying I think I'm just going to go stock

350z,342ws1,gottahobby,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:20:45 2015 UTC,I was thinking that. I don't want to get a 275 and it be stretched onto the rim but I don't want to get a 285 and end up messing my fenders up rolling them.

If not, it may have the same oil issue as the 03-04 (which is relatively easy to fix btw, just did it on my 04)  Not 100% sure when they made the switch to the CDO09 transmission (the good one), I know it was 05 but not sure if it was beginning or mid-year. When you drive it, be sure to shift it hard, especially into 3rd and 5th, and feel if it grinds. I had the CDO01 tranny in mine and it grinded pretty bad into 5th.

350z,33jh4u,thegreyz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"The seals for the spark plug recesses in the valve covers goes bad. It's easy to tell by pulling the coil out and seeing if there's oil in there (I had oil in 3/6 cylinders) the gaskets are pressed in so you have to replace the whole valve covers, ended up costing a bit but not too complicated a fix, especially considering I was replacing the knock sensor anyway, so I had everything out of the way already."
350z,33jh4u,cancerousiguana,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:09:54 2015 UTC,"Ahhh,  this just fixes the spark plug leaking issue.   Not the major oil consumption that could occur on the 03-04s with higher milage."

Not very often but I've seen posts on my350z forums about them. If it seems pretty responsive and not for a loss of power while driving it should be okay. Other than that, oil burning is pretty common on just about all year models. Buddy has an 06 and his burns like crazy. Mines an 07 and holds oil like a champ. No make or break worries as far as I'm concerned on the 05. How much are they asking for it ?"

Also, just because peak hp/tq is higher,  does not mean its making more power.  Its all about the power curve. Also my350z is horrible about miss information and should only be used to by/sell parts.. the pop charger looses power because of this: it drawes hot air from the engine bay, increasing ait's, while maintaining stock pipe diameter. Combine those two and you will never see any true gains. And the heat shield they make is absolute garabe. The only short rams I have personally seen gain power are the CIN's, that utilizes 3in intake pipe diameter. (Also those gains where with an open hood and fan directly pointed at filters)."

Unless the intake is the frontmost piece of the car or sitting a couple of feet above the car (like Formula 1) you aren't getting ram air. You're getting whatever is left over after the bow shock, and you get no benefit from the scoop versus a normal intake.  I've seen one 350Z where the owner actually integrated that scoop into the bumper, put filler around it and sanded it until it looked like it was cast in. I have to say that it looked good and complemented the other things he'd done to it. But a scoop that's clearly stuffed in and held by pop rivets or tape looks like hammered crap."

For a 03-04.5 DE the only mods you need to make power is Test Pipes, Y pipe (I like the XYZ Pipe) and 5/16 plenum spacers. - 245rwhp roughly with a tune ($1900 with all premium parts)  05-06 REVUP needs test pipes, Y pipe (I like XYZ Pipe), 5/16 plenum spacer and MREV lower plenum. - 250rwhp roughly with a tune ($2300 with all premium parts)  HR - Test pipes and tune will net you 265rwhp. ($1200 with premium parts)  As for the hole in the bumper, no it does not make more power. You're MAF sensor adjust to the airflow so therefore you're not going to be sitting in power city because theres tons of air. It will just make your filter dirtier, faster. So yes the bolt on capabilities of the VQ is a crap shoot, you will spend more than 3k to never even break 300rwhp.

350z,33d7ie,TreeFiddyZ,3,Tue Apr 21 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"If you can tolerate the idle chatter from the light flywheel then JWT is a great solution for cars without crazy horsepower mods. The light flywheel makes the car far more fun to drive hard, although it does require a bit of finesse when not driving hard. The engine RPMs drop so quickly that you have to keep a little gas in while shifting."
350z,33d7ie,ntran2,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"Quite Contrary imo. The faster rpm drop made shifting such a dream and precise. Before I would shift and the rpm kind of bogged or had to catch up. Now it's blip city, blip blip city."
350z,33d7ie,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:58:34 2015 UTC,Thats true on an open road. But I find that in traffic behind an econobox whose driver thinks that reaching the speed limit about the time they reach the next traffic light is ok... having to short shift and then not accelerate afterwards takes a bit more concentration.

Beyond those I would say that it's similar to buying any other used special purpose vehicle: give the car a thorough inspection to look for signs of heavy use or abuse. Are there any weird scrapes on the underside which indicate it might have gone over a curb or something, stuff like that.  Personally I would avoid the 2006 models due to their possibility of oil burning and oil pressure issues."

350z,338jez,hexagonation,2,Mon Apr 20 14:34:49 2015 UTC,Inspect all of the bushings. Replace the plastic under engine tray with the aluminum one from Z Speed.
350z,338jez,TreeFiddyZ,2,Tue Apr 21 13:39:02 2015 UTC,Can you recommend a guide for checking the bushings? I have inspected for anything catastrophic in the well but knowing exactly what problems to look for will be a big help
350z,338jez,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:34:40 2015 UTC,Mostly it's obvious signs of wear. The main bushing that ties the back of the differential into the subframe tears and fluid leaks out. You can feel around for tears on both sides of it. The inner end of the lower control arms on the front axle have a busing that sits in the middle of the mounting bolt. The control arm often slides off of the bushing.
350z,338jez,bmueller91,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:35:21 2015 UTC,I'm confused as to why a stripped lug bolt led you to buy new rotors?
350z,338jez,bmueller91,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:41:22 2015 UTC,Both the nut and the threaded bolt (extension from the rotor) are stripped. There would be no way to reattach the wheel
350z,338jez,That_Yak,2,Mon Apr 20 14:51:44 2015 UTC,The lugs arnt attatched to the rotor. The rotors slide over them
350z,338jez,That_Yak,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"So I will need to replace the lug on that part, sounds like a simpler solution. The current rotors are old though and won't survive that long on the harder brakes I'm installing"

With TX World Speedway closing I'm going to add Motorsports Ranch Houston, or Harris Hill Road, or Eagles Canyon, or Hallet into the rotation instead. Living in Texas does have some advantages: namely 6 or 7 tracks within a 5 hour drive.   There are about 10 Z's that regularly show up at track days in the area, an epic 240Z and a mix of Z32, Z33, and Z34's. Plus a couple of GT-Rs and the occasional 240SX. I've seen one race prepped 510 at a track day... OMFG I want that car.  And going to ZCCA conventions has given me the opportunity to do track days at Willow Springs and New Hampshire Motor Speedway."

They only come in 17s which I love because not many z33s are on that size, cheap as hell, and pretty durable for reps. But they are pretty heavy, and its hard to find good used race tires for the size I need. Also because they are 17s, my car sits lower than I'd like. http://www.latemodelrestoration.com/products/94-04-Mustang-03-Cobra-Wheels"
350z,32xuok,LandlockedPirate,2,Fri Apr 17 16:45:36 2015 UTC,You do autocross and you have 235s up front? is that a typo?
350z,32xuok,MDK350,2,Fri Apr 17 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"No?  I'm not what I would consider serious about autocross.  I go 3-4 times a year just to thrash the car around and have fun, I could care less about competing.  Also note that this is a G coupe not a Z, I thought they were the same though.  I know my way around the engine/suspension but I have to be honest I'm a total newb when it comes to tires/wheels.  What should I be running up front?"
350z,32xuok,MDK350,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"With that kind of power, you should be running as wide of a tire as you can on all 4 corners. The Z and the G are basically the same (G is 6"" longer and a bit heavier), and I run 275's front 295 rear without rubbing on my Z.   If you went down to 18"", you'd get access to a lot of nice auto-x tires, like the Hankook RS3, Dunlop ZII Star-spec, BFG Rival, Bridgestone RE11A, etc. All of these tires are on a whole different level than tires you're looking at for being grippy. The Pilot SuperSport is probably the closest to these.   That being said, all of these would be terrible for street use, so if you only have one set of wheels you'll probably want something a little more tame. I use the V12s myself on the street. They're a nice balance of being cheap, quiet, and ok in the rain, but they arent very good as autocross tires. So, if you have to have just 1 set and want them to do it all, the Michelins might be worth the extra cash."
350z,32xuok,MDK350,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"This car isn't my daily so I wouldn't be totally against autocross tires, but at the same time it does spend a lot more time on the street than it does doing autocross so I think it would be wiser to stay with street tires."
350z,32xuok,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:22:46 2015 UTC,Either way it wont hurt to go wider up front if you can.
350z,32xuok,JiGsAw818,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"What /u/MDK350 said.   18's are infinitely better for track use (autocross maybe not so much but still, 18's are better). 19's can easily be bent if you put a wheel off track. And as far as I can tell there are way too few tire choices on 19's.  Find a reasonably priced set of 18's and keep them for track use.   I've run Michelin Pilot Sports before (on 18"" rims) and was very unimpressed so I kind of ignore their product line now. Especially when I melted them and made the tread blocks move slightly.   So based on the list of tires you've provided I would get some Yokohama AD08R's and a set of 18""s for autox only. ;-) Short of that I'd probably go with the Pilot Super Sports if I wasn't biased against the brand."
350z,32xuok,schniederzero,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"You tires are off, it needs to be 245 in the front. Having driven on PSS, I would always recommend it. It actually has a huge amount of grip and i believe is well worth the price.  Hankook and Bridgestones just don't last long enough and they lose their grip long before they need to be replaced."

Anyways 275/295 are what I'd do on those track V2 width. You need atleast a 10.5"" in the rear to run the 305 (to not rub and bulge).  To me a 275 rear is plenty traction for the street. On the track I'd run a 275/275 square setup."

350z,32r6e0,ntran2,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:51:43 2015 UTC,Dunlop's tire size and specs page says 255 is the widest. However they are liable to wear quickly due to the car's recommended camber settings: the tires will wear along the inside edge. So an alignment shop that will align the car to the situation instead of simply to the factory specs will help.

350z,32n73r,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:17:19 2015 UTC,The Stillen Series 2 fits perfectly. The only issue was adding an extra hole along the bottom to fasten the wheel well liner to the fascia. And I suppose you could say that adding the ZSpeed aluminum undershroud was necessary to reduce vibration/movement at high speed. But I think that is true no matter what fascia you have so I don't count it against the Stillen.

Full StopTech is also excellent but it's pricey, their prices for both axles are almost the same.  StopTech is second to none in terms of performance and quality.  This article was done before the 370Z + Akebonos came out but otherwise it's a great example of 350Z StopTech options. The temp is the real metric to look for, stopping distances are meaningless.

350z,32gxpt,thetimechaser,2,Mon Apr 13 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"My recommendation for order of operations when modding a car regardless of motorsport preference.    Tires, good tires.  Suspension. Coilovers if your going to be messing around a lot with height, some shock/spring combos out there will do just fine for the occasional lapping day though.  Brakes Moar suspension. Adjustable arms to dial in a more aggressive alignment. Drivers set up. Seat / wheel. Get everything where you need it to be to be properly set up. I personally hated the factory seating position in the Z. (And I had fucking leather seats -_- ) Drive-train. Your clutch will shit the bed eventually, probably after you've done the above though unless you bought one right before service. Also good to plop in a properly aggressive 2 way diff.  Power. Add it how you like, bolt ons, tune, turbo, whatever floats your boat.    The point is, learn your car first, find the limits, push them. THEN add the power. You will become a much batter driver then the jackass who bolts on some Greddy twins with his ebay lowering springs who shows up and puffs his chest at your local meets."

Only 36k miles on it definitely garage kept for most of its life. I wasn't a huge fan of the orange leather in the photos, but I think it looks a lot better in person.

They stack up to Pilots in most categories, and beat them in wet breaking, which is a big concern.  Also, a set of 4 will run about $350 cheaper than pilots."

I couldn't find one in that color that wasn't riced out, automatic and or high mileage when I bought mine =[ Looks so good.  Creeping your post history you made a thread saying you had $20K to spend on a car, what made you go with an '03?"
350z,325qeb,TrollHouseCookie,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"I went with the 03 because it was all the things you mentioned... low mileage, manual, not riced out, and not one of my deal breaker colors (red or silver). I'd been looking for one since January and most of the good ones were going within 24-48 hours. A couple weeks ago, I literally had a salesman take the keys out of my hand and say the one I was about to make a deal on had been sold. That particular one was an 06 with 60k miles. This one ended up working out for me and I was happy to save about $6k on my $20k budget."
350z,325qeb,Piugpoo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"$14k? Damn! Where do you live, if you don't mind me asking?  I bought my '03 with about 50K on it for $12K two years ago. Obviously not as low mileage as yours, but I also didn't even haggle or anything because I have no idea how and am bad at that shit.  I'm guessing FL based solely off the nice looking weather and the green font of the license plate?"
350z,325qeb,Boond0ck,2,Fri Apr 10 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am in Central FL. The low price actually shocked me. (The 06 I mentioned was listed at $14.5k.) I was very apprehensive when I went to look at it initially, I thought it was going to be rusted or drive like shit. I took my friend's husband with me, he's my resident car expert. He checked the wheels and under the hood and after he drove it he was like ""this car is pretty much amazing and if you don't buy it, I'm going to"".  I didn't haggle either, it was listed at $14k and I knew that was a great price and that there would be someone right behind me waiting to snatch it up if I didn't."
350z,325qeb,relited,2,Fri Apr 10 21:21:02 2015 UTC,I think the point he was trying to make is that $14k is actually pretty expensive for an '03. Even with the low miles.

350z,31xr8f,alohroh,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:05:31 2015 UTC,I'd go hfc. A catalytic converter is very important for air quality. There is a reason they are required on all cars now a days. It's only a bit more for a hfc and you will also pass emissions and not throw codes in most cases
350z,31xr8f,ILLkokopelli,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:56:27 2015 UTC,The codes thing is largely dependent upon the car. Some 350Z's throw codes even with steel wool and/or extenders.

350z,31rvth,ntran2,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:40:10 2015 UTC,I'm starting to believe that the radiator fan motors have worn themselves out. This would cause a higher amperage and potentially blow the relay. I also think the overheating from bad fans would cause a sensor or two to malfunction.

I'd be game to meet up somewhere and roll out there, or if your into crusing we could try a route from  http://www.sundaymorningrides.com Either or would be sweet! That snow we got was awesome. First time she was taken out in actual snow and not that devilish ice we usually get. I have to say the car really did a remarkable job handling in it. The TC in that car is really incredible. Glad you got to enjoy it too."

350z,31jgk5,daudnighthawk,2,Sun Apr 5 18:05:27 2015 UTC,I had a similiar issue and the result was an engine vacuum leak.  http://www.aa1car.com/library/2005/us80530.htm
350z,31jgk5,FerCrerker,2,Sun Apr 5 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"Having the exact same problem. I just replaced my knock sensor (which requires removing the intake manifold) and valve covers. My research narrowed it down to this (I think I had both of these problems)   NATS (Nissan anti theft system) it seems like it ""forgot"" my key and kept cutting fuel to the engine. Eventually got to the point of not even starting (starter would crank, but no start). Try removing the key, locking and unlocking the car and try it again. I eventually got it to start and my car seemed to figure it out and now it's starting every time, but not really running right. Which leads to the other problem I think is happening: Vacuum leak. I didn't realize my gasket set didn't include the throttle body gasket so I just reused the old one until I can get a new one. Also I may have forgotten 2 bolts that attach the plenum to the manifold. So next step for me is to take the plenum off,  replace those bolts, and put in all new gaskets (again). If that solves my problem, I'll let you know."
350z,31jgk5,cancerousiguana,2,Sun Apr 5 19:25:58 2015 UTC,Try resetting the  throttle body idle learning process.
350z,31jgk5,ntran2,2,Sun Apr 5 20:35:19 2015 UTC,Check your cam sensors.  See if there is a code not registering on the dash.  Had to replace both of mine.
350z,31jgk5,BlueXTC,2,Sun Apr 5 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"Cam sensors. Had the same problem on a different car. It was fine so long as I was moving, but it died at stop lights. I'd let the car sit for 20 minutes and it would start again. Or I could push start it."
350z,31jgk5,mredding,2,Mon Apr 6 13:37:22 2015 UTC,My problem similar to this was that my car would turn over and sputter out. Took out and cleaned the mass airflow sensor which limped me to the parts store to buy a new one

There are several posts molded into the back of it which are pressed through holes in the silver surround panel and then glued. So you could in theory pry it off, but you'll probably damage the silver panel, causing more problems.   Get some plastic trim removal tools and dismantle the back properly so you can press the Z out of the panel from behind. Note that the new one uses double sided tape, so it doesn't have any posts."

350z,31bgj0,ItsGnar,2,Fri Apr 3 15:31:46 2015 UTC,Most straight exhausts have the exhaust running straight to the tip like this  https://thekevinchen.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/tumblr_lusd1th5ad1r4oqb4o1_1280.jpg  I'd imagine a good shop would charge maybe $300.

350z,315icn,doscomputer,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"I bought this and only had it for 14 hours. As I was pushing it a little I tried to put it into third but the clutch pedal was stuck and the car wouldn't go in third. I pulled over and powershifted home. So now the clutch pedal comes up and down but barely when the car is turned on. Also it only sometimes allows the shifter to go into gear, and when it does and I release the clutch a loud grinding type noise is heard, similar to a gear grind. I'm hoping it's the slave and master cylinders"
350z,315icn,zswickliffe,2,Thu Apr 2 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it's a slave cylinder. Replace the slave and master, easy job. Maybe an hour + bleed time."
350z,315icn,TreeFiddyZ,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:56:12 2015 UTC,If it's the slave cylinder then you might as well replace the master while you're in there. It's dead simple and you already have to bleed the system. Get the Wilwood master cylinder. Off the top of my head I don't know if there's an equivalent slave cylinder.
350z,315icn,TheLostDoge,2,Fri Apr 3 02:08:20 2015 UTC,At least OP has a DE. Slave and master should both be easy to replace.

350z,315icn,fall0ut,2,Thu Apr 2 23:46:47 2015 UTC,I didn't notice a difference because when my clutch was going out I parked my car over the summer and rode my bike. In the fall limped the car to the shop for the clutch and flywheel change.   I think it is worth paying extra for the OEM part and not have to listen to the flywheel.
350z,315icn,TheLostDoge,2,Fri Apr 3 00:16:39 2015 UTC,Not really. The JWT flywheel will last longer and enable you to shift quicker. If you're replacing a clutch with aftermarket parts there's no legitimate reason not to replace the flywheel as well. The chatter will happen on any aftermarket flywheel and on any car.
350z,315icn,fall0ut,2,Fri Apr 3 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying don't replace the flywheel. I am saying to replace it with an OEM flywheel because the extra chatter from an aftermarket is not worth shifting quicker, especially for a daily driver."

The 150lbs come from revisions in the body, panels, underpinnings since 2003.   There is no difference in going for a HR because you're saving what, tenths of seconds on your quarter for all that money? Save $15k-20k, put in a LS2 with a t56 trans, retune the suspension and you can blow by any HR-Z you want.   Of course that is a exaggeration if you want to spend all that money. My deal is, don't focus too much on such small numbers and the WHAT IFs. Get to the track and build your skill set first.   The fastest guy at the last Z day meet I was at was in a gutted out 2003, with a DE engine plus test pipes and plenum spacers, everything else was stock. The HR and turbo guys were the one trying to catch up to him. At this point you're worrying about peanuts."
350z,3116qz,ntran2,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  I do agree that I should build my skill set first. Do you know how much is 'slightly' more if you were to put an estimate on it? 50lbs? 75lbs?  This is for road courses, and 25whp means much more in a 2minute lap.  Weight also is a factor, since I plan to gut the car, if it is only 50more pounds(?) I rather take that with the extra whp.  The tracks I visit has many uphills, so the extra power is helpful."
350z,3116qz,ntran2,2,Wed Apr 1 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"Weight and power definitely mean a lot but the power delivery is also a huge factor too. The older DE have a flat torque plane, the rev up have a torque curve that made for easier daily driving with a peakier mid end. The HR is a refined version of the revup. I don't really like to compare skills without actually knowing what youre used to but I judge you are a track familiar person. So you're going to need to be revving out the hr but you'll have the grunt to do so from the stronger hr block. The REVUP will feel like itll run out of steam at the higher revs (the plenum design) and the chunky mid torque feels like it has more power but if you drop too low you end up having to catch up again to build the power.  The engine is roughly 25lbs heavier if that. The HR weight gain was probably due to the engineers trying to dampen the car a bit, added larger shocks, newer material in the cabin, redesigned console, etc."
350z,3116qz,ntran2,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"This is the exact type of answer I have been looking for.  I appreciate the well informed response!! I am very familiar with track driving(I instruct at HPDE events) but I am fairly new with the 350z.  I bought the revup without knowing the benefits of the HR. Your description of the revup is spot on, when it revs high, the car almost feels like it lost most of the torque. If all that is different is 25lbs I would rather change to HR.  Since all the larger shocks, cabin material and redesigned console will be taken out anyway..."
350z,310mjc,iANDR0ID,3,Wed Apr 1 04:31:28 2015 UTC,A OEM bumper will be a great start.
350z,310mjc,ntran2,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:51:38 2015 UTC,Why so? I'm assuming for the air flow to get in?
350z,310mjc,iPlaya,3,Mon Apr 13 16:45:47 2015 UTC,Tires. The answer is always tires. They're the foundation that all performance modifications are built on.
350z,310mjc,TheStig827,2,Thu Apr 2 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Is it the anniversary trim? Do you have the revup motor (7000rpm redline, only in certain models for 2005, all MT models for 2006) or the regular DE motor (6600rpm redline)?"
350z,310mjc,Quizzie,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:10:11 2015 UTC,6600rpm redline
350z,310mjc,Quizzie,2,Thu Apr 2 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"In that case, I recommend either the MREV2 or 5/16 Plenum Spacer. With the normal DE motor like yours, having both isn't necessary to achieve results. You can do both and squeeze more power out that way, but some say that it no longer becomes as worthwhile when it comes to being cost effective.  You can do exhaust but as far as power goes, you won't be gaining much with an exhaust. Most of the difference will come from the weight reduction if you get a nice lightweight exhaust system.   Your air intake is pretty optimized. If you're looking strictly for performance then don't bother. If you want loudness when you really get on the throttle, I highly recommend the JWT pop charger. As far as sound, its quite loud."
350z,310mjc,RushNY,3,Thu Apr 2 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"I second the spacer, Motordyne to be specific.  Also +1 to JWT Popcharger or Momentum intake as both have good tested and proven reductions in intake temps.  After that save for a supercharger/turbo kit and maybe an exhaust if you want a little rumble."
350z,310mjc,Falcon990,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:23:29 2015 UTC,An exhaust would be my first choice.
350z,310mjc,fairladycesar,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"Exhaust as mentioned, maybe a plenum spacer? Also the K&N drop in filter for your stock intake."
350z,310mjc,BoostedZ33,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"I would start with an exhaust, then maybe some wheels"
350z,310mjc,RhinoTurdz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:57:28 2015 UTC,Motordyne Plenum spacer 5/16 is what gave me the most bang for buck for sure. Then got the motordyne exhaust and ART pipes. didnt notice much in the exhaust except the great sound. Will be tuning next and If im not mistaken thats about all that can be done for a DE without getting into Rebuilding and adding turbos/nos/supercharger I also second Tires.
350z,310mjc,AdmiralPain,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:22:12 2015 UTC,Standard mods for a DE for performance increase:  Plenum spacer HFCs New exhaust Remap  If you want massive gains then the only way you are going to do that is by going FI. All other mods will increase power ever so slightly but then that's just a number. To really notice a difference you need to go FI (turbo or supercharger)  But then we are talking mega bucks

It has a torque dip before it engages the crossover, so you need to rev it out and keep the revs high, though the boxer engine sounds harsh.... much like a VQ!   It handles pretty well in the sense that it is predictable, the Z on the other hand will step the butt out if you're not careful.

However those are not ""On the limit"", they just look really exciting... Also some of the other guys race with 30 to 80 horse power extra (illegal/non homologated) and with sequential gear boxes.

350z,30fuh6,RushNY,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds good to me.  I almost bought a rebuild.  As long as you can insure it, and it's mechanically sound who cares.  Only real drawback is if you wanna sell it later, but I for one plan on keeping mine."
350z,30fejh,DriftIcon,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:38:46 2015 UTC,I agree with this minus removing the sway bay. I find it helps with the removal and install of the pumpkin so you don't have to try to hold the whole thing up to get the bolts started.

Also, be sure to reach up in there and clean all the dirt out of the lip you are about to roll flat, otherwise you will crush the dirt all up in there and end up with uneven bacon fender."
350z,3098bd,thetimechaser,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"This. Heat gun, time, and a proper fender roller. You can do it with a large circumference jack handle or a phone book if you don't give a shit about your fenders. But a proper fender roller will give you much better results.  Another trick is waiting until a nice hot day and leave your car in the sun for a bit before starting. This will help keep the fenders warm in between applications with the heat gun."

If you live somewhere where can temperatures can get below freezing then you should go with no higher than a 5w30.  The brand is highly debatable, but as long as you go with a quality synthetic you should fine.  And check your oil regularly of course.  I've found the difference between the low line and the high line on the dip stick to be about a quart.  Per the owners manual you should get the engine up to operating temperature, park on a level service, and give the oil at least 10 minutes to settle."

350z,2zu6hs,itouchboobs,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:38:47 2015 UTC,Do you not notice the big hole? You shouldn't be able to see into the engine bay from the wheel. With that piece gone you can. Look at the other side then back at the other. It should be pretty obvious where it goes.
350z,2ztvbv,TheArthedain,3,Sat Mar 21 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"The 350z is more similar to the g35 while the g37 is like the 370z. The g37 and 370z are the newer models so they have an upgraded engine. The G35/37 is more of a luxury car. It has back seats while the z has only 2 front seats. All comes down to what your looking for. I would go for the z since it has much less miles and i love the look of it. P.S. pls be manual. P.S.S. jk, u dont have to get manual."

I can already guaranty you need a new centric clutch slave on the G, while you're at it do the clutch and flywheel too. ($1500 in parts plus about $800-1000 in labor).  Also both car will probably need new bushings, the Z due to age and the G due to mileage. But both def need the rear diff bushing replace before it burst and increase wheel hop."

350z,2ztvbv,LandlockedPirate,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:43:11 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Throw some Z springs on the G though for under $100 and then you're even.
350z,2ztvbv,TreeFiddyZ,2,Mon Mar 23 00:54:56 2015 UTC,Really only relevant to the G's without the sport tuned suspension/VLSD option or pre-05.  With that option the body roll is the same as a Z.  It's the suspension that should have been on the car all along.
350z,2ztvbv,I_Like_Spaghetti,-2,Mon Mar 23 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"General facts:   G has more power than Z w/same motor (g35 has more power than 350Z, and same for the 3.7 models) G handles like it's suspension is made of cooked spaghetti. Seriously, the Titanic had less body roll. G has slightly better acceleration due to increased torque and gearbox that's best below 90mph G has better ergonomics for daily driving. More trunk, less noise, etc. G is useless on a twisty road or race track G and Z share many of the same parts, so you can actually wring a lot of performance out of a G, but is it worth it just to have a useful trunk?"

350z,2zmw78,CherryPieStrain,4,Thu Mar 19 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"'04, 184k miles here. If you get an M/T know that the early models had weaker synchros and will likely grind as the miles get up there. I upgraded mine to a newer transmission.  Mine is also burning oil from the spark plug recesses in the valve covers which is fairly expensive due to having to replace the whole valve covers. (Going to run me about $400 and a weekend)  That being said, the motor is still chugging along and the repairs have thus far not too difficult  (tranny swap took me maybe 12 hours altogether, relatively easy.). If you have the mechanical know-how, the 350Z is certainly going to go the distance, but it's still a sports car and it's still going to have repairs here and there to take care of."
350z,2zmw78,cancerousiguana,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"I traded my 04.5 around 190k, and had similar experiences. By ~150k+ the 5th gear syncro was going bad, and 3rd started to go bad around 170k.   I changed the plugs at ~110K after I bought it. There was some traces of carbon towards the back of the intake, but otherwise it was very clean. Never burned oil, never had smoke on startup, etc.  Drivers window motor went out around ~175k.  Had the Nismo suspension on it, never had tire feathering issues (as mentioned, alignment...).  All in all, I was very pleased with the DE motor. In my ~90k miles, all above 100k, I had zero engine issues, other than standard maintenance. I would have had to take care of the transmission at some point, but it's kinda a known issue.   Keep in mind, the late-04/05s had a lot of tweaks to fix the early teething problems, most notably the tire wear issues.  There was talk about the various motors. I bought a 2004.5 specifically to avoid the Rev Up, as I couldn't afford an HR car when I was buying in 2008.  For me, I'd go for HR, then 04.5/05 DE, then 03-04 DE, and finally 06 Rev Up (remember, the 2005 35th Annv 6spd and 2005 Track came with the Rev Up. I don't recall if the 06 automatics were Rev Up, but don't buy an auto) . I'm just not a risk taker, you'll probably get a Rev Up that is fine in reality, but always something to think about."
350z,2zmw78,240ZED,3,Fri Mar 20 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"Im not to knowledgeable on the differences between years myself however, if you go to the right side of this reddit you will see a link that says ""A quick rundown of the 350z differences"" which will explain the major differences between years."

350z,2zmw78,Mr_Outside,3,Thu Mar 19 23:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why people and lumping the '05 model in with the lesser years. When I was researching for my purchase I found that '03 and '04 manuals had some tranny issues but they put a different one in the '05. As far as the '06 I've heard little other than oil burn this, oil burn that. My opinion, if you cant afford an '07 (that was my case), go with an '05."
350z,2zmw78,cancerousiguana,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:49:53 2015 UTC,"The transmission change was mid-2005, so some 05s have the CDO09 and some have previous editions. But I think most have the upgraded tranny. And the anniversary editions of '05 come with the revup engine which has the oil burn issue. So 05 could still have either problem, maybe even both."
350z,2zmw78,Mr_Outside,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"Right, forgot about the '05 anniversary. So a late model '05 non-anniversary might do it."
350z,2zmw78,BjornPaw,2,Fri Mar 20 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"If you can avoid the 03-06 models, do so. If you have to choose from those, try an 04. Known issues are transmission and tire feathering. The feathering issue is completely avoidable by having your car properly aligned. I, myself, have an 03 and haven't had any issues with the trans, even though I drive it hard occasionally. Just make sure you do a 100k mile service on those models as you can't always trust the owner. Change all fluids and have someone check the suspension bushings all around. Under 06 models have a DE engine. 07 and up have HR engines which produce a bit more HP and has twin intakes. An HR Z will be a bit more expensive, but worth it over a DE. All in all, get whatever you'd like, but avoid the 05-06 models."

350z,2zg5yz,relited,2,Wed Mar 18 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend the 05 non revup, it seems to have the least amount of issues out of all the models from 03-08 including oil starvation, clutch slave issues as well as other stuff Z's are known for."

350z,2zfrxi,david350,3,Wed Mar 18 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"Test pipes are basically straight through pipes, no catalyst in them. Motorydyn's ART pipes have resonator chambers to make them sound less raspy, many others sound like crap. And they have great build quality so they tend to be the best choice, but they're also the most expensive. Because there's no catalyst you get the full smell of the exhaust coming out the back of the car, in other words you won't be sitting at a traffic light with the windows down unless you have a nice headwind.  High flow cats have catalyst in them so you get less exhaust smell. Metallic catalyst pipes are the best because they're the most durable. Ceramic catalyst can break. These have less exhaust smell so you can put the windows down in at a stop light.  Test pipes are not technically legal: there's no way that you'll ever pass emissions in most states simply because the ODB2 system will always report a not ready condition from the 2 downstream o2 sensors in the test pipes.   I'm sketchy on this part but I believe that high flow cats may be able to pass emissions because the downstream o2 sensors should produce valid readings. The catalyst should have enough effect for the sensors to read correctly. So an ODB2 based emissions test should pass. Berk's high flow cats are popular.  In either case you should be prepared to deal with emissions failure, which essentially means being able to put OEM cats back on the car for a few weeks. If you do get test pipes or HFCs don't buy the cheapest ones you can find or some unknown ones on ebay. You get what you pay for, and almost everyone that buys the cheap exhaust then has welds crack or the sensor bung tear the pipe open or some other stupid low quality issue."

So no CEL but it won't pass inspection with emissions checks in Not Ready.   EDIT: I don't know what it does with HFCs. My friend who had them always got a CEL even after extension bungs and steel wool. I'm guessing if the extensions or whatever work the checks go into an OK state and you can pass emissions.

The list so far   ACL Main & rod bearings (.001"" undersized) and thrust washers 96mm, 8.8 compression Wiseco Pistons Eagle Rods ARP Main Studs   Still enroute is the OE gasket set, piston ring compressor, lower collector, fuel rails and injectors.  Right now I'm in the process of swapping out valve seals to Viton seals in my heads.  My first VQ build so I welcome feedback or pointers.  Machine shop came back and said .5mm overbore was necassary so that's why I went with the 96mm pistons (stock is 95.5).  I went with undersized bearings because it seems like a lot of people who went with stock oil clearances were spinning bearings, so I'm shooting for .0025 or .003 of oil clearance (stock is .0015).  Next step is to take the pistons to the machine shop so they can do the bore/hone get that just right.  Next they will balance the crank (I'm using the stock crank) for the new rods/pistons etc.  They are also doing the ""HR Mod"" to the block so I can run HR head gaskets.  I haven't decided on head studs yet, I'm torn between dropping the $$ for L19's or just going with HR head bolts for now.  I know I need to go the L19 route when I go FI, but damn it is really hard to spend $400 for 16 BOLTS, especially since I haven't read any stories of HR bolts actually failing."

A huge problem with after market assemblies is their output is not really on par with the factory assemblies.   In place of headlights i suggest Hotchkis Sway Bars :-)
350z,2zamdy,sinn213,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:52:20 2015 UTC,Ill look into the Sway Bars. If i dont end up going with those are there any other things i should be looking into? Im doing wheels and suspension soon enough but dont have money for big ticket items at the moment. Any relatively cheap things i could do for my Z?  edit: trying to keep it around the price of what sway bars should run me anyway. Im thinking $200 - $500 tops for this upgrade.
350z,2zamdy,itouchboobs,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:08:21 2015 UTC,If you still want new headlights I'll buy your current ones if they don't have any cracks or anything like that.

I've done replacement of all fluids (diff, trans, eng oil, brake, and clutch) and checked all bushings and seals. Might want to check the spark plug seals and make sure they're not leaking. These models tend to have leaking seals. Other than that, check the basic stuff out. Ask the lady to see where she keeps the car and check for oil leaks on her driveway. Happy hunting!

Mine was beginning to grind a few gears. Also, it was a super easy transmission job.  Other than that, little things here and there as expected from a high mileage vehicle, but it's still running strong. If you can pick it up cheaper for high miles and know how to work on it, it's a perfectly fine option."

I did a tune-up at the same time since the engine was already apart.   The clutch, brakes and stereo were hit or miss on the '03/04's. I've had all those replaced on mine. I've also had to replace my A/C unit.   I would only expect to get about $7K for mine, and I've got 105K on my '04."
350z,2z4y9z,wrathchld,2,Mon Mar 16 01:10:27 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that an 03 with that many miles and questionable maintenance is going to be beat to shit. 350z's are great cars but not exactly cheap to repair.

The jwl/via to me are ratings to ensure that they do pass a satisfactory point fir daily driving. Because  potholes have bent my advans and ssr but I've seen them destroy rotas and xxr in person. And it doesnt help that most people get these wheels in very aggressive offset and barely have enough tire on there so the stress of daily driving accelerate any structural issues."

I understand that if an volk and a xxr both slide into a curb the volk will bend and the xxr may have a higher chance of cracking.   But if you just need wheels for a daily,  theres nothing wrong with a xxr or rota.   And its also a reality that these cars are depreciating in value.  Theres very little point i  spending 50% of the value of the car on wheels.  There are thousands of pairs of perfectly fine functioning xxrs or rotas for every freak accident.

350z,2yzw3s,ItsGnar,2,Sat Mar 14 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"""Q: What wheel sizes and offsets do I need?  A: Generally speaking, there are a LOT of different combinations that people are running on their Z or G.   Let's get the basics out of the way first: You need a lug pattern of 5x114.3, width between 8 and 11 inches, and diameter of 17"", 18"", 19"", or 20"".   Here are some of the more popular wheel and tire sizes (for good reason) that people put on their Z's. There is no ""RIGHT"" answer but there is a limit to how big or small you can go.   18"" combination:  Front 18"" x 8.5"" , Offset +15 to +25, Tires 245/40/18 Rear 18"" x 9.5"" , Offset +15 to +25, Tires 275/40/18  (lower offset such as +10 in rear is possible but may require rolling)  Front 18"" x 9.5"" , Offset +25 to +30, Tires 255/40/18 Rear 18"" x 10.5"" , Offset +28 to +35, Tires 285/40/18 or 295/35/18 (lower offset such as +23 in the rear is possible but may require rolling)  19"" combination: Front 19"" x 8.5"" , Offset +15 to +25, Tires 245/35/19 Rear 19"" x 9.5"" , Offset +15 to +25, Tires 275/35/19  (lower offset such as +10 in rear is possible but may require rolling)  Front 19"" x 9.5"" , Offset +25 to +30, Tires 255/35/19 or 265/35/19 Rear 19"" x 10.5"" , Offset +23 to +32, Tires 285/35/19 or 295/35/19 (lower offset such as +23 or wider tires in the rear is possible but may require rolling)  From this, you get the idea of what is required to go with smaller wheels like 17's, (typically lighter, faster acceleration), or bigger wheels like 20's (bigger, heavier, usually makes you feel slower).   Get to know how to use the following tools and you will be able to figure out for yourself the correct offsets and tire sizes you need: Tire size calculator (click) Wheel Offset Calculator  Certain combinations of LOW OFFSET and/or WIDE WHEELS will require what is known as ""fender rolling"" or ""fender cutting"".   If you are not familiar with the term ""fender rolling"", here is a quick but useful lesson you can learn in a couple of minutes: Go outside to wherever your Z is parked. Run your fingers along the inside edge of a REAR fender just above your tires. You will feel a sharp edge and a flap of metal sticking inward towards the car. Now, go up to the FRONT fender, and feel the inside of the fender again. You should notice that the flap of metal has been ""rolled"" upwards on the front fenders. This is exactly what fender rolling is all about. The rear fenders will need to be rolled to make room for wide wheels or low offsets, or else your tires may rub on the metal when you take hard corners or hit bumps. Any experienced wheel/tire shop should know how to roll a fender. If you go to a shop that does not seem like they know what they're doing, get out of there.""  I had 19x9.5 +28 w/ 255/35/19 and 19x10.5 +23 w/ 285/35/19 on my 350z, lowered with rear fender slightly rolled. If you have any questions, I'll answer them for ya!"
