Mid_Century,3e4ya3,fast4ward,2,Wed Jul 22 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"You will want to buy a 20 gauge or smaller syringe to inject glue into the crack. Amazon and eBay have them. I fixed a similar issue with water thin cyanoacrylate adhesive (super glue). The water thin viscosity is important to ensure that the glue spreads throughout the crack. You will need to buy this online or a specialty store.  Have your clamps loosely set up around the repair, inject the CA glue, and then quickly tighten the clamps down. Do not tighten as tight as possible as this will force the glue out the crack."
Mid_Century,3e4ya3,and_ampersand_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you remember which brand of super glue you used? Was there a reason you used super glue instead of wood glue? I'd read elsewhere that titebond III (water soluble) showed the greatest strength when bonded to several types of wood, but I'm not sure that the tests included superglue. As a side note, Gorilla glue performed the worst of all glues tested."
Mid_Century,3e4ya3,DocWebster,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:39:55 2015 UTC,Wood glue only works well if you can pry into the delaminated areas to improve penetration. The super glue will wick into the area naturally and increase the glued surface substantially. I just recently tried to reglue a delammed top on a side table with titebond and the moisture in the glue actually caused an area of failure around the original bubble. I pulled off the caul and clamps and little bubbles surrounded the area I glued.
Mid_Century,3e2ngu,Ozioso,5,Tue Jul 21 14:14:36 2015 UTC,"I usually keep my eye out for what is aesthetically and visually pleasing to me, but to find actual designers and brands comes with lots and lots of research. If you look on mid-century modern stores on Instagram, or their websites, you'll learn a lot by seeing some of the same products again and again, or even just once. I read about the designers, their designs, and the companies they are for. Everything stays in my head. It's like I'm a walking catalog! I've trained my eye to stop stuff out driving down the street, in movies, and antique stores. All of it just comes with study and practice I guess."
Mid_Century,3e2ngu,yourmommo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:05:53 2015 UTC,I make occasional trips to Design Within Reach and always pour over their catalogs. I haven't spent much money there but I've learned a ton about which designs are classics and used that as a starting point to dig further.

If you weren't good with the hammer you'd get your dad to do it.  They you'd follow a set pattern to string it. Like from one to 17, then to 22 and back to 2. If you had one nail a little loose the tension would pull the nail out and you had to start over.  They were cool, but after you'd made one or two the excitement was all gone."

Mid_Century,3dvk6x,IgnoreAmos,5,Mon Jul 20 02:04:34 2015 UTC,"So...that is not a Kai Kristiansen chair. At least from what I can tell it is not. And yes, if you google these chairs, EVERYONE says they are....but I've got a little secret.  I got this set about two years ago and at the time I thought they were Kai. 8 Chairs and a matching table for super cheap. I was in heaven.  http://imgur.com/a/xYspv  When I was having the chairs and table redone, they noticed this:   Enhanced  This is the only good photo that was taken so its been a bit of a mystery for me.  Being a bit OCD and wanting to find out, I've done a ton of digging but haven't found a matching stamp online yet.  The stamps second word is Stols (which is danish for chair).  My working theory is that this is a early 50s danish chair made in the style of Hans Wagner, Fritz Hansen and Johanes Hansen possibly at one of their shops but was not part of their official lines.  I can find a small reference here:  http://www.icollector.com/Stols-2-teak-cane-Hans-Wegner_i1230769  And if you look at the legs they are close..but no cigar.   So what are we working with? I don't know. I'm pretty sure the label says Jongs(?) Stols made in denmark but that first word is so hard to see. It didn't even dawn on my that the second word was Stols with the big S incorporated into the first word until enhancing the photo a bit.   So thats it. I'm almost certain these aren't Kai chairs. Stamped Kai chairs have a different mark, different look and I've never seen these specific chairs in his attributed catalog. Maybe they are and just from an earliar time for him.  Or these were made in the workshop by one of the masters or their craftsman who helped design chairs. Either way you have a really special piece that is worth a good chunk of change, is surprisingly comfortable and very mysterious.   The stamp is only underneath the cushion on the chair so I have to undo the upholstery in order to see it and I'm not willing to do that. If anyone else has a similar chair and wants to do that in order to take a look at the stamp, please let me know what they see!"

I am happy to share the products I used, but I do not want this to look like a corporate plug, so I will only provide them upon request.

I work at a furniture consignment shop. There are three of these chairs. There is a branded Wegner mark on the bottom of the chair. Years ago someone reupholstered the chairs in black vinyl.
Mid_Century,3dq9wi,yourmommo,3,Sat Jul 18 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm sure that the mixing of teak and oak is normal, and a classic option, for that chair. I think it is often walnut/oak too. Here is a link from the Danish Design Store stating that the Sawbuck chair was recently re-launched in its dual wood format. Even though it states it is available in oak/walnut and not oak/teak, many Wegner designs that were available in teak in the past no longer are."
Mid_Century,3dqu4h,ALampDesign,3,Sat Jul 18 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"I would say this piece is more rustic/industrial because it shows more design characteristics of that style (thick, dark woods, antique elements like the Edison bulb) than of the Mid-Century Modern style which typically involves a futuristic mindset involving bright colors and a style that is overall less industrial and more minimalistic."

Mid_Century,3djf2e,Yung_Boi,10,Thu Jul 16 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed! A day set aside for a sale/swap that's sticky posted might do.  And if you have any vintage pyrex, I'd love to take a look."

Mid_Century,3di89x,noahfencetaken,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:31 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't get it.  I don't have room.  Nice piece for the money though.
Mid_Century,3dhmg1,Trestar11,3,Thu Jul 16 10:02:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I would pay 50 dollars for that provided you have that to spend. Not a lot of risk at that price. I am sure it is real as it really isn't the type of design people would knock off. I wouldn't buy it to resell it as I think it would be hard to sell and you would likely put more effort in then you would get out in cash. Maybe at some point you could get it reupholstered with a less garish fabric. Could be a nice little side chair.
Mid_Century,3dhmg1,glasgow015,3,Thu Jul 16 13:02:36 2015 UTC,Reupholstering it was certainly on my mind. Not even sure how much that would run if I provided my own fabric
Mid_Century,3dhmg1,glasgow015,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be that bad, provided you go to a cheap place. I tend to look for more commercial upholsterers and provide my own fabric. As opposed to furniture restoration type people. The guy I use smokes in his tiny little shop and mostly does seats for boats and stuff like that but he reupholstered my Eames lounge replica for 90 bucks and did a fine job."
Mid_Century,3dhmg1,yourmommo,3,Thu Jul 16 13:18:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. I'll look into it for sure. Might even ask if my boss knows a good upholsterer. Not around for those kinds of things when I'm in the shop, but I'd imagine he knows some people that would work out a fair price for good work."
Mid_Century,3dhmg1,doublesecretprobatio,3,Thu Jul 16 13:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should buy it. It is a Hannah Morrison Sling chair for Knoll. I'm pretty sure it's authentic because there weren't fakes. That's a good deal. Remember though, if you don't like it, don't buy it for the deal because you're going to end up having to stare at something you hate in your home."

Mid_Century,3dgejm,Cahallfresh,2,Thu Jul 16 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great idea. Metal can be costly, and so can the  fabrication. It will be cool if you could design them or something!"
Mid_Century,3dgejm,TramStopDan,2,Thu Jul 16 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"After looking into the raw material cost plus beer for my friend, it turned out to be easier to order the last ones I needed for a project.   The shipping price does suck.  If you order the ones that aren't finished, add on some cost and time for stripping the oil off and then painting."
Mid_Century,3dgejm,doublesecretprobatio,4,Thu Jul 16 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"because metal fabrication, even simple, isn't cheap.  i own a TIG welder and i'd still be tempted to buy them from someone else.  what you're not considering is the the time + materials needed to set up a fixture for repeating consistent bends and welds."

Mid_Century,3d8pog,doublesecretprobatio,19,Tue Jul 14 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"the right answer is ""whatever you like"".  the wrong answer is ""whatever the internet tells me is right"".  don't get me wrong, i enjoy looking at ""time capsule"" style houses but i personally wouldn't want to limit myself to one design style.  not only does that exclude cool and interesting furniture/decor etc, it crosses the line into kitsch.  if you ask me, going purely ""period correct"" is safe and completely impersonal."
Mid_Century,3d8pog,OnlySlightlyEvil,5,Tue Jul 14 12:34:39 2015 UTC,"Gah, I'm glad other people feel the same way about this as I do. My house is done in my version of MCM. I'm looking forward to posting lots of pictures when it's done, but I'm also a little afraid of it being torn to shreds by the self-righteous MCM purists. ð"
Mid_Century,3d8pog,mullacc,3,Tue Jul 14 18:47:18 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you and I'm going with what my gut tells me and not what is necessarily true to MCM everytime!   However I'm quite new to this world and I've only just realised there was a name for the 'retro' styles I've always gone after. I'm still getting to grips with the designers and lingo used and it can make searching for items difficult when I can see them in my head but can't get them up on the screen.   So any point in the right direction is always welcome :)
Mid_Century,3d8pog,Woolio,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this as well. I really don't like most of the ""atomic"" or kitschy stuff. For a while it seemed like all the midcentury glassware I saw looked like genie lamps. And some of the West German stuff looked like a primitive mess. But I did end up liking a lot of Scandinavian stuff, especially what Freeforms has on their website.   Also, what kind of art goes on the walls?   Sometimes the answer is ""no art."" Especially if you own a Mies van der Rohe house and your walls look like this. Point being, I think the answers are all over the board.   For my one big blank wall, I ended up buying a large format canvas print from MD Canvas. Modern art with modern furniture is a pretty easy fit and the large size means I can fill the wall with one piece. And the frame-less mounting looks clean."
Mid_Century,3d8pog,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Tue Jul 14 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Mies' whole thing was the walls were art.   So... If your walls are art, don't put up art. If your walls aren't art, put up some art."
Mid_Century,3d8pog,TypoKnig,3,Tue Jul 14 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"Other commenters are right, search eBay and Etsy, and even Google images, for mid century art, pottery, and glass, and see what jumps out at you. You'll figure out pretty quickly what you like.   In doing so, I've discovered that I really like Blenko glass, I don't care too much for pottery, and I love mod stuff made out of melamine.   In terms of art, I just recently discovered Charley Harper. But I love, love, LOVE David Weidman.   The important thing is to surround yourself with pieces you love. What good is having a house full of MCM stuff if you don't really like any of it?"
Mid_Century,3d8pog,galacticprincess,3,Tue Jul 14 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Check out some Joan MirÃ² art prints reproductions. Not only beautiful art, but one of the main influences on the free form biomorphic style. Hard to go wrong with a Picasso, Klee, as well as abstract expressionists, and minimal art works well. Zillions more. Not that difficult to find original abstract paintings from the period, by basically unknown artists of very high quality. I have a little collection going. But yeah, go with what you like, a lot of stuff works."
Mid_Century,3d8pog,SwillFish,2,Tue Jul 14 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"To get ideas, go to eBay and Etsy and search ""midcentury modern"" and ""atomic"". I can spend hours drooling over those....:)"
Mid_Century,3d8pog,Moominsean,3,Tue Jul 14 15:58:13 2015 UTC,Etsy is a much better source than eBay. eBay does have nice things but they tend to go for a lot more once they get bid up in auction.
Mid_Century,3d8pog,darktrain,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"Just depends on what you are into. I buy what I like to look at. I have a thing for some of the ""big eye"" artists. I particularly like Igor Pantuhoff and have four originals. If you avoid Keane, you can find very affordable (under $200) originals by artists like Nelly Dax, Etienne Roth and Daude. I also have a few random vintage landscapes. Lots of things fit with MCM. I have a painting of a canyon in South America from the 1920s that looks great with my furniture. Really, buy what you like, don't buy what matches the color of your couch. As for accessories, my wife is more into the smalls. Pyrex always looks cool. Glassware by Georges Briard, etc. can be affordable and decent looking. A lot of people like those tall Viking glass vases. Vintage clocks and radios make good decoration as well."

Mid_Century,3d2vuk,psrivats,2,Mon Jul 13 02:19:58 2015 UTC,Magnificent! I love it and I want it.
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,Philodendritic,2,Mon Jul 13 04:27:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for your kind words.
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,bthebard,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:18 2015 UTC,Stunning! Not overloaded with too many pieces or stuff that clashes. Love the minimalism.
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,yourmommo,2,Mon Jul 13 04:48:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I tend to think a LOT before deciding to buy something, and I usually space out purchases as well. If you don't have the 'buy because it's a good price' way of thinking, it's easy to avoid over stuffing a space. I used to chase scores, but not any more."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,yourmommo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"I love the finely curated selection of pieces and how they go so well together! I am also on the continuous search for understanding my space and the emotional tie to it. Once every few days I move around my furniture and less often I get new stuff. My living space is like a never-ending moving cycle, but I like it that way. Also I love love love the Paul McCobb chairs; I've always admired them."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,SpaceRiot,3,Mon Jul 13 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Paul McCobb did fantastic work, esp for someone without a design background. I was a little apprehensive whether the chairs would work with that dining table, but I was very happy when I saw them together.   You should post a photo of your space, I'd love to take a look."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,F-That,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"If you'd like to see my space, I have some pics I posted previously; feel free to check them out on my account! I'm actually getting my place painted tomorrow, so after its painted and stuff is up on the walls I'll create an album. And yes, McCobb is fantastic. I love the way he made contemporary furniture with classic woodworking techniques. I've seen a few McCobb pieces in my area, but i haven't but the bullet on any yet."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,F-That,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, very inspiring."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,F-That,2,Mon Jul 13 07:29:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you. There are lots of place on the internet now to discuss MCM, but thoughts on how to curate are not easy to find. I am no expert myself .. the main motivation I have is not to buy the same things over and over. (example .. couches/coffee tables. I'm still looking for items that speak to me)."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,SARASA05,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what I love more. The Poul Henningsen light or the tulip table. Maybe its the way they look together. Very nice.
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,obamapastry,3,Mon Jul 13 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Have you seen the 3 part video on youtube titled ""Philosophy of light"" where PH is talking about light? That man was a visionary. His lamps make any space beautiful.   The tulip table is a thing of beauty .. the one I have is an older one, with a cast iron base and a walnut top. This table is decades old, but the previous owners took good care of it and I hope to do the same. I was apprehensive as to whether the chairs will go well with the table, but after I saw them together I knew I had made the right choice. The only set of windsor chairs I like more are Nakashima's,."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,Mundus_Vult_Decipi,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"I have seen that video and its amazing how he visualizes how to light a space and the thought involved in his designs.  I am keeping my eye out for a tulip table myself. The walnut top is a must also. I need one for my space that is about 50"" so sometimes its tricky to find the right one."
Mid_Century,3d2vuk,Mundus_Vult_Decipi,3,Mon Jul 13 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"Keep looking, it will show up. It took me 2-3 years to find just the table, and I passed on many other nice ones as I had decided on the smaller tulip table that fits my ideas and spaces better. It will also give time for you to save up!  I've seen some of your photos on this subreddit .. Do you have your photos organized as an album which I can see, please?"
Mid_Century,3d2oe7,MichaelSteeber,3,Mon Jul 13 01:14:25 2015 UTC,Awesome find! I really enjoy the Kent Coffey collections. I just picked up a continental complete bedroom set myself.
Mid_Century,3d2oe7,Beardedkid,2,Mon Jul 13 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"Nice, but I'm more envious of that Braun radio."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,vincent_vancough,13,Sun Jul 12 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"I would hesitate before doing anything more to that shell chair.  That style of drafting chair is a 1st edition design and quite rare. Your chair has much more value in all original condition with the original shockmounts, original vinyl cover and base.  If you don't want a drafting shell, I would urge you to sell your chair instead. An eames collector would love to have it.  It would be a travesty to ruin an original, early, rare eames design by putting on a knock off eiffel or dowel base which are a dime a dozen."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,and_ampersand_,8,Sun Jul 12 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't ruin it as long as he kept the base. Worst case, if he ever wants to sell it, he can just put the old base back on.   I guess there's principle involved, but that's silly emotional garbage when you're talking about a chair with intentionally swappable bases.   (I'm the resident Eames shell guy. I wrote the thing in the sidebar.)"
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,Woolio,3,Sun Jul 12 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I looked it up last night and found a few online going for a $400 or so (excluding the $1200 1st Dibs listing). One thing I could not find is a model number. I thought Eames Office used to have pictures and descriptions of almost every design and version on the site, but I cannot find it anymore.  What would be the most you would do to it?  I have the vinyl cover (which could be in better shape if my pictures don't reveal), the metal cable that secures the cover, and the piping that went around the edge of the chair. I could reassemble it if you think it prudent.   I knew it was a little rare (I thought the base was unoriginal at first) but I have no idea how I might actualize it's value, except at an auction house perhaps."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,Woolio,3,Sun Jul 12 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"Good, so you've got a removable cover and the drafting base. The bases are really easily removable, so if you want to convert it to a dining or lounge height, you can grab a base from Modern Conscience or Herman Miller or wherever and stick that on there.   Just put everything you've pulled off it in storage, and if you ever want to sell it or have a drafting chair again, put it all back on. You won't lose value just for taking it apart, unless you actually lose something. In fact, you'll be keeping the cover in the shape it's already in, which is better than letting it degrade further.   Don't try to do the Plastolux restoration on it, though. You want factory finish, in case you do try to sell it."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,Woolio,2,Sun Jul 12 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"Should I put new shock mounts on it? The ones on it are cracking, so I'm not sure how much I should trust them.   Am I right about the original manufacturer?"
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,and_ampersand_,6,Sun Jul 12 23:27:45 2015 UTC,No. Leave the old shock mounts on until they break. They'll hold better than you think they will.
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,codon,3,Sun Jul 12 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"As per the JF Chen Collection, the chair is a 622TS-1."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,OnlySlightlyEvil,3,Mon Jul 13 23:31:40 2015 UTC,What is just the base worth?
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Tue Jul 14 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"I see one on eBay for $250, but that is far from conclusive. I would prefer a better answer myself."
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,Moominsean,5,Tue Jul 14 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"Gah, I'm excited for you! Please update when finished.   And aren't thrift stores awesome?!"
Mid_Century,3d1ygt,codon,3,Sun Jul 12 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"I've been thrifting for years and this is my first Eames. And a rare one at that.   The thrift store where I found it is usually terrible, but on rare occasions they have some great stuff. My last significant find there was a Westnofa Siesta chair with a rosewood frame in really good shape for $15."

Mid_Century,3cqurk,SARASA05,3,Fri Jul 10 05:43:59 2015 UTC,"It is located about 8mi from Fallingwater at a resort called the Nemacolin, in Mill's Run, PA. The resort area itself, the one that houses this restaurant, is called Fallingrock and aped many architectural components from the FLW concepts, but in an odd, 'themed' way vs. a curated touch like some of the hotels people have been posting here. However, I did ask and was told that they incorporated MCM plating at the restaurant with some of their dishes."

Mid_Century,3cowmf,brittafiltaperry,5,Thu Jul 9 16:23:16 2015 UTC,My SO and I are building our mid century modern apartment piece by piece We're on a budget but I'm really happy with  this so far. We've ordered a smaller matching G Plan unit for the TV which hasn't arrived yet as it's from another seller. Both are from the Form Five collection.   Found the mirror for Â£75 on eBay. Does anyone know the designer? It's authentic and has Made In Denmark on the back. It's by far my favourite thing :)
Mid_Century,3cowmf,mullacc,2,Thu Jul 9 16:27:04 2015 UTC,are you in the UK? I see lots of nice G-Plan stuff on the UK eBay for really reasonable prices. I actually bought a set of nesting tables but shipping cost to the US nearly doubled the price.
Mid_Century,3cowmf,mullacc,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:32 2015 UTC,Yep in the UK :) This unit was Â£165 and delivery Â£45 which was a bargain!   I think G Plan is British made. Is it not common in the states?
Mid_Century,3cowmf,01110,2,Thu Jul 9 17:49:47 2015 UTC,It's not common but it's not super rare either. I'm not sure if G-Plan was ever sold here as new but people have definitely imported vintage pieces.

Mid_Century,3cn37m,kevan,4,Thu Jul 9 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the brand on this one. I have a Cosco cart and the casters are exactly the same, both the frame and the wheels in them. Plus the shelves both seem to have the exact same dimensions of that raised edged around each. They don't seem to be really similar or almost the same, they look like they came off the same manufacturing line and are 100% interchangeable.  Coscos usually seemed to have both legs be the same form factor. So if one side had the chrome handle, so did the other. If there were no handles and one side stopped at shelf level, so did the other. This one has one handle, one that stops at shelf level. Also when they stopped at shelf level, it seems like the Coscos usually had pipe end which tapered into the shelf. This one has pipes which are not tapered and are capped at the end.   Finally, every Cosco cart with an outlet I find an image of has the outlet screwed to the one of legs, and in fact it almost looks like some added it as an afterthought. This one is integrated into the top shelf.   So the last couple of paragraphs make it sound like I'm saying it isn't a Cosco, but to go back to the first paragraph, the casters on both the one that I have with a Cosco sticker and this one pictured are clearly the exact same ones. The wheels are the same shape and have the same molding seams. The wheel frames are the exact same shape. Even the damn shelves are exactly interchangeable. It's like either Cosco made both but tried a couple things on this one that were out of character, or 2 different companies made these, but they both sources some of the same parts and/or used some of the same manufacturing equipment on some areas of the carts, but did their own thing on other areas of the carts.  I dunno! Any ideas?"

Mid_Century,3cjmry,Philodendritic,3,Thu Jul 9 08:39:34 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm definitely going to research into using Danish oil on my piece. It has its original finish but has some scratches and peeling on the edges in a couple of places and is also covered in dust and animal hair. I'm sure it's best to restore it to its original stain so maybe this is the best idea.

Mid_Century,3cfzxl,SARASA05,3,Tue Jul 7 20:12:21 2015 UTC,Damn I have been eyeing those case study planters. West Elm has something similar on sale right now and will be getting more in August but the price is too similar to the actual case study planters for me to consider them... though the case study planters are way more than I would ever pay for a planter.

I got a stay here as a present last year too, and let me tell you I enjoyed it more than the park itself. Great furniture, decorating, and overall atmosphere. All the designer furniture was authentic too, which is something you don't see that often. Glad you enjoyed it!"
Mid_Century,3cdqgz,yourmommo,7,Tue Jul 7 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"Last year my wife surprised me with a three-day stay at the newly-opened Cabana Bay Resort, which is part of the Universal Studios chain.  I loved it, every square inch of it.  It's designed to be a modern recreation of what an upscale resort hotel built in the sixties would look like.    I am not associated with or advertising Cabana Bay or Universal Studios- I just wanted to share with you my photos.  Not all are great pictures, some are less than perfectly lit or composed.  But I think you'll get a good look at what the place looks like.  All photos are at full resolution (4320x2432) so every detail is resolved.  Pics may load slowly on slow connections.    And if you are in the area and want to immerse yourself in the mid-century experience, do stay there!  The resort has three wings, each with its own feel.  There are two pools, each with its own unique poolside bar, a bowling alley, an arcade/game room, and just tons of neat places to sit, hang out, and enjoy the ambiance.  We stayed there a few months after it opened, everything was still shiny and new.    Edit: Photo resolution info added"

I think if your post origionally clarified that you were inspired by MCM design and then built this end table that folks would have been like wtf - that's awesome! Most folks who clicked on this probably thought you bought something and painted it, which makes most of us sad. Building that end table is a whole other thing and I hope you continue to rock the beautiful angled and tapered legs. : )    I feel sorry because I bet you were excited to post this and didn't get a very positive response. You will definitely get will a better response if (as you said you plan to) did another piece with stain vs. paint. However.. whatever YOU like is what's important! A few weekends ago I did buy a piece of junk with MCM lines that was beyond rescue and was made from crappy, cheap materials and I ended up painting it and I'm pleased with it  the look... and my decision to buy the piece with the intention of painting it was a result of seeing a photo someone here posted of a piece they bought that was painted and I couldn't believe that I liked it!

Mid_Century,3cat4i,edgestander,-1,Mon Jul 6 13:36:55 2015 UTC,Don't credit this sub with the inspiration for painted furniture please. It is clearly stated in the rules of the sub that painted MCM furniture is not allowed.

OP didn't violate this nightstand. He didn't buy this somewhere and then ""spruce it up"" with a coat of paint (like so many people do to MCM furniture, and like the sidebar is [I assume] insinuating). OP built the nightstand, inspired by pieces he has seen on this sub, and painted it. Nothing ruined or violated, simply a project finished in the way he wanted it."
Mid_Century,3cat4i,LetSlipTheDogesOfWar,0,Tue Jul 7 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"That's like... Your opinion man.  Ok so I don't see anywhere the rules say it has to be ""old"" or ""vintage"" furniture that is violated.  So OP made a ""new"" shabby chic table and some how that's fits in an MCM sub.  Look at it this way,  he built a perfectly good table,  then he decided to violate it,  to me it makes no difference that he first assembled the table before he painted it. It's a fine table,  I just don't see how it is inspired by this sub in any way.   Edit: I will readily admit I am being a big of a dick here.  Good job building a table, I have never done that.  I guess I just see OP's inspiration as a little misguided."

Mid_Century,3bzt8u,Gruns,3,Tue Jul 7 08:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well I sold it in 3 days for $1,500"
Mid_Century,3by017,Lyrical_Word_Smith,8,Fri Jul 3 02:20:11 2015 UTC,Looks pretty dated to me. You could always jazz it up with a fresh coat of paint and maybe sponge with a second color to add some texture! /s
Mid_Century,3by017,adnaus,14,Fri Jul 3 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking small...I may just end up doing a full mosaic on the top, then replacing the legs with hairpin legs, and THEN paint it--maybe a glitter paint of some kind, you know very Great Gatsby--MCM?"
Mid_Century,3by017,vincent_vancough,2,Fri Jul 3 04:00:34 2015 UTC,That looks like walnut to me.  Excellent job!  The grain is beautiful regardless.
Mid_Century,3by017,trollymctrollstein,3,Fri Jul 3 02:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's definitely rosewood - I need to get the top professionally refinished (it's a little warped from being left outside!). I like using pure tung oil which works GREAT for teak, but doesn't quite work perfect with rosewood. Regardless my main concern was getting moisture back into the wood due to the warping."
Mid_Century,3bz893,obamapastry,6,Fri Jul 3 10:11:01 2015 UTC,"If you like it, get it. Where else are you going to get a chest of drawers for Â£60?"
Mid_Century,3bz893,Casey--,3,Fri Jul 3 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"You can't get a modern press board dresser for $90. If you like it, and need a dresser, I don't see a downside here."
Mid_Century,3bz893,FreeSammiches,3,Fri Jul 3 11:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd pay that in a second.  It's beautiful and you have to rescue it. :)"
Mid_Century,3bz893,prettyslattern,3,Fri Jul 3 18:35:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I would pay that.  I like the style.  Offer $75?
Mid_Century,3bz893,edgestander,3,Fri Jul 3 14:06:18 2015 UTC,"Really beautiful booking on the front veneers. I see some scuffs and nicks in the lower drawers on the corner, but all in all, it looks like it's in good shape with original pulls. No obvious signs of repairs (e.g., on the legs). Once you see it, you might offer Â£50 and see if the seller bites. The money saved might help pay for renting a small truck for the transportation."
Mid_Century,3bz893,mcfandrew,2,Sun Jul 5 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"I've collected it! It looks great, I ended up picking up an old campaign dresser in need of some serious work from the same guy and have been working on that."
Mid_Century,3bvdor,EnidColeslawToo,18,Thu Jul 2 13:37:58 2015 UTC,That is f-ing gorgeous.  Great find and GREAT job on the reupholstery.  My envy is strong.
Mid_Century,3bvdor,thedepster,8,Thu Jul 2 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I thought he was punking me when he texted me the photo (he's a notorious prankster) and said he found it on the side of the road.   He even stabilized it for me - since one side needed a bit of wood glue. I did a gentle re-surfacing, but it deserves more of my time in the refinishing department.   The teal tweed really did come to me in a dream though. So glad I decided to go that route. So happy!"
Mid_Century,3bvdor,chzplz,4,Thu Jul 2 14:40:43 2015 UTC,You have better taste in your dreams than I do when I'm awake. I would have gone with something conservative. Yours is gorgeous.

I was at some rundown mom & pop antique place and saw a beautiful set of 4 MCM dining room chairs (I forget the designer at this point). Thinking I may have hit the jack pot, I checked the label and then the pricetag... $1,400. They knew what they had."

Mid_Century,3byfjw,Del33t,6,Fri Jul 3 04:39:35 2015 UTC,Maybe the base is not original and they modified the shell to fit it?
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Philodendritic,5,Fri Jul 3 04:41:21 2015 UTC,That definitely could be it.... Shame if that's true.
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Philodendritic,2,Fri Jul 3 04:43:31 2015 UTC,It kills it for me.
Mid_Century,3byfjw,edgestander,5,Fri Jul 3 21:04:15 2015 UTC,For the record if the shell is stamped Herman miller it's legit.  Knockoffs in furniture aren't exactly the same as a knock off LV purse or something. The knock off Eames will usually have no label or marking and mounting.
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Trestar11,4,Fri Jul 3 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"The boot glides look funny, and at first I thought the shock mounts from the base were bleeding, but then I saw those massive bolts mounting the base the wrong way. The shell looks legit, but I wouldn't buy this at all. It's stuck with those undesirable stacking bases forever."
Mid_Century,3byfjw,edgestander,2,Fri Jul 3 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"Glad you share my thoughts. When I saw it first come up I got a little excited about the 100$ price tag but when I saw what had been done to it, I wouldn't even pay 10$."
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Trestar11,3,Fri Jul 3 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I paid $75 for one of these in very good condition and I kind of think I paid too much as I am sure I will run into some one day in the $20 range.  With damage like this one has, I wouldn't pay more than $10 thats for sure."
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Woolio,3,Fri Jul 3 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's too bad. These shells are getting increasingly harder to find in my city and area (Louisville, KY) At the antique shop I work at we sell the shells for $125 with basic, stacking or the student bases when we have them."
Mid_Century,3byfjw,Trestar11,3,Fri Jul 3 14:29:28 2015 UTC,"I know a guy in Knoxville selling seven upholstered shells with stacking bases for $200. If you're interested, here's the Craigslist link.

Mid_Century,3bwg41,wegnerthrowaway,2,Thu Jul 2 21:27:58 2015 UTC,That's all she said. I figured it was because it wasn't particularly valuable and they're trying to hide that behind the price.
Mid_Century,3bwg41,obamapastry,5,Fri Jul 3 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"Wegner JH555 settee, 1st dibs has it at almost ten times the price  https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/seating/settees/hans-wegner-settee-johannes-hansen-model-jh-555/id-f_2450892/  also on page 30 of the Wright catalogue linked to here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ScandinavianInterior/comments/3brorq/wright_auction_house_downloadable_2015_catalog/  enjoy"
Mid_Century,3bwg41,mullacc,3,Fri Jul 3 07:28:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's a replica of the Wegner but I highly doubt it's genuine. Partly as they're saying it's not vintage and partly as it doesn't have all the little curves that the Wegner does. It also appears that the support rod underneath the seat is made of rounded dowel rather than a thin, rounded edged plank like on the Wegner. pic to explain what I mean"
Mid_Century,3bwg41,kingpinjoel,2,Fri Jul 3 10:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, and also it appears that where the seat meets the back has no gap like the Wegner and other differences.  I still think it's pretty."
Mid_Century,3bwg41,yourmommo,2,Fri Jul 3 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"lol. why are you posting this info and not just buying it yourself?  I'd give it a shot too but after looking at the pictures I think it is a reproduction. The Wegner has support bars that go from the front legs to the middle of the sofa. In OP's picture you can't see where those bars go--they seem to have a steeper angle to them and may not reach all the way to the middle. But, more obviously, the OP's bars are round while the Wegner versions are oblong (from this Lauritz auction).  Also, that settee at Lauritz has a label right under the front lip in the middle. Seems like it would be hard to miss that.   But I'm no Wegner expert. Maybe there are variations between years or manufacturers or whatever."
Mid_Century,3bwg41,obamapastry,2,Fri Jul 3 11:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well, $2000 is a lot for me to spend on a piece that may be a shitty reproduction.  Also, I didn't know anything about it and if it was worth the money so I came here to get some information to do my homework.  Also, it's in Toronto and I'm in Ottawa so if I buy it it likely means I'll have to rent a truck and drive 4.5 hrs to collect it - that doesn't sound cheap either.  Edit: Sorry, didn't see the comment tree - you likely aren't asking me."

Mid_Century,3bj0v6,noseparade,2,Mon Jun 29 17:20:08 2015 UTC,Just curious what % of a discount the hole would cause? Say its a $2K piece.
Mid_Century,3bj0v6,chzplz,3,Mon Jun 29 22:19:46 2015 UTC,Don't discount old MCM stereo cabinets.  They're not as valuable to collectors.    I ripped the guts out of one and put all my components inside the old speaker sections.  The IR remotes work through the front speaker fabric.    Not a great solution if you want to change media (CD/DVD etc) tho - mine is all digital.
Mid_Century,3bj0v6,F-That,4,Mon Jun 29 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"I would not do that to one of my pieces, but like others have said, its yours so do whatever you want. If I was going to media storage, I would look at Eames storage units or something similar. Or maybe buy something new that is build for what you want it to do but has the same style. Maybe something like this for a fraction of the price and put your nice vintage piece somewhere else.   http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=32313421&category=A_FURN_STORAGE  http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=29959764&category=A_FURN_STORAGE"

Mid_Century,3bj0v6,mullacc,2,Mon Jun 29 22:27:05 2015 UTC,you could always just buy a contemporary version. Ikea and CB2 both have nice looking Danish-style credenzas.  EDIT: or a higher-end version from Room & Board or Thrive.

If you really keep it forever then you won't be ruining it, but increasing its functional value.  Though if you ever need to sell it any modifications will decrease value.  If it were me I would probably try to find a Martinsville or lane Cardenza on CL or a thrift store and modify that.  The pieces I keep, are because I love the design and art it represents, to me this would be the equivilant of buying a Picasso and cutting 3"" off the outside so you could fit in a frame you have lying around."

I don't get your Picasso comparison. I'm not cutting the credenza down to size to fit my room. I'm considering a small hole in the back side to feed wires through. Not really the same thing."
Mid_Century,3bj0v6,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 29 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"No, but it accomplishes the same thing in result to value.

Mid_Century,3bgzuz,Veryintelligentguy,10,Mon Jun 29 03:35:17 2015 UTC,i'm gonna say it was one of the thousands of semi-local furniture manufactures across the country that borrowed ideas and inspiration from the more affluent designers of the era.
Mid_Century,3bgzuz,Dildorthemagnificent,4,Mon Jun 29 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"This one is mine - made by ""Rowe"" and built in 1969.  I go back and forth on thinking it's legit. Probably isn't.  Almost want to believe that, now that my son has opened up a gash in the rightmost back cushion.    My other possible Pearsall from Steelcase, I am 99.9% sure is legit - minus the upholstery, which the original owner had done in the 80's - I'll redo it at some point  You can almost never say for sure - Pearsall designs did come out of more than a few labels.  But the Pearsall family have pulled all back catalogs off the internet.  They claimed that they were being used to make knock offs.  As though a knockoff manufacturer wouldn't be able to find any photos of them on the internet.  Or acquire one to tear down.    But the Pearsalls will verify your piece for you.  If you send them money.  But I almost don't care to know.  One sofa cost me $400, and another $500.  If even one is legit then OMG it's worth thousands! Who cares.  That's nice, but I bought them because they were pieces that I liked a lot and could afford."
Mid_Century,3bgzuz,ZaphodsJustThisGuy,2,Tue Jun 30 02:17:13 2015 UTC,Why do you think your Rowe and steelcases sofas are pearsall I have never heard of anyone claiming he designed for those companies?  Please explain?
Mid_Century,3bgzuz,edgestander,2,Tue Jun 30 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not sure that the Rowe one is a Pearsall - I think it probably isn't.   I've seen some ""confirmed"" Pearsalls that are awfully similar, but I'm not at all certain.    The other one - GIS Pearsall Sofa.  You'll see a half dozen exactly like it on the first page.  Same carved walnut piece at the front, same leg placement, same Italian marble end table pieces.    I can't be sure it was Steelcase - that's not marked anywhere that I could find on it, and though the quite elderly lady I bought it from insisted that's what it was, it's not that hard to conflate  one popular manufacturer with another after nearly 50 years.  I'm more doubtful that it's a Steelcase than I am it being a Pearsall.    But again....I don't care.  I'm not selling it for three grand.  I'm keeping it.  Because I like it and want it in my home.  Which is the point of all this."
Mid_Century,3bgzuz,ZaphodsJustThisGuy,3,Wed Jul 1 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"Ok cool.  So no offense but this sounds like some wishful thinking.  I have never seen a Rowe sofa actually attributed to pearsall or anything linking him to the company.  Now the other sofa, nothing comes up when I search for steelcases sofas.  Now Craft Associates is not phonetically similar to Steelcases, but flexsteel is.  Voila, flexsteel made a sofa exactly like yours.  So I guess the second one is inconclusive, but I would guess flexsteel in the manner of AP."

Mid_Century,3bi5px,bidoville,4,Mon Jun 29 14:38:15 2015 UTC,It's a first for me. I was walking home from the train and I saw it sitting out by the dumpster at an apartment complex. I had to carry it ten or fifteen blocks home but I figure if I can manage to reupholster it it was absolutely worth the effort.
Mid_Century,3bi5px,bidoville,3,Mon Jun 29 15:31:37 2015 UTC,Absolutely! The lines are spectacular.
Mid_Century,3bi5px,edgestander,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:23 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is Paoli?  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a1/72/16/a17216d994d0ad636dfa1f53788affab.jpg  I know it's not the exact same but the arm rest looks like them.
Mid_Century,3bi5px,edgestander,4,Mon Jun 29 13:55:11 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from with the arms but the cut doesn't seem quit right. The shaping on the chair you posted us is much more severe.   I'll try to take a couple more photos that better detail the shape of the armrests.
Mid_Century,3bi5px,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 29 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"See the cut is exactly what made me think paoli, had to verify the armrests.  This is not designer so you may never find an exact match, but I bet if you mor throughly search for Paoli chairs you will see that this is very similar."
Mid_Century,3bi5px,bidoville,2,Mon Jun 29 16:21:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip.   I suppose in the end it doesn't matter all that much who designed it. I like it.
Mid_Century,3bi5px,yourmommo,3,Mon Jun 29 16:51:51 2015 UTC,Exactly.  It's a nice chair and the price was right.  I think on this you are looking for a manufacturer not a designer.

But those tube amps on the floor? I don't know audio equipment but that stuff must cost a fortune. Putting it all on the floor is the worst kind of fakery--as if he's too engaged in the music to give a shit about shelving.  The stack of books used as a side table? Ugh.  Is that vintage Filson (?) bag a decorative piece? God I hope not. That would be the worst.  A vintage motorcycle as interior decoration? I want to say it's gross. But...eh, it's pretty cool.

My first thought was, ""how did that person die?""  A quiet afternoon, the lazy sunbeams shone through the window. The grandfather places his newspapers down on the coffee table and starts looked through photographs he laid out. One was from a recent fishing trip. One was from their honeymoon. One was from inside a car during a long trip. One was of her just before the diagnosis. There were no more photos taken after.  The grandson got tired of playing with his new toy truck on the carpet, and abandons it to search through the Sunday morning comics on the floor. They will will pick him up around 5:30, and then they'll all go out for dinner. The doorbell rings. The grandson runs to greet his mother and father. The grandfather stands up and walk toward the door. A piece of the newspaper obscured the toy truck. He steps on it, falls backward, instinctively grasping at a couch pillow. He hits his head on the table. The toy truck is broken.  Mother called for an ambulance. Father rushed the boy to the car and parked out of sight to ensure the child is not perturbed. 2 hours later, the last of the medics leaves and closes the door behind him. Mother sobbed for weeks. Father looked over stacks paperwork and made many somber telephone calls.  Grandpa is busy this weekend.   Grandpa moved to Winnipeg, we'll go visit him next Christmas.  Yes, grandpa is doing very well and he says he misses you too.  Grandpa says he loves you very much."

Mid_Century,3azukt,F-That,2,Wed Jun 24 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"You can get a brand new one for $799. So nearly $3200 for a set of four. Herman Miller stuff goes on sale for 15% once (or twice?) a year, so knock that down to $2720.   BTW, four years ago they were $499. I wish I could find a price list further back. I think 10-15 years ago they were closer to $300.  Anyway, if you told me you paid $1000 for this set, I'd think you did pretty good. If you paid $1600--and these fulfill an actual need for dining chairs--then I'd think that's probably fair. But I wouldn't pay that much just to own some DCMs."

And, $200 for a solid wood dresser is an amazing deal if you consider what's available today. $200 will only get you a pressed cardboard Ikea/Target/Walmart piece you'll have to put together.    The lines are excellent, and it has great legs. Is it missing a mirror? Look for brackets on the back -- another bargaining chip. Chips like that are near impossible to repair, so if it doesn't bother you it is another negotiation point. Good luck!"

Mid_Century,3an27z,literlick,4,Sun Jun 21 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"I see MCM as the trailing edge of a time when things were hand crafted out of quality materials and were designed to outlive the owner.   I don't think there are enough large, high grade pieces of walnut and teak left on this planet to repeat that era. Those trees grow slowly compared to beech, ash and the other soft woods used in today's reproductions."
Mid_Century,3an27z,MatJosher,4,Mon Jun 22 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"You don't need them. Any skilled woodworker can make a solid plank of hardwood half a foot thick and six feet across using standard joinery, and if he's really good, he can match the grain so it looks right.   The bottom line is that it's just cheaper to make throwaway furniture. Always has been. But the good stuff survives, and that's what makes the mid-century different from anything past it.   Nothing we make today will survive. Which, if you think about it, is kind of sad."
Mid_Century,3an27z,Woolio,5,Mon Jun 22 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really mean to argue. But I think the point is that there is nothing we make today, at affordable prices for everyone, that is meant to survive. There are still plenty of high end furniture and design brands that are build quality.  And it is slowly coming back around to lower cost and more affordability."
Mid_Century,3an27z,jakrus,3,Mon Jun 22 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'd encourage you to look at some old Sears catalogs, and run some numbers through an inflation convertor. It might be kind of interesting.  Nothing we collect today was particularly affordable back then. An armchair would easily run $1000 or more in today's money, and they still produced the throwaway furniture too."
Mid_Century,3an27z,Woolio,5,Mon Jun 22 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Brochure  Source: http://ranchoredux.blogspot.com/2011/01/planner-group-catalog.html  Here is a brochure for Paul McCobb's Planner Group. With what seems to be hand written prices. In the comments the lady said her mom bought the furniture in 1959.Here is a brochure for Paul McCobb's Planner Group. With what seems to be hand written prices. The cabinet 1513-L is label at 109.50 run through a random inflation catalog, it gives me a price of 905.34.  I would say that price is comparable to something at crate and barrel (ex Rigby Media Console ). Which probably decent quality but it most likely will not stand the test of time as collectible pieces that people will want to buy 60 years in the future.   But a contemporary piece done by a contemporary designer say this one, http://www.moooi.com/products/zio-buffet sells for 5,480. I don't know, or really think, that this will be sought after forever, but it is well made piece by an established designer. And that is the price it commands.  The point I am getting at is that there is alway's well designed furniture that is new and upcoming, but during the mid-century there was a lot of culture reasons why people where more interested in new and contemporary design, which led to that furniture be produced for a more broad market and people knowing that it existed. The options for cheaper furniture where also much more limited and people still had a buy it for life attitude and not just get some shit to fill up my house (i am sure lots a people still had that idea, too). This all also coincided with the rise of the suburban class of people and an American society that was still taught to respect art, and pay attention to what was happening with American art and design (which some say was a cold war tactic, but that is a little of topic).  There is just more mid-century furniture around that has been taken care off and those people who bought it are dying off, and our generation has been seeing as good deals on great design. The article goes in too much better details about what happened to cause this thinking.  After all my rambling. The main issue I have is just the statement, Nothing we make today will survive. And I believe that is untrue."

The reason is that this subreddit is devoted to specifically mid century modern furniture, which this piece is certainly not. I think it could be from the middle(ish) part of the last century but is not reflective of the type of furniture people on this sub are passionate about. It certainly looks like a sturdy piece of furniture and that laminate is going to be near impossible to destroy so it will be a useful piece of furniture for many years but it has no real collectible value what so ever and was not made by a prominent mid century designer."

Mid_Century,3a73zu,opabiniarex,7,Wed Jun 17 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"Might have a chance to buy this (from a dealer who knows mid century). I haven't gotten a price for it yet, but I'd like to do a little research before hand. From what I can tell, I think it's Yugoslavian made, though it's definitely Danish style.   I've seen modulars like this go anywhere between 500 and 2000.   Any thoughts?"
Mid_Century,3a73zu,F-That,7,Wed Jun 17 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"I would expect to pay around $1000 for it. Try for less if you can but with danish Cado units about the same size going for $1500 to $2500, I would expect this one to be less. Try for $500 of course. Good luck."
Mid_Century,3a73zu,oustoublier,5,Wed Jun 17 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think it totally depends on what region of the U.S. you're in.   I'm in the Midwest, and I'd agree that $1000-$1200 seems about what you'd expect, depending on the condition. Make sure you check it out in person before handing over any cash."
Mid_Century,3a73zu,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 17 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"This sold in Cleveland for $550 or so a couple weeks ago, I know the guy who bought it. https://www.aspireauctions.com/#!/catalog/345/1782/lot/74787/image"
Mid_Century,3a73zu,Centone,3,Thu Jun 18 02:05:23 2015 UTC,"Offer $500 but I wouldn't go over $700. I see similar units frequently at thrift stores and estate sales in the ATL area. I scored one for $40 a few years ago but that was a steal. Definitely check it out in person first. The main issues I've seen on these are the lower panel of the cabinets sagging (especially the one below the TV in your photo, they were often used as record storage and could not handle the weight) and if there's is a key for the drop front section in the center (covered by the bird fabric)."
Mid_Century,3a73zu,Centone,4,Thu Jun 18 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"Also, as far as comp prices on eBay go, understand that this type of sale is all about local. No one wants to deal with shipping one of these. If it's a local purchase you should easily be able to negotiate for less than eBay sold prices since there are no selling/shipping/PayPal fees etc."
Mid_Century,3a73zu,Centone,3,Thu Jun 18 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Good advices. I was thinking 1000 would be my upper limit, but what you say about location makes sense. It's funny, in looking around today I saw a lot on 1stdibs for CRAZY prices. Does anyone actually pay as much as they list for on there? I have seen it in person (well, it's in the display window of the shop now - and fortunately only for a few days, so there isn't any sun bleaching!) The only damage I saw was a small chip on the lower right leg. I'll check the shelves for sagging though. In terms of wood, I'm thinking it's probably rosewood, but I don't know. Anyone have an idea?"
Mid_Century,3a73zu,riomx,3,Thu Jun 18 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"First Dibs is primarily a ""to the trade"" retail pricing setup (or at least used to be when they first started, not sure how they operate these days). The retailers on there have a primary market of interior decorators buying for clients in major cities and as such the prices are inflated. It's a great site for research but take the pricing with a grain of salt."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,StatusSC,4,Wed Jun 17 16:48:39 2015 UTC,There were definitely high back versions of Kofod Larsen's Seal and Elizabeth chairs. But I don't think this is one of those.  Here's a designaddict post about a similar chair.
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,mullacc,4,Wed Jun 17 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"Whoa...I think I found them?  The sofa looks exactly like this one. It sounds like a contemporary custom job?  I don't see a high back version of the chair, but everything else about these look right.  EDIT: here's an eBay page for the same seller."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,mullacc,4,Wed Jun 17 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah those do look pretty close, I wonder how long they've been selling those for. This chair is in Canada so I just assumed it was vintage. The only difference I see in the sofa are the cushions.  Thanks for the help. Now I just need to figure out if I want to spend $650 on it."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,mullacc,3,Wed Jun 17 18:41:54 2015 UTC,$650 for just the chair or both pieces?
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,mullacc,2,Wed Jun 17 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"Chair only, not all that interested in the sofa."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 17 18:48:59 2015 UTC,Damn. Probably too much unless it's just the exact thing you want.
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,2,Wed Jun 17 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"agreed $650 for a used repo, um no thank you."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,2,Thu Jun 18 00:43:41 2015 UTC,So is the verdict on this that's a moder repo.  If so I must say Damn it's getting hard out there for collectors.  If I saw this on CL I would have thought it was the real deal.
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,2,Thu Jun 18 15:39:00 2015 UTC,I've actually had some help and was able to find out that it is a genuine Peter Wessel chair. You can see another one here.   https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/s306x306/e15/1171881_1511250369118818_281054846_n.jpg  Definitely going to pick it up ASAP.
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,F-That,2,Fri Jun 19 13:55:41 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like a Kofod larsen Elizabeth chair.  Some detail pics might help zero in on it. If it is an Elizabeth chair it is quite rare, desireable, and valuable."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,4,Wed Jun 17 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think this chair is a little taller, it also has a matching sofa. I'm afraid that's the only photo there is   Here is the sofa http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDI3WDY0MA==/z/oJ4AAOSwBahVfC69/$_20.JPG"
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,tallread1,2,Wed Jun 17 17:16:05 2015 UTC,"Ok I thought I had seen the Elizabeth chair with a high back, but now I see enough differences that it is not it.  I still think this is larsen, but can't find the exact one. If it's a knock off its a damn good one."
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,F-That,4,Wed Jun 17 17:48:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I can't seem to find this chair online anywhere. Thank you for the help though. I'm considering buying it and not sure how much I want to spend.
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 17 18:08:39 2015 UTC,The Elizabeth has arms that wrap around the back of the chair and I believe the Seal chair is the one that looks like its bottom support is missing and its going to fall into the frame. I believe. I think there are 4 other lb Kofod Larsen chairs like these but I don't know the names. The one I have i'm unsure of what its called. Its king of a half Seal chair half Elizabeth. The problem is so many people call them the wrong name online so its hard to track down what ones they actually are.   Good place to look is here.  http://www.deconet.com/decopedia/designer/Ib-Kofod-Larsen-id-615
Mid_Century,3a6iw3,kcpr1441,2,Wed Jun 17 21:20:22 2015 UTC,Be nice to have a catalog.
Mid_Century,3a5y4s,sadinternet,3,Wed Jun 17 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"I can't give you a positive ID, but this looks like Yugoslavian made to me.  Could american, but with you saying the lady was Polish, I would say it's from yugo.  Square legs and side rails = not Danish MCM about 99% of the time. Wish I could help more. Nice sofa though."
Mid_Century,3a5y4s,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 17 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  You're right about the legs, I didn't recognize the piece as Danish."
Mid_Century,3a5y4s,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 17 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. It's ""Danish style"" though I would say."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,HeavyCream,8,Wed Jun 17 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Why is it that amazing vintage designs always end up in the hands of people that are absolutely ignorant about them?
Mid_Century,3a42nz,riomx,9,Wed Jun 17 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I am not complaining."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,vincent_vancough,5,Wed Jun 17 03:13:18 2015 UTC,Funny thing the back of the couch has two really big pieces of walnut and even everything underneath that you don't even see is heavy solid walnut. Obviously it high  quality. I don't know how people miss that stuff.
Mid_Century,3a42nz,riomx,3,Wed Jun 17 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"Well...the good thing is that it went home to someone that appreciated it. If someone is clueless enough to give something like that up despite obvious signs of quality, it's best that they didn't keep it."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,ComplimentCommenter,4,Wed Jun 17 04:15:14 2015 UTC,It only seems that way because only the absolutely ignorant ones put them up for sale or get rid of them.  There are tons that sit perfectly appreciated in the comfort of their owner's house.
Mid_Century,3a42nz,Toppo,3,Thu Jun 18 22:48:21 2015 UTC,You don't hear about/notice the items that are with people who value them and sell them with great price. You only notice the rock in the stream.
Mid_Century,3a42nz,riomx,2,Wed Jun 17 14:29:09 2015 UTC,Very true
Mid_Century,3a42nz,Woolio,2,Wed Jun 17 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"Because, when these pieces were first for sale, you had to buy them through an interior designer. A lot of people used interior designers, since you couldn't really buy furniture yourself. Showrooms weren't a thing until Design Within Reach showed up in the 50s, and then department stores ran with that idea.   EDIT: Scratch that, I'm wrong. This wasn't produced until 1978, well beyond the showrooms and department stores... So I have no idea where they got the Eames couch."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,vincent_vancough,6,Wed Jun 17 09:01:10 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  I've had my fair share of luck, but nothing of that caliber."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,riomx,7,Wed Jun 17 03:13:02 2015 UTC,My brother and his wife were working the tag sale and I just bought a bought a 70's modern house. Do you think they thought to call me?  Nope they told me on Monday after I'd already seen the couch on listed craigslist for $5500
Mid_Century,3a42nz,F-That,3,Wed Jun 17 03:55:42 2015 UTC,Wow. That's sad. I take back my previous comment above. Of course it would be bought by flippers.
Mid_Century,3a42nz,mullacc,2,Wed Jun 17 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"$5500 is a great price for that really. If i was local, I would be chatting with the seller to try to make a deal. I want an Eames sofa so bad."
Mid_Century,3a42nz,Woolio,2,Wed Jun 17 10:42:06 2015 UTC,What kind of chairs did she have?
Mid_Century,3a42nz,tyrer,4,Wed Jun 17 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"That's not just any Herman Miller couch, that's an Eames couch. Last thing the Eameses designed before Charles died.   They're absolutely beautiful."

Mid_Century,3a1rsz,externality,2,Wed Jun 17 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"This piece was in pretty bad shape when I bought it. Paint was all scuffed, chipped, cracked, and the front plate had a ton of wear. The cloth grille was all stained and yellowed as well. The restoration only cost me a few dollars and my free time. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the original knobs were replaced."
Mid_Century,3a1rsz,PeesOnToiletSeats,2,Tue Jun 16 15:43:10 2015 UTC,Very cool. You can see the one my dad bought new in Germany when he was a kid in this photo of my current setup.  http://imgur.com/cR9g2gw

Mid_Century,3a1rsz,CattMristoff,2,Tue Jun 16 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"I should check for a model number. My dad rewired it when he moved to the US. It has always worked. I just pulled it from the garage last year and now it just gives a loud hum. Turned it off, dusted it off and will have to find someone trustworthy to have a look at it."

Mid_Century,3a4906,WildeCat96,3,Wed Jun 17 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"Other than someone appreciating that you did the work, I don't think changing the mounts from wide to narrow would increase the value of a shell. The wide mount shells aren't usually as old as the more collectible early shells, so the price difference isn't really all that different from the narrow shells of the same age. An orange or blue shell from the 60s or 70s can be found for $50-$100 regardless of mounts. And the original bases certainly can add to the value, as in the eiffel bases. It's tough to give away the wide mount stackable bases. So really for the amount of work involved and the money spent on parts, I don't really think it would be a ""money maker"". Unless you just want to do it to do it. I have a couple chairs I'm slowly converting and getting the old mounts off is a pain."
Mid_Century,3a4906,Moominsean,2,Wed Jun 17 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"I changed out 4 side chairs to narrow mount. Took about an hour to do and then another day for the epoxy to dry. I did this because I wanted them for my dining room and not to re-sell. I have 4 more that I'm going to do for a friend before I give them to him.   I totally agree with you about the price. It may help you sell them if they are narrow mount, but not for much more. Just more options for bases is all."
Mid_Century,3a36kx,riomx,3,Tue Jun 16 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Nice set.  Finding a dresser is really high on the list of things I want to find.  Unfortunately every one I fine is worse for wear, with major chips or flaws in the veneer.  I hope I get lucky and find a set as nice as this."

Here in Denver credenzas and dressers, as well as entire bedroom sets are easy to find in great shape.  Lounge chairs and fabric sofas or club seats are another story. Hard to find any that aren't beat or dirty."
Mid_Century,3a36kx,vincent_vancough,2,Wed Jun 17 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in the midwest.  I check craigslist and thrift stores very frequently.  I have come across a few pieces, but I am pretty particular and nothing has been the perfect mix of aesthetics and condition for me."
Mid_Century,3a1qc1,obamapastry,7,Tue Jun 16 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"This is the obvious answer, but I can't not pick my Eames lounges.   Story time: My obsessive Craigslisting paid off, and I found them buried in a listing for a moving sale. They were listed as being in fair condition - one of the shock mounts had come apart (easy fix), and the owners had cats, so there were some small scratches in the leather. Barely noticeable, really.  At the time, I didn't want to say how much I paid, but it's over a year ago now, so what the heck. It was $1200 for the pair: $800 for the non-broken one, and $400 for the broken one. (I know.) Apparently nobody else had seen the listing, because the owner never gave any hint that there were other people in line behind me...and they seemed to know what they had, so I have no idea why they were asking so little.   Anyway, I zoomed over there right after work, originally planning to buy both and sell one to pay for the other. Well, once I saw them, I couldn't make myself separate them. I took one home, and I left the other one in my boyfriend's garage, because he lived close by to someone who could fix the shock mount.  Well, the very next day, my boyfriend's mom was in the garage and she tripped while getting out of the car...falling on the broken lounge and snapping the wood right in half.  She felt horrible and couldn't stop crying, which in turn made me feel horrible because she had also hurt herself...but honestly, I wasn't too worried about the chair, because we immediately got referred to someone who could fix it, less than 5 minutes from home. It ended up taking much longer than expected (two months instead of two weeks), but when the lounge was returned to me, I swear, you can't even see the seam. At all. It's fixed flawlessly - and for only $180! I could take a picture of where it broke, but I'm honestly not sure if I could even find it.   Today, it sits happily in my living room, while its companion is in the other room, waiting for me to reupholster my couch. The end."

No maker's marks or anything, but it is solid and very well-constructed. Acquiring it helped me refine my preference for walnut furniture and pushed me to part with everything that didn't match well, including a large Danish teak table with hide-away leaves and matching chairs.  I combined walnut-veneered Realistic speakers and a Pioneer SX-727 receiver (now an SX-950), and I'm going to replace the laminate veneer on my Pioneer PL-55X turntable with walnut veneer so it matches. Eventually I'd like to get a walnut credenza to match so I can move all of the audio gear to the other side of the room, but for now it's nice to have everything close so I can listen to music or have full sound when I watch movies and work.  Also, this year I went independent and work from home, so it is now the desk I use to work most. I'm also launching a new site and since I love the grain patterns, I'll be taking photos to use as backgrounds."

Being on a corner lot we have 3 large picture windows that need to be replaced. The basement has the original knotty pine paneling. The original asbestos roof really needs replacing. The plaster walls are so much better than sheetrock. We did restore our bathroom recently to the Ming Green.

The property is 65 acres with a 12 acre private lake with thousands of 5lb bass, and it has a separate 2 acre swimming pond with sand beach.

It's not the biggest house, but the space is well thought out, the yard is nice and big and very secret garden-like.  We also have a detached workshop/garage with a carport.  There are lots of fruit bearing trees, privacy fence and patios everywhere.    Here is a link to an album I just threw together.

A few small original bits, some repro and some modern MCM influenced stuff. The modern stuff even includes some Ikea bits. Their Stockholm range is their higher quality stuff, and a bunch is influenced more or less by pieces thed did in the late 50s when they started."

It's pretty boring on the outside (just a rectangular brick house) but it has some amazing original features like the Weldtex accent wall in the living room (that our realtor suggest we remove--the nerve!) still in great condition, an all-original tiled bathroom (very similar to this including the color but I have the original flooring--in matching brown, not pink--as well), and hardwood floors. The basement has been finished (though it also has knotty pine paneling which I'm not sure is original? like this but only on the top half of the wall) and there are some more modern upgrades down there (second bathroom, for example), but yeah... it's a great house and I'm totally in love. We try our best to outfit it with mid-century furniture either vintage or inspired.  Edited to add photos I forgot I do actually have...these are all from 5+ years ago (when we first moved in):  Living room (with accent wall, we hung vertical blinds in place of those old horizontal ones) *better photo  Weldtex accent wall close up (ignore the cat)  Basement stairs (pine paneling)  Bathroom (it's a mess, sorry)  Hallway (the only place our hardwood floors are exposed are the hallway and dining room)"

It is one of many mass-market builder's houses in our neighborhood. It isn't a unique one-off but so many things are right (style, size, location, and a relatively unmodified interior) we couldn't pass it up.

Mid_Century,39zixh,F-That,4,Tue Jun 16 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"I work as a 3D artist and love to model furniture for interior pieces. Especially mid-century stuff. Unfortunately outside of ogling, and knowing a little history, I don't know a thing about how to approach restoration. I'm very DIY with basic wood working and am not afraid to delve in. However, I'm a little weary of trying my hand with what looks like a special find.   Do you guys have any opinions as to how I should proceed based on the photos?  I'm just lost all over. I would like to keep these for myself but to make them functional I feel like I should restore them. But if these are special as they are right now, I don't want to commit the ultimate act of sacrilege. So please, all thoughts are welcome!"
Mid_Century,39zixh,F-That,7,Tue Jun 16 01:50:41 2015 UTC,Don't restore those. They have to be trashed to make it worth it to restore. They will lose some collector value if you restore them. Maybe just have the upholstery professionally cleaned and see if you can find a way to contact Jens himself for some history. Good luck.
Mid_Century,39zixh,riomx,5,Tue Jun 16 01:59:56 2015 UTC,Exactly the kind of thing I needed to hear! Thank you for that and the idea of contacting him!

Mid_Century,39zobb,Dr_Adequate,3,Tue Jun 16 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"My house is a 1959 ""likeler"".  The wiring goes on the roof and then through the ceiling.  You'll find the wiring in a groove in the tar and gravel, covered with a v-shaped metal conduit with more tar and gravel on top.  Probably doesn't have a ground wire.    On one of the Eichler blogs, I saw someone do a repair to one of these lines.  They basically had to dig into the tar and excavate the line out and then run new line, and recover it."
Mid_Century,39zobb,hazeldazeI,2,Tue Jun 16 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"This is a picture of my dining room lamp.  It's connected to a j-box that's installed in the ceiling.  The ceiling is a tongue-and-groove ceiling as you'd find in a classic Eichler.    There's something wrong in the wiring, and the lamp no longer works.  So where are the wires between the switch and the j-box?  All I can figure out is the builder routed out a groove from the top (outside) of the roof, then laid the wires in the groove, and applied the roofing material (torch down) over that.    So next I'm guessing that if that's correct, it'd be impossible to snake out the old romex and pull new in.  Replacing the wires will involve pulling up & replacing a section of roof... Is that correct?"
Mid_Century,39zobb,ComputerEntgineer,3,Tue Jun 16 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"You'd be correct.  I have the same type of ceiling in my house and recently had the roof replaced.  All the material above the tongue and groove wood comes off and there's a groove the wire runs in on the top side of the wood (according to the roofers, I didn't see it but I asked them if it was there).  Try contacting an electrician that specializes in rewiring older homes.  Assuming the wires not glued in place (I doubt it), they might be able to do something."
Mid_Century,39zobb,asad137,2,Tue Jun 16 13:47:33 2015 UTC,Are you sure that what you see from inside the house is directly below the roofing? Is there no roof insulation in an Eichler-style house?
Mid_Century,39zobb,hazeldazeI,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"Eichler-style homes have vaulted post-and-beam ceilings with tar & gravel roof directly on top.  No attic space, no insulation.  As an extra special bonus, the house is built on a concrete slab (no basement) so doing any sort of wiring, plumbing or running ducts (no AC or ducted heat) is a real challenge.  I am in the middle of renovating one now, and I need to think really hard about all the things I need to run through the roof before I get my roof done.  Additional lighting, bathroom fans would be nice, and a vent for the kitchen, etc."
Mid_Century,39zobb,Woolio,2,Tue Jun 16 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, no insulation- I had a bathroom fan installed a couple years ago, and I saved the cut-out section of roof where the roofer installed the exhaust hood on the exterior."

Also the red books the soldiers are showing to the ""nazi/fascist capitalists"" are associated with the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong's attempt to save face in the mid to late 60s after his epic policy failure the Great Leap Forward, that resulted in the death of millions of people by starvation.

Mid_Century,39g77d,F-That,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:41:27 2015 UTC,There was one of these for sale locally for $40 and no one would buy it. It was posted for sale forever. I think they had to drop the price to $20 to finally get it sold. And then I see them posted on instagram in NYC for $250 each. I dont get it. I personally did not want to buy it because they are not my favorite looking chair and I had no need for a desk chair. It would have just got dusty in my basement.
Mid_Century,39g77d,edgestander,2,Thu Jun 11 22:47:16 2015 UTC,Yeah in the northeast good cheap stuff is rare so this was a good get for me. I have had much nicer stuff but I just thought this was kind of a cool find.
Mid_Century,39g77d,riomx,2,Thu Jun 11 23:27:48 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. Good snag.
Mid_Century,39g77d,edgestander,2,Fri Jun 12 11:59:34 2015 UTC,"Just do you know I was not bagging on the chair or your find. This is just a crazy thing I have noticed with different markets. Some places like NYC and LA will pay top dollar all day long for those chairs, but in SLC its like no one knows how cool they are or the story behind the designer. Drama started in your post and that happens to get the train derailed, but that doesn't take away from the awesomeness of finding shiny toys with Knoll tags."
Mid_Century,39g77d,riomx,3,Fri Jun 12 22:06:44 2015 UTC,And you have too much getting dusty already!
Mid_Century,39g77d,edgestander,0,Fri Jun 12 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Thanks for your contributions. Also, read your post again -- someone comes here to celebrate an acquisition and the first thing you tell them is how common and difficult to sell the chairs are.  Perhaps you need to take a look at your own attitude and how you come across to others. This isn't the first time you've reacted negatively to being called out about your posts."
Mid_Century,39g77d,paulkersey1999,2,Thu Jun 11 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"Ok.  yeah it's not the first time I (or many of us for that matter) have reacted negatively to one of your posts.  I don't know of any others where I reacted negatively?  I was not trying to insinuate that he couldn't sell it, it didn't sound like he was looking to sell.  I simply said that they were fairly common and an accurate price expectation.  Isn't that the exact type of info most posters are looking for.  Crap I lead off with how much I like the chair, which I do. So I can't throw out a value for a chair, but you critisizing my price on one item, that I happen to really like, that's 100% ok and not negative."
Mid_Century,39g77d,Woolio,0,Fri Jun 12 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is that just because you buy and sell furniture doesn't mean that everyone does. Not everyone comes here to get valuations or to get advice for flipping. That's your own assumption.  Some people just come to hang out and celebrate their finds with others who are like-minded and have the same interest in mid-century modern design and furniture that they do.  The poster even said themselves:   Uuhhh yeah guys I didn't post it as something that was crazy rare or valuable. I wasn't thinking of it as investment, I was thinking of it as a cool desk chair for my office. The designer went to my alma mater and I have always kind of liked I don't care if it's worth anything."
Mid_Century,39g77d,riomx,3,Fri Jun 12 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what.  I have way more to do than come on here and have a mod basically pic fights with me.  Not that anybody cares, but am just going to stop posting or helping anybody.    Now for my retort.  Its funny you say I sell furniture.  While I have a handful of pieces of furniture currently for sale, I actually have not sold one single piece of furniture in my life. LOL I sell smalls all the time, but furniture doesn't ship well and I don't like selling on Facebook or craigslist. I am only looking to sell stuff because I have a pile of furniture that rivals /u/f-that.  Who is making assumptions now.  I'm sorry I feel giving accurate info is valuable and worth sharing.  I did not say anything personal to OP.  Plus the post you quoted was aimed at you and I, and was after I posted my original post that you took offense too.   I saw these chairs that I am familiar with and I thought I would share my knowledge.  If this were a chair that I did not see listed and sold regularly I would not have commented on the value (unlike you who commented on the value of my item without any data to back you up).  I am glad that people come here for the reasons I stated.  Honestly that is why I am here, and why I go out of my way to comb google look crap up for people. Not that I am arrogant enough to think people care.  I guess I will just go back to lurching.    I am extremely grateful for all I have learned, all the nice people on here.  Thanks for everybody that has helped me ID an item or has contributed positively to anything i have posted.    riomx you are a special kind of asshole, as far as I can tell you contribute next to nothing to this board except some critical negative responses then accuse others of the same.    So adios to everybody but riomx, and riomx you can eat a big fat turd."

Mid_Century,398ge8,bvkeys,5,Wed Jun 10 13:37:29 2015 UTC,"That's an Adrian Pearsall table, or a very good copy of one.  I'd say you did good for $175.  Does the open side still have the metal retainer in it so you can plant something in it?"
Mid_Century,398ge8,bvkeys,6,Wed Jun 10 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's probably a copy, so $175 is a decent, leaning towards ""score"" price. I've seen so many of you assholes in here get absurd $20 deals on furniture that I can't call it a huge deal."
Mid_Century,398ge8,bvkeys,4,Wed Jun 10 04:48:11 2015 UTC,"Do you mean at the base? It does t have a metal retainer, so that's possibly missing?"
Mid_Century,398ge8,F-That,3,Wed Jun 10 02:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I mean in the base.  It may have been plastic, I don't remember off the top of my head. It's not a big deal though.  You can call it a magazine rack instead."
Mid_Century,398ge8,F-That,6,Wed Jun 10 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"Even the seller thought it was a magazine rack, thanks! I'm going to try replacing the planter and putting succulents in I think."
Mid_Century,398ge8,bvkeys,4,Wed Jun 10 12:18:13 2015 UTC,"No problem!  They make a few variations of that table too.  Theres a few on eBay right now asking between $300-800 for them.  There's also a matching end table on there, but it's an ebony finish instead of walnut. Also, I know I mentioned it might be a good copy, but for the most part, anything that looks exactly like a Pearsall design like your table, is typically accepted as an original Pearsall design.  This doesn't go for everything, especially chairs, but I would be confident calling yours an original Craft Associates/Adrian Pearsall table."
Mid_Century,398ge8,F-That,3,Wed Jun 10 13:29:33 2015 UTC,Yes they were for plants. It would look something like this.   https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c7/89/e4/c789e439c797e0772fbf1b73b40d7fce.jpg
Mid_Century,398ge8,friendofelephants,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this was Pearsall. Looks like his style, but I have not seen this on the list of authentic Pearsall pieces."
Mid_Century,398ge8,mullacc,3,Wed Jun 10 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm almost positive this is Pearsall.  He could email Jim Pearsall and pay him $50 to verify that if he wanted to.  There is a ton of stuff that Adrian Pearsall designed that is not in that list you linked to.  It's incomplete.  It's a nice resource, but not nearly all of it.  It also doesn't include any of the many variations of each piece he made.  I'm sitting on and looking at three different Pearsall designs at the moment that have all been confirmed to be authentic Craft pieces, none of which are the exact same as what's in that link.  As for the finish, it looks like some finishes of his pieces I've seen, but at the same time, somebody could have refinished it at some point in the past."
Mid_Century,398ge8,bvkeys,3,Wed Jun 10 21:08:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I would save my $50 and not give a shit at that point. Maybe if I was a dealer and was going to flip it.  I think I own a  Pearsall sofa but it is also not listed but i'm not going to pay $50 for Jim to tell me if its real or not.  There is just something about this table that I don't believe to be craft associates. Maybe i'm wrong. Never cared to research it more I guess.
Mid_Century,398ge8,tallread1,2,Wed Jun 10 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"It does look like this:  http://www.causeafrockus.com/2013/11/adrian-pearsall/  And resembles this (although with five ""branches"" touching the glass instead of six):  https://www.pinterest.com/pin/74450200063125484/  Have no idea if it is a reproduction or not though.

Mid_Century,396h2i,Imissbillhicks,6,Tue Jun 9 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"That seems high.  I just had a modern welded metal fence installed, it was only about 100ft though. $1200.  If it's teak or cedar some of the cost might be the wood.  I would get one or to more estimates.  Custom work always costs more. Good habit to get at least three estimates.  Ask for a breakdown of materials and labor so you can better assess.  Good craftsmanship is worth it."

Mid_Century,396h2i,Misha80,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"I would never give a client a labor/materials breakdown, that's the start of a lot of headaches."
Mid_Century,396h2i,nanofarm,3,Tue Jun 9 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"Good to know.  I've done a lot of work on my house over the years.  For custom stuff like this I will ask for an average hourly rate and what the board foot cost of the lumber is.  It's good to know this kind of stuff so I always ask out of curiosity.  Never had anyone refuse to break it down before.  I should have been more clear however, don't not expect them to count nails just give a rough idea such as 80% of that is labor and the wood is pretty cheap(for example). If a large portion is materials cost You might consider changing materials instead of canceling the whole project.  This sort of discussion is often in the contractor's favor. Edited autocorrect errors."
Mid_Century,396h2i,Misha80,3,Tue Jun 9 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'll do it pretty much as you're saying, broad strokes.  I would never provide anything like that on an estimate or quote though.   People that want a breakdown like that always leads to either them wanting to provide materials, or monitoring the hours worked on the job and then trying to haggle after the fact.      I don't mind a little hand holding, especially on a larger job, but it's pretty much ""This is the price, take it or leave it."".  Politely of course.     Comparing labor rates just doesn't tell you much usually, locally we're quite a bit higher than anyone else as far as hourly rate goes,  but our quotes are always competitive because we work faster than anyone else."
Mid_Century,396h2i,nanofarm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely.  Skilled contractors have overhead and deserve to be paid for their time.  I have no respect for a shady contractor that tries to take advantage of someone but I also have no respect for homeowners who try to haggle down someone's wage.  I see homeowners taking advantage of labor more often than I see them getting scammed.  Wanting to earn a living wage is not a scam.  Sorry that was a rant.  I can see how you wouldn't want to break it down like that, it does open you up to haggling.  This hadn't occured to me, I was thinking it's good to have the information as to why the estimate is high.  Sometimes there is a good reason and it never hurts to ask rather than passing on someone that will do the better job.  Cheaper is not always better but there are some guys out there that ewill toss the highest number they think they can get without a good reason backing it."

Mid_Century,396h2i,untbunny,3,Tue Jun 9 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"I had a traditional 5 ft Cedar fence with a gate and maybe 120 ft that was $2200.  I'm sure that style is a little more expensive depending on materials, but the construction itself just looks like taking the vertical boards and making the horizontal.  What type of wood is it?"
Mid_Century,396fpu,themorningmoon,7,Tue Jun 9 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"flood of comments making puns about taking Eames chairs out on a date  Anyways, the parchment shell appears to be a very early production, like you guessed. Probably pre-1959. The second shell, however, was probably made 1989, since that particular HM logo was designed in 1988. I say 1989 and not '88 because the fiberglass Eames shells were put out of production in 1989 by Herman Miller, and I have some 1988 shells with a different logo (the typical one). Hope you find what you're looking for, and great chairs!"
Mid_Century,396fpu,yourmommo,5,Tue Jun 9 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"Well, they are sexy chairs...  (Trust me, I braced myself for the puns. I welcome them.)"
Mid_Century,396fpu,yourmommo,2,Tue Jun 9 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I'm glad to hear I was on the right track with the parchment one :)   I think I'm even more confused about the green one now, though, because this site dates the lowercase Helvetica logo to 1960. Now I don't know what to think! I'm fine with just enjoying it as a pretty chair, though."
Mid_Century,3941ql,friendofelephants,4,Tue Jun 9 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"1st Dibs prices are often at least twice the typical market value of something, usually even more than that.    You are gonna take a hit in the value of that book case with missing shelves, but they're just two rectangular pieces of wood.  I would research it and get two pieces cut that are the same wood, most likely walnut, and try to match the stain.  It's not very easy, but then it's closer to original.  I've seen this somewhere with glass shelves too I think, though I'm not sure if that was a standard option but probably much easier to deal with. Either way it's a nice find."
Mid_Century,3941ql,bvkeys,3,Tue Jun 9 13:06:29 2015 UTC,Good to know about 1st Dibs! Thanks.
Mid_Century,3941ql,ccritter,3,Tue Jun 9 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"I found this after searching Kipp Stewart and Drexel. Even though I doubt it's the original look, I kind of like it: http://www.machine-age.com/our-collection/sold/bookcase-by-kipp-stewart-and-stewart-macdougall-for-drexel/ . I don't think it would take much to replace the non-existent shelving with a glass alternative you were interested in doing such."

Mid_Century,394776,GoldStubb,3,Tue Jun 9 03:27:58 2015 UTC,I picked this up recently at an auction and am having a hard time finding it anywhere. It very well may be from Sears but maybe not!  The springs are eames style clearly but that is where my arm chair knowledge ends. Thank you in advance for looking
Mid_Century,394776,yourmommo,6,Tue Jun 9 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"I think the chair appears to be a common knock-off of higher-end Danish pieces, and it was probably made in Yugoslavia or America. Nevertheless, it is still worth something. I don't see anything that is Eames style though!"
Mid_Century,394776,yourmommo,3,Tue Jun 9 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"I thought the spring pattern was eames style,  but again, this is way outside of my comfort zone. Thanks for the info.  Decent $3 spent?"
Mid_Century,394776,glasgow015,3,Tue Jun 9 03:53:54 2015 UTC,Definitely decent $3 spent! I would have picked it up too. Great find!
Mid_Century,394776,F-That,3,Tue Jun 9 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty common way that springs are configured and is certainly not specific to Charles and Ray Eames, in fact I can't think of a single piece of Eames furniture I have ever seen that has springs like that. I am almost certain that chair was made in America by a mid level manufacture, you can tell by the quality of the wood and how square the legs are."
Mid_Century,394776,edgestander,3,Tue Jun 9 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"The arms remind me of Folke Ohlsson for DUX, but the legs throw out that idea. Also the DUX chair has different straps and cane for the back.  So really its just the arms. Good luck hunting."

Mid_Century,3918xi,bahrieinn,3,Mon Jun 8 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"Well deep gouges will make restore difficult. I live in the Midwest and you can easily find these tables for $10-$50 in the condition you describe. Fully refinished they sell for about $150 around here. The are pretty easy refinish, people around here do it all the time.  For most it only takes a hour or two."
Mid_Century,3918xi,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for the informative response. That helps a lot, especially since I'm also in the Midwest so its good to get a feel for local market prices."
Mid_Century,3918xi,F-That,4,Mon Jun 8 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"I would not pay more than $20 if I have to put any work whatsoever into them. Honestly, I would not spend much on Lane Furniture to begin with unless its more rare or an original style that just happens to work in my home. If you keep your eyes open, you should be able to find one that does not need refinishing for under $100."
Mid_Century,3918xi,edgestander,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% except I just wouldn't put any lane furniture in my house.  With that being said, I think in the Midwest the lane stuff sells really well.  People around here LOVE the acclaim series stuff. I think that Midwest buyers are generally novices that just want to ""fit"" with the style and Lane is a name they know and trust, with a style that has that mid century look without being to daring."
Mid_Century,3918xi,F-That,4,Mon Jun 8 19:03:20 2015 UTC,I have one in my home and its because I like the way it fits with my chairs and its the only one I have ever seen in this style.   http://i.imgur.com/onRYeqG.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/0NEYxnU.jpg
Mid_Century,3918xi,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 8 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"That is nice, I have also never seen that.  I passed on one of these a while back at auction for like $70 I think. If I bought that I couldn't have afforded the Kofod Penguin I got later in the auction."
Mid_Century,3918xi,F-That,2,Mon Jun 8 22:00:52 2015 UTC,I see those pop up from time to time. Good job grabbing the Kofod though. That was a good decision. I have a Kofod lounge chair that I am holding onto until I can find a place to put it.
Mid_Century,3918xi,edgestander,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw your post earlier.
Mid_Century,3918xi,glasgow015,2,Tue Jun 9 00:36:04 2015 UTC,I have some Lane furniture as filler pieces. For example I have that exact table pictured as a bed side table which I will replace when I get around to doing the bedroom furniture. I bought it for $6 though and wouldn't have looked at it twice for $70. Lane stuff is visually appropriate and well made but certainly should not be expensive. Here in the northeast it is crazy what people try and get for Lane stuff.
Mid_Century,3918xi,Janununuh,2,Wed Jun 10 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"Oh my, that is a gorgeous setup."
Mid_Century,3918xi,riomx,3,Tue Jun 9 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm hoping this would be a not too crazy first refinishing project. Feel free to debunk this possible naÃ¯vetÃ© as well.."
Mid_Century,3918xi,didnotwanttoregister,2,Mon Jun 8 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Lane Acclaim tables are great candidates for first time projects, especially because they were so prolific.

Mid_Century,38uobm,Moos_Mumsy,7,Sat Jun 6 23:52:36 2015 UTC,I think it's in the style of karl springer but the inlay on the top of the table in your picture is not conducive to the stream lined nature of a true Karl springer table so it leads me to  thinking it's not authentic.
Mid_Century,38uobm,thoriginals_wife,5,Sun Jun 7 01:56:00 2015 UTC,Designer or not those are some nice tables.
Mid_Century,38uobm,ItsMilkAndEggsBitch,2,Sun Jun 7 08:58:03 2015 UTC,"I agree.  If I had a place to put them in my little house I would have grabbed them right away, but I really have no space for them so I was only going to grab them if I thought I had a chance to sell them for some big bucks and maybe go on vacation this year."
Mid_Century,38uobm,untbunny,2,Sun Jun 7 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"IMO they are not Springer tables.  I can't locate an example of one of his scroll tables with an inlay.  Plus, the side and base of the scrolls appear a bit too bulky and ""boxy"".  However, if they are your style, then by all means snag them.  Free is always wonderful if you like it."
Mid_Century,38si6p,tomatuvm,13,Sat Jun 6 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think you should get it professionally redone, and not by just anyone; by someone who knows what it is and what the value is. Edward Wormley pieces are highly valuable and if resorted wrong a lot of that value could be lost. Fantastic find by the way, I would be so psyched! Good luck!"
Mid_Century,38si6p,yourmommo,6,Sat Jun 6 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This was the argument with my wife -- I think it's worth having done right and she wants a project. Im voting to keep the projects to the cheap stuff, but she's not convinced its that valuable.  I wanted to be able to show her some outside opinions as well.  Still can't believe my luck!"
Mid_Century,38si6p,Misha80,7,Sat Jun 6 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"$3000 seems unlikely, I've sold these in better vintage condition for $500-$750.   You might be able to get $1000 or a little more if it's really well upholstered, and that means spending more on the covering you use.     Make sure the tag stays intact if it get's recovered, and if you are interested in selling the paper tag, I might be interested, or just Ebay it.     There's really no harm (IMO) in letting your wife do it, the upholstery is already shot, so she's not going to negatively effect the value if the whole thing needs redone anyway, it just might not add any value if she does a bad job :)"
Mid_Century,38si6p,pg043,2,Sat Jun 6 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ha and this is her argument!  No way its worth that much and well, it was literally in the dumpster yesterday so anything is better ;)  Specific value aside, I just think it's worth having done right --- we'll see if she can convince me of her skills to do it right (she is a small animal surgeon and claims she was going to go to furniture upholstery school if vet school didn't work out, so she knows how to sew at least!)  Ill let you know if I part the paper tag (feel free to PM an offer)."
Mid_Century,38si6p,Woolio,4,Sat Jun 6 14:49:01 2015 UTC,Life Pro Tip: Let your wife do what she wants ;)
Mid_Century,38si6p,kittycatcate,3,Sun Jun 7 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's furniture upholstery. Worst case scenario, if he ever wants to sell it, he can have it stripped down and redone by a professional and make back whatever it's worth in the market."
Mid_Century,38si6p,kittycatcate,7,Sun Jun 7 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"I like the chair, and I REALLY like that sink.  I would kill to have a sink like that in my kitchen.  I vote you put it in when you do your kitchen remodel!"
Mid_Century,38si6p,SARASA05,3,Sat Jun 6 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The problem is the kitchen remodel may or may not ever happen. It's one of those ""maybe in 3-5 years"" type of things. Which is why I'm thinking i'll probably just sell it so someone can actually use it now instead of it just sitting around in my basement.  I love it though."
Mid_Century,38si6p,SARASA05,4,Sat Jun 6 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"Somebody would pay good money for that.  Cast irons sinks are the bomb.  The ""farmhouse sink"" thing is super in right now too.  I bet you could get like $2k for that.  Even the small farmhouse sinks at Home Depot are like 1.2k new."

I can get the real deal for $300-400 around here so I would say $100-$200, but value is very fluid and location driven.

It's depressing to me that artifacts like this are disappearing.    Not long ago after much Internet sleuthing I discovered that the couch my siblings and I referred to as the ""green banana couch"", and watched TV on, and fell asleep on during lazy weekend afternoons, was designed by Adrian Pearsall (although it was properly referred to as a  ""gondola sofa"").  The only one I found online had been reupholstered in a horrific purple fabric, was missing the cushions, and selling for nearly $6000.  It's just depressing.  I wish my parents had kept it.  I wish all parents would keep the things their kids will grow up only to remember."
Mid_Century,38d9xm,externality,4,Wed Jun 3 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree. I tend to make a lot of my own furniture. I want it to be something My great grandkids could use if they wanted. Jim told me not to let go if the sofa I have for under $9,000 if I'm going to sell it"

Mid_Century,38d9xm,edgestander,2,Wed Jun 3 19:39:02 2015 UTC,So the same table then? Yes clearly one inspired the second. I wonder how they get away with it in the first place?
Mid_Century,38d9xm,edgestander,3,Wed Jun 3 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"The first one I posted is Vladamir Kagan and the second is Pearsall.  Pearsall  himself did a lot imitating.  Plus he wasn't known for the highest quality of craftsmanship.  Unless you copy a design verbatim then patent laws don't provide a lot of protection.  Now selling a product that infringes on a trademark even if you slightly change the name, is very enforceable.  I believe this was brought to the supreme court over Coke, and the many imitators that sold soda called Coca-Nica (just an example) in script letters.  The courts ruled that though they were not directly infringing on Coke's trademark they were intentionally causing confusion in the marketplace, there bye causing damage to Coke's trademark.  I would say that is what is happening here, but with Lane being the copywriter holder, it gets tangled."
Mid_Century,38d9xm,edgestander,2,Wed Jun 3 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that. I didn't do enough research to know that Lane bought out Pearsall. How can they claim anything to his furniture then? Is it because he sold the company name, but not his own?"
Mid_Century,38d9xm,edgestander,3,Thu Jun 4 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would say that is it exactly.  They can rip off craft all they want, if lane doesn't care it's no big deal.  But to even use Pearsall's name starts getting into murky waters, at least the way I understand these things."

Mid_Century,38d9xm,Woolio,3,Wed Jun 3 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"To your last point - it's really a case by case basis. It's absurd that Eames designs (for example) are sold for what they are, as they were not created to be luxury goods. Adjusted for inflation an Eames molded plywood dining chair cost about $300 in 1945 - about the same as your slightly more high-end entry level furniture such as Blu Dot. Today that same chair is like $700 from DWR. So I have no problem with people knocking off DWR designs because I think it's crap that they're selling mass-produced items that were yesterday's CB2 for luxury prices."
Mid_Century,38d9xm,riomx,4,Wed Jun 3 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that Eames chairs have always hovered around their current price point. In the 60s, they sold for $50, or around $300 USD today when you adjust for inflation.   The difference between then and now is that furniture was expensive and well-built back then. A good armchair would run you $200 then, or over a grand today. There wasn't an IKEA or a Walmart churning out cheap, mass-produced stuff, so Charles really did produce an affordable product. ""Affordable"" has just moved over the years.   Herman Miller's not ripping anyone off on the shells. I can't speak to the Lounge or otherwise, however.   (As for the DCW, wood is more expensive now than it was in the 40s. Walnut has gone up almost 300% in the past twenty years, and the Rosewood they used to use is now completely unavailable. A sheet of veneer big enough to face a DCW would easily run over $200, and the plywood it sits on isn't cheap either.)"
Mid_Century,38d9xm,Misha80,2,Thu Jun 4 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"Well no, the low end of the plywood dining chair is now $700 - though it had been an adjusted $300 for many years. I'm sure there are fluctuations in material costs, but nothing that would double the price. I mention Blu Dot and CB2 because they are really comparable to what Charles and Ray intended at the time - stylish, long lasting, affordable furniture for the middle class."
Mid_Century,38d9xm,edgestander,2,Thu Jun 4 02:37:09 2015 UTC,Are we talking about the same Blu Dot? Because a lot of their dining chairs are $500+ per chair.
Mid_Century,38d9xm,1YearWonder,2,Thu Jun 4 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"CB2 might be a better comparison, but I just looked at the Blu Dot catalogue the other day and they had chairs for $300.  Edit: clarified"
Mid_Century,38d9xm,Woolio,3,Thu Jun 4 04:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think CB2 is a better comparison. I also want to take a step back and think about just how silly it is that we're considering $300 dining chairs affordable for the middle class. Because, let's be honest, there's humor in that.   My dining chairs were about $50 each, and we sit firmly in the middle class. I'd really hesitate to drop over a grand on dining chairs, wouldn't you?"
Mid_Century,38b64y,edgestander,5,Wed Jun 3 02:06:47 2015 UTC,https://www.etsy.com/listing/234066774/rare-unique-splash-icicle-cobalt-blue?ref=market  It seems this type of bowl is called a splatter or splash bowl. I found this etsy posting with a google image search.
Mid_Century,38b64y,esthershair,2,Wed Jun 3 04:54:49 2015 UTC,Lol that's my posting.  I think I am going to take it down cause I don't really want to sell it.
Mid_Century,38b64y,riomx,3,Wed Jun 3 12:51:35 2015 UTC,"$100 for a glass bowl you can't identify?  If it comes down to it being an original work worth a significant amount, that's great. But this is the type of glasswork that any artisan with skill can make."
Mid_Century,38b64y,riomx,-1,Thu Jun 4 00:04:47 2015 UTC,Like I said I don't really want to sell it.  If hey eyebals on my store then so be it.  thanks for the unsolicited advice!  I'll be sure to ask you before I price anything from now on.  I'll go mark it down to $5.99 since anyone can make it.
Mid_Century,38b64y,jukranpuju,5,Thu Jun 4 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"Love the sarcasm! You're only wasting your energy though, because I'm not the least bit offended.  If you can sucker people into overpaying for simple things, more power to you. However, if you're putting things up for sale, you open yourself to criticism, especially if people know you're marking up way too much.  I'm a seller of furniture, decor and vintage audio. I tend to price things according to actual value. I've never needed to mark things up too much, but then again I don't have operating costs or overhead, so I tend to sell quick and I'm not always concerned about profit.  EDIT: And also, I never said that anyone can make it. I said any artisan with skill can make it. I'm from Mexico and come from a culture saturated in artisan and craft work. You can buy artistic and elaborate glass pieces for Pesos. Sorry if that somehow offends you."
Mid_Century,38b64y,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 4 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot more than that to offend me, but it's like you aren't hearing what I am saying:( Ok so I have plenty of things, some of them I price for a quick sale or sell on EBay auctions. I also have things that I like and enjoy, but would also sell for the right price."
Mid_Century,388gmp,JCMoxie,3,Tue Jun 2 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"Man, i would love them. I'm defintely in the market for some glassware."
Mid_Century,388gmp,tyrer,2,Tue Jun 2 17:02:29 2015 UTC,Sorry the guy had them sold before me
Mid_Century,388gmp,tyrer,2,Tue Jun 2 18:49:18 2015 UTC,Thanks anyway.
Mid_Century,388gmp,Turbo7MN,3,Tue Jun 2 18:57:11 2015 UTC,I'm in if tyrer doesn't take them. Thanks!  Edit: I also don't necessarily need all of them - even a couple would be cool.
Mid_Century,388gmp,F-That,2,Tue Jun 2 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry, They were sold"
Mid_Century,388gmp,externality,3,Tue Jun 2 18:49:28 2015 UTC,I cant tell but im not sure those are Dorthy Thorpe or not. The Dorthy Thorpe glasses are real silver and they are usually tarnished a little unless someone takes the time to polish them. I like the ones that have the brushed silver look to them.   The glasses I want the most are the Georges Briard with the lions on them but i'm not paying a fortune on something to hold my cheap whiskey.   http://imgur.com/64EPp3C
Mid_Century,388gmp,Turbo7MN,4,Tue Jun 2 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"Nice...  On another note, I wish it were possible to even mention mid-century without throwing in a reference to Mad Men...  Mid-century was a thing before Mad Men..."
Mid_Century,388gmp,externality,9,Tue Jun 2 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, in this case these glasses are identical to ones that were actually on the show. I do agree in general though."
Mid_Century,388gmp,Turbo7MN,0,Tue Jun 2 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Oh wow... OK.  I've never actually seen it.  :-)
Mid_Century,3851jk,Beardedkid,8,Mon Jun 1 22:21:23 2015 UTC,From someone also subscribed to r/diy - thanks for not screwing this up. Good job.
Mid_Century,3851jk,macrossmaster,2,Mon Jun 1 23:47:45 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Mid_Century,3851jk,Learned_Response,5,Tue Jun 2 02:25:54 2015 UTC,Nice! The refinishing of the wood seems straightforward. What did you do with the upholstery?
Mid_Century,3851jk,animalistics,4,Tue Jun 2 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"I used a toothbrush and a cleaning solution called ""kleen warrior."""
Mid_Century,3851jk,animalistics,4,Tue Jun 2 02:20:17 2015 UTC,"Very nice. I do lots of these small, low-cost refinishing projects. Could you give us a summary of what you did and what finish you used? Looks fantastic."
Mid_Century,3851jk,bidoville,5,Tue Jun 2 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"This was a very easy project. I disassembled the chair, which was easy just held together by screws. I sanded the wood down and I'm lucky to have some vintage danish oil stain. I used a medium walnut. Then finished the piece off with Howard's feed and wax. The upholstery I used a toothbrush and a cleaning solution called kleen warrior and elbow grease."
Mid_Century,3851jk,djallball,2,Tue Jun 2 02:24:24 2015 UTC,Feed-N-Wax is great stuff. Thanks for the summary!
Mid_Century,3851jk,besthuman,2,Tue Jun 2 03:48:56 2015 UTC,Awesome work!
Mid_Century,386p2x,Beardedkid,5,Tue Jun 2 06:17:03 2015 UTC,"Always makes me sad when someone removes the original lacquer and then polys it with those ""glow in the dark edges"". I have a very specific stain brand I use to try to replicate that tinted and colored lacquer they used to use...but overall, good catch!"
Mid_Century,386p2x,macrossmaster,3,Tue Jun 2 12:11:17 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing the stain you use?
Mid_Century,386p2x,macrossmaster,3,Tue Jun 2 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"No problem! You have to order it from Home Depot I think. Its Varathane American Walnut. They won't have it in store, but it's worth the wait. I can try to post pictures later. The Varathane darkens up the edges more, but you can still tell they are two different tones. The original finish played down the differences in tone better, but it's very hard to replicate. The American Walnut stain does make a very attractive finish however without the ""glow in the dark"" effect. I've redone three tables with it and a third is awaiting the treatment, but I've been lazy."
Mid_Century,382v29,sadinternet,3,Mon Jun 1 13:32:23 2015 UTC,"clearly it's not Folke Ohlsson for Dux, but it looks similar.  EDIT: I should say, it's clearly not the same sofa as the one I link to. Maybe it's a different model by Dux or Ohlsson."
Mid_Century,382v29,mullacc,4,Mon Jun 1 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Good call.  I did some image searching, and may have found it.  However, the one posted appears to be missing a middle leg.  EDIT: not the exact same, but the dimensions check out."
Mid_Century,382v29,Misha80,2,Mon Jun 1 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"I have Dux catalogs at home, I'll look this evening."
Mid_Century,382v29,JustWiggl3s,-10,Mon Jun 1 18:12:21 2015 UTC,Doesn't look mid century to me
Mid_Century,382v29,yourmommo,13,Mon Jun 1 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"I think it definitely is mid-century modern, because of the clean lines and the tapered Danish legs (they're probably teak). I would say country of origin is Denmark but I have no clue on the designer."
Mid_Century,382v29,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 1 14:59:13 2015 UTC,Really?  I labeled it Danish Mid-Century by the profile of the cushions and legs.  What makes you think it may not be?
Mid_Century,383i8g,Beardedkid,3,Mon Jun 1 16:19:23 2015 UTC,Somewhat similar to vintage sofas by Dux
Mid_Century,383i8g,yourmommo,3,Mon Jun 1 20:51:13 2015 UTC,https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/6160078    Pretty similar to this no?  My first thought was Pearsall or some imitation.
Mid_Century,383i8g,edgestander,2,Tue Jun 2 03:50:59 2015 UTC,"It is close, I thought the arm inserts would be an identifying mark. Yet they have not matched to anything I have found yet."
Mid_Century,381w0h,friendofelephants,5,Mon Jun 1 06:42:04 2015 UTC,Looks like a modern knockoff to me.
Mid_Century,381w0h,edgestander,2,Mon Jun 1 11:49:28 2015 UTC,:( Was hoping it would be something older since it came from a house with lots of mid-century furniture (Eames and other pieces selling for a quite a lot).
Mid_Century,37yxl5,cookehMonstah,5,Sun May 31 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"these are freaking awesome. Hate the fabric, but the structure is excellent. Jealous"
Mid_Century,37yxl5,thoriginals_wife,4,Sun May 31 23:08:58 2015 UTC,Oh those are sexy chairs indeed.  Good eye. I actually like the fabric as well.
Mid_Century,37yxl5,jmanassero,3,Mon Jun 1 03:12:56 2015 UTC,Those are very special - nice find!! Do you know the designer? They look similar to Louis van Teeffelen designs.
Mid_Century,37yxl5,friendofelephants,3,Mon Jun 1 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"No, they don't have any name on that. The studio where I bought them said they didn't know either, hence the low price."
Mid_Century,37yytj,mullacc,2,Sun May 31 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"This was such a stylish period, can anyone tell me the big catalyst that moved style away from MCM?"
Mid_Century,37yytj,motherofkatana,2,Mon Jun 1 11:38:33 2015 UTC,"The set designer was Carlos Barbosa, his website has more material.  Ike runs the Miramar Playa hotel from this office. It's the only space that has the mid-century vibe that I like. The rest of the hotel is more Miami Beach-style glitzy.  Magic City had a 2 season run on Starz from 2012-13. It's on Netflix streaming now. The first has been pretty good, IMO."
Mid_Century,37yytj,and_ampersand_,3,Sun May 31 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"My eye was immediately draw to the cheap chinese Charles and Ray Eames aluminum group knock-offs. The fact they employed the cheapest chair possible, instead of the real deal, lessened everything else for me.  Anyone who knows MCM design would instantly spot the differences in one of the most iconic office chair designs ever produced."
Mid_Century,37yytj,riomx,2,Mon Jun 1 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"I also noticed this when I saw an episode in which some of the filming took place showing the office. It definitely broke the suspension of disbelief, but it's because I'm so familiar with the line that it's one of my favorites and I can spot the chairs easily from afar."
Mid_Century,37yytj,riomx,-2,Mon Jun 1 20:44:17 2015 UTC,You don't have to be an asshole about it.   How can you tell they're cheap knock offs?
Mid_Century,37yytj,and_ampersand_,3,Mon Jun 1 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"Herman Miller chairs almost always had aluminum finish (there are variations with black tubing) and the horizontal lines on the leather or fabric were sewn (there were later models that used mesh, though).  The knockoffs made by the popular reproduction sellers have a chrome finish. Also, the legs on the base are ""fat"" and shaped like animal balloon legs."
Mid_Century,37wiha,musrep99,7,Sat May 30 23:58:30 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure but they don't appear mid century . They look more modern. Is there any tags or stamps on them to help identify where they were made?   So me they look like restaurant surplus but I could we way off.
Mid_Century,37wiha,thoriginals_wife,5,Sun May 31 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm running around making dinner for the kids, but I'll post more picture after dinner. :) I know that there from 1964, the lady I bought them from told me she bought them when she moved into the house with her husband. I took the fabric off one of the chairs and it had shiny green vinal under it. No tags but there is writting that I'll take some photos of!"
Mid_Century,37wiha,opabiniarex,4,Sun May 31 01:19:40 2015 UTC,"Heh, shows how much I know then. I definitely like the green more."

Mid_Century,37umkh,dark_stream,19,Sat May 30 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"I will decrease the value, and will make some people angry, but it's yours - if it'll make you happy, go for it.   I did something similar with an old stereo console cabinet - my components are inside the old speaker sections so the remotes work through the speaker mesh.   Think about airflow though. You need more than just cable holes - you need air circulation. I took the entire back off mine."
Mid_Century,37umkh,chzplz,5,Sat May 30 17:16:33 2015 UTC,Decrease the value is an understatement with a piece like this. It will basically do a flying elbow drop on the value. It's definitely OPs right to modify it but it still makes me sad.
Mid_Century,37umkh,OnlySlightlyEvil,17,Sun May 31 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"Are you nuts to modify that beautiful piece of furniture? Yes, I think so.   Honestly, I'd look for a decent vintage media cabinet to upgrade."
Mid_Century,37umkh,itoddicus,10,Sat May 30 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"Why don't you buy an old Credenza that has vintage stereo equipment, and update those components? Sometimes the old equipment still sounds really good, and you can re-use the holes and mounts."
Mid_Century,37umkh,awd3495,2,Sat May 30 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"I bought an old record player and it sounds incredible, and looks great. If you wanted to, I'd just buy a record player and set it on top of that. It would fit the period."
Mid_Century,37umkh,Woolio,7,Sat May 30 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think you would be making a mistake, but it's your mistake. Just don't expect to make your money back if you ever sell it.  That said, you can buy vintage stereos cheaper than ever, why not go grab one of those and retrofit it? It certainly seems more suited for the task."
Mid_Century,37umkh,vincent_vancough,5,Sat May 30 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"I think it could only decrease the value to collectors. They only care about how original something is.   However, it may be more marketable to a different type of audience. I personally would like seeing a vintage piece altered to fit modern living. I want my furniture to fit my decor and not be an obstacle to my lifestyle. I happen to have and enjoy a lot of stereo equipment.   But all of that depends on whether or not the credenza is finished on the rear and how well the cable management grommet is installed. If it looks like it was made that way, you're golden."
Mid_Century,37umkh,Woolio,2,Sat May 30 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that first part goes without saying. However, the general public who's just looking for a piece of furniture wouldn't ever pay anything near collector's market prices, so he's effectively shutting himself out of whatever it would actually be worth. A piece like this would go in the general market for a few hundred bucks, but I see them regularly go for thousands to collectors.   It seems like a stupid decision all-round, but I can't tell him what to do. If he wants to destroy it, it's his property. But he should be aware of the consequences, at least."
Mid_Century,37umkh,ButabusRT,4,Sun May 31 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"Is the back finished? If so, it'll hurt the resale value, but life's too short to care that much about material goods. Do whatever you think works, I think it'll look awesome."
Mid_Century,37umkh,Woolio,3,Sat May 30 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Before you do anything else, I'm going to give you a number. Your credenza, without the top part, sells for $3000.  Do you want to toss $3000 into your fireplace?   If not, then don't modify it. If you don't care about destroying $3000, then go ahead."
Mid_Century,37umkh,F-That,2,Sun May 31 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you are saying it will be worthless with a small hole in the back and that is not correct. I bet with a hole that is done clean and not a hack job, he can still get $1500 - $2000 for a piece like this depending on where OP is located."
Mid_Century,37umkh,Woolio,3,Mon Jun 1 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Depending, but yeah, that sounds about right. He won't be getting top-dollar from collectors, but he could probably sell it for around what it's worth."
Mid_Century,37umkh,macrossmaster,3,Mon Jun 1 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yes because period stereo gear looks fucking excellent and shouldn't be hidden. Put something like a Fisher 400c and Thorens TD-124 on top of that and they will become aesthetic centerpieces. Those two are expensive options, but there are many much cheaper options with the same aesthetic. Don't hide attractive stereo gear -- turn them into furniture pieces"
Mid_Century,37umkh,triplereversechicken,4,Sun May 31 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"Short answer, yes. You are taking care of this till the next person in my view (cue responses about how I'm wrong). Do you really want to be the one who jacks it up? At least chalk paint can be stripped.   And let's be blunt: I've seen SO many abominable DIY jobs in r/DIY that statistically speaking, this is gonna look like crap.  Again, just my opinion, let's not light up my inbox with how wrong I am."
Mid_Century,37umkh,vincent_vancough,2,Sat May 30 23:21:59 2015 UTC,Can only agree with what's already been said- that's a beautiful piece of furniture in great condition. So many stereo cabinets out there you can do that with instead.
Mid_Century,37umkh,triplereversechicken,3,Sun May 31 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I think he likes the credenza he has and doesn't want it to scream ""Stereo Cabinet!""  He wants to disguise his stereo and hide it in a more glamorous piece of furniture."
Mid_Century,37umkh,vincent_vancough,3,Sun May 31 03:32:22 2015 UTC,Makes sense- I've been on a similar mission and stereo cabinets exist that look very similar to the bottom portion.  It's really the additional top portion that sets this piece apart.   That being said it would be super cool looking - just looks like such a beautiful piece of furniture and as someone else mentioned mods/diy never turn out as good as they should.  BUT if executed correctly would be a cool one of a kind piece soooo... I'm torn!
Mid_Century,37umkh,F-That,2,Sun May 31 11:40:57 2015 UTC,You could practice on an old throwaway piece of furniture or take it to a professional perhaps.
Mid_Century,37u7rq,Digitaalex,3,Sat May 30 12:50:40 2015 UTC,It looks terribly uncomfortable with those two bars right in the middle of the back rest.
Mid_Century,37u7rq,edgestander,2,Sun May 31 14:14:46 2015 UTC,Thought so too. The guy who sold them also wanted 450â¬ for it so NVM

Mid_Century,37u578,roma9880,7,Sat May 30 12:21:43 2015 UTC,Looks like inexpensive American mid century from the 60s
Mid_Century,37u578,didnotwanttoregister,5,Sat May 30 21:23:25 2015 UTC,Looks period to me.  It doesn't look like its teak though.  It appears to be maple.
Mid_Century,37u578,bluedj18,6,Sat May 30 21:21:08 2015 UTC,It's cute! Good find. Put some nice plants on top of it.
Mid_Century,37u578,SARASA05,3,Sun May 31 20:49:26 2015 UTC,I need something exactly like this to hold my turntable and records. Very cool piece.
Mid_Century,37u578,F-That,4,Mon Jun 1 14:47:40 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I bought this! It fits everything perfectly and looks awesome.
Mid_Century,37u578,Svenhook,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:11:06 2015 UTC,Also very jealous. This is exactly what Im hunting for. Congrats!
Mid_Century,37u578,thoriginals_wife,2,Tue Jun 16 04:45:26 2015 UTC,I'm torn on this cabinet because the legs look authentic but the trim on  the top looks modern. I'm going to say reproduction but it's a lovely cabinet and for what you paid you did well.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,jvlpdillon,8,Fri May 29 23:16:15 2015 UTC,The green fixtures would look really cook in a grey bathroom.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,burrgerwolf,3,Sat May 30 04:37:44 2015 UTC,Can confirm.  I have that toilet and bathtub and grey walls.  Looks great.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,primarynode,4,Sat May 30 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think the tile is a little overboard, but the fixtures themselves look cool. What kind of flooring do you have? That's the biggest trouble I'm having, what would work? maybe white or grey tile?"
Mid_Century,37s5bz,burrgerwolf,2,Sat May 30 17:49:51 2015 UTC,My floor is hideous at the moment.  It is linoleum parquet pattern.  Looking into very light grey tile.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,primarynode,5,Sat May 30 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"Beautiful!  White everything's is so bland.  I have the same tub in my house, but the sink and toilet are long gone.  Someday soon, these baths etc may have some value they way original Victorian fixtures do now."
Mid_Century,37s5bz,nanofarm,2,Sat May 30 20:24:58 2015 UTC,Check Ebay. I saw several similar pieces. This was just local to me.

We found vintage wallpaper in an almond shade with metallic cross hatching.  All together, it is tied together while still subdued a bit."
Mid_Century,37s5bz,123middlenameismarie,11,Sun May 31 18:56:33 2015 UTC,I have a nice American standard set it pink if anyone is near Pittsburgh and interested.  We will be remodeling and this set has to go.  In most cases I like to keep original especially if they work but I really struggle with pink.  I don't even wear pink.  I am not a fan.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,chzplz,7,Sat May 30 03:43:52 2015 UTC,Post it on save the pink bathrooms and it might find a loving home...
Mid_Century,37s5bz,riomx,2,Sat May 30 09:51:15 2015 UTC,I don't blame you. I wouldn't be able to live with a pink bathroom either.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,Roxxer,3,Sat May 30 04:41:54 2015 UTC,A little bit too much green imo.   Having white fixtures would make it a lot nicer.
Mid_Century,37s5bz,supercruiser,3,Sat May 30 06:48:35 2015 UTC,Beautiful! The house I grew up in had a pink bathroom with silver trim.. I loved that place.

Mid_Century,37pz1e,F-That,2,Fri May 29 14:51:39 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the info! I looked it over pretty good looking for any sign of who made it and didn't see anything.. I'll check again when I get home though. Is there anything else I can look for that can help tell me who made it? I don't really care a whole lot since I plan on fixing it up a bit and loving it.
Mid_Century,37pz1e,F-That,5,Fri May 29 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"Taking a second look at it, I don't think it is Selig. The legs are a little too bulky and don't mold into the frame like most of their other chairs. When you get home, take off the cushions and look very closely for any markings at all. Sometimes they wont have one but if you are lucky, you will find something to get you started."

Mid_Century,37hoos,edgestander,2,Thu May 28 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"Look, the business of making/collecting vintage pulls so that the five people in the world that might need them can have them is not going to be a lucrative one.  Most of these shops don't keep that stuff and if they do they use it for themselves.  Seriously broyhill dude just needs to comb craigslist, auctions, the side of the road, for a junky brroyhill set that you can get for just the pulls.

Mid_Century,37c4j1,stolenbaby,3,Tue May 26 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Very similar proportions to an authentic set, but with hardware visible and a 5-star base on the lounge chair = most likely a late Selig chair.  Also, it looks like someone has either repaired or attempted to change the angle of the tilt with the wedge on the bottom. After a few looks, that's probably why that center post broke.  You can buy replacement bases here and there are installation instructions: https://www.swivel-chair-parts.com/EamesPlycraftAvailablepart.html  I've restored a Plydesigns chair (almost identical to later Selig chairs, but with a 4-star base on the chair), so if you have any more questions, I'm happy to help.  EDIT: I also noticed that your chair doesn't have mounting screw holes for the cushions on the chair or ottoman -- do you know if they are mounted with clips?"
Mid_Century,37c4j1,riomx,5,Tue May 26 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"Also, it looks like someone has either repaired or attempted to change the angle of the tilt with the wedge on the bottom.   This is the first thing I noticed too. I think the original base broke and they added the angled block to make the angle correct instead of fixing it."
Mid_Century,37c4j1,Suppafly,2,Tue May 26 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think the wedge is original, like in this photo:http://www.swivel-chair-parts.com/Catalog%20resources/PlycraftWedge-Large.jpg  They say:   This original mechanism instead used a wooden wedge to set the tilt angle. It has a 5/8"" dia. spindle and there is not an available replacement. The mechanism and base must both be replaced if either the base or mechanism is replaced as shown in photo at right.  So I guess I'm up a creek as far as keeping the original tilt mechanism and a new base... aw well.  Thanks for looking into it for me!"
Mid_Century,37c4j1,Suppafly,2,Tue May 26 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"Good find. I'd never seen one with a wedge originally, but I'm not super well versed in them.   It really depends on how far down this rabbit hole you want to go. I've looked at this site a few times in regards to office chairs and always concluded it'd be easier to get a new chair, but for a lounger, it'll probably be worth the hassle to fix it. If the spindle is removable from the tilt mech, you could have a shop turn down the end to 5/8"".  I wonder if they've just decided that 5/8"" isn't a size to carry for safety reasons or something. They have adapters to go from 1"" to various other sizes but nothing under 1""."
Mid_Century,37c4j1,riomx,2,Tue May 26 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"I would keep it. The chair itself is in excellent shape. Repairing the new base or getting a new one is the least of worries. If the plywood on the lounge chair seat was broken, that'd be a whole other story."
Mid_Century,37c4j1,Suppafly,3,Wed May 27 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I haven't yet pulled off the cushions- I'm hoping there are clips, but we'll see.

Mid_Century,37c4j1,riomx,4,Tue May 26 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's what you can buy from www.swivel-chair-parts.com if you buy the tilter only, it's the tilter and the post. I'm pretty sure the original tilter was broke, which is why someone added the angled block."
Mid_Century,37c4j1,riomx,3,Tue May 26 17:45:28 2015 UTC,www.swivel-chair-parts.com   Good call. I'm hoping some day I find a ratty Plycraft or Selig that needs a base repair. I want to see how hard it is to replace broken tilt mechanisms.
Mid_Century,37c4j1,Suppafly,2,Tue May 26 17:48:12 2015 UTC,Take it to a welder. It's possible that it can be repaired.

I bought a piece there for what I thought was a fair price. Especially considering it was the kind of thing (a entry hall chest) that I haven't seen much of outside sellers like Mobler that ship stuff from Denmark."
Mid_Century,3784v2,mullacc,2,Thu May 28 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yes - the owner finds beautiful things, but they are one of the most pricey in the Bay Area. I just thought it was odd of you to make a thrift store treasure trove relative to a designer furniture import warehouse. It just takes away from the fact that this guy came upon a gold mine."
Mid_Century,3784v2,Woolio,1 point,Sat May 30 07:41:19 2015 UTC,Not a thrift store. Not a treasure trove.
Mid_Century,3784v2,nasadowsk,2,Sat May 30 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"Check the prices on those reel-to-reels, and look them up on eBay. Some of them can be worth a lot of money."

Mid_Century,375y6d,Stepfanie,4,Mon May 25 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's gorgeous. I would love to see the after photo, once you're done."

Mid_Century,375y6d,kittycatcate,4,Mon May 25 12:01:20 2015 UTC,You should also hit the arms and legs with a little steel wool followed by some danish oil.  I can tell the wood will clean up really nice.
Mid_Century,375y6d,riomx,3,Mon May 25 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. Other than being filthy, the wood is in great shape. I think the lady said it has been in storage for at least 20 years. She owns a former upholstery shop that I think her mom ran plus two other buildings full of stuff."
Mid_Century,375y6d,kittycatcate,2,Mon May 25 14:14:07 2015 UTC,"It looks a little dry, but I guess it could be the photos. Either way, a little Danish oil wouldn't hurt. It would make it look more vibrant and reconditioned."
Mid_Century,375y6d,IgnoreAmos,2,Tue May 26 04:08:42 2015 UTC,Howard's Feed and Wax is a great product too.  The combo of Danish oil followed by Howard's is a good one.
Mid_Century,374m7q,PrioriIncantatem,4,Sun May 24 20:52:49 2015 UTC,I have some of these too! They smell like vomit though. I would kill for the third one with all the Eames seating.
Mid_Century,374m7q,yourmommo,3,Sun May 24 21:15:44 2015 UTC,Those would be awesome framed with a dark color behind them.  Very cool find.
Mid_Century,3735jl,edgestander,4,Sun May 24 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"I got this chair at auction for $2 last week.  I had this fabric that I had gotten on sale at Jo Ann's for about $14.99 a yard, it is a wool/cotton blend.  I used about two yards for this. So $30 in fabric.  I was going to use the old foam and batting, but Jo Ann's  had a sale, 50% of foam and batting this weekend, so I sprung an extra $30 for new HD Foam and batting.  So all in about $62, I learned some things not to do, and some things that worked.   Once I got a game plan and got working it only took me about 1.5 hours."
Mid_Century,3735jl,ButabusRT,2,Sun May 24 13:02:32 2015 UTC,That looks pretty good. Any advice for someone attempting this?
Mid_Century,370nw9,cioppinochle,2,Sat May 23 19:38:16 2015 UTC,I took a look at it. Its the terrible brown color from the 70s/80s and there is no ottoman. If anyone is still interested its at 2315 Lincoln Ave at Redux.

Mid_Century,36s4z6,Misha80,3,Fri May 22 10:30:23 2015 UTC,"Would be cheaper by far.  The National Park Service has a preservation brief on aluminum windows, I don't have the link on me, but you should be able to Google it."

Mid_Century,36ptju,absolutebeginners,6,Thu May 21 17:57:20 2015 UTC,Thanks! Been lurking on this sub for a while now. Figure I'd chime in.
Mid_Century,36ptju,absolutebeginners,7,Thu May 21 18:10:58 2015 UTC,How much did you spend on your 5 fake chairs?
Mid_Century,36ptju,riomx,4,Thu May 21 15:32:20 2015 UTC,Only the lounge is fake.
Mid_Century,36ptju,yourmommo,2,Thu May 21 17:10:55 2015 UTC,Right but you said    Fifth knock off I've had over the years.
Mid_Century,36ptju,riomx,5,Thu May 21 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry about that. First Plycraft I picked up for around $75. Second one I couldn't identify was about $120. Third Plycraft I had was $100, and the last one I restored was unknown. Bought it for $75 and put about $80 into it. Plus this latest one for $550 (new). So all in, about $1000."
Mid_Century,36ptju,yourmommo,3,Thu May 21 18:05:03 2015 UTC,Wow thats fairly cheap. What was the quality like? Shitty I imagine if you needed a bunch of them?
Mid_Century,36ptju,F-That,6,Thu May 21 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"Newest one was 25% off at the time. So a pretty sweet price. It's solid. Obviously not as comfortable at the real thing, but nice. The first 2 were sold when I had to move back to Canada. I traded one for some web design work, and I sold the fourth to help cover the cost of the new chair. That one had some structural issues, but was a great chair for the nearly 5 years I had it."
Mid_Century,36ptju,F-That,4,Thu May 21 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Here's my Aluminum Group side chair, which I also got for $125 from the second owner.

Mid_Century,36mz4v,macrossmaster,2,Wed May 20 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"I am wanting to order one (especially as it says it is leather), but my bad experience with a very uncomfortable fake leather Eames Aluminum group chair has made me skittish. Is this thing actually going to be comfortable or not? Anyone have one?"
Mid_Century,36mz4v,softcore_robot,2,Wed May 20 15:54:35 2015 UTC,I'm not against replicas. But the one thing that I've seen more than anything is the leather flakes on the replicas. It's a cheap synthetic leather you find on Chinese made stuff. It may help to ask what kind of leather the chair is made from. You'll get a year of use before flaking starts.
Mid_Century,36mz4v,softcore_robot,2,Wed May 20 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"They are giving the usual ""Italian leather"" description, which does sound good, but I just can't imagine it being that great. A further question on Amazon's page for it indicates the Italian leather is on the portions you sit on, whereas the back of the chair is a different leather made to match but not as soft and quality intensive. I guess there's no real way but to try it and see. Someone out there's gotta have one..."
Mid_Century,36mz4v,riomx,2,Wed May 20 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"This company is probably a reseller, you might find the distributor of you dig more. Or other seller with reviews. If it was $100 then different story, but $400 with shipping isn't worth it. Looks small btw."

Absolutely one of my top five houses around  here.  Here are some vintage pictures you might find interesting: https://carlgraffunder.wordpress.com/2010/07/04/graffunder-with-a-tile-twist/
Mid_Century,36il2g,Turbo7MN,5,Tue May 19 18:42:54 2015 UTC,That explains why there is so much tile. It's kind of ridiculous.

Mid_Century,36il2g,kittycatcate,5,Fri May 22 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"What a sensational house!  I'm glad the second owners kept it original and that it stays that way.  But that snow.  I lived in central Oregon for a couple of years and don't think I could live with snow and ice again.  I've been getting used to Arizona.  Hot, for sure, but you don't have to shovel air conditioning.  Plus solar panels work great down here and summer nights are lovely.  Though my cats would be pretty happy about the heated floors."

Mid_Century,36il2g,toddmp,2,Tue May 19 23:08:47 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if a house were in the higher end of the market or a model home, and interior photos would sell it, they would use a professional photographer, who would probably use Kodachrome or Ektachrome.  Otherwise, it would probably be an exterior photo at best,or just a listing. Developers might have their brochures illustrated.  In between, they just did not HDR, just good enough film or early digital photography."

Mid_Century,36hpbk,riomx,10,Tue May 19 15:34:42 2015 UTC,Not an Eames.
Mid_Century,36hpbk,heavymetalsculpture,5,Tue May 19 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"That is more than likely an Overman chair. They were based in Sweden and made many similar styled lounge chairs in fabric and vinyl. I have one myself. It was the chair that got me into collecting MCM pieces.  The aluminum base gives it away, they used the same base on almost all of their chairs. The structure is styrofoam, making the chair surprisingly light."
Mid_Century,36hpbk,and_ampersand_,3,Wed May 20 01:09:29 2015 UTC,Its an Overman for sure made in Sweden there is a sticker on the bottom. I searched the google news archive and saw an add for one in 1967. The selig mentioned below looks similar so I am not sure who is copying who. I guess its my poor mans Jacobsen chair.
Mid_Century,36hpbk,edgestander,-3,Wed May 20 13:50:10 2015 UTC,Well what is it classified as? Danish MCM? Looks like it takes its roots from the Arne Jacobsen egg chair - which I think is considered Eames. In any case its cool to me even if its a mass production knock off to the purist.
Mid_Century,36hpbk,edgestander,8,Tue May 19 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"Eames refers to Charles and Ray Eames who were designers and architects in California.  It is not design style. This is MCM, but not Eames. I wouldn't say this is a knockoff because it's not exactly copy any iconic design. I would say this is more in Milo Baughman style than Eames."
Mid_Century,36hpbk,strong_grey_hero,3,Tue May 19 17:18:26 2015 UTC,Thanks then Danish MCM or Milo Baughman inspired works for me. In any case my cat loves it and so do my friends - My mom says its a Mork and Mindy chair.
Mid_Century,36jrn4,sennheiserz,2,Tue May 19 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"Looks like they are on sale now.  Out of my price range though still at $1,000.

Mid_Century,36jrn4,edgestander,2,Wed May 20 05:24:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, apparently just missed that sale...oh well"
Mid_Century,36jrn4,zubidooo,-2,Wed May 20 21:02:44 2015 UTC,either you work at Rove Concepts or clearly misinformed. Rove gets their furniture from the same factories in China as other companies. Stop spreading lies and rumors about other companies and embellishing your Chinese made replicas.

Here's a picture of my chair, in my room with my username and yours, in case you care.  http://imgur.com/tfehIw8  However in fairness, they may still MAKE them in china, but I don't believe they are from the same SOURCE that sells to many of the lower priced sellers of these chairs.

I'm not trying to offend you...I just often think about how I want a completely black cat and a completely black dog, and then I feel weird and superficial. But I really want a black cat and a black dog.   Could be an appropriate question in a sub, where people flock who like things that ""look good"" :)"

Mid_Century,36ecsa,Veloci_Rapture,2,Tue May 19 14:00:35 2015 UTC,"Swear to Dog, I did not- she was actually gifted to me (re-gifted?) by my ex. She had been a gift to my ex some years past and after our mutual departure she had taken our cats (I didn't feel myself ready for pets alone) and then asked if I'd take Miah (her official name) after she moved, re-married, and bought large dogs. Meem dislikes dogs and started acting up, so she booted her out.   She has been my furry roommate for about a year now. But doesn't she look good? Even if unintentionally? I swear she knows. It's funny how it worked out like that. Ex and I had a Bengal cat, too, who also looked quite fine on the Eames sofa (unfortunately, neither of which I retained in my departure!)."

I grew up with Siamese as a kid and now have my first one ... and its not because he looks ""cool"" - well some think he looks like a rat. Siamese are an old breed and have unique personalities much like a dog. They fetch, talk, come to their names and are very athletic. I've never seen a regular cat do this but all the siamese I have been around have these characteristics. I guess its bred into them over 1000's of years we've had them as pets. I may get a shelter cat as a companion in the future."

There's one small scratch on the ottoman from another cat my ex and I had- she jumped from my shoulder and I spent most of the day trying to find her with a squirt bottle. I think both learned from that, or at least this one did.   Most of my friends know that shoes and mid-century furniture don't mix. They get the spray bottle treatment, too."

Mid_Century,36cwq4,classicsat,4,Mon May 18 17:23:41 2015 UTC,It was all Alexander Girard. This house was a major influence on design for several decades. Girard did a lot for the Miller family.
Mid_Century,36cwq4,Bjorn74,3,Mon May 18 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"You do because of how extremely influential this building is to the design industry. I've been on the tour and while I agree, the design looks somewhat non midcentury in photographs however in real life it is not that way at all. It's supremely stunning."
Mid_Century,36cwq4,howard__roark,2,Tue May 19 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"That whole collaboration is just stunning. Everyone knows it as Saarinen's house, but without Dan Kiley's design extending the lines and without Girard adding the custom touches like the rug with stylized references to family history, a wall of hidden storage and display, and seasonal cushions for the conversation pit, it's just an unlivable box that looks a lot like the bank Saarinen designed for J I Miller. And somehow Kevin Roche ended up developing a strong connection with the Millers through this project which resulted in him designing so much more on his own in Columbus than the 4 Saarinen buildings (3 Eero, 1 Eliel) after father and son passed away so close to each other.  Another thing that makes this iconic is the tulip chairs which were designed for this house and then became wildly popular."
Mid_Century,36cwq4,Bjorn74,3,Tue May 19 10:47:04 2015 UTC,That carpet seat cushion combo looks awesome.

Mid_Century,367cpf,edgestander,3,Sat May 16 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"Ok so here is the whole story.  I have been going to this guy's estate auctions for a few years, usually I am a bottom feeder and kind of buy the boxed lots and sprinkle in some nicer stuff I know about.  I saw this auction come up on tuesday with the auction today, and I saw the  Penguin and the Milo Baughman, neither were attributed to their designers.    Now flash back a week or two ago.  I mentioned to poor little Ohio MCM Facebook group that I was going to make a Milo /not Milo like my Mid Century vs. MCM post.  So in researching I saw that barrel back chair and thought, WOW that might be my favorite Milo chair.    I knew instantly when I saw it in the listing.  All week I have been thinking about, with no one to really tell that got the magnitude, but also wouldn't be a rival.  So I waited 3 hours for the auction to get to the furniture.  The Nanna Diezel was sitting there off to the side AND WASN'T in the online listing.  So I bid on it and got it first, for $140.  There was a lot of mid century crap (as brass and rosewood would call  it) to wait through, but then they got to two 90's Eames DCM chair.  In great condition I sat in my Diesel and watched.  They sold for $400 I don't think the resale can be over $500 in Columbus...sucker.  So it gets to the penguin.  At $50 everyone bails but me and one guy.  We bid it up to $200, and boom its mine! Success.  Now I knew I would get that chair, it is exactly what I planned to spend!   So the Baughman comes about 10 items later.  Would other people know?  I have been telling myself all week it is going to go for like a thousand, truth is I can't go higher than like $400, especially after I snagged the Diezel.  The bidding starts with lots of people.  Everyone loved the chair.  But did they know?   Ay $150 , I jump the bid to $200, everyone is gone but me... and the guy who bought the Eames chairs.  Hum, he doesn't know, no way.  How deep are his pockets, he has bought a lot of the junk!  $300, godamnit I go $325.  He thinks at $350, but strikes.  I bid $375 immediately.  He shakes his head and turns.   Boom all in at like $720 I got three amazing pieces.  Funny how the one piece I knew I could afford and I wanted, I probably got the worst deal on, but I am not complaining."

Yes I am like 99% sure mine is. if the walnut wraps around in three pieces connected by tounge and groove then yes yours is too. I don't think any one would ""knock off"" this design because it would be cost prohibitive.  From what I can tell these are probably from the early 60's.  These are very rare! Milo Baughman Wide Barrel Lounge Chair seems bring the best search results. I'm in Columbus any chance we could work out a trade for it?  I would love to have it."

They painted the walls and ceiling white (they were probably paneling before, as are most Eichlers), and stuck a concrete wall and grilling area out back. Everything else aligns pretty closely to the stuff I've seen in Dwell since the early 2000s, and it lines up pretty well with modern and mid-century architectural concepts.   I'd say they managed to stay true to the home while bringing it up to speed. It's leagues better than some of the Eichler remodels I've seen."
Mid_Century,35xeu8,Woolio,3,Thu May 14 23:10:51 2015 UTC,Totally. It's not like they put in trendy stuff like Travertine tile or something. Clean and modern has a way of staying clean and modern.

Mid_Century,35nllh,yourmommo,4,Mon May 11 23:45:51 2015 UTC,Any details on the process you followed and your experience during the restoration?
Mid_Century,35nllh,riomx,5,Mon May 11 23:59:54 2015 UTC,I just basically followed this guide by Plastolux.
Mid_Century,35nllh,Woolio,3,Tue May 12 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"How difficult was it? I've got a seafoam shell I want to restore, but haven't gotten a chance to yet."
Mid_Century,35nllh,ryspot,3,Tue May 12 04:05:14 2015 UTC,"It was pretty easy, I think it took me 30-45 minutes of work. I just had to wait for the shell to dry after cleaning it and applying penetrol."
Mid_Century,35nllh,awd3495,3,Tue May 12 13:58:56 2015 UTC,Looks great!  I had a similar great experience with Modern Conciencious. Very easy to deal with and a great product.
Mid_Century,35nllh,ericphilbin,3,Tue May 12 12:28:12 2015 UTC,Looks great!
Mid_Century,35nllh,jaimem,2,Tue May 12 00:15:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm pretty happy with the results.
Mid_Century,35nllh,Ottorange,3,Tue May 12 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"Those look great, thanks for sharing.    I'm so happy; I have an old bowling alley Eames style seat (reclaimed from a TV show set, believe it or not) that I've been sitting on (well, not literally) for years. Now I know how to mount a base."

Mid_Century,35nllh,Moominsean,2,Tue May 12 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the white shells are a little more difficult. I have a parchment one and it will not get glossy no matter how much I try."
Mid_Century,35mtn4,alexmet,6,Mon May 11 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/riomx, that credenza is definitely custom. I collect midcentury modern carpentry books, there were definitely people who built their own stuff, and this certainly looks the part (and I say that from looking at the top, not the front).   The coffee table looks like it was upscaled, probably someone found an old concrete countertop, flipped it over, and put legs on it. I could be wrong about that, I'll get back to you if I ever see anything else like it."
Mid_Century,35mtn4,Come_To_r_Polandball,4,Tue May 12 02:24:27 2015 UTC,For sure -- thanks! Can you recommend some books you'd consider essential reading about mid-century modern & danish/scandinavian furniture & carpentry?
Mid_Century,35mtn4,edgestander,5,Tue May 12 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"Got anything else for us, like what is the material for the top of the coffee table.  It looks like concrete?  Any tags or stamps, number or marks of any kind?  Was there feet on that credenza.  Neither of these are easily identifiable as iconic design pieces to me."
Mid_Century,35mtn4,yourmommo,4,Mon May 11 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't really give any more information than what's in the pictures. I snapped those photos while my fiance & I were looking for a new place, a couple of months ago and I never got the seller's contact info (or else I'd ask them). What I can tell you is, yes the top of the coffee table is concrete (polished, I think) and it has two recesses on the top. The credenza's feet were those two wood blocks, so I'm not sure if they had original legs before and they broke or got removed."
Mid_Century,35mtn4,yourmommo,4,Mon May 11 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Very cool pieces, but I'm not sure of the manufacturer. That looks like a cool apartment too. Good luck"
Mid_Century,35mtn4,riomx,2,Mon May 11 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I hope I can finally find out who made these beauties. A part of me thinks it may be StyleGarage/*Gus, but I doubt it."
Mid_Century,35mtn4,riomx,2,Mon May 11 21:30:12 2015 UTC,Yes they are very similar to the urban and playful modern that Gus* carries. Tell us when you find out!
Mid_Century,35mepn,IAMTHELEOMAN,3,Mon May 11 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"Reproduction does indeed indicate it is not authentic. And if you're going to reupholster it, there aren't ready-made covers. You can either do it yourself, or find a local shop that can help you."
Mid_Century,35mepn,riomx,2,Mon May 11 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info and link! I viewed it earlier - not authentic sadly.  It was, a really really nice and excellently proportionate version of the Eames Lounger. It had 2 rivets on the base wood and the back wood holding it together so I instantly recognized it as a Selig-style version of the chair, the owner told me they bought it in the 70's for a lot; being sold on the name sadly. She was asking $250 and seemed firm for it, so I decided to let it go, hopefully to someone who will take great care of it. I suggested she hangs onto it, have it restored and enjoy it!  I was hoping there would be new leather covers you could simply buy; so many cars have that readily available, I'm amazed they don't make them for Eames chairs."
Mid_Century,35mepn,riomx,3,Mon May 11 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"$250 is a good price for a Selig in decent shape. If it wasn't in good shape, then it wasn't worth what they were asking. However, I'm personally not a big fan of reproductions with wood backings instead of metal, so I would have passed too.  And nobody makes covers for reproductions because they've been out of production for years and were never ubiquitous enough to warrant manufacturing of aftermarket parts.  You can get replacement cushions for authentic chairs from Herman Miller, but the proportions would be off and you'd pay a lot more than the chair is worth.  Also, did you really think you were getting an authentic Eames Lounge Chair for $250? Haha."
Mid_Century,35mepn,riomx,3,Mon May 11 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"haha you never know what you can find on craigslist! Just depends on if the seller did their research! This selig wasn't in great condition - needed to be completely reupholstered and i did notice a few big scratches on the corner of the ottoman, so I think you'd agree with me for-sure to pass it up"
Mid_Century,35mepn,riomx,3,Mon May 11 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"Btw I got mine for $100, which I was OK with for a project.  This is how it looked when I got it. It was in sad shape.  This is how it turned out when I was done.  If you ever find a cheap one in bad shape and you're up for working on a project, grab it!"
Mid_Century,35mepn,riomx,2,Tue May 12 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"I might have tried to get it to restore, since I've done it before. But only if the seller came back to Earth and accepted that it's not some rare and prized possession that commands hundreds of dollars even in bad shape, like some people think they are.  And the best deal I was going to get on an authentic Eames Lounge Chair was $800 -- a designer was out of work and needed rent money and I was ready to take it off his hands. Unfortunately, you can't pull that much cash out of an ATM at 6:00 PM on a Sunday night and I had to call and let him know it was a no-go."

Mid_Century,35jfd0,punoff,3,Mon May 11 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"http://www.sturdystitchingupholstery.com/sturdy_stitching_upholstery/Portfolio/Pages/Knoll_1305-U.html  This one appears to be similar in that the fabric is glued to the bent wood. I do not do upholstery, I leave it to the pros on the pieces we find that we want to recover. There is a clear difference between their work and what a DIYer can usually do. Good luck, those are awesome chairs!"

Mid_Century,35ild1,darryljenks,3,Sun May 10 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Hans J. Wegner's Y-chair / Wishbone chair /CH24  Hans J. Wegner was born in 1914 in TÃ¸nder, the son of a shoemaker. At the age of 17 he was apprenticed to a carpenter (H. F. Stahlberg) and it was at this time that he developed his first design. At the age of 20 he moved to Copenhagen to study at the institution now known as The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Design but which back then went under the more modest title of ""The Artisan College.""  He studied there from 1936-1938, before taking further studies as an architect. In 1940 Wegner initiated a joint project with Arne Jacobsen and Erik MÃ¸ller in Aarhus, which involved fitting out Aarhus' town hall. It was also in 1940 that Wegner began to work with Master Carpenter Johannes Hansen, a man who played a significant role in bringing modern design to the Danish public. The then Copenhagen Industrial Art Museum (now Design Museum Denmark) purchased their first Wegner chair in 1942. Hans J. Wegner opened his own design studio in 1943, and in 1944 he designed his first ""China Chair"" in a series inspired by the Chinese Emperor's thrones.  One of the chairs in this series is what is probably Wegner's most famous work ""The Wishbone Chair,"" which he designed in 1949, and which Carl Hansen & SÃ¸n have manufactured since 1950. Hans J. Wegner is regarded as one of the world's outstanding furniture designers. He was one of the motive forces behind the Danish Modern movement which did much to change people's view of furniture in the 1950s and 60s. His design retain relevance for us today and his sense for details is a source of constant wonder.  Wegner has received a number of prizes and recognitions. Amongst other things, he is an honorary member of The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and has received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art in London. He was also the first ever recipient of the Lunning Prize and received the 8th International Design Award in Osaka, Japan. His works are exhibited at major international museums including The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and Die Neue Sammlung in Munich.  Hans J. Wegner died in Denmark in January 2007  Hans J. Wegner's contributions to Danish design:  A master carpenter first and a designer second: Perfectly finished joints and exquisite forms.  A deep respect for the wood and its character and an everlasting curiosity about good materials.  He gave minimalism an organic and natural softness.  He is considered as ""the master chair-maker"" and designed more than 500 chairs during the course of his life."
Mid_Century,35ild1,zim2411,3,Sun May 10 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"He also seems to like B&W speakers. That big rectangle by the window is this center channel speaker, the left front speaker is visible in the corner and the right front is off camera. It looks like there's a woefully inadequate subwoofer there too. The full surround sound set of B&W speakers probably runs around $20k. Curiously, there's no screen over the center channel, and the seating is far from ideal, meaning this is a sad display of money that /r/hometheater would chide."

FLW early career was arts and craftsy, but falling water is an example of organic architecture, which includes Eames, serrinen, and many other MCM drsigners.  If you are saying it isn't mcm because it was built in 1935, then I would say is the Wassily or Barcelona chair MCM? Cause they were designed in the 20's."
Mid_Century,354vbn,opabiniarex,6,Thu May 7 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Well, it's kind of the counterpoint to your initial distinction between Mid-Century & MCM. Modern design could be considered the aesthetic, which Falling Waters definitely fits into, but the Mid-Century part of the term is usually defined as 1945-1985 (as I've seen it defined).  Mid Century it would be manufactured between 45-85.  Modern: would have Modern design aesthetics  Mid Century Modern: it would be made between 1945-1985 AND have Modern aesthetics.  I'm not saying that is a hard definition or should be considered the final word, but just how I view the distinctions."
Mid_Century,354vbn,mullacc,4,Thu May 7 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"I would say is the Wassily or Barcelona chair MCM? Cause they were designed in the 20's.   No. They were International Style, another pre-MCM movement.  Anyway, I definitely wouldn't use Fallingwater as the example of an MCM house. The way I see it, MCM was the blending of FLW's organic modernism plus International Style plus post-war exuberance."
Mid_Century,354vbn,mullacc,1 point,Thu May 7 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ok I will agree it isn't the BEST example, still I think if you went to fallingwater and did not know the date it was made, I think most people would call it MCM.  I really think we are splitting hairs when you say things like brutalist and international style aren't part of the greater MCM catch all.  I mean not one single architect or designer refered to themselves as mid century modern.  Eames was an organic designer. Eerro sarieneen was an organic designer.  They collaborated to win prizes for designs in the 1940 worlds fair, so would those designs not be MCM just because they were designed prior to 1945?"
Mid_Century,354vbn,mullacc,5,Thu May 7 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"I really think we are splitting hairs when you say things like brutalist and international style aren't part of the greater MCM catch all.   Well I guess this is the crux of the matter. I don't think MCM is the catch all. I think Modernism is the catch-all and MCM is a narrower concept that blends pre-existing design approaches with a specific time period.  I also think MCM is used and abused too much (as in, exactly the kind of stuff your Facebook foe was doing). I want to keep Fallingwater away from the term because I like Fallingwater."
Mid_Century,354vbn,riomx,1 point,Thu May 7 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"Look fallingwater and international style can be debated as MCM or not, but the point is if this guy were posting things that are debatable MCM I wouldn't have made this post.  I know wiki isn't the best source but it says that MCMis generally defined as 1933-1965.  Plus this: Many consider Frank Lloyd Wright's principal movement of organic architecture combined with Arts and Crafts as an American jumpingâoff point for the aesthetic of Mid-Century Modern. However, one need only visit a Wright house interior to realize the Mid-Century modern movement in the U.S. was really an American reflection of the International and Bauhaus movementsâincluding the works of Gropius, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. Though the American component was slightly more organic in form and less formal than the International Style, it is more firmly related to it than any other."
Mid_Century,354vbn,deepdorp,3,Fri May 8 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this...if you did this exercise over again, are you still going to pick Fallingwater as your example of an MCM house? And not, say, Neutra's Kaufmann House?"
Mid_Century,354vbn,itoddicus,1 point,Fri May 8 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"If you are asking if there are other houses that are more quintessential MCM then yes I agree a Nuetra house would be better, but for the point that I was trying to express I think Fallingwater helps get that across.  My point was this guy was saying anything made in 1950's or 60's was MCM, my point is  with Fallingwater (which is not made in the 1950's and 60's) is it is more appropriate than a 1700's style french buffett.  As I said in a comment on that group.  An Eames lounge bought new today, would be more appropriate for the group than a country style side table made in 1965."
Mid_Century,354vbn,Imazagi,2,Fri May 8 16:32:14 2015 UTC,I guess I just see brauhaus and cranbrook school movements as the seedlings of MCM. People associate most MCM with 1945-75 because that is when mass production allowed these designs to go mainstream.
Mid_Century,354vbn,riomx,2,Thu May 7 21:55:58 2015 UTC,Check this book out if you get a chance. It'll provide much more context about 20th century design movements than is possible here on Reddit:  History of Modern Design: Graphics and Products Since the Industrial Revolution
Mid_Century,354vbn,F-That,1 point,Fri May 8 00:13:24 2015 UTC,My other point would be this: I was just at falling water last month the only free standing furniture in the place is 2 Florence knoll arm chairs and a jens ransom lounge. All the built in furniture also is very MCM.
Mid_Century,354vbn,F-That,11,Thu May 7 20:00:27 2015 UTC,i agree with this distinction between MCM and what i coined MCC (mid-century contemporary). i'm curious though -- what were your 'harassing' actions?

Mid_Century,34zvji,tucshop,5,Tue May 5 23:00:13 2015 UTC,I went with a Hallingdal wool blend by Kvadrat in light grey and am very happy with it. I am not sure the exact designer of the sofa but it is very reminiscent of Jens Risom.
Mid_Century,34zvji,HOOKEMfuckers,4,Tue May 5 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"It looks awesome. How much did it cost to recover, fabric and all? I think a lot of people see sofas with great bones but are scared it'll cost way too much to recover em."
Mid_Century,34zvji,riomx,4,Wed May 6 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"It'll always cost a lot of money to have someone reupholster a sofa for you, because upholstery is an incredibly time-consuming and tedious activity.  However, if you do it yourself, you'd be surprised at how simple it is and how much money you can save. You can take a cheap couch and turn it into something amazing with new fabric and cushions.  The requisite hours of labor and patience aren't for everyone, but if you're willing to take the time to learn and follow through with a project, it's extremely rewarding."
Mid_Century,34zvji,raanne,6,Wed May 6 00:44:46 2015 UTC,I'll add that in my experience the cushions are the part that shows errors the most and require the most sewing. A good middle ground is to do the sofa portion and have a professional do the removable cushions.
Mid_Century,34zvji,riomx,3,Wed May 6 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"The type of upholstery I've done is mostly pulling and stapling and not much sewing. I'm definitely nervous about making cushion covers, but I suppose it's one of those things that you get better at with practice. Also, it helps to have a seamripper and use old cushion covers as patterns whenever possible."
Mid_Century,34zvji,virtuallin,3,Wed May 6 03:08:33 2015 UTC,I went with a more expensive fabric that was much pricier than most others but still got a great deal on it off eBay. Labor cost me $575 and fabric was $400 (17yds.) I wanted to have the flexibility of choosing my own fabric and also to be able to spread out the cost as opposed to shelling out the cash all at once.  I'm sure if I would have done that at a vintage boutique I'd be paying WAY more than what I did for a sofa in a color I didn't love and fabric that was of much cheaper quality.
Mid_Century,34zvji,Chique_Fritz,2,Wed May 6 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thanks! Gorgeous! You've just given me a solid idea of how many yards of fabric I'll probably need to recover my pink brocade couch & loveseat!

Mid_Century,34wlat,yourmommo,4,Tue May 5 13:40:52 2015 UTC,The Beethoven poster was designed be Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann in 1955.

The drawers don't move/ close as well as I expect a Herman Miller version would. But that may be from moving the desk around.  The real reason I like this Modernica is the huge desktop.

I doubt it's by a known furniture maker, as these were just sort of coped from earlier furniture styles and redone in contemporary fabrics.  But, it's an awesome chair and I personally love it."

I really have no idea about its age, and no other subreddit seems up to helping with any identification. There are no identifying labels on the chair. The only issue is that it came from a smoker's house. I am working on airing it out and have placed some bowls of distilled vinegar near the chair (as i found online).  In the end, I really love the look of the chair and the fact that its really comfortable, so identification isn't that important, i was just curious.  If this doesn't fall within /r/mid_century's realm, I apologize, i am new to this game."

I received it from a friend (an upholsterer and furniture restorer who was responsible for designing one of the sets of Gran Turino) who bought it at an estate sale for $40. I traded her some hand knits for it. It is possibly my favorite piece in my home, with the sideboard hutch as a close second. So good to finally know the manufacturer! Much appreciation!"

Sadly the original floors were in such bad shape and would have been too expensive to replace with hard woods, so we had to opt for (cringe!) wood veneer. NOT era appropriate, but hey. Doing MCM on a budget can be tough. It is so great, then, to get a compliment on the flooring!"

Mid_Century,34ks4f,tucshop,14,Sat May 2 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"Backstory: I responded to a local CL ad advertising an MCM desk for sale. I decided to respond even though I wasn't all that into the desk but the pictures promised other nice pieces in the home. After speaking with the homeowners I learned that they were selling the home and slowly starting to part with some of their furnishings so we scheduled a time for me to come and see what they were planning to sell. I am glad I did. Immediately upon entering the home I knew that it was furnished entirely in the 60's-70's and everything was up kept and high end. After taking a lap through the home we dealt on some smaller items and made future plans for some of the larger pieces once the home sold and when they would no longer need it for staging/living. Before leaving I asked to see the patio and I laid my eyes on said EARLY iconic Eames piece which was being used solely to keep dumbbells off the ground... I tried my best to keep my composure and asked as calmly as any enthusiast could about what his plans for ""that chair"" was. Without hesitation he responded ""oh that thing, you can take it with you for free."" So I I grabbed ""that thing"" and high tailed it out of there. :)"

Mid_Century,34k3zk,squeakyballs,3,Fri May 1 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"Looks a lot like Kopenhavn, but I can't say for sure. I have one of their wall units (large and small shelves, no cabinets), and the angles of the small shelves are identical to mine. They are finished with walnut veneer. Not sure about the finish on the one you have photographed. Anyway, below are some more links that you can use to compare and research:  https://krrb.com/posts/116900-mid-century-modular-wall-unit-noral-olson (Most similar to the one you posted)  http://www.montanaprairietales.com/blog/2011/9/19/new-wall-unit.html (More background info on Kopenhavn)  https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3038/3022750138_8cba809f31_b.jpg  http://www.designaddict.com/forum/General-discussion/Danish-Wall-Unit-Mystery-Maker http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3l3BRO9qdoo/TUwgFum7JTI/AAAAAAAAAN0/w9PurauNVpc/s1600/60-06-12+Twin+Falls+Times+News+p.+5+%2528detail%2529.jpg  https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/storage-case-pieces/cabinets/noral-olson-kopenhavn-freestanding-scandinavian-style-unit/id-f_574770/"
Mid_Century,34k3zk,riomx,3,Fri May 1 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"The finish on what you shared is what I've found on lower-priced wall units like those that Khoury made. They usually sprayed film over poplar (which tended to bend or damage easily).  I recommend checking the type of wood the unit is made from. If it's veneer over engineered wood, it'll usually be more stable and strong.  If it's poplar like as with Khoury wall units, mounting holes can be stripped and cabinets will be crooked, there will be dents and knicks that are unsightly, etc.  Poplar is such a terrible wood, but it was cheap."
Mid_Century,34k3zk,riomx,2,Fri May 1 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/bpGp3lT  I've wanted a wall unit forever, have a found one? I can't find any like it on google."
Mid_Century,34k3zk,F-That,2,Fri May 1 21:03:53 2015 UTC,How much are they asking?
Mid_Century,34k3zk,F-That,2,Fri May 1 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm ridiculous, I forgot to ask. I sent a message but haven't heard back yet. I've bought things from them before and everything has always been reasonable ($300 for a bedroom set). So... I'm assuming not too crazy."
Mid_Century,34k3zk,yourmommo,2,Fri May 1 21:58:32 2015 UTC,$400 but would probably take a bit less.
Mid_Century,34k3zk,yourmommo,2,Fri May 1 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"If you really want one then $400 isn't bad. Its not a high quality piece and you can tell by the exposed hinges on the doors and the wood is not teak. $400 is a retail store price on this i'm guessing and $200 would be more of a private seller price. That being said, wall units where I live don't come up that often and when they do they go fast. They are amazing to have and super useful though so I say go for it. I would offer $200-$300 though and see what happens."
Mid_Century,34iecj,iVoid,3,Fri May 1 12:34:58 2015 UTC,My grandpa used to make these all the time! I never really knew they were mid century modern. I just have always associated them with him. Super comfy and aesthetically pleasing though!
Mid_Century,34iecj,Argh_ImaPirate,3,Fri May 1 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"There's basically no way for you to know if it is original or not because they have been so prolifically copied and as far as I know the originals were never marked. And there were really good copies made, too. At this point it isn't so much about whether you have the real McCoy as if you have a good quality piece. These typically are made out of one single piece of thick, high quality metal.   In any case, congrats on the great score. They are lovely and comfy."
Mid_Century,34iecj,tallread1,2,Fri May 1 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. These are made from two lengths of 7/16"" solid metal wire. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the hardoys use two sections of wire aswell, not one continuous piece. I don't see how it would be possible to make it with a single wire. Anyway, I plan on stripping them down with a wire wheel and repainting them. One of them is kinda bent up, so I'm gonna have to try to bend it back and re weld one of the joints. I bought some duck cloth so I'm gonna try to sew up an experimental sling since I have no pattern to go off of. I was expecting to find some kind of template online, but apparently no diy people share that sort of thing."
Mid_Century,34iecj,tallread1,1 point,Sat May 2 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yes you are correct about it being 2 pieces. It's been awhile since I was researching these chairs.

Mid_Century,34iecj,acerani,2,Sat May 2 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know I can get replacement covers through them, and they do look great, but rather than spend $65 per chair, I could easily make my own from less than $5 of canvas."

Mid_Century,34giev,reyp,2,Fri May 1 08:59:58 2015 UTC,It can't be mid century unless it was designed during that period. That's why you can buy an eames chair/table etc newly produced (but same original design) from Herman Miller and still call it mid-century.

Mid_Century,34fy89,riomx,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think the Danish oil turned out great. I love the deep and warm color that it gives woods.  That being said, I also had issues with patchiness the first time I used it. Did you sand when you stripped? That can cause problems in refinishing. If you're going to use Danish oil you have to remove all of the old finish, otherwise the color won't be consistent when you apply it.  With the next chair, try solvent strippers first to get rid of as much of the original finish and maintain a uniform color after. With sanding and because of the variable patterns you create, refinishing with Danish oil can exalt them instead of cover them."
Mid_Century,34fy89,Woolio,2,Tue May 5 02:09:01 2015 UTC,I used a stripper before the Danish oil.  I only sanded when the stripper couldn't get the original finish out of small nooks and crannies.  Thanks for the tip!  I'll be a bit more cautious with sanding next time.
Mid_Century,34fy89,obamapastry,1 point,Tue May 5 03:32:37 2015 UTC,"That's good. Your results turned out better than mine. At least you didn't have these issues on a lounge chair. Someday I'm going to have to refinish mine, but I'm going to wait a few years. It was a lot of hard work that I don't want to do again for a while."

Sort of a ""finder's fee."" You might not be able to fix one up now, but throw it in the basement for a while and you can always have it reupholstered down the road."
Mid_Century,349quc,yourmommo,2,Thu Apr 30 02:35:44 2015 UTC,I already have 2 erkornes chairs and a 700 sq ft house with no basement or attic. There's literally nowhere to put one. And I'd rather support the library anyway.

So far I have stuck with the traditional 900 and 301 (yet to get any 301's). I have read that the 314 series is of a lower quality. The guy is asking 350 for it, which is well above anything I have paid for my last 7 pieces... Any thoughts? Like I have said before, I hate using them, but 1stdibs has one listed for 1600$ which I just find ridiculous."
Mid_Century,348cqx,kevan,2,Wed Apr 29 02:42:15 2015 UTC,Make sure you know the difference between what something is listed for and what someone will pay for it.
Mid_Century,348cqx,yourmommo,2,Sat May 2 07:18:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's an awesome design, much cooler than most Acclaim pieces I've seen, but I would try to go lower than $350."
Mid_Century,348cqx,MsModernity,2,Wed Apr 29 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"I've wanted to ask this question on this sub for a while, so please don't feel I'm attacking you or anything. What's with the obsession (in general in this sub, not you in particular OP) over makers, lines and style numbers? I can see why it would matter to professional collectors/resellers who are trying to make money off of these items, I guess. Is that it? Or is there some other satisfaction is knowing you got some name brand?   I'm not much of a connoisseur but I like a lot of the Danish modern aesthetic. If I see something I like, and it looks in reasonably good shape for not an outrageous price, I get it. But it's never dawned on me to find out the maker, etc. Also keep in mind that I don't have a problem with reproductions or new furniture that's done in the MCM style either. I feel a bit alone in this sub in that way.  Thank you for reading. I'm looking forward to the answers."
Mid_Century,348cqx,MsModernity,3,Wed Apr 29 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"I know that some users here are big sticklers for names and lines, that's just how they shop, and more than likely have the money to shop that way.  Most of the time I could care less on the name brand, I look for quality in the craftsmanship. But the Acclaim series just has a hold on me, I know its not the top of the line by any means, but for a low income 26yo who wants to have quality furniture instead of this new MDF or Particle board shit that falls apart after a year of use, I think it fits the bill, I mean it is 50 years old... and all of my pieces are holding strong.  Also on Lane pieces its just easy to research, they burned the style and serial numbers in the bottom, and the serial is the date it was manufactured backwards... 667050 would be May 7th 1966"
Mid_Century,348cqx,kochunhu,2,Wed Apr 29 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"Nice! Thank you for the reply. Your post sent me around the house, looking for markings on my furniture haha!"
Mid_Century,348cqx,MsModernity,6,Wed Apr 29 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"Designers have interesting life stories and individual styles, and knowing the designer and manufacturer adds to the story of the furniture. For example, I have some family ties to Finland, and this has gotten me more interested in Finnish MCM designers, textiles, etc.  In all vintage and antique collecting, provenance is an important part of the appreciation of the pieces."
Mid_Century,348cqx,Woolio,2,Wed Apr 29 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks!"
Mid_Century,348cqx,MsModernity,2,Wed Apr 29 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"It's just because it's easy to categorize, and you know what you're buying. When Lane was big, a lot of furniture tried to mimic it with particleboard/laminate, but Lane always used solid wood and real veneer. It was a little more high-end, and it lasts longer because of it.   There's nothing wrong with non-branded furniture, and some of it's even built better than the real thing (looking at you, former Soviet Bloc states!), but generally the name-brand stuff is preferred because you know what you're getting.   That's not taking into account some of the collectors we have here, like /u/brass_and_rosewood, who are in this for the sport of it as much the decoration. I'm sure if you asked, he'd tell you all about it."

Mid_Century,345v9y,rodneyachance,3,Wed Apr 29 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"Is this really an optimal setup? Having rows of different chairs? I imagine this could be a problem if this room is used for presentations or whatever, because you would have more people sitting further back as the chairs there are clearly more comfortable? In addition, if I were there and only seats remaining were those in front two rows, all I could think would be how comfortably people behind me are sitting and how my life sucks.  /rant  edit: unless it's temporary, then it would make sense..."
Mid_Century,345v9y,rachie27,5,Tue Apr 28 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"This room is used to show two 15 minute videos introducing the tours they give. Comfort isn't crucial, but the back rows do fill up first. There are as many as 25 people on a tour, so there would be extras most of the time. Honestly, though, they're all just fine. The bigger point is the variety of design in the room."
Mid_Century,345v9y,jefland,2,Tue Apr 28 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"I had 6 people in my tour today. 4 people sat in the Eames Aluminum Group Chairs and 2 sat in the Swoop Chairs.   We have a lot of older folks and college kids in the tours. The older folks want something the can get out of easily. The Swoops look very low and cooshy. They actually aren't, but the older folks tend to choose the chairs in front. The architecture students want to see a lot and so they also tend to want to be up front. The locals like the back because they've ""seen it all"" already and the video just shows what they already know. And for the most part, that's true.  Now that I know what those Swoop Chairs are, I want a bunch of them for my living room. We are lucky to live in a MCM inspired home in an MCM inspired city."

Mid_Century,345hrq,themorningmoon,3,Tue Apr 28 15:55:25 2015 UTC,Nitpick: This is a surfboard coffee table. Needs that ellipsis ellipse shape.
Mid_Century,345hrq,lobster_johnson,3,Tue Apr 28 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"Ellipsis is a punctuation mark (...). You meant ellipse.  If you do a google search for ""surfboard coffee table"" you get plenty of square-edged varieties.

Mid_Century,342asu,Woolio,3,Mon Apr 27 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"See my comment below, but basically, if you're willing to accept a chair that's less than perfect, you'd be surprised what you can afford. Lounges are obviously a different matter (although luck sometimes comes through), but if you're talking about the fiberglass chairs, I would be surprised if you couldn't find an affordable one on Ebay or Craigslist.

(An entire apartment full of Eames lounges would certainly be something to behold, haha.) I sometimes see the highback chairs on Ebay for a halfway decent price - definitely a good thing to save for!  As a side note, I see that you're from Pittsburgh. I love that city. :)"

Mid_Century,342asu,lotrewill,2,Mon Apr 27 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"""Eames Chair"" is probably not an Eames lounger. Eames designed atleast 4 different chairs that got pretty famous.

Of my collection, I think there are maybe one or two chairs that don't have some issue of some sort. Most have holes that need to be patched or small cracks that need to be filled, and I've had to strip the upholstery off of two of them (with one more that still needs to be done). I don't think I've paid more than $150 for any of my fiberglass chairs, and even with the work I've had to put in, it's well worth it!"

I don't think this sub is in any way in danger of getting overrun by memes (or would that be meames?), so I thought a little levity wouldn't be a bad thing.

Basically, what's on the label is all you'll really find. A green velvet chair with matching ottoman of the same brand sold for $100 on eBay a while back. There was an attempt to sell a sofa similar to yours - though it was rosewood and had matching armchairs - for $6,000. It never sold, for that price or lower. It's a great sofa, but nothing you're going to make a huge profit on."
Mid_Century,341kmw,obamapastry,3,Mon Apr 27 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, and it was manufactured in 1973, can't remember if that's on the label or not."
Mid_Century,341kmw,obamapastry,2,Mon Apr 27 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Really appreciate the info. I'm absolutely in love with the couch and not eager or really willing to part with it anytime soon, so it's worth isn't too important to me.  I'm pretty happy with my haul, though. It's addicting, I've been searching ""mid century"" and ""teak"" on craigslist multiple times a day since!"

Mid_Century,33z9p0,JCMoxie,5,Mon Apr 27 01:05:45 2015 UTC,This design has been an online mystery for years. It is characteristically American but exact maker and designer unknown. Many claim it to be Adrian Pearsall but no confirming evidence has been unearthed to prove that. Best of luck.
Mid_Century,33z9p0,tucshop,2,Mon Apr 27 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you, thats more then I have been able to find. There are no markings on the entire Piece. Looking through some of his work, I see why people link that arm style to him. Although I've only seen it as a chair so far."

Mid_Century,33ywqn,bidoville,5,Sun Apr 26 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Odd that both of you have flaps that won't stay up.. there isn't any wood dowel or anything under that you could slide out that would force the flap to stay up? I have an MCM desk with a flap on one side and a 3""x1"" bit of wood slides out and holds it up. LOL   Gorgeous and I'm jealous as I've been looking for something like that for months in a price I can afford. I cannot believe the insane prices folks on CL think they should be able to get! Stinkers! hehe"
Mid_Century,33ywqn,virtuallin,3,Mon Apr 27 07:47:08 2015 UTC,"Nope! I wondered if there wasn't a piece that wasn't attached that had been lost. The table expands, but the thrift I bought these at didn't receive the extra pieces. There's a small ramp/angled wooden piece on the flaps, but nothing slides out or twists around to support it."

Mid_Century,33ywqn,obamapastry,3,Sun Apr 26 23:46:59 2015 UTC,I have the exact same table which also came with broyhill chairs. No info on it. Do you have a picture of the hinges though? Mine are missing. :-/ mo idea how to keep the flaps up.
Mid_Century,33ywqn,awd3495,2,Mon Apr 27 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"That's our problem, too! Flaps won't stay up, can't figure it out. I'll snap a picture and post it!"

Mid_Century,33vlhh,planc919,7,Sun Apr 26 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"That right there looks to be a very rare and highly collectible ""spear"" chair by IB Kofod Larsen for Selig. Cherish it and treat it well.   https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/seating/lounge-chairs/ib-kofod-larsen-lounge-chair/id-f_1395013/"
Mid_Century,33vlhh,tucshop,3,Sun Apr 26 03:24:20 2015 UTC,I love when people price match things i have to 1stdibs.   Makes for easy sales.
Mid_Century,33vlhh,Misha80,3,Sun Apr 26 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah except OP's is rosewood and probably worth much more than that 1st dibs price which is Beech.  I mean am I wrong or would OP's chair probably go for over $3,000 even in my area of Ohio. I know a shop near hear that has a Kofod-Larsen for Selig in Rosewood that is not nearly as nice looking as this and he said he will not take less than $3,800 and he has it listed at $4,500.  He said in two weeks he has had 3 people serious about it, but none have bought it yet.  So OP cherish that chair, its worth it."
Mid_Century,33vlhh,edgestander,2,Mon Apr 27 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"1st dibs is usually a very high retail price, but I have seen stuff listed below value.   Most of the dealers I've dealt with on there have a trade discount as well, which can be up to 50%.  But when someone looks up something I have in my store in Indiana, and the first thing they see is the same piece at double the price or more, it helps.        I agree with you in this case though, probably $4500 or so, his stuff has been going up lately.  I saw a pair of Elizabeth's double they're estimate and go for $42k plus commision."
Mid_Century,33vlhh,Misha80,2,Mon Apr 27 23:27:26 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I actually love it to the point that I hardly use it.
Mid_Century,33vlhh,F-That,6,Sun Apr 26 11:00:28 2015 UTC,That is amazing.
Mid_Century,33vlhh,F-That,3,Sun Apr 26 02:18:57 2015 UTC,"I just came back to this post because researching the Kofod I picked up yesterday, I came across the Spear chair but you already got yours ID'd.  I have mine apart because it's easier to refinish but I should have it at least stained by this week.   http://i.imgur.com/qLjTjMo.jpg"
Mid_Century,33vlhh,ah18255,2,Sun Apr 26 14:25:20 2015 UTC,I would do unspeakable things to get my hands on that chair. Guard it well my friend.
Mid_Century,33vlhh,horsenbuggy,2,Sun Apr 26 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"Oh no. That's hideous. I'll take it off your hands for $20.  No need to thank me, really."

Mid_Century,33vlhh,Rentboy8,-1,Mon Apr 27 21:43:15 2015 UTC,Can someone point me to a cheaper replica version of chair? I've always loved it!
Mid_Century,33vlhh,Enzymet,3,Sun Apr 26 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly a replica, but you may like Getamas Cigar-series by Wegner. Pretty similar but a lot more common. ...and of course cheaper"
Mid_Century,33vv8h,bidoville,4,Sun Apr 26 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"They're likely Kent Coffey Perspecta.   It looks similar to the Broyhill Brasilia collection, but I'm pretty sure they're Perspecta."
Mid_Century,33vv8h,FreeSammiches,4,Sun Apr 26 11:58:56 2015 UTC,"They also sort of remind me of a broyhill series, but I'm not sure either way."
Mid_Century,33vv8h,awd3495,4,Sun Apr 26 07:27:06 2015 UTC,"Wow. they screamed Broyhill to me too. But looking at Broyhill I can not find that pattern. I suspect it's a company copying the higher quality companies. that said from everything I can see in the photos you would struggle to afford that quality new today.  Those are a great find, at a wonderful price. Really lovely."
Mid_Century,33vv8h,sewnlurk,3,Sun Apr 26 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"That's my thought, too, is that it's a knockoff. I don't think it's perspecta because it's not sculpted. Either Broyhill or Kent Coffey, there's no stamp or marking claiming it, so I'd be surprised to hear it's a bigger name.   Thanks for the nice words, too. I was nearly having buyers remorse."
Mid_Century,33vv8h,sewnlurk,4,Sun Apr 26 15:15:27 2015 UTC,$150 dollars for matching solid wood curio cabinets? You hit the jackpot. I would snatch those up so fast. There may have been a paper label that's long gone. Most of the good quality Danish furniture I have seen didn't have any kind of mark at all.  That looks like good quality furniture to me. You scored big.
Mid_Century,33vv8h,brynalyn,3,Sun Apr 26 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"I can't find any examples of bookcases/curios, but the details remind me of the Kent-Coffey Perspecta line... Now it's driving me crazy too!"

Mid_Century,33lmh6,edgestander,3,Fri Apr 24 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"If its a genuine mersman i think it should have the markings, it may be some backalley knockoff, probably came with some bottleg hootch tho."

On another thread we are having the discussion of weather Peasall was knocked off and by who.  The Mersman has a value around here of $100-$250 in perfect condition. Nobody knocks off a middle market design.  I guess my point is Mersmandoesnt add value, unless you see a unique design aspect of yours, call it Mersman."

Mid_Century,33iwxz,rob7779,3,Wed Apr 22 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"Adrian Pearsall side table with Travertine top. As far as I know he did make tables with this top but your table looks like they either changed design of how the top sits, or it is a knock off. I dont see many knock offs of these table though. It may just be rare.   I have the same style in a coffee table and side table but mine are the glass tops. You can see the difference on how the top rests on the base.   http://i.imgur.com/yXGEwA4.jpg  Sorry its the only pic I have. Here is what they look like up close.   http://imgur.com/DoUGOfS"
Mid_Century,33iwxz,F-That,2,Thu Apr 23 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Nice pic! Yeah, the top of the base is different. The top weighs a ton which was probably a factor."
Mid_Century,33iwxz,edgestander,3,Thu Apr 23 22:13:41 2015 UTC,How about lane?
Mid_Century,33iwxz,a_bruner,2,Fri Apr 24 01:36:43 2015 UTC,I thought you might be on to something with lane but an extensive google image search didn't turn up anything close. Would love to solve the mystery. It's unique.
Mid_Century,33iwxz,edgestander,2,Fri Apr 24 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah here is a Heywood Wakefield that I would say is in the manner of Pearsall, but I can't find anything like this table.  OP should post this on designaddict.com."
Mid_Century,33iwxz,edgestander,3,Fri Apr 24 23:57:42 2015 UTC,Ok.  I think the best were are going to get is in the style of Pearsall I found this and some others similar none exactly like OPs.  The top is made out of Terrazzo that should help some in your search.
Mid_Century,33iwxz,a_bruner,3,Sat Apr 25 00:07:15 2015 UTC,The top isn't terrazzo though. Terrazzo is speckled. The table has swirls.

Mid_Century,33iwxz,F-That,3,Thu Apr 23 14:10:23 2015 UTC,Do you happen to know of any companies that knocked off Pearsall or Craft associates pieces? Just curious. I know Pearsall was inspired by Vladimir Kagen and you can see how he knocked off some of his Kagen pieces in a way.
Mid_Century,33iwxz,edgestander,3,Thu Apr 23 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"You are probably right, it just didn't look like the top sits right on the base right. Every Pearsall side table I have seen only has 4 points that the top rests on.  It might be more ""rare"", I don't like that base as much as the normal design though.  Isn't the floating effect a BIG part of the design aesthetic.  I mean I wonder where he got that floating idea from? Vladimir and this  Edit: I don't want to mislead anyone.  I would LOVE to have this table, Pearsall or not.  I just would prefer the different base."
Mid_Century,33iwxz,F-That,3,Thu Apr 23 22:08:56 2015 UTC,Its cool to see these different tables though so I can index them in my brain for future reference. It would be nice to know if this is a knock off and who in the hell made it.
Mid_Century,33iwxz,BabysInBlack,3,Thu Apr 23 22:56:20 2015 UTC,Totally agree on the floating. This table would sink. HA. Still awesome but wish we knew more about it. Where's antiques roadshow when you need them?
Mid_Century,33iwxz,BabysInBlack,2,Fri Apr 24 00:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't think it is Pearsall, but if it were a knockoff, you would think I could find similar pieces online. I saw cream colored one once, but that's it. They had it labeled as Pearsall, but of course, had no proof."

Mid_Century,33ahgh,cougasaurus,6,Tue Apr 21 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"I don't do ""new MCM"" really.  How about a Florence Knoll knock off?  I see them in your price range all the time.  Simple yet makes a statement and still iconic MCM.  I have no idea of the quality of any new furniture."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,edgestander,2,Tue Apr 21 00:09:19 2015 UTC,Plummers occasionally has stuff that isn't hideous.
Mid_Century,33ahgh,IgnoreAmos,3,Tue Apr 21 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"It's adequate. I have a fabric sofa from there that's about five years old and it's showing some light wear, but I have disobedient pets and had a slightly slovenly lodger/tenant/housemate for a time. I had a tempered glass and brushed stainless side table from there that looked as good as new when the SO had us divest ourselves of it after several years of ownership.  Some of their ""wood"" tables, beds, credenzas, etc. are veneered MDF or plywood and some are solid wood, so you'll need to check on a per-product basis. They had a Noguchi clone table in one of their showrooms that looked and felt like the build quality was good, and at only a fraction of the price of something comparable at DWR."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,IgnoreAmos,3,Tue Apr 21 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I see from your comment history that you're also an A's fan and thus probably from/in the Bay Area. Plummers has a sister company, Scandinavian Designs, with showrooms up there: http://www.scandinaviandesigns.com/location"
Mid_Century,33ahgh,IgnoreAmos,3,Tue Apr 21 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's obviously not legit MC stuff, but some of it's decent and not wildly pricy. Hope it works out for you. Go A's!"
Mid_Century,33ahgh,IgnoreAmos,3,Tue Apr 21 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"Diy a slab daybed, about 450 and you also get an extra place for someone to crash."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,TramStopDan,2,Tue Apr 21 20:50:19 2015 UTC,That's pretty neat.
Mid_Century,33ahgh,SampsonRustic,3,Tue Apr 21 21:01:25 2015 UTC,This is a Danish reproduction
Mid_Century,33ahgh,fritzing,-6,Tue Apr 21 01:45:47 2015 UTC,You could get the real deal for that price if you're patient and not support hack companies that sell shitty versions of dead designers' work.
Mid_Century,33ahgh,serpentineminer,6,Tue Apr 21 20:23:12 2015 UTC,That's nonsense. An authentic teak Wegner three seater is going to run you around 4-5K minimum.
Mid_Century,33ahgh,aeranis,0,Tue Apr 21 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Well, perhaps shoot for something a bit more reasonable? Say, anything by baumritter. There are options other than ""singular iconic design"" and ""shotty chinese knockoff."""
Mid_Century,33ahgh,serpentineminer,6,Tue Apr 21 00:38:37 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude, but I believe you mean ""shoddy""."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,straigh,0,Tue Apr 21 05:54:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, my phone autocorrected ""shitty."" Thanks though"
Mid_Century,33ahgh,serpentineminer,-8,Tue Apr 21 07:43:34 2015 UTC,"Nope. My sister got one at a thrift store for around $100. Not sure it's Wegner, but there's a tag on it that says it's from Denmark. And it's gorgeous."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,horsenbuggy,6,Tue Apr 21 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"The designer is dead...so who does it hurt? I prefer my furniture new, and I like the quality of the stuff I've got from this company."

They still have a few options that would fit the look, like the Karlie Fabric Sofa, and if you hold off until Memorial Day I'll bet they'll have a sale."

Mid_Century,33ahgh,thebestpartofbelieve,2,Tue Apr 21 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"Listen, imma let you finish but the idea of a super comfy sofa doesnt really mesh with the MCM aesthetic.  You're better off getting a deep luxurious leather sofa that looks awful but feels great, than purchasing a mid century daybed/lounger.  There really is no such thing as a big fat comfy MCM sofa."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,cougasaurus,2,Wed Apr 22 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"This post was extremely helpful, as I am also in the market for a new MCM style sofa. I ended up going with this piece from Dot & Bo.  But was also considering this, this, and a few on Joybird."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,hazeldazeI,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:42:24 2015 UTC,and none of those are under $1000 or even that close to under $1000.
Mid_Century,33ahgh,cougasaurus,2,Mon Apr 27 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"The first two links (the two from Dot&Bo, including the one I purchased) are both under $1,000. One is $999 and the other is $899."
Mid_Century,33ahgh,hazeldazeI,2,Sun Apr 26 03:55:50 2015 UTC,"hmmm... for me the 2nd ""this"" was $1498 and on the Joybird page, the lowest item was $1599."

Mid_Century,338z92,sammisaran,6,Mon Apr 20 16:33:11 2015 UTC,they are both just modern remakes of popular danish style chairs...look for an old one
Mid_Century,338z92,rubrduk,5,Mon Apr 20 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was just needing a starting point of what they were called to google/ebay them.   I found other ones, but they were much more expensive than the ikea or urban outfitters options."
Mid_Century,338z92,Toppo,4,Mon Apr 20 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, the EkenÃ¤set chair is actually an old Ikea design from the 50's."
Mid_Century,338z92,srideout,3,Mon Apr 20 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"Just search your local craigslist for Mid Century Lounge in the furniture section. I see these all the time just labeled as Mid Century Lounge chairs. Anything old you get should be heaps better than the Ikea/UO reproduction.   Prices vary depending on condition and just luck. You'll find one.   Also consider when you're buying an older mid century piece, if the time comes to resell you should be able to at least get all your money back. The same definitely can't be said for Ikea/UO."
Mid_Century,338z92,mullacc,3,Mon Apr 20 18:56:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the guidance! I mostly just needed a starting point of what to type in when searching. Helps narrow down when sorting through craigslist.
Mid_Century,338z92,riomx,3,Mon Apr 20 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"A common vintage Danish brand to look for is Selig, which made a handful of models designed by Ib Kofod-Larsen and Poul Jensen.  Nice examples in pairs with new upholstery can be expensive ($2500+). But deals can turn up on craigslist. I bought a nice pair in need of new cushions for $350 a couple years ago. Check out Etsy too. You can probably find a single unlabeled vintage Danish or Yugoslavian chair for $300-500 retail in good condition. Something like this.  Thrive Furniture and Joybird Furniture sell modern reproductions. France & Son sells a knock-off of a Hans Wegner design. But for $500+, I think it's probably better to go vintage."
Mid_Century,338z92,riomx,2,Mon Apr 20 22:26:44 2015 UTC,Didn't they just launch that line again? Why is it discontinued?
Mid_Century,338z92,Toppo,2,Tue Apr 21 00:23:20 2015 UTC,It was introduced as a special edition of sorts with a limited run.
Mid_Century,338z92,riomx,3,Tue Apr 21 01:29:54 2015 UTC,"That's disappointing. Furniture manufacturers need to take note -- people want long-lasting styles that will last multiple generations, not what's popular and trendy for the short-term."
Mid_Century,338z92,Toppo,2,Tue Apr 21 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"Well, when talking about Ikea, ""lasting multiple generations"" isn't really their thing. Ikea is cheap for a reason."
Mid_Century,338z92,riomx,3,Tue Apr 21 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"There's a common misconception that all of their furniture is garbage. It isn't -- there are varying price points and tiers of quality in their product line. Plenty of their furniture is well-made and long-lasting, especially at the higher end of their prices."
Mid_Century,338z92,Toppo,3,Tue Apr 21 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really think their furniture is garbage. Mostly affordable and yea, it means the more cheaper ones aren't that lasting, and people do generally know this. But when you are moving on your first flat or something and need just some basic affordable good looking stuff, Ikea is good for that.  Interestingly, Ikea is one of the few original Scandinavian companies that actually widely upholds the principles of Scandinavian design: that beautiful design should be affordable and available to everyone, kind of making ""democratic design"" for everyone to enjoy. But for example if you want even a official reproduction of an Alvar Aalto table or of an Aarnio ball chair the prices are very high, even though originally they originally were relatively affordable products. Ikea is one of the few Scandinavian designers that still actually makes reasonably aesthetic stuff almost everyone can afford."
Mid_Century,338z92,riomx,2,Wed Apr 22 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"That's why I have respect for them. I can't say I'm thrilled about all of their designs (especially their seeming obsession with sterile blonde wood), but I love that they make good design affordable for the masses.  It's frustrating to know that Charles and Ray Eames had a similar intention with their designs and now they have effectively been priced out of reach for most people."
Mid_Century,338z92,Toppo,2,Wed Apr 22 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yea I respect Ikea in that sense too. And they also really do try to cater to variety of tastes, like traditional, minimalist, extravagant, modern and so on.  I think with sterile blonde wood you mean this? I think the reason for those is that birch is very durable, grows easily in Scandinavia and because of its light color it has become quite popular material in modern Scandinavian interior design(which I happen to dislike for it's very sterility and whiteness and for seeing too much of apartments like that)."
Mid_Century,3359n3,dubbelb,4,Sun Apr 19 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. Tomado shelves I think, or a knockoff thereof. Dutch."
Mid_Century,3359n3,macrossmaster,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:59:18 2015 UTC,Hm I'm pretty certain that it is not tomado. Tomado looks more like the Swedish string shelving system.   This just has the rails closely to the wall and the legs going out to support each shelf  Edit: seems like it is some type of cado shelving system knock off (or a cheaper model)
Mid_Century,3359n3,macrossmaster,3,Mon Apr 20 05:18:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, just looked closer - thought they were pressed metal. Paul Cadovius then? Sorry I'm not more help."
Mid_Century,3359n3,fat_al142,2,Mon Apr 20 10:34:27 2015 UTC,Seems very similar to cadovious! Thanks!  Wonder if he made units with metal frame (the thing attached to the wall) instead of wood. I've got some googling to do!
Mid_Century,3359n3,bidoville,5,Mon Apr 20 10:38:13 2015 UTC,"Love it. Where'd you find it, anon?"
Mid_Century,3359n3,KobayashiMeru,2,Mon Apr 20 12:00:08 2015 UTC,I found it on a local variant of the american craigslist. But it was about 95 usd (and I was unsure if it was a real Cadovious) and I bought a string-system shelf in teak just the other day.
Mid_Century,3359n3,jfk_sfa,2,Tue Apr 21 20:39:10 2015 UTC,"Not on topic, but your floors are gorgeous."

Mid_Century,33208g,maxreggie,2,Sat Apr 18 21:46:57 2015 UTC,Nice! That couch and rug are also lovely.
Mid_Century,32zej4,maxreggie,8,Sat Apr 18 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"That's very cool, but I'm fairly certain that poop/olive was the original finish. Wood underneath looks quite nice though, the end project will probably be better than the original."
Mid_Century,32zej4,torknorggren,8,Sat Apr 18 04:09:16 2015 UTC,Yup. Some original finishes are not worth preserving. I'd say this falls into that category.
Mid_Century,32zej4,chzplz,6,Sat Apr 18 10:25:06 2015 UTC,Danish oil would look amazing
Mid_Century,32zej4,riomx,4,Sun Apr 19 03:30:49 2015 UTC,Definitely interested! Nice work so far and keep us posted!
Mid_Century,32yc2v,spingus,23,Fri Apr 17 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be the lone voice of dissent, but, it really looks more mid-70s, far past the heyday of MCM. Not the clean lines of modernity, but rather the return of strange rococo excesses. Good on you if that's your bag, but imo it doesn't really fit here."
Mid_Century,32yc2v,torknorggren,8,Sat Apr 18 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right (early 70s would be my guess), but it still fucking RULES."

Mid_Century,32yc2v,CheesyGoodness,2,Sat Apr 18 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"no worries! the house simply was built in 1955--but it is not modernist or 'architectural'.  It has a few things in it like this lamp that are..not new.  I know very little about design history and philosophy so I have a hard time placing items like this light.  If this were 30 years ago my younger self would have despised it, but now I like it as an unusual piece that I intend to incorporate in my decor.  Thankyou for pointing out that it is not MCM but later, that will help me as I go about decorating my new house :)"

Mid_Century,32yryc,CartoonDogOnJetpack,6,Fri Apr 17 20:58:35 2015 UTC,I've seen it on the classifieds too. It's a great price authentic or not. All it would need is some veneer repairs and teak oil.
Mid_Century,32yryc,yourmommo,6,Fri Apr 17 22:40:22 2015 UTC,You say veneer repairs like its easy

Mid_Century,32yryc,DFWPhotoguy,3,Sat Apr 18 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"In any case, I love the design of those drawer pulls. As has been pointed out, dealing with the messed up veneer won't be easy, but the damage looks pretty minor and a go-round with restore-a-finish might make it really shine."
Mid_Century,32qk5g,Y-Cha,4,Wed Apr 15 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"If you google Danish Modern Dining Chair, just about everything you see would go and look great.  My personal preference would be for (provided you can find them and afford them) some Hans Wegner Sawbuck chairs."
Mid_Century,32qk5g,likewhatadoormightbe,2,Thu Apr 16 09:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty fair to say (just about everything/anything might suit).  The Sawbucks look nice - I'd prefer them over the Nakashima Conoid that /u/Emerone noted, too."

Mid_Century,32qk5g,Woolio,3,Thu Apr 16 23:57:06 2015 UTC,Depends. What look are you going for? I think you could do anything from a wilder Thonet to an Eames DCW.
Mid_Century,32qk5g,Woolio,2,Thu Apr 16 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty flexible in terms of look. Really trying to get some ideas and opinions out of this thread.  I'll be moving soon, so we'll probably use our beat old inherited Stakmores until we decide on something nicer for our (first) new place - to me, it kind of hinges on that - finding out what space we've got and what we might be able to do with it.   Great table, as it's so configurable - it saw a lot of use in my family as a child, and I hope to continue such.

I prefer to find most of my MC decor in the wild (thrifts, garage sales, etc.) but I've never been fortunate enough to stumble upon a clock. Whats worse is that my lady is a big fan of Grimm and whoever does the set design is just as big of a fan of these clocks as me.  The show is absolutely filled with wonder MC decor, including dozens of clocks.  Every episode taunts me.  Well, no more!  Anyway, its not in the greatest shape, it needs to be cleaned and there are a couple of spots that need to be buffed out.  But it was dirt cheap, it works and I love it!  Happy hunting, friends."

As much as I adore that Girard fabric, the foam is completely shot - it's lumpy and brittle and the fabric has separated from it. :( I haven't decided yet if I'm going to sell it, strip it, or just repurpose it as a decorative chair.  I recently bought this shell to replace it. I'm going to have the fabric and foam stripped (both are in terrible condition) with help from a Herman Miller employee. I'm pretty excited."

But when I see perfectly decorated cabinets like that I wonder if the items have any meaning or if they were just chosen because they look right. When I look at the less perfect items on my shelves, each one has meaning - a glass bottle collection I inherited from my grandmother, Russian nesting dolls I bought in Moscow, a figurine of a Chinese lady I bought in Beijing, a lantern I bought at Fort Point, a clock my friend gave me... all deeply personal but not what a decorator would select."

Mid_Century,32mimu,edgestander,5,Tue Apr 14 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Since I see these mentioned on this Sub a lot, I needed to chime in.   I bought a knockoff.  It was cheap, poorly made, bad materials, uncomfortable, and smelled.  When they call these chair a replica, that is what it is.  I wouldn't even consider it furniture.   When I was able to find a real vintage Eames at a price I could handle, I put that piece of crap on the side of the road for some random to just pick up.   Anyone that is truly into this Chair and really wants one, should do themselves a favor, and never consider buying one of these chinese pieces of garbage.  I am saying this from experience.  I am sure there are varying qualities of these knockoff Eames out there, but doubt any of them are worth buying."
Mid_Century,32mimu,golgiiguy,2,Tue Apr 21 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the importers are turning a profit by posting on ebay/amazon. But be aware, these often arrive damaged. An importer will have the ability to negotiate with the Chinese supplier because they order in quantity. You probably won't be able to, so it's a risk. Also, I've seen these chairs first hand and I think they're trash, but that's a personal opinion. Otherwise I would have ordered one myself."
Mid_Century,32mimu,fast4ward,2,Wed Apr 15 12:22:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they are not going to be good quality. If I were you I'd buy something else for the same money. That much could buy you a beautiful chair."
Mid_Century,32mimu,obamapastry,3,Wed Apr 15 18:55:01 2015 UTC,I understand the quality issues.  I have a vintage Plycraft so no need for me. My next one will be the real deal.  It just seems that these Ebay sellers are making a couple hundred $ off of basically placing an order for a person on alibaba.
Mid_Century,32mimu,obamapastry,2,Thu Apr 16 00:49:48 2015 UTC,That's good to hear OP. Would love to see a picture post of your Plycraft! :)
Mid_Century,32mimu,golgiiguy,3,Fri Apr 17 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"A Vintage Plycraft, or other vintage knockoffs are a different story from buying these new knockoffs.  I imagine a Plycraft is a great chair and has its own look and history in itself."

Mid_Century,32htxs,mgriffioen,9,Mon Apr 13 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but the arms look very large and disproportional. Other than that, it's hard to tell by pictures. Usually, however, the veneer, leather, and foam is not the top-notch quality that Herman Miller uses when examining replicas. In some instances the 'veneer' may even be plastic. Props on the authentic Eames table, though!"
Mid_Century,32htxs,yourmommo,4,Mon Apr 13 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"Ok other than the likely quality issues (bad particle board, poor quality foam and leather) I see the following. Ottoman way to big!  Tufting not deep enough. Armrests way to large!  Headrest way too wide. Hard to tell if it's the angle or the height of the ottoman but something is off when I compare the hight of the front of the chair with the height of the ottoman. Also there doesn't appear to be enough space between the lumbar support and the seat."
Mid_Century,32htxs,edgestander,4,Tue Apr 14 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"It looks great, and here's the thing: you're not some Swiss magnate furniture investor. You want this furniture for the same reasons that Charles and Ray designed it: to live in it. You don't want some delicate museum piece that you can't sit in, and you don't want to end up like my friends who are about to spend $10k to get their authentic lounger rebuilt because sixty year old screws can only hold together for so long."
Mid_Century,32htxs,callmesnake13,3,Tue Apr 14 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I think it looks great and it feels really well built. I know that it's not going to have the same ""feeling"" as an original, but to me, it still looks pretty damn close and is VERY comfortable. I don't sit on any other furniture in that room."
Mid_Century,32htxs,callmesnake13,2,Tue Apr 14 23:08:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that's how I feel about my $400 aluminum group knockoff. The fake leather is starting to rip off but I still love it and it looks good.
Mid_Century,32htxs,borkborkbork99,2,Tue Apr 14 23:15:03 2015 UTC,May I ask where you bought it from?
Mid_Century,32htxs,golgiiguy,3,Tue Apr 14 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, eBay. I got it for $700 shipped."
Mid_Century,32htxs,edgestander,2,Tue Apr 14 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"This repo looks alright, but there is nothing like the real thing.  Fact is, you know it is repo, and always will.  I have gone the repo route, and I was very unhappy with it.  I would not recommend buying a new repo at any cost for any chair other than a vintage plycraft or Selig or something.  If you need to go the repo route due to cost, I would at least go vintage.  At least you dont end up with something that is just Chinese built garbage.  I recommend anyone that is thinking about buying a repo of this chair, actually sit in real one to know the difference themselves."
Mid_Century,32htxs,obamapastry,2,Tue Apr 14 23:05:08 2015 UTC,I was going to say this in response to u/calmesnake13's post.  I got my vintage eames knock of lounger for $200 local pick up.
Mid_Century,32htxs,MCMif-ied,2,Tue Apr 14 23:46:10 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I sat in a real lounger for the first time about a month ago and realised that there really is a reason for the cult following. I highly doubt any repro could feel that comfy.
Mid_Century,32htxs,AshleyBanksHitSingle,2,Sun Apr 19 23:17:56 2015 UTC,It looks decent. I think the leather quality gives it away but for $700 you can't go wrong. Does anyone know of any reputable sites to get a good replica from?
Mid_Century,32htxs,MCMif-ied,2,Thu Apr 16 16:05:01 2015 UTC,Rove furniture in BC makes the best replica. They use all the original plans and materials. The chairs are gorgeous and I've seen/sat in the real deals and those particular knock-offs and have observed virtually no differences.
Mid_Century,32htxs,fast4ward,2,Thu Apr 16 21:33:38 2015 UTC,I heard Manhattan Home Design has a good one. I've really got to do some more research though before I make my mind up!
Mid_Century,32e8m2,JJTheJetPlane5657,9,Mon Apr 13 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking for an Eames Soft Pad Group Executive Chair. There are several knockoff versions available, but I think Herman Miller / Eames would be the original manufacturer."

Mid_Century,32e8m2,xxxletdownxxx,6,Mon Apr 13 02:16:15 2015 UTC,Get a real one. They go for under $1000 on eBay and will be worth at least as much for the next 20 years - which it will easily last for. Knock off will be in a landfill in 4 years at best
Mid_Century,32e8m2,Uncle_Erik,8,Mon Apr 13 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"$1,000 is a stiff price for a chair.  I'd recommend hitting up local junk and antique stores.  Also check office surplus stores.  Most old chairs can be reupholstered and repainted to look like new.  My desk chair is a 1950s Steelcase.  I got it for $15 at a thrift store.  It's in relatively good shape, but I will eventually repaint it to match my mint green tanker desk and drop some green leather on it."
Mid_Century,32e8m2,Woolio,6,Mon Apr 13 07:00:02 2015 UTC,"If you've got a big local university, you might be able to find them at surplus sales and stuff. I've seen them go for a few hundred bucks."

Mid_Century,32e8m2,themorningmoon,3,Mon Apr 13 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"I felt like I was getting away with something. I think it was one of those situations where the seller sees a couple blemishes and thinks that that brings the value way down...when it's really just completely normal vintage wear. It's a great chair. I originally wanted the non-soft pad chair, but for that price, I couldn't pass it up!"

Maybe saving a thousand, but you still have to spend $1200 to get the knockoff. If you like the era but are willing to compromise on the exact design, you could search for a ""Tanker Chair"" or Steelcase brand desk chairs. You can find those from the same era at much, much more affordable prices. Not as fancy as the Eames designs but it'll help you get a mid-century modern style office together more easily."

Mid_Century,32czw1,Richienyc718,5,Sun Apr 12 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"Do A LOT of Googling and find others who have done similar tables. Learn from their experience.  Many Lanes had extremely thin veneer on the top. Be very, very careful when sanding that top as even the most careful hand may push right through the veneer. I'd strip the top with a liquid stripper and then use either a super fine grade or steel wool to sand it further.

They do house clearance and (I hate to say this as it sounds cruel) a lot of the late elderly people whose houses are being cleared out are of the age that they bought midcentury pieces.

Just like today.  This chair was probably sold somewhere similar to The Room Store or Target and it's cute, but nothing valuable really.  It's called a slipper chair and it's actually really cute.  The value is only in how much you like it and how good it looks in your home.  As a furniture flipper, I'd buy this for less than $30, reupholster it, and sell it for under $350."

Mid_Century,31xjn0,unsurebutwilling,2,Thu Apr 9 04:15:41 2015 UTC,I cant help but think that this would make an awesome side table. With some TLC and soft pads to replace the wheels I would love this piece.
Mid_Century,31tc80,shoptillyoudrop,3,Wed Apr 8 00:22:49 2015 UTC,I love the Eames executive chair! Does anyone know of any other iconic designs that were on the show?  I'm shocked that the Eames Lounge chair hasn't made an appearance.
Mid_Century,31tc80,alohachrissy,2,Thu Apr 9 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I definitely remember seeing the Arden Sofa in a number of episodes, and I know that Sterling's office is filled with Eero Saarinen pieces... I do agree, though. It's odd that the Eames Lounge Chair has never made an appearance, at least not that I remember.  That being said, I am definitely saving for one ;)"

I yanked all the electronics and speakers, and stuffed in the guts of a mid 90s Sony bookshelf system.  Replaced the (missing) turntable with one of my old Technics SL-1200 MK2 decks.

And if you look closely at the armrests, they are partially covered with another fabric that she didn't seem to like very much and that helped stop the scratching.

Mid_Century,31o2l3,justinpugh,3,Mon Apr 6 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"Was it authentic, or a replica?  I sat in this one recently, and I was blown away by the comfort/quality it provided, but I'm still kind of interested in experiencing the ""real thing"" for myself. Just curious if others had a better opinion about it."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,dorky2,2,Fri Apr 10 20:21:13 2015 UTC,Authentic.  It is my uncle's.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,TheFanslator,5,Fri Apr 10 20:28:34 2015 UTC,That Hans Wegner is gorgeous. That perfect amount of retro and space age.  That Sergio Rodriguez chair looks like it might not let go of you if you sit on it.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,obamapastry,3,Mon Apr 6 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"Wait, the Mole chair looks an awful lot like the one someone posted about on here a month ago. Someone IDed it as a Percival Lafer but with strange legs."

Mid_Century,31o2l3,JimmyRUDEjam,3,Tue Apr 7 14:09:17 2015 UTC,The only one I really like is the papa bear chair and much like the eames it's out of my price range. Style is expensive.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,yourmommo,2,Tue Apr 7 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think the LC3 is actually a 'collection' with the sofas and chairs with larger, more comfortable frames and cushions (plus the option for down cushions), while the LC2 collection is the more famous squared-off design that is not the most comfortable."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,fspecnik,2,Tue Apr 7 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like Barcelona's are just barely more comfortable than LC2's as well. They look like chairs that aren't ever sat in. Any high fashion/class design with them or four of them arranged around a coffee table are only for the richest or most extravagant bank lobbies/reception areas. They look great but I feel like they are show pieces, not really meant to be lounged in."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,yourmommo,2,Tue Apr 7 21:14:20 2015 UTC,I agree. Plus just the chair is more expensive than your basic Eames Lounge with the Ottoman.

Mid_Century,31o2l3,Newtothisredditbiz,2,Mon Apr 13 22:44:20 2015 UTC,There's always the LC4 if you want comfy.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,golgiiguy,4,Mon Apr 6 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Eames Lounge chair is an iconic design.   It's never my intention to condescend, but  you should consider every piece of furniture in your home a personal expression.   To me the Eames Lounge chair says, I read a load of interior design mags/blogs and I want to replicate other peoples style.   There's a whole world of design out there, it's lame that tonnes of people jock this one chair ad nauseam."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,yourmommo,3,Tue Apr 7 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Eames speaks to me somehow as the ultimate.  There is nothing like it I can say comes close to what I consider perfect.  I see the perception that some people are going for the ""status"" of Eames, but the design and comfort is really what does it for me.  Not copying someone else's taste, it is my personal expression.  So what if a lot of people feel the same way?  like a bunch of people that like a particular band or genre of music.  Does that make them all mindless followers?"
Mid_Century,31o2l3,mullacc,2,Mon Apr 6 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I feel like every other good design should be appreciated also, but I feel that the Eames Lounge Chair is the most famous for a reason. That being said, I don't own an Eames Lounge but I do have a LC3 Grand Confort, because it fits in better where it is."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,juicyspace,2,Tue Apr 7 21:17:59 2015 UTC,Hans Wegner shows you how to sit in his chair.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,mikeyb89,2,Tue Apr 7 21:09:08 2015 UTC,This is much better than the black/(leather?). Gives it that organic edge that the black one is missing.
Mid_Century,31o2l3,Section37,2,Mon Apr 6 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly fond of any of these over the eames. However, I think the scoop chair is beautiful. Wehave the LC3s in our lobby at work, so uncomfortable."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,MCMif-ied,2,Tue Apr 7 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"One thing I learned when shopping for a good lounge chair is to google image search it, and see if there are any pictures of people looking comfortable in it. If you can't find any, it's not worth going to see it in person, you already know it won't be comfortable.  Here's the ELC: https://eamesstore.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eames-demitrios-enjoying-iconic-eames-lounge-chair.jpg  Here's the Papa Bear: http://blog.modernica.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Sarah-Shahi-via-Esquire1.jpg  Want to bet which is more comfortable?"

Mid_Century,31o2l3,F-That,4,Wed Apr 8 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree that the Wegner is possibly one of the most perfect looking chairs ever. If not for the footstool/ottoman (which is fine) ... it would be heaven on Earth. The stool is just... too plain. It's design just isn't quite cohesive with the chair.  The others are obviously classics we've all learned about in school (well, if you're a designer). But they all have their problems. Too wide, no arms, over comfort (you can never get out of it!), and feigning organic (Wegner's Ox Chair, which I don't recall seeing before - an am making this deduction on sight alone)."
Mid_Century,31o2l3,riomx,2,Thu Apr 9 20:05:37 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of the Papa Bear chair myself. Plus the price on the original is just ridiculous.
Mid_Century,31o59z,loudtyper,3,Mon Apr 6 20:50:47 2015 UTC,It's just a piece of plywood that has been steamed to bend. Hit up a local wood shop and ask them what'd be the cost for them to make a new piece for you.

Mid_Century,31jazm,TheJonnyDanger,3,Sun Apr 5 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for letting me know. I'll message you if my dealer/friend isn't interested. How similar are the letters you bought to the ones I have? I've never handled facade letters before, and would like to learn how much of a difference there is (in value, stylistic significance, desirability, etc.) between my letters and the many similar (but not identical) ones on ebay right now.  Does the font, for example, make much of a difference to collectors? How about the fact that mine are solid whereas many of the facade letters I see online are hollow? Anyway, I'm glad you got in touch, and you may here from me in a few days."
Mid_Century,31jazm,jukranpuju,4,Sun Apr 5 20:22:14 2015 UTC,"To tell you the truth, most of these types of letters don't seem to have an incredible amount of collectible value because they are pretty ubiquitous, what with a lot of them showing up in salvage lots often, plus I think there are some Chinese factories pumping out some new stock, fueled by some Pinterest fad. I personally look for cool fonts and/or ones that are kind of, well, fucked up a little because I'm a sucker for salvage."
Mid_Century,31jazm,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 6 07:13:44 2015 UTC,"This information is so helpful! It explains why my Google image searches turn up almost exclusively Pinterest hits. And I noticed that a lot of the ""vintage"" letter sets on ebay look suspiciously new, so your mention of a new generation of reproductions flooding the market makes a lot of sense and also lets me know to inspect facade letters carefully in the future.   I met with the antique dealer yesterday and he bought all 35 of the cast aluminum letters for $200, an amount that I'm happy with. Having some knowledge of these letters gave me much more confident when negotiating. The helpfulness, sense of community, and friendly tone of this subreddit can encapsulate my favorite qualities of reddit in general, and I thank you for helping make it that way."
Mid_Century,31jazm,frodnorg,4,Tue Apr 7 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"Name of the font used in those aluminum letters is ""Futura""."
Mid_Century,31jazm,awd3495,4,Mon Apr 6 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"Futura (typeface):       Futura is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed in 1927  by Paul Renner. It was designed as a contribution on the New Frankfurt-project. It is based on geometric shapes that became representative of visual elements of the Bauhaus design style of 1919â33.  Commissioned by the Bauer Type Foundry, in reaction to Ludwig & Mayer's seminal Erbar of 1922, Futura was commercially released in 1936.   Futura has an appearance of efficiency and forwardness. Although Renner was not associated with the Bauhaus, he shared many of its idioms and believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach of previous sans-serif designs (now often called grotesques), which were based on the models of signpainting, traditional serif typefaces and condensed lettering, in favour of simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of near-even weight, which are low in contrast. The lowercase has tall ascenders, which rise above the cap line. The uppercase characters present proportions similar to those of classical Roman capitals.

This is the case at %75 of garage sales. Its a great place if you have money to give resellers
Mid_Century,31fmiq,FreeSammiches,2,Sun Apr 5 03:15:33 2015 UTC,I didn't say to get stuff at a reasonable price.  We tend to do all our buying in San Antonio. It just takes a lot more time to find good stuff.
Mid_Century,31dxsk,guarthots,4,Sat Apr 4 03:46:00 2015 UTC,Nice. Watching The Flash? :)
Mid_Century,31dxsk,MarsNeedsGuitars,2,Sat Apr 4 08:57:31 2015 UTC,Yep. I posted this update while waiting for my wife to finish her chapter so we could start.
Mid_Century,31dxsk,Woolio,2,Sat Apr 4 17:07:34 2015 UTC,We haven't been able to find out much about it or the Garrison furniture company. About all we've determined is that they did indeed sell a credenza like this alongside the hutch that we started with.
Mid_Century,31dxsk,F-That,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"Last weekend's auction hutch has been decapitated and now serves as our new entertainment center.  http://i.imgur.com/tYVb6O8.jpg  It currently houses a Mac mini, a Wii, and a PS3. It will also house a Blu-ray player once we buy a smaller one."
Mid_Century,31dxsk,Woolio,2,Sat Apr 4 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"What did you end up doing with the hutch bit? You could probably sell that on its own, or wall-mount it somewhere else. Never hurts to have a good curio cabinet around.   Looking back on it, if you found a nice low, wide bookshelf, and stuck that on top, it'd make a great office piece. You could probably build one out of plywood pretty cheaply, if you wanted."
Mid_Century,31356x,TramStopDan,3,Wed Apr 1 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"I saw one of these recently at a junk shop/hoarder's warehouse a few towns over... Thing has been sitting outside in the rain, on its end, for God knows how long. The veneer had started peeling, and the hinges had seized. He had it priced at over $100.   It was far from the worst thing I saw there... It was where dreams go to die.   I told the guy running it what an idiot he was and left.   Yours is fantastic, though. It's a brilliant piece."

Mid_Century,31356x,psrivats,3,Wed Apr 1 18:14:33 2015 UTC,I haven't even touched it yet. About to get inside to clean and lube all the connections and see if I can sort out why the turntable doesn't work. I may just pull it and provide connections so whomever buys it can add a nicer one.
Mid_Century,31356x,F-That,2,Wed Apr 1 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"I have a Zenith but not that model. I have the X940. Everything works but I have to work out a issue with the balance from the speakers. One likes to work great and the other speaker is having issues. Not sure if I want to keep original, or replace the speakers and tuner for something newer."
Mid_Century,31356x,F-That,3,Wed Apr 1 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"The bass knob doesn't seem to be working, I'll need to get in there with some deoxit and see if I can fix it."
Mid_Century,31356x,F-That,2,Wed Apr 1 20:08:15 2015 UTC,I would love to keep mine original but I would rather have something working and sounding good for me to enjoy now. I'm kind of on the fence with it.
Mid_Century,31356x,F-That,3,Wed Apr 1 20:42:05 2015 UTC,What all is wrong with yours?
Mid_Century,31356x,punoff,2,Wed Apr 1 20:53:57 2015 UTC,Well the speakers are kind of hollow sounding. Not sure if I replaced the resistors in the amp if that would fix that issue or not. Also the tuner knobs are just not up to par. I'm not good with electrical and I know these older pieces are quite expensive if you take them in for repair. I just figured either bypassing the original parts with some bolt on amp and new speakers would be a good fix. The turntable works awesome though. I just wish the speakers sounded more clear.
Mid_Century,31356x,oceanfr0g,3,Wed Apr 1 20:58:43 2015 UTC,I've put a few of these into various projects. No phono input but otherwise pretty handy and not too expensive. A little weak overall but they're served me well.

Mid_Century,30yjj4,JeffreyArrrHolland,3,Tue Mar 31 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"ha! funny what you find what you check your web stats... thanks for the promo. if you care, a few things:  â¢ true: you could definitely DIY it with the correct tools, in fact, that's how i got started â i was looking for a narrow storage unit for my son's room and couldn't find one... You'll need a tablesaw, metal chopsaw, sander, bead-blaster, drill press, HVLP sprayer and router (or dedicated skillsaw with 1/8 wide dado blade), but if you were looking for a less-precise or more rugged finish you might get by with less. unfortunately, HD doesn't sell 15-ply plywood (apple-ply), so you'll have to head to a more specialty lumber yard. i'd suggest avoiding HD's ""Sandee"" plywood as it bows like crazy over time. their other stock is not much better and only has 7-9 plys. given the time it'll take you to make them, start with good materials. your time is worth more than that  â¢ not because I don't like them (I've spent plenty of money there for my renovation: www.redneckmodern.com ...), none of the materials are from HD... i tried, but the stuff just isn't high enough quality. i have to head to a few specialty shops in the bay area. macbeath hardwood is fantastic.  â¢ the legs are anodized aluminum (i buy them online). they come in longer sections, i cut them (quite square) and bead blast the ends to match the matte anodized finish.  â¢ ""the difference in quality is quite apparent however"" ... i'm a bit confused by this as the Eames units also have exposed edges and join the exact same way (screw into the side). In fact, if you take a look at the Eames units, the fit and finish of mine are actually better: the leg fits more securely in the slot, the panels have a cleaner attachment and the finish is much smoother (i was honestly a bit surprised at the HM finish...a  bit disappointing. i've some photos from a local DWR of the HM/eames unit and i was going to do a side-by-side post, but i thought it in bad taste. the eames design is fantastic. i just wish the ethos that began with them them followed today â alleames pieces are too expensive for what they are, even considering the design-markup. fwiw: lately, i've been making the panels ""full height"" so some of the weight is distributed on the panels themselves. this is easy for the ones i make locally, but if someone is assembling them at home, it's harder to be that precise for a DIY assembly (so i make them with a bit of space and play). i've customers with full shelves of art books and they're holding steady.  â¢ ""you can see it is not even square but still a 90 degree post""... not sure what you mean here. the pieces are quite square (way more so than the HM pieces). it might be the photo. i tweak them in PS quite a bit. i also let the tops extend about 1-ply past the post to alleviate scratching or snagging on the legs.  â¢ ""He doesn't use those cross wires""... honestly, i wish i had access to them. it's the one piece i've not been able to replicate.  tip: you /will/ have trouble finding quality materials at HD or Lowe's. my material cost is well over 50% of the cost of the units (both the plywood sheet and walnut panel i use for the shelves are $125 for a 4X8)... check your local yellow pages for good lumber shops in your area.  feel free to hit me up with DIY questions... i don't mind answering them at all. if you're making them, i know you're not going to buy mine, so no skin off my teeth there. if i can help you from making a mistake or two, i'd be more than happy to assist. i probably won't look back on this thread, so a direct email would be best.

Mid_Century,30yjj4,norcalmod,6,Sun Apr 5 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"the difference in quality is quite apparent however; raw plywood edges, exposed wood screws, no actual joinery.  screwing laterally between laminations like that is not strong either, particularly on the corners where they are placed so close to the edge.      edit:  you could also make any of these for under $100 in an afternoon with a trip a home depot and simple tools."

EDIT: Just looked at the norcalmod ones again and I think that is exactly what they are doing. Just using angle aluminum. If you look at the middle posts on the larger sections, you can see it is not even square but still a 90 degree post. That is not as clean looking for a finished piece, but i'm sure that is because he is getting these parts from local hardware stores and making due."

You might see if there's a shabby chic sub-Reddit or message board with more information, but I think it's probably from the 1930's-1940's and it's called an etched and beveled mirror or sometimes a Venetian mirror."

Their arguments don't even make sense, either; the pools in Palm Springs are not causing the California water shortage, the local farming industry is.   It's just bizarre."
Mid_Century,30t6ef,ohfukitschuck,13,Mon Mar 30 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your best bet in this situation is to avoid sanders. That thing's probably veneered, not solid, so you'd sand right through the top layer and leave it looking worse than it does now.   It looks like walnut veneer, most things from this period have either a lacquer or a polyurethane finish. Try some chemical strippers, like soygel, to knock most of it off, and finish with a light, high-grit hand sanding. You should be able to preserve most of the stain, but you can always throw another coat of color-matched or darker on it once you've got the sealant off.   When you're looking at resealing it, try an oil finish instead of a polyurethane or other polyresin-based product. Someone here refinished a Lane table in Danish Oil, I'd go look at what they did and copy it almost exactly. You'll reduce the overall damage to the veneer and have a much better finish than you would if you took an electric sander to it.   As for what it is, it looks like office contract furniture. It'll make a fine TV stand, I'm sure."

Mid_Century,30t6ef,TheTallGuy0,3,Mon Mar 30 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Sanding isn't always the solution, but when you do have to, using an orbital sander with a random pattern is just fine.

Mid_Century,30mw63,guarthots,3,Sat Mar 28 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"This piece confuses me. The bottom definitely looks mid century, while the top just... Looks like anything you would find today at a furniture depo. I definitely like your plan, because I really like the bottom part!"
Mid_Century,30lzxe,ButabusRT,7,Sat Mar 28 16:31:03 2015 UTC,It looks like vinyl to me.
Mid_Century,30lzxe,witchsbrew,2,Sat Mar 28 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"You can pop one of the top cushions off and just look at the loose ""leather"" stapled on the back. It should slide right up from the clips, no screws to remove. Leather or not, it looks great!  I'm restoring a similar one now, replacing the naugahyde with real leather. Enjoy!"
Mid_Century,30lzxe,fast4ward,3,Sat Mar 28 18:28:35 2015 UTC,The cushions for these chairs are attached with screws. They're hidden with wood button plugs.
Mid_Century,30lzxe,riomx,2,Sun Mar 29 01:16:32 2015 UTC,This is probably one of the best vintage knockoffs I have seen.
Mid_Century,30lzxe,golgiiguy,2,Mon Apr 6 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"That looks so comfortable! You're so lucky to have a cool piece of design history, leather or not!"
Mid_Century,30lzxe,alohachrissy,2,Wed Apr 8 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the sideways picture. Can anyone tell if this leather or naugahyde/vinyl? It's an old Eames knockoff that I just bought, might be Plydesigns. Rosewood shell. There's some wear on the left side of the seat that might give some clues."
Mid_Century,30lzxe,riomx,4,Mon Apr 6 13:39:15 2015 UTC,4-star base with welting only on the top of the armrest = most likely Plydesigns.  I haven't seen one yet that used leather. They always seemed to use vinyl.
Mid_Century,30lzxe,riomx,3,Sat Mar 28 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think so, here's another picture of it:  http://imgur.com/BGsz07W"
Mid_Century,30lzxe,riomx,3,Sat Mar 28 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, sure is. The base looks to be in great shape!"
Mid_Century,30lzxe,yourmommo,2,Sat Mar 28 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"Looking at your pic, I swear I've seen a similar setting for another chair sold on eBay."
Mid_Century,30lzxe,MarsupialRed,2,Sat Mar 28 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing! I remember an Eames aluminum group chair missing its fabric, and a set of some danish chairs."

Mid_Century,30id0k,AdamUllstrom,2,Fri Mar 27 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Gunnar Ander is my personal favorite. I found a pair of candle sticks at a thrift shop but not the wooden animals yet.
Mid_Century,30id0k,MercuryChild,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:32:49 2015 UTC,These are the things that keep me going back to thrift stores. You find something like this and it fuels the fire to keep going back. I have came up 2 bullet planters in the same week after years of searching for them in the wild. Very cool find. I hope to come up on these gems someday myself.
Mid_Century,30id0k,MercuryChild,6,Fri Mar 27 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"Wow! Great finds!   My friends and family keep inquiring about how I find so much good stuff. It's 80% persistence, 20% knowing what to look for. I go to multiple stores almost every day. The vast majority of visits, I find nothing. Those visits I do walk away with something, it's only rarely a really great find. Gotta stick by it."

Mid_Century,30imdi,octopusonmyabdomen,0,Sat Mar 28 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"We absolutely love mid-century modern furniture. We think the 50's and 60's were the golden age of furniture design. An era in decor design that has yet to be matched for it's output of classic furniture designs that has been copied time and time again. With the final episodes of one of the greatest TV shows ever made, we thought it'd be a good time to take a look at the incredible set design pieces that helped us believe that 1960's New York was truly an era of Mad Men."
Mid_Century,30g6yg,lukebox,7,Fri Mar 27 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few nice pieces, but it looks so random and slapped together, without much design sense. It just looks kind of messy."
Mid_Century,30g6yg,mgriffioen,3,Fri Mar 27 13:15:03 2015 UTC,I agree with this! As I was going through the photos I was seeing pieces that weren't really shining because of the rest of the clutter around them.

Mid_Century,30g6yg,dorky2,2,Fri Mar 27 13:09:56 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about the ear.  I think if it was more anatomically accurate and had better color, and was standing on a different type of support, it could be really cool.  But it just comes off as weird and kind of gross to me."

Looks like he has a few nice examples of antique furniture but all the light fixtures and wall mounts are the prototypical pieces you see on every modern design website. I've seen two of his clocks and two of the chandeliers on joss and main in the last month alone.
Mid_Century,30g6yg,doublesecretprobatio,14,Fri Mar 27 05:05:23 2015 UTC,"this comment is a prime example of how insufferably snobby this sub is.  ""yeah but his light fixture is so common""."

Mid_Century,30g6yg,Woolio,7,Fri Mar 27 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"My apologies. I should have noted that my imagination in terms of mid-century design, does not exceed far beyond this subreddit.  I don't know any designers. I have no will to own anything I've seen on this subreddit and I've never heard of Joss and Main. I associate mid-century design with The Jetsons and those cushy wooden and leather chairs with the matching foot rest, that are like, $2000."

Whether or not the pieces are prototypical (or cheap, or ugly, or clichÃ©, or knock-offs... what have you) is wholly irrelevant.

Mid_Century,30g6yg,Woolio,2,Fri Mar 27 11:04:58 2015 UTC,I didn't mean it as a bad thing. Just an observation.

Mid_Century,30e61n,riomx,7,Fri Mar 27 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see why you call it an obsession. It would be incredibly bizarre if you were into mcm furniture, found a beautiful piece, and were NOT curious about the designer. Your comment makes it sound like knowing the designer and enjoying the piece are mutually exclusive."
Mid_Century,30e61n,edgestander,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. My comment stems from the frustration of seeing constant low effort shitposts asking people to identify furniture, but offering little else to stimulate discussion. Not to mention that they've dominated the sub in the past few months.  For people who come to the sub for interesting content, but all they see are ID requests, it makes them think that's all this sub has to offer, and gives little incentive for them to consume content or contribute in the future."
Mid_Century,30e61n,paullywaully,2,Thu Mar 26 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm I understand what you're saying, but what you ask is impossible. If you're to control the quality of posts that much, it would have to be a private sub. I personally like these posts. They expose me to new furniture and keep the sub a bit more active. If it weren't for ""identify this"" posts, there would only be one or two submissions a week lol"
Mid_Century,30e61n,riomx,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not actively deleting all of these posts. Some stay because they're relevant enough, but some do get deleted because they contain images of items that don't belong here.  And I think you're getting confused -- I'm not saying that all furniture ID posts are bad. I'm the one that wrote the language on the sidebar encouraging people to submit them in the first place.  The posts I'm talking about are those where people just drop a photo and provide very little information about what they've acquired, but want people to ID it for them."
Mid_Century,30e61n,riomx,11,Fri Mar 27 17:14:52 2015 UTC,I really wish every comment you made was not negative. Whats wrong with trying to ID a piece of furniture? This sub is slow as fuck anyways and adding content only helps.
Mid_Century,30e61n,riomx,4,Sat Mar 28 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Riomx has contributed positively to many of my posts. He is an especially useful asset in rehupolstering advice. I don't think he meant to be negative, but he could have been softer with the phrasing I guess.  I think his sentiment is similar to yours, if you like it, and it works for you then who cares if it was Designed by Jesus himself.  I personally like the ID posts, and like to try and find the maker/designer of my pieces because I like the history, and knowledge picked up through the search.  I met a number of good peopl, and learned a lot, and I eventually found out my plastic chairs were made by Perttu Mentula in Finland. It took a lot of time, and it made no difference really, because I am not selling them.  It's just fun."
Mid_Century,30e61n,riomx,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"I'm the same when it come to knowing the store behind the furniture but I swear every other comment he/she makes is negative. With a sub that is barley active, why would a mod be pushing people away from making posts with legit questions? You think they would be a little more inviting to discussion. Whatever though. I guess I can always use the FB group to get answers and walk from this sub."

Mid_Century,301i6z,TramStopDan,2,Mon Mar 23 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"That's a good tip, but in all honesty, I don't need the exact Joybird version. I just want something the same style/shape."
Mid_Century,301i6z,MsModernity,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"Getting both the color and the angle together might be hard to find but perhaps if you were willing to get a more traditional color sectional like this, you could simply order those tapered legs and get a similar look.   Or the other way, you could get a cute chartreuse sofa that doesn't have the exact angles but once you put on the tapered legs, you'd also get a similar feel.  Third option: find something with good bones at a thrift store and pay to have it reupholstered. Maybe you could find someone to do it for like $1k or so?"
Mid_Century,301i6z,awd3495,2,Tue Mar 24 01:24:17 2015 UTC,"Great ideas. And thanks for the link...that looks promising. As for the reupholstering idea, that was what I was originally planning on doing, and found a couple very good options on Craigslist...however, after buying something on CL for $250-300 and then having it reupholstered, I would end up paying right around $2k+ and it seemed like it would be a better idea to get something new with a retro look. That's why Joybird and the like are so appealing, except for the price tag."

Mid_Century,2zemc0,kenfar,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"I've had a number of heywood wakefield dining room sets over the years and really like them.   The champaign finish is the most in demand.  It used to be extremely expensive to refinish them, but a number of companies are now selling premixed finishes that make it much easier to refinish this.  Since the wood is very hard, and the lines are simple - refinishing this furniture is something anyone can do.  I've found that it wears really well (we raised a family using this furniture).  But the old finish can be fragile, and can wear off if you're not gentle with it.  I had some plexiglass custom-cut into sections to sit on top of the table and protect it from kids.  That worked really well."
Mid_Century,2zemc0,FuzzyHappyBunnies,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:53:20 2015 UTC,Buy it. I have the exact table and chairs (along with a lovely china cabinet). It's a good price.

Mid_Century,2zd9gm,edgestander,3,Tue Mar 17 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't say firm there is wiggle room. I agree that these look like standard pieces from the time period, ie lane, basset, winchendon ect.   I disagree with Shakes in that I dont nessicarilly think veneer make the credenza less desirable. This has been stated before, but many desireable mid century pieces use veneer, it isn't really a sign of poor quality.  Look for how the joints are connected, how heavy is the piece, how smoothly do the doors open, ect.  At retail I would think the credenza would sell for about $400, I usually try to pay 1/3 of retail on CR so I would go $150 on that, the chair is tougher, but I would pop on $50-$75 for the chair so maybe offer $250, I probably wouldn't go higher, but I am in the Midwest so if you are easy or west coast you might want to adjust up. I don't like to discuss price with the seller until I see the item, then use your knowledge to justify the price: no makers marks, damage. Also remember that you have cash and the ability to take what they don't want so you have the upper hand in negotiating. Good luck."
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,edgestander,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"I figured it was fairly standard fare, but it never hurts to ask! :) I have to be honest, though...I've been looking at resale shops and classifieds for a little while now....and it seems like the market here is slim pickings! Mostly tasteless repaints, shabby chic, and awful Target/Urban Outfitters furniture seems to get sold at this price point. So I have absolutely no idea what ANY of this stuff is actually ""worth"" xD everyone thinks  This seems like great advice. I wasn't planning on discussing price until I saw everything in person...Plus it seems like it would be easier to negotiate a lower price in person.   Thanks tons. I'll take this into consideration :)"
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,darryljenks,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"You are exactly right!  The price is largely determined by your local market and what it will support.  You are smart to do your homework and look at sales.  Sometimes I will go on live auctioneers.com and find some ""comps"", this gives a better idea of what similar items sell for in a non-retail setting.  They show price history free as long as you register."
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,Shakes8993,3,Wed Mar 18 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"Update: I wound up purchasing both of these items! The credenza was solid wood with walnut veneer. He had taken impeccable care of it. There was only a tiny chip on the right side that is only visible if you take the sliding door out. He had tightened the legs He even gave me a bottle of Murphy Oil to clean it with. The chair was smaller than I expected (a good thing) and very comfortable. The chair had just been shampooed, he had all receipts, and the legs of the credenza are even adjustable  I have yet to look at the receipts. But I wound up paying 320 for everything. Which I thought was fair."
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,glasgow015,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen either of them before, though the credenza is pretty standard looking for that period. It's hard to estimate the quality of the items from those pictures. I'm guessing that the credenza is veneer, so you won't be able to sand it down too much, if the surface has marks. The price seems reasonable if you like the items, but you can always try to talk the price down a bit."
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,Shakes8993,0,Tue Mar 17 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"whoa.. you think it's a reasonable price for veneer? For that price I would expect it to be solid wood. It is really hard to tell quality from those pics but it doesn't look like veneer anyway. Just my opinion.   Usually I get my stuff at estate auctions or regular auctions but I have seen pieces like this before with regular sellers. Now, keep in mind this is in a bigger city which sometimes raises the prices for uncommon things. IE. selling something in New York or Toronto is going to get you more money than if you were trying to sell in Bugfuck, Nowhere. I've seen very similar solid walnut credenzas go for around $200-250. The chair, if a look alike, should be $60-80. I'm in Canada so this would be in our dollars."
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,riomx,3,Tue Mar 17 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Don't let a a prejudice against veneer keep you from getting good pieces. I have a Grete Jalk coffee table that is veneer that I really like. Most the big danish designers used veneer often, Eames products are generally veneer. The obsession with 'solid wood' as indication of quality is mostly a recent phenomenon (starting in the 80's) propagated by furniture sales people. Accomplished designers working for high end companies use veneer all the time. It is hard to refinish without the proper equipment and skill so for refurbishing projects I tend to go for the solid wood American stuff myself."

Upon reflection, I don't hate it, it's just that I prefer solid wood. I, too, have a Grete Jalk side table but mine is solid wood.. teak. I got it in an auction lot. To be honest, it seemed like they put it in the lot to hold the rest of the stuff. They barely mentioned the table in the description (it was an online estate auction) and didn't even say it was teak. In fact, the table was covered with a bunch of knickknacks and a blanket. Got it for $8 CDN"

Mid_Century,2zd9gm,F-That,2,Thu Mar 19 04:50:44 2015 UTC,Most good furniture is vaneer. Solid wood warps and cracks and is way expensive. Even the good designers and furniture manufacturers used vaneer.
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,Shakes8993,0,Tue Mar 17 22:47:58 2015 UTC,to each his own I guess. I personally hate it. Was just talking with my wife about it 15 minutes ago.

Mid_Century,2zd9gm,Shakes8993,0,Wed Mar 18 00:34:58 2015 UTC,"Funny that we are having this conversation.. I just went to the local Value Village tonight and picked up a dresser in the style and I could tell by taking out a drawer and looking underneath the the top. It's mainly to see if it's real wood and what I am dealing with when it comes to refinishing (which I do a lot of the time as thrift store condition isn't great). There are a couple of other things that bother me about it but it's mostly due to refinishing problems..  Essentially, I don't have the money to buy everything in great condition. If I can get a dresser for $10-$20, refinish it and add it to my ""collection"" or sell it for 10 - 15 times, I would rather do that. It's fun and it can be quite satisfying when someone gives you a lot of money for work that you've done. Money isn't bad either ;)"
Mid_Century,2zd9gm,serpentineminer,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"Man. You're essentially applying a misguided blanket of hate on a ton of mid century furniture.   The 20th century was a period when industrial design and manufacturing made leaps with techniques including layering and shaping plywood; and veneering to make durable, but lighter furniture that was easier to manufacture in greater quantities.  If you hate veneer, you hate iconic pieces including the Eames Lounge Chair, the Eames Molded Plywood Lounge Chair and George Nelson's Omni and CSS units."

Mid_Century,2z7yw1,SnowblindAlbino,2,Mon Mar 16 14:29:47 2015 UTC,I have a flat roof and live in Utah. Well it has a very slight pitch to it. Materials these days can hold up no problem. I would be more worried about the insulating of the large windows. Trying to keep the cold out in the winter and cold in during the summer may be an issue.
Mid_Century,2z7yw1,F-That,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:08:18 2015 UTC,"Triple-pane insulated glass, which is what they use in most modern highrises* in colder climates, could handle that easily.   Really, Eichler homes only need a handful of very slight modifications to be viable in almost any region. The snow thing becomes an issue at a certain point, but making the roof darker fixes that almost entirely.   Insulate them well, and they'll hold up just fine.   *This only applies to highrises that don't use glass curtain techniques. Glass curtain only allows for single-pane windows."
Mid_Century,2z7yw1,Woolio,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:17:27 2015 UTC,Yeah you can also use heat trace cable on the roof and never have to worry about snowpack. I just wish you could build one for $100-$200K.
Mid_Century,2z7yw1,F-That,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"They can't be that expensive to build, can they? Average residential cost around here's about $110/sq.ft. Most Eichlers are only 2000sq.ft, so it theoretically shouldn't be more expensive than a standard house. Maybe a bit more, since there's a lot of custom glass, but a lot of the construction is fairly basic. You'd be looking maybe 10% over the cost of a normal house, assuming you got good rates on the glass."
Mid_Century,2z7yw1,Woolio,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"Commercial windows work fine; I have a 12x7 foot window next to my office and it insulated pretty well. They aren't cheap, but nobody is going to build an Eichler on a modest budget.  Flat roof is OK until you have 100"" of snow like Boston!"
Mid_Century,2z7yw1,SnowblindAlbino,3,Mon Mar 16 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Love this article. Also makes me wonder what other 'resurrected' classic home plans are available.
Mid_Century,2z8gkp,Richienyc718,3,Mon Mar 16 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's hardly salvageable, and it's not worth salvaging. The tiered tables, although certainly one of the hallmarks of mid-century furniture, are just sort of junk now. They were never built particularly well, and no notable designers made one.   Even in better condition, that would only fetch $20 or so, and you're looking at hundreds of dollars in veneer work to get it to that shape."

Also, my wife kindly reminded me that we don't have any room to store it, which I sort of ignored in all my enthusiasm :-)  I requested an ID at the Design Addict forum. They said it's probably a quite common Belgian production unit with little value. All in all it wasn't worth it. I sent the seller an e-mail to explain that he might still get some money for it though."

Mid_Century,2z2mzi,riomx,4,Sun Mar 15 18:01:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this chair is just mid century junk. It is not by a designer with a name. It is probably just designed by some in-house designer at one of the many generic American furniture companies from the period. It is not a collectable piece but of course if you like it then by all means keep it and live with it.
Mid_Century,2z2mzi,riomx,6,Sun Mar 15 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.. though I'm going to have to disagree with your use of the term ""junk"".

I just like the style of the furniture I get. I could care less if it's signed by anyone. I've found that there is a lot of the unsigned, non-Danish stuff here in Canada. Well made items put together by small companies in northern Ontario dominate the market. I've picked up a couple of pieces that were mcm style that work perfectly in my music listening area.

Mid_Century,2z00ov,a_lo602,13,Sat Mar 14 07:26:51 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what that is, or what it's knocking off. Let me dig up some pictures.   Percival Lafer, a Brazillian furniture designer who was inspired by Le Corbusier's South American lecture tour, founded a furniture company and designed a unique range of modernist furniture built with traditional Brazillian materials and influences. The result is a bizarre aesthetic of overstuffed, plush furniture that looks... About like yours, really.   The biggest difference I see is the dowel legs. Lafer S.A. never used dowel legs, they always used board/plank legs, as you can see here.   He was, and still is considered one of the most influential South American modernists, and helped kickstart the South American Internationalist movement.  Your chair looks like a knockoff, but it looks to be pretty good quality. I'd say it's probably from somewhere in Europe or the US."
Mid_Century,2z00ov,Woolio,1 point,Sat Mar 14 07:38:23 2015 UTC,We have had 3 Percival Lafer chairs and loveseats pop up at the local thrift stores in the last 2 weeks. They were not salvageable so I left them.

Mid_Century,2yiybc,cynicallad,9,Tue Mar 10 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"That's because they're just mass-produced stools that were available in the mid-20th century.   If you're just starting out, I recommend dropping the assumption that items that happen to have an organic or playful design common in the 50s and 60s are famous or designer pieces.  Companies 50-60 years ago made accessble furniture just like we have companies pumping out affordable furniture today.  EDIT: Forgot to add why -- if you don't become more familiar with furniture, you may end up spending quite a bit of money on items you thought were valuable but really aren't. But as long as you're enjoying them, that's all that matters."
Mid_Century,2yiybc,riomx,3,Tue Mar 10 06:00:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. You're gruff, but I sense it comes from a good place.   My research has shown that these are most like Cosco pieces, which is exactly as you described. I don't think they're worth millions, but I do think they're worth more than $40, because they're undeniably vintage, and there are a lot of vintage collectors in LA. By the same token, I just flipped a piece of Ikea furniture -not because it's rare, but because someone needed it and liked it.  My question to you: do you think these are worth significantly less than $40? Remember, I got them at Goodwill. They're 100% returnable.  I post to learn (again, thank you), to have more fun on reddit, and as a safeguard - occassionally I find something that is rare (see my Don Shoemaker tray) and I wouldn't want to end up flipping it for $20 bucks because I want pizza."
Mid_Century,2yiybc,riomx,6,Tue Mar 10 06:25:18 2015 UTC,"because they're undeniably vintage   Just because something is old doesn't make it valuable. But if someone can make money because they can convince someone that it's more special because it's ""vintage,"" more power to them.  I personally wouldn't spend $40 on them, but that's because of personal preference. Someone that likes kitsch and ""atomic"" styling probably would love them.  I like a certain aesthetic, but I'm also not someone that pursues only designer furniture. I like to find well-made furniture that meshes well with my existing decor.   Also, I like projects and the challenge of making something that is outdated or abused look nicer. The chairs you bought look nice and sturdy. Though naugahyde is a good material, the color isn't so nice. I think they could look very good with some polishing and reupholstering in blue, white or even orange depending on the space they'll go."

If you think you can resell these for more than $40 - even after reupholstering, I think that would be tough (crazy. I wouldn't consider these. But if you LOVE them).  Are you new to MCM furniture? I was new when I found this subreddit. I bought a ton of stuff that I realized within 6 months wasn't special. Luckily I was able to resell most of those things on Craigslist but now I'm more careful and kinda wish I had been more cautious and careful from the beginning.. which was all advice that some ass hole gave me on this subreddit months ago and I thought they were grumpy-grumps but now I know they were RIGHT. : )"

Mid_Century,2y963y,callmesnake13,3,Sun Mar 8 07:35:24 2015 UTC,"Chrome & red was a rather common combination in the 60's and 70's. Famous example 1 and famous example 2. Because of new iconic furniture being radically new kind of design, during those times smaller producers also experimented a lot with different forms, so there are a lot of 60's and 70's furniture that look unique.  Also, the fabric being like velvet/plush like material indicates 70's as it was quite common for at that time. Example 1, example 2, example 3, example 4, example 5 & example 6."
Mid_Century,2y963y,Toppo,3,Sun Mar 8 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"I know that chrome and red has existed in furniture before the 90's, but this example in particular really looks like the kind of thing you see in ""vintage looking"" furniture stores that sell fake tulip chairs and whatnot. If I'm wrong I'll happily accept it though."
Mid_Century,2y963y,callmesnake13,5,Sun Mar 8 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Well, they already did tulip chair, ball chair, womb chair etc. imitations in the 70's and I would guess that OP's chair is one of those 70's non-designer chairs riding on the popularity of famous design elements and trend created by others. I'm not saying that OP's chair is something valuable and collectible, but because of the velvet it definitely looks more 70's than 90's, as 70's velvet furniture wasn't that popular in the 90's and wasn't imitated so much during that time.  70's also was a transitional period between mid century and late 20th century design. Many 70's designs start to have elements that became popular in the 80's and had an influence in the 90's furniture. For example Milo Baughmans 70's furniture like this and this (which have similar design language as OP's chair) already starts to have stronger geometric design forms which are apparent in Baughmans 80's designs like this and this. Now, 80's and 90's furniture isn't popular yet (but they will be), as for many the furniture of 80's and 90's is tacky and ugly, so furniture from the 70's anticipating the design forms of the 80's and 90's can strike us as 90's ugly furniture. For example I'd guess that for many this 70's chair strikes as more 80's and 90's style than mid century modern, because it already starts to show more the forms prevalent in the 80's and 90's than mid century forms.  EDIT: I did some googling, and what I said was even more right than I thought. Apparently OP's chairs are designed by Milo Baughman, designed in the 70's for Thayer Coggin. Identical (except the fabric) chairs identified as Baughmans can be seen here, here and here. Baughman designed for several decades, his style spanning from mid-century to lat 20th century modern."

So I asked them for a leather sample and pictures of the actual product rather than just stock photos. The sample and the pictures checked out so I took the plunge. They have since pulled the listing so I'm not sure if I bought the last one or what. Either way, I couldn't be happier with it. The look is spot on, it's shock mounted, and the leather is like butter.

MHD with full aniline leather is almost twice the price of this chair and Amazon gives 12 months free financing on orders over $599 when you use the Amazon store card.

Mid_Century,2y1p9q,theansweris_fortytwo,5,Fri Mar 6 19:52:14 2015 UTC,Depends on personal preference. Full aniline is the most supple but least durable. You don't want aniline if you have pets or little kids - it'll get destroyed.

The cushions are removable, which was important to me when considering buying. The leather seems good, but I have little experience with leather so take that with a grain of salt. The tufting in the cushions isn't quite as deep as the original, but it's much better than the cheaper repro's I looked at. It also doesn't have much flex when leaning back, I've heard that the authentic one does, though I'm not sure.

I happen to be from the area, so I picked this out when I was home for Christmas.  They will deliver anywhere nationwide that is within 100 miles of ANY R&B store for $89.  So I got this delivered from Minneapolis to Maryland for less than standard delivery at lots of furniture places.  I can't recommend their service enough."

Mid_Century,2xxi9j,IgnoreAmos,2,Wed Mar 4 21:29:49 2015 UTC,How does their quality compare to stuff like West Elm?
Mid_Century,2xxi9j,noahfencetaken,2,Thu Mar 5 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"I love both, but I can vouch that my R&B pieces are even better quality.  Plus, a lot of it is made in the US, which I look for, to try and support our own industries."
Mid_Century,2xxi9j,newredditcauseangela,2,Thu Mar 5 16:27:51 2015 UTC,R&B is better quality but its also more expensive.
Mid_Century,2xxi9j,fuzzymumbochops,2,Thu Mar 5 16:41:57 2015 UTC,"As a woodworker, R&B is much better quality. They use mostly solid wood for their furniture, while West Elm uses mostly veneers. West Elm stuff that I has tends to be more IKEA-esque, meaning it comes in pieces that can be easily assembled and disassembled. R&B is definitely not that. It's usually permanently assembled with professional joinery. It's good stuff."
Mid_Century,2xxi9j,IgnoreAmos,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"As other commenters have mentioned, Room and Board is certainly better quality.  However, it is more expensive.  I shopped around for credenzas for a long time, and I looked seriously at a few from both CB2 and West Elm.  At the end of the day, I feel like modern veneered furniture is not as durable.  I wanted something that will last me a really long time, so I splurged for the solid wood.  This particular piece is solid walnut with a wax and oil finish, so I can easily maintain the wood with occasional touch up with some feed and wax, and if it ever needs a refinishing in the future the solid wood with withstand the process.    The delivery service is A+.  It comes full assembled and they were very careful unloading it off the truck and putting in place in my apartment.  The delivery guy even gave the piece a nice wipe down with danish oil on the day of delivery.  I am really impressed with the company, and if I ever need to purchase more furniture in the future I am going to go to them first."

If you grab that with a pair of vice grips, it should twist right out. Is the leg bad enough it can't be reglued? I've fixed these frequently, gluing the crack and putting a dowel in the hole, then redrilling for the lag bolt.   If the leg is beyond repair, I typically use VanDykes for replacement parts.  Edit: It's not bad removing these lag bolts from existing legs. If I'm saving the bolt, I'll use two nuts, tighten the top nut to the bottom, then use a wrench on the bottom nut with the leg held in a vice. You can also stick it directly in the chuck of a drill, but make sure you have the leg securely held."

Mid_Century,2wy6vk,fast4ward,6,Tue Feb 24 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"The Eames Lounge has always gone for around today's price, adjusted for inflation. Reason being, they're not the cheapest or easiest chairs to build. I've always kind of wondered how they were able to get the price down to under $1000, since the authentic chair's got a materials cost of around $1200, not including labor.   I guess you really do get what you pay for when you try to cut corners. It's like buying a Cobra kit for a Beetle chassis; yes, it looks like a Cobra, but underneath it's a completely different, crappier beast."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,Woolio,6,Wed Feb 25 01:07:40 2015 UTC,"If they're being made from MDF or some shitty composite wood like OP is saying, that totally makes sense why they're so cheap.  I've never thought of purchasing a new reproduction, but I've seen plenty of them in person and they've always looked like garbage. Now I know that they are essentially 100% garbage."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,riomx,2,Wed Feb 25 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm hedging my bets on OSB, MDF doesn't have the structure to support that kind of pressure. I've seen OSB used in furniture of all sorts before, though, and it always breaks down after about five years.   The earlier repros that were made in the US weren't bad, from what I've heard, but after all that was outsourced the quality dropped hard. Nobody builds furniture like furniture anymore. Kind of a shame, really."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,Woolio,4,Wed Feb 25 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what OSB is but if these chairs are MDF that's shocking. Correct me if I'm wrong but the originals are steam-moulded birch ply with a teak veneer. Marine grade - The same shit they made planes from.  I'm honestly going to post every bargain price, distressed Eames Lounge chair I see in the sale rooms in this sub from now on.  You can get a real one cheaply !"
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,Woolio,2,Thu Feb 26 03:02:26 2015 UTC,"OSB is basically mulch that's been glued together. It's got some tensile strength, but not a lot. Still better than MDF, though, which is essentially really thick paper.   And yeah, you're entirely right. The Eameses made quality stuff, it's why I'm able to sit in one of the chairs they built 60 years ago without it having fallen apart. Problem is, quality ain't cheap."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,vincent_vancough,3,Thu Feb 26 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"There is a dealer local to me who sells repros of the Eames lounge, but he did not give me a brand when I asked (which is a bad sign). From some of the research I have done, Rove concepts seems to adhere to the original design, but I have never handled a chair by Rove or even a legit HM chair for that matter.   I also have had 2 Selig Eames lounge reproductions and they both have thin plywood shells that cracked where the base met the seat, which is miserable. Also vintage repros usually have vinyl upholstery, poor padding and a bad seat angle which is all far inferior to aniline leather original."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,riomx,4,Wed Feb 25 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Early Seligs and Plycrafts suck. But Plydesigns and later Selig chairs were made with thick plywood.  I won't make any claims that my vintage reproduction is incredible in any way, but in the late 60s and into the 70s, Plydesigns and Selig became much more brazen. See below:  http://imgur.com/a/5H6EH  http://imgur.com/a/MhaC3  My chair is heavy, solid and thick. I've sat and stressed it plenty of times, including sitting quickly on it to see if anything would happen and it hasn't.  I'd recommend anyone looking for a vintage reproduction to skip early Selig and Plycrafts. Look for later reproductions that are closer to the proportions of a Herman Miller chair."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,riomx,3,Thu Feb 26 08:13:01 2015 UTC,"I've never actually seen a Plydesigns tag, and there's very little info on the net about them. Do you have the tag for that chair? How did you know it was manufactured by Plydesigns?  When I was young, my parents had a replica Eames which fit the true dimensions much better and had loose polyester filling (like a pillow), not foam. I've seen one Selig that might match that description, but I haven't actually seen a Plydesigns lounger. Your chair has that same filling, which I found to be very comfortable (real Eames use pillows as well, but I believe actual feathers?)."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,vincent_vancough,3,Fri Feb 27 00:04:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like they were an obscure company out of Ontario. The only reason I found out was because /u/killdie posted an album of a chair he found that still had the tag on it.  http://imgur.com/a/6oiNg  They're very similar to later Selig chairs, but the giveaway is that they always have four star bases on the chairs, whereas Selig chairs always have five legs.  Also, you're right -- early Herman Miller chairs did use feather filling, but they later used cushions."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,golgiiguy,2,Fri Feb 27 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks riomx, that's solved a riddle for me. If I remember correctly, my parent's chair had a 5-point base, so it was likely Selig version. It was built very well and we put it through a lot of abuse (perhaps more than I'm willing to admit). We sold it long ago and I'm on the lookout for one now."
Mid_Century,2wy6vk,wickedpissa,2,Fri Feb 27 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"Damn, your chair looks really nice. The use of rosewood is a surprising touch."

Mid_Century,2wm917,TwistedMemories,5,Sat Feb 21 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"Touch that kitchen and I'll hunt you down! Why? Because I love the retro look of it. How it has a wonderful dish display much like my grandparents place had. The chrome trim is wonderful along with the nail heads.  A lot of retro kitchens have greenish cabinet doors, or red, but that looks more goldish or a deep dijon mustard brown. The counter tops remind me of my grandparents table (wish I could find a picture of  it) as it was also green like that.   I take that the stove was also original? Seems to be from the rounded corner I can see. Perhaps you have a photo of that as well?   I could go on how wonderful it looks, like the metal drying area. And the lights, but I won't. Thanks for sharing."
Mid_Century,2wm917,TwistedMemories,2,Sat Feb 21 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, it is a fantastic mustard colour isn't it? After pulling up all of the hideous lino and polishing all the floors I'm actually really happy with how the kitchen looks. Our first renovation priority is the bathroom so I think that kitchen will live on for at least another decade yet. The oven isn't original but it's a cheap bottom of the line model and I swear they haven't changed their design since the 50s so it fits in really well. The sink area is fantastic, it runs nearly the full length of the window. So whilst we don't have any mod cons like a dishwasher we do have plenty of space for dishes!"
Mid_Century,2wm917,Woolio,3,Sat Feb 21 21:04:50 2015 UTC,"It is. Much nicer than an American yellow. The floor had lino? How ghastly that must of been and terrible for covering such a wonderful floor. It looks wonderful polished as it is.  I did notice a bit inconsistency in the tile, though it maybe the lighting and angle. Still I would love to have that kitchen."
Mid_Century,2wm917,torknorggren,4,Sun Feb 22 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"I love that fireplace. Reminds me of a diving helmet. Probably kicks out a ton of heat, too, so I'd consider getting that in working order if you live in a colder region."
Mid_Century,2wm917,yourmommo,4,Sat Feb 21 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. Looks like an old-school airtight, and a pretty decent size at that. Should put out enough BTUs to heat a 2000 ft. home at least."
Mid_Century,2wm917,darktrain,2,Sat Feb 21 06:19:54 2015 UTC,Aparently they do throw out a ton of heat but we have a (somewhat dopey) dog so I wouldn't be comfotable using it without a guard and that would take away too much from the room. Instead we've put in an insert wood heater into the old open fireplace in the lounge and we'll leave this one to just look pretty!
Mid_Century,2wm917,yourmommo,3,Sat Feb 21 13:36:55 2015 UTC,The house was built in 1940 with an extension added to the back of the house in the early 60s.  The house had only had one owner until we bought it a couple of months ago and it seemed that nothing had been changed since the 60s.    Here's a bonus shot of a newspaper clipping found under the layers and layers of lino and carpet in the front room.  The earliest newspapers we discovered dated back to 1937!

Mid_Century,2wlkin,sewnlurk,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"I would be tempted to try this myself. I have done upholstery before. If you are a beginner you would probably find the covered buttons and the piping to be difficult. Personally I would recover it with one of the new microsuedes. They are tough as iron and liquids just roll off. Wonderful stuff.  If you have never tried this kind of thing I would hire it done. Take your photos to some local shops and see how much they quote you. Upholstery isn't hard if you have the equipment on hand. If you don't have the equipment it's cheaper to hire someone. And this is a fiddly job, you are going to be happier paying a pro to do it."

Imagine my surprise when I started studying design and realized my grandparent's house was a veritable museum of danish modern!  The PH pendants are incredibly ubiquitous in danish homes, though I feel like I've seen more of the artichokes in the US.  Also, I suggest you x-post this to /r/architecture and or /r/design where it may get a livelier response!  edit: forgot to thank you for posting those vids! I enjoyed them a lot!"
Mid_Century,2wle7o,F-That,2,Sat Feb 21 04:19:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just posted it in r/design. What I liked about the videos was seeing how PH saw light. I found the sections where he talked about snow, how light changes through the day and what he deemed to be ideal home lighting to be mesmerizing. I hope to visit Denmark sometime in the future for sure.  I'd love to see your mid century furniture and other items sometime!"
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,Fifflesticks,5,Sat Feb 21 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"What a great and inexpensive find! This is a lovely piece of furniture. Your grandma was very sweet to pick it up with you in mind and I love that you're already thinking of keeping it long enough to pass on to your own kids. I think that shows how much you appreciate the piece and your grandmother and I think it's impressive that you realize this already (while probably not owning it for very long). In 10+ years you might be doing your makeup at the mirror and remember that your grandma thought of you when she saw it on the side of the road and then your memory will run wild with other happy grandma memories. (This happens for me when I eat M&Ms for the first time in a long while, because my beloved PopPop would give me a big bag of M&Ms whenever we visited him).   All that being said from an obviously sentimental person :)  - please do NOT paint this piece. : )  I think that would take away from the timelessness of the vanity. If you want to stencil or paint something, buy something dumpy at Target or Walmart or at a thrift store that's in horrible shape to play around with : )  - not this special piece.  : )  (and this subreddit [including myself!] HATES the idea of painting furniture, which is why some folks reacted a little.. impatiently)"
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,SARASA05,3,Sat Feb 21 06:42:57 2015 UTC,What a lovely memory that you have of your poppop! I enjoyed reading this comment very much and I thank you :)   I am a sentimental person as well and I absolutely don't want to ruin the piece and I think and hope my daughter will appreciate this too.   I've had it for 6/7 months now and that's exactly why I came here asking what i should/could do to fix it up! I am going to wax it like a PP suggested.   I didn't mean to upset anyone by asking I just didn't really know what I could do with it. I bet it looks great after waxing!
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,riomx,1 point,Sat Feb 21 07:07:50 2015 UTC,"does anyone recognize it? I have no idea if it's antique or anything else about it  I've had it for a while now and Im thinking i want to fix it up a little. suggestions are welcome :) should i paint it, color, stencils etc."
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,Woolio,9,Sat Feb 21 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"This is /r/ArtDeco   And no, please don't paint it. Why would you do that?"
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,Woolio,3,Sat Feb 21 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"Whoops, sorry.. A friend referred me to this sub. I thought it was more 50/60s instead of 20/30s"
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,Woolio,4,Sat Feb 21 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't paint it. Please. Just give it a nice waxing, and it'll look almost brand new. If you want to get more involved, you can strip the varnish off with something like soygel and recoat it in Danish Oil or similar. That's a ton of work, especially on a piece of this size, but if you really want to fix it up that's the way to go.   These were really popular in the 20s-30s, and they go for quite a bit today. If you don't want to maintain it, it's a seller's market."
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,doublesecretprobatio,5,Sat Feb 21 03:07:32 2015 UTC,I did polish it already but did not wax. Any recommendations for a wax? I think I will try that first and see how it looks.   I'm really not into selling it I just can't bear to part with it! I think I will hand it down to my daughter when she's old enough for makeup
Mid_Century,2wm1ty,doublesecretprobatio,4,Sat Feb 21 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, SC Johnson has been making some pretty decent furniture wax now for the better part of the last century. My great uncle swore by it."

Mid_Century,2whdri,Toppo,4,Thu Feb 19 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"This is the series ""Ultima Thule"" by Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala. Originally this line was designed for the Finnish airline Finnair in the end of the 60's but has since been a popular item in Finland. Tapio Wirkkala was a Finnish designer most known for his glass designs. When in some glass design exhibitions in Italy, during dinner banquets he ate flowers to cultivate the idea of an exotic Nordic designer.  This particular bow is chipped on the edge, but still 3,5â¬ is a small price for an damaged Ultima Thule bowl."

It has a single piece of glass instead of that extra piece of metal in the middle.    Its lost its kick over the years (20+ minutes to boil water), but it still looks great."
Mid_Century,2wg86w,WildeCat96,2,Fri Feb 20 03:32:11 2015 UTC,"Corning Model K-32. Known as ""The Counter That Cooks""  I've seen elsewhere that these were actually made by Modern Maid, not Corning and that Corning Glass Works just made the surface. It is in early 70's catalogs from Corning though. To my knowledge, this was the first (or at least in the first series) of glass flat cooktops ever made.  (see here: http://www.corellecorner.com/corning-ware-advertisements-catalogues/494-1972-corning-cooktops-ranges.html)  This was in the house when we moved in. After a good scouring, it turned out to be in remarkably good condition.   We ended up pulling it out for a couple of reasons, primarily because we have young children and since the elements don't light up, it's difficult to tell if the cooktop is hot or not. Seemed like an accident waiting to happen. I do have the other knobs, but can't find them at the moment.   Pictures didn't turn out as well as I hoped. Basement was dim and I didn't feel like lugging it upstairs."
Mid_Century,2wg86w,RetroCorning,4,Thu Feb 19 17:53:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting the picture! If I wasnt a gas cooktop person then I would be making an offer on it!  This was quite an engineering marvel at the time being able to rapidly heat and cool a piece of glass without it breaking. It was one of the first Gorilla Glass that we all carry around in our pocket now.
Mid_Century,2wg86w,Dildorthemagnificent,3,Thu Feb 19 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty remarkable how ahead of it's time it was. It's not really for sale at the moment. Just hording for now. Might end up putting it back in once the kids are older. Though, like you - I prefer gas."

Mid_Century,2wcqqc,Hodaka,6,Thu Feb 19 08:01:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Making abstract graphic art is much more difficult than it seems. It's like the egg of Columbus. It seems easy when you look at the results, but it's actually hard to come up with it. Making DIY abstract art has the risk of ending up just like a mess. Of course DIY blogs just post the most brilliant results. There are tons and tons of failed attempts behind every post about good DIY."

My mid-century house does not have anywhere enough light and I am struggling to find a way to put more built-in illumination without ruining the appearance of the ceiling.  Surface mount like yours would be one solution but I don't want it to detract from the aesthetic."
Mid_Century,2w84dy,opabiniarex,3,Wed Feb 18 05:30:50 2015 UTC,There was a couple of accordions but they must have been very nice as they were pricey.   The surface mount was one thing I did notice but it is done very well with some old heavy steel wire track that I don't think you could find today. They must have been there for quite awhile but its one of those function over forms for us. The added light and the lights themselves are so great I can deal with a little wire track.

Mid_Century,2vxta2,F-That,2,Mon Feb 16 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think they've since deleted their post, but someone submitted a post after taking delivery of their custom Joybird sofa (I wonder if they returned it and got a refund?). It was nearly identical in style to Younger Furniture's Louie Sofa, but about 5x shittier in regard to quality.  The Joybird sofa had obviously been rushed and had ruffles from the upholstery not being done correctly. And from what I recall, it wasn't cheap.  If I were buying a new sofa, I would not buy from Joybird based on what I saw posted here on the subreddit. A poorly made sofa will always bother you every time you look at it."
Mid_Century,2vxta2,riomx,2,Tue Feb 17 02:57:31 2015 UTC,I've been wondering the same thing and was hoping to see some first hand reviews/feedback. Been looking for a new couch and they had some styles the wife and I quite like.
Mid_Century,2vxta2,crogginator,4,Tue Feb 17 14:33:53 2015 UTC,I bought a couch through them. I'll let you know how I like it once it arrives!

Mid_Century,2vxta2,kerklein2,2,Tue Apr 7 13:25:03 2015 UTC,"Soon! By the 27th! What's cool is they send you an email every step of the way. They built the frame, cut the fabric, upholstered it, and now it's in QC. From there, once it's approved, they'll call and schedule shipping. I can't wait!"

Mid_Century,2vwhek,obamapastry,2,Sun Feb 15 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"Converted to pounds, that's around 650 pounds.  I definitely did not spend 1600 dollars which is what the rove chair cost.  I figure if they are using real aniline leather and nicer metal and wood parts, it should give me 20-30 years of use.  By then I'll be able to afford the real version but there's no way I can afford one any time soon."
Mid_Century,2vwhek,obamapastry,3,Sun Feb 15 14:22:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant dollars I'm just used to using GBP.  I don't think I could spend that much as I'd know that once I eventually bought the real thing the repro would be a moot point. I'd be spending the money on something different but something I'd still love once I could afford a real Eames. That being said, if it really is 20-30 years till you'd be able to afford an original then go for it."
Mid_Century,2vwhek,obamapastry,2,Sun Feb 15 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't spend $1000/Â£650 on a replica because what are you buying, really? It is the quality that made the design famous, not a sleek design that owners came to appreciate for its quality.   Why not buy yourself a knackered old genuine Eames shell and invest a little in a skilled reupholstery and restoration expert?  The preoccupation with repro items in this sub is a little worrying. You'd hope we were all purists in here!"
Mid_Century,2vwhek,riomx,3,Mon Feb 16 21:54:01 2015 UTC,Why not buy yourself a knackered old genuine Eames shell and invest a little in a skilled reupholstery and restoration expert?   This. I have a friend who reupholstered a Rob Parry using leather he stripped from an ugly Gumtree sofa he bought for Â£30. It looked great and was really cheap.
Mid_Century,2vwhek,riomx,2,Mon Feb 16 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well, we're not. Though I appreciate and respect designers, it doesn't make sense for me (personally) to spend $3 - $5,000 on a chair, regardless of whether I have that cash on hand or not.  Also, you make it sound like finding Eames Lounge Chairs in disrepair is easy and cheap. It isn't. Because of their desirability, even abused chairs still yield hundreds or thousands of dollars (I'll never forget the 70s Eames Lounge Chair I found at a local shop that had scratches all over the shells and non-existent cushions that was going for $2,500), so they don't make good projects unless you enjoy throwing money away. By the time you're finished with materials and repairs, you could have just purchased a new chair.  I picked up an old Plydesigns chair for $100 that was abused and in tatters. I sanded and refinished all surfaces and I completely redid all upholstery and buttons on every cushion. I kept my costs low for materials, cleaned and repurposed hardware, and most of what I spent on was on acquiring necessary tools.   I now have a comfortable chair that I enjoyed restoring and don't feel bad about if my kids or animals bump into it every now and then. It serves a purpose and I'm happy with it, and there are many others like me on this subreddit.  If we were all on the other extreme and strictly only liked high end designer objects, this community would be much less active than it already is. Some of us are enthusiasts and passionate about acquiring only designer pieces, but it's safe to assume that most people are middle-of-the-road or are just learning.  However, there is a community that you may feel more at home in. Check out the Design Addict forums. You'll find plenty of ""pleasant"" people who share your philosophy on acquiring modern designs.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I was writing this from my Herman Miller Aluminum Group chair. Having reproductions doesn't make you an evil person :)"
Mid_Century,2vwhek,fast4ward,3,Tue Feb 17 00:29:15 2015 UTC,"You don't have to spend thousands to find a ratty old Eames shell, but it will take time. Maybe check www.liveauctioneers.com or www.thesaleroom.com   And I'm not 'obsessed with high end design' as you've insinuated. You're the one that wants the fake Eames!  I haven't spent more than Â£400/$600 on anything in my house. Most of my stuff is Original mass-produced, 40's-60's English/Danish/Dutch. I don't own a single piece from Vitra or Knoll.  All I'm saying is would you buy a fake Louis Vuitton bag for your wife? What about fake Jordan's for your kid? If you answered yes to both those, then by all means get a fake Eames."
Mid_Century,2vwhek,riomx,2,Tue Feb 17 07:31:44 2015 UTC,"I did not post anywhere here saying that I am shopping for reproductions. I answered questions on this thread about reproductions.  Also, I don't know where you're getting that I would buy fake luxury items altogether -- I restored a vintage reproduction chair because the opportunity came up, not because I lust after copies of designer furniture.  If that were the case, my house would be filled with furniture from Thrive or France and Son instead of all of the vintage items I've patiently gathered over the years."

This blogger claims that the Kardiel chairs are identical to those made in China and sold by lexmod, amazon, etc.: http://www.eameschairreplica.com/uncategorized/eames-comparison-kardiel/  My suspicion is that all of the current eames replicas are made by the same factories in China, and that there's little if any difference between them. They're probably fine chairs, but I'd recommend ordering one from ebay or aliexpress for the cheapest price. Assume that all leather and materials are sourced from China. Many claim that the leather is Italian or European, but just like ""real Italian olive oil"", that's all BS.  And of course, if you order one, please post a review when you get it!"

Kirjoitettuaan ylioppilaaksi Mentula kÃ¤vi Ateneumin iltakoulun yleistÃ¤ osastoa. HÃ¤n jatkoi opintojaan ja valmistui sisustusarkkitehdiksi Taideteollisesta oppilaitoksesta 1960. Mentula tyÃ¶skenteli jo opiskellessaan ja valmistuttuaan muiden muassa Antti Nurmesniemen, Timo Sarpanevan ja Toivo Korhosen toimistoissa.  Mentula jatkoi sisustusarkkitehtina omassa studiossaan. HÃ¤n osallistui sisustusarkkitehtuurin lisÃ¤ksi huonekalusuunnitteluun, nÃ¤yttelysuunnitteluun, teolliseen muotoiluun, graafiseen suunnitteluun sekÃ¤ muotoilun konsultointiin.  HÃ¤n oli pidetty ja vÃ¤rikÃ¤s luennoitsija taide-alan oppilaitoksissa Suomessa ja ulkomailla. Erityisesti Italiaan Mentula solmi pysyviÃ¤ suhteita. HÃ¤nen kauttaan Suomeen saatiin vierailuille monia suunnittelijoita.  Mentulan suunnittelemista huonekaluista voi mainita Varjosen puunjalostustehtaan valmistamat ilmavat sorvatut pinnakalusteet sekÃ¤ monet puistonpenkit. Mentulan tyÃ¶skentelyssÃ¤ nÃ¤kyi uteliaisuus uusiin materiaaleihin ja innovatiivisuus. Mentula kuului 1970-luvulla Tampellan keskeisiin painokangassuunnittelijoihin.  Aktiivisen suunnittelijakautensa jÃ¤lkeen Mentula vetÃ¤ytyi julkisuudesta. Villi luonto muodostui hÃ¤nelle tÃ¤rkeimmÃ¤ksi inspiraation lÃ¤hteeksi. Silti aivan viime hetkiin asti saatoimme tavata hÃ¤net yllÃ¤ttÃ¤en kuuntelijana seminaaritapahtumissa ja tunnistaa hÃ¤nen vuosien saatossa tutuksi tulleen hersyvÃ¤n naurunsa.

Mid_Century,2vt926,Toppo,3,Sun Feb 15 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"It's his obituary with mainly the same information as in Finnish Wikipedia, with addition to this:  He was a liked and colorful lecturer in art schools in Finland and abroad. He made permanent ties especially to Italy. Through him several designers came to visit Finland.  Of his designs worth noting are light lathed spoke chairs for Varjonen woodworks factory and several park benches. Mentula's work showed curiosity towards new materials and innovativity. In the 70's he was one of the most important print textile designers for Tampella.  After his active designer period he retracted from public eye. Wild nature came to be his most important source of inspiration. Still until last moments we would see him surprisingly attending seminars and recognize his trickling laughter, which came to be familiar over the years.    Finnish art & design auctioneer Hagelstam sold the orange dining set linked above for ~$910 so I guess you paid a good price with $300 for four chairs."

Mid_Century,2vt926,tallread1,2,Mon Feb 16 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"I've seen the general trend that Finnish mid century stuff is more expensive in the US than in here so yea, they would be more expensive there.  I do have a feeling that these maybe aren't designed for ""PMD-Design"", as I've never heard of a company like that and Googling does not come up with anything. Rather I'd guess that ""PMD"" is an acronym for ""Perttu Mentula Design"" and he might have manufactured those without any company in between. Also it's possible that he designed them for Finnish company HT-Collection. HT Collection does say in their biography ""In the beginning of 60's the production grew larger and the company moved to new facilities in Kukkila, Lahti. Ensio Karjalainen cooperated with the top designers of the time. Furniture designed by Rolf Nyman and Perttu Mentula were exported to USA, Canada, Sweden, Japan and Middle-East. HT-Collection was the pioneer on Finnish furniture production and design in international scale"".   That is a bit bragging, as HT-Collection wasn't a pioneer on Finnish furniture production and design in international scale."
Mid_Century,2vt926,Toppo,3,Mon Feb 16 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yes I am in the same boat, and was thinking the same thing about the PMD acronym.

I might keep my eye out for some that Tampela fabric he made too."

Mid_Century,2vsw3e,Emplox,3,Fri Feb 13 20:30:33 2015 UTC,It's a replica. Possibly made by Plycraft or Selig though I would lean more towards Plycraft as I don't think Selig ever used the wood upper supports.

Although it's possible you could find a supplier that already had a large supply that may be willing to pack it up and ship it.

Mid_Century,2vkloy,deepdorp,-3,Thu Feb 12 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"My short answer: No  Longer answer: Based on what I often read and see on this sub (and online in general), most people do not distinguish between mid-century and MCM, which in my opinion are different.  These are, without a doubt in my mind, mid-century tables, but not modern(MCM) design.  I don't mean this in an elitist way, or to say that MCM is better or worse than MCC (a term I am coining for this post - 'Mid-Century Contemporary'.)  A bad analogy follows:  All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares (where square=modern and rectangle=mid-century.) Does anyone else feel the same way about this as I?  I would love to hear opinions and discussion."
Mid_Century,2vkloy,callmesnake13,19,Thu Feb 12 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"Where on earth are you arriving at this decision? Their design style is modernist of the mid-20th century, that's all it is. They're poor quality, but that's irrelevant. Otherwise they are very distinctively mid-century modern."
Mid_Century,2vkloy,deepdorp,-2,Thu Feb 12 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"First off, I am not and do not claim to be an expert on the topic. But I ask this:  What was conceptual about these tables when they were designed?  What envelope was the designer pushing?, or what artistic statement about form and function was being explored?  I feel like these qualities start to define MCM, and to me they are lacking in the case of these tables.  It's more than just a time period.  I agree with you that they are distinctively mid-century, but just not the modern aspect."
Mid_Century,2vkloy,callmesnake13,7,Thu Feb 12 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"You're talking in terms of feelings when these lines are plainly modernist, and are just a cheap knockoff of any number of Danish end tables. If we need to be more specific, it's ultimately the lack of ornamentation and emphasis on materiality (in the designs they are aping, not these)."
Mid_Century,2vkloy,mullacc,2,Thu Feb 12 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"But what specific qualities are you talking about that making something modern? These tables seem to have all the ""parts"" that a genuine MCM design would have (and also omit the parts that an MCM design would not have). It seems like you are arguing that a collection of the right parts doesn't necessarily make for a modern design. Or are you arguing that the ""parts"" are wrong?"

I agree with this but not in the case of these tables.   The legs are McCobb-esque. The (faux) wood grain is prominently displayed. The lines are clean.   The ""collecting guide"" featured on the sidebar shits on two-tier tables and the mainstream American makers of the time, but the author seems to accept that it is MCM design albeit poorly executed."
Mid_Century,2vkloy,mullacc,2,Thu Feb 12 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks, I had read the sidebar but not the collecting guide that you mentioned. Seems pretty obvious to me after reading that tiered side tables are bottom end (and then Moreso with the laminate).   I think as someone warming up to the MCM genre you just spot stuff and say hey! That's got an MCM look! And just acquire things instead of pieces. That's kind of the state Im at right now, I guess. As I learn more and what's more appreciable I'm sure it will change."

The end result is that the chrome looks shiny again, but please remember to wash off any remaining vinegar with water and then dry very well, or it will rust even worse. This also doesn't work with deep rust or deep pitting, although it will help to some extent. You can then get a chrome protectant from an auto parts shop.

Just got a Lawrence Peabody Selig Wingback fiberglass chair for $15 but the base was gone.   I've sourced the parts and will be making a replica eames dowel/eiffel base. My estimate right now is about $30 in parts. If you're handy, I can shoot you my plans."
Mid_Century,2us94j,wickedpissa,2,Wed Feb 4 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in those plans since I have the same chair as you.  Are you putting any kind of back brace on it,  all the originals seem to have it"
Mid_Century,2us94j,edgestander,2,Wed Feb 4 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see your plans, and how you plan to go about it.  Handy? Not so much... that's what friends are for!"

Epoxy Glue eyelets to end of 10"" rods. Attach rods in x pattern across legs at drilled holes and fasten with nuts and bolts. Bolt U brackets to threaded rods at the top of legs. Create scustom shockmounts with Apoxy sculpt. Coordinate mount locations with constructed leg base and weight/balancing of the chair. Embed nut in Apoxy mounts. Epoxy mounts to chair. Attach legs to chair.  That's basically it, takes some coordination for the getting the mounts correct, but seems fairly doable and at about 50% of the cost of one of the crappy knockoffs. I'll need to do some digging at home depot to come up with all the nuts, bolts, and brackets, but those are all pretty standard parts."
Mid_Century,2us94j,Woolio,3,Thu Feb 5 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"You could probably cut the nubs off with a hacksaw, sand them down to the chair, and epoxy the Eames shock mounts in a standard mount configuration before bolting your base on. It'd be a lot of work, but if you want to do it you could."
Mid_Century,2us94j,TypoKnig,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:00:18 2015 UTC,The rubber mounts on Eames chairs are glued with a very heavy duty industrial heat set glue. You aren't going to find a consumer glue that will hold for very long with use.
Mid_Century,2us94j,vincent_vancough,4,Thu Feb 5 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Not true, people use epoxy to replace shock mounts all the time.  That said, making everything is symmetrical is another story."
Mid_Century,2us94j,TypoKnig,3,Thu Feb 5 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"True. But the chances of it sticking after a couple months of use are slim in my experience of working with Eames chairs for twenty five years or so as a dealer. I tried everything on the market as well as some specialized 3M epoxies which are specific to auto repair and not commercially available. A big part of the problem is that the rubber does not bond well combined with the twisting stress that comes with use. A Herman Miller rep told me they don't use epoxy in manufacturing, they use an industrial glue that requires a machine that applies heat and pressure to make the bond. Epoxy will stick for a while but it's not going to hold up to use in the long run."
Mid_Century,2us94j,vincent_vancough,2,Thu Feb 5 01:26:35 2015 UTC,Are you sure they used to use the same glue treatment on the older fiberglass chairs as well?  Have you ever experimented with clamps and varying surface smoothing when you were using epoxy?  You're the first person to tell me that epoxy has been a less than suitable adhesive to repair shock mounts.
Mid_Century,2us94j,Woolio,3,Thu Feb 5 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the same thing, man. Either this guy's found something that none of the major refurbishing companies have noticed, or he's doing something wrong. I've read testimonials of plenty of people, here included, that have never had any issues with their refurbishing job.   Do you think he knows he needs to sand the gel coat off the fiberglass and rough up the back of the shock mounts before he applies the epoxy? Because the biggest issue I could think of with that application process would be some intermediary material preventing the epoxy from bonding to the chair."
Mid_Century,2us94j,Woolio,2,Thu Feb 5 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you haven't seen Modern Conscience's line of two-part epoxies. It's the stuff they recommend over at Chairfag and Plastolux, and I haven't heard anything about it giving out. Those blogs are the de-facto standard for Eames shell restoration, so I'd like to think they know a thing or two about their products. It's also what Modern Conscience actually uses on their refurbs, and again, never found any complaints.  Granted, it's similar to the epoxy Herman Miller used to use before they switched to the heat-set in the later years of fiberglass production (sometime around the 80s, if memory serves. My chairs from 1956 use epoxy, as noted by the way it has cracked and separated from the fiberglass in ways the modern heat-glue method does not. More modern shells, including some of the newest run of fiberglass, have the cast shock mounts from later-series chairs), so that should give you an indication of how long it can be expected to last if applied properly and left to cure as instructed.   To clarify, you are sanding the areas you're applying the shock mounts to before you apply them, right? Because the gel coat can definitely interfere with a good, strong seal. I've seen that happen, where the entire assemblage will just slide off after it cures. Rubber to fiberglass via epoxy is definitely not uncommon, especially in cars and boats, so I'd be surprised if it were not as effective in furniture."

If its in bad shape, 100-150 max (which most sellers will scoff at since its ""super-duper rare retro stuff"") but you should really just consider spending it on a better shaped knock-off if you can. My garage full of projects makes me give this warning to folks...."
Mid_Century,2upa7t,DFWPhotoguy,3,Wed Feb 4 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wasn't planning on paying more than $100 for it.  I have access to a woodshop and enjoy woodworking, also I don't have any projects right now but I understand your warning about having a garage full of them haha.  I haven't seen it in person yet so I'm not sure on the condition.  Looks like the shell is veneer and I'm not sure how much I could do with it. Also would  reupholster it cheap in black like this post. http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2floa1/reupholstered_refurbished_and_rebuilt_a_70s_era/  Seller says it's a 1960s plycraft if that makes a difference."
Mid_Century,2upa7t,riomx,5,Wed Feb 4 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"It's not a 1960s Plycraft. It's a later 70s Selig chair.  I restored a Plydesigns chair in 2013 and 2014. They are very similar to later Selig chairs, except for they have 4-star bases on the chair and ottoman.   Both Selig and Plydesigns are often mistaken for Plycraft chairs, because to anyone who doesn't know about Eames Lounge reproductions, everything is a Plycraft chair. However, Plycraft chairs have their own quirks and builds that are different from Selig and Plydesigns. The latter were more blatant in regard to getting closer to the shape and appearance of authentic chairs.  The veneer is thin but durable, so don't fear stripping or sanding, but be extremely careful not to overdo it. Also, consider finishing with oil instead of stain. I would recommend Deft Danish Oil, and they come in different hues. Also, don't use gloss to seal -- I've seen plenty of examples of people doing this and it always looks like ass.

I think as long as you personally find them attractive, and think the price is right, you should go for them. It's just something you are gonna have to think about and be really honest with yourself over.   I will say this though. Gunlocke chairs are not all that hard to find. There are 3 separate listings on my local Craigslist right now for the exact same chair. It is almost impossible for me to find MCM furniture in my local area, and yet there are still a ton of these chairs available.

Mid_Century,2u9i5a,awd3495,3,Sat Jan 31 05:31:01 2015 UTC,I'm afraid the cost will be high!   The light was in a room with red shag carpet a black brick fireplace and wood paneling.  The house was built in 1967 and the light was probably a built in feature.  I would like to eventually (hopefully a long time from now) put it back in the house after they have passed and I have the house.
Mid_Century,2u9i5a,riomx,2,Sat Jan 31 06:57:07 2015 UTC,"So you basically already made a decision before you asked your question. Be upfront and say ""I'm going to split these up because two are broken."""

Mid_Century,2u2qcy,Toppo,7,Thu Jan 29 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"There's this Facebook group in my city where people spot and report dumpsters with potentially valuable & usable stuff. Often these are temporary street dumpsters during renovations, moves and so on. Someone posted that these kind of chairs were at a dumpster so in 3 minutes I was out of my home heading there, and managed to get four of these chairs to myself.  These are exactly the kind of chairs I've been looking for and for the past weeks I've been checking different sales sites if I could find some. Earlier I posted about how I found a mid-century dining table from a dumpster, and these chairs are simply perfect for that table I now have.  I'm 90% sure these are model called ""Tuoli 50"", literally ""Chair 50"", designed by Kurt HvitsjÃ¶ in 1955 for Finnish furniture company Isku. They mainly came in birch color and you can see the Tuoli 50 in dinner setting in here. Now the chairs I have are somewhat different. The back of the chair is higher and curved, whereas in the standard Tuoli 50 the back is lower and the profile is straight.  My friend who has worked as a designer for Isku said that the veneer seems to be some tropical hardwood veneer which would imply these are variations of Tuoli 50 meant to be ""more luxorious"" & for home use, instead of offices and schools, but might also mean these are Swedish or Danish or from somewhere else Europe, as in the 50's they didn't really care about copyrights and everyone just copied each other.  These kind of chairs are most commonly known as ""school chairs"" in Finland, as they were the standard for school chairs here decades ago. After that these kind of models have become increasingly sought after and in the Facebook group people were really eager to get these. Isku recently started producing modernized versions of these kind of chairs, which I find quite odd, as majority of the people want the old chairs with wooden surfaces. The old models are often in interior design blogs, articles and sold quite quickly.  The chairs I have are generally in average to poor condition and need some repairing. These are in theory stackable, but the stacking has over the decades caused the wooden parts to wear out on the edges. Some of the chairs have the veneer chipped of, and one has golden paint stains. Next I'll head to r/woodworking to ask some tips.  Other product from Isku I'd like to note is this ergononic chair designed to accomodate male genitalia."
Mid_Century,2u2qcy,toddmp,3,Thu Jan 29 12:44:45 2015 UTC,great find. good call going to r/woodworking. I am guessing the recommendation will be to fill the cracks and holes with wood putty then buy some new veneer and apply. they will be brand new again.
Mid_Century,2u2qcy,Moominsean,2,Thu Jan 29 16:07:42 2015 UTC,I already got excellent tips from there! Will post results when I'm finished renovating these.
Mid_Century,2tyy6h,Woolio,3,Wed Jan 28 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they've already ruined the buildings with previous renovations and a lack of maintenance.   What the place needs is a large-scale restoration to the original design specs. I doubt that'll happen, though."
Mid_Century,2tyy6h,3wayhandshake,2,Wed Jan 28 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"Unless county legislators act quickly, a paragon of midcentury American idealism will be lost.  Paul Rudolphâs Orange County Government Center, in Goshen, N.Y., announces itself as a civic hub. Itâs made of corrugated concrete and glass, organized into three pavilions around a courtyard, like an old wagon train around a village green.  A county proposal would tear down huge chunks of it, flatten the roof, destroy windows, swap out parts of the textured concrete facade and build what looks like an especially soul-crushing glass box. Goshen would end up with a Frankensteinâs monster, eviscerating a work that the World Monuments Fund, alarmed by precisely this turn of events, included on its global watch list alongside landmarks like Machu Picchu and the Great Wall of China."

Mid_Century,2tukzl,FrankenFresh,15,Tue Jan 27 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"This project started a little over a year ago. I was working at a thrift store, and we got in a gorgeous mid-century hutch. I had never really seen mid-century design up until then, and as a designer, it made so much sense to me and practically changed everything I knew.  I set out to garage sales with $20 in my pocket, and I began buying and selling with that bill until I had amassed a hefty collection.  Once my shitty trailer had become too small, I moved to a mid century apartment that had remained fairly untouched for the past five decades. The landlord said he'd tear out and replace ""that old shit"" if it didn't work, and I told him never to touch anything. I restored and rewired most of the place for several months.

That makes sense to me, but If I was buying it new, I would want something different then the ones I see all the time. A lot of my friends have walnut versions in their home and they are super nice, but it is just another Eames lounge chair to me at this point. I did not know that the leather was any different though. That is good to know."
Mid_Century,2tu05v,F-That,3,Wed Jan 28 16:01:40 2015 UTC,Yeah they switched to a more commercial grade leather in the 80's to increase chair longevity. But recently they brought back the more natural option for like 230 dollars more

I'm not sure if prices or 'estimates' are allowed on this sub, after looking at the sidebar I didn't see anything. With that said, do you have a site or guide to valuing these pieces? I know I could use Ebay and a few other sources but most of those pieces are in mint or near-mint condition so it's hard for me to come to a valuation on a piece like this which is banged up but potentially older and still has the tags.  One last thing to clarify because I'm not sure if it's easily visible from the pics: My chair seems way shorter than all the other examples I've seen. It is only 5-6 inches off the ground?

Usually the worst that would happen is you get a cranky homeowner yelling at you to get off their front porch.   I don't know where in New England you are hoping to look, but a really fun place to browse around in is Rocket to Mars in Providence. They don't have very much if any stuff that would be considered MCM, mostly 50's kitsch, and it is rather small, but it is still one of the most fun stores I've ever been to in New England.   I found a whole lot of MCM stuff at the Rhode Island Antiques Mall when I was last in the area about 2 years ago. They have a huge downstairs space and that was where the majority was located back then.   Those are basically the only places in New England I have had the chance to check out that were memorable.

Mid_Century,2tn65b,licoricestic,2,Thu Jan 29 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"Ok so here is my two cents. I am by no means a professional at any of this, but I have remodeled much of my house and helped/watched my dad completely overhaul his 3500 square foot mid century modern home. I can put some pics up in a few minutes.    I would try to gently pry out all the molding including that ""monstrosity on the door"".  I know a guy that will give me a fair price on stuff like that, because there are people with older houses and tastes that will want and appreciate it. You can find someone (craigslist, antique shops, etc.) I got $150 for similar oak trim (if it is pine you can throw it out, other hardwoods are  worth more).    I would leave the fireplace mantel. Is it marble or just dirty? I would also just demo that case around what I assume is a radiator or electric heater.  You could easily build a simple case with seating on top (though you might not want to use upholstery if it gets too hot.  A layer of foam board insulation in-between the upholstery and base might do the trick. I think I would make that area a separate reading nook with heater right there I bet it would be cozy as hell with a stylish love seat facing towards the window and a couple of lounge chairs to the side, maybe a ball hanging light.    I would probably put a cool MCM desk in front of that inset part by the fire place, you could easily devise a way to hide all of the cables for a computer all peripherals and TV over the fireplace.  In this day in age it is highly advantageous to have your computer near your TV. I would put a cool sectional making an L leaving about 5-8 feet from where the wall comes out I would want the L section near my computer, you may want it to back up to the loveseat facing the other direction, though I think the windows should always be featured in MCM. A few more lounge chairs a coffee table and an end table, boom done.   I play a lot of games so I would look to put a 4-6 person tulip style table in the corner of the room immediately right of the door when you are walking in even if you have a eat in kitchen or dining room.   I would probably move, replace, and add to the overhead lighting, but I don't think you can beat the flat LED's they sell at HD or Lowes for $30 or so. Maybe some hanging lights over the game/dining area.   I have no idea what that fold out thing by the door is? Table? I would put some coat hooks and a bench there.   Just some I ideas.  Not counting furniture, the actual work involved in this would be minimal.  Materials would only be probably $500 a lot less if you just use furring strips and paint or stain them yourself.  if you do flat moulding for the whole room all you need is a table saw, a tape measure, a hammer and nails.  Another $150 or so to re-build the heater area for this you will probably need a level.  So $650 not counting furniture/tv/computer.   Edit: Some of the many spelling and grammatical errors."

Mid_Century,2tc0y3,Ekalsrek,2,Thu Jan 22 22:32:39 2015 UTC,Never sat in the real deal so it's hard to say! feels solid to me.

Mid_Century,2tc0y3,Hasselbuddy,3,Thu Jan 22 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for a replica myself. This one looks great and I would happily buy the same one if this site shipped to the US. There are tons available here, but you never know about the quality. Anyone happen to know of a good, similarly priced replica available for Americans?"
Mid_Century,2tc0y3,thespt,6,Fri Jan 23 13:14:13 2015 UTC,In all honesty it doesn't seem to be a very good replica. The cushions are far too cushy and the base is completely wrong.   I've heard good things about IFN replicas.
Mid_Century,2tc0y3,The_Dig,3,Fri Jan 23 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, those do look nice. A bit more money, but still much less than an original and worth it not to take a crap shoot with something from China."
Mid_Century,2tc0y3,hazertag,3,Fri Jan 23 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"OP said in another thread they paid 650GBP for it ($975), so yeah a little pricier but the quality is far better and the design is much closer to the original."

Mid_Century,2tasmp,rodface,2,Thu Jan 22 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"Nice, although I wonder if someone has stripped some of the finish off, the lighter wood and the legs usually aren't that light in my experience."
Mid_Century,2tasmp,Suppafly,2,Thu Jan 22 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"You are correct, that is what they look like when they are refinished. The veneer on top (the fakeout dovetailing section) is made out of a different wood (walnut) than the rest of the table (oak). The true colors come out when you strip it."
Mid_Century,2tasmp,tallread1,2,Thu Jan 22 20:24:58 2015 UTC,Oh man that's just a veneer? Shucks...
Mid_Century,2tasmp,kevan,4,Fri Jan 23 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"Furniture that is veneer actually ages much better and theoretically is stronger. (But furniture usually doesn't get the amount of stress where that would make a difference.) Also, with a veneer the chances are higher that the maker could choose higher quality grain and also would have flexibility in making different sections match.  Basically, if you can't tell it's veneer by sight, veneer furniture is usually better to own."
Mid_Century,2tasmp,tallread1,3,Fri Jan 23 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the explanation."
Mid_Century,2tasmp,CANT_AFFORD_A_DUCATI,1 point,Sat Jan 24 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, otherwise it would be much more difficult to make. The way they built them allowed them to mass produce at a low cost. It's still a very solid line, though."

Mid_Century,2t71mx,lobster_johnson,3,Fri Jan 23 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"The quality â build, materials, visible screws, etc. â seems pretty poor. It's either been reupholstered at some point (badly!), or it's been vandalized, or (more likely) it's just bad from the factory. Looks like vinyl/""pleather"", not real leather? All in all, I don't think this is anything special at all. But they look good for what they are."
Mid_Century,2t71mx,darryljenks,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"It's quite similar to, but not exactly like a Grete Jalk chair or a Erik Kirkegaard chair. The back support looks a bit like Finn Juul's 109 chair. I think they would look great with grey wool fabric."
Mid_Century,2t3wqj,rodface,3,Tue Jan 20 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"Designed by Edward Durell Stone   In 1950, Stone formed a partnership with architect Alfred Aydelott of Memphis, Tennessee to design the Hospital of Social Security for Employees in Lima, Peru. This project established Stone as a specialist in hospital design, and it would lead to a series of commissions that focused on providing a humane environment for patients. Many of Stone's prominent medical commissions were in the State of California and include the Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, the Scripps Institute in La Jolla and the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage."

Mid_Century,2t4nsj,tallread1,2,Sun Mar 22 22:05:38 2015 UTC,1  2  3  4
Mid_Century,2t4nsj,edgestander,5,Wed Jan 21 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about the original Kagan desk, but yours does not match up with any of the pictures you showed. It doesn't look like the original desk has that cross support that yours does. Also, if you look closely at the sides, the edge of the lucite is squared off on the original. Yours follows the shape of the roll top.   Clearly these are not the same desk, but I don't know enough about it to tell you whether that means you have a knockoff or a later design of the real thing. If I had to guess though, I would say repro simply because of the cross post. Most well-made furniture would not add something like that if it was not already necessary because it would make sitting at that desk a little bit more uncomfortable.   Take all of this with a grain of salt. These are just my deductions."

Used some 1 to 1 ratio OMS and Dark Walnut stain and cloth-rubbed it into place in areas where the wood had scratches/dents through the both the finish and stain. Buffed that lightly with 00 steel wool, then applied Restor-a-finish in a few areas in top of that and buffed with 000 steel wool to match the existing finish's sheen."

Mid_Century,2stw3d,comet3popeye,2,Sun Jan 25 11:28:22 2015 UTC,"I have some finishing experience,  yes,  but I'm currently learning whatever i can about MCM finishes.  There are some weird formulas/application methods out there. In addition the finishes of lesser-quality manufacturers sometimes don't stand up to the tests of time and usage. However the pieces may have 'great lines' and be worth the attention. It can be a head scratcher to determine how to delicately touch-up those finishes without branching into re-finishing"

Always hard to put that much $ into something when you aren't wealthy by any means but we've been happy with the investment.

Mid_Century,2sk655,samuraikiss,4,Thu Jan 15 21:48:19 2015 UTC,I've always appreciated the way that Erik G Warner at Mid Century Vibe does restoration.

I think I finally finished it off by recently picking up the unit to hold my records and my amp/turntable. As far as I'm concerned, it's perfect but I really would like to know from the more knowledgeable types here if anyone recognizes it? Same with the chair. I had to recover it but hey, I only paid $10 for that chair and it's super comfortable when I'm listening to tunes. Any help would be appreciated!"
Mid_Century,2seymr,turf1600,5,Wed Jan 14 16:51:48 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/FIlAPAX.jpg  It needs a bit of love but it's mostly in fantastic shape. The radio and record player work but the dial needs to be restrung and the volume drifts. I'm going to do a standard cleaning and recap for the electronics and try to tidy up the cabinet. In this case I think the volume drift is from dirty contacts on the variable resistor. I think I'm going to wall mount my TV and have this underneath. I may mount my Roku and DVR underneath this or tuck them somewhere inside of the cabinet.
Mid_Century,2seymr,forliberty,2,Wed Jan 14 16:55:09 2015 UTC,Is it tube?

I've got a friend that does that, I'll see if I can find a link to his stuff.   If you decide to use it as a TV cabinet, I'd check the speakers, see if they need to be refoamed, and then wire them into something like a Lepai Tripath amp coming from your TV, or some sort of stereo receiver. I guarantee you they'll sound leagues better than your TV's speakers.   Let us know how it goes, I always love seeing what people do with these things."

Mid_Century,2seymr,forliberty,2,Thu Jan 15 00:58:32 2015 UTC,A plinth is the base of a record player. Record players need to be on something as solid and heavy as possible because they rely on the stylus going up and down.

Mid_Century,2seymr,forliberty,2,Thu Jan 15 02:43:06 2015 UTC,They said to take it out of the console and make it a standalone turntable. Which means putting it into a plinth.
Mid_Century,2seymr,Woolio,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"You can remove most of these kinds of turntables from their housing, which is the cabinet, and stick it in a new custom plinth for various reasons.

It is a Mersman #8172 coffee table according to the maker's mark.  The wood veneer top must have endured years of abuse, given the myriad of stains and rings across its surface. The veneer has been worn away on all the edges, but only chipped in one corner. The legs and drawer are in good condition, although wood is missing from both drawer slides. The table does have a significant wobble which was not resolved by tightening the flat head screws in the base. (Photos coming soon!) I would love to restore or refinish it. What do you recommend?"

Mid_Century,2s67p2,mathis007,6,Mon Jan 12 15:37:33 2015 UTC,Wait for a sale - or buy discounted gift cards. Or save up. If that's the one you fell in love with you probably won't find a replacement that completely fills that hole. Ask me how I know. Also consider selling something else to cover the difference. You're 80% of the way there.  It's a really nice looking desk btw.

Yea my problem is that I think the desk is only worth $400 in my eyes. so selling something to make up the difference would only get me the piece, but i'd feel that I overpaid for it. $100 more is $100 that i'd want to put elsewhere (i just bought a townhouse, and want to go to grad school so i'm used to putting a ""value in my eyes"" price for things). I found this which is super similar and just in a different finish, so i still need to do some looking around to see if there are any other kind of cheaper alternatives"
Mid_Century,2s67p2,aigret,2,Mon Jan 12 16:21:18 2015 UTC,I will tell you that West Elm has sales frequently and you may be able to hunt for coupon codes to get an extra discount. Just a thought.
Mid_Century,2s67p2,Woolio,4,Tue Jan 13 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm known for being a little bit radical about pricing around here... Especially when it comes to Eames lounges. Anyway, I think it's important to consider what you do at your desk, and how long you're there.   It's reasonable to assume that if you'll be working at your desk several hours a day, probably every day, all year, it might be worth investing in a quality desk that you like. It could be argued that if you decide to go cheaper, you're going to notice all the little flaws that make it cheaper, you're not going to like it nearly as much, and it's going to break faster than if you bought something of quality.   If you're going to grad school, you're going to be at that desk a lot more than you think you are. Even if it only holds up for five or ten years, it's $50-100 a year over buying a $100 desk and having it break after a year, or wobble itself apart. Even if it's perfectly structurally sound, they'll often still look cheap, like your $200 replacement, and that will drive you insane.   Actually, that brings me to a point about buying desks that most people don't consider: wobble. Cheap desks will wobble uncontrollably, and you can't fix it. You want to look for something that uses a lot of material, and has a solid box frame for the base. West Elm is usually pretty good about this, but I'm not sure about this particular desk. It looks solid, but it's always a good idea to have a return policy to fall back on.   Hope that helps. I know it's vague, but it's not my job to convince you to buy it. I'm just trying to get you to think about what that money gets you, so you find what's right for you. Good luck."

Mid_Century,2s67p2,trancelogix,7,Wed Jan 14 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"Be careful when buying West Elm furniture.  I buy decor items from them that aren't expensive, but their wood furniture is not of the greatest quality.  Think Ikea, but slightly better.  If you love the desk, get it, but know it won't last decades like a vintage or higher quality piece would."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,lobster_johnson,4,Mon Jan 12 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"Some of West Elm's stuff is actually very solid. I bought the Dumond buffet, and compared to the particleboard crap from IKEA, it's a beast. Solid wood base, metal back; the frame is admittedly engineered wood (probably MDF, it's not specified), but it still felt really well put together. It's just one data point, of course.  A lot of high-end brands are really well made. Lots aren't; Blu Dot comes to mind."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,i_am_lie_bot,2,Tue Jan 13 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"A West Elm recently opened up near me and I went to check it out. I was shocked at how cheap the prices were and asked the girl helping me where the furniture pieces were made. She told me most of the furniture is made in North Carolina. Doing a quick search - including on their own website - when I got home said otherwise. Their site simply said ""Imported"" and we all know what that means."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,callmesnake13,4,Mon Jan 12 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, it's expensive but the quality is far better than Ikea. Ikea is nicely designed garbage."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,lobster_johnson,4,Mon Jan 12 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"A word of warning. You get what you pay for. And I would argue that you don't get a great wooden desk for that price.  While this desk may seem expensive to you, in the world of desks, this is already cheap. Which means the quality is going to be accordingly. And look: While the base (ie., legs) is solid wood, the rest is something cheap with a thin wood veneer glued over it. A real wood product would have cost much more. Oh, and anything you find on Overstock.com is very likely going to be worse.  If you want high quality, I would advise you to search for a real vintage desk that you can spend some time restoring. People make lucky finds all the time.  As for the style, it's reminiscent of a lot of mid-century modern furniture. Paul McCobb's planner group desk comes to mind. The beveled edges on the West Elm desk are rare in MCM furniture, and is probably influenced by some of Greta Grossman's pieces. (She designed desks, but they don't look like that.)"
Mid_Century,2s67p2,riomx,3,Tue Jan 13 01:27:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, but to be fair, many vintage pieces manufactured even by renowned companies like Herman Miller layered veneer over composite or lesser woods.  That being said, I would still get a vintage desk because of the superior craftsmanship before I'd get anything from West Elm.  Here's my veneered walnut desk. It may not be solid wood, but it's very well-made and has served me well for almost 4 years now."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,lobster_johnson,3,Tue Jan 13 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, most MCM desks use veener. There's nothing wrong with a good veneer."
Mid_Century,2s67p2,marygraces,2,Tue Jan 13 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"It is a beautiful desk. Love those legs! l bought a couple dining table from WE over the years (for myself and clients). I was happy with WE quality. Recently WE moved to another state...my table got a bit bashed around in the moving truck. It started to wobble after the move. I took it apart and put it back to gether again. It's as sturdy as ever. No complaints here. If you love it and can afford it, go for it. otherwise keep checking out Craigslist!"

Mid_Century,2s3pzi,tallread1,2,Tue Jan 13 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"That makes it tough. The shapes of the table and chairs are not instantly recognizable.  It seems to me (personally) an interpretation of Danish design that could be American, but I'm not sure.  Do you recognize the type of wood, by any chance? That's another aspect that can help.  Looks a bit like walnut to me with a glossy finish, but it could be the lighting. Danish pieces are usually oiled and lightly sealed (at least the chairs and tables I've owned and sold)."

My dad and I argued over whether or not this set was MCM. I said it wasn't because of the cut of the legs on the second level. Since no one wanted the set and it was either Goodwill or the trash, I sold them as a set on Craigslist for $75 and it took a while to sell them.   I prefer ssphotos version without the second tier."

I don't recall if the bottom level was the same along the border... I think it wasn't, but that the front had a piece of horizontal wood and the rest was vertical. Still pretty!

Mid_Century,2rlcuy,turf1600,3,Wed Jan 7 04:00:05 2015 UTC,I'm moving in a month and have needed to get a new desk for several years now. After looking at all of your awesome photos I hit CL and found this. Now I don't have to bring my junky desk with me. It needs a little TLC but it's all there. It's completely unmarked - so if you have any idea who made it I'd appreciate the info. Now to find a chair to go with it...
Mid_Century,2rlcuy,psrivats,2,Wed Jan 7 04:01:52 2015 UTC,Are you by any chance in pdx? I was looking at a very similar one just yesterday.
Mid_Century,2rlcuy,psrivats,2,Wed Jan 7 21:14:30 2015 UTC,Yep. But I'm moving to Beaverton :(
Mid_Century,2rlcuy,riomx,2,Wed Jan 7 21:17:16 2015 UTC,Why the :( - it's not that far from you. I live in the 'burbs myself just to be closer to work. Rent is good and you can always drive to the city.

The leaves are brass and the tree trunks are copper. It is missing the cluster of leaves where the signature would be found, [far right end of the piece]. I'm not sure if you have a local metal repair shop but I would look into having the piece restored to its former glory. Restored properly it's worth upwards of $1,000 or more. Either way I'm happy you saved it from the dumpster. Enjoy!"
Mid_Century,2rjipo,lwkane,2,Wed Jan 7 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"So where did you get your info on these sculptures.  I picked up a nearly 6 foot long copper work today that is reminiscent of airplane wings that is in fact a perspective of plowed fields with a road and house and some barns at top.  It is a 3 dimensional work and after I got it I saw that it was signed jere.  Guy sold it to me for $15 at a flea market and said he found it in an attic of a house he was clearing out.  It was wrapped up in paper and had been there for some time.   Seller thought it was some sort of ""damn art.""  I just thought it would be a cool garden piece... Now I'm wondering maybe it shouldn't go where I intended."
Mid_Century,2rjipo,123middlenameismarie,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:59:48 2015 UTC,I know a little about the artist and his work. I Googled the artist name and found the name of the artwork. Most metal pieces have a stamped signature somewhere on the artwork. Do you have pictures of your piece?
Mid_Century,2rjipo,lwkane,2,Sat Apr 25 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"Not great, i've not cleaned the bird poop off nor hung it yet.  Just set it out in the sun and snagged these snaps.  It is probably over 6' as it wouldn't fit in a truck bed straight, we had to put it in on a diagonal.  Has 3 hangers on the back.  If nothing else I'm sure scrap value is more than $15 if I end up deciding I hate it.   http://imgur.com/Sv5ugn8 http://imgur.com/DeLZ5c5 http://imgur.com/a/ZOaZr"
Mid_Century,2rjipo,123middlenameismarie,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:18:39 2015 UTC,Wow! That's a huge piece and looks legit. I think you scored a very unique piece of his work that I've never seen before. C. Jere is known mainly for his more abstract metal pieces of things in nature. He did some landscapes and that's what you have. I would track down someone locally to have it looked at and appraised before cleaning it. I didn't see any bird poop in the photos and would hate to decrease the value of the piece by cleaning off something that was meant to be on it. If you have local art museum or decorative metal shop I would contact them about cleaning and restoring it. Awesome buy! Congratulations!
Mid_Century,2rjipo,lwkane,2,Sun Apr 26 00:05:11 2015 UTC,Well I had a nice spot on garden wall picked out...  Guess I should hold off just in case.  If it is a knock off then I'm set in that regard new garden art! I just liked the lines and the sheer mass of the thing.
Mid_Century,2rjipo,123middlenameismarie,8,Sun Apr 26 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"I was walking home last night, and a leaf cluster from this thing caught my eye next to a dumpster. In the dark, I could hardly see a thing. My first thought was ""that's a mid-century brass wall hanging!""  My second thought was I was being stupid and it was an actual plant. But my mid-century intuition proved correct. I grabbed it and hustled home.  After a bit of research, it appears to be ""Elms"" or ""The Elms"" or perhaps ""Forest"" by C. JerÃ©.  There's a small ""C. JerÃ©"" nameplate on the back. Other Elms I've found online are additionally signed and dated on the back of one of the leafs.  Unfortunately I can't find this signed and dated leaf on mine. Maybe it was on one of the missing clusters, of which there are a few. I checked the dumpster for any stragglers this morning, but no luck. I wish I had a date!  I'm also unsure if the bend is intentional. I've seen a few bent ones online, but most seem to have a straight horizon. I kind of like the bend, myself.  This is going to look great in my hallway, as shown in the pictures. Just need to figure out a way to hang it. Seems like one to keep rather than flip ($500+ ?), if only for the dumpster story."

Mid_Century,2rhkt5,xTomBx,2,Tue Jan 6 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that narrow of a period - I've seen FM sets from the late 40's (Zenith had a few dual band ones) and tube sets into the 60's - I had a Panasonic that had AM/FM and FM with AFC, which gave it the ability to lock onto stations almost as good as a modern set.  The older tube FM sets are pretty rare, though.  Typically only seen in bigger consoles (I have a nice '57 Maggie that's am/fm, but mono)"

Mid_Century,2rgy3k,wifeski,5,Tue Jan 6 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"That's old polyurethane that's been exposed to weather and sunlight, and broken down over time. If you're afraid about sanding through the veneer, look at using a chemical polyurethane stripper and then giving it a light sanding before applying any new sealant.   I'd go with Danish Oil, myself. It dries harder and less shiny than poly, which makes it great for pieces like this which don't need to shine like the light of a thousand suns. It's pretty simple to apply, just brush it on and then wipe off any excess with a lint-free rag, and wait for it to dry. Do that three or four times, and it should be good to go."
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,3,Tue Jan 6 03:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's very very very likely that it is a lacquer finish and not a poly as that's what Lane used to finish their pieces in the factory. Best bet it to soak a tshirt in lacquer thinner, drape it over the table and let it sit on it for 3 minutes. The finish will more than likely just wipe right off. Repeat that a couple times and go with the Danish Oil treatment."
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,uselessknowledge,3,Tue Jan 6 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"This may not be the original finish, as I've read that this particular table could have originally been two-toned, which mine no longer is.  Would I do any harm to the veneer if I tested a small area with each product (PU stripper vs lacquer thinner) to see which one works? Or is there a product that will remove both?"
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,uselessknowledge,3,Tue Jan 6 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"A stripper like citristrip, soygel, or Strip-X (ordered from weakest to strongest) will strip multiple types of finishes. Poly needs a stronger stripper, if that's what it is, lacquer will come off with weaker one. You won't hurt anything by doing test patches as eventually your goal is to remove all the finish by any means possible."
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,2,Tue Jan 6 05:50:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I read some product reviews and it looks like Soy-Gel is the best one for me. I'll finish it with Danish Oil.
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,2,Tue Jan 6 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't consider that. I had just assumed it had been refinished sometime in the past, since it didn't really look like what these normally look like. I think they were two-toned or something, but I can't really remember.   Anyway, this is probably good advice. Try this first.   EDIT: Yes, they were two-toned, apparently. So this probably has been refinished. Does lacquer normally go sticky?"
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,uselessknowledge,2,Tue Jan 6 21:55:15 2015 UTC,Do I sand between Danish Oil applications? Should I apply anything on top of the Danish Oil when I'm done?
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,6,Tue Jan 6 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, Danish Oil doesn't work the same way polyurethane does. It soaks into the wood and polymerizes there, instead of just creating a polymerized surface, effectively plasticizing the wood itself. You can just let it soak into the wood, wipe away what's left on top, and then immediately apply another coat.   Anyway, here's a guide. You're going to love this stuff."
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,2,Tue Jan 6 21:45:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the guide! Very helpful
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,Woolio,5,Wed Jan 7 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Update: I picked up some soy-gel and got started today. Pics of the process here.  So far I've just stripped the tabletop, and the Soy-Gel worked like a charm. Worked quickly and the old finish came off easily.  A few lingering questions for you MCM-restoring ninjas:  I wiped the old finish and soy-gel off with a paper towel, and tried to clean it up as best I could with water. Every time I hit it with a fresh paper towel, more finish comes off with it. Should I do another round of Soy-Gel, or just let it dry before lightly sanding it? I read somewhere that I could use mineral spirits to clean it, but wasn't sure if that's ok to use with Soy-Gel.  How do I dispose of the Soy-Gel soaked towels? I know things can spontaneously combust, and the jug doesn't have any warnings on it. A quick google search didn't yield any answers so I am guessing it's safe to toss in the trash?  Thanks to everyone who has helped so far!"
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,tallread1,2,Wed Jan 7 00:21:40 2015 UTC,I haven't used soygel so maybe /u/Woolio can chime in but typically Odorless Mineral Spirits will aid in cleaning stripper and the old finish off more quickly than say water. Water will also raise grain and require sanding if used too much. Soygel towels can just be tossed.
Mid_Century,2rgy3k,tallread1,2,Wed Jan 7 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"Just keep doing what you're doing until no more finish comes off, then give it a very light sanding by hand with high-grit sandpaper to knock off the last of it and knock down any grain. After that, let it dry out and start applying the Danish Oil.   It's coming along really well. Looks like a brand new table already."
Mid_Century,2rerx3,samuraikiss,8,Mon Jan 5 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"Here's what you should be asking yourself: Do I like this? Would I be willing to have this piece in my home? Can I afford to fix it?

Mid_Century,2reo22,F-That,6,Mon Jan 5 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Ah man, I'd kill for some of these. The upholstered shells in good condition are some of my favorites. I can't say I've ever seen a narrow-mount stacking base, but I'm interested to see what you can figure out.   Oh, uh, a word of advice though. Those covers are glued down, and it'll be a lot of sanding and refinishing work if you remove them. These also seem to be one of the chairs without the shock mounts, so those bolts are drilled through the seat. That said, Oxy-Clean should be able to get most of the stains out if you want to leave the covers on. You could also try re-dyeing them if you want, some people have had good success with that."
Mid_Century,2reo22,Woolio,4,Mon Jan 5 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That dyeing looks to be a pain in the ass but maybe I will do it to a couple of them. I have 8 total.   You say because they don't have the shock mounts, the hardware is clear through the chair? That sucks. I'm not going to take off the material if it is going to show the holes.

Mid_Century,2reo22,Woolio,4,Mon Jan 5 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the upholstered shells are a pain sometimes. After the 1957 DAX-1, which was made from shells that didn't pass inspection and fitted with a removable cover, they switched to custom shells with the threaded sockets inserted directly into the base and the upholstery glued on.   All my upholstered shells are the 1957 model, so I've had a lot of luck just stripping the upholstery and giving them a good wash. I'm sitting in one now, even, and it's probably one of the best desk chairs I've owned. I'll probably need to give mine a good sanding and resealing soon, though, since these shells have been scratched to high heaven since 1957."

Mid_Century,2reo22,Cosmonaut_Kramer,2,Mon Jan 5 19:01:22 2015 UTC,Pics would be cool. Thanks.
Mid_Century,2reo22,Woolio,3,Mon Jan 5 19:24:44 2015 UTC,This is the chair without foam or upholstery.  This is the rear of the chair showing the narrow mounts.  And this is the manufacture date. I'm pretty sure it reads August 4th 1971.
Mid_Century,2reo22,Woolio,2,Mon Jan 5 22:43:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this. I'm going to just clean mine up and leave the upholstery on. its pretty good on most of them.
Mid_Century,2r9f48,quibusquibus,16,Sun Jan 4 02:15:05 2015 UTC,These are made by Dorothy Thorpe. They are very popular because it has been featured on the show Mad Men.
Mid_Century,2r9f48,DancingOnACounter,3,Sun Jan 4 02:42:17 2015 UTC,I thought it looked like Don Draper's hand should've been wrapped around it!
Mid_Century,2r9f48,MsModernity,5,Sun Jan 4 06:57:29 2015 UTC,Definitely fell for these after seeing them on Mad Men!
Mid_Century,2r9f48,Woolio,4,Mon Jan 5 15:36:06 2015 UTC,I'll have to keep this in mind. I pass by a lot of tarnished silver when I go antique shopping because I've always worried it's going to be too much work to fix. Guess I'll take a closer look at that sort of thing now.
Mid_Century,2r9f48,miltonsalwaysright,3,Sun Jan 4 02:34:10 2015 UTC,glasses are fantastic. Tullamore dew though?

Mid_Century,2r9f48,MercuryChild,2,Sun Jan 4 05:09:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think it was Crest. Anything will do. I also tried some corn starch to get them a little more lustrous - didn't help, but it removed tarnish as well."
Mid_Century,2r9f48,sw918,2,Sun Jan 4 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"If you had searched eBay for Dorothy Thorpe, you would've found many. We've been collecting all kinds of her glasses over the last 3-5 years after we found some plates at a thrift store."
Mid_Century,2r9s0t,dildosmith,3,Sun Jan 4 04:24:17 2015 UTC,"I know this table isn't a collectible, and isn't up to the usual caliber of MCM furniture examples in this sub.  It is, for me, a table that I like and would like to repair and possibly refinish. It'll do for the den, while we look for longer term furniture. I'm going to refinish the legs, and clean and polish The brass. The top is, I think, Formica. So, how do I determine if that material is Formica? And has anyone here painted Formica? Thank you."
Mid_Century,2r9s0t,weenur,5,Sun Jan 4 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"So, you're right - it's not valuable or collectible.  If you want to paint it, that's cool.  I painted a cheap formica coffee table by sanding the surface, priming and painting.  Let all the coats dry completely."
Mid_Century,2r9s0t,Woolio,2,Sun Jan 4 19:34:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for getting back to me.  I appreciate the advice.   I like the table's lines and the starburst drawer pull. It's the perfect size for the space.
Mid_Century,2r9s0t,Woolio,3,Mon Jan 5 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"If it's plastic, it's Formica.   That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. You can do a lot of neat stuff with it. If you want to paint it, just give it a good sanding to take off the shine, roll on some thinned-out paint, and then rub on some poly. Shouldn't take more than a weekend at most."
Mid_Century,2r6srr,McDamnright,3,Sat Jan 3 08:10:24 2015 UTC,Wonderful! Love how your t.v. illustrates your dedication to authenticity (we just hide our flat screen in the bedroom). Does it work well?
Mid_Century,2r6srr,thebeesremain,3,Sat Jan 3 22:42:13 2015 UTC,"Well I pretty much love everything, so well done, but I especially love that very familiar chair. I've been drooling over it for a couple years now. Those arms...yummy."

Mid_Century,2r6srr,kevan,5,Sat Jan 3 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"It's a ""Sputnik Chandelier"" and I got it for only $150.  Those rascals can quickly run you into a grand or two for a decent size. I prowled eBay for a solid five months trying to find one under $700. You can find cheap repros in a silver finish new for about $175. The brass is the priciest (sexiest)."
Mid_Century,2r6srr,SARASA05,3,Sat Jan 3 19:38:20 2015 UTC,I was promised more photos.
Mid_Century,2r6srr,mirthquake,3,Thu Jan 15 04:13:57 2015 UTC,I've seen them on Ebay and the price is outta my reach. Did you find yours on ebay? I like yours over the Amazon-linked one above. I want to replace a standard brass chandelier above my dining table with the right piece. I have two George Nelson round bubble lamps and two vintage silk asian lotus flower lamp shades that I've thought about hanging above the table but two might be overdone and I would need to hire an electrician and drywall guy to patch the ceiling... Do you think two would be overdone? Tough decisions!
Mid_Century,2r6srr,kanooka,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"As OP said, you can find sylish, well-made examples of sputnik-style ceiling lamps on ebay, craigslist, estate sales, and in other direct-from-seller markets for under $200 if you're patient. My friend has an extraordinary period example--the sort you'd see on 1st Dibs listed at $1,200--that she nabbed for under $100 at an estate sale. My hunch is that many buyers of mid century-style lighting opt for contemporary reproductions rather than pay through the nose for an original that may have faulty wiring or (gasp!) be a repro. If you learn enough to spot an authentic piece when you see one, then sooner or later you'll see one for very little money. Perhaps even at a thrift store. Have fun searching!"

Mid_Century,2r4ti0,hairhatgentleman,5,Fri Jan 2 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"At first I thought your orchid was a collection of vintage, silk Asian lotus (or maybe orchid!?) lamps and almost went crazy but how awesome that could be.

Not so much MCM but I still appreciate the design and construction: https://www.etsy.com/listing/200263495/vintage-asian-lotus-flower-lamp-shades?ref=market Your room looks nice and lived in, not staged for a photograph."

Mid_Century,2r4ti0,thebeesremain,3,Fri Jan 2 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Did you reupholster the sofa yourself, or take it someplace?"
Mid_Century,2r4ti0,gnarbone,2,Fri Jan 2 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"I tend to reupholster things myself. If they're easy. The sofa was a little beyond my skill set so I had a local guy do it. I pulled it out of an old bowling ally, rough shape. Reupholstered in a commercial grey felt and black vinyl piping."
Mid_Century,2r54am,2wholemichelinas,4,Fri Jan 2 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'd follow the standard restoration process. Give it a nice sanding, and then coat it in your choice of marine sealant and polish. Here's the guide."

Mid_Century,2r54am,identicalcousins,4,Sat Jan 3 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"Chairfag here, I hope our technique works for you. Your shell looks faded but take your time with the wet sanding process and you will see the payoff when you apply the Penetrol. Please remember to do several light coats and not one heavy coat.

Mid_Century,2r54am,identicalcousins,2,Mon Jan 5 04:33:37 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. I'll be sure to post pics of the results once I can get my hands on some penetrol."

I wouldn't pay more than $50. Whoever you're talking to about this piece for $240 is giddy thinking you'll pay that much."
Mid_Century,2r19qo,SARASA05,4,Thu Jan 1 21:10:48 2015 UTC,(sorry if I busted your enthusiasm). The mirror is a pretty shape!
Mid_Century,2r19qo,SARASA05,3,Thu Jan 1 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll let it pass"
Mid_Century,2r19qo,SARASA05,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"You'll find something better and you'll be glad you waited. I found a table that I loved the silhouette of, but it was poorly painted a horrible grey and had pieces of wood nailed to it to strengthen the weak legs. I paid $50 for the table and it has just been sitting in my shed. I have great plans to try to strip the piece and bring it back to life someday, but I don't even know if that's possible (I've never done this before) and I regularly regret the $50 I spent on the table plus hassling my dad to deliver the thing, and the $$ I've spent on paint stripper and other materials. But... when (if?) I get around to it, should be a fun project & experiment. Anyway, some of the amazing pieces and bargains others in this subreddit find, I'm sure you'll find the right piece eventually. Good luck in your hunt."
Mid_Century,2r19qo,kevan,2,Fri Jan 2 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"This is correct. A person's time is valuable. Let's say you can re-do this in 10 hours of work. (Which is a really, really low estimation in my opinion.) If you consider your time at $8 an hour, plus supplies to refinish, this would effectively cost over $350.  Someone else mentioned that we don't know if the paint is hiding problems. My $350 estimation above is extremely optimistic."
Mid_Century,2r19qo,Woolio,13,Fri Jan 2 04:02:09 2015 UTC,"Depends. If they sanded it before they painted it, the veneer's pretty much ruined. If that's the case, it's going to be worth a whole lot less than $240.   And, honestly, I never buy painted pieces because I don't want to support this kind of behavior. If you buy this, they'll think it's worth doing, and what's stopping them from going out and destroying more antique furniture after that? I don't want to be an enabler for the problem."
Mid_Century,2r19qo,yourmommo,5,Thu Jan 1 21:18:04 2015 UTC,I agree. I recently went to an antique store and I saw a Jens Risom round coffee table that had been painted over as well as a round Lane one. It's sad that people think painting over vintage and antique pieces makes them better.
Mid_Century,2r19qo,Woolio,10,Thu Jan 1 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"Ooh, don't even get me started. The amount of Broyhill I see painted around here drives me insane. I saw a listing on Craigslist the other day saying, ""We're having a furniture sale because my hobby has taken over the garage,"" and it was an entire three-car garage filled with 50s-60s modern furniture that looked like it had been through a paint run. It looked like Jackson Pollock vomited over everything in varying shades of chartreuse and poo.   I honestly don't get it, I really don't. I know they say ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder,"" but some people really need to get their eyes checked. Or gouged out."

This will he veneer underneath and will be almost impossible to strip, but a professional should be able to rebuild the doors and draws.   Take the estimated cost of restoration off the price they are asking, if they say yes... I'd do it."

Mid_Century,2r19qo,horsenbuggy,1 point,Fri Jan 2 00:06:54 2015 UTC,$240 is a good price if you want to leave it white. Not if you want to refinish.
Mid_Century,2r19qo,Woolio,2,Thu Jan 1 23:56:27 2015 UTC,I'll probably be kicked out of the sub for saying this but this is one of the few times where I like the paint job maybe better than the original finish. This would look great in a house near the coast. Love that mirror.
Mid_Century,2r19qo,WildeCat96,3,Fri Jan 2 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you here, this was actually tastefully done. Would I prefer it in the original woodgrain?

Now I just have to find an ottoman and contact Knoll to figure out the fabric to match. This chair was purchased for a government building and that is the reason it has the cross base holding the legs. I was told that at the time of purchase, this increased the cost of the chair by $700 from Knoll. I'm partial to the X base, but at least I know its sturdy and will last the test of time."

I didn't really know what type of cordage to use, but since someone mentioned Danish Cord, I googled it and found a place that has a large inventory of caning and re-weaving supplies. My chairs were hand made by my wife's grandfather, and they probably used some sort of cotton cordage. I'd guess that he made them in the 60's or 70's and they are all falling apart now. I just may make it my 2015 project to restore them, or learn to make cushions for another restoration project. Cheers."

A fun little home decor and gift store downtown was going out of business and had been using this and other mid century pieces as display for their products. They are unfortunately closing today and wanted as much merchandise and furniture gone as possible. I asked if they would take $200 and they said yes! I'm so excited :)  They also had that credenza (last pic of the album) in the store but it wasn't for sale. I would have snagged that in a heartbeat as well.  I also also got a whole bunch of new merchandise, such as that teapot, the owl pitcher, and the canisters, etc. It was a very productive day, haha.  Edit: I just realized you can see the signed and numbered Charley Harper print my Dad gave me for Christmas on the wall in a couple pics, so there's that as well!"

Mid_Century,2qkui5,iamlowsound,3,Sun Dec 28 05:16:54 2014 UTC,Maybe Johns-Manville? (which would be asbestos tile unfort)
Mid_Century,2qkui5,dovecotes,3,Sun Dec 28 01:25:29 2014 UTC,"Even if you could find the tile, a new version wouldn't match (there's just no way to ensure color matching across 50 years), and even new-old-stock tile would likely not match because the tile in your house would be faded from exposure."
Mid_Century,2qkui5,asad137,3,Sun Dec 28 02:37:53 2014 UTC,"Very unlikely that you'll be able to find replacements.  Like others have mentioned, try to salvage some from under your appliances/cabinets.  If that doesn't work out, you could always replace all of them with some new Armstrong VCT.  If you go that route, cut them down to the size that is currently there in order to keep a period look. ;)"
Mid_Century,2qkui5,cseyferth,2,Sun Dec 28 06:44:29 2014 UTC,"I am doing some work on my kitchen and I need to do some repairs to sub flooring and replace a few tiles.

Also,  I am getting the tile tested for asbestos content before I do the work."
Mid_Century,2qkui5,midcenturymonster,3,Sun Dec 28 01:22:34 2014 UTC,"If you can't find a match, consider seeing if you can poach from underneath appliances like the fridge.

Mid_Century,2qhnz7,astraelly,5,Sat Dec 27 00:44:10 2014 UTC,"The thing you've got to understand about a lot of modern branded reproductions of mid-century pieces is that, today, you're primarily paying for the brand.   This is a lamp. Lamps are hard to screw up. I'd go with the replica.   If it were something bigger, like an Eames Lounge or something where the money does make a difference, I'd recommend you buy the real thing... But again, this is a lamp. Short of replacing the bulb with something beefier, I can't say you would get a bad lamp for $300.   Worst case scenario, you end up returning it. Best case, you get a good lamp. I say go for it."
Mid_Century,2qhnz7,Woolio,2,Sat Dec 27 02:34:47 2014 UTC,That makes a lot of sense to me! We'll probably go with the replica. Thanks for the input.

Mid_Century,2qbb00,mirthquake,6,Wed Dec 24 21:48:27 2014 UTC,The chair was made in about 1959-1967 (when Knoll was Art Metal). Knoll actually sold the company to art metal and then Heller and then the company turned back to Knoll.
Mid_Century,2qbb00,yourmommo,3,Wed Dec 24 22:51:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much! Do you know how furniture from this period is compared to, say, similar Knoll releases from after 1967? Are pieces from '59-'67 valued more because they are older and were designer during the ""proper"" Mid-Century Modern period, or are they less desirable than pieces made by ""Knoll"" proper in the late 60s/early 70s?"
Mid_Century,2qbb00,yourmommo,3,Fri Dec 26 01:27:01 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I don't think there is a significant difference in ""desirability"" because all of the products were overseen by Knoll."
Mid_Century,2qbb00,brass_and_rosewood,2,Sat Dec 27 00:09:28 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if you are saying otherwise, but I just wanted to emphasize that the 1970s are definitely part of the mid-century modern design movement. Many notable designers (like Paul Evans, Milo Baughman and others) working in the 1970s are squarely part of the mid-century modern design period. Although mathematically speaking the 1970s are closer to the end of the century than the middle, the design sensibility for many furniture makers is still distinctly part of the mid-century modern movement. It's really not until the very late 1970s and into the 1980s that the modernist design movement wanes in popularity and fades away. Late modernist movements like the Memphis Style of the late 1970s and 1980s go in new directions but also serve to wrap up four decades of innovative design exploration and do not break from the modernist tradition to form a new design period."

Mid_Century,2qbr9w,kman563,2,Thu Dec 25 00:50:40 2014 UTC,Do you have a photo?  The reason the values are all over the place is because there is no such thing as a fixed value until somesone puts down the money to buy something. The truth is that different buyers will pay different amounts depending on where they are purchasing from. A high end showroom might try asking a couple thousand for that chair while the same chair would sell on eBay or craigslist for a few hundred and a vendor at a flea market might only be able to ask a hundred or two and a junk store / estate clean out place might only be able to ask $75 or less. It sounds like you probably don't have a store so you will have to sell it on eBay or craigslist if you decide to eventually not keep it.  If the chair is leather it would be worth more but with the fabric it also depends on the color. It is usually never worth reupholstering anything unless you own a showroom store to sell the piece in or the piece is an iconic modern design piece like a Papa Bear Chair. Sometimes a reupholsterer with little experience with modernist design will screwup or miss altogether important subtleties of the design and make a piece worthless.  What are they asking for the chair?
Mid_Century,2qbr9w,brass_and_rosewood,2,Thu Dec 25 13:18:50 2014 UTC,"Hey Brass,  Sorry, I thought I included a photo before. Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/fLw0NUW.jpg  The chair is fabric, not leather. Thanks for the info about reupholstering. I am just starting to get into furniture and these are good things to think about.  The private seller is asking for $750, but I think I could get it for $650."
Mid_Century,2qbr9w,brass_and_rosewood,5,Fri Dec 26 03:46:46 2014 UTC,"$650 is a fair retail price. The seller is definitely a dealer, no question about it. They know the maker's name and know the market well. They are offering the chair for less than what a store would sell it for but more than what a store would want to buy it for. Buy the chair if you love the piece, but don't expect to be able to make any money by relisting it for more anytime in the next few years.  I would definitely not get into reupholstering a chair like that. The craftsmanship would never match the original exactly right and would cost several hundred dollars plus the cost of finding original replacement fabric or something authentic enough to look half decent.  Again, if you really love the chair and that is the lounge chair you want to live with then get it. You won't find it in a store for any less."
Mid_Century,2q8pb8,mirthquake,4,Wed Dec 24 03:07:34 2014 UTC,"It's a recent piece, if it's by BiF Korea. Could be on the tail end of the mid-century period, could be newer. The company's been around for 47 years, and they specialize in mid-mod style furniture now, so it makes it hard to pinpoint.  Additionally, it's a lateral file. Office furniture's rarely worth collecting unless it's a big name, or a rarer design."
Mid_Century,2q8pb8,Woolio,3,Wed Dec 24 10:11:20 2014 UTC,"BiF Korea is not a collectable company. Mostly this is because none of the famous industrial designers of the period were ever working for them designing pieces.   Are you sure the piece is teak? Either way, beyond it's utility to you as a piece of furniture I don't think it has any collectable value unfortunately.  Edit: spelling"

Mid_Century,2q37rr,hazertag,9,Mon Dec 22 18:12:03 2014 UTC,"That house is amazing. Remember that if you do have the room in your budget to retrofit, there are lots of products available now that would bring an older structure up to modern insulation standards. You just have to have the money in your pocket to invest in the property.  Thin walls can be mitigated with spray on insulation foam. Windows can be replaced with triple pane energy efficient ones and even coated with UV reflection. There are after market solar reflector window films that work quite well and more efficient HVAC systems. You could even offset some increased cost with an investment in solar power.  Having lived in and remodeled two century homes in Canada, I will tell you that all older houses need the owners' patience and good planning to bring into livability. Frankly, I would much rather deal with a mid century place than yet another Edwardian with a leaky basement and zero insulation in attic or walls.  EDIT: I am also staggered by how affordable that is. Jesus, housing in Canada is expensive in comparison. I live in a 1500 sq ft bungalow that just got evaluated at 10k more than the asking on that property in the link. Believe me, mine is NOWHERE near as nice as this. Mine is modern suburban crap, a newer build with thin walls and not enough insulation..."

Those pre-fab Cliff May homes in Harvey Park are built cheaply and the neighborhood is going to take a long time to get back to a respectable state. The home is definitely not even close to being worth the asking price and they're just capitalizing on the popularity of mid-century homes in Denver.
Mid_Century,2q37rr,riomx,2,Tue Dec 23 06:57:10 2014 UTC,"Care to expand?  The neighborhood is C+ at best, and many of the MCM homes are yet to be updated. That being said it is respectably close to the city center, esp compared to Krisana Park.   What are your statements based on? Is it possible that they improved upon those reasons you say they were built on the cheap, and thats why the asking price is ""high""? Even relative to $ per SF, it doesnt seem to be commanding much of a premium relative to the market."
Mid_Century,2q37rr,kenfar,2,Fri Dec 26 17:32:40 2014 UTC,"I've lived for a decade in Denver. I have plenty of experience with renting and am currently a homeowner. I've done my homework when it comes to neighborhoods and home values.  My wife and I live in Park Hill. We live 10 minutes from Capitol Hill and 15 minutes from Downtown. We live in a brick home built in 1947 with a generous lot in a neighborhood that has grown in demand in 3 years. Our home has appreciated 100K in value in that time.  Harvey Park was rough and many homes were terribly neglected when we went and looked. We stopped to check out some of the Cliff May homes and were underwhelmed. The designs may be attractive, but they were built with cheap wood exteriors and with very small floorplans, often on small lots.  The prices these homes are going for are based on popularity of mid-century design trends than anything else. Also, these homes are often remodeled by flippers rather than people who are actually familiar and sensitive to mid-century home restoration.  I would look at Lynwood or Krisana Park before I would look at Harvey Park. It's a rough neighborhood that's going to take decades to get better, and in my opinion, quite far from downtown and everything interesting that Denver has to offer."
Mid_Century,2q37rr,kenfar,2,Fri Dec 26 21:35:54 2014 UTC,"I live in Boulder in a mid-50s ranch that's reasonably mid-century.  Almost any house built more than 20 years ago will be dated regarding insulation.  Go farther back and you start hitting electrical issues, etc.  The windows, and especially any steel or aluminum trim really need to be upgraded for our cold climate.  But once the upgrades are done they can work very well out here:  we get great weather.   And if you combine some form of awning to stop the summer sun from coming in the right big windows can really warm up your house in the winter.   Then if you've got a good view those windows can be a great part of your house."

Mid_Century,2pu7n5,mirthquake,2,Sat Dec 20 14:06:48 2014 UTC,"Great post. These auction results are fascinating. Aside from the Noguchi table, some of those Gio Ponti chairs and industrial lighting fixtures are exciting to simply look at. Who is Alice Walton, and why is it significant that she may have bought the Noguchi table? I know Noguchi's work relatively well--my girlfriend worked at the Noguchi Museum in Queens, NY for the last year--and I grew up attending high-end furniture auctions with my antique dealer father. What's the significance of the $4.5 million figure? Does this mark the highest ticket price for a piece of MCM furniture?"
Mid_Century,2pu7n5,rodface,3,Mon Dec 22 23:22:19 2014 UTC,To answer one of your questions: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Walton
Mid_Century,2pu7n5,autowikibot,3,Tue Dec 23 04:18:56 2014 UTC,"Alice Walton:       Alice Louise Walton (born October 7, 1949) is an American heiress to the fortune of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. She is the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and Helen Walton, and sister of S. Robson Walton and Jim Walton. Her estimated net worth is US$34.3 billion, making her the third-richest woman in the world (behind her sister-in-law Christy Walton and Liliane Bettencourt).  As of February 2014, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index her estimated net worth was US$33.9 billion, making her the 13th richest person in the world.

Mid_Century,2ptvvq,killdie,3,Sat Dec 20 03:35:22 2014 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. It looks like a slick set of photos which means they are going to be asking a high price. For a high price you can just go to vintage store and have your pick of mid-century furniture. I really only feel like I've missed out on a piece when it was a $1,500 piece listed for an asking price of $100 and I didn't get to if first."

Mid_Century,2pmz00,olalaelaine,3,Thu Dec 18 01:34:52 2014 UTC,I picked this chair up at Goodwill this past summer and didn't think anything of it until this evening when I saw a similar upholstered chair selling for a substantial amount of money online. This chair is stamped Sep 11 1957 - Herman Miller Furniture Company. The chair is fiberglass shell with a dark green nearly black upholstery fabric. I can see something that looks a little like masking tape near some of the edges where the fabric goes over the lip of the chair. I've also noticed the legs seem a little different from what I see on other similar chairs and that it seems a little more narrow. I'd be interested in finding more about the chair and possibly selling it to someone who could better care for and appreciate its value. You might see my creepy cat in the second photo. She's known to scratch things and I'd hate to see this get ruined.
Mid_Century,2pmz00,Woolio,8,Thu Dec 18 01:41:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's a DAX-1 from 1957. I have one with orange nagahyde, but the black hopsack is worth considerably more in good condition. I got mine for $80 because the base was scratched up and the upholstery was pulling apart, as these were known to do, but it had a really well-kept fiberglass shell underneath that I'm sitting in right now.   These were some of the first upholstered shells, most of them had a dark gray or beige applique on the back, and the upholstery itself was actually removable. Don't remove it. It doesn't go back on.   Anyway, standard rules apply. Clean any stains with an oxy-clean and water solution, clean the fiberglass with some soap and water, but don't put too much elbow grease into it. Depending on your market, you can expect about $200-500 for this, maybe more if you get lucky on eBay. It's a nice chair, though, and it'd run you $600+ new today, so it might be worth hanging onto.   You can learn more here: http://eamesdesigns.com/catalog/seating/sort/year-asc/page/4/"
Mid_Century,2pmz00,Woolio,3,Thu Dec 18 01:48:54 2014 UTC,"Oh wonderful! Thank you so much for the information. The chair appears to be in good condition, a few dirt spots here and there on the upholstery, but nothing that seems like a stain. The upholstery is firmly on the chair, but I did see where I could take it off (I didn't attempt to, but I could see when I examined the masking tape that it felt removable). It's been a while since I bought the chair, but I think I paid less than $10. I'll keep an eye online and see how prices go, but I take it that it is not a considerably rare chair. My biggest concern now would really be maintaining its condition with a pawsy cat around the house."
Mid_Century,2pmz00,quick_q_throwaway,3,Thu Dec 18 02:00:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the difference in the upholstery between your model and newer ones is that your upholstery is only taped to the chair, whereas newer chairs have the upholstery glued on. It's lucky, because if the upholstery does ever get beat up, you can take it off and have a good fiberglass shell.   Anyway, they're not too rare, all things considered. I own two. They were mass-produced for something like 40 years, and now HM's making them again, but they're great furniture.   Also, thanks for the Gold!"
Mid_Century,2pmz00,quick_q_throwaway,3,Thu Dec 18 02:36:39 2014 UTC,No problem. Thanks for your help. I really appreciate your time and information. I'm really new to the idea of mid century furniture stuffs. I've been finding and buying these pieces because I thought they were cool. Didn't even think about them being worth something or that other people liked the style any more.
Mid_Century,2pmz00,SOY_REINDEER_GRANDE,2,Thu Dec 18 04:38:32 2014 UTC,"Not too great color way, and h base   Not worth too much.   You want an original zenith parchment h base for money, or a Herman miller dowel or Eiffel base (original) dont slap modernica zinc bases on them trying to rip people off! it's obvious  You can buy arm chair h base chairs in unattractive goodwill color ways for like $45-80 out here in california"
Mid_Century,2pmz00,F-That,2,Sun Dec 21 02:50:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I don't live anywhere near California. I'm not super crazy about the color, but I can say it did not photograph well at all; it's very much closer to a black. I've kind of determined the H base is typically the least desirable, but I really didn't have any intention of changing it out. My fiance and I have talked about whether to sell or not. Not certain yet, but if we chose to sell, even of it only fetched 100$ it would be a nice ROI because we only paid 8$ for it."
Mid_Century,2pmz00,F-That,2,Sun Dec 21 04:05:52 2014 UTC,"Well, you have to learn to think critically, most of the demand for these chairs come from tumblr and Pinterest browsing gen x people with a skew towards the creative side. Can you see a green chair next to a minimalist layout next to a Robert longo or a banksy print?   Another thing to consider, there are 2 official sources for the modern day plastic eames chairs vitra and Herman miller. And a brand that remans vintage chairs on old Herman miller equipment (modernica). So your chair has to have features that inherently make it valuable and a condition that does not detract from the value.   With that said the upholstered chairs have holes drilled through the base of the chair (strike one), the original zinc coated h base is the least desirable, used often times on school chairs (strike 2), it's not white, the most desirable color (strike 3)   The only thing you have going for it is that it is a real Herman miller, fiberglass shell.   The chairs are made using pressed fiberglass sheets, then coated in epoxy to prevent cat hair fibers from getting to the users skin (itchy)   The upholstered shells had less coating on the front. (Strike 4)   It's an amazing chair, but honestly I wouldn't try to make a living hunting down rare furniture because rare furniture is rare and valuable for that reason.   I would honestly just convert your shell chair to a piece to be used and not flipped for profit. I mean the prices some uninformed people guesstimated at are above a Herman miller modern day plastic shell with a rocker base, or vitra Eiffel base with chrome rather than zinc! I can drve down and buy one on the super Saturday sale for less than that.   Again remeber the ones that sell are worth the asking price, I can ask $900 for a beat up broken weld rusty eames wire chair but nobody is going to pay it.   Just like how all old ferraris aren't worth 1million, all eames chairs don't command a hefty price tag.   Sorry :("

The exterior walls look like some kind of manmade building material board like MDF but a 1950s version that does't fall apart in the elements. It's not asbestos.  Edit: There isn't any stucco. The white ceiling is just painted wood boards. Under the house too it is all cypress boards."

We are basically just going to bring it back to it's original 1950s condition with a new roof, upgraded electric, and updated drainage/sewer. The plan is to keep the walls and the original fixtures and even get the oven working again. Everything that is painted now will get a fresh coat of matching color paint and everything that is wood will be cleaned. The plan is even to keep all of the original windows that are still functional. The only question is whether to keep the toilets and what to put on the floors to replace the linoleum tiles."

Mid_Century,2ph0wj,LooksBleeker,2,Wed Dec 17 01:31:20 2014 UTC,Inefficient for keeping cold air in and hot air out in the summer? If he installs new windows that make a perfect seal then he will have to run air conditioning year round to keep mold from forming. This house was built to not require air conditioning to stay mold-free. The idea is the keep the air outside and the air inside flowing together. This house hasn't been lived in since 1999 and there isn't a single mold spot. It's quite amazing actually.
Mid_Century,2ph0wj,crogginator,4,Wed Dec 17 12:56:10 2014 UTC,"From experience--Jalousie windows are a huge pain in the ass, terribly inefficient, and it's getting harder and harder to find quality parts. I would definitely consider replacing if you can put it in the budget."
Mid_Century,2ph0wj,Hodaka,2,Wed Dec 17 04:43:24 2014 UTC,They are only inefficient if you are trying to air condition the house around the clock. This house was built to naturally stay cool with the overhanging roof and windows on all walls. The moment he replaces the windows with newer windows that make a perfect seal then the air will be stagnant inside and the mold will start to form. If the house is sealed up then he will have to run the air conditioning for the rest of the life of the house just to keep the moisture down. Mostly the windows are in good working order so for the time being at least we will hold on to them.
Mid_Century,2ph0wj,straigh,5,Wed Dec 17 13:03:00 2014 UTC,Restoring a mid century house to its former glory would be my dream project. More sconce pictures please ;)

Mid_Century,2ph0wj,strong_grey_hero,3,Tue Dec 16 22:15:41 2014 UTC,"These pictures are great, thank you.  Was this home just completely abandoned since the sixties? The place doesnt look like it's been lived in since then."
Mid_Century,2ph0wj,foryourbr0ats,2,Wed Dec 17 01:53:44 2014 UTC,His grandmother lived in the house up until 1999. Then one day she had to go to the hospital unexpectedly and after the hospital stay she moved into a home with nursing care. She never came back to the house. I think someone came to pickup her clothes and toiletries but other than that the house sat untouched since 1999. There was still a load of clean dishes in the dishwasher from the day she left.
Mid_Century,2ph0wj,jbrackett,3,Wed Dec 17 13:09:22 2014 UTC,Just awesome that it will be owned by someone who appreciates the original style... So many people would have gutted the charm out of it.

Mid_Century,2phf6b,MISTER_SEVENTEENFIVE,5,Tue Dec 16 17:06:32 2014 UTC,Miller's Mid Century Modern might be what you are looking for.

It's a companion piece to a BBC documentary I would highly recommend watching and reading. (you can find it easily on youtube)  Neither of these will give you a reference to value. Perhaps consider a membership to worthpoint.com? I can't vouch for it myself, i'm not a seller but if I was I would look into it."
Mid_Century,2pivjn,Aceofhearts94,3,Wed Dec 17 00:12:52 2014 UTC,"Remember that reproductions, especially unauthorized reproductions, will not maintain their value over time whereas original vintage pieces will become the collectable antiques of this era. For about the same price or less you can probably find any of those items if you spend some time on eBay or craigslist looking around for what you want."
Mid_Century,2pivjn,brass_and_rosewood,2,Sat Dec 20 14:32:13 2014 UTC,No idea but I find some of their pricing quite odd. Like this Kofod Larsen chair is not cheap at $759 while their Womb chair almost laughably inexpensive. I would guess they are sourcing from different manufacturers.

Mid_Century,2pdpgs,Woolio,3,Tue Dec 16 01:10:36 2014 UTC,Those look really familiar.  I wonder if our airport has them or where I've been that I've seen those airport chairs before?
Mid_Century,2pdpgs,Cat_Chat_Roulette,5,Mon Dec 15 20:09:32 2014 UTC,They are a super common chair used in airports. I can't even think of a specific place that has them because they are so plentiful. I pretty much assume as a default that whatever airport I'm in is going to have them.  Once I had to sleep overnight in an airport (possibly Tampa?) and I was cursing those chairs for their damn armrests.

A so-so original is often more sought after than a perfect piece that has had work done.  That being said, I typically don't have a problem with refinishing unless it is a true antique (pre-war American hardwood furniture) or you decide to go shabby-chique and paint it.  If you're interested in refurbishing/restoring, take it to someone local who would specialize in this sort of thing and get their input. It may be very straight forward, or it may not be worth it at all."

Mid_Century,2p3s4x,vincent_vancough,2,Sat Dec 13 02:10:45 2014 UTC,I'll research those. How does this sound?  http://www.westelm.com/m/products/mid-century-desk-acorn-h209/
Mid_Century,2p3s4x,vincent_vancough,3,Sat Dec 13 02:52:28 2014 UTC,"West Elm is OK, but they are not designer. They are just derivative of mid century modern design influence. The reason people on this sub buy vintage items is because they are quality, authentic pieces at a discount by renowned and timeless designers. Also it is worth saying that true designer items will retain their value pretty well.   But if you just want looks and function, get what is in your price range or what fits in your space. The are lots of sites that do decent reproductions of classic pieces."
Mid_Century,2p3s4x,mullacc,2,Sat Dec 13 03:39:17 2014 UTC,"I have a 5'x2.5' Ikea table top that works great for a similar setup. It's obviously not a designer MCM piece, but I think it looks just fine next to my George Nelson cabinet."
Mid_Century,2p3s4x,brass_and_rosewood,2,Sat Dec 13 18:53:16 2014 UTC,There are tons of teak and rosewood Danish partners desks out there from the period that would probably work well. You could probably pick one up on Craigslist for $400-$700 depending on where you are.

Mid_Century,2p0fol,sowalsh,3,Thu Dec 11 21:49:04 2014 UTC,It's about $120 cheaper if you email them.
Mid_Century,2p0fol,UncleAugie,2,Thu Dec 11 21:58:28 2014 UTC,"Overall, the quality is very good. The wood finishing is a little heavy handed for my taste and there is a distinct red color in the staining that I am not a fan of. If it keeps bothering me I will sand it and refinish."
Mid_Century,2p0fol,mullacc,2,Thu Dec 11 21:24:35 2014 UTC,"I am about to make something similar, working on piecing together all of my supplies. Like the look of this one. Thinking about mine in oak, with a lighter finish but with the same rounded edges, planning on two chairs and a three seater couch."
Mid_Century,2p0fol,MatJosher,2,Thu Dec 11 22:10:40 2014 UTC,"Oh, you posted a while back asking if anyone had experience with Design to Live By. Thanks for following up!  Looks great."
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,straigh,7,Thu Dec 11 15:19:47 2014 UTC,"Love that  tree! Would love to see you change the paint of the room to something more historical to the era like benjamin Moore's Wythe blue.  Your dining table and furniture would really pop against that color.  Color  Some Franciscan starburst dinnerware would look pretty great, too."
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,didnotwanttoregister,3,Thu Dec 11 16:59:15 2014 UTC,"Me too! But we're hoping to move into an actual midcentury home soon so we're not investing a ton in the house right now. My fiance painted the walls before we met, and that's the color he was going for but... he paints cars, not houses- ha! I have quite the collection of paint chips in my cabinets. I actually got a message yesterday from a friend whose mother had every single piece of Franciscan starburst anything that was ever made (they had lots of expendable cash...) and he wants to sell them to me ""cheap"" (minus the pieces that have broken over the years.) So now a hunt for a hutch or china cabinet begins!"
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,didnotwanttoregister,3,Thu Dec 11 17:09:34 2014 UTC,"Holy shit sounds like you've hit the mother load for franciscan starburst. I  have a few pieces (platters, pitcher, teacups/saucers) but not many. Jealous! Prices just keep going up on ebay.  I found my mid century hutch by searching through every buffet/hutch item on Craig's list.  You really only find good craigslist deals anymore unless the  person puts on a generic label like ""chair"" or ""hutch"" and nothing else."
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,didnotwanttoregister,2,Thu Dec 11 17:14:05 2014 UTC,"I know! Our deals have all come from someone not knowing what they have. That being said, we definitely paid for the Pearsall and vintage lamps in the background :3 We got three vintage aluminum Christmas trees, two color wheels, and a rotating tree base (some in original boxes, some not) for $264. My god. We were able to sell the extra trees and color wheel to fund our new table! Love when things work out like that!"
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,jonesey1955,3,Thu Dec 11 17:44:37 2014 UTC,Oh man you should  have kept all the trees! No one says you can't  have more than one on display for the season:) Pretty sure I will have one in every room in a few years..
Mid_Century,2oz7vn,Eyken_VonBryken,3,Thu Dec 11 18:07:38 2014 UTC,I wanted to! My fiance hates Christmas and originally said no decorating .. Of course that's absurd but even he thought it was funny that we went from 0 to tree farm in one day!

I like all the national park posters, though.  Im lucky to live in Cincinnati where Harper was from and did a lot of work for our local park systems. There are a lot of prints floating around here.  Our Lumenocity celebration this year had a Charlie Harper theme and commemoration, everyone who loves Harper should check it out here http://youtu.be/Ba1oozpNic4  They literally brought Harper's art to life with a light show on the backdrop of Cincinnati's historic music hall building."

Cant wait for next year. :)   You should be able  to find additional clips from the shows on youtube if you're interested, although the link I provided already shows everything from the Harper commemoration."
Mid_Century,2ox03o,didnotwanttoregister,2,Thu Dec 11 17:25:35 2014 UTC,"I don't know much about Cincinnati. Is that a real building they are projecting the lights onto? It's a little hard to tell since it was so dark if that was the shape of the actual building or if that was just a construct of the light show.   The orchestra was great, too. I wish I lived closer. It seems like a really fantastic event."
Mid_Century,2ox03o,tallread1,2,Thu Dec 11 17:35:43 2014 UTC,"Yes its called architectural 3D light mapping, they are projecting the images on top of the facade of our historic Music Hall building. There were other parts of the shows where they play with the buildings shapes and make it look like the building is moving around/melting/etc.   This clip shows them playing around with the architecture a bit more."
Mid_Century,2ox03o,tallread1,2,Thu Dec 11 17:40:53 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, you can see the building a lot more clearly in the beginning of that one. I like the random robot attacking the crowd haha. What a great idea for a community event."

Mid_Century,2otgzv,LordOfMurderMountain,2,Wed Dec 10 20:20:25 2014 UTC,I actually don't have any info. I have a pair and they're walnut but I haven't been able to find anything else! Any info would be much appreciated.
Mid_Century,2otgzv,brass_and_rosewood,4,Wed Dec 10 02:29:57 2014 UTC,What's your story with them? How did you acquire them? Are you sure they are walnut? My guess is that they are teak. Do they have any markings or tags? Can you post some photos of the back and the seat with the cushions removed? I might be able to ID it that way. They look like a lounge Chair by Peter Hvidt & Orla MÃ¸lgaard Nielsen but the boards on the side of yours have a sculpted dip whereas the Hvidt version is just a straight cut line.
Mid_Century,2otgzv,brass_and_rosewood,3,Wed Dec 10 15:02:17 2014 UTC,This is picture of the second one without the cushions. The only mark is where it's stamped walnut and what seems to be a model number? I've tried looking it up without much luck.  http://i.imgur.com/lJthbqV.jpg http://i.imgur.com/II6wpHk.jpg
Mid_Century,2otgzv,MarsNeedsGuitars,3,Wed Dec 10 18:44:53 2014 UTC,"Very interesting piece. It could be a Yugoslavian knock off of a Danish chair because it isn't teak. If you want to check one more time for marks you could carefully look for a pressed in indented mark on the back side of the front bar under the seat or the underside of the front overhanging seat board. If it is Yugoslavian it will have a faint indented mark saying MADE IN YUGOSLAVIA in tall narrow letters. Do the cushions have a different color on the bottom side, like a tartan pattern?  It is probably Danish, but either way it is a great looking chair and I love the red cushions!"
Mid_Century,2otgzv,Olive_Jane,4,Wed Dec 10 19:48:52 2014 UTC,"Both red tweed top and bottom, I'll have to check for anymore marks and thanks! I'll probably be posting a lot more of my finds"
Mid_Century,2otgzv,hazertag,2,Wed Dec 10 19:59:14 2014 UTC,The story is my boyfriends parent picked them up at s goodwill in the 80s and put them in the attic when they were able to afford new furniture. They've been in the attic for probably 20 years until I found out about them and had to have them!
Mid_Century,2or4dy,brass_and_rosewood,11,Tue Dec 9 13:36:27 2014 UTC,"The story of how I acquired this chandelier starts a little over a year ago. I went to an art gallery opening for their final exhibition before moving to a new location. They were on the top floor of a big office building that was set to be converted into condos starting in a few weeks. All of the tenant offices had to be out by the end of the month so this opening was their last party in the space. I was super giddy when noticed that in their office they had an original burl wood and chrome Paul Evans credenza. The condition wasn't great but I knew it was still crazy valuable and could be repaired. I also knew how heavy it was and that it would be a pain for them to move to their new location. As I was leaving the exhibition I asked the people in the office about the piece and if they would be taking it with them. They seemed to know it was valuable but didn't know much about it and certainly weren't as appreciative of the piece as I was. I told them that if they weren't going to bring it to their new location to please give me a call. They said they were definitely taking it but I left my number for them anyway.  A month later, on the day the gallery had to be out of the building I got a call from them at 3:45 PM. They said they weren't taking the credenza and that if I could get it out of the building before 5:00 PM then it was all mine (for free!!!). They said that if I didn't make it there by 5:00 PM the doors would be locked and the crew renovating the space for the next occupants would break the cabinet down into boards and throw it in the dumpster the next morning. Well, I dropped everything and bolted over to the gallery. I got there by 4:30 PM.  With 30 minutes to spare the cabinet was sitting in the same place I saw it the night of the opening, the rest of the office was empty, and everybody was gone. I tried to move the cabinet but it was too heavy to budge on my own. Right then the security guards for the building came by and said they wanted me out and that the maintenance staff was about to turn off the freight elevators for the night. I started to panic. I told them I'd be right back. I frantically ran through the buildings trash rooms and storage areas until I found a dolly! I grabbed a guy walking in the hallway 3 floors down, handed him a few bucks and asked him to help me for a minute. We ran back to the empty gallery and maneuvered the Paul Evans onto the dolly and into the freight elevator and out on to the street.  Shit! How am I going to get this thing home? I thought to myself. I searched on Craigslist for ""man with van"" and found some guys with a box truck who could meet me in an hour. I must have looked like a crazy person standing on the street corner with this wild looking metal and wood cabinet.  We got the cabinet home and I just stuck the thing in my living room for a year.  I lived with it thinking about whether or not to find someone to refinish it and replace the missing burl panels. Then one day I was browsing through a vintage furniture store and I spotted this chandelier on the ceiling. I knew what it was because I had seen this Lightolier advertisement from the early 1950s of the same chandelier from a different model year and I also already owned this Lightolier chandelier from the same line. I asked the store owners if it would be easier for them to sell a Paul Evans cabinet than a chandelier and I proposed the trade. They agreed and a few days later showed up at my place with a truck and the neatly wrapped chandelier!"
Mid_Century,2or4dy,UncleAtom,4,Tue Dec 9 13:48:43 2014 UTC,"Great story and even better outcome for something that could have been destroyed.  I've never seen that chandelier, but you're right - it's amazing!"
Mid_Century,2or4dy,F-That,3,Tue Dec 9 15:26:59 2014 UTC,That is awesome. The light fixture is amazing and I think you made a good trade. the time and money to refurbish the credenza would have been a pain in the ass and you get instant gratification from the light. Very nice and thanks for telling the story. I get excited like that when I find pieces and start acting crazy until I have them in my home in safe keeping. Its always a crap shoot until it is actually in your possession nice and warm in your place.
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,brass_and_rosewood,3,Tue Dec 9 04:26:58 2014 UTC,Obviously 1stDibs pricing is a little wacky and mine is teak rather than rosewood but here is a listing for the rosewood version of this table on 1stDibs.
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,theredwhiner,4,Tue Dec 9 04:31:34 2014 UTC,"May I just say, holy shite?"
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,mullacc,2,Tue Dec 9 04:33:14 2014 UTC,"I know, right!"
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,asad137,3,Tue Dec 9 04:35:05 2014 UTC,"Obviously 1stDibs pricing is a little wacky   The same seller has a single Finn Juhl NV45 chair on sale for $68k. There is a pair in the upcoming Wright auction with an estimate of $15-20k. The pair is teak while the 1st dibs one is rosewood.  But here's a rosewood NV45 that recently sold for $20k (above the estimated range tho).  Not like there's any need to prove that dealers overprice stuff on 1st dibs, but I always find it interesting.  On the other hand, that infamous $600k Chieftain chair went for almost seven times the midpoint of the estimated range."
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,cseyferth,2,Tue Dec 9 14:39:37 2014 UTC,How much did you pay for yours?
Mid_Century,2oq0rl,missfittnc,3,Tue Dec 9 14:46:46 2014 UTC,"Beautiful, but those legs seem like it would be difficult to sit at."
Mid_Century,2one1y,brass_and_rosewood,4,Mon Dec 8 14:50:26 2014 UTC,I usually don't pay much for the pieces I collect because I keep looking until I find the pieces I want for cheap but I paid good money for this chair because it is so rare that you can't find this model with a Google image search. There are others from the Symmetric collection online but not this wingback version.
Mid_Century,2one1y,iamlowsound,3,Mon Dec 8 14:53:29 2014 UTC,I want that chair!
Mid_Century,2one1y,theredwhiner,3,Mon Dec 8 15:26:53 2014 UTC,I want to have a drink on that chair.
Mid_Century,2one1y,mullacc,3,Tue Dec 9 04:24:10 2014 UTC,"Awesome. Is the upholstery original?  Are you a fan of McCobb in general? One of my first MCM purchases from a ""collector"" POV was a set of Planner Group chairs, which I still love. But in the short time I've been paying attention I've already become over-exposed to Planner Group stuff and soured on it mostly. Especially that damn desk."
Mid_Century,2one1y,mullacc,3,Mon Dec 8 15:44:30 2014 UTC,"Oh, I love that Planner Group desk. It is so 1940s-50s. It reminds be a lot of George Nakashima's two leg desks and Edmund Spence's desk. For me the Planner Group style is classic American 1950s design. It's good design and so definitively American. The other nice thing about that line is that all of it is solid wood. None of those pieces are veneer. So in 100 years they will still be here and can be easily refinished without sanding through the veneer layer."
Mid_Century,2one1y,Flat_corp,3,Mon Dec 8 16:29:11 2014 UTC,"The asymmetry of the McCobb desk spoils it for me. Assuming this is the Edmund Spence desk you mean, it definitely has a similar look but I think it's a much better design."
Mid_Century,2one1y,mullacc,3,Mon Dec 8 16:48:36 2014 UTC,Wow that Edmund Spence desk is gorgeous.
Mid_Century,2one1y,Altarocks,2,Tue Dec 9 02:27:33 2014 UTC,Do you own the Planner Group desk or do have you soured on it because you come across them so often? If you come across them often for $400 or under  you should buy them. Where I live people pay $700-$1000 easy for those desks.
Mid_Century,2one1y,Woolio,3,Mon Dec 8 18:54:22 2014 UTC,"I'm in Chicago and see them on craigslists and vintage stores a lot. But not for cheap. Your $700-1000 estimate seems about right. And maybe twice that if it's a nice one with a chair. Well, at least the asking price will be that high.  If one landed on my lap for <$400 I'd certainly buy it. But I'm not out there looking hard for this stuff. Guess I'm more of a retail customer at the end of the day."
Mid_Century,2one1y,witchsbrew,2,Mon Dec 8 19:20:50 2014 UTC,I'm not sure if the upholstery is original.
Mid_Century,2om5qi,brass_and_rosewood,7,Mon Dec 8 04:17:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to redirect this sub back to its nobler origin. I appreciate your posts and hope to contribute with content of my own, as I progress through my own journey and acquisition of new pieces."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,vincent_vancough,4,Mon Dec 8 05:04:19 2014 UTC,"For me collecting mid century modern design is not about kitschy campy stuff from 50 years ago  While I 100% agree with this, it's probably futile. Especially with Mid_Century as the subreddit name. I wish it were ""Modernist Design"" or something like that."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,mullacc,3,Mon Dec 8 06:10:20 2014 UTC,"To be fair, those posts aren't really the brunt of the content here. It's few and far between. If we can keep it that way, we should be able to maintain our identity.   I think we might want to make our focus more present moving forward, though."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,Woolio,1 point,Mon Dec 8 09:00:32 2014 UTC,"The sub has always had those posts and I don't know if I can change that. Yes, that kind of post isn't the majority of the content but it does happen often enough that I wanted to point it out."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,thetraffic,4,Mon Dec 8 13:17:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the input bandr, I have been reading your post for awhile and you definitely know your stuff. I am just starting and have some of the high end stuff from knoll, stiffel and others but find most of it too delicate for daily use. My favorites tend to be my leather covered Krueger eames bar stools an elephant could sit on and my five piece Kent Coffey ""Impact"" bedroom set. I think some of the American mass producers got it right keeping the lines while increasing the durability."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,jonesey1955,3,Mon Dec 8 19:24:26 2014 UTC,"Anybody can start their own, ""modernist design"" subreddit. This is mid century, and I think the majority of the things pointed out as bad in the guide actually belong here. There are other reasons besides ""good design"" to have this stuff. Yes, certainly there is a line to be drawn somewhere, but this isn't it."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,mullacc,2,Mon Dec 8 12:30:55 2014 UTC,"Anybody can start their own, ""modernist design"" subreddit. This is mid century...   Isn't Mid_Century just short for ""mid century modernist design""? If it's not and it's just about things that appeared in the mid-20th century, then the description of the subreddit is incorrect."

Mid_Century,2om5qi,riomx,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:11:42 2014 UTC,"You are right, everything I pointed out as a bad piece or a bad design choice in the guide from last year is definitely ""mid century"" but those pieces are really the bottom of the barrel mid century pieces. So whether or not they belong here (or in your home) is what I am giving my opinion on. If you look on LiveAuctioneers.com and search for some of the mid century auctions you'll notice that everything I pointed out as bad is missing from those auctions. Serious auction houses won't sell step up side tables or laminate topped credenzas because serious collectors don't buy that stuff."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,mullacc,4,Mon Dec 8 13:28:39 2014 UTC,"But I wasn't even referring to the step up side tables (which I have a bone to pick with you about). The links to ""bad"" posts you discussed this time were a milk cup and batteries. If there's a line, as /u/jonesey1955 phrased it, and those are on the acceptable side of it, then what use is the line?"
Mid_Century,2om5qi,riomx,4,Mon Dec 8 13:47:15 2014 UTC,"Camp and kitsch are not what belongs here, but sometimes things slip through the cracks.   However, as I've mentioned time and time again, I do not want this sub to become unwelcome for people who cannot afford high end 20th century design pieces.  It's not a realistic assumption that high end design is universally affordable right now, especially in urban areas like mine where it is in exaggeratedly high demand.   This is the reason you don't see many of those posts -- it's unrealistic to expect people to only seek those items out, because their availability is dependent on geographical distribution when they were new, popularity in styles at the time, and their present demand and availability today.  There are some pickers that do this for a living and sometimes post their hauls of all the things they found and are going to mark up several times over when they sell, but those are few and far between.  This sub needs to remain a welcome place for people learning and serious collectors alike. Or as others have suggested, a high end design sub can be created any time by people willing to invest the time to contribute and actively moderate it."
Mid_Century,2om5qi,jonesey1955,3,Mon Dec 8 15:21:21 2014 UTC,"I hear you about making the sub welcoming. And it's easy enough to ignore posts that don't appeal to me.  However, I do think there's a middle ground between high end design and kitsch. Like, I don't mind at all when someone posts a picture of some junky furniture they found and basically just ask ""is this a thing?"" But posts like the battery one seem to really stick out--yes they are easy enough to ignore, but also easy enough to delete. Would that kind of post normally be deleted or are you actually saying it's acceptable (albeit undesirable)?"

Mid_Century,2o6u3y,riomx,2,Thu Dec 4 23:52:06 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, sadly this isn't the same. The legs are different and I believe the hole in the back was smaller. This is one of the closest matches though. If my agency didn't have an active enforcement case with the plant where the chair is located I would just call them, I'm afraid that isn't an option in the foreseeable future.

The base is missing as you noted, but the lamp was working properly. The long rounded housing is either missing pieces or broken, one of the shells was loose and wouldn't stay on."
Mid_Century,2nyz1v,ArkJasdain,3,Tue Dec 2 16:55:16 2014 UTC,"Gray one is a Dazor floating arm something or other. Great quality pieces. I'm a watchmaker by trade, Dazor lamps (two and three bulb florescent like this) are exceedingly common to find as the default lamp choice of workbench lighting. They have good coverage, and the floating arm system moves easily to wherever you want it and stays in place. They also last forever, the school I went to had Dazors from the 60s and I've seen pictures from factories in the early 50s and before with the same model lamps in use.  I have one clamped onto my personal workbench right now."
Mid_Century,2nyz1v,ArkJasdain,2,Tue Dec 2 07:07:59 2014 UTC,The fact that the design looks the same after half a century suggests that they're doing something right! Have you purchased any recently (trying to get a feel for prices)?
Mid_Century,2nyz1v,ultraguardrail,3,Tue Dec 2 16:52:56 2014 UTC,"None recently purchased. I know new they're at least a couple hundred dollars. They're on ebay all the time between $40 and $100 in various conditions, you shouldn't struggle to find one for about $50 or $75 which is nice and clean and working well. I got mine in an antique store for $17.95 and it just needed a cleaning.  There's also a myriad of mounts and bases available for the Dazor, everything from weighted desk bases to screw down or clamp down bases, in addition there are a few versions of wheeled floor bases originally used in doctor and dentist offices."
Mid_Century,2nyz1v,riceandrain,3,Tue Dec 2 19:02:25 2014 UTC,The white one looks like one of my luxo's.

But the style was still cool, even if it was a non-functioning sideboard, and for how much these are going for currently, the price ain't half bad.  When I got it home, cleaned it up, and plugged it in, I was so psyched. Literally EVERYTHING works like new. The phonograph rejects and auto plays, the radio tunes very precisely, and all of the speakers work perfectly on both sides. And the sub-woofers mean serious business. The back has ports for a tape deck, so I can even hook my iPod up to it for parties. Great success!"

I'm still not clear who made these,  but I did find another similar one on their Etsy store with a somewhat different configuration, and what looks like  a matching credenza (ad says Borge Mogensen).

I use Twitter to talk to our Ikea store and they're very good about answering if/when/where stuff is on display.  The person who manages the Ikea Portland account is so good in fact that I first asked about the Ekenaset sofa a few months back they said they didn't have plans to carry it in the US. Then when it came in stock they remembered me and shot me a msg saying it was in stock and would be on display soon.  The thing to note is that this doesn't seem to be a single collection and just an assortment of products that will be sold once again."

Mid_Century,2mtspd,peter_fuckin_gabriel,6,Thu Nov 20 00:42:05 2014 UTC,I have a feeling it's a contemporary rather than vintage desk. Rounded edges were popular in the 90s. The legs are also a bit strange.
Mid_Century,2mtspd,riomx,3,Thu Nov 20 14:03:34 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way about the legs, but not enough to get me from passing it up.  - You may be right about the time period.  - I'll post more pix when I get it home."
Mid_Century,2mtspd,riomx,4,Thu Nov 20 14:52:31 2014 UTC,"Strange wasn't the right word - just unusual for that style of desk. Either way though, it looks like a nice desk."
Mid_Century,2mtspd,joelav,5,Thu Nov 20 17:23:17 2014 UTC,"As a furniture maker, that looks like it was made by an amateur (recently) for a few reasons:  1 - the legs. They are very ""unfinished"". Sometimes that is ok and intentional, but it contrasts with the heavy roundover on the top. Also the ""feet"" are just kind of attached to the leg vertical supports. A manufacturer or higher skilled furniture maker/designer would have used some kind of joinery.   And probably cut away some material from the base. You want as little floor contact as necessary because floors are rarely even.  Also it appears to be dimensional 3/4"" lumber. Rarely seen in furniture with that design. Usually it's a lot more stout (especially the verticals)  2 - If that really is redwood - it's brand new or recently refinished. Redwood is very soft. You could easily scratch it with your fingernail  3 - The drawer boxes. They look to be stained the same color as the top, but also appear to be a different species.   Also for a pro furniture builder, the grain is running the wrong way (It would likely be vertical, and slip matched)  Again the material thickness on the drawer boxes looks like nominal plywood you would get at a home improvement store.  All that is not to say this isn't a good piece. Even if this were constructed of home depot materials, 150 is a very fair price. But I don't think it's vintage"
Mid_Century,2mtspd,joelav,3,Thu Nov 20 20:58:05 2014 UTC,"Bummer - In the second photo, you can see he has a large piece of Plexiglas for the top.  He must have added that because redwood is so soft.  Either way, I needed a desk.  As long as I can recover what I paid, I feel like I'm in good shape.    Thanks for the info.. really informative.  Do you need an apprentice?"
Mid_Century,2mtspd,joelav,3,Thu Nov 20 21:25:00 2014 UTC,"Even if that desk was made in someones basement it would still easily be worth 350 to 400. If you are looking for a good solid desk, you got one. If you were looking for a possible antiques roadshow goldmine, you may have to wait 150 years or so :)"
Mid_Century,2mtspd,ronisolomondds,2,Thu Nov 20 21:30:49 2014 UTC,"Since you're a furniture maker, I'll ask it.  Hypothetically, are those legs replaceable?  Could I replace those things with something a little more proper for the type of desk it is?"
Mid_Century,2mscre,didnotwanttoregister,15,Wed Nov 19 17:24:10 2014 UTC,Great find!  I actually enjoyed the old cushions.
Mid_Century,2mscre,pogoing,7,Wed Nov 19 18:47:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, those old cushions were dope"
Mid_Century,2mscre,lobster_johnson,4,Wed Nov 19 19:31:28 2014 UTC,"It's hard to tell from the pic, but there was a lot of wear as well as staining."
Mid_Century,2mscre,lobster_johnson,2,Wed Nov 19 21:49:58 2014 UTC,"Alright, now I am just bragging, but I picked this chair up for 15 dollars from a farmer who didn't realize what he had. It's in decent shape, a few blemishes here and there, but pretty good overall.  The cushions were hideous, so I recovered them. Otherwise, I haven't done any work on it."
Mid_Century,2mscre,brass_and_rosewood,8,Wed Nov 19 17:25:46 2014 UTC,"Perhaps the old cushions weren't in great shape, but they suited the chair; the slightly off-white color against dark wood is a great contrast:  http://www.mid-century-modern-interiors.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Kennedy_Chair_520x520.jpg  Light gray is also a great choice:  https://img1.etsystatic.com/039/1/8040395/il_340x270.627363109_4ylk.jpg  For me, that asymmetrical red stripe is destroys the elegant, symmetrical minimalism of the chair's design. It's a chair, not a race car."
Mid_Century,2mscre,brass_and_rosewood,3,Wed Nov 19 20:10:26 2014 UTC,"Hmm, that a good point. I added the stripe, because the room has a lack of color. But, I really like the look of those light grey cushions.  I plan on making new cushions (this was my first time every making them and they aren't perfect), so I might try that."
Mid_Century,2mscre,rodface,5,Wed Nov 19 21:52:06 2014 UTC,"Lack of colour can be addressed with a lot of things, like rugs and plants, or paintings. You get colour by complementing pieces. For example, a white chair can have a blue pillow:  http://i.imgur.com/QxvXlc9.jpg  Colours don't need to stand out; subtlety is often better than high contrast. The important thing is that they don't compete with each other visually; primary colours (red and blue, for example) tend to do that, for example. Here's a muted approach that combines red with ""earthy"" colours of brown, light beige, and wood:  http://i.imgur.com/7GnbIYl.jpg  A more planned, rigorous colour scheme uses a few core colours (teal, gray, blue and a consistent use of pale wood like birch or oak):  http://i.imgur.com/qrEG9MO.jpg  That last look is harder to get right without looking too planned and awkward."
Mid_Century,2mscre,awd3495,2,Wed Nov 19 23:33:08 2014 UTC,Good find. Great price! Is it marked at all? What do the straps and back bars look like? Can you post photos?
Mid_Century,2mscre,qwerqwert,2,Wed Nov 19 17:57:29 2014 UTC,"Not stamped, but the straps and back bars are in decent shape. Not great, but not bad."
Mid_Century,2mscre,ThriftShopKnickers,2,Wed Nov 19 21:52:51 2014 UTC,It might be possible for me to figure out the maker if I see those parts.

Mid_Century,2mqxkv,jackola,2,Wed Nov 19 06:10:01 2014 UTC,"On electrical, I would just upgrade to new. whats your budget? Are you doing all of them in the house?"
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,F-That,2,Wed Nov 19 15:21:21 2014 UTC,Not sure on cost but it's relatively inexpensive. We'll do the work ourselves and plan to replace everything with new.   I guess I'm trying to find out if there's a certain style we should use to maintain the MCM look.
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,F-That,2,Wed Nov 19 15:55:00 2014 UTC,"Ivory toggle switch and ivory wall plates. Or light almond. You cant go wrong with that. If you have it in your budget, you can always get the stainless steel plates.   If it was me though and I was going through all that work, I would replace them with something that is more modern than mid century. Wall switches don't catch anyone's eye, or are there to impress unless you make it that way. There are a lot of cool new styles out now. I have some pretty fun switches and people always comment on them. Its kind of cool."
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,raanne,2,Wed Nov 19 16:17:15 2014 UTC,"FYI, if you bypass the ""decorative"" stainless steel (IE, fancy packaging) you can get the stainless steel commercial / industrial plates for much cheaper. They are located by the general electrical stock usually."
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,bucknuggets,2,Thu Nov 20 14:16:38 2014 UTC,I've heard from friends that new switches don't last as long as those made decades ago - that failures after 5-7 years are not uncommon.  Know anything about that?  Because I would upgrade to new but suspect that upgrading to old might result in better reliability.
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,F-That,3,Fri Nov 21 14:43:53 2014 UTC,There is nothing complicated in a switch. They last forever unless you get fancy Radio Frequancy switches or motion detectors. The fail rate on switches is tiny.
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,bucknuggets,2,Sat Nov 22 00:14:36 2014 UTC,That was my assumption.  Perhaps my friends had purchased the cheapest stuff homedepot or walmart offered and got the appropriate quality.
Mid_Century,2mqxkv,rodface,2,Sat Nov 22 05:03:05 2014 UTC,"I think a metallic finish goes well with the style, whether silver (my preference) or gold. I got some similar to these at Lowe's for about $4.00 per outlet/switch."
Mid_Century,2moluy,Timoboll,5,Tue Nov 18 17:48:22 2014 UTC,"I got it off of craigslist for $25, I will take better pictures when I get home."
Mid_Century,2moluy,F-That,3,Tue Nov 18 18:02:27 2014 UTC,I like it. Love me some slat tables. I would have snagged it also.
Mid_Century,2moluy,Tweeted,5,Tue Nov 18 18:14:44 2014 UTC,Nice purchase for $25.  Would work great as a bench or coffee table.
Mid_Century,2moluy,brass_and_rosewood,3,Tue Nov 18 19:12:45 2014 UTC,$25 is a great price. It might be a bench but could definitely double as a coffee table. There are a lot of these floating around. I believe that they are American made and they are loosely based on the bench by George Nelson mixed with Danish style legs.

Mid_Century,2moluy,riomx,2,Tue Nov 18 18:19:13 2014 UTC,The first and third link look almost exactly the same as mine aside from the color. I'm thinking of sanding and staining it to a darker color like the 3rd image.
Mid_Century,2moluy,rodface,5,Tue Nov 18 18:33:14 2014 UTC,Be careful and don't sand too far. watch some good video's on how to do it right.
Mid_Century,2moluy,awd3495,3,Tue Nov 18 18:57:10 2014 UTC,They're probably the same or similar colors. It's just that under different lighting stains can appear lighter or darker. The photo you posted was taken in the sun. That always makes wood furniture appear lighter.

Mid_Century,2moluy,Toppo,2,Wed Nov 19 22:25:03 2014 UTC,Nice. Pretty much a staple of MCM furniture I think (not this one specifically but any slat bench).   I tend to think of and use mine as a bench rather than a table.
Mid_Century,2moou0,cynicallad,11,Tue Nov 18 18:12:43 2014 UTC,Maybe it's literally mid-century (though I think it's probably from the 70s?) but it's definitely not what someone who likes 'mid century modern design' would mean when they use that term.
Mid_Century,2moou0,mullacc,4,Tue Nov 18 18:48:07 2014 UTC,"That's an ""antique TV stand."" Put your real TV on it.  Alternatively, turn it into a fishtank and BAM! Instant Pinterest DIY celebrity."

Mid_Century,2mla33,Emerone,2,Tue Nov 18 17:25:06 2014 UTC,No idea if sustainable. It is local though. I also know that a lot of the large cypress slabs from around here are just logs collected from the swamps that have already fallen.

Mid_Century,2ml8fx,ihminen,2,Mon Nov 17 22:27:05 2014 UTC,I'm open to suggestions. What would you do that respects the piece and also makes the top usable?
Mid_Century,2ml8fx,ihminen,3,Mon Nov 17 22:28:45 2014 UTC,"What about a clear, durable finish, like polycrylic or varnish? I've seen, but never used, Krylon's outdoor/indoor clear coat spray.   All of my wood furnishings have been good with a nice coat of Howard Feed N Wax, so I don't have any experience refinishing, but a clear finish would maintain the point of having wood while allowing you to use it as a ""modern"" kitchen table where we never worry about heat and moisture on those surfaces."
Mid_Century,2ml8fx,ihminen,2,Mon Nov 17 22:46:22 2014 UTC,"That's a good idea, but the top is really chewed up. I don't want to preserve something hideous."
Mid_Century,2ml8fx,ihminen,2,Mon Nov 17 23:36:25 2014 UTC,"So to be clear, you're talking about the smaller surface, not the expanded surface. Depending on the veneer depth, it might still be possible to sand and refinish."
Mid_Century,2ml8fx,ihminen,2,Mon Nov 17 23:41:28 2014 UTC,The problem is there isn't much of the original veneer left.

Mid_Century,2ml8fx,Hodaka,3,Tue Nov 18 03:31:20 2014 UTC,Call me crazy but I really like the idea of giving the top surface a high gloss white enamel finish. I'm not sure its a piece totally worth the time and money for a full restoration. And if you've never done something like that before it might not turn out as well. I think white would be a great update to a simple piece.

For two pounds of the Denmark weave, however, it was $30 and there was not enough string for the chair. Yes, I am doing it myself. I found a helpful guide using the same chair as an example."
Mid_Century,2mizr7,kerklein2,3,Mon Nov 17 04:31:35 2014 UTC,"Let me know how it goes, it looks like terrible tedious work and not fun at all. I've got a couple new Moller 78s, and have considered buying a couple more used and restoring them to have 4, but been scared by the weaving."

Mid_Century,2mir4p,mattseg,4,Mon Nov 17 02:16:50 2014 UTC,"I owe it to my parents.  They were newlyweds, new parents, and new homeowners in the early Sixties.  I don't know if they sought out mid-century furniture specifically or if they just bought what was available at the time, but our house had some typical mid-level mid century furnishings... sofa, three-shade pole lamp, laminate coffee table, and a gorgeous teak and frosted glass lamp in the entry.    By the time I was grown and ready to move out their furniture was less mid-century and more contemporary 70's, heavy on floral prints.    I didn't buy or collect much mid-century stuff until recently, although I suppose it started with a Mastercrafters Model 47 Flying Cloud clock I got many years ago.    A few years ago I bought a 1963 mid-century house with an Eichler-like roofline.  My wife and I have been slowly returning the house to its original appearance.  It has a fun and funky original 60's wood-paneled basement, and on the main floor the original cherrywood built-in light fixtures survived several remodels.    Since moving in we've purchased several authentic mid-century pieces to furnish our home but we have a long way to go.  Here's a pic of our living room right now.  Here's a photo sequence of the bathroom remodel that restored the master bathroom to its original configuration.  I don't have any photos of the 'before' state but trust me, it was a country-fried oak-and-brass horror from a previous owner's remodel.    We've since redone the master bedroom:  Painted, upgraded the lighting, and replaced the worn out sliding closet doors with period-correct bifold doors; and we pulled up all the wall-to-wall carpeting on the main floor to reveal beautiful maple hardwood floors.  Early next year we will have the hardwood refinished.  I will post pictures soon..."
Mid_Century,2mir4p,Dr_Adequate,2,Mon Nov 17 05:35:54 2014 UTC,My story is pretty damn close to yours. Purchased a 1962 home that needed some serious updating and have gutted it room by room. Our style is pretty modern but we love the more modern mid century elements so it makes for a good mix. I need to make an album of my upgrades but I still have more rooms to go before I feel like its worth showing off.
Mid_Century,2mir4p,F-That,2,Tue Nov 18 22:25:18 2014 UTC,Who are your double-seat couches (not sure what to call them) by?
Mid_Century,2mir4p,rodface,3,Wed Nov 19 18:48:31 2014 UTC,No idea- there was no maker's mark that I found. A friend thinks they could be Dux as they are the correct style and color.
Mid_Century,2mir4p,Dr_Adequate,3,Wed Nov 19 20:05:40 2014 UTC,"For me, my first MCM piece ( later end of it all) was an Uten Silo that my aunt had.  I thought it was cool and useful, and she gave it to me. This was about 12 years ago, and I had no idea it was something 'special' until about 4 years later I saw a repop in esquire magazine for $400 and it surprised me.  I guess I gravitated toward the simple and clean aesthetic ever since.    Here is mine, albeit not super clean right now http://imgur.com/MPzej1K"

Mid_Century,2mir4p,fat_al142,3,Fri Nov 21 22:12:45 2014 UTC,"My grandparents.  I was always close with my grandparents, and spent a lot of time in their house. When they moved from their old place (a 60's ranch), they brought with them a Drexel Declaration set and I was fascinated with it. The clean lines; the porcelain drawer-pulls. I never realized the significance of the brand/collection until I started researching mid-century furniture.   My grandmother has promised me the set now that she's too old to care for it, but I have to find a good way of moving it!"
Mid_Century,2mir4p,mullacc,3,Mon Nov 17 18:15:40 2014 UTC,"Drexel Declaration   I really love the Declaration line. This highboy has been for sale for quite a while in the Chicago area (well, I think it is still for sale). Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of the top door, which I think is unique to this piece. This version I love."
Mid_Century,2mir4p,fat_al142,2,Wed Nov 19 23:16:00 2014 UTC,"This version I love   Absolutely stunning. My grandparents owned the same set, and my grandfather still used his Declaration pieces up until the day he passed. They even had glass custom cut to fit the top of the pieces to protect the wood.  I'm hoping that I can give them a new home in the near future."
Mid_Century,2mir4p,newredditcauseangela,3,Thu Nov 20 14:09:53 2014 UTC,I didn't know what MCM was. Saw these on ebay. Fell in love.  http://www.strictlyheywake.com/images/images/3081.jpg  Mine are refinished and not nearly as nice but I still love them. I bought them when a few hundred dollars was an absolute fortune for me. The first non-ikea furniture I ever purchased. I have a bigger budget and some more expensive pieces now but they are still favorites.  Once I knew what mcm was I realized that one of my uncles homes was filled with amazing pieces. I chalked it up to the fact that he was a successful well off designer which he is. Only this year did I find out he used to work at Knoll and actually knew many of the folks that made those pieces.

Mid_Century,2mir4p,mullacc,3,Wed Nov 19 04:48:36 2014 UTC,"Our first was a Ward six-drawer dresser from Goodwill. I didn't really have an eye for MCM or furniture at the time, but my girlfriend thankfully convinced me that we had to have it. It's by no means our nicest piece, and its condition is nowhere near that of the one in the image, but it's definitely one of my favorites."

Mid_Century,2mhwjf,zim2411,3,Mon Nov 17 00:01:15 2014 UTC,Sweet. The Andre is three cushions too. The single cushion looks great in the picture but I bet it wears weird.
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,mullacc,2,Mon Nov 17 00:28:43 2014 UTC,"Nice room! very clean. Also love the picture arrangement above the couch.   Speaking of which, where did you get that sofa? It's very nice."
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,zim2411,2,Mon Nov 17 18:21:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks! My sister did the picture arrangement. The sofa is an original George Nelson from the 50s or 60s purchased from Home Anthology. We think it was reupholstered in the 80s or 90s, not sure. When I got it the back cushions were dryrotted and had the texture of stale bread. (As in very stiff at first, but if you press hard enough it crumbles) My mother reupholsters furniture and offered to replace the foam as a Christmas present last year. (Picture is shortly after I got everything setup, which is why I have a tiny Christmas tree + presents in the back corner) The fabric is still in very good condition, and I'm hoping to get another 10-20 years of use out of it before I need to redo it."
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,Shakes8993,3,Mon Nov 17 19:21:00 2014 UTC,The Andre. Looks very nice
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,mirthquake,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:57:28 2014 UTC,"Yup. It's sexy, simple, great color, and legs look wooden and sturdy. Wood makes it jump right out from the gallery of chrome-legged sofas, which are beautiful but don't say ""comfort and wamrth"" to me even though the metal's on the underside.   Being farmiliar with some Room and Board pieces, I suspect that those seat and seatback cushions are nice and cushy. Cushier than some other brands that replicate that type of low-and-tight-as-possible upholsetry that designers like Pearsall used on slender sofas and is now replicated widely. Nice look, not as comfy as possible. That Andre looks like you could sink into it."
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,ayhsmb,2,Tue Nov 25 05:15:20 2014 UTC,"The room & board link seems to be the most trustworthy looking link. I used to own a couch from A&G Merch, the ""brooklyn heights"" i believe. It was extremely well-made and upholstered with high quality fabric. I live in brooklyn though so we picked it up to avoid the delivery fees and it worked out to like $1600 for a damn fine couch."
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,TentheDog,2,Mon Nov 17 00:00:23 2014 UTC,"So, I went through this exact process about 4 months ago. I even got swatches from Rove and IFN.  At the end of the day, I figured a knock-off wasn't worth it, because there was too much iffy-ness about production quality and materials. So, I went looking for something similar, but in its own right was well-designed.  I ended up getting the Spencer sofa from Gus Modern: http://gusmodern.com/products/spencer-sofa  It is two long cushions instead of six individual ones, and it is a bit shorter (84""), but it is a sharp sofa. I could take or leave the bolsters. It isn't a pillowy, fat, comfy couch. It is a bit stiff, but I wanted that cleaner lined, more structured look. I've really liked it."
Mid_Century,2mhwjf,newredditcauseangela,2,Mon Nov 17 02:23:01 2014 UTC,"I've found a lot of room and board couches and chairs to be weirdly stuffed and uncomfortable but that's just my experience. I have a younger and like it but not that model, the Lily. Which of these brands do you have the ability to go see and actually sit in? I never purchase a piece of furniture that I haven't tried. You're the one who is going to have to sit in it everyday. I'd try as many as you can and pick the one you feel is most comfortable. They are all attractive."

Mid_Century,2mhwjf,strong_grey_hero,3,Mon Nov 17 05:45:20 2014 UTC,Ive been unimpressed with IKEA quality so far. I'd rather pay more up front and get something that I feel will last a little longer
Mid_Century,2mf9dl,Hasselbuddy,9,Sun Nov 16 00:12:42 2014 UTC,Interesting because one of the design premises of McDonalds for a long time was to have uncomfortable seating so that patrons wouldn't linger after eating. (This was to prevent them from becoming an unprofitable youth loitering spot.)
Mid_Century,2mf9dl,Syllogism19,3,Sun Nov 16 02:02:38 2014 UTC,"Has this been proven? I don't fully doubt it, but having never found the seating uncomfortable while growing up, I figured it was myth."

The second floor dining room has some Le Corbusier LC2s and maybe some Barcelona chairs?  But the coolest stuff was along the back where the McDonald's ""museum"" exhibits are. They had a whole array of significant modern chairs...Eames, Saarinen, Noguchi, a Volther Corona Chair, etc. Unfortunately, the last time I went most of them were gone.  I think maybe people don't realize how much commercial business Herman Miller and Knoll do. Another good example is Herman Miller's Eames airport seating."

In 2012, it was given a permanent place in Designmuseum, Denmark, the largest museum of design in Scandinavia. It became a cult object for design lovers around the globe with its calm contemporary elegance and a feeling of floating.

At first glance, I was certain that I had picked up Yngve EkstrÃ¶m's FT08 for Pastoe. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the arms are totally different (solid, carved wood; all one piece) and the head rest was much more conservative.

The living area is a wood laminate.   Edit: I added a current picture in another comment. Eventually that space will probably be a formal living and dining area and the TV will be moved to the second living room, however, the second living room doesn't currently have central heating and air (it was an addition in '56), and that is low on my priority list.

Mid_Century,2m5ojn,jfk_sfa,3,Thu Nov 13 16:33:00 2014 UTC,"I like the part where the two top voted comments are one saying it is priced too high, and the other saying it is priced too low."
Mid_Century,2m5ojn,3wayhandshake,3,Thu Nov 13 17:44:00 2014 UTC,"I would say that's more modern or contemporary than MCM.  You should do your research into leathers before buying a leather couch though,  make sure it's not bonded leather, which is like the particle board of leather.  This seems a bit cheap for a leather couch this large, so I'd be worried about quality."
Mid_Century,2m5ojn,atanincrediblerate,2,Thu Nov 13 13:01:59 2014 UTC,"Yes I know about leather, that's why I was asking here for the style, because I don't plan to buy from thrive, as stated in the title..."

I don't know if this means much but I do associate YLiving with the higher end brands they sell--Herman Miller, Knoll, Vitra, Kartell, etc. Not that True Modern is comparable to those brands, but YLiving must have done due diligence before deciding to carry the brand."

But tripod legged-chairs aren't very stable.  Didn't work at all with kids."
Mid_Century,2lx0ub,bucknuggets,3,Tue Nov 11 14:24:02 2014 UTC,That's not a joybird table. Joybird makes one with weird tripod legs. http://joybird.com/dining-sets/toscano-dining-set  Am I wrong? I like the idea but not the tripod chairs.   Edit: I got an email from Joybird introducing these chairs. I suspect they're compatible with their existing Toscano dining table. These new four-leg chairs are not yet on their website but I imagine they will be soon.

Mid_Century,2lv431,F-That,2,Mon Nov 10 15:13:58 2014 UTC,Early Friday I got an alert about a Danish modern piece for sale and got in contact with the owner as soon as possible. Made arrangements to go pick up this piece on Saturday morning and could not have been happier. The couple selling it was retired and just moved into my area. They purchased this new when they lived in Germany many years ago and it has sense then been all over the united states. The home they purchased was too small for all their furniture so they had to let this one go. I also don't have enough room for it so it will be going to my Mother-in-law's place to enjoy for now.   http://i.imgur.com/JTcqSeL.jpg

My chairs are identical (also could use re-upholstery) and I think were made in Singapore.  I was told in that era Danish manufacturers did that fairly often?  Wish I could remember the marking on the table itself, I'll look tonight and let you know.  I'd bet its the same manufacturer as what you have.  I like mine, not too crazy MCM but can go with many different tastes.  Good find."

I saw this exact piece on their Facebook page, inquired, got a reply, then nothing. But one of my close friends saw it days after at the estate sale and bought it. She didn't know I was inquiring. So, months later, after always sitting and bantering with the estate guys when we saw them at restaurants, they told me they had another. And we promptly went to get it.

You should use this as a learning piece and sand the top surface. 100- grit to start, then finish with a 300-grit. Stain it to match the bottom, then apply your finish, such as poly or tung oil. (I'd use poly for this piece because tung is $$$.) You might also consider using some wood filler in that top split. You can sand it once it dries.  I don't think it's MC, but it's still worth saving if you like it. The wood plugs you mention are simply there to disguise screws that are inset. You can pop them out with something sharp, but be careful. You can buy replacements at Home Depot or Lowe's, I think, but you'll have to stain them to match. Good luck!"

Mid_Century,2lio3s,DFWPhotoguy,10,Thu Nov 6 22:09:35 2014 UTC,"My wife saw this in the back of the auction house when we were walking around and said we needed this. I agreed. Optical Art, especially early optical art is pretty to look at, collectible and something we didnât have. So I threw a 90 dollar bid online and ended up winning.   We knew it was an artist serigraph because it is numbered but werenât sure who it belonged to. About 8 seconds later my wife had found that it was more than likely an early print by Richard Anuszkiewicz in the Inward Eye collection.   The print itself is in perfect shape, the frame and glass are dirty but thatâs an easy fix.   http://www.swope.org/past/the-inward-eye-richard-anuszkiewicz-and-william-blake/  http://www.op-art.co.uk/richard-anuszkiewicz/  http://rogallery.com/Anuszkiewicz_Richard/w-312/anuszkiewicz-inward-eye-9.htm"

Mid_Century,2lk5ju,kittycatcate,3,Fri Nov 7 14:41:04 2014 UTC,Agreed.  They are beautiful and the upholstery looks pretty decent-- great find.
Mid_Century,2lk5ju,weenur,2,Fri Nov 7 20:08:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks. They are actually really comfortable and I figured I couldn't go too far wrong for 25 bucks. I always find myself wishing for more content on this sub, so I felt like I needed to post them and am hoping someone here might know more about them."
Mid_Century,2lk5ju,PlasticSpoon,7,Fri Nov 7 21:53:58 2014 UTC,"So, I picked these up at the local Salvation Army. They were asking $14.99 each, but the manager said if I took both, she would give them to me for $24.99 total. They're a little beat up, but I thought they were too cool to pass up at that price. I've found two listings on 1stdibs that list them as Adrian Pearsall, but I was hoping someone here might be able to confirm one way or the other. Here is a pic of the legs: http://imgur.com/Px74BQg"
Mid_Century,2lk5ju,PrimaryNumbers,2,Fri Nov 7 07:14:48 2014 UTC,"If the base is walnut then it's most likely Pearsall's, if it's stained oak then it could be Kroehler or Flexsteel etc."

The main thing I collect is glass, so I'm kind of a novice when it comes to furniture, especially on the different woods and finishes. I posted a picture of one of the legs above. Is there an easy way to tell?"
Mid_Century,2lk5ju,marygraces,5,Mon Nov 10 17:56:45 2014 UTC,I think the base is stained.  Is there an easy way to tell. Yes & No.  From the picture it does look like in place the surface color is gone and  the original wood is exposed.  If it was solid walnut that didn't have any stain than it would be very close to the surface color.  If there is a lot of contrast than it is more likely stained.  If it isn't exposed anywhere you could scrape the inside of one of the legs (a part that isn't visible) to see.  Either way for $25 you scored some awesome chairs.

It sold recently on Etsy, and the seller advised they didn't see a maker's mark. I missed out on the sale, so I'm trying to hunt one down for my own collection.  If not - have any suggestions on any similar designs? I like having the metalwork there for detail and pulls, versus something with recessed or protrusive wood pulls.  Much appreciated!"

Mid_Century,2ldr8x,TheodoreRoethke,3,Wed Nov 5 17:04:54 2014 UTC,"I'd buy the older one, I'll be honest. There's more history there, and you'll have something vintage to be proud of.   Also, cast iron is a heck of a lot harder than aluminum, so you don't have to worry about denting or scratching it."
Mid_Century,2ldr8x,Woolio,2,Wed Nov 5 20:57:06 2014 UTC,"The older one has a bit more patina, the top has some scratching and a couple chips. The cool thing about it is that the table was recovered from the Philadelphia Reserve as evidenced by the metal stamp on the bottom, so this table was used in the Mid Century era in a US mint. There is no Knoll stamp on the table itself, but it is visible on the base.  The newer table is a 50th anniversary and is in like new condition, which is what lured me to it over the vintage model.   Also just peeped the store on Google Street View, you can see the interior. I noticed that the older Saarinen table is in the picture which is from May, so they've had the piece in inventory for a while. Do you think I could leverage the price a bit?"
Mid_Century,2ldr8x,Woolio,2,Wed Nov 5 21:37:20 2014 UTC,"Ah, cool. So it's got a ton of history behind it.   Anyway, if it's been there a while, it's obviously not going anywhere. You might be able to make a deal where, if it's not gone in a month or so, they'll sell it to you for less. I don't know, things like that have worked for me in the past."
Mid_Century,2ldr8x,empty__,2,Wed Nov 5 23:00:49 2014 UTC,"I paid $900 for a 36"", so that's a decent price in my opinion. I would imagine the older cast iron one is worth more, and personally I love the heavy base -- this thing is a rock!"
Mid_Century,2l9idg,Emerone,15,Tue Nov 4 14:42:51 2014 UTC,Tell us that you paid $50 for it because the original owner didn't know what it was worth so I can freak out.

Great find by the way mine are white but the leather doesnt look as nice nor is the metal as shiny as yours"
Mid_Century,2l9idg,lawoodii,3,Tue Nov 4 16:13:15 2014 UTC,"If it's the same 4 feet straight base like mine, the ""contract base"", the chair was made between 1958 and 1968. If the aluminum stamp says ""Herman Miller Patent Pending"", it is a first year production model (1958). If your chairs fits these criteria, the leather is not leather, but vinyl.   Hope this help, and enjoy your chairs. I would love to see pictures of them."
Mid_Century,2l9idg,Liquidkp,4,Tue Nov 4 16:38:51 2014 UTC,"OP returns! my chair any idea on the value of these? 2 have tiny tears in the vinyl one does not, and does anyone recover these or can a normal upholsterer?"
Mid_Century,2l9idg,licoricestic,3,Wed Nov 5 01:38:17 2014 UTC,Apparently they are really difficult to reupholster because of how the fabric/vinyl is stretched. Only a few reupholsterers are equipped to do it and it's an expensive job.  As for the value of your chairs I would say 300$ / each but it's a wild guess.

Mid_Century,2l6upg,DFWPhotoguy,4,Mon Nov 3 20:26:13 2014 UTC,"There was an interesting auction this weekend that had a pretty eclectic mix of mid-century, retro, high end and designer pieces that  showed up on my radar. Went down an hour before the preview time closed to check things out and saw some very nice vintage pieces, great art yadda yadda yadda. I set some bids (online only) and went about my business.   This morning I wake up and won several things I didnât expect to win, including a pair of mint Ward Bennett chairs in green mohair.   Nowâ¦from a form perspective they are elegant, flawless in their current shape and the wood is gorgeous. Butâ¦they are 70s green. Iâve been looking to get a pair of chairs for my office and I think these would be great. But I hate the color. At 55 bucks a chair, I am not exactly invested but recovering them in something elseâ¦.cardinal sin? I get it, itâs Ward Bennett, itâs an iconic designer. But these chairs typically wouldnât jump out at most people and they are for me, not to flip (although I wouldnât mind having that ability in the future).   Soâ¦to recover or not recover, that is the question. Do I destroy all value if I recover? I would do it in the highest quality fabric and it wouldnât be cheap. I donât mind that at all. But I donât want this to be like âI donât like the smirk on that mona lisa chick, lets fix her upâ and ruin it.  So thoughts? Keep as is? Update? Shabby chic with zebra skin?"
Mid_Century,2l6upg,Woolio,4,Mon Nov 3 20:28:53 2014 UTC,"Well, if you're lucky, those cushions should be on plywood plates that screw into the frame of the chair.   So, if you really want to recover them, unscrew the current cushions, cut some plywood, build your cushions on top of it, and bolt them back into the chair. You can stick the cushions up in your closet or something in case you want to flip them later."
Mid_Century,2l6upg,anothercat,2,Mon Nov 3 21:22:53 2014 UTC,"Stapled fabric covered bottoms so I can't tell if they are just attached or not. No matter what, saving the orginal fabric if I decide that I am going to reupholster."
Mid_Century,2l6upg,Cat_Chat_Roulette,5,Wed Nov 5 20:33:37 2014 UTC,"I don't know about value but that green mohair has to go.  I can't think of any sort of modern setting it would fit in.  Unless you wear plaid jackets with really wide lapels and huge polyester ties in your office.  I like /u/liduidkp's idea of leather but I think these are too small to be tufted.  The finish looks pretty dark, black may not be the best way to go.    If you want to stick with fabric maybe something cream but with some goldish accents?  Maybe a pattern?  I guess it really depends on where you want them to fit in.  Either way the lines and wood do make these chairs great.  It's just a shame the cushions are truly a product of it's time.  As they stand they aren't 'timeless' like most mid century stuff is; they look really dated.  I think this may be one of the few times you can (and should) make an exception and make some alterations.    Edit: As someone who hates seeing classic stuff turned shabby chic I think your zebra skin idea is fantastic."
Mid_Century,2l6upg,horsenbuggy,4,Mon Nov 3 22:56:19 2014 UTC,"I'm a pretty big fan of recovering over the old fabric, or taking the old fabric off and storing it somewhere else in case I decide to resell them.  I've done that with a few chairs of mine.  I couldn't live with green mohair either, so I know what I'd do!"
Mid_Century,2l6upg,Lawnsrevenge,4,Mon Nov 3 22:58:27 2014 UTC,"From these photos the color looks like a jewel tone emerald green, not mint green. That would match in my house beautifully. But I guess I'm the only one who likes green?"

Mid_Century,2l1afq,texrev,5,Sun Nov 2 03:17:42 2014 UTC,"Nice set. Unfortunately though stripping and refinishing it probably isn't a good investment unless you really love the pieces and want to take the project on as a hobby.  The cheap and easy solution is to first color correct any nicks or scratches by applying a light stain that matches the original finish. This works well because the original finish will act as a barrier to the stain while any exposed wood will absorb it much more readily. If you want to take it a step further, you can next hand rub a little Briwax onto the surfaces as well. This will improve the luster of the finish and also further balance out any unevenness to the finish from wear. The downside to Briwax is that it loses it's luster much more quickly than actual refinishing and will slowly darken the stain over time. The good news is that it's cheap and easy and can always be stripped and finished in the future if and when you ever decide to have the pieces professionally done."
Mid_Century,2l1afq,SwillFish,5,Sun Nov 2 14:50:40 2014 UTC,"I agree.  Don't underestimate how long it takes to strip and refinish furniture.  Lane isn't that valuable that I would invest the time in refinishing, but I would fix up the worn spots and enjoy the pieces."

Mid_Century,2kxg7v,Woolio,6,Sat Nov 1 00:39:42 2014 UTC,"Basically the secret to successful thrift shopping is volume and frequency. Each week I visit three GoodWills, two ValueVillages, and two Church-run charity shops. Apart from those I visit two Habitat for Humanity ReStores and two GoodWills that are a bit further out every other week. Essentially like anything its a numbers game.  While I'm not in the market for furnishings at the moment I did put together a decent mid-century home wares haul this summer. For quality vintage items I have found what you find is largely determined by what kind of economic shape the area was in during the time the pieces you're looking for were sold in shops. Literally two or three blocks down the street from a Frank Lloyd Wright designed cottage in Milwaukee there's a church thrift shop with barbed wire fences. There's always good mid-century stuff popping up in that area, but you have got to be willing and committed to laying down the volume to get any of it."

Mid_Century,2ku98m,mirthquake,2,Fri Oct 31 18:57:05 2014 UTC,You could try using the descriptor for the individual designs as a modifier with the general term atomic/retro/mcm pattern  ie + starburst/sunburst (eg1); + diamond(eg2); + boomerang (eg 4).
Mid_Century,2ku98m,licoricestic,3,Fri Oct 31 22:02:39 2014 UTC,"The word ""Googie"" is sometimes used to specify this moment in 1950s design. It's often associated with hot rod cars, bowling alleys, and cocktail culture."

Mid_Century,2kqpqa,Mcflyguy,3,Thu Oct 30 15:35:08 2014 UTC,I took a picture because it was on the 3rd floor of a church that is being shut down.  No elevator.  Somebody went to a lot of trouble to get it upstairs to what had been used as an artists studio for 10 years or more.  It likely will be trashed by who ever takes over the building or tears it down.    It might be older but I associate the all metal kitchen units with the post war attempt to use the metal working abilities developed for the war for civilian purposes.
Mid_Century,2kqpqa,maybesaydie,1 point,Fri Oct 31 14:51:07 2014 UTC,Is that a kerosene stove? I love this kind of stuff.
Mid_Century,2kqpqa,maybesaydie,2,Sat Nov 8 01:18:35 2014 UTC,I don't think so.  I assumed it was just natural gas.  I like the streamline compactness.  Those paint enameled counters lasted without rusting a lot longer than the metal kitchen cabinets of the era and with a lot heavier use.
Mid_Century,2kqpqa,maybesaydie,1 point,Sat Nov 8 01:51:16 2014 UTC,"Some of those one piece kitchen were available through Sear and Wards and they could be ordered to burn kerosene or even coal. I have a bunch of catalogs from the 20th century. I'll look through them and see if there's something like that in none of them. If I find one I'll post a picture of it. I had a Monarch Gas stove from the forties.  New stoves are so flimsy. Metal kitchen cabinets weren't made to sustain the same kind of day in and out cleaning as stoves get. I'll bet the sink on that little kitchen is pretty sturdy, too."
Mid_Century,2kqpqa,maybesaydie,2,Sat Nov 8 02:06:10 2014 UTC,Cool.  I assumed it was natural gas because it is ubiquitous here and has been for 100 years.  It is Texas where the gas is anyhow.
Mid_Century,2kqpqa,maybesaydie,1 point,Sat Nov 8 02:10:55 2014 UTC,I don't know. It has kind of a late thirties look about it. Now I'm really curious. You said it was upstairs? It must weigh a ton.
Mid_Century,2kpa2y,mgriffioen,6,Wed Oct 29 18:56:19 2014 UTC,"Ooh, I like these... I like these a lot, actually.   I hope they hit their goal, but I'm not a huge fan of Kickstarter. I prefer to know that I'm actually going to get something if I throw money at it."
Mid_Century,2kpa2y,Woolio,5,Wed Oct 29 19:45:15 2014 UTC,"Oh, I agree...but I thought for only $12, it was worth the risk."
Mid_Century,2kpa2y,Woolio,6,Wed Oct 29 19:47:07 2014 UTC,"Definitely. And they've had some success with these before, they already sell a few decks on their website. I'd imagine the Kickstarter's just a way to drum up some extra funds before they go into full-scale production. These will probably land in their store even if they don't hit the goal."

Mid_Century,2kmels,cseyferth,2,Tue Nov 18 05:42:57 2014 UTC,"Awesome! Thank you big time! (Ok... looks like gold fleck paint. I can handle that to get mine back up to par).   Are you removing the hardware to refinish?! Before and after post at some point please!   As for the history of the brand, I believe they started in 1906 and only produced bedroom sets. Somewhere in the 20s they started expanding - and by the 50s they were known as a really great furniture company. I'd say pretty darn desirable for someone who is a little above an entry-level collector of MCM.   I think this set is early 60s - right at the end of the MCM period, but when some more mainstream companies were catching on.   When I did research on my pieces - I think I came up with a solid price around $1,300 for the china cabinet (maybe more depending on how many collectors you have in your area and what the average price they pay for MCM stuff is!). Good luck!"
Mid_Century,2kmels,ihminen,1 point,Tue Nov 18 15:13:21 2014 UTC,"Fantastic! You really just made my day. I'll probably hang onto it for awhile to enjoy its beauty and function (it's the coolest looking piece of furnitue I own by a mile) and get it back into ship shape to eventually sell it.  I just took the hardware out to snap some pics. Wasn't planning to refinish--I don't think I need to. I've got a leg to repair but the finish is bright as a daisy.   The only spots of wear are a few narrow inches of lightness exposed on a few of the hutch's edges where it likely rested or scraped against other pieces of furniture long ago. Do you know how to hide, undo, or significanlty diminish these few spots of wear? I'd be happy to post before and after pics.  Thanks again!"

I'm thinking I'll make it a little holiday display this year. Now you need to find the matching buffet!"
Mid_Century,2kmels,animalistics,1 point,Tue Nov 18 20:48:57 2014 UTC,"I'd love to find that buffet. It's now on my list of treasures to scour the earth for (along with the MAD Magazine straight jacket, a Buckminster Fuller Dymaxion car, an original Saarinen womb chair with ottoman, a Peter Behrins industrial clock, the Michelle de Lucchi Kristal end table, a long and vibrant Pearsall sofa, etc) The combined effect of the two looks dazzling! You really struck gold.   I'm open to the idea of refinishing, but have zero experience. I'm always eager to learn, but am hesitant to use such a nice piece as my first guinea pig. I'll give wax filler a whirl first. Any brand names you reccomend?  By the way, how did you confirm that these are made by American of Martinsville? I can't find their insignia anywhere on my hutch. Is it branded into the wood inside the door of one of both of your pieces? If so, I'd really appreciate it if you could share some images of the markings with me so I can use them as verification in case I do ever chose to sell it. There are stamps and letters all over the back, but nothing like that great little arrow logo I see on the A of M stuff I'm drooling over online.  I feel so fortunate that you responded to my post and instantly solved the mystery that may have taken me 30 hours of digging to unravel. If you happen to live in New England then I think it could be really neat to meet up and talk shop someday. Coffee or drinks are on me. I bet you occasionally need an extra pair of strong hands to move furniture. I sure do from time to time. Treasure hunting alone is a blast, but comparing finds with knowledgeable friends is a special kind of fun and education that I'm always game for. And if not, thanks a million for your helpful info and let me know if you need measurements or any additional photos."

Mid_Century,2kmels,ZaphodsJustThisGuy,3,Wed Oct 29 16:57:24 2014 UTC,"Is that no the right phrasing? I'm relatively new to MCM design and still learning the jargon. I think of atomic design as encompassing several qualities, one of which is a subtle slope of furniture's legs and windows that point to an imaginary spot located 20 feet above the piece.   I just googled ""atomic hutch furniture"" and here are the image results. It looks like I'm stumbling in the right direction.  If you know words or terms that more accurately describe this hutch, I'd really appreciate learning them from you. I know antiques and Deco, but MCM is described in many ways by many people, and being able to talk about items in meaningful and understandable ways is very important to me.   Please, lemme hear it all!"
Mid_Century,2kmels,jdoug13,6,Wed Oct 29 19:01:55 2014 UTC,"""Atomic Age"" is a common term for the period of design (or in general), that's where the ""atomic"" comes from."
Mid_Century,2kmels,toddmp,3,Thu Oct 30 07:57:58 2014 UTC,I like it. I just scored something similar for my collectible knick knacks.
Mid_Century,2kmels,toddmp,3,Wed Oct 29 19:35:02 2014 UTC,Frank Green?
Mid_Century,2kmels,toddmp,4,Wed Oct 29 04:04:23 2014 UTC,"Can't say definitively as I'm still too new at this, but that looks to me like a period replica/homage to the Broyhill Brasilia hutch.  Whatever it is, looks like it's well worth $60 to me.   We have two Goodwills near where I live.  One is small and has very little furniture,  but on my first and only trip there, looking for MCM stuff for the first time, I stumbled on a Bent Silberg Teak Filing Cabinet from Mobler for a mere ten bucks.  Then there's another one maybe ten miles away that always has a ton of furniture, and usually 2-3 midcentury items (typically veneer/formica, nothing high quality).  But this place seems to think that it's an antiques consignment place with its prices.  $100 coffee tables and $200 dressers.  Even its Yelp reviews wonder what's up with the pricing."
Mid_Century,2kmels,toddmp,3,Wed Oct 29 04:58:20 2014 UTC,"Those prices are wild for a Goodwill. Perhaps we're just spoiled, remembering $0.99 t-shirts and $5 used pieces of furniture available just 10 or 15 years ago. And perhaps the Goodwill, as a charitable organization, has every good reason to ride the current MCM train and get every penny they can from hobbyists and collectors like us. But vintage boutique prices like the ones you mentioned just don't seem right for that store, or for the Salvation Army.  I'm in Western Massachusetts (the middle of nowhere--130 miles to Boston or New York, the closest cities), and noticed this same trend in my region about 4 or 5 years ago. I chat with thrift store employees when I have the chance, usually asking about how merchandise is collected, separated, priced, and distributed. I even tried to get a job working at the region's Goodwill HQ, determine which donated items are of high enough value that they should be sold online or to dealers instead of in stores. I figured it would be the ultimate ""man on the inside"" gig for a dealer and enthusiast like myself.   The job didn't materialize but I learned a lot about how the organization handles donated. An old friend now works at a Goodwill store  and told me that a handful of experts (people like those of us who frequent this subreddit--antique/vintage/design enthusiasts with basic knowledge of old things, an eye for items that stand out as valuable or otherwise of special interest, and the skills to research value quickly and efficiently) separate everything into trash (things that are or unusable too damaged to sell), store goods (the stuff sold in thrift shops), and auction items (nicer things that they post on eBay and, I believe, on other sites) as well as the really high end stuff like gold jewelry and important antiques, which is sold through a network of specialists who work with the organization.   What no one has's explicitly told me, but I believe to be true, is that the employment of these merch specialists/appraisers, which wasn't part of our local Goodwill network until less than a decade ago,  led directly to the $200 dressers you mentioned, and to the $60 I spent on my hutch. I can't fault the organization for maximizing revenue, but it sure takes some of the magic away from finding ""the big find.""  Though I'm happy to report that steals are definitely still out there! Just a couple months ago I scored this geometrically distinct walnut and tubular steel coffee or office table made by Howell Co. from the same Goodwill where I found the hutch, and paid a whopping $2.50. I believe it's from the 1950s, shortly after designer Wolfgang Hoffman left Howell but still during the post-war boom that turned the small Chicago company into a worldwide smash. That's what Goodwill stands for in my mind.   This summer I bought this 1965 Stratorester recliner by Futorian Co. (maybe designed by Milo Baughman--I'm having a hard time confirming or de-confirming this) for $25 at a nearby Salvation Army. $25 isn't pocket change, but I'm still thrilled about this find.  In the spring I bought this electric blue Shaw-Walker swivel office chair with Lucite bumpers under the front points of the shining chrome frame, upholstery that is lush, durable, and radiant, heavy-duty vintage plastic armrests, smooth and silent action at every moving part, like-new springiness and support from the backrest, seat, wheels, and swivel rod, and ""August 16 1978"" hand-stamped on the underside. It's in near-mint condition, as if it were bought in '78 and stored carefully since then, and I paid $15.    So I still pop into thrift shops whenever I pass one and have the time. Usually I buy nothing, and sometimes feel frustrated that there are fascinating and beautiful pieces I would have gladly paid $10 for, but pass on because they're priced at $85. All in all, though, these stores are a huge boost to my livelihood and my excitement about collecting and dealing in old things. Even the Goodwill a block from my girlfriend's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan overflows with neat and reasonably priced old stuff (designer lamps, this Olympia typewriter that I just sold on eBay, high-end old frames and prints, and other hip decor items from the 70s and earlier.) That store is generally cheaper than the one in my 6,000 person town.  (end of rant)"
Mid_Century,2kmels,intravenus_de_milo,3,Wed Oct 29 18:56:13 2014 UTC,"Very informative, thank you.  I was pretty sure that sure that it wasn't going to be a popular opinion, but I'm glad someone else has noticed.  I keep stopping by, but like you I've passed on several things that I'd have certainly snatched up had they been appropriately priced.  In the last two months  on Craigslist I've found a set if cesca chairs, 5 for $5 each, and four fiberglass shell chairs for $10 each.  That's what I'd expected to see in thrifts based on my experiences in college back in the 90's, and the lean years that followed"
Mid_Century,2kl3s8,riomx,8,Tue Oct 28 17:17:28 2014 UTC,what if the chair is allergic to grass?

Mid_Century,2kl3s8,mullacc,5,Tue Oct 28 18:25:38 2014 UTC,Go to your local drug store's allergy section and buy some adhesive felt pads for the chair legs.

Mid_Century,2kl3s8,Woolio,2,Tue Oct 28 20:05:44 2014 UTC,"If it's real wood, or thick enough veneer, it's not past refinishing. If it's that old, it probably needs one. I like the challenge, so I don't mind."
Mid_Century,2kl3s8,Woolio,1 point,Tue Oct 28 20:09:01 2014 UTC,It doesn't need refinishing. This post is just a joke about how some sellers randomly stack the chairs on the table top for no reason in their Craigslist and eBay ads.
Mid_Century,2kl3s8,Hodaka,3,Tue Oct 28 20:36:45 2014 UTC,"Because it's trendy!   Actually, that's a really good question. Why do people stack chairs on their table?"

They were pretty common in the late mid-century period, but they usually fell into Hollywood regency style rather than MCM proper.   Here's a listing for one that looks similar to yours: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VTG-LARGE-RETICULATED-BRASS-FOLDING-TRAY-TABLE-HOLLYWOOD-REGENCY-COFFEE-MCM-/251662799968?pt=Antiques_Furniture&hash=item3a98459460  It was really popular to buy these, and then when the legs broke, hang the plate on the wall. My grandparents did that with theirs. Later on, manufacturers started including little eye hooks on the back for hanging."
Mid_Century,2khe5c,Woolio,3,Mon Oct 27 18:04:47 2014 UTC,Brass Tables/Trays like these were very very common in the Near/Middle East/North Africa in the 50's and 60's - and are still fairly common today. We have one from Morocco my Grandfather got there in the late 50's. That stand is something else though.  I dig it.
Mid_Century,2khe5c,itoddicus,3,Mon Oct 27 19:34:25 2014 UTC,"I'd just never seen anything like it before. I guess when they got popular they never made it as far as rural Illinois.  Yeah, the stand is what sold it for me.  I'm going to make a template of it and make some legs like it next time I build a coffee table."
Mid_Century,2khe5c,Woolio,2,Mon Oct 27 21:11:48 2014 UTC,"I found a few described as Turkish but wasn't sure if that was more of a style or if they were saying where it was made (since mine's from India).  I'll have to look up Hollywood regency, since I don't know much about it.  I've just been collecting MCM for a while and had never seen one of these.  It looked very out of place when I picked it up at a little country estate sale.  Thanks for the info!"
Mid_Century,2khe5c,didnotwanttoregister,4,Mon Oct 27 18:14:03 2014 UTC,"Hollywood Regency is pretty much the opposite of Midcentury Modern. It's a very opulent, gaudy style, drawing from the Victorian design themes with more international flair.   It's really interesting, but I wouldn't have it in my house. Not willingly, anyway."
Mid_Century,2khe5c,didnotwanttoregister,3,Mon Oct 27 18:50:32 2014 UTC,"I collect mid century furniture but since I already have a coffee table I love, I bought this piece hoping to flip it. I only paid $55 for it, but I really don't know how much it might be worth. It just kind of spoke to me.  I can't find much information online.  It's about 3 feet wide with a solid brass top that's marked ""made in India N/B"" on the bottom.  The legs are collapsible, being just 3 hinged pieces that fold apart to hold up the table."
Mid_Century,2khe5c,Hodaka,3,Mon Oct 27 17:48:21 2014 UTC,Looks like it could be by Lane.  I've seen a few of these around..personally I think they look better with round glass replacing the metal tray. Usually marked $200-$500 when I see them.   Doing a google image search for Lane brass tray mid century coffee table brings up many instances of pretty similar if not spot on tables.

George Nelson seems to have made a number of different cabinets as well as ""chests"" to place on top of dressers, etc.   Unfortunately I don't have $6500 or $8900 to throw at something like this, and while I don't know your financial situation, I'm betting you wouldn't throw that kind of money at a jewelry cabinet either. There don't appear to be anything on Ebay or Etsy that I can find. There's this modern one, which is okay I guess. From what I'm seeing, I have a feeling you may have to settle for something less than ideal, or you would be better off having it custom made.   There's this Ikea hack - meh. Maybe you could do a better job. The only similarity I see with this hack is the shape.  There are a few companies that make a reproduction of the tall George Nelson armoir, such as Control Brand, Inmod, June Moon Furniture. Most are priced at around $1000. I think that's still pretty expensive...  Anyway, I ended up not finding much, but there's a lot to think about at least. Maybe if you find a decent stand, you can have the cabinet built. It seems like that part would at least be rather simple for someone who knows what they are doing. Good luck, let us know if you end up finding anything."
Mid_Century,2k291o,tallread1,2,Thu Oct 23 15:15:57 2014 UTC,Those are the ones I found last night. As for budget. Eh. Thrift shop budget. Looking at no more than 300. I have some legs that will work great if I can just find a nice sleek cabinet. But I don't want particle board. That's going to be my main issue is finding a real wood cabinet for that low of a price. Thanks for the ideas. About to take my lunch break and go check out a few fb the shops down here in BR.

You can get a small amplifier here: ThingyLab and solder a few wires and it'll be ready to go. Since the internals are gutted anyways it wouldn't be ruining anything."

Mid_Century,2jx3gd,riomx,3,Tue Oct 21 19:49:42 2014 UTC,"If you removed all of the components, it's just a cabinet. It's not worth much just because it's old."

It's old enough to have been the pre war variety, which radios of that type are worth a bit more than the ones with today's FM band."
Mid_Century,2jx3gd,riomx,6,Tue Oct 21 22:20:33 2014 UTC,"As a collector of vintage audio, it always bums me out to see people who rip out components of old cabinet radio and record systems.  ""I couldn't figure out how to make ONE thing work, so I ripped it all out!"""

Am I better off leaving everything original, or putting something in that sounds better?   http://i.imgur.com/UJ9Ut5w.jpg"
Mid_Century,2jx3gd,F-That,3,Wed Oct 22 10:43:38 2014 UTC,"Nothing wrong with putting in a better set of speakers.  But, if it's a bit thin sounding, it might be the electronics getting old.  Solid state stuff is easier typically - but replacing all paper-wax capacitors and all the electrolytics can often make a BIG sound difference.  I just recapped a Sansui CA-2000 pre amp, which is about 10 years newer than your unit, and the sound improvement was immediately audible.  This takes someone who's schooled in electronics repair, but it's not a hard procedure."
Mid_Century,2jx3gd,toddmp,2,Wed Oct 22 16:04:00 2014 UTC,Yeah it sounds hollow if that makes sense. I am not going to replace capacitors myself but maybe one day I will get it done. Maybe Ill try some other speakers before i pull out the old one and see how they sound.

Mid_Century,2jv993,Astrobratt,2,Tue Oct 21 21:05:07 2014 UTC,"After stripping the piece (I used Klean Strip), I made sure it dried overnight before staining, and then lightly sanded it, due to the tendency of stripper raising the grain of wood. Then, I decided to use Varathane's ""American Walnut"" 'cause it looked pretty and the name was fitting, hehe. With a t-shirt, I applied the stain by rubbing it onto the wood in circles and spread it as far as it could go before adding more stain."

Mid_Century,2jmste,-FattyMcLoudMouth-,3,Sat Oct 18 20:03:40 2014 UTC,"Looks like a Westnofa Siesta Chair, but it isn't. The legs cross over rather than bend into each other.   It could be another Westnofa chair, or a knockoff, but Westnofa was never a big enough company to be knocked off, really."
Mid_Century,2jmste,Woolio,3,Sun Oct 19 01:19:48 2014 UTC,"The Siesta chair got pretty famous at the time. There are Siesta chairs in the White House (though I admit I don't know when that happened).  Minor nitpick, although you might know this: Westnofa was not a manufacturer, but a trade organization created in an attempt to market Norwegian furniture abroad, especially in the US.  Westnofa is completely unknown in Norway as a brand, where the Siesta chair is more closely associated with Ekornes and LK Hjelle. It was originally manufactured by Vesterlandske MÃ¸belfabrikk, who is also semi-well-known among furniture geeks; Ekornes later aquired Vesterlandske. The rights were later acquired by Rybo, and later LK Hjelle.  Westnofa was perhaps not a big success, but I think the design itself got famous enough that it got copied. Pretty sure this is one such knockoff."
Mid_Century,2jmste,lobster_johnson,2,Sun Oct 19 18:41:50 2014 UTC,"I actually didn't know that about Westnofa. I had just assumed it was a brand, didn't realize it was a marketing front."
Mid_Century,2jmste,Woolio,2,Sun Oct 19 18:53:43 2014 UTC,Wow that's awesome.  That's a lot of info. I appreciate the help. I guess it's a knockoff. Just started getting into mcm. Thanks for the help.
Mid_Century,2jmste,lobster_johnson,2,Sun Oct 19 22:20:56 2014 UTC,"Looks like a Siesta knockoff. Looks like something from the 1970s, maybe early 1980s. Not MCM, I think."

Mid_Century,2jm8b8,SwillFish,4,Sat Oct 18 19:58:30 2014 UTC,I used several coats of primer then several light coats of Rustoleum. The light is VERY lite aluminum metal so had to be careful not to bend it while I had it apart.

I'm also not sure if it'll fit with my overall decor, but I could probably find a place for it if it's worth something.   My biggest concern is that it just looks boring, so even if it's worth something it'd be a pain to flip or use in my own home. It looks like office furniture, almost."

Mid_Century,2jl8ti,howard__roark,3,Sat Oct 18 20:12:19 2014 UTC,"Modernica sells the original George Nelson Case Study bed, as well as other models. Affordable, comes in different sizes and materials. (This is the bed frame I have.) Also comes as a daybed/sofa.  Complement it with a nightstand from Modern Conscience. They also sell some beautiful dowel-leg tables, and they sell shell chairs with new and original Eames shells.  Etsy is a great place to find MCM furniture, either used or new. Lots of small-scale furniture makers that make beautiful, well-made stuff. Hedge House, for example, has some gorgeous bed frames.  AmbienteDirect is a European online store that ships to the US quite cheaply. Some of their stuff is surprisingly cheap. They have many of the big brands, like Kartell and what not.  France & SÃ¸n produce replicas. It's made in China, but the quality is actually, surprisingly, very good.  Speaking of replicas, if you need lighting, tudÃ² & co looks like a great alternative. Never purchased anything, but apparently their products are of high quality.  Other retailers: Design Within Reach (DWR), West Elm, Room and Board, Crate and Barrel, CB2."
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,lobster_johnson,2,Sat Oct 18 22:41:24 2014 UTC,"I love Modernica. Shame Herman Miller hates them because they jumped in to fill the void when HM stopped doing the fiberglass shells, and they had no legal grounds to sue them over it.   Also, thanks for the France & Son link. I know where I'll be buying my PH lamps in the future. (What right does a lamp have to be $1200?)"
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,Woolio,2,Sun Oct 19 01:22:12 2014 UTC,"I'm sure Herman Miller does perfectly well even with that competition. Their brand name is very strong, as is the PR value of being the ""authentic"" version.  The replica situation is interesting. Designer furniture that today is extremely expensive was once a lot more affordableâ and available to a wider range of people. I grew up in a middle-class home with furniture by Fritz Hansen, Kartell and Knoll. I once read (can't find the sourceÂ anymore, I think it was on the web site of UK replica manufacturer Voga) that Arne Jacobsen decreed that the ""7"" chair (Fritz Hansen Model 3107) should always cost 70 DKK. The earliest inflation calculator I found was for 1967, and at that time 70 DKK would be the same as around $100 today. A new ""7"" today costs around $550 and upwards!  Designers and manufacturers today are definitely overcharging. I believe anyone should be able to copy designs if they put the same amount of craftsmanship into it.  I truly detest low-end replicas, though. There is a store in New York City called Sitdown NYC, and it's full of poor Chinese-made copies of famous pieces. Unfortunately, I suspect some of it is from France & SÃ¸n, or they use the same manufacturer. Its hideous version of Greta Grossman's Grasshopper floor lamp that copies the earlier hinge-jointed version doesn't seem to be using brass for the joint, it actually looks like it's painted with brass paint. Here is the France & SÃ¸n one, and it looks suspiciously like Sitdown's to me. This is the original, early version, no longer manufactured, clearly real brass. And this the beautiful brass ball joint used by current versions."
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,lobster_johnson,4,Sun Oct 19 02:24:37 2014 UTC,"The Herman Miller - Modernica thing is actually really interesting, because Modernica is legally in the clear due to a small section of patent law that states that, for a physical product to have plagiarism protection, it has to be in continuous production for the duration of its patent. Since Herman Miller stopped using fiberglass in their Eames chairs in the late 90s, the physical patent has since become public, which means anyone can manufacture an Eames shell from the same molds and not have it be a breach of patent.   That's much the same for most of the Mid Century designer furniture. At some point during its lifespan, it went out of production for six months or more, the patent was never renewed, and it became open to the public. After that, knockoff manufacturers started producing exact copies, or nearly-exact copies.   The biggest litigation against Modernica was a trademark lawsuit from Herman Miller this year, since Modernica had been using the Eames name and trademark to identify their chairs. Since Herman Miller still owns the Eames trademark on certain pieces of their furniture, Modernica can't use it in their advertising. That's fair enough, I think, since they've done a bit to differentiate their product since then.   (For older knockoffs, like the Selig or Plycraft Eames lounges, they changed some part of the design to avoid patent infringement. That's why most of them sit differently, use different materials, etc.)   But yeah, a lot of this stuff was meant to be cheap, reliable furniture back in the day. And now, since it has some fancy names attached to it, the same manufacturers that worked with these designers are using the goodwill they fostered back then with the designers and their families to charge extortionate prices on their products today. Charles is rolling in his grave, I'm sure."
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,Woolio,2,Sun Oct 19 02:45:46 2014 UTC,"Didn't know about the patent stuff. Very interesting, thanks."
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,lobster_johnson,2,Sun Oct 19 03:34:23 2014 UTC,"Do you have any sources on the patent stuff? I'm really keen to read more into it because I have always wondered about vintage vs. authentic vs reproduction furniture when the designs have been around since the 50s and 60s.  For example, I have been looking to buy an Eames Storage unit and an Eames lounge chair, but I have decided that I will buy whatever is cheaper and built to the exact specs of the original design. That means that Modernica and Rove concepts are the inexpensive alternative to Herman Miller and are less than a third of the price. The only thing you seem to get with buying from HM is the ""officially licensed"" product (whatever that means) with a donation to maintaining the Eames estate."
Mid_Century,2jl8ti,vincent_vancough,3,Mon Oct 20 00:46:08 2014 UTC,"Online retailer Dot & Bo is one of those sites with short term themed sales, but lots of mid-century stuff and pretty good prices."

You shouldn't have a problem finding disparate pieces that go together aesthetically and have similar warm wood colors.  There's a local vintage store that has cheap stuff near me-- lesser quality and often beat up, but nice lines. Maybe there's something like that near you. If you're willing to put in some TLC you could get some great results.  Of course, this is coming from a college student -- my budget is one step above ""DIY eames chair out of ramen noodles"" :)"

How to Tell if It's the Real Deal To distinguish the real Noguchi table from the cheap knockoffs, we have etched Noguchi's signature on the longest edge of the glass top and on a medallion on the underside of the base."
Mid_Century,2j8plo,cwilo,2,Tue Oct 14 18:59:18 2014 UTC,So... was it legit?  Don't leave us hanging!
Mid_Century,2j8plo,AZZTASTIC,3,Tue Oct 14 21:34:27 2014 UTC,I need to go back and look. Update tomorrow I promise. I don't think it is though.
Mid_Century,2j8plo,messier_is_ok,2,Tue Oct 14 21:36:09 2014 UTC,Well you can see in the pic that this one is a fake. It has a shock mount on the top of one of the legs and also no signature on the glass. Damn Shame because I really wanted a legit one at this $200 price.
Mid_Century,2j8plo,licoricestic,7,Tue Oct 14 21:45:52 2014 UTC,Why not get it and enjoy the design? I'd love a real noguchi table and I've seen one in real life(with the signature). I'd still love the knock off because they are ascetically pleasing.
Mid_Century,2j8plo,DFWPhotoguy,3,Tue Oct 14 23:03:14 2014 UTC,I may get it because I actually need a table. I just want to pay less but who doesn't.

Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,2,Tue Oct 14 17:46:06 2014 UTC,Yeah but we can make this one better
Mid_Century,2j81rj,Rocknthehawk,3,Thu Oct 16 19:43:09 2014 UTC,"If you find it comfortable, any decent chair is worth that much. However, it doesn't look even close to the Eames design, and is a terribly inaccurate replica. There is no button tufting, the arms have no double piping, the proportions and size looks very off, and the base isn't even close. Is it real leather? If it is, it's worth $200. If it's not leather then it's about how much you want to pay for a chair that looks kind of like an Eames lounger."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,1 point,Tue Oct 14 17:42:31 2014 UTC,"Have you ever taken apart a reproduction before? They are most certainly not worth $200, especially incomplete. Even the most high-quality reproductions such as Selig and Plydesigns cut corners.  This one in particular is a poor reproduction, with its awful armrests and wooden backings."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,Rocknthehawk,2,Tue Oct 14 22:56:32 2014 UTC,"I have reupholstered an Eames lounge chair, I own a Selig and a Plycraft. I'm interested in hearing where you think they cut corners. They were offered as affordable alternatives.   I've seen one of the chairs pictured before, the proportions are off. If you like it, it's worth it. I would pay $125-$150 for it and make it a little project without feeling bad about hurting value."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,2,Wed Oct 15 21:42:39 2014 UTC,"If you've reupholstered an Eames Lounge Chair and own both a Selig and Plycraft chair, you shouldn't even be asking that question [ignore asinine comment - what I meant is that you can identify the differences in quality]. The gulf in quality of craftsmanship and materials couldn't be wider.  I recently refinished and reupholstered a Plydesigns Chair, which in my opinion is one of the vintage reproductions that comes closest in regard to quality and proportions to an authentic chair. The other being later 70s Selig reproductions. Both companies became quite brazen in their copying by that time.   Early Plycraft and Selig reproductions are much further behind in quality than Plydesigns and later Selig chairs, especially in regard to veneer, thickness of shells, hardware and bases.  Plydesigns Chair  Plydesigns Chair  Late Selig Chair  Plycraft Chair  EDIT: Just realized I forgot to elaborate further. In seeing how well the Plydesigns chair is built in comparison to Plycraft and Selig chairs, I was still appalled at some of the crappiness of it. The plywood that shapes the cushions and sits in the shells is made from fairly light and low-quality wood. The thread inserts for bases were placed very shoddily, though secure. I would say the most valuable part of the chairs are the bases and back support frames. Also, the veneer was really thin.   Plycraft chairs are made with less thick shells and cheap screws, and the bases are nowhere near the quality of Plydesigns and later Selig bases."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,Hodaka,3,Wed Oct 15 21:53:17 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the pictures and information, you're more knowledgeable than I am about each design and specifics.  I asked the question because someone looking at a $200 replica compared to a $4500 original might want to know the difference in what they're getting. That's all!"
Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,2,Wed Oct 15 23:06:55 2014 UTC,"Sorry - to be honest, I've had a really bad day at work and I misinterpreted the tone of your question. My apologies."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,Hodaka,1 point,Wed Oct 15 23:19:40 2014 UTC,Plycraft did use the exact same wooden base as in the photo. They often broke when people leaned back in the chair. Later models went to metal.
Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,2,Mon Oct 27 04:00:12 2014 UTC,I never said they didn't. And I've seen and passed on the models you're talking about.
Mid_Century,2j81rj,Hodaka,1 point,Mon Oct 27 04:27:56 2014 UTC,"I had one, and the base cracked and splintered. Impossible to repair."

Mid_Century,2j81rj,fritzing,1 point,Mon Oct 27 05:13:26 2014 UTC,Just keep an eye out for visible cracks or camouflaged repair jobs.
Mid_Century,2j81rj,vincent_vancough,1 point,Mon Oct 27 05:24:37 2014 UTC,"Why are you judging the chair compared to the Eames lounge? Clearly this is an interpretation of the design and is not trying to be a replica. It looks like it is made by plycraft, with a possible association to George Mulhauser, so I think $200 is a reasonable offer. The biggest pill that swallow is the lack of ottoman."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,E-Rok,4,Wed Oct 15 13:34:44 2014 UTC,"I was judging compared to Eames, because that's what OP seems to think it is."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,muscled,2,Wed Oct 15 17:41:50 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. I certainly love the Eames lounge. I'm on the lookout for one myself, but one thing I respect about the earlier knockoffs is that they tended to produce interpretations of the original design rather than duplicating it. I'm sure there were legalities to this, but I still prefer it to the cheap, identical versions being produced today. The versions plycraft and Selig produced were non-deceptive alternatives to the original."
Mid_Century,2j81rj,E-Rok,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:16:42 2014 UTC,What are the markings like underneath?  It is a lovely looking chair though!
Mid_Century,2j81rj,riomx,0,Tue Oct 14 15:53:48 2014 UTC,No.
Mid_Century,2j7yaa,rodface,2,Tue Oct 14 14:55:29 2014 UTC,Cool.  I've noticed some nice MCM design in a few commercials actually. Maybe not as obviously iconic as the WD ad though. The one that comes to mind is this Mitsubishi ad.
Mid_Century,2j7yaa,mullacc,2,Tue Oct 14 15:29:11 2014 UTC,Cool! There was also a Peeps (I think) ad I posted on here a while back.
Mid_Century,2j5zth,marygraces,10,Mon Oct 13 23:50:13 2014 UTC,"It's hard to see what condition the fabric is in. Especially for an older couch, the threads can start falling apart after you've sat in it a few times. It appears dirty or discolored around where you would put your hands, but that could be just the lighting.   I would say $450 is appropriate for this couch if the upholstery is in good condition."
Mid_Century,2j5zth,spaceflunky,7,Tue Oct 14 03:38:00 2014 UTC,"I agree. It all hinges on the upholstery because it will cost $300 to $600 to reupholster, depending on whether or not it needs new foam, batting, springs, etc."
Mid_Century,2j5zth,animalistics,3,Tue Oct 14 04:44:40 2014 UTC,it could cost a lot to reupholster!
Mid_Century,2j5zth,spaceflunky,5,Tue Oct 14 07:11:43 2014 UTC,"If the upholstery is good, though, I couldn't get the $450 out of my pocket fast enough. :)"
Mid_Century,2j5zth,animalistics,2,Tue Oct 14 13:39:23 2014 UTC,What fabric sofa or seat have you ever sat in began to dethread itself from use? I've bought plenty of fabric items and have never experienced this.
Mid_Century,2j5zth,riomx,6,Tue Oct 14 05:41:55 2014 UTC,"If the fabric is not maintained properly overtime it will lose its elasticity and the fibers will become brittle. Ive seen it only furniture, cars, and anything with upholstery really."

Mid_Century,2j5zth,atheista,2,Tue Oct 14 07:58:43 2014 UTC,Whilst I love most MCM furniture I've never really been attracted to the MCM sofas that I have seen. This on the other hand is absolutely brilliant and I would snap it up in a flash.
Mid_Century,2j5zth,dildosmith,2,Tue Oct 14 08:50:23 2014 UTC,"To rephrase the question, ""would I spend $450 on this?"" Yes. In a hot second. Even if I had to get the couch reupholstered, the lines and small footprint would make this piece worth the trouble to me."
Mid_Century,2j5zth,toddmp,3,Sat Oct 18 21:18:46 2014 UTC,Wow. Gorgeous.
Mid_Century,2j3xty,obamapastry,3,Mon Oct 13 12:09:39 2014 UTC,"Excellent job, and free to boot! It looks great, congrats :)"
Mid_Century,2j3xty,tallread1,2,Mon Oct 13 14:42:49 2014 UTC,How did you go about tightening the straps? I have one that needs them tightened (since pirelli doesn't make the size strap anymore I can't just replace them).
Mid_Century,2j3xty,TramStopDan,3,Mon Oct 13 15:14:59 2014 UTC,"On ours there are metal ends to the straps and they slot onto holes on the other side of the seat. Using pliers I removed the ends, then cut the straps a little shorter and reattached the metal bits."
Mid_Century,2j3xty,dildosmith,2,Mon Oct 13 15:27:23 2014 UTC,That's lovely! Great job. And you have a lovely piece that will serve you for years.
Mid_Century,2j4h5n,aerinjl1,8,Mon Oct 13 15:50:02 2014 UTC,"I like it. And I think $400 is reasonable, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to talk 'em down a bit.   But here's my advice: don't buy it unless you love it. $400 is reasonable, but it's hardly disposable. There's a ton of MCM stuff out there- on craigslist, eBay, Etsy; at Goodwill, Salvation Army, Savers, etc., and the prices vary widely. If you're into it, you'll enjoy the hunt, and you're bound to find something you love (it may cost a little more than this one, it may cost a little less).   And when you find something you love- if the fabric's not just right- have it reupholstered and turn it into the sofa you've always wanted. Upholstery is definitely pricey, but it's an investment. You'll see that a lot of the older sofas are built like friggin' tanks; they're built to last forever. And it's totally worth it to end up with a one-of-a-kind piece that you adore.   I dunno. That's just my two cents.   edit for additional info: BTW, I just had two sofas (one MCM, the other just vintage) and three MCM chairs professionally reupholstered. The fabric was ~$1000 (purchased at JoAnn and Hancock using coupons), and the labor was ~$2700. The upholsterer I chose, however, quoted me a price about 45% lower than the other guys. He was super affordable and did a great job.   I was able to spend a fair amount on the upholstery because the furniture itself was practically free, except for the big sofa. Flexsteel Thunderbird sofa (9' long), $550, eBay; smaller three-cushion sofa, $5, Savers; Kroehler Avant lounge chair, $4, Savers; Danish wingback armchair, $26, Village Discount; ladies lounge chair, $15, Goodwill. I will be posting tons of pics once I get that room painted, so stay tuned. : )"
Mid_Century,2j4h5n,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Mon Oct 13 16:09:32 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I've been looking for months and it seems that MCM pieces seem to be much harder to come by here (Deep South, bless my heart). ON the other hand, they don't seem to be snapped up as quickly though. This is the first piece I have 'clicked' with so I'm torn between perhaps waiting forever for 'THE ONE' or purchasing this and being content.   I have 0 experience with upholstery, how much would I be looking at? $300 or $3000?"
Mid_Century,2j4h5n,OnlySlightlyEvil,4,Mon Oct 13 16:15:32 2014 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. I had my heart set on something very specific, which was a gondola-style sofa. And it had to be a good price because, unless it was the perfect color green or the perfect color purple, it was going to be reupholstered. It took me over a year to find it. So please believe me when I tell you I feel your pain. I'm hoping upholstery labor, in general, is cheaper where you are than here in Chicagoland. I think you're looking at about 15-18 yards of fabric, and $1500 to $2000 on labor. If you have a JoAnn or Hancock in your area, you should never pay more than 60% of the listed price of the fabric. Most of their coupons are for 40% off, sometimes they're 50% off, and every once in awhile you get lucky with 60% off. And they do accept each other's coupons, I believe. Actually choosing the fabric becomes the hardest part."
Mid_Century,2j4h5n,weenur,2,Mon Oct 13 16:37:28 2014 UTC,"I actually looked into reupholstering a very similar styled sofa which I acquired for free.  For labor alone, the quote was $1500.  The found some great vintage-style fabric for $400, but that's when I stopped shopping.  It was really too big and too expensive of a project.  That was my reality check with upholstery-- it's always much more than you think it will be."
Mid_Century,2j3gny,Patticat,3,Mon Oct 13 06:42:29 2014 UTC,Plywood/veneer or wood?

Mid_Century,2j3gny,LatinHoser,2,Mon Oct 13 18:18:19 2014 UTC,"It looks like the top is wood looking laminate? I may have the matching dresser. I bought it at Goodwill for 20$ and refinished it with swedish oil. It was in really rough shape, but after with some elbow grease it came out great."
Mid_Century,2j3gny,LatinHoser,2,Mon Oct 13 13:23:44 2014 UTC,Yes.  I like that the rest is wood and has a deep color.  Did you get it in the Bay Area?
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,Patticat,4,Sun Oct 12 06:50:48 2014 UTC,"I have two similar side tables and coffee tables - these things are awesome because you can't hurt them.  No coaster, no problem.  Stains?  Nope.    Love em."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,ZaphodsJustThisGuy,5,Sun Oct 12 13:52:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but that's part of collecting and using mid century stuff. My Lane table needs coasters but the wood grain is more beautiful."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,ihminen,3,Sun Oct 12 16:05:59 2014 UTC,"Definitely, but these tables were just as integral to the mid century furniture world as your Lane coffee table was.   Two sides to every coin."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,Woolio,2,Sun Oct 12 20:16:40 2014 UTC,"Get what you like, this is true for everyone.  That aside, laminate material was the lower cost commercialized versions of the already commercialized stuff like the wood veneer Lane products which were already mass produced. To me, laminate doesn't really carry the spirit of MCMs emphasis on natural and organic forms."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,ihminen,8,Mon Oct 13 02:24:53 2014 UTC,"You're implying that, because it's not designer, it's not MCM. But that's just not true, MCM encompasses everything from Eames and Pearsall to Broyhill and American Standard. While there is a distinction that has to be made, we should realize just where that line is drawn.  The spirit of MCM, at its forefront, is not design. It's economics. It's ""How do we build better furniture more cheaply?"" The organic forms and good design came from those restrictions, they were not an afterthought.   Look at the Eames shells, for instance. They were hugely commercialized, and became a design icon of the midcentury period. But they didn't become what they are because of their scarcity, but because of their ubiquity. They were cheaper than almost every other armchair and sidechair on the market, they held up better, and they were comfortable enough to sit in for long periods of time. They were the first use of fiberglass in furniture, and were a technological marvel.   And nobody says they're not MCM, or they're not good, or they're not designer furniture because they were cheap or readily available.   Formica was much the same. It was originally a technological marvel, a status symbol, something everybody wanted. It was durable as hell, and cheaper than real wood. It exudes midcentury culture as a whole, and defined a very significant part of it, even though we look back and see it as nothing more than a cheap novelty.   So stop being so snooty and get back to loving the mid-1900s. Because that's why we're here, not to lord over each other with our fancy, bourgeois furniture, but because we have a passion for this sort of thing.   I'll leave you with this: Lane's not much of a saint either, and certainly isn't as desirable as you make it out to be. If you don't trust me, maybe you'll trust /u/brass_and_rosewood: LINK"
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,Woolio,1 point,Mon Oct 13 03:19:27 2014 UTC,"You've really gone off without understanding what I wrote. Almost everything I have is American made, very few Scandinavian pieces. I'm not a snob about the origin of pieces. Everyone has an aspect of the design era they admire, and I prefer wood to laminate surfaces on furniture. I'm certainly allowed to believe that wood veneer represents the aspects of MCM I most admire, just as you are allowed to like Formica laminate.  I have nothing against mass produced stuff. I have Scandinavian glass that has been produced in the hundreds of thousands. I specifically said Lane was commercially mass produced. Read before you make a buffoon of yourself."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,ihminen,3,Mon Oct 13 04:29:39 2014 UTC,"I understood what you wrote. If it didn't completely express your personal opinions, however, isn't that your fault? I made do with what I had, and it's apparently pretty solid according to the votes."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,Woolio,3,Mon Oct 13 13:35:03 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of furniture that must be cared for.  But  I consider it a positive that there are a few items that I don't have to worry about in that way.  It's a good thing, particularly if you have kids, which I do.    My coaster discipline is outstanding.  I won't sit on my leather chairs without a blanket over them if I'm wearing jeans with particularly pointy rivets or buttons that day.  But my four year old - well he's four.  Coffee tables are like floodlights to moths for them, it's one of the few things in a house that works with a kid's height."
Mid_Century,2j0dkj,ZaphodsJustThisGuy,3,Mon Oct 13 04:32:00 2014 UTC,"I suppose another way would be to try to refinish wood veneer in a more modern water resistant finish, bit that takes a lot of time and energy.  I personally find the extra care worth it for real wood grain."

I had a few that I've sold off but I can tell you about how to id a real one.   Vintage pieces are constructed from Teak, Walnut, or Beech wood. The best way to ID a real chair is look at how sculpted the arm rest is, there should be a raised lip on the outside, and the armrest is rather thin compare the the rest of the frame. I've never seen one that is legit without a ""Made in Denmark"" stamp or a Selig emblem."

They have been around much longer and have an excellent reputation."
Mid_Century,2i9fqg,F-That,4,Sat Oct 4 16:32:29 2014 UTC,"Whether that is true or not, they are obviously copying Thrive's products   ...who is obviously copying earlier MCM designs.  Regardless, if you take the chair in OP as an example, the Thrive Kennedy and the Joybird Soto are clearly reproductions of the Z chair design, and otherwise don't have a lot in common.  What's the latest on that lawsuit? The most recent thing I could find was something about the plaintiff not bothering to follow through on the prosecution. I don't think that's enough to suggest Thrive over Joybird; go where the design takes you."
Mid_Century,2i9fqg,toddmp,3,Sat Oct 4 17:46:35 2014 UTC,I like joybirds take on the pieces better than Thrive though. Maybe the people who ran Thrive were dicks so some people left. Happens all the time in business. I'm guessing joybirds has the same quality and customer service.

Mid_Century,2i4s1b,torknorggren,5,Fri Oct 3 01:56:31 2014 UTC,"It's a byproduct of the way wood is harvested from felled trees. The first step in the process is that the wood goes to a mill or is processed locally by someone who owns a small mill. These leave the wood very rough and in rough dimensions. This is where people like me step in and buy the wood. We then process it down to the desired thickness and, of course, lengths and widths. For stuff like this, woodworkers will always buy from a hardwood seller, not your local big box store."

The ones I have are an older design than what I could find online - they have high backs and wood that extends fully up the back instead of stopping at the arms, meaning they're incredibly elusive, apparently.

Mid_Century,2i2590,autowikibot,2,Sat Oct 11 03:00:40 2014 UTC,"Michael Thonet:       Michael Thonet (2 July 1796 â 3 March 1871) was a German-Austrian cabinet maker.  Thonet was the son of master tanner Franz Anton Thonet of Boppard. Following a carpenter's apprenticeship, Thonet set himself up as an independent cabinetmaker in 1819. A year later, he married Anna Grahs, with whom he had seven sons and six daughters. Only five of the sons, however, survived early childhood.  In the 1830s, Thonet began trying to make furniture out of glued and bent wooden slats. His first success was the Bopparder Schichtholzstuhl (Boppard layerwood chair) in 1836. Thonet gained substantial independence by acquiring the MichelsmÃ¼hle, the glue factory that made the glue for this process, in 1837. However, his attempts to patent the technology failed in Germany (1840) as well as in Great Britain, France and Russia (1841). Thonet's essential breakthrough was his success in having light, strong wood bent into curved, graceful shapes by forming the wood in hot steam. This enabled him to design entirely novel, elegant, lightweight, durable and comfortable furniture, which appealed strongly to fashion - a complete departure from the heavy, carved designs of the past - and whose aesthetic and functional appeal remains to this day.

Once the gunk is off, and the bench is dry, try sanding with 200 (and finer) sandpaper. I used an orbital attached to a shop vac. The cool thing is that you don't have to sand it down to the wood, or strip it. Next, apply Restor-A-Finish with Super Fine (0000) steel wool.  The ""zero count"" roughly correlates to grit on fine sandpaper.  Here are some speakers being refinished. I watched this one and some others.  Here is an enthusiastic person who details her experience. I figured if a product can create such happiness, it must be worth looking into."

Mid_Century,2hnazs,Shakes8993,2,Sat Sep 27 21:31:26 2014 UTC,"Nice.. just out of curiosity, how much does it cost to do reupholstering?

The frame is usually top notch though and it never occurred to me to reupholster."
Mid_Century,2hnazs,secrentagEnt,2,Sat Sep 27 22:55:28 2014 UTC,"Leather is expensive, typically starts around $11 sq/ft. You have to buy an entire hide at a time, which is around 55-60sq ft or roughly 6 yards. Fortunately we get discount hides from time to time. With labor and materials if I were doing this for someone else I'd estimate it at $800-900 (with discounted leather and new foam.)   It's not cheap, but if you have a quality piece it's usually worth the investment. You really get what you pay for. I take a lot of pictures of furniture from different price points, sofas from $500 to $15000 so people can understand what they're buying."

Wonder what it'd look like without handles, build into the drawer a bit of a lip instead of handle so it's more rounded out and streamlined.  The top has same feature of rounded out edges.   Won't see that anymore because it has to be solid wood instead of veneer.  I think as a bedroom set though, you'd have to be more conservative with the styling, it'd look too much like a spaceship."

Then it's done unless I can Google the name of the chair and find out more. If there was a backlink, we can see the back story, possible read other comments and learn more about the item."

Mid_Century,2h76ea,callmesnake13,2,Tue Sep 23 18:08:08 2014 UTC,"Mine weren't exactly unwanted...   I found one in a local MCM antique mall, and the one in Asheville was a couple who bought one without the screws, couldn't find them, and decided to sell it instead of searching. (I found the same thread screws at a local auto parts store, but they're hex-heads instead of philips.)  Basically, I got extremely, extremely lucky. However, I have passed up Eames shells in the past, specifically the later upholstered ones, because you can't remove the upholstery without a lot of work. Both of mine have been pre-1960 upholstered shells, where the upholstery is held on by a wire ring rather than glue. The upholstery does mold after a while in our humidity, so I buy the old moldy upholstered shells, take off the covers, and wash them down.   A map would be interesting, though, just from the logistical standpoint."

I'm not sure how much was exported to the US though.   On eBay UK this set sold for Â£87 (image here). These have a buy-it-now price of Â£200.

Mid_Century,2gsbz6,marygraces,2,Fri Sep 19 06:17:56 2014 UTC,"Can you give me a guess on how many board feet of 6/4 this took to build? (excluding the cabinet, which you mentioned was plywood)."
Mid_Century,2gsbz6,sabadsneakers,2,Fri Sep 19 22:33:58 2014 UTC,It's about 17 board feet - but any lumber yard will add the 10% waste factor so figure it's 19 board feet.   Depending on the quality it should run you anywhere from $7-12 BDFT. Most are in the $8-9 BDFT range. I usually try to use quartered for the posts because it's super straight but lately quarters walnut prices are through the roof.
Mid_Century,2gsbz6,Woolio,4,Sat Sep 20 05:12:05 2014 UTC,Sexy
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,TheDoug77,4,Thu Sep 18 17:13:02 2014 UTC,Definitely some cool elements there! I notice a ton of colleges have older awesome furniture and architectural designs.
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,detmoose,3,Thu Sep 18 18:37:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Florida Poly is actually in the same city as Florida Southern University, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Florida Southern is a beautiful example if Mid Century Architecture.   http://panotracks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/gallery/florida-southern-college-120414/fsc-041012-315-fb.jpg"
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,strong_grey_hero,3,Fri Sep 19 16:53:09 2014 UTC,What kind of chairs are these?
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,mullacc,4,Thu Sep 18 19:08:54 2014 UTC,Swoop Lounge Chairs.  I didn't recognize them on sight but since I knew all the other chairs were Herman Miller I figured those would be too.
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,strong_grey_hero,2,Thu Sep 18 19:39:50 2014 UTC,Cool!  Nice looking chairs!  Interesting.  I can't find them for sale at DWR or Hivemodern.
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,mullacc,3,Thu Sep 18 20:22:57 2014 UTC,Huh. Looks like it's a commercial/education only offering. Maybe Herman Miller keeps thing out of the retail channel for the first few years? This chair certainly seems like it'd work in a home.
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,Woolio,2,Thu Sep 18 20:37:54 2014 UTC,"I don't doubt you could probably order them through the commercial channels if you had an interior designer do it for you, or you yourself had some sort of (perhaps farcical) home business.   They're $1800 through the catalog."
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,Woolio,4,Fri Sep 19 01:14:04 2014 UTC,"That's almost as nice a building as the City of Arts and Sciences... Which was also designed by Calatrava, so I guess it makes sense.   I am not entirely convinced the man doesn't think he's building spaceships instead of buildings..."
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,appreciate_it,2,Fri Sep 19 01:16:41 2014 UTC,Looks expensive!
Mid_Century,2gs0f7,milesprowers,4,Thu Sep 18 21:57:54 2014 UTC,That was my first thought. I am torn between being happy to attend a school this cool and wondering if my tax dollars were blown excessively on the project.
Mid_Century,2greco,marygraces,6,Thu Sep 18 13:48:34 2014 UTC,They look terrible and $275 is way to high. :/
Mid_Century,2greco,Emerone,6,Thu Sep 18 18:32:13 2014 UTC,"Those are really cool. I don't consider 275 that bad, but then again I live in New York and you get raped on anything even remotely mid century."
Mid_Century,2greco,LesCactus,2,Thu Sep 18 15:27:47 2014 UTC,I just moved from the NYC burbs and I agree the prices there are out of control. I've been lucky out here in eastern CT. People here are not into MCM. Lucky for me!
Mid_Century,2greco,MercuryChild,5,Thu Sep 18 19:02:51 2014 UTC,Looks like cabin furniture.
Mid_Century,2greco,redascot,2,Thu Sep 18 18:41:47 2014 UTC,LOL!! Too funny!!
Mid_Century,2greco,Hasselbuddy,8,Thu Sep 18 19:00:39 2014 UTC,I wouldn't care who made them. They're solid oak and they look sturdy. 275 still seems pretty steep.
Mid_Century,2greco,untbunny,8,Thu Sep 18 15:24:51 2014 UTC,"The oak is a turn off for me. I agree though, $275 seems high. Around half that would be the selling price where I'm at."
Mid_Century,2greco,galacticprincess,2,Thu Sep 18 16:08:49 2014 UTC,The oak would have been a total turn off for me as well... Yesterday I asked about how to take care of a piece that had been stored in a basement. Toddmd sugested I head over to reddit wood working. Now I'm cray cray about wood!
Mid_Century,2greco,Inch4723,2,Thu Sep 18 19:04:41 2014 UTC,I just hope they are still available!
Mid_Century,2grwd2,sabadsneakers,4,Thu Sep 18 16:37:03 2014 UTC,pass. looks too close to a cheap Ikea chair. A pong or something.
Mid_Century,2grwd2,SARASA05,3,Fri Sep 19 00:48:28 2014 UTC,Next!  Not a fan of this chair.
Mid_Century,2glwvh,pantiloons,3,Tue Sep 16 23:23:07 2014 UTC,I think your desk isa vanity.  Cool none the less.  The chair is neat.  Does it sit well?  I like both items.
Mid_Century,2glwvh,untbunny,2,Wed Sep 17 03:49:01 2014 UTC,"I use it just as a work desk haha. Since it's finished the top is water proof, which is nice. The chair does sit well, holds my weight well. I read in it when I get the chance, but it's mostly my cats abode. I found both items at a two different second hand stores. I love mid-century furniture, and I also like cheap things. I was just wanting to see if what I got were remakes or genuine. Either way, they fit my room well, and suit my needs. Thanks for the comment!"
Mid_Century,2glwvh,untbunny,2,Wed Sep 17 04:00:21 2014 UTC,And that is the reason to purchase any style furniture!  I apologize if I came acros wrong.  I like both pieces.  Can't help on manu but they appear genuine.  Nothing wrong with using the piece as a desk.  Now get off Reddit and straighten the room!  Lol
Mid_Century,2glwvh,strong_grey_hero,2,Wed Sep 17 04:04:50 2014 UTC,"I actually appreciate the information though. I had originally thought vanities had to have mirrors, but that's not the case lol"
Mid_Century,2glwvh,weenur,2,Wed Sep 17 04:10:59 2014 UTC,"It looks kind of like a Salterini, but I'm not sure."
Mid_Century,2gmd0i,marygraces,5,Wed Sep 17 02:02:12 2014 UTC,Post a picture and ask over at r/woodworking
Mid_Century,2gmd0i,toddmp,2,Wed Sep 17 06:14:18 2014 UTC,Thanks! Will do!
Mid_Century,2gmd0i,kittycatcate,3,Wed Sep 17 14:37:53 2014 UTC,"Maybe just a good cleanse with some Murphy's Oil Soap, followed by Danish Oil and Feed n Wax.  That usually does the trick."
Mid_Century,2gmd0i,Inch4723,3,Wed Sep 17 13:06:50 2014 UTC,I do not recommend Murphy's oil soap. It leaves an oily residue that you will need to clean off before you apply any sort of new finish. Water + steel wool + elbow grease.
Mid_Century,2glifx,A_lo520,5,Tue Sep 16 21:09:45 2014 UTC,"Being in the market for a used one, I hope its real and you get a smoking deal on it."
Mid_Century,2glifx,F-That,3,Tue Sep 16 21:54:08 2014 UTC,Thanks! I'll keep you posted..
Mid_Century,2glifx,F-That,2,Tue Sep 16 22:56:04 2014 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/IZRpw  Purchased! Obviously it will need to be completely refinished, however, it'll feel nice to invest in something that I will enjoy for a long time. Now hoping to come across some boucle or cato fabric at the right price.."
Mid_Century,2glifx,ElQuesoBandito,1 point,Fri Sep 26 20:52:02 2014 UTC,"Nice! It does look like someone got shot sitting in it, but non the less it will get a makeover.  I'm pretty jealous right now. I still cant find one locally. I did come across a old posting for 7 of them for sale in my area that the University of Utah was selling because they found bedbugs on them. They cooked all of them in a oven at about 140 degrees to kill them and then auctioned them off. All 7 of them sold for $350. WTF!!!!"
Mid_Century,2glifx,strong_grey_hero,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:44:58 2014 UTC,Baking those chairs is not enough. Students' gross feet and dreads rubbing all over them every day demands nothing short of incineration. Or a good washing would work I suppose. And the angle on the headrest portion is just steep enough where it's difficult to get into a good napping position. Gotta hang your head off the side to get comfy.
Mid_Century,2glifx,strong_grey_hero,5,Tue Sep 30 03:51:54 2014 UTC,"From what I can tell, yes.  The knock-offs usually mess up the shape or the bend of the frame.  It also looks old enough not to be one of the high-fidelity Chinese knock-offs that have flooded the market in the last few years.  The foam does harden on these, so whatever you get it for, allow $1000-$2000 for material + reupholstery."
Mid_Century,2glifx,strong_grey_hero,3,Tue Sep 16 21:46:43 2014 UTC,Heard. I have an opportunity to purchase it for $500 which would give me plenty of room work on it within it's refinished value. It is said to be from the original owner who tells me it is 10-12 years old. Solid investment?
Mid_Century,2glifx,strong_grey_hero,7,Tue Sep 16 22:00:41 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, yes.  More proof of its authenticity would be good.  I have an older one that I paid $1000 for, and I'm going to end up under the current going price still.  You should do well.  Be sure to watch eBay for authentic Knoll boucle fabric.  You'll need 9 yards (7 for chair, 2 for ottoman).  Here's a great resource on Womb Chair specs."
Mid_Century,2glifx,Hodaka,3,Tue Sep 16 22:08:07 2014 UTC,"Thank for that source! I wondered about the sizes on them.. Also, thanks for lead on Knoll fabric. I really hope this is the real thing and maybe even find some markings/tags. Are you aware if the frame will have a Knoll marking?"
Mid_Century,2glgxe,EasyDoesIt18,3,Tue Sep 16 20:56:38 2014 UTC,http://www.houseplans.com/collection/themed-mid-century-modern-ranch-houses  Any builder should be able to follow the plans you purchase. There are a ton out there.
Mid_Century,2glgxe,toddmp,2,Tue Sep 16 22:13:27 2014 UTC,Thanks.  I've looked through the site and I cant quite find what I'm looking for.  Any other sites for MCM plans that you know of?
Mid_Century,2glgxe,toddmp,2,Wed Sep 17 00:40:18 2014 UTC,Well here are the ones from the king himself still available: http://www.houseplans.com/exclusive/joseph-eichler  more under contemporary: http://www.houseplans.com/collection/contemporary  old catalogs off ebay are a great source: http://grainedit.com/2009/05/25/mid-century-modern-home-plans/
Mid_Century,2glgxe,toddmp,3,Wed Sep 17 01:31:22 2014 UTC,"Also I will say this. The classic ""open"" mid-century design is notoriously hard to cool. Since this has the potential of being put in Las Vegas you might want to seriously investigate ways to modernize the cooling ability of the style."
Mid_Century,2glgxe,howard__roark,3,Wed Sep 17 01:43:39 2014 UTC,"Why not hire an architect to design your home for you?   If you're dead set on finding a set of plans, look into the case study homes. There are several books out there covering them and most have scaled floor plans."
Mid_Century,2glgxe,punoff,2,Tue Sep 16 23:41:29 2014 UTC,"I've thought about working with an architect but what I'd really like is to find original plans from the 60's.  I picked up a book on the Case Study Homes and although its a great reference, it doesnt really contain complete plans or even layouts. I might be able to narrow it down and search for specific Case Study Home #'s.  Thanks."
Mid_Century,2glgxe,strong_grey_hero,2,Wed Sep 17 00:42:38 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest buying some vintage modern house plan books from ebay or amazon. They typically have an artist's impression of the completed house and an actual top-down plan showing the layout. As suggested above, you'll need to incorporate current energy saving technology and materials to keep costs sensible. Here's an ebay search to get you started:   http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2051337.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC1.A0.H0.Xmodern+house+plans.TRS0&_nkw=modern+house+plans&_sacat=267  As you can see, some of these vintage plan books are priced ridiculously. To save a bit, find out the actual title of the book from the seller's description then search again on ebay and amazon to find the best price."
Mid_Century,2giolk,connka,5,Tue Sep 16 01:41:10 2014 UTC,I like the side table - that's not IKEA is it?
Mid_Century,2giolk,atanincrediblerate,5,Tue Sep 16 15:33:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it is! People are always shocked when I tell them that."
Mid_Century,2giolk,cougasaurus,4,Tue Sep 16 16:33:00 2014 UTC,I have that exact side table next to me in my office right now.
Mid_Century,2giolk,riomx,3,Tue Sep 16 20:32:46 2014 UTC,It's a reproduction of a table they began making in 1956
Mid_Century,2giolk,atanincrediblerate,4,Thu Sep 18 20:45:39 2014 UTC,I see it now (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80270125/)  How the hell did I pass this last time I was in the store?  Gotta pick one up next time I'm there.
Mid_Century,2giolk,riomx,3,Thu Sep 18 20:50:57 2014 UTC,http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80270125/   It came out sometime in the past year. Check where they usually have the Stockholm tables (their other retro-inspired line)
Mid_Century,2giolk,atanincrediblerate,2,Thu Sep 18 21:05:33 2014 UTC,Love the Stockholm like - picked up the chestnut colored TV cabinet a few weeks back.  Really like the Stockholm dining table too.
Mid_Century,2giolk,riomx,2,Thu Sep 18 21:57:20 2014 UTC,"Me too. I like it a lot. Just don't have the type of decor to go with it. I'm glad they're making them, though!"
Mid_Century,2giolk,F-That,5,Fri Sep 19 02:21:23 2014 UTC,"I like the sofa. Great color.   I have a room I started furnishing and I think I am into it broke even after selling an ottoman on Ebay. Ill have to do the math, but keeping an eye out on craigslist pays off. I have a chair, love seat, lamp coffee table and 2 end tables so far."
Mid_Century,2giolk,DooWopMafia,5,Tue Sep 16 01:54:10 2014 UTC,I'm a big fan of that couch (tufted!) and the lines on that chair. I've been piecing together a living room set from craigslist.
Mid_Century,2giolk,saidthegirl,3,Tue Sep 16 15:46:05 2014 UTC,Go you! Baller on a budget.
Mid_Century,2giolk,fat_al142,3,Tue Sep 16 03:29:48 2014 UTC,great start
Mid_Century,2giolk,JohnnyBsGirl,3,Tue Sep 16 16:59:16 2014 UTC,"This is awesome! I especially love the couch. We also are doing it on a budget. It's taking us longer than it might if we could just go into the 6 or 7 MCM-focused vintage stores in the area and buy whatever we want when we want, but it's happening."
Mid_Century,2giolk,Woolio,2,Tue Sep 16 17:15:54 2014 UTC,"Love the sofa, not so much the chair... The design looks more or less fine, I just can't handle that fabric.   That said, it's still a great find if you like it."
Mid_Century,2giolk,MercuryChild,2,Tue Sep 16 14:54:39 2014 UTC,I feel like I would need a shower after sitting in that chair.
Mid_Century,2giolk,marygraces,3,Tue Sep 16 15:29:07 2014 UTC,"Same. I'm working slowly at recovering it myself, but I wanted to post a picture of the chair before I start the process (because I am reallllly slow at reupholstering)."
Mid_Century,2giolk,Farged,2,Tue Sep 16 16:34:02 2014 UTC,Well done! I'm an ikea fan for kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities... But this is defiantly the way to go! Great work! Wasn't it fun finding all the treasures?!

Mid_Century,2ghqok,Rocknthehawk,3,Thu Sep 18 16:31:50 2014 UTC,I would agree with this...but last week i sniped two replica eames lounge chairs near boston for $150 each.

Mid_Century,2gh7qa,tallread1,3,Mon Sep 15 17:44:26 2014 UTC,"You can make a link post that automatically directs to your images, but the downside to that is that all of your text information either has to be in the title or in the comments, similar to what you've done with your images here.   Adding images in the comments works fine for a small sub like ours, but for future posts I think your best bet is to actually put the link for the images in your description for the self post. You can practice in this post if you would like.  Here's the wiki page about formatting that I find most useful. Anything you can do in the comments, you can also do in the self posts.

Mid_Century,2geddf,Hasselbuddy,3,Sun Sep 14 22:58:03 2014 UTC,"This is a Minka brand fan, it's really beautiful and seems to work well so far.  My wife couldn't believe that I bought a $500+ fan,  but I love it."
Mid_Century,2geddf,weenur,3,Sun Sep 14 23:12:40 2014 UTC,I have Minka fan in our living room.  They have a lot of simple designs that go well with MCM decor.  Also- very quiet and efficient.
Mid_Century,2geddf,SARASA05,2,Mon Sep 15 14:11:29 2014 UTC,"I agree, super quiet, efficient. This fan doesn't produce much light though. Minka sells a different light cover to make the light ""white"" vs. the warmer tan that the fan comes with and that might cause more light."
Mid_Century,2geddf,callmesnake13,4,Tue Sep 16 23:08:49 2014 UTC,I love those fans but they're so expensive and I rent. If anyone's seen a nice mcm friendly ceiling fan that isn't too expensive I'd appreciate the lead.
Mid_Century,2geddf,SARASA05,2,Mon Sep 15 00:21:30 2014 UTC,"My dad found mine for me at a shop in Washington DC. Someone had ordered the fan, never picked it up, and the shop sold it to my dad for almost half price (which is still very pricy). Excellent moment for me! Good luck in your search."

I'd paint the walls... probably white and add framed art (I don't care for MCM art, so I'd put up large photos from travel and stuff I've done). If you have extra money I'd find someone to replace those white built in cabinet doors with wood so they look more substantial. These tips are all just my person taste and may have nothing to do with MCM! I love design. You've got the beginnings of a great space!"
Mid_Century,2geddf,SARASA05,2,Sun Sep 14 21:58:03 2014 UTC,"I just finished installing the fan, which was exhausting.  The plan for the cabinets now is to remove the top ones,  and sand/stain the bottom doors/framing (oh the days without so much MDF).   These cabinets actually connect the living and dining room, so once they're gone you'll be able to see from the living into the dining room.  Right now the living wall is a dark grey accent wall, so I'll do this wall (dining walll) the same color to living room wall to highlight it as a single long, shared, wall.  Hoping it'll look kind of dramatic, plus I like the idea of opening the space up."
Mid_Century,2geddf,Woolio,2,Sun Sep 14 23:10:07 2014 UTC,"My house is also various shades of light grey with white trim. I think I looked more carefully at your trim and some baseboard trim was black? I'd paint that white! Or if I had tons of money, I'd remove the trim and put in a nice strip of wood. Someone mentioned removing the tile. The tile doesn't look bad and would look better with a rug, I think. I have horrible brown carpet but no the budget to install the wood floors I'd like to have someday. ....someday!"
Mid_Century,2geddf,SARASA05,2,Tue Sep 16 23:12:05 2014 UTC,None of these pieces are authentic MCM.  I'd be interested to hear ideas on rugs or other finishing items.   Thinking a MCM buffet if I can find a reasonably priced piece.
Mid_Century,2geddf,SARASA05,3,Sun Sep 14 20:58:14 2014 UTC,"Get yourself a big tapestry to fill that wall, then find a credenza/buffet to put in front of it. That'll go a long way to making it look finished."

Mid_Century,2gadph,Woolio,5,Sat Sep 13 16:49:40 2014 UTC,"It looks like a fireplace, since it has the weird brass screen in it."
Mid_Century,2gadph,SummerTimeBroccoli,3,Sat Sep 13 19:23:26 2014 UTC,It does look like a fireplace. I would love to know what exactly it is so I can buy one of my own!
Mid_Century,2gadph,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Sun Sep 14 00:31:31 2014 UTC,"Me, too.   C'mon, OP. Let us see more."
Mid_Century,2gadph,marygraces,3,Sun Sep 14 05:05:22 2014 UTC,Beautiful!!
Mid_Century,2gadph,weenur,3,Sat Sep 13 15:41:30 2014 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/cA79vke.jpg Yes it is a free standing fireplace, I was on the lookout for one of those Malm types but found this at a yard sale with a $200 price on it luckily the sellers were motivated and I showed up half and hour before it ended with $75 and it was mine, I haven't hooked it up yet but am thinking of putting a small heater in it for effect until then."
Mid_Century,2gadph,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Sun Sep 14 15:11:10 2014 UTC,"I want to do this on my 4-seasons room too.  Those fireplaces are really sexy, but not efficient and I don't want the dirt/hassle of actual wood burning.  If you end up retrofitting this with an electric heater, I'd be really interested in the process."
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,midcenturymonster,6,Fri Sep 12 20:48:07 2014 UTC,"The garden beds are cool! I would like to add a fence to my front yard. I need to keep my pugs from running into the street. My house was built in the 1950's. I am surrounded by sea captain houses in Mystic CT. I live in the historic district, and must keep my house historically accurate. I have not found much landscaping ideas ""out there"". Thanks so much for brining up this subject."
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,marygraces,3,Sat Sep 13 03:36:09 2014 UTC,"Yes, I hope this thread gets more traction because I'm honestly curious. Maybe you can post pics of your front or backyard and we can brainstorm? I too need a front yard fence. I think we're probably going to go with a short horizontal version but that probably won't work for you. Maintaining historical accuracy sounds challenging but perhaps the parameters helps with narrowing down the multitude of options out there. Anyway, I'd love to see a pic of your house!"
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,MsModernity,8,Sat Sep 13 04:49:54 2014 UTC,"We are currently in the process of having a courtyard & carport built onto our MCM home. It's originally a William Krisel design, but the courtyard addition is a bit more like some Eichlers I've seen, with frosted plexiglass panels and brightly colored doors. It features some geometric cut-outs that will eventually contain lush plants like ferns, philodendrons and a red Japanese maple."
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,F-That,7,Sat Sep 13 05:02:41 2014 UTC,"That looks great. My wife wants me to turn our carport into a garage but I think it will murder the look of the home. I really wish we had somewhere to store tools and motorcycles, but I don't want to lose my carport look.   http://i.imgur.com/scALRfh.jpg"
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,MsModernity,3,Sat Sep 13 13:43:54 2014 UTC,What if you put in one of those all glass garage doors? http://s2.hubimg.com/u/4368565_f520.jpg
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,MsModernity,3,Sat Sep 13 18:41:57 2014 UTC,"Those doors, while cool, always strike me as more industrial modern rather than MCM. /u/F-That's house has such a great Midwest modernist (almost Prairie) look."
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,MsModernity,3,Sat Sep 13 19:02:43 2014 UTC,I see your point. How do these strike your fancy? http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/59/06/11/5906119acab1b77897225ed4897dc16e.jpg
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,F-That,2,Sat Sep 13 19:22:53 2014 UTC,Ha! That argyle one is cute. I feel like those are more 50's ranch than MCM...like boomerang coffee tables and metal-rimmed dinette sets. Fun though.    But OP's carport set up is so sleek and elegant right now. I think a garage door would make the house suddenly seem boxy.
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,MsModernity,2,Sat Sep 13 20:11:25 2014 UTC,After reading your idea of extending the carport I completely agree. My understanding of what exactly is MCM is squishy at best. I think my brain kind of groups together all things modern retro. This sub is helping though.
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,F-That,3,Sat Sep 13 20:20:23 2014 UTC,You monster!!! ð
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,F-That,2,Sat Sep 13 20:38:57 2014 UTC,That looks dope.
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,Cat_Chat_Roulette,3,Sat Sep 13 23:43:35 2014 UTC,"I agree hat the carport looks great and goes better with an MCM home than a garage. However, perhaps you could extend the carport forward a bit to be flush with the rest of the overhang in the front. Then you would have room to build a storage room in the rear, starting at the door and going back (eliminating that pass through).   It seems like you'd have enough space then to store a motorcycle and some tools in a 6'x10' store room. The access door could go off to the side, so the front of the store room could be faced with brick like the rest of the house."
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,Cat_Chat_Roulette,2,Sat Sep 13 19:00:04 2014 UTC,That's a good idea for sure.
Mid_Century,2g8fwy,F-That,4,Sat Sep 13 23:44:07 2014 UTC,That is hot! Love it! Show me your carport when you get the chance. We're adding one too at some point off the side of our house so we can enclose the one that's currently attached.

I bought these vintage strap chairs at an auction over the summer and recovered them and then had to make a table to go with them.

Mid_Century,2g8fwy,tallread1,2,Sat Sep 13 03:04:43 2014 UTC,Same here except I'm hoping to get started before summer. It gets sweltering in the summer. We're getting a cool front tonight though. High of 76 for one day and then back to the 90s.
Mid_Century,2g7ylo,Shakes8993,3,Fri Sep 12 18:08:05 2014 UTC,"I think that light may be the upper portion of a photo enlarger. My wife has/had a enlarger collection and it has a very similar feel to those things. In fact, she took a very similar one apart and uses it as a hanging light. Its cool as a light. Industrial chic, but not MCM in my opinion."
Mid_Century,2g7ylo,xTomBx,2,Mon Sep 15 12:26:33 2014 UTC,Awesome.. thanks a lot. I was doing a little more research and found out that they stopped using the fabric cords in the 30s so I guess its a photo enlarger light from the 20s-30s. Thanks again for your help. I would never have figured that out.
Mid_Century,2g7ylo,eyespeeled,4,Mon Sep 15 13:13:08 2014 UTC,"Saw a nice mid century cabinet on Craigslist and when to pick it up and the guy had this whole store of things. Apparently he is a collector and got the store because storage units were getting expensive. Anyway, he said it was ok to look around and picked up a whole host of things including this and a couple of brass or copper portable heaters, leather doctors bag, a hand held copper fire extinguisher and a couple of other things for $10 each. He was in the process of moving more of his stuff into the store over the next couple of weeks and with prices as reasonable as this, I'm going to go feel like those picker people. There was a lot of furniture that I never got to see.  Anyhow, does anyone know what the hell this lamp is called? It's one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Very exciting day. Had to tell people that might appreciate it."
Mid_Century,2g7ylo,eyespeeled,3,Fri Sep 12 18:16:14 2014 UTC,"To me, the lamp looks industrial and a little homemade (what with the green bent wire). No expert here, by any means, so I have no idea what its purpose or name, sorry.  Would love to see the pictures of your other finds."

Mid_Century,2g505j,NoFuturist,15,Fri Sep 12 02:56:12 2014 UTC,So last month my workplace was getting rid of some old furniture they had laying around in storage. So I asked if I could take a look and I  came up with four Herman Miller plywood chairs (2004 Red Lacquer version) for free! Two of them were in excellent condition and the other two just needed a little bit of touch up paint to cover some scratches. This is probably one of the best scores I've ever had.
Mid_Century,2g505j,marygraces,6,Thu Sep 11 20:49:54 2014 UTC,Let's hope this is the first of many many amazing scores!  Yea for great work finds!
Mid_Century,2g505j,FeloniousMonk12,7,Thu Sep 11 22:09:17 2014 UTC,Wow!  Where do you work and are they hiring? :-)
Mid_Century,2g505j,rodface,3,Thu Sep 11 21:06:36 2014 UTC,Seconded!
Mid_Century,2g505j,in_circles,6,Thu Sep 11 23:33:30 2014 UTC,Spiderland upvote. Beautiful chairs too.
Mid_Century,2g505j,jfk_sfa,5,Fri Sep 12 05:43:45 2014 UTC,That is absolutely killer. What kind of workplace has four Eames LCWs just laying around in storage? The only chairs we have tucked away are ratty office chairs that have missing arms and casters and coffee stained cushions.
Mid_Century,2g505j,Woolio,8,Thu Sep 11 22:42:32 2014 UTC,"I know there's a secretary in my university's psychology department that has, no lie, at least twenty Eames shells in her office.   She apparently just scavenged them as they were renovating older buildings and selling the furniture. She actually didn't know what they were until I flipped one over and told her, just sort of liked the chairs."
Mid_Century,2g505j,PrincipalBlackman,5,Fri Sep 12 03:53:55 2014 UTC,It's a tech company. From what I understand they used to be inside the executive offices. But they're always getting new stuff. I also got a Herman Miller Aeron chair but that's not really mid century.
Mid_Century,2g505j,nasieo,3,Fri Sep 12 00:04:24 2014 UTC,Cat looks pleased. By which I mean I sincerely hate you. Love those chairs.
Mid_Century,2g3z87,lwkane,4,Thu Sep 11 15:24:01 2014 UTC,The poor man's Blenko. I kid! I kid! :) Now makes me want to post my Blenko collection.

Mid_Century,2g3z87,Woolio,2,Thu Sep 11 20:44:06 2014 UTC,Well thank you! I have plenty of MCM furniture and such that I will share when I have a chance to take some pictures. :)
Mid_Century,2g3z87,Woolio,5,Thu Sep 11 20:37:02 2014 UTC,"So that's what those are. I've been seeing them in the shops lately, $15-20. Apparently they go for quite a bit more than that. I've been trying to find some in the opaque orange glass, but I haven't had much luck lately."
Mid_Century,2g3z87,tallread1,3,Thu Sep 11 19:27:25 2014 UTC,"The opaque ones are more difficult to find for sure and can be a bit more costly. Have you tried Esty, Ebay, Pintrest, etc. Also Google search other manufactures of this type of glass... Epic, Fenton, they are sometimes called drip, swung and stretch vases too. Good luck on your search. That's my favorite part, besides when I find one for a steal!"
Mid_Century,2g3z87,tallread1,2,Thu Sep 11 20:49:17 2014 UTC,"I saw ten of them last month, $15 each. Knew I should have bought them when I had the chance.  Guess I'll keep looking."

I will try and post them all later. The newest one is the 20"" tall red to yellow vase in the middle. Picked him up last weekend for $30 bucks!  I also collect depression glass but I'm really digging these now."

Mid_Century,2g4jby,LFCSS,3,Thu Sep 11 18:24:44 2014 UTC,"Is this lamp the real thing? The seller tells me that it has a Castiglioni badge on the base, but I have done a bit or research and understand that Arco lamps have a high quality marble base with rounded corners, light dimmer (this doesn't) and most important of all: a round hole in the middle to stick a broom handle in and transport it! I love this lamp, I already have a replica snake shaped arch lamp with stone base, totally different, but don't want to pay a steep price for a knock off! Cheers for your feedback :)"
Mid_Century,2g4jby,F-That,3,Thu Sep 11 18:29:29 2014 UTC,"I don't know anything about these lamps but Google image search says you are correct and it is fake. Either way, what is up with that dudes wallpaper?"

I'm wondering what  you guys think of this sofa. Is $475 a deal of should I wait for another one to come along?"
Mid_Century,2g3z02,raanne,5,Thu Sep 11 15:25:23 2014 UTC,"Have you seen the sofa in person? Its a nice style. If the upholstery is good (and what you want) then I would snap it up if you can sit on it with no sagging. Also pick it up and see how heavy it is. How heavy a couch is usually correlates with the quality.   I have reupholstered couches similar to this one, and it isn't that hard. If you are looking to change it though, budget another 100 in materials / fabric + lots of time and see if you still want it for that price."
Mid_Century,2g3z02,lwkane,2,Thu Sep 11 15:56:44 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much raane! I took a couple reupholstery classes years ago. I totally agree with you about the weight being a sign of quality! I have my trusty tools, and learned of a great local fabric source near my new house. The fabric is not my favorite, and I would reupholster it when I have the time. However, the colors sort of work (with where this project is taking me)! The pattern is not at all anything I would choose, but I can live with it. I'm not going to be able to see it for another week. I am keeping my fingers crossed it will still be available then. I sort of doubt it, because it's a good deal. Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out!"
Mid_Century,2g3z02,lwkane,3,Thu Sep 11 17:15:34 2014 UTC,"The drip glaze lamp is awesome! The chair is great as well, even if it is a knock off. If the sofa is in good shape [no sagging underneath, legs aren't cracked and you can reupholster it I would say get it! That's a very good price for it and it can be reupholstered. I paid $550 for my MCM love seat."
Mid_Century,2g3z02,lwkane,3,Thu Sep 11 15:29:54 2014 UTC,"See? I learn something new every day! Thanks so much Iwkane! I never knew the term Drip Glaze! The lamp was $20 the shade needs to be cleaned or replaced, but for now the stain is hiding in the back! When I walked out the door (to pick up the lamp) my husband was not very enthusiastic. However he did an about face, when. Walked in the door with this beauty!"
Mid_Century,2g3z02,Rocknthehawk,3,Thu Sep 11 17:10:29 2014 UTC,"You're very welcome. $20 dollars!! What a steal! A new shade will cost you more than you paid for the lamp. I have been looking for a pair of Blenko Lamps for over a year. They usually sell for around $1,500.00 for the pair. I'll just have to stick with looking at the pictures of them until I can afford to buy them."

Mid_Century,2g0cnu,MercuryChild,1 point,Wed Sep 10 15:10:56 2014 UTC,"Wow, I thought those arms were totally Mid Century. I was thinking of reupholstering it in an orange nubby fabric. I bought in the 90's at an auction. It had been around the block a few times. It had a red velvet fabric that was ver sun faded."
Mid_Century,2g0cnu,MercuryChild,6,Wed Sep 10 15:27:29 2014 UTC,"was it made in the mid century? maybe. Is it modern? nope! That looks more colonial inspired. People don't realized that just because it was made in the 50s and 60s doesn't mean it is mid century modern. But don't get me wrong, it's a nice chair and would look nice reupholstered."
Mid_Century,2g0cnu,MercuryChild,3,Wed Sep 10 16:14:55 2014 UTC,Ahhhhh ha! This chair never sat well with me (no pun intended). I bought it BC it was inexpensive and I needed a chair. It never fit into my old house with the traditional furnishings (because it looked too contemporary). I think the name of the game here is Contemperqry... It is an odd chair with those funky arms. But one day I looked at it and it sort of reminded me of the papa bear chair.No of fence to the super cool Papa Bear Chair intended at all!! Do you think if I change the upholstery it wuold modern her up a bit? Or should I just give it to my nephew and forget it?

Mid_Century,2fvdki,obamapastry,3,Tue Sep 9 23:05:27 2014 UTC,"There appear to be no rips, so I would simply restore. You should be able to find lots of information online by searching out folks who restore old (generally British) sports cars. These folks cherish originality, and have the know-how to restore seats that are in far worse condition. They generally will list their ""go to"" products to treat leather."
Mid_Century,2fum2j,recovercf,3,Mon Sep 8 22:20:46 2014 UTC,"I'm coming up empty in my searches, but it sure is lovely. Where do you keep coming up with all of these beautiful pieces? What area are you from?"
Mid_Century,2fum2j,tallread1,2,Tue Sep 9 17:56:58 2014 UTC,"I'm in California, but I actually found this online, in an East Coast shop, and asked if they'd ship it. I'm not getting it for a bargain but it's a lot less than the shops here would charge for it and it's exactly what I'm looking for.   I found the other two pieces on craigslist.   I moved into an old house that is bigger than the place we previously had so we're trying to furnish it. I've just been spending too much time online trying to find stuff. I'm crossing my fingers for some inexpensive Moller chairs but I think that will take some sort of Mid Century miracle."
Mid_Century,2fum2j,awd3495,3,Tue Sep 9 23:41:31 2014 UTC,It appears to be teak.

Mid_Century,2fvgrk,TheDoug77,4,Tue Sep 9 03:19:55 2014 UTC,Looks like Adrian Pearsall but I cant find one that has that top on it. All I see are glass tops. Super good looking table though.

Mid_Century,2fuq9j,MercuryChild,3,Thu Sep 11 00:57:47 2014 UTC,This is probably from the 70s. But I kind of like it actually. Good buy either way.
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,Woolio,3,Wed Sep 10 17:07:33 2014 UTC,"I like it. I think it holds its own as a piece of decent sculpture. Don't worry about the haters, MCM is a very wide, varied market."
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,__J__A__K__E__,5,Fri Sep 12 03:14:41 2014 UTC,"She cost $120 bucks, but I think it was well worth it! Found it listed as a 1960's table for $1K. I'm planning to love and keep her."
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,OnlySlightlyEvil,4,Mon Sep 8 23:02:23 2014 UTC,I think this table is awesome. Don't listen to the haters.
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,wilse,2,Tue Sep 9 13:14:26 2014 UTC,"Sorry for posting the picture. I found information stating the table was made in the 1960's. Isn't MCM the 50's-70's? I'm confused. Like i said in the past, I'm a newbie to MCM. I will to keep future posts to wooden furniture only. However... One of the first things I learned about MCM was furniture and cabinetry was being made of new materials AND...METAl. After ww2 there was no shortage on metal, as they had saved it for war use. After the war there was metal available and in great supply. My house in NJ was built in 1954 and had metal door frames through out the interior.  Again, I'm sorry and didn't realize this sub was strictly for wooden furniture."
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,wilse,3,Wed Sep 10 04:43:14 2014 UTC,"It's not just for wood furniture. My parents had several chrome MCM pieces when I was growing up. Plus, there's plenty of metal and fiberglass stuff out there, too. I agree the table is most likely from the 70s, but I don't think it's egregiously out of place here."
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,riomx,2,Wed Sep 10 08:37:12 2014 UTC,"This sub is definitely not only for wooden furniture. If you do a simple Google image search for ""mid century glass table"" you will see there are plenty of options, and some of them are actually rather similar to the table you found. We appreciate how much you have been contributing to the sub, and while some people may not like this particular table, I think that is to be expected of any post or any table. âYou can be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world, and there's still going to be somebody who hates peaches.â  There are clearly more people that like this post than dislike it, as evidenced by the number of votes you currently have.

Mid_Century,2fuq9j,wilse,3,Wed Sep 10 14:51:35 2014 UTC,Why did you post this here again?   This isn't MCM.

Mid_Century,2fuq9j,wilse,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:37:22 2014 UTC,Why?
Mid_Century,2fuq9j,riomx,0,Tue Sep 9 17:09:48 2014 UTC,"Because we don't only discuss items that are made from wood and cane here. We've had plenty of discussions about new decor that goes well with vintage decor.  This table is most likely from the 70s and fits well with the decor that marygraces mentioned she wanted to pair up with it. There was a previous discussion that preceded this one, and the post isn't going to be removed."
Mid_Century,2ftfnf,Shakes8993,3,Mon Sep 8 16:04:33 2014 UTC,"Well, I didn't find everything. The vinyl storage piece I picked up in a similar down sizing auction that I got the dressers, that I posted about, in; same auction ""house"", different location. I got that for $40."
Mid_Century,2ftfnf,OnlySlightlyEvil,3,Mon Sep 8 16:07:29 2014 UTC,"My goodness. Fantastic score. It breaks my heart to see such beautiful pieces just discarded like that.   Of course, I'd rather see them discarded than ""refurbished"" with some shitty shabby chic paint treatment."

Mid_Century,2ftfnf,weenur,3,Tue Sep 9 14:33:50 2014 UTC,I took the stereo and speaker components out of my grandparent's hutch style cabinet (it was a mass market Sears model).

Mid_Century,2ftm6f,marygraces,12,Mon Sep 8 17:04:13 2014 UTC,The first one is the coolest IMO.
Mid_Century,2ftm6f,loukall,8,Mon Sep 8 18:39:06 2014 UTC,First one by a long shot. Love the lines and the look. Its awesome. Second one is a steal at 100 buck as well but not as cool looking.
Mid_Century,2ftm6f,DFWPhotoguy,7,Mon Sep 8 18:41:13 2014 UTC,"Well I guess it sort of depends on the condition in person, but $100 for any hutch is probably going to be a good deal. I like the first one, I tend to lean towards more simple, clean designs so it speaks to me a little more. However, the second one might be built with higher quality materials, it looks a little sturdier to me (hard to tell just through the pics though).  So have you been going on a wild buying spree lately? You are all over this sub :)"
Mid_Century,2ftm6f,tallread1,3,Mon Sep 8 18:00:54 2014 UTC,"Yes! I just moved to a new house. It's in a historic district, and need to stay ""historically acute""! I'm going MCM inside and out! I live across the street from a very cool octogon house. My block is all antique ship captains she's with I widows walks. The next newts house n the block is a sweet bungalow. I have the ugly duckling ranch house. Can't wait to get my hads all over this baby! As an Inteior designer I studied antique furniture but the classes never covered after WW2. I graduated from FIT in the early 90. MCM was not hot yet. Honestly, I've fallen in love with this era. It's so nice having the internet and of course Reddit!! Love getting information quickly."
Mid_Century,2ftm6f,Patticat,5,Mon Sep 8 21:29:46 2014 UTC,Lovely.  Why not get both? You can use one for books in a bedroom.  You are so lucky to have a house to furnish.
Mid_Century,2ftl3e,tallread1,3,Mon Sep 8 16:54:20 2014 UTC,"Somewhat related: we have a DUX Credenza that has all the signs of being designed by Folke Ohlsson (drawer pulls, build and door details) however in our research ours appears to be an earlier version.  DUX from what we can tell was one of the few companies who had evolving designs that would slightly change over the years.  Funny enough the chair you have marked as ""Two (gross)"" appears to be the closest in terms of build to the reupholstered chair you found."
Mid_Century,2ftl3e,Hasselbuddy,3,Mon Sep 8 17:14:47 2014 UTC,"I know! The gross comment was mostly due to the weird green lumpy upholstery lol. Although to be honest, it looks pretty comfy...  So that's interesting that they update their designs. I was wondering if that was part of the mystery. I just kept thinking about cars and how newer models can look so different from the previous year. Thanks for the insight!"
Mid_Century,2ftl3e,Hasselbuddy,2,Mon Sep 8 17:55:10 2014 UTC,"No problem. It has made it extremely hard to find more information about our model. It looks 95% the same as versions dated to the 60s, the only difference being the addition of a trim piece on the bottom."
Mid_Century,2ftl3e,F-That,2,Mon Sep 8 18:02:03 2014 UTC,"Stuff like this really makes me wish there was a better source for catalogs, although I totally understand why there's not."
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,Patticat,5,Mon Sep 8 06:16:39 2014 UTC,I have the exact same table. I love it!!!!
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,glasnostic,3,Mon Sep 8 15:28:27 2014 UTC,"Do you sand and I oil it?  The middle section is faded, but the extensions look great."
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,glasnostic,5,Mon Sep 8 20:12:00 2014 UTC,"I have not sanded it but I have applied teak oil. I paid $350 for mine and feel like it was a steal. It's a great table and plenty of my friends are jealous. Heck, I got a compliment on it this past Saturday.   I have some chairs that are a perfect match for it.   Mine gas the same issue with the top a bit faded compared with the leaves. It doesn't bother me much since it stays closed 99 percent of the time."
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,glasnostic,4,Mon Sep 8 20:24:57 2014 UTC,I will try the teak oil.   I love the look of the grain on the extensions and hope to bring it out in the center.  I got some black chairs last week and will pair them with the table.  It will not match but for now it is OK.
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,Shakes8993,3,Tue Sep 9 03:02:01 2014 UTC,Lookup steelwool and wax. That may be the rout you want to go to bring that grain back.
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,riomx,3,Tue Sep 9 15:50:05 2014 UTC,I think steel wool would be safer for me since I do not want to remove too much surface.  Thanks.
Mid_Century,2fsbm5,riomx,3,Wed Sep 10 05:42:54 2014 UTC,I think getting a teak table for $33 is a pretty kick ass deal regardless of the style.
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,espo83,4,Sun Sep 7 21:59:15 2014 UTC,"Found in a thrift for 35 bucks.   Ended up going to my brother in law, Since I live in Illinois and don't have a way to get it home."
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,SwizzleShtick,3,Sun Sep 7 22:25:16 2014 UTC,$35?!?!?!? Wow
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,Woolio,3,Mon Sep 8 03:12:04 2014 UTC,Huh... One of my favorite antique malls was selling a Drexel desk that looked just like this one for $1500. I think you got a good deal.
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,Woolio,4,Sun Sep 7 22:37:04 2014 UTC,Yeah.  Manufacturer is a company called bl marble.  It looks nice and is really well built double slides on all the drawers.  I wouldn't expect to buy the raw materials for that price let alone build a desk this nice.
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,TrevorJordan,1 point,Sun Sep 7 22:43:14 2014 UTC,"Oh no, that's easily $700-800 in raw materials, probably a week or two of work. You couldn't build a better desk for that price."
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,jamwithjelly,2,Sun Sep 7 22:44:51 2014 UTC,How much did you get it for?
Mid_Century,2fr4yc,jamwithjelly,2,Sun Sep 7 22:04:08 2014 UTC,Which thrift store?
Mid_Century,2fovfs,Shakes8993,6,Sun Sep 7 03:15:31 2014 UTC,A little more info.. saw these at a downsizing auction and fell in love with them immediately. Whole house was decorated in this style which I think is mid century but am not sure. I just wanted to confirm for my own info. They are securely in my room and never has opening and closing my drawers been so smooth. Got them for $40 each. Some reason these didn't go up as everyone else wanted the other parts of the rooms and the sofa. I did too and I ended up Dave Hestering them by accident.
Mid_Century,2fovfs,saidthegirl,5,Sun Sep 7 03:19:14 2014 UTC,"Awesome find, awesome price! I would categorize them as MCM."
Mid_Century,2fovfs,raind0gg,3,Sun Sep 7 03:27:23 2014 UTC,These are beautiful pieces and you got them for a steal!
Mid_Century,2fovfs,darryljenks,3,Sun Sep 7 03:31:13 2014 UTC,"I love the second one. Lovely details such as the handles. I would probably remove the mirror, though. It's quite dominating for that size of furniture."
Mid_Century,2fovfs,thecritic06,3,Sun Sep 7 11:24:18 2014 UTC,Some beautiful cabinetry there. I reckon they're pretty definitively MCM.
Mid_Century,2fovfs,marygraces,3,Sun Sep 7 12:55:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the confirmation everyone. You all should have seen the rest of this place. It was like this place was stuck in that time period. Everything was like this in the house, sometimes it was really nice and other times it looked old and worn so I'm sure it was just a homeowner who bought this stuff new and just never re-decorated. I've never seen anything like it since the 80s and visiting my grandparents house."
Mid_Century,2focom,vincent_vancough,2,Sat Sep 6 23:25:31 2014 UTC,"I bought these 4 DCMs a little over a month ago.  They are in need of a little love.  The patina is great, but there is some scuffing and some marks I want to get rid of.  I am looking for advice to remove unwanted marks without ruining the patina.  AKA I really do not want to resort to sanding if I don't have to.  The guy I bought them from is an acquaintance of mine.  I have bought almost all of my MCM items from him (all of which I plan to include in future posts) and he continues to be a good source of knowledge and furniture.  He repairs some wood furniture and he recommended using Laquer Thinner to help with some of those marks, but considering the value of these chairs, I definitely want some second opinions before I commit to any treatments.  I am open to any ideas to restore/improve these chairs."
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,3,Sat Sep 6 23:32:19 2014 UTC,What's the story with the flathead screws on that one?
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,6,Sun Sep 7 00:28:22 2014 UTC,"A lot of idiots don't know how to replace the shock mounts so they drilled through the deteriorating mounts and the back and call it a day.   If you can't tell, I don't abide by butchering furniture for laziness or ignorance."
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,3,Sun Sep 7 02:12:18 2014 UTC,"Hey, neither do I. It's a damn shame when something like that happens to something that can't be replaced. I'm glad a lot of this stuff is finding collectors these days, though, so hopefully this can be avoided in future."
Mid_Century,2focom,jfk_sfa,2,Sun Sep 7 02:20:12 2014 UTC,"The only way to make it right is to re-veneer the back, I have heard Herman Miller will do it. The only problem is that the new veneer would not match the seat. And if you did the both the back and the seat, now it doesn't match the set."
Mid_Century,2focom,tallread1,2,Sun Sep 7 16:10:17 2014 UTC,So what are you going to do about it?
Mid_Century,2focom,Pocanos,2,Sun Sep 7 18:21:49 2014 UTC,"In regards as to how to remove the unwanted marks without sanding, perhaps try a magic eraser in a fairly inconspicuous area to see if that would work. They are surprising abrasive (but not as abrasive as sandpaper obviously) so go light.    I would also simply remove the screws and replace them with wood plugs. Get the right wood in the right shade and you'd be surprised at how close you can match up the grain.    A little stain on the lighter areas that have been worn away to match the color of the rest of the chair would probably help as well."
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,2,Sun Sep 7 05:52:59 2014 UTC,"I have thought of using magic eraser, but the only thing that concerned me about them is that they are supposed to be damp/moist when used. I did not want to damage the wood with water, but perhaps I'm being overly cautious."
Mid_Century,2focom,Pocanos,1 point,Sun Sep 7 11:51:08 2014 UTC,Well you wet them and then wring them out like crazy before using them. The amount of water you would be using is basically negligible.
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,2,Mon Sep 8 15:50:13 2014 UTC,"Also, I really enjoy your idea of wood plugs. I will probably do that when I replace the shock mounts on that one."
Mid_Century,2focom,Pocanos,-2,Sun Sep 7 16:13:08 2014 UTC,Those look incredibly easy to reproduce
Mid_Century,2focom,Woolio,7,Sat Sep 6 23:29:26 2014 UTC,"Molding plywood is really, really difficult. You basically need to build a two-part mold, steam the plywood in a steamer box for a day or so, and then very quickly stick it in the mold, clamp it, and let it dry.  Really, the mold building is the hardest part, although you could presumably make it easier if you had one of these to copy. A concrete mold would probably hold up to the plywood once you clamp it in, might even reduce the need for clamps. The Eameses had the Kazam!, but I don't think someone would go through the trouble of reproducing that.   And, at the end of the day, they're a $400 chair. Why spend 40+ hours and a couple hundred bucks to replicate it when you can just buy the real thing?"
Mid_Century,2focom,Pocanos,-1,Sun Sep 7 00:35:36 2014 UTC,I wouldn't spend 20 dollars on the school chair  Eames looking ones  The luxurious cool lookin eams ones  Thousands of dollars is correct
Mid_Century,2focom,Pocanos,5,Sun Sep 7 00:51:34 2014 UTC,"I have a couple Eames shells made from fiberglass (one armchair, one sidechair), and I love the design of the LCWs, but I've never been a huge fan of the DCMs. They seem a little... Half-baked, I guess.   Then again, they were basically designed to be an affordable chair for offices and schools, so it makes sense.  (The LCW is this chair, but with molded plywood legs. It really makes the design feel sturdier, chunkier, more solid. The DCM is this chair, with the metal legs.)"

Mid_Century,2fhu80,guntop,3,Fri Sep 5 01:26:01 2014 UTC,"The auction was held just outside of Tampa, FL. The Wakefield table had some woodfiller in the legs and someone mentioned possible termite damage? It sold for $100. I purchased all 4 chairs for $50 each and the couch went for somewhere in the $175 range. The couch went last and I had already stretched my budget on the chairs. In hindsight, I probably should have just gone with the couch, but I'm happy with my chairs."
Mid_Century,2fhu80,untbunny,3,Fri Sep 5 03:18:04 2014 UTC,Great deal on the chairs.  The couch at 175 was a great dal also.  Enjoy the chairs and post updates if you rework.

Mid_Century,2fh2ac,FAILING_MISERABLY,2,Thu Sep 4 20:36:41 2014 UTC,I got a set of chairs like these for free and my god do they suck on tile.
Mid_Century,2fdy5f,jfk_sfa,3,Wed Sep 3 20:04:50 2014 UTC,"Picked it up for $20. Sanded the metal and then polished it with a rotary buffer and polishing compound. I then picked up new foam, upholstery, and hardware and recovered it and put it back together. The casters should be in this week.   It was a really fun project. I probably put about 6 hours in it total which was less than I expected. Most of that time was on the sander and buffer."

The chair height and back height are each adjustable along with the back being spring loaded with the ability to adjust the tension of the spring."
Mid_Century,2fdy5f,LFCSS,3,Thu Sep 4 15:55:18 2014 UTC,This has made me less scared of working on metal. Did you notice any metal loss during your process or how did you work to limit it?
Mid_Century,2fdy5f,Barcade,5,Sat Sep 6 21:04:41 2014 UTC,The sanding removed some but mostly just the corrosion. I started with 320 grit and worked up the 600 then buffed it. You can't do too much damage with such a fine grit. You just have to keep it moving and not focus on just one spot for too long.

Mid_Century,2fdqes,Mundus_Vult_Decipi,3,Thu Sep 4 02:27:56 2014 UTC,If it's an original it should be signed somewhere or have a label.  Take a picture of that.
Mid_Century,2fdqes,wirelessengr,2,Wed Sep 3 19:35:45 2014 UTC,"Sigh... I've looked and, nothing.. but I wouldn't put it past my parents or my family to have destroyed the label at some point.  I've been curious to find out if this design is something that was commonly copied, because that would put the issue to rest.  But I feel like even if it's a copy it's still a cool vintage mid-century couch that should be worth more than nothing. Even if it's a fake it's genuinely made out of wood and leather and is definitely old..  One thing that's weird is that the hex screws on the side of it eerily fit a standard Ikea hex wrench. We lived in PA near the first Ikea in the USA in the 80's.. I'm kind of curious if it was a very early model Ikea sofa. Which should make it valuable for other reasons, right? Heh"
Mid_Century,2fdqes,DFWPhotoguy,3,Wed Sep 3 20:59:56 2014 UTC,"Looks like the couch in the blog. Don't know if the genuine thing would have used hex screws, bit Ikea is just metric hex sizes. I don't believe that definitively proves anything about your couch being from Ikea."
Mid_Century,2fdqes,prettyslattern,2,Wed Sep 3 21:36:59 2014 UTC,"Yea I can't find evidence that Ikea ever sold a couch like this, but they have copied other designs from Hans Olsen. Per edit above I think I nailed down what this is ""Hans Olsen for Vatne Mobler"""

I've been doing some digging and it seems like it is a completely original Hans Olsen except for maybe the four seat cushions that look like they were reupholstered or replaced at some time. After seeing the average price of this piece around 2k I would say yours should easily get 1k if you find the right person.  I have a buddy that lives in Williamsburg but there's no way he could come get it since he has no car. Plus his place is so compact I doubt he could hold onto it for me."

Mid_Century,2erl5x,saba1984,7,Wed Aug 27 22:00:33 2014 UTC,"The bit of research I've done on the replicas has provided less than helpful. But I was able to find out some information:  1 - There are three tiers of the chair: * $800 level - poor quality wood and leather, not worth it * $1200 level - often times the same chairs as the $800 level only pricier * $1600 level - high quality wood and leather close to the real deal  2 - All the cheaper chairs are coming from the same factories in China then distributed throughout the states under various brands.  3 - The higher end replicas are made by different factories (still often in China) but can be made in other areas as well.  From the reviews I've read it is simply not worth it to go with the lowest priced models. You'll get a chair that is no better quality than a vintage Plywerk model.  If possible buy local so you can inspect it in person as they will often have marks and dings in the wood. Though this is rarely an option unless you live in a major city (and even then it's not that common)."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Hasselbuddy,7,Wed Aug 27 22:12:52 2014 UTC,"Reposting a previous comment I've made on this topic:   It's tough to say with new reproductions. There are so many new companies that make Eames Lounge knockoffs and they vary in their quality and attention to detail. Those on the low end will have lumpy or cheap cushions, rushed welting, and possibly cheap-looking veneer. Those on the high end will cost more and get very close to the proportions and details of an authentic chair, but they'll still be many times removed in quality from Herman Miller or Vitra.  Many of them use manufacturers based in China, so I've always avoided them. What I can tell you is that LexMod is definitely on the low end. I've read that Rove Concepts and Kardiel use higher-quality materials and people are generally more satisfied with their products. You can read a conversation among people who've bought new reproductions here: http://www.houzz.com/discussions/600714/Best-Eames-Reproduction  Personally, I don't mind vintage reproductions. Though I have a tremendous amount of respect for Charles and Ray Eames and I wish I could buy an authentic Herman Miller chair, I have a myriad number of other priorities that take precedence over my admiration for mid-century furniture. That's why I have always been grateful for vintage reproductions from Plycraft, Selig and Plydesigns, and I'm actually in the process of finishing a restoration on one of the latter.  Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how to spend your money. You could always take a look and see how you think the chair will age with regular use. If you have any reservations, it'd be best to save up for something else.  If you do decide to hold onto your cash, look for a vintage reproduction from the companies I named above. You should be able to find one in the $300-$600 range. I would not pay any more than that, even if you find one that's in excellent condition. Having taken a Plydesigns chair apart (which is extremely close in proportions and appearance to an authentic chair), I can tell you that the components are decent, but not worth the markup from people trying to profit on mid-century furniture demand trends."

Mid_Century,2erl5x,theansweris_fortytwo,2,Fri Jan 30 00:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this will help some of you in a decision. I faced a lot of options when looking for a replica (no way I'm dropping 4500 on a chair I'll hardly sit in at this point) so I ended up going on a hunch and getting the one from MCM classics   Now heres the rub... When the box came in I snapped a pic of the side and did some research to see who was selling what from the same line at different prices. Seems this model gets around. Check out the pics of the box and finished item here.  They are sold by AT LEAST these retailers:   Modway OverStock Amazon (LexMod) NewEgg SleekModernFurniture Modterior Various Ebay sellers   That's just from a search of the product code. Now, look at the pics they are using and compare them to any you are looking at in other places.. guess what, if you overlay them they often match exactly. Sometimes (even with ones I found using the product code) retailers will get clever and take their own pics but occasionally leave in a 'stock' photo from the manufacturer. This is another way you can pick it out. Either way, I think this accounts for the vast majority of the replicas. And the prices range from 899 to 1400 shipped!!   Oh and heres the code: eei-139-blk-pal"

Mid_Century,2erl5x,woodlewaddle,2,Fri Sep 5 03:37:12 2014 UTC,"Me and My wife to redesigned our whole place into a Mid-century modern home. We went to great lengths to choose each piece creating clean lines, open spaces and unfussy design. If you ask me, what the plywood-and-leather jewel in the Mid-century modern homeâs crown is? The Eames Lounge Chair. There is no form over function here; the chair is sumptuous and comfortable, sleek and SEXY. Its seductive. IMO, the chair has come to embody the fundamental design principles of the era. Now, choosing an Eames lounge chair replica can be a daunting task. Trust me. we did a lot of research, our interior designer tried every chair and in the end we settled with Manhattan Home Design's replica. Reason? Thereâs a delight in materials that is obvious when you see an Eames Lounge Chair thatâs meant to both inspire and calm. I found the same delight looking at their replica. The ends those people go to get everything right is impressive and at times shocking. I got the Aniline Leather with Palisander Veneer. Looks amazing. I'll post a few pictures of it soon. http://www.manhattanhomedesign.com/eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman.html"
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Woolio,4,Wed Feb 4 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Eames lounge is probably the only chair I'd actually buy at full price, from Herman Miller. Reason being, it's one of the most knocked-off pieces on the market, just a little behind the Barcelona Chair.   A lot of knockoffs are pretty decent quality depending on what you're buying, but the Eames lounge is different. Nobody gets it quite right. Either the proportions are wrong, or the materials are cheap, or it doesn't sit right, or it falls apart in a year. I don't know of a good manufacturer that makes a perfect reproduction.   So, if you really, really want an Eames lounge, I'd advise just throwing some cash out of your paycheck each month into a sinking fund, and waiting. It'll be so much more worth it when you finally get one, and you won't ever have to feel bad about spending a couple grand on a knockoff.  (A little note about knockoffs, actually. If they do fail, you're usually in a bit of a tight spot. Most don't ship with any sort of warranty or quality guarantee. Herman Miller, however, offers a twelve year warranty for complete replacement, since they're aware the chair does have certain flaws that would warrant such a thing. For instance, the ""wings"" on the back brace can, occasionally, snap clean in half if the rubber shockmount fails. Most knockoffs have the same issue, but they don't acknowledge or cover it.)  Anyway, the chair's only $4500. A knockoff's going to be $1600-1800 if you're lookiing for something decent. If you want good quality, there's really not a reason to not just save up the three grand and buy the real thing."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Suppafly,6,Thu Aug 28 00:16:28 2014 UTC,the chair's only $4500   I figured out who DWR targets with their pricing.
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Woolio,3,Thu Aug 28 05:32:15 2014 UTC,"No, no... Don't get me wrong, I'm a college student who lives on scholarships and loans. However, I've done the math, and I could actually afford an Eames lounge in six months working 40 hours a week at ten bucks an hour, barring any unforeseen expenses. The sinking fund is a wonderful thing.   What I meant by ""only"" is that, unlike a lot of stuff by Aarnio, Saarinen, et al, the Eames lounge is actually affordable by comparison."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,riomx,9,Thu Aug 28 12:28:49 2014 UTC,"I'm a college student who lives on scholarships and loans   After you graduate and your financial commitments and responsibilities expand, you'll see why people hesitate to spent $4,500 on a chair.  The Eames Lounge Chair is (to me, at least) the pinnacle of design, comfort and craftsmanship. But a mortgage, family, pets, cars, child care, monthly bills, etc are a higher priority. So I went and restored an old Plydesigns chair.   All I really wanted was just a comfortable chair. No regrets on not spending the $4,500, which I'd rather save for paying some debts off, home improvement or travel.  EDIT: Forgot to mention -- I also really like having a savings account. Comfort and financial security > Eames Lounge Chair."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Woolio,2,Thu Aug 28 15:59:46 2014 UTC,"Having a savings fund and a sinking fund are not mutually exclusive concepts. In fact, most financial advisors recommend having both, so you don't end up spending your savings on frivolities.   My point is, the $4500 chair is attainable on most budgets, depending on how much you save and for how long. If you only save $20/40 on each paycheck, depending on pay period, you can have one in two years. And, honestly, if it's something that's going to last you a lot longer than most of your other furniture, two years isn't a long time to save.  But I think we need to look at the bigger picture as well. Most people will end up spending several thousand dollars on house furniture. Couches now cost anywhere from a thousand bucks upward. Armchairs are half a grand. Beds are often the cost of an Eames lounge, if not more, depending. If you're going to spend that much on everything else, why not spend that much on a chair that, unlike all your other furniture, isn't going to lose value, isn't going to degrade as quickly, and is going to be one of the most comfortable pieces of furniture in your house?   Although, I will say that most people use credit to purchase furniture... Which is arguably less painful until you start getting the bills. But that's why we have sinking funds, where we can slowly save up for the things we want while keeping our other finances in check.   Personally, I'm already halfway to one, and I'm a college sophomore who has his finances in check. And I'm not immune to personal finance issues, same as you. I'm planning to buy it as a graduation present to myself. If I can do that on a student's budget, what's stopping anyone else, other than just wanting to spend everything they're not saving or is otherwise pre-assigned?"
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Rocknthehawk,3,Thu Aug 28 16:21:29 2014 UTC,"I won't argue the cost of furniture- I work as an upholsterer and build furniture for a living.  Quality pieces are expensive. If you have your heart set on buying an Eames chair, I wouldn't sink $4500 into a brand new one hoping it holds its value (who knows, maybe the market will stay strong on original examples.) You can find a used piece for a little more than half the new price."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,riomx,4,Thu Aug 28 21:15:15 2014 UTC,"If I can do that on a student's budget, what's stopping anyone else, other than just wanting to spend everything they're not saving or is otherwise pre-assigned?   The simple answer is that not everyone wants a $4,500 chair. And not everyone cares about furniture losing value. I have no emotional or financial motivation to have furniture that is valuable and I can resell at high value.   It just doesn't matter to me. I also have pets and children, so it makes almost zero sense for me to have expensive furniture that is an investment, at least until my kids are off to college and my pets long gone.  Also, your assumption that people want to spend all the money they're not saving is hilarious. Do you really honestly think that's the case? Life happens and the money you earn is there to help you through challenges. That doesn't mean anyone that spends on anything other than a $4,500 chair is being frivolous and wasteful."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Woolio,2,Thu Aug 28 16:33:07 2014 UTC,"I know what my friends and family do. You might be a different case. Mine may not be representative of everyone's situation. Your mileage may vary. And that's fine.  But your reasons are your own, mine are my own. An Eames lounge makes sense for people who want it, and care enough about furniture to buy it. You might be perfectly happy with your chair, and that's wonderful, but that doesn't translate to everyone. Some people might prefer the accuracy or quality of the real thing, and that's why I recommend it.   Honestly, I stand by what I've said. If you want an Eames Lounge, either for the historical or monetary value, buy the Eames Lounge. If you want something of a little lower quality that looks like it, buy a knockoff. Just know the risks and trades you make before you do.   Whatever the situation, it's $40 a month for two years. Whether or not that makes sense to you is your own decision."

Mid_Century,2erl5x,riomx,1 point,Mon Jan 5 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"My favorite aspect of your attitude and the way you communicate is that you gloss over your own decisions and pass judgment on others.  It's especially funny that you question why other people don't save to spend on an authentic Eames Lounge Chair when you've stated that you ""live on scholarships and loans,"" and think that people are wanting ""just to spend everything they're not saving.""  Shouldn't you be prioritizing repayment of school loans instead of spending on a luxury item? Why is it that you are in a position where you have to take loans to finance your education? Did your parents spend on other things when they could have been saving for your education?  So many questions and interesting possibilities! The reality is that we all make personal choices and it isn't anyone else's business as to why, and it's especially stupid to pass judgment on others especially when you make questionable choices of your own."
Mid_Century,2erl5x,Woolio,2,Thu Aug 28 20:20:43 2014 UTC,"Like I said, I have my finances in check. I've taken out two loans, about five grand in total, which I'm using as overflow. I've actually managed to keep the full value of both loans in savings, I haven't actually spent any of them. ""Surviving"" may have been an overstatement.   But I can see we're not going to reach an agreement, so I'm going to call it here and walk away.

When I came over for a BBQ and saw it sitting in the garbage, I thought it looked familiar, so i took it out and told them never to throw out anything old without consulting me first. I thought it looked a lot like a Marcel Breuer Bauhaus design, and thought I would come here to see if I was right. I know its old, because my grandparents are old, so I think its the real deal, but there doesn't seem to be any markings on it. Is it still worth anything, or even worth keeping with the ripped seat?

Mid_Century,2elcwl,brass_and_rosewood,3,Tue Aug 26 03:07:54 2014 UTC,"It is the Marcel Breuer B5 chair. Or at least is it supposed to be. The trouble is that almost all of Breuer's designs have been in constant production for the past 80+ years. This means that there are hundreds of thousands or probably multi-millions of these units out in the world so they are not rare. The other issue is that the design lost it's design patent protection more than 50 years ago so there are decades of unauthorized look-a-like chairs out there too.  This is just a guess, but, even if that chair is a fairly old one, it would be cheaper to buy a replacement one than to have that one sewn back together by a professional seamster."

But for lovers of MCM, it's just out of character with the design aesthetic that we seem to be drawn to.  My husband and I just bought a mid century ranch and I've been trying to fill it with true-to-period pieces. My husband, however, grew up on a farm and prefers more rustic/primitive/reclaimed pieces. This style combines both so seamlessly (and we've been struggling to find pieces that do that)."

The term, employed as a style descriptor as early as the mid-1950s, was reaffirmed in 1983 by Cara Greenberg in the title of her book, Mid-Century Modern: Furniture of the 1950s (Random House), celebrating the style that is now recognized by scholars and museums worldwide as a significant design movement.

Mid_Century,2ebehg,riomx,4,Fri Aug 22 21:55:37 2014 UTC,Did you have to do any sewing on that vinyl?  I just bought a leather lounger that I really need to recover but the cushions are sewn (almost like couch cushions that sit on the frame of the chair) but am a bit scared as I've never covered anything with vinyl before.  That looks great by the way!
Mid_Century,2ebehg,Cat_Chat_Roulette,3,Fri Aug 22 22:34:01 2014 UTC,"We had to sew the welting for the cushions. Oftentimes they are attached to the cushions themselves, but I stapled them to the edges of the wood frames. This is better because if you ever rip a cushion, you don't have to reattach the welting to cushions, and just replace the fabric for the cushions instead.  Sewing takes a bit of a learning curve, but my wife and I found YouTube videos very helpful. Once you understand how to set up and use your machine, and know which feet you need to use for specific jobs, it'll click and you won't feel as scared.  Here's an example of a welting instruction video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjG3LsDZeIw"
Mid_Century,2ebehg,Cat_Chat_Roulette,3,Fri Aug 22 22:46:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah the welting on yours looks really well done. I do a lot of sewing (but have done very little upholstering) and the welting seems similar to sewing on piping (which is never easy for me).  The lounger I bought seems fairly easy to recover, so I might make cloth covers for it now and then when I'm feeling up for the challenge remake them in vinyl or leather.  Thanks for the advice!"
Mid_Century,2ebehg,Cat_Chat_Roulette,3,Sat Aug 23 02:45:23 2014 UTC,No problem. Happy to help with info anytime.
Mid_Century,2ebehg,mathis007,3,Sat Aug 23 02:57:01 2014 UTC,BTW I didn't realize you had experience with sewing. I checked out your posts in sewing and you've made some cool stuff! You should have a way easier transition to upholstery than I did. All I ever did was hand sewing.
Mid_Century,2ebehg,tallread1,3,Sat Aug 23 15:48:38 2014 UTC,Thanks!  I've recovered exactly one thing (an ikea chair) so I'm looking forward to the challenge.
Mid_Century,2ebehg,Hasselbuddy,3,Sun Aug 24 06:37:56 2014 UTC,"Also, I forgot to mention that the cushions themselves are not sewn -- they're pulled and stapled, which is a common technique for upholstery.  It just takes a bit of time and patience to learn. If you move too quickly and don't correct mistakes, your chair can end up looking loose in places like this:   http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7MQzkekUz1M/Sxxt0QgeENI/AAAAAAAAAGs/xC2N-yhG1yw/S660/DSC00338.JPG  http://the818.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/The-Chair.png"
Mid_Century,2ebehg,grouch1980,3,Fri Aug 22 23:34:44 2014 UTC,"I picked up this chair for $100 last October. I'd been looking for an Eames Lounge Chair reproduction for 3 years and finally found one! But someone bought it before I could. Well, as luck would have it, the buyer's wife saw how rough it was and ordered him to sell it. The original seller provided my number and the buyer called me. A few hours later, it was mine.  It smelled awful and had obviously been a smoker's chair and had been stored in a basement or something. Nevertheless, I was up for the challenge and set out to refinish and reupholster it.  I disassembled and cleaned all parts. I sanded and removed the old dye and lacquer finish. I removed and threw away all of the old vinyl and batting (but not before making templates for the new vinyl).  I refinished it with Danish oil and polyurethane, and reupholstered it with new batting and vinyl. Due to cost, I didn't replace the cushions this time, but I will reupholster it again in leather in the future and replace them. I did all cushions and buttons, but I outsourced the armrests to a local upholsterer since I began a new job and it'd been about 5 months without any time to do them. I just wanted to see it complete!  I documented the whole process with high quality photos of every step that I plan to publish on a new blog for my projects. However, in the meantime, I figured I'd share some before and after photos."

I can't wait to see your blog post about this project. I've been looking for a tutorial on how to restore a chair like this. Please keep us posted OP! looks great!

Mid_Century,2ecb8z,brass_and_rosewood,2,Sat Aug 23 17:25:33 2014 UTC,"I don't really think it is worth much. You might be able to sell it for $100 to some college students who need a cheap sofa for a dorm house or something but it isn't a collectable piece. Yes, it is probably from the 1960's or 1970's (the middle of the century) but it is not in the ""mid-century modern"" style that we collect here in this subreddit. As a rule of thumb anything ornate and tufted isn't modernist. I hope this is helpful!"

Mid_Century,2ecb8z,ayek8,4,Sat Aug 23 05:59:49 2014 UTC,"looks like Hollywood regency style, in my opinion.   I wouldn't say it's worthless. The fact it's a corner/curved couch is great. I always am on the hunt for curved couches, as they are quite difficult to find. I like yours quite a bit, actually! A boutique might want to purchase it, since it's a rather mild color and the style looks quite victorian inspired. Really it's a great piece.  Don't under price it, - especially if it's in good condition!"
Mid_Century,2ecb8z,joefxd,3,Sat Aug 23 13:48:58 2014 UTC,"If you're still having trouble finding that rounded tufted sofa, I heard there's one company left in the US that still makes curved couches like this.

Mid_Century,2eapez,fgunthar,6,Fri Aug 22 17:59:44 2014 UTC,"There are lot of knockoff and reproduction Barcelona Chairs out there. I'd be hesitant to buy it unless I saw it in person to verify that it was authentic.   If it is authentic, you could probably sell it on Etsy. I've sold some MCM pieces on there before, and they went pretty quickly."
Mid_Century,2eapez,lagirl24,4,Fri Aug 22 19:56:47 2014 UTC,"To give you the best advice, we will likely need to see some photos of the exact chair you are interested in purchasing; to verify authenticity and perhaps estimate the condition and era of manufacture.  Selling can also be a challenge, depending on your location, or what outlets you have available to you.  (local market, dealers, auction houses, etc)"
Mid_Century,2eapez,ronisolomondds,3,Fri Aug 22 18:56:24 2014 UTC,"I would pass on it, and here's why. The Barcelona Chair is one of the MOST knocked off pieces of vintage furniture. This makes it very hard to authenticate and even harder to sell. Sure, some places have high asking prices, but you have no idea how many people are actually willing to pay $8K for an authentic chair. How many of those chairs have been sold by Hive? 1 a year? 5 a year? I doubt it's much more than that. Most people who want a Barcelona Chair, cannot afford an authentic piece and are more than happy to buy knock-offs. Those who can afford them, finding those people is going to be a challenge. A few thousand would be a great deal if you knew it was authentic and planned to keep it for yourself. It's not a great deal if you have to keep it for years before finding the right buyer, as your money is then tied up into a piece of furniture that is just sitting under a sheet."

I haven't seen a fake one that went into that much detail so if it has that chances are you're good."
Mid_Century,2eapez,manberdo,1 point,Sat Aug 23 00:31:28 2014 UTC,Measure it. Knock offs won't have the exact measurements because they can't. Unless you suspect it's not just a knock off but a forgery.   Do the cushions have a knoll tag?  Is it very old? Chrome is a recent material. If it's unstamped then it should be stainless steel.   Call Knoll Studio and ask to speak to a studio rep and ask for advice.

First thing - ID that artist. You don't want to find out a year from now that you screwed up a ten thousand dollar painting.  Next, if it's oil on canvas, the easiest thing to use is alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Sounds weird but it really works on tobacco stains. I used about half a jar on the painting I refurbed. Just keep pouring and wiping gently with paper towels until the crap is going.  This is going to stink, by the way. Do it outside.   If it isn't oil, or you don't know, you shouldn't touch it with any liquid. Acrylic or latex based paints should be safe enough to work with, though."
Mid_Century,2e8ji8,cjbest,3,Fri Aug 22 17:38:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info! The person at the auction didn't know anything about the painting other than it came from a house in upstate NY, and the only other markings is this (signature?) on the back of the canvas.   http://imgur.com/cdwq6mP  I'm guessing it's acrylic.

Mid_Century,2e8ji8,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Fri Aug 22 19:12:02 2014 UTC,"Just curious- can you tell just by looking at it if it's oil or acrylic? I'm an artist who's painted with both, and I still can't figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
Mid_Century,2e8ji8,cjbest,2,Sat Aug 23 06:11:30 2014 UTC,I can tell by the texture and brush stroke quality. Oil is thicker and is usually pretty obvious. Acrylics are smoother and the colour depth is not the same.
Mid_Century,2e8ji8,OnlySlightlyEvil,2,Sat Aug 23 12:14:44 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, that doesn't help me much.   I actually have both oil and acrylic paintings that I have done, and they look the same to me.   I guess I just need someone to be here with me to point out the differences.  : /"

Mid_Century,2e44dg,tallread1,9,Thu Aug 21 00:50:00 2014 UTC,"This set is American of Martinsville and was sold to me for $250 total (and the price of a uhaul van, since the china cabinet wouldn't fit in a pickup).  Couldn't believe my luck!"
Mid_Century,2e44dg,mirthquake,4,Wed Aug 20 20:23:07 2014 UTC,"Amazing! What keywords did you use to find this on CL? I feel like I never find these gems because I'm using keywords like ""mid century modern"" or ""space age"" and clearly some of the people selling this stuff don't realize what they have."
Mid_Century,2e44dg,Nieros,6,Wed Aug 20 21:07:32 2014 UTC,"In this case, I've been on the hunt for a sideboard (didn't reeaally need a china cabinet, but who could refuse the $250 pricetag and keeping them together?) and would check a couple times a week for ""sideboard,"" ""buffet,"" and even ""dresser"" wondering if people would label something wrong.  I often look for just one item at a time like ""chair"" or ""dresser"" or ""table"" - so that I'm not just sifting through the furniture or antique sections (although I often do that too).    This method obviously gives you a lot of results - but that's how I've found a couple gems!"
Mid_Century,2e44dg,missfittnc,3,Wed Aug 20 23:13:08 2014 UTC,"Most of the time you have to look through every listing because people will have them listed as ""wood table"" or ""chair"". I don't have the time for that though, so I usually search for things like vintage, retro, old, 1960, 60s, wood, etc. You still have to pick through a lot of crap, but it narrows it down considerably. You might also want to consider searching for misspellings of specific names."
Mid_Century,2e44dg,ayek8,2,Wed Aug 20 21:48:44 2014 UTC,"I just saw this comment and have some tips that I think you'll find useful. I bought this EXACT same hutch last week, posted about it here, and was told to look at this thread, so I think that you and I have similar taste.  First of all, I strongly recommend using the Craigslist smartphone app instead of the website. The app allows you to search multiple regions at once and is more navigable, simpler, and quicker to use.   As for keywords, you are absolutely right about people not knowing how to properly describe their items. This makes things harder to find, but when you do find a hidden treasure it is often much cheaper than items listed under ""proper"" jargon. Who do you think will ask for more money; someone who lists a ""Danish Modern mid century teak hutch and sideboard by Frank Green"" or someone who posts the same items as ""Old furniture set""?   Always the first person, because they're informed or have taken the time to find out what they have. They've identified good search terms to include in their listing title, so they're probably aware of their pieces' value, the importance of age and materials, perhaps the maker, and are certainly aware that Mid Century is a red hot trend right now. Sometimes these items are posted by dealers or experts. The second person doesn't know these things, and sees what most people see--used furniture. They're not an expert and probably don't know that their furniture is even worth taking the time to learn about. It's the second person I look for.  Here are search terms that help me find them (in combination with words like ""chair,"" ""table,"" ""lamp,"" etc.): - Midcentury, Mid-century, midcentury, mid-century, mcm - sputnik (often refers to atomic/space age design in lighting) - teak - retro - vintage - industrial - used furniture - old furniture - groovy, funky, cool, far out, wild, unique (these are some of the of adjectives commonly used by a layperson to describe stylish retro design. There are more; be creative. Try to think like Mom or like your least stylish friend who is simply trying to make some quick cash online by selling something they don't care about) - chrome - fiberglass, spun fiberglass - vinyl - leather - Lucite - Bakelite - Naugahyde  - oak - tubular steel - glass and wood, chrome and vinyl, chrome and leather, glass and leather, steel and glass, etc. - hard wood/bent wood/bentwood/tropical wood - stylish/hip/chic/sleek/dapper/upscale/trendy/snazzy/luxury/ - case piece - curio - patina - ergonomic - design - tulip chair, shell chair, cone chair, egg chair, lounge chair, Z chair, Cesca, cantilever, heart chair, Wassilly, Barcelona chair, task chair, office chair, desk chair, dining chair, kitchen chair,  - sunrise, sunburst, starburst, moon - sofa, settee, daybed, loveseat - 1940s, 1950s, 1960s - forties, fifties, sixties - retro, vintage, second hand, old fashioned, nostalgic, grandma/pa, dad/mom - angular/geometric - atomic, atomic-style - space, space-age, space race, moon landing, Kubrick - modern, moderne, modernist, modernistic post modern, post-modern, postmodern, - post-war, post war, inter war, interwar, ww2, wwii - lounge, office, patio, library, beach house (think practical locations for objects) - streamline/streamlined - world's fair, world fair - Memphis - Empire - Googie - Mod - Edo, Japanism, Oriental, Eastern, Japanese, Asian,  - Ranch, atomic ranch - Eames, Eames era - California, California modern - Minimalist - De Stijl - Nouveau - Jugendstil - Populuxe - Bauhaus - Regency - Futurist - Brutaliast - Soviet/Cold War - Mad Men - Curve/curvature - FDR, Roosevelt, JFK, Kennedy, LBJ, Lindon, Harry Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Reagan (people tend to miscalculate the age of old things, especially when those things are in good condition. I've found things listed as ""from the 1980s"" that were 50s/60s) - Deco, art deco (some people think ""Deco"" refers to anything old and cool looking) - European, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, French, Italian, English, American, Canadian, German, etc. - Identify companies/designers you like and search by their names. My go-to searches include Howell, Loewy, Noguchi, Shaw-Walker, Pearsall, Eero, Saarinen, Panton, Baughman, Steelcase, van der Rohe, Hermann Miller, Burke, Craft, Knoll, Jaymar, Kimball, Luminaire, Intertek, McCobb, Bertoia, Wegner, Frank Lloyd Wright, Corbusier, Gropius, Hoffmann, Jacobson, Arne, Georg Jensen, Hans Wegner, Finn Juhl, Thonet, Breuer, AEG, Peter Behrins, Koenig, Smilow Also, search in the ""free"" category. Check it as often as you can. It's mostly crap, but sometimes people really want to get rid of some very nice things.  I check multiple times a day. I don't buy much, but when an exciting and cheap new listing appears I try to be on the phone with the seller as quickly as possible. Try misspelling words or getting creative in other ways. Try to think like someone who knows nothing about vintage things and doesn't care at all, and imagine the phrasing they'd use to describe the furniture of your dreams.  Have fun!"

Mid_Century,2e52rq,ricknhsv,1 point,Thu Aug 21 01:55:27 2014 UTC,I got it a a church yard sale for $5. Is it a mushroom lamp? The shade is white plastic that slips over the white glass shade that surrounds the light bulb.
