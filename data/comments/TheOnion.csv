Im basing that on a feeling, not just any feeling; a really strong feeling. I also have a strong feeling that anyone who disagrees with me is clearly a communist and obviously hates America, and Nitrogen!"

TheOnion,3dyh5k,SpecialRX,8,Tue Jul 21 23:47:33 2015 UTC,remember when the onion said fuck it and stopped printing?

TheOnion,3dfe80,redditmortis,13,Wed Jul 15 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"Sources confirmed a separate donation has also been made to provide a safe space and counseling services for straight white men at the college who won’t shut the fuck up about how they’re the real victims on campus these days   Is it just me or does this last bit seem totally at odds with the rest of the piece? They spend the first 90% seemingly bashing the hypersensitivity of so-called SJWs who claim PTSD at a drop of a hat, and then, apparently, try to paint MRAs as being that stereotype instead. I hate both of those extremes, but it seems like the writer didn't know how to differentiate between the two."
TheOnion,3dfe80,haltenthousand,12,Wed Jul 15 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"That's the point imo. I don't think the Onion wants to come off as ""pro-SJW"" or ""anti-SJW,"" they're just making fun of everybody involved."
TheOnion,3dfe80,seshfan,10,Wed Jul 15 21:53:52 2015 UTC,That's the impression I had gotten as well. I believe the best satire mocks both sides of an issue.
TheOnion,3dfe80,haltenthousand,3,Wed Jul 15 22:39:48 2015 UTC,Okay :) I was hoping that was the case. I think The Onion's best articles are the ones that don't push an agenda and just poke fun at everyone.
TheOnion,3dfe80,lowbrow_name,3,Wed Jul 15 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"it seems like the writer didn't know how to differentiate between the two.   One is ridiculous, the other is even more ridiculous."
TheOnion,3dfe80,SoMuchNot,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"Just good writing. Once you think nothing could get funnier than SJW ""triggering"" and PTSD-induction, the MRAs show up."
TheOnion,3d0sn2,fakeshits,3,Sun Jul 12 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"Although I do like this comic and understand what it's saying, I have never understood the worshipping of the flag we see happen. It's just the flag. We don't have an issue with burning the flag or symbols of other nations. We say that freedom of speech is one of the most important rights of the US, so people can use the flag either way, because of that right."
