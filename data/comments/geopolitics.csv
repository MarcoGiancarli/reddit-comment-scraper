We're a very decentralized country held together by massive transfer payments from haves to have nots.

I also do not see why transfer payments will magically become a destabilizing issue for some reason in the next couple of decades when it really hasn't been more than something a few people grumble about. Canada has an exceptionally strong union and I really do not see any evidence of that changing any time soon."

Our only way to retain a voice internationally is as a single government. Individually countries like Italy, Spain, Belgium, Ireland have little to no say in the International order, but a single EU-wide government would.   European Union as one government would be the largest economy in the world. Decision-making under an actual government would be a lot more democratic than the current system.   To see the problem just look at Merkel. She has become the de facto leader of EU decision-making. However as Chancellor of Germany she has to put German interests first, leading to a dual role and conflict of interests."

Maybe, but I'm not sure that the history of the EU should leave us optimistic here. A truly representative and democratic EU would (by necessity) look an awful lot like a United States of Europe, and I don't see powerful states like France or Germany willingly relinquishing their present influence. I mean, there's what Hollande is saying what right, but politicians get away with a lot of aspirational statements like this when they know they'll never have to deliver on them.  For what it's worth I agree entirely that European nations are increasingly going to be Kibbles-N-Bits in the international order versus megastates like the U.S. and China (Russia absent a de-Putinification is going to be an also-ran, India is too chaotic to predict), but ... I don't know. A truly unified Europe means that the French farm lobby gets a healthy and well-deserved smack in favor of a more equal subsidy system. (This should happen, but won't.) A truly unified Europe means that Germany can be outvoted on the subject of Greek debt forgiveness. (This should happen, but won't.) A truly unified Europe means that each state, including the most powerful, loses the ability to set its own economic and foreign policy, and Europe is already a basket case on all of this.  A joke that gets passed around economists' circles a lot is that the EU mostly consists of France spending Germany's money. For better or worse, I'm not sure there's much about the current path that's likely to change that."

geopolitics,3e1y9i,yaix,4,Tue Jul 21 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"In theory, it is the best resolution that the euro group (EG from now on) could take. On the field, is nearly impossible: as in politics and from both an economical and social point of view.  From a political point of view,  a EG government without the UK would not have as much power as with it, and probably would be hugely one-sided for Germany (like the EU nowadays, but more powerful).  Economics: the EG would be now forced to take every debt, and turn it on her own debt, thus becoming one really indebted government. Not only Greece, but also Spain, Portugal and Italy, which can't be kicked out of it. On the other hand, development all across the EG is highly unequal, which should be corrected in order to move as a whole. This is, nowadays, fought by giving loans from the ECB. In a Euro government, there are no more loans, only expenses. It would compromise the whole government. It would be needed, as well, to reform the help the government gives to the different economic fields, and the way is given too. French's agriculture is hugely helped by the state, in a way that a larger territory couldn't make it. Furthermore, there is a technological difference between French's agriculture and eastern Europe's one, which would have to be dealt with. More expenses for hugely in-debt government.  Socials: The EG is hugely different from the US, meaning that the US has a common history and is well joined in terms of culture. The EG, on the other hand, has different languages, a different history and the cultures are far from being the same. In the US, every 4th of July, people all around the 50 states celebrate, because they feel as one, as if the freedom of the 13th original states is their own, too. That can't happen in the EG because simply people won't celebrate the 14th of July in Germany. People in Greece will feel, as they do now, that their concerns are not taken seriously in Bruxelles, and most of the people in Spain won't care if something happens in Lithuania. Simply, it would be so regionally-closed, socially, that one government won't be able to handle it."

And with the Spain thing, I mean that there isn't really an European feeling, as oppose in the US, where a guy in Florida and a guy in Minnesota both are going to say they are from the US.

Both the U.S. and Iran could not afford to fail since failure meant war.   WTF? The US and Iran have never been at war, and are not on the cusp of war if this agreement falls thru.  This kind of absurd sensationalism gets accepted as fact for some reason.   That’s not a moral consideration but a practical one: both are stretched too thin to fight one another directly.   There is no country on earth that the US is ""stretched too thin"" to go to war with. Again, an assertion of absurd notions as if they are fact...  Kind of like the entire ""agreement""...

NATO could decide to bolster Estonia's defenses with material and personal (like they are doing now, just on a larger scale), which would make the Russian strategy of using a paramilitary group as a front untenable, because it would be unable to hold its own without obvious logistics and air support from Russia...which would at that point make the conflict an obvious regular invasion by Russia.  The 'little green men' would therefore be seriously outgunned and would have to jump back across the border - not much fighting, if any, would happen before Putin would realise this.

In particular, LGM in Estonia are only going to have tanks if Russia provides them.

Estonia would maybe leave NATO, but I don't think that the stronger NATO allies would have much incentive to leave.   In short: it's difficult to imagine an Estonian exit from NATO heralding the end of the treaty organization. And it's harder to imagine NATO forces threatening nuclear war for Estonia's sake, regardless of what the defense agreement with Estonia may stipulate.  Editing with what seems like the likeliest scenario, should Putin send green men to Estonia: eastern portions of the country would likely try to split away, as we saw happen in Ukraine with Donetsk.

What people don't seem to understand is that you can't just do something like that because that would mean Russia could get almost anything it wanted, all it has to do is threaten nuclear war. Furthermore your credibility is lost at that point.  THE WHOLE POINT of a nuclear war and MAD is based on the idea that if you fire nukes I will fire nukes. If one side is not willing to do it the you might as well not have them. That's how we averted firing nukes in the cold war and that's why each side were afraid to use them."

I'm talking about if Putin waged another proxy war while denying culpability, like he did in Ukraine. It's an entirely different situation than what concepts like MAD would apply to.   Edit: keeping this post as is, but there's a typo in the above. I meant  'MAD and nuclear deterrence are relevant in the case of threats made by Russia [...]'.

It's very difficult to imagine Putin making such moves towards the brink over a low-intensity conflict in the Baltic. Do you see what I mean?   Putin's men have come out and said he considered nuclear options during the siege of Crimea, which is certainly a reckless and atrocious line of rhetoric. But they were careful to come out with that over a year after the crisis itself. Putin wants to seem strong to his own people, but (as far as I'm aware) he's made no real threats of using nuclear weapons."

If it starts selectively ignoring them, I guess because apparently Estonia isn't worth it for some reason, that sends doubt to rest of the members.

Poland certainly would; they've been betrayed enough to see whats coming.

Intervening militarily on behalf of a small state like Estonia is likely to draw the other border states into the conflict. I think it ends up with a situation where everyone ends up deciding ""Better them than me"". A weakened NATO is still better than no NATO at all.

A NATO response to a Russian attack on Estonia may or may not get German public support, depending on the circumstances surrounding the attack and the level of the response.  Second, whether the German public supports NATO is not the immediate issue. Germany's government may comply with NATO treaty obligations even if compliance is unpopular.  If Germany's government refuses to comply, the country would likely be removed from NATO, but such a hypothetical isn't enough of a reason for Germany to be removed preemptively."

They are wiling to use tactical nuclear weapons to destroy conventional forces to blunt any overwhelming conventional attack, and since the Russians are much, much weaker even in the face of their modernization from a conventional standpoint versus the US, the bar for using nuclear weapons is incredibly low in their view.  The distance between the baltics and moscow is only a couple hundred miles, the line in their own doctrine for what defines a ""threat"" is ambiguous at best.

Russia would be forever ostracized (if the world isn't ultimately destroyed...) for using a tactical nuclear weapon. That's assuming that a conflict would ever escalate to the point of a conventional conflict between NATO and Russia.   A lot has happened in the seventy years since World War II, the Cold War, and the fall of the Wall, but a direct conflict between the West and Russia would have to be predicated on some form of serious conflict. Russia, nor the West, would risk a war over Estonia. Russia may find openings in Estonian domestic politics, similar to the Ukrainian situation, but pushing it to the point of a NATO force near the Russian border? It seems unwise for Russia, as NATO/the West could (nuclear weapons aside) substantially weaken Russia before it even got to that point. Look at the effect of the sanctions post-Crimea."

Schelling's idea was that no sane person would willingly cause the Apocalypse, and so for a nuclear threat to remain credible, you had to set it up such that it could be triggered without the consent of a politician.  Nuclear war is a very real threat to humanity, and the conflict that it's likeliest to stem from is probably the ongoing Kashmir dispute, between India and Pakistan. It's a hot conflict, if one that the western media doesn't pay much attention to.  The conflict is really complex, but, boiling it down: it's asymmetrical warfare. To Pakistan, India looks like a massive hegemon. To fight it, Pakistan's ISI has allowed terrorist organizations (perhaps most notably LeT) to act with relative impunity, both in the Kashmir and against India. Conspiracy theories are abundant, even in the stuff available on Jstor.  Along with all the obvious problems this poses, another one is the possibility of Pakistani nukes getting into the hands of terrorists. We've seen nuclear technology sold on the black market before, through Pakistan -- AQ Khan's network famously supplied Iran with the beginnings of their program.  Along with that, India and Pakistan face the very real possibility of escalation in the Kashmir. They're the only two nuclear states to have warred against each other directly, in spite of the risks of nuclear war that that posed. What that heralds for the next century isn't promising."
geopolitics,3dxfb8,krosork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"India and Pakistan are both proud and modern nations with international connections and both have extensive diasporas and expatriate communities, who in turn exert influence on their home nations. Even if nuclear actions did achieve the desired outcomes, the international political and social communities would be so outraged that the repercussions to trade and reputation would be catastrophic.   Such notoriety might be of benefit to a nihilistic extremist group, but for a modern nation to undertake, it would no doubt be construed as cowardly and barbaric acts... particularly for such a gain."

While the possibility of a nuclear exchange remains between India and Pakistan - the chances are low.  Simply because every single major war they've fought was  before both of them joined the nuclear club.  Since their declaration in 1998, both of them have  fought  relatively low level skirmishes.  Nuclear deterrence is what's going to keep them from escalating a direct skirmish into a full blown nuclear exchange. No country wants to preemptively nuke another nation that also has nuclear weapons. It would be suicidal."

Keep in mind that if Putin or the Muscovites actually directly or legitimately threaten using nuclear weapons then NATO, the EU, and even the UN and Chinese are going to look at Muscovy as a colossal apocalyptic peril to the world and major operations at regime change are going to start getting put into operation."
geopolitics,3dxfb8,nordasaur,6,Mon Jul 20 11:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that that's true. Members of Putin's cabinet have openly claimed that the nuclear option was on the table during the incident in Crimea; it's hard to imagine their rhetoric getting much more bellicose than that.  I have no intentions of legitimizing Putin or embracing his (false) narratives with regards to uprisings in Ukraine. He's an illiberal brute. That said, I think that the cold truth is that the major NATO powers would be willing to cede Estonian territory to Putin, if the only clear alternative was a conventional war with Russia. It would scare the other Baltic members, as well as Poland, and for that reason, it's clearly not a desirable choice -- but it's hard to imagine NATO falling apart because it failed to honor an agreement with Estonia.  That said, I really do think that that's unlikely. Were Putin to try to pull a Ukraine-style takeover of NATO turf in the Baltic, I think a likely outcome would be a proxy war. The end of which, as I stated previously, would I think look something like the situation in Donetsk, with the foundation of a nominally independent republic on the eastern side of the country, with strong cultural ties to Russia.  So much of what seems to have happened in Ukraine, though, was unique to that country. Putin was acting in response to a pro-EU revolution in Ukraine, whereas the Estonians by and large seem quite happy with EU membership. This matters because, in the eyes of some Ukrainians, the 'green men' served a legitimate purpose: that is, keeping them away from Europe. Hard to imagine the same legitimizing factor being present in a state which has been tied to the EU for over a decade.  I hope this is a coherent reply.

geopolitics,3dxfb8,krosork,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:15 2015 UTC,The real question is would a conflict in the Baltics even get close to a nuclear war.  Considering the typical hybrid war I doubt the US or Russians would consider launching nuclear weapons over low intensity conflict.  And if it did come close to nuclear war we might see more sanctions on the Russians and the Chinese might break off relations with the Russians and we might see major work done towards regime change with even the Chinese possibly involved.

North Korea has a small, isolated economy, with a government only propped up because China doesn't want to deal with a refugee crisis on their border. Russia, on the other hand, has a massive economy, with some of the largest reserves of oil and natural gas in the world. It's apples to oranges."

Katja Kipping of Germany's Left Party, for instance, seems to be relatively anti-US and relatively neutral towards Russia, but not pro-Putin from what I've seen. I've heard that Syriza has been developing ties with Russia to a greater extent, but I would guess that might be more due to their difficult situation with the EU than because they really 'want Putin to win'.  Definitely the far left as I know it in Britain is opposed to Putin. I'm not going to definitely shut down the idea of a European left-Putin alliance altogether but I'm not persuaded either.

It's mainly correct in places like southeast Iraq, but then the most highly Shia part of Syria is the coast and it isn't even acknowledged by the line, and the southern part that's under the ""Sunni Shia line"" are places like Daraa that are majority Druze, while places north of the line like Aleppo, Damascus, etc. are vast majority Sunni.   Iran is above the Sunni Shia line, along with all of Sunni Iraq and Kurdistan (almost all Sunni) as well as Syria again being vast-majority Sunni on both sides of the line.  The map itself is fine I imagine, but that damned line is totally off."

geopolitics,3dxlkc,Buddydedum,2,Mon Jul 20 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm less knowledgeable about Palestine than I am about Syria and Iraq, but I think that part of the reason that they are allies is because Iran is quite staunchly against Israel so their interests align on that front."
geopolitics,3dxlkc,Alikese,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure how familiar you are with the region, but it's really, really important not to overestimate the importance of the Sunni-Shi'i divide. That's important, but mostly regarding factional interests, not national interests.   While /u/Alikese has a point in what he said, Iranian support for Palestine isn't recent, like you said. It goes all the way back to the 1979 Revolution. Remember, anti-imperialism was a core part of the Iranian revolution. Supporting Palestine gives two enormous advantages given that is the case:  Domestically, it overturned a relatively unpopular policy of the Shah, lending further popular credence to the revolution's anti-imperialist message.   Internationally, it came immediately following the Egyptian-Israeli peace, and at a time when support for Palestine from the Arab states (maybe  sort of except Syria) was at a low, with inter-Arab political maneuvering at a relatively high point. This gave Iran's new regime a not insignificant amount of ideational capital that it could translate into power projection (see 1982 in Lebanon).  My point being, while religion has its place, it's really not as strong an indicator of mutual interests as its often  made out to be."

That's important, but mostly regarding factional interests, not national interests.   That's not really as true as it would have been maybe 10 years ago. Iran's main allies are Hezbollah, Bashar and Abadi/Maliki all of whom are Shia. His main regional enemies are Syrian rebels, ISIS, and the gulf states, all of whom are Sunni. Turkey, also Sunni, is a regional rival even if they aren't enemies. The conflict in Yemen is along sectarian lines now, the two sides being supported by Iran and Saudi.  Yes, there are instances of sides overcoming their religious differences to partner quite productively as in the case of Iran and the Kurds, but the regional conflicts have really stratified religious differences in the past few decades in places like Iraq and Syria."
geopolitics,3dxlkc,Alikese,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"Right, but I'm not saying that religion doesn't matter, it's just that it's far less relevant in terms of national interests.  If we take Iran, yes, we're absolutely going to see its allies be mostly Shi'i, but that's not just because the Iranian government is Twelver.  If it were, we should see broadstroke Shi'i and Sunni alliances opposing one another - and we don't see Syria with the kind of alliance systems that Iran has developed, do we?  You're kind of taking it out of historical context if you simply say, ""Well right now Iran's allies are mostly Shi'i and their opponents are mostly Sunni.""  That's removing why those alliances developed the way they did, and reducing it to religion.  Now, in Iran's case especially, Shi'ism has been important in developing clients, but that's mostly because Shi'i populations have been historically disenfranchised in a lot of Arab states, and so if you have a revolutionary anti-imperialist regime that is also Shi'i, that's a phenomenal source of soft power.  It allows it to court unhappy populations in, as you say, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and many other countries.  Reducing it to religion ignores how each relationship historically developed.  But look at the Syrian case you point to.  Syria isn't aligned with Iran because they're Shi'i, it's largely because they became aligned during a period when they were both the only major an immediate opposition to Israel, and were both strapped for allies.  It was a pragmatic alliance despite deep ideological divisions.  Reducing it to Shi'a Islam is doing the relationship a disservice.  And if we look at the Sunni side, yes, Turkey has a rivalry with Iran, but the major point of contention is not Islam, it's the Syrian regime.  And you can bet the poor Damascus-Ankara relations are more a consequence of history than of religion.  And then how do explain the poor Qatari-Saudi relations circa 2013-14 with religion as the key?  The key is clearly MB, but even if we take that from a Salafi-MB divide, that makes no sense given Saudi Arabia's other less fundamentalist Sunni clients.  And what about Saudi Arabia's recent indications about changing its MB policy?  That would throw everything out of whack again.   Yes, there are instances of sides overcoming their religious differences to partner quite productively as in the case of Iran and the Kurds, but the regional conflicts have really stratified religious differences in the past few decades in places like Iraq and Syria.   They have, and that's what I meant by factional interests, not national interests.  Militias and smaller organizations don't have the same kinds of imperatives as states, and so they've often more flexibility when it comes to alignment.   Still, that doesn't prevent even them from taking allies when their interests dictate such actions to be valuable to their interests.  Look what happened after the battle of Ramadi, for example.  And that type of cooperation between Shi'i militias, the Iraqi state, and anti-IS Sunni tribes has been fairly constant in Iraq.  Similar things happen in Syria (though with less frequency).  Sorry for typing so much.  Point being that if you reduce it to religion, you're missing so much historical context it gets to the point of absurdity.  You're right, there are trends that support the notion of a geopolitical Sunni-Shi'i divide, but the actual geopolitics of the region make no sense just using that framework."

There is plenty of talk of nations ""slipping"" out of Chinese influence, but I think that's implying something that was never there in the first place.    U.S. foreign policy bigwigs have consistently labelled Myanmar as a Chinese client state in the past...   It's way to simplistic to say Myanmar was ""forced"" to deal with China exclusively, because it could have counter-balanced China with Russian ties."

The answer to both these question is ""not much"".  It was only in the 90's when Burma became a so called client state of China (coincidentally, right after they crushed a few democracy movement and led to international sanctions).  So my counter to you is, it's simplistic to say Burma was a client state of China."

geopolitics,3dvkfg,Risay117,2,Mon Jul 20 07:07:57 2015 UTC,"That discussion is fairly weak. Russia IS a regional power but let's not forget that Russia did help US in Afghanistan, was anti Iraq war with France and Germany, resolved Syrian issue with chemical weapons, helped in Iran (as per Obama). I am sure that Russia can influence other parts of the world. I don't understand instant dismissal. While it is a regional power and way behind on world stage, it has potential and there is no reason to alienate Russia.   I think there is a huge misunderstanding about Russia. First the Soviet Union is gone, so there is no ideological issue anymore, there is no reason not to engage them. The 90's were bad for the Russians, the shock therapy did not work. Not only that, Russo-American relations quickly started to turn sour after Kosovo. I don't believe for a second that Americans didn't know that it would put a strain with a newly formed Russian state, they just didn't care. Which brings me to Putin. This is precisely why he is popular, he put an end to this. But, here is a big point. Putin tried to engage the US in diplomatic relations. There were NATO-Russian cooperation talks, Putin was the first one to call during 9/11, he gave intel for Afghanistan. He wanted to be in the game but he wanted to be on equal terms, which Americans didn't want. I am not saying it to ""blame America"", I am simply outlying the geopolitical climate of that time. Russia was not a major player, that's why nobody asked them to do more, they were still irrelevant in Western eyes. That put off the Russians and mid 00's relations started to drift further apart.   Also, let's recall. Anti-ballistic missiles shields in Europe that US pushed for and support for Georgians in 2008. It's the little things.   If NATO and US has different goals then so be it but what I am saying is that there is a method to the Russian ""madness"". It's not simply Putin came in to power and Russia turned Stalinist, it was a gradual process of geopolitical mistakes and disconnected goals from both sides.   The same goes for Crimean fiasco. Russia gambled on it not because of a land grab but because Ukraine started to play with idea that Russians are going to be out of the Crimea. Pro-Western president could cut them off and eventually give the base to NATO. Again, Putin was assured that Yanukovich would leave peacefully with new constitution for Ukraine and the presidential elections, it didn't happen. The trigger was pulled and Crimean wild card played. The important take away is that we are missing dialogue with Russia again. We had 3 European guarantors sign a deal that Yanukovich would leave and violence would be controlled. Didn't happen. Russians are pragmatic and by this time started to trust the West less and less. I personally think it was to be expected.  So where does the Russia stands today? It's not a simple question. I wouldn't dismiss them just yet. They do exercise power regionally but I think that their realpolitik could have been avoid if we engaged them more and on equal terms. Russians also can have value globally. As we saw in Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and even now ISIL. Russians have a long history with Islamic extremists, if this is a global concern then I think Russia can be of value. We also see Russians turning East. I don't think it's a good idea because our rhetoric in the media is strongly anti-Russian but we lack understanding of the Russians to begin with. It's my opinion but I can't even emphasize how many Russian historians and Eastern European studies experts I've met who have the same view. It's always the topic I throw in to see how do they analyze the situation. Going back to Sino-Russian relations. Again, the thing that worries me is the growing power of China. You see, they are conservative and so are Russians, but they weren't like that (Russians) in the 90's. There was an opportunity to really help and engage Russians, I think we've missed that and now they are reverting to their old system of government, unfortunately autocratic. The West too is guilty of resorting to Cold War reflexes, let's not kid ourselves, we still treat Russia as the Soviet Union but the key point is that they are not socialist anymore.   In short, I think Russia will depend on China if they are going to project their power. They might be going for the Eurasian Union and strengthen ties with China and BRICS in general. That would plug them into ""alternative"" economy but it's not robust as Western. It seems like right now the push is for the multipolar world where countries can project their power regionally without US consent, it is almost anti-neoliberalism that is emerging today. The problem with Putin is that he is fixated on foreign policy, this might be his downfall because domestically he needs to do much better. Their place will depend on how prosperous they can get within their country, if they will focus on advanced research and technology. It would be dangerous to strictly play geopolitical games and neglecting domestic growth, education, research, investments, etc.   A few sources that I'd recommend to read to get a little bit wider perception of my understanding of current Russian politics:  G. Kennan, Buchanan, Mearsheimer, Jeffrey Sachs"

They seem to have pretty good content, though they don't churn out articles willy nilly (probably why the content level is above average)."
geopolitics,3dtfto,i_already_forgot,4,Sun Jul 19 09:31:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty accurate assessment, and I'm glad it didn't do what I expected (and what the title sort of implied) and claim that Russia was some kind of leader beforehand, and has swapped with China. In reality, the SCO only got off the ground because its other members recognised the approximate parity of Russia and China back then, taking into account both military and economic power.   Because of this parity, they could effectively balance themselves, and would not simply be bullied by the largest power (as was the case in Russia's now-defunct CIS, and remains the case in its dysfunctional EEU project—without Ukraine in it, that is). What's happened since is, of course, that China's economic might has sat it in the leadership position while its military might steadily improves. There are no particular 'turning points' to behold, I don't think, but it should be increasingly obvious that China's the real primus inter pares here."
geopolitics,3dtfto,Kameniev,5,Sun Jul 19 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"Some parallels here to France and Germany as leaders in the EU.

But China, like Germany, couldn't help but become the leader anyway, given the size and dynamism of its economy."

The intentional vagueness of the alleged threat abroad requiring Japanese aid and assistance to U.S. allies is open to wide discretion of overt misinterpretation for Japanese self-interest. An easy example would be Taiwan; while Japanese is sympathetic to the common cause of democracy and limiting Chinese influence on a private level, it will be hard pressed to demonstrate this sympathy without economic mutual assured destruction with China by intervening on Taiwan's behalf, even at a logistical level.  If Japanese assistance isn't useful in Taiwan, or even in the Korean peninsula where South Korea is likely going to object any Japanese soldiers aiding/assisting South Korean military on Korean soil, then it is a demonstration of U.S. withdrawal from Asia-Pacific security responsibility, which is the opposite of what Asia Pivot is all about!"

geopolitics,3dlaez,Revsweerev,17,Fri Jul 17 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are people who do, and they're naive. But that wasn't the point. Without the agreement, Iran would've continued on their way, at their leisure, with the international community in the dark. This would've inevitably lead to conflict, as Saudi Arabia or Israel would've continued to instigate and insist on Western action, and Iran would've become more bitter and insular as decades of sanctions weighed down on them. Now, if they want to continue their research into military application for atomic energy, their quest will be much more difficult and complicated. You can't just make a nuke. There's dozens of things that can go wrong, and many places where the international community could discover their deception. There's also a chance here for Iran to rejoin the international community. A state that's heavily integrated with other states, both politically and economically, is a lot less likely to cause problems than a pariah state who feels the world is against them. Is this deal perfect? No. But it is a step in the right direction, and it is much better than the alternative."
geopolitics,3dlaez,jrock954,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"I think this is just kicking the problem down the road. You do bring some interesting points though but it is quiet clear that Iran sees nuclear weapons as vital for its geopolitical ambitions and as a deterrent to outside pressure.   They are just buying time for now. Without the sanctions they have an additional 100+ billions to their GDP which is a lot of money for a 700B economy. They will probably play nice for a while, the more heavily re-start their work. Wait a while and you'll see the US accusing Iran of breaking the agreement, then Iran fires back saying these are lies.   Iran may also purchase some nice defense systems like the S-400 which Russia said it was willing to sell. And as sanctions get lifted Russia can sell it without facing any resistance from Washington.   Anyway, I'm certainly not advocating for war but I don't trust Iran one bit. In my opinion the US should have had the stronger stance here (instead it was France) and should have closed a much tougher deal for Iran."

Every reasonably powerful state since 1945 that's wanted nuclear weapons has gotten them. In this sense, an Iranian nuke is somewhat inevitable, but by the time it's possible, US hegemony will be much reduced, and there's little doubt that some hope the Iranian regime might have changed/been overthrown before then.  Incidentally, the S-400 was more a warning to Israel from Russia when Jerusalem seemed on the brink of interfering in Ukraine (diplomatically etc.)."

At the same time though, I don't see it as a problem. Iran is in a very bad position geographically speaking, and geopolitically speaking they're even worse. If they do try to get a bomb, (which, it could be argued, is within their right as a sovereign nation, given our own inability to work within the framework of our own non-proliferation ideals) the Saudis, Turks, and Israelis won't wait for us to get our shit together and fix the issue. I'm hoping that if an office chair analyst with no formal training or experience knows this, the Iranians do as well, and that will make them think a little harder about kicking the regional hornet nest.      I'll agree that the US could've taken a harder line, especially since the deal bars American inspectors from the sites, but what can you do. With Russia and China active in the negotiations, there was no way we'd get everything we want. The fact that the arms embargoes were added into the deal, but not Iran's support of Shia proxies, shows me that there was more give-and-take than a pure bilateral negotiation would've produced. I'm just praying that this doesn't turn into a rehash of 90s Iraq. I don't know how well I'll handle our incredibly unbiased 24-hour news networks covering that."

Your intuition is probably correct though that they are primarily interested in SCS oil, trade lanes, and other economic interests.  Japan accedes to the One China policy, but in terms of Realpolitik, it would be in their best interests to keep a buffer zone between a regional (and perhaps global) superpower and themselves, if possible."
geopolitics,3djew7,smayonak,3,Fri Jul 17 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's to deter China from attacking Taiwan.   Pffff. The Japanese public is very sympathetic to Taiwan but if ever turns into a shooting war, they will run far in the opposite direction. You'll note that despite recent Japanese overtures to Vietnam, the Philippines, and India, there are none towards Taiwan. Taiwan is a core interest of China and if the legal fiction that it's a part of China comes under attack, things will get really tense (Something like 90% of the Chinese population considers Taiwan a very important issue - that's enough for the CCP to consider going to war over it, despite the risks involved).  IMO, several factors for what's happening. The old arrangement was accepted by Japan because its defense was assured by the US and it accepted by everybody else because as long as this was true, Japan wouldn't need to repeal the constraints in its constitution.  The US's traditional role as an honest broker in the region is now kaput. From a purely pragmatic perspective, even if you're not a hawk, Japan could get dragged into whatever the US cooks up, so that's a good reason to decouple yourself. And if you're nervous about US commitment, pursuing your own security policy is an necessary hedge.  Washington has begun to see Japan as a potential asset against China. But as long as Japan is restrained by its constitution, it can't really do anything other than defend itself, so that has to go. A Right-wing Nationalist like Abe is only too happy to oblige."

geopolitics,3djew7,The_Automator22,2,Fri Jul 17 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, but China isn't Vietnam or Korea during the 50s. Japanese bases are staging grounds for the US military and if the shooting starts, China isn't going to quibble over the fact the bases are on Japanese territory when going after them. That's how Japan could get dragged in militarily. As Japan's sole security guarantor, the US has a lot of leverage (I suspect this is part of the reason they didn't join the AIIB).   With this change, Japan is now free to act with the US to do more than just defend their own territory, but at the same time, it gives it more diplomatic freedom as well. In the past, if Japan tried to pursue a mutual defense pact with, say, Vietnam, they'd get instantly rebuffed because they can't possibly hold up their end of the bargain. Now that they've slipped the leash, they can pursue these alliances. And if the US ever gets into a war and goes ""Hey, Japan, bro, you gotta help me out here."", Japan can decline to get involved and still have other allies to fall back on, instead of being forced to choose between fighting a war or essentially dissolving their own alliance."

If anything cooperating is getting closer. Until 2005 US nuclear carriers were not allowed to dock in Yokosuka and Japan actively . If you wanted to decouple and distance yourself opening up one of your most important ports as the base for a US nuclear flagship as something you would want to do.  https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/chronology-japans-remilitarization  Given Japan's lack of natural materials and need for export markets. I think your going to see a strengthening of the US Japanese military cooperation and integration rather than decoupling. To not do so means conceding the sea lands to Chinese influence and control, which would be intolerable for Japan considering their dependence on those very same sea lands for both raw materials and export markets."

geopolitics,3dlcsr,iamthegodemperor,4,Fri Jul 17 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"I wish I had found a better article, but Stephen Walt is often worth reading----if sometimes incorrect.   There is often an observation & related prediction that Europe (actually the EU) is not functioning well. Walt notes problems the EU has (Overexpansion, lack of motivation to deal with security threats, the Eurocrisis & nationalism)  He argues that simply muddling through will weaken resolve/morale to strengthen the EU and will not cause its economy to grow faster.   While, I think his assessment of the disconnects between EU/national & EU/citizens are true, I'm cautiously confident that EU crises force unelegant but necessary fixes, that over the long term will create a stronger Union. It seems to me very unlikely that the EU ever unravel. But I doubt even as a strong unit, that it will ever maintain large amounts of GDP growth. This seems to be a fact for all the advanced countries, the US included. So it's possible to hold the EU has a future, but that Europe as a region will decline, at least relatively.   I don't believe it is really possible to ""solve"" the problems Walt outlines. Nationalism is not going to just go away. Naturally this creates disconnects between EU citizens and their sense of representation supranationally. Likewise, the issue of nationalism makes it difficult to do things like force the Greeks to turn their finances etc to the EU or to do common sense things like place an IMF recommended haircut on Greek debt or transfer money from Berlin to Athens (like NY to Arkansas etc.)  The solutions usually involve engaging the public to make them realize no choices really are available and forcing countries to accept impolitic roles in the Union. This creates alienation. But the flip side is that slowly the project moves away some of its contradictions. Because no satisfactory framework was found, Germany is now accepted as the defacto head of Europe. The only way for the Greek/EU eurocrisis to be resolved was for the nationalist logics to be played out to where they couldn't be implemented. Greece held a protest plebiscite, then acceeded to unprecedentedly harsh German demands, which in turn will quietly be eased through various technocratic measures ( ex. extensions on loan payments with little or no interest instead of a straightforward haircut on debt)."

Britain, unlike most European countries, has other things it can rely upon to ensure its voice is heard in a world where European powers of old are increasingly marginalized (see: Special Relationship, re-invigoration of the Commonwealth as a FTA).

A quick search shows that the UK got around 65 million people and Germany got around 81 million. Comparing size of Economy the UK got a GDP (PPP) of $2.5 Trillion while Germany got one of $ 3.8 Trillion. While the UK's economy is growing at a rate of around 3.2% compared to Germany's 1.4% ( in 2014 according to Wikipedia which sourced the CIA Factbook )it wil still not surpass Germany's GDP.    Let's use these numbers for our future estimates.The UK manages to keep up it's 3.2% growth and Germany it's 1.4% growth from 2014. 2500 * 1.03220 = 4693.9 3800 * 1.01420 = 5018.1 Now even with this much difference in yearly growth Germany, the largest economy in the EU, still manages to stay ahead of the UK in this hypothetical situation."
geopolitics,3dlcsr,EarlReginald,4,Fri Jul 17 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"True, looking at current metrics this may not be immediately obvious. The biggest factor in this is that Germany's population is rapidly declining while Britain's is steadily rising. This is coupled with other factors such as; Germany continuing to bailout stagnant Southern European economies and weak growth could lead to Britain overtaking it.    Sources: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10537773/Britain-will-become-biggest-economy-in-Europe.html http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25519110 http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/24/business/is-uk-set-to-claim-europes-economic-powerhouse-title/    Granted, a few things would have to realign but short of Germany incentivizing having children, Britain getting a bigger population is inevitable based on current growth/decline rates respectively."
geopolitics,3dlcsr,TehV15,3,Fri Jul 17 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting, if things continue the way they are going now I'll have to agree that the UK has a very good chance of overtaking the Germany and France. Have you considered immigration as a factor? If growth slows down because of an ageing population countries may consider to change their immigration policy. Although Britain most likely has the advantage of having many former colonies where it can attract more immigrants."
geopolitics,3dlcsr,EarlReginald,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, the article points out that Britain would overtake France economically in 2018 but this happened a few months back.    I think immigration plays a huge part in this realignment tbh. Germany is currently reassessing whether it wants to continue letting in all the political/economic migrants flooding them from Africa and the ME. Will they really want to let in more for economic or demographic reasons? Increasingly, Germany is looking like it doesn't want any immigration to it outside of the EU, which could potentially offset this demographic timebomb they're expecting.  I think if the UK leaves the EU it'll be forced out of necessity to revive the Commonwealth FTA and Free Movement of People to maintain relevancy in the 21st century. Biggest economy of Europe or not, it'll be a meaningless island in a world dominated by continental superpowers. That being said, I still think the UK even with Germany relying on non-EU immigrants to swell its population, will still be surpassed."

geopolitics,3divlw,manualLurking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but that is not something that happens immediately. First Spain either recognizes or does not recognize the independence. And then assuming Spain refuses to recognize it, they choose to either:    A: Throw out all Spanish officials and make it clear they are willing to fight  B : Refuse to acknowledge orders from the Spanish government and peacefully ignore Spain's non-acknowledgement while performing as if they were an independent country C : Surrender to Spain's will and try to convince Spain to recognize their independence through some other method.   Assuming A or B they will still be a long way from UN recognition and would be more interested in other states recognizing them and will likely be recognized by some and not others for a while before it even becomes an issue that the UN discusses.  And if Spain does choose to recognize their independence it is a non-issue.  Either way you are trying to skip too many steps and simplify a very complicated matter."

geopolitics,3di4lx,JesusIsAVelociraptor,4,Fri Jul 17 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"A lot has changed actually. That video was posted in the summer of 2014. Several months ago (from that date) Crimea got annexed, Yanukovich overthrown, UA national guard entered Donbass fairly recently. It's been a year and situation has ""normalized"" more or less. Back then there were speculations of annexation of Donbass. Nobody understood implications of Ukrainian army shelling Donbass. Nobody took seriously battalions like Azov, Right Sector, Aidar, Tornado, etc. There was speculation of massive Russian troops gathering. International community didn't really understand what was going on, events were unfolding fast. There was a lot of speculation, promises, and tension in the world. I am not saying it doesn't exist now but it is much more mild now, we've had dialogue for over a year now, we've seen demands from all sides, we've seen agreements and why they don't hold, we've seen hysteria to die down a bit, etc. I haven't seen the talk yet, I admit that, but since situation in Ukraine was still hot and evolving fast, I think that analysis of the geopolitical situation got ""compromised"" because nobody had a clear and sobering picture. I've seen some wild speculations popping up a year ago. I think that things have settled down a little and we have a bit more sobering picture of the conflict. I'll check out the video in a bit but something tells me it's going to miss some critical things here and there."

Some really great points made by both sides."

geopolitics,3dgf4b,utnahpishtim,2,Thu Jul 16 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with Dan when he says Sam's position is flawed in the sense that previous interventions have gone horribly and that we cherry pick who to help based on interests. Sam's position here is just pure naivete.  Sam has a better point about Islam, though Dan is right when he says a religious love of death is not unique to Islam. Sam is correct that it's unique to Islam in this day and age and something that needs to be addressed as it's a logical extension of the core doctrine, and very popular. His point on helping to bring about change by empowering reformers is good as well, there's a lot of them in the Muslim world that need support.  Overall I agree with Dan, especially on intervention. Sam makes better points on Islam and understands what makes it different from Judaism or Christianity, most people just talk about all three as if they're the same and unchanging since their inception."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,heisgone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with that to but I don't agree  with Dan's conclusions, just because they are motivated by self interest doesn't have to mean it's a bad thing, except of course i n the cases where that intervention goes horribly wrong and leaves a less secure world than the one that existed before. Take for instance their discussion on Syria, where Sam was arguing that the US involvement isn't in really in US interest that they are involved based on ideological reasons, while Dan rebuffs him and argues against intervening based, saying that it's not ideological but the politicians are getting involved because of how bad it would look to the public if the US sat on it's hands while a humanitarian disaster took place. Isn't that a good thing though? To live in a world where politicians are forced to intervene for humanitarian reasons when it doesn't suit their interest."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,utnahpishtim,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:39:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have been more specific, because I agree with you. I think the level of intervention in Syria that we have now is the way to go. We give the air power while the locals are the boots on the ground. I don't agree with total isolationism.  But I agree with Dan when he says that Syria isn't motivated by solely by humanitarian concerns and the problem of cherry picking he raises puts a thorn in Sams argument a little, I can't agree that this status quo is something that should continue - I'd like to see more consistency. His view of politicians is mostly on point imo though I think the reality lies somewhere in between Dan's cynicism and Sams idealism. They both argue their positions well."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,heisgone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"He point could be made (not that it is my opinon nor Sam's opinion, just a bringing a different point of view) that things are more simple when people are acting for their own self-interest, as they are rational agent. That's why we had the cold war. With Islam, this is something that shouldn't be labeled as self-interest, as while someone might hope for paradise in in own self-interest, it is such a delusional belief and so remove from reality that the actor are no longer acting rationnally."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,utnahpishtim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Sam's point works there. But he doesn't really need comparisons because Islam is unique in that position today so i don't think there's anything to justify - the problem is here and we should look to see how we solve it (as Sam says). However if you go back before the Cold War, as Dan said, you could see the Japanese fighting with the same kind of fanaticism.   So throughout history especially going far back enough, you can easily find the same kind of fanaticism and willingness to die and honor around a warrior culture. What Dan didn't get was Sam's approach to winning the ""hearts and minds"", I think he views it in the same lens as Sam's opinion's on intervention's but I think Sam's approach to helping reform in the Muslim world is a bit different. He wants to empower locals - militarily the comparison could be made to Syria right now. We give the air power and the locals do the heavy lifting."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,heisgone,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"The upcoming book by Harris and Nawaz will tell us more on his position in term of action. Harris said Nawaz convinced him about a few things (it had never been clear what Harris believed in term of action, he was more focused on waking up people to the problem). There is one thing that make the Japanese comparison inadequate. The soldiers took the emperor as their absolute leader. Even the soldier who refused to surrender for years did it because he didn't believe they lost the war. Once the war was lost, there was no splinter groups keeping the fighting. This might be the reason why Carlin think a Pope of Islam would be a good thing. The think he is missing is that Sunni Islam is a grassroot movement. They reject the authority found in Shia Islam. ISIS has some momentum in being recognized as an authority but they are also rejected has one by countless of group like Al Quaeda. Ultimately, there is always some guys that deny the authority, and that's what make Islam so powerful and challenging."

This might be the reason why Carlin think a Pope of Islam would be a good thing.   That's a good point. Islam lacks the central authority, anyone can point to a famous scholar they like and that's it - that's Islam to them. No one has a final say except this vague, huge body of scholars.   The idea of a central authority in Islam seems crazy but it could still happen. We're living in a time where having no Caliphate is the weird exception to the rule.   Thanks to IS though, the ascension of this kind of authority (especially if it calls itself a Caliphate) is going to be hard to swallow for a lot of people."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,Llaine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"There is still a reason to not want a Caliph: Islam isn't like Judaism which has this piece of land defined in an old book. Islam is meant to rule all over the world. Iran see itself as a kind of Caliph (not sure they use this word, but they believe the be the Islamic authority). That's why they support rebels and want to conquer Mecca. A powerful Caliph in the Middle East would be a scary thing for the west. It could be mean constant war at their borders but with no end game. A Caliph pain threshold could be much higher than Russia or China. With nuclear weapons, it would be nighmarish. I can understand why the West might prefer to maintain a divide and conquer policy. As long as Islamists are still fighting for local power in the ME, they don't have the mean to fight for global power."

geopolitics,3dgf4b,Revsweerev,-2,Thu Jul 16 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"I've listened to a few of Dan Carlin's podcasts from the Common Sense show and with many facts he's just plain wrong, as if he doesn't understand geopolitics at all. But then you think about it a little more and find out that he's an isolationist so it kinda comes together.    There are two more recent podcasts about Ukraine and at one point he talks about NATO's article 5 and says ""if Russia attacks the Baltics NATO must go to war, because you have this article 5 etc. etc."". ""Now think about that folks, if Russia attacks the Baltics NATO starts WWIII"". And I'm sitting there thinking how the fuck does this even make sense? Russia attacks a NATO member, NATO intervenes to defend it and but it's NATO who starts the war?   In this particular instance he's talking about US intervention in conflicts and he's basically arguing about the fact that US intervenes to stop the bloodshed but in many cases it just waits too long. And if the US didn't intervene maybe the conflict would stop sooner. He's basically saying that if the US wanted to intervene it should have done it immediately, not after hundreds of thousands have died. Sam didn't brought it up but he should have said that if the US intervened quickly like Dan said, then people like him would say that the US is trigger happy. It's like there is no win with these people.   They also talk about Islam and again Dan is being pro-Islam and tries to defend the fact that Muslims can be offended and somehow don't we understand that if we write and draw something negative about them they're going to be upset. He doesn't try to justify the bombings and killings but somehow tries to make us believe what we're doing is wrong. On multiple occasions (I don't remember if it's in this episode or others) he talks about how cultures vary (again in the context of Islam) and what we find abnormal is perfectly OK in other cultures. Like it's all relative and nothing is wrong with many of Islam's ideas."
geopolitics,3dgf4b,Revsweerev,7,Thu Jul 16 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think your criticism's are entirely on point there. In the case of US not intervening quick enough I felt he was pointing that out to show that when the US intervenes it's not for ideological reasons, that if they want to portray themselves as the enforcer of ideological ideas then they should react then they should intervene immediately. Of course the US doesn't actually intervene for ideological reasons I just think Dan was trying to illustrate that, his position is that they shouldn't intervene at all, at least not outside their own continent.   I don't think Dan doesn't have his problems with other cultures rather he is of the opinion one culture shouldn't be able enforce their cultural ideas on another culture across the globe, he actually seems to believe that if the majority of the ME want to live with oppressive rules the West has no right to intervene.    ""Now think about that folks, if Russia attacks the Baltics NATO starts WWIII""   He was merely illustrating what a red line taking military action against a NATO member if for the US, that even the slightest intrusion into NATO territory results in full blown war with the US, he wasn't trying to blame NATO for WWIII in this hypothetical situation."

I'm not saying China won't become the world's largest economy. I'm say it won't have a hegemony. China also so far lacks soft power and allies.   The US doesn't become a super power through economics alone but also by setting up the world's largest net work of alliances. China had no hope of doing this. The US also has Hollywood. China keeps trying to imitate Hollywood but,  they haven't produced to many movies that have captured the worlds imagination yet. In fact I would say Bollywood had actually done a better job than China has. How often do westerners read Chinese literature? Not often, but a lot of them read manga.   China has done a great job of bringing masses of people out of poverty and creating a middle class. But China has done a poor job of becoming a hegemon.   Also the countries around China don't see them in the best light. The Vietnamese hate the Chinese and so does nearly every other country in the region. The US was blessed by only bordering Canada and Mexico. It's easy to form a hegemony when there is no competition. China doesn't have that luxury."

Everybody wants immigration fixed for instance, but the issue is how to fix it. There are dozens of plans and nobody can decide which to actually follow through on. Mostly because that would require democrats and republicans agreeing.  Then there is infrastructure, but we can't let that affect the debt! Oh and we need to fund the military, and welfare and social security and free education and subsidized businesses which are essential to keeping our economy running.  Gridlock is the result of a system that was designed to prevent any one part of government from being able to have too much power attempting to deal with issues it was never intended to deal with.  A republic is not an empire. Although it does seem that it tends to progress in that direction...."
geopolitics,3dfgz5,JesusIsAVelociraptor,2,Thu Jul 16 08:57:41 2015 UTC,"Do you have an example of different lobbying groups vying for different immigration or infrastructure plans, and therefore causing gridlock?  My understanding of the winter that's come over Congress in the last eight years or so is that there's become less of an institutional incentive for politicians to compromise with one another.  Because districts are gerrymandered such that almost all of them are guaranteed to consistently vote left or right, politicians generally only face threats in primary elections -- which usually comes in the form of more radical politicians challenging the incumbent. This, in turn, tends to usher both the GOP and the Dems further right and left, respectively. A prime example of this is the wave of Tea Party freshman congresspeople, who came into office after taking more extreme stances than their incumbent opponents.  What this results in is, as I said before, a partisan system, with little incentive to compromise."
geopolitics,3dfgz5,krosork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"I am not saying partisanship is not a relevant factor, but it is not the only factor and it is not a new one or an unexpected one.  Gridlock is more complicated than just one issue or just gerrymandering allowing the most extreme to get into office. Its the combination of all these factors, and the cultural divide, and the groupthink herd mentality that comes naturally to humans."
geopolitics,3dfgz5,JesusIsAVelociraptor,3,Thu Jul 16 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"I think the real reason here is a matter of political indifference or outright vilification of politics by the average American. Used to be, back when my grandfather was around, being a congressman or state senator was something to aspire to.   Government was something to aspire to. People wanted to be Mayor or a member of the town board - they wanted their voices to be heard. They wanted to change things - and change them the way they've always been changed.  That doesn't happen anymore. My grandfather told my father he shouldn't be a politician. It's dirty. It's corrupt, it's whatever you want to call it.  Why?  Vietnam. Vietnam was the turning point in American politics, and the Iraq War is turning into another destruction of political efficacy among Americans. Our government stopped working for us - drafted us, sent us to some shitty war nobody wanted to fight. Old men playing god with kids' lives.  And suddenly your congressman wasn't there to help you.

I also found the inability to respond to arguments about the federal debt by the for side a bit disappointing. The U.S. borrows at negative interest rates, and I don't see how bankruptcy is possible when that is the case.   I also don't see the great divide on immigration, or really why it's a huge deal. When immigrants have reached a certain point, the U.S. has consistently simply amnestied them. This is kicking the can down the road, but it is also probably the best policy for making effective use of the advantages immigration gives the United States."
geopolitics,3dfgz5,darthpizza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:20 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say the US borrows at negative interest rates? Do you mean that the debt issued by the federal reserve to the federal gov't is actually owned by the federal government and therefore negligible?
geopolitics,3dfgz5,Jonnheh,9,Wed Jul 15 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"I mean that inflation of USD has traditionally outpaced the interest rate of federal bonds. If you buy US government bonds at say, 1.5% interest, and inflation is at 2%, the real interest rate is -.5%. So you're essentially paying to hold US government debt, because while it doesn't outpace inflation like other investments (such as the stock market) it depreciates slower than cash and is in some ways more secure."

It's better than stuffing your cash under a mattress because it can't be stolen, and because cash under a mattress depreciates faster due to inflation.   While bonds don't beat the stock market, they do beat inflation, and they are much more secure than just about any other investment you could make. If bonds become useless, just about every other store of value has also probably collapsed, except for necessities like bullets and pharmacueticals.   So it's essentially safer than the stock market and offers better yields than cash."

I was thinking that for example if you were to hold a $10,000 bond that pays out in a year vs. holding $10,000 worth of cash for a year that you would be better off by $50 dollars if you held the cash. I see now you would actually be $200 better off with the bonds, however the relative value to the money you held a year ago is $50 less.

US default is not possible, because US debt is in USD denominated.   Only sovereign debt (bonds issued by a national government in a foreign currency) can  result default. For example Argentine, Russia briefly, Greece (Euro is essentially foreign currency for Greece) can be in trouble when their  sovereign debt increases too much."

You have already probably witnessed a recent example where the GOP threatened to default on debt payments and US federal worker salaries/pensions/benefits/etc due to political gridlock. Just because the the debt can be paid in US dollars does not mean that the US cannot default.   The US shouldn't default, and there is no good reason I can think of short of entire economic collapse.

And how much wealth would be lost by those who didn't stick it out?   In my complete layman's estimate? Roughly hundreds of billions at the most conservative estimate. More than likely it would be in the trillions. This would effect people from your normal urban slum to people owning that deli down the street, to people who run your local and national banks.    Relative to the rest of the world it's hard to imagine a scenario where US bond markets collapse. Even if we defaulted, relative to the rest of the world we are just too strong economically.    You are mistaking the reasons as to why the US is so strong economically. One of those main reasons is that the US dollar is the lynchpin behind the current global system, and people trust that US dollar will remain unquestionably valuable. Now, there are multiple reasons for this. The US dollar is already so ingrained in the global system, partially/mostly due to it's petrodollar status.   Second, the US has never defaulted on a debt payment. That's what makes the US dollar so reliable. You can invest in the British pound and be safe, even though the UK economy isn't close to the US economy.

I need to disagree with you on that bright future. India and China, specifically, have counter goals. Both want increasing dominance in central Asia, and India will not want SE Asia to fall entirely into China's dominion. Russia has similar problems. It doesn't want central Asia to fall into India's or Russia's sphere, so it will exert influence there as well, creating tensions between the countries. These will be only exacerbated because these countries are all so close together, and vying for dominance in the same areas along their borders.   Add with that the powder keg that is the Middle East, and the future is ripe with potential conflict.   Not to mention there is no real tying cultural or political aspect between the countries.

Also I'm pretty sure the Iraqis would respond violently to a declaration of independence.  An independent Kurdistan would mean conflict with Turkey and Iraq, which no one wants.   I see them continuing to stay the course as almost de facto independent, which in itself may lead to conflict if Iraq tries to reassert great rule in the north after ISIS is dealt with.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Kurds, who are clearly doing a good job of filling the power-vacuum in places ISIS retreats from, get into conflicts with their neighbors who don't like seeing a more powerful Kurdistan."

Regarding Iraq's opposition to Kurdish independence, at what point would a state constituting former Iraqi and Syrian territory be in a position to assert it's independence unilaterally even in the face of Iraqi opposition? It seems that the Kurds are more capable of fighting ISIS than Iraq (as it's currently constituted and governed) is. Is there any chance this would happen (a la Israel in 1949)? And if so, what would the US do? I couldn't see the US continuing to aid Iraq if Iraq was fighting the Kurds, and if Turkey made any moves against an independent Kurdistan that didn't contain any Turkish territory then they would immediately (I hope) be widely condemned and restrained by the international community."
geopolitics,3dbkil,lordderplythethird,7,Wed Jul 15 05:21:52 2015 UTC,"I'm less familiar with Iran's stance on the issue, but would imagine that their opposition to a Kurdish state would be moot if the state had US support.   It's not so much that Iran is opposed to a Kurdish state, it's that they're afraid the Kurds would try and take Kurdish parts of Iran with them. Also that, by splitting Iraq into Iraq and Kurdistan, we'd be driving Iraq straight into the arms of Iran, which, nuclear deal aside, is not something US/western foreign policy wants.   Is there any chance this would happen (a la Israel in 1949)? And if so, what would the US do?   that's a hard call. Honestly, since Turkey's supported the KRG (Iraqi Kurdistan's government) in the past, I feel they wouldn't be opposed to a Kurdish state made 100% out of former Iraqi territory. Reason being is, it would obviously weaken Iraq, and Turkey wants to become a regional shot caller. Splitting Iraq into 2 countries would be a dream for them. Also, it could cause a large number of Kurdish PKK members in Turkey to abandon their guerilla war against Turkey.  Iraq would be 100% against a fully independent Kurdistan though. Iraqi Kurdistan accounts for roughly 50% of Iraq's population, but accounts for over 77% of its GDP. An independent Kurdistan would be free to build its own oil pipelines instead of using the heavily taxed ones in Iraq. The Iraqi economy would be crippled almost overnight by an independent Kurdistan.  It's hard to say where the US would stand on the issue honestly. An economically crippled Iraq would be a haven in the eyes of the next Al Qaeda/Taliban group, and it would viewed as a failure of US foreign policy to let a nation it invaded and rebuilt fall into worse hands than it was before the invasion not even a decade later."
geopolitics,3dbkil,Buddydedum,6,Wed Jul 15 06:51:23 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with your point regarding Iraqi-Iranian relations should a Kurdish state exist, but I think you might be underestimating Turkish and Iranian opposition.    Iran and Turkey aren't just worried that an independent Kurdistan would take chunks of their territory.  They're both essentially large multiethnic empires, and the emergence of a Kurdish state that is not a puppet government would likely lead to expanded calls for autonomy or even annexation by their own Kurdish populations.  That's a serious problem especially since it could lead to increased civil violence, or in a worst case scenario, promote similar ethnic nationalist sentiment across both countries in other groups.  Even if Kurdistan remained neutral, it could potentially serve as a base for any independence movements in either country.  I also don't know that splitting Iraq would give Turkey the power you think it would, unless Iraqi Kurdistan was a Turkish puppet.  It would radically expand Iranian influence in Iraq, but Turkey doesn't have the kinds of soft power resources to capitalize on an Iraqi collapse that Iran does, which, if anything would put Turkey behind as a ""shot caller.""  You're right though, Iraq would react poorly, as would Syria, but I think Iran and Turkey would too (again, excluding a potential puppet).  And where does that leave us?  An independent Kurdistan, landlocked and surrounded by hostile governments?  Seems problematic.  And as /u/Meatsim1 said, US support would come at the cost of positive Iranian and Turkish relations for a markedly less powerful ally.  I'm not not sure that's all that likely."
geopolitics,3dbkil,lordderplythethird,4,Wed Jul 15 07:46:05 2015 UTC,"I also don't know that splitting Iraq would give Turkey the power you think it would, unless Iraqi Kurdistan was a Turkish puppet   Iraqi Kurdistan has repeatedly tried to authorize an oil pipeline via Turkey to the Med, but Iraq routinely shuts it down, because they want it to flow through Iraq to the Persan Gulf. Although 1 was built in 2009 without Baghdad's approval, building more and allowing all of that oil to flow through their country, could effectively give Turkey a bigger chip to deal regarding regional politics.  Turkey's historical quarrels with Iraqi Kurdistan have mostly all but disappeared, thanks to the trade and oil pipelines. For all his faults, Erdogan was the first Turkish leader to visit Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey even opened up a Consulate General in Erbil. Turkey currently has displayed little to no quarrels with an independent Kurdistan, as long as it's only made up of territory only in current Iraq, not territory in Syria/Iran/Turkey. It's amazing what $$ and 150,000+ barrels of oil a day can do to relations."
geopolitics,3dbkil,Buddydedum,3,Wed Jul 15 07:57:38 2015 UTC,"Right, but an enormous part of those improved relations has been the current government's dedication to peaceful resolution of both the Kurdish question in Iraq and Turkey.  That's not a small issue.  I'm fully aware of Turkey's rapprochement with Kurdistan, but that doesn't by a long shot alleviate the other problems associated with independence.    I agree, a pipeline from KRG would increase Turkish power, but that chip would only allow for serious pressure on the KRG.  If Turkey used that to pull KRG into its sphere, then you're right, like I already mentioned, that would increase Turkish power.  But it can achieve that through an autonomous region as well, and acting as such a mediator would simultaneously improve its clout in Iraq.  My point is that is not such an easy line to draw from a broken Iraq to Turkish power, and it would only work if KRG looked to Turkey as a patron (which, admittedly, Barzani looks like he's doing - my comment about a puppet).  But again, a significant part of improved relations have been the consequence of KRG hesitance to be assertive about independence.  Turkey will face problems if the talks with the PKK break down and there's a readily available Kurdish state not securely under Turkish influence.  All in all, you're right, this is the best moment for Kurdish independence, but you're dismissing Turkish-Kurdish enmity as ""historical"" when it's still very much a geopolitical factor just because relations are at a high-point.  That doesn't preclude future declining relations, and both Ankara and Erbil know that.  Independence would need to come on Turkish terms, and doing so would shatter Turkish soft power in Iraq and likely Syria, and make any future cooperation with Iran more difficult.  Placing so many eggs in one basket isn't necessarily the best way to power acquisition."

I'm not suggesting Wikipedia is an authoritative source, but it appears from their figures that the population is less than 25% of Iraq's total, and that those people are poorer than the rest of Iraq on a per capita basis. Even without its Kurdish regions Iraq would still have a whole lot of oil, it just needs some peace and stability in order to take advantage of it.  I think the issue of success or failure of US foreign policy could be a really interesting one (assuming a Kurdish state does emerge). At this point it's pretty clear that the attempt to overthrow Saddam's regime and replace it with something more palatable to the West has been a failure. But if a stable, democratic ally is to emerge from this quagmire, then history might look more favourably on the whole affair. Sure, a weakened divided Iraq will strengthen Iran and Turkey's positions in the region (though at this stage it looks like that horse has already bolted), but at the same time the presence of a Kurdish state could create internal pressures for both countries that would serve to undermine their regional hegemony.

I think the lesson that should have been learned about the Kurds and the Middle East in general is that nation states are not automatically a thing that everyone aspires to. It is a western sentiment I think from post-colonial times that a nation state is about the only thing that can sustain political power. I think people tend to make the mistake of assuming then that no matter what one is fighting for, it is in the context of the nation state. Do they have control of it? Has their political power expanded to the borders and become something legible to us? But this is not really how everything works, only the kind of model we have projected onto these places from a western perspective.   We see this kind of tension with regard to issues of indigenous sovereignty, we see it in the Middle East and North Africa in general as most plans revolving around the idea of securing and stabilizing a nation state clashes with the local perception of land ownership. If we look at Nepal, the government that is recognized by the international community(more so than local especially rural people) as the authority stretching to its borders, however the government really only has a consistently active presence in Kathmandu and Baktapur.  Not to mention if we look at the history of Turkey it is clear the the Kurds have not been treated kindly by the nation state ever since Turkey was homogenized. There is also the PKK's ideology to consider, inspired by the Anarchist Murry Bookchin. There is a reason this has resonated with the Kurds beyond the liberatory nature of its rhetoric and that is the essential antithesis of the nation state. I'm not altogether sure the Kurds aspire to the nation state and look for a more fluid autonomous solution. They may not have the power to establish one even if they wanted."

geopolitics,3dbkil,mycatplaysvideogames,7,Wed Jul 15 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"The Kurds would be pro-West, since it would be through the West that they'd be allowed to emerge.  As they've been since the 1990s, they'd be a useful client for the United States, quietly pro-Israel, and would have had to come to some sort of accommodation with Turkey.  Turkey couldn't be ignored in the process; they've bombed Iraqi Kurdistan enough in recent years to prove how good a spoiler they could be.  I think the shreds of Iraq will end up with a Kurdistan; it's already de facto happened.  But as for Syria, Turkey, and Iran?  Well, perhaps Syria, but Turkey doesn't like that idea.  Iran and Turkey both still have the power to hold onto those territories.  They'd only give them up if the international community forced them to, which I don't think would be useful for anyone in the foreseeable future."

Assuming that they can get along and form some sort of government(Which is not a sure thing as the factions in charge don't like each other). They are not going to get the territory in Turkey or Iran. In fact in order to assure western support the would probably have renounce as claim to it, as turkey is allied with west. With out western support Kurdistan would probably crash and burn."
geopolitics,3dbkil,DesertGorilla,2,Wed Jul 15 06:33:30 2015 UTC,"I'm no geopolitical expert by any means but I  don't  think we see a Kurdish state in the next 10 years. I'm going to try and breakout down regionally   Syria The largest Kurdish faction the YPG in Syria has stated that they want autonomy within Syria not indepence. Rojava(Western Kurdistan) is too small and landlocked to function as independent on its own and I doubt the YPG would join a break away Iraqi Kurdistan for political reasons.  Iran Home of the short lived Republic of Mahabad(a failed attempt at a Kurdish state in the mid 1940s and Birth place of current Iraqi Kurdish president Masoud Barzani, Iranian Kurdistan is still very unlikely to become independent on its own right or join a breakaway state. Currently a Kurdish group named the PJAK is fighting Iran in a low level insurgency but the PJAK  only calls for autonomy within Iran not independence. Either way  PJAK isn't strong enough to fight Iran  Turkey   After years of the PKK Turkish conflict I just don't think the Kurds in Turkey can actually force the Turkish government to declare its Kurdish areas independent. The PKK puts human rights of Kurds in Turkey above nationalism.  Iraq If any Kurdish region becomes independent it will be the already autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan however this is why I don't see Iraqi Kurdistan becoming independent. Masoud Barzani president of Iraqi Kurdistan member of the KDP did promise a referendum of for Independence in 2014(but has postponed it ever since Nouri al Malaki left office). I think the biggest reason why Iraqi Kurdistan won't become independent is its economic ties to Turkey who is both Iraqi Kurdistan's largest exporter and importer partner. Turkey would fear that an independent Iraqi Kurdistan would cause a wave of nationalism throughout its Kurdish regions,other nations such as Iran would fear the same as well. Also the PUK(rival of the KDP who fought a civil war in the 1990s) has ties with both Iran and the Iraqi central government(Jalal Talabani is the president of Iraq) independence could potentially spark another war between the two."
geopolitics,3dbkil,bushwakko,2,Thu Jul 16 08:29:59 2015 UTC,Well I would say there may or may not be an independent Kurdish state depending on how history runs in the conflict infested geographical area of the Near East.

geopolitics,3dbkil,Testiclese,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"I personally think that the Kurds just want representation and more self-determination, and that there has been success of a federalised Kurdish Free State within Iraq for allowing these goals. So I think that Turkey needs to lessen its monolithic Turkish identity to allow space for the Kurdish people so that the biggest necessary concession would be a federalisation rather than granting a full autonomous region.   But if a Kurdish autonomous state was to emerge then it would be reliant on the west and in particular Turkey as its access point out of the region for trade. This has already been seen with the Kurdish Free State within Iraq, that they have been focusing on Turkey as their channel to export and import."

geopolitics,3d8820,doorz1,10,Tue Jul 14 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"Price manipulation is certainly a possibility to be considered, but the issue I have with that theory is that prices have seen no stability. We've seen gas here in the States anywhere from 4.50 to 2.20. If there was significant price manipulation, I would expect consistently high or low prices, instead they've been consistently inconsistent.   In addition, the transition from heavy crude to the light crude produced from fracking has lead to an oversupply of light crude.   http://m.bismarcktribune.com/bakken/breakout/domestic-oil-production-approaching-refinery-capacity/article_138e6dba-1342-11e4-bfe9-001a4bcf887a.html?mobile_touch=true  Also, US refining capacity has remained more or less stagnant, despite having more oil. Last four years it's gained only a few percent. Now compare that to the 15% gains we've had in oil produced from fracking and it begins to make sense that we just don't have the refinery capacity.   https://www.afpm.org/uploadedFiles/Content/Publications/Statistics/2014%20Refining%20Capacity%20Report.pdf  Refusing to build refineries could be a form of price fixing, by limiting means of production.

geopolitics,3d9puk,UpvoteIfYouDare,0,Thu Jul 16 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"at least truly competitive elections seems impossible when you only have two parties for hundreds of years   Most electoral systems end up with two overall competing factions. Even in multi-party systems, the various parties form coalitions which effectively lead to a pseudo-two party system. Just because there are two parties does not mean that an electoral system is not competitive. The number of parties is a shallow metric to use when making this judgement.   And free media... if by free you mean beholden to very select corporate interests, it is.   There are a myriad of outlets outside of mainstream media that are not ""beholden to very select corporate interests"". They are fully accessible for voters to view. The issue is not with the structure of the media, but with the culture of of the populace."
geopolitics,3d9puk,willkydd,3,Thu Jul 16 03:23:01 2015 UTC,"just because there are two parties does not mean that an electoral system is not competitive.    I was implying the reverse: two party system is a symptom of there being no real competition. The doctrinal difference between for example democrats and republicans is narrowly defined to sharp distinctions on very shallow topics like gun control, abortions, creationism and gay sex. There are many hot topics that are never discussed, such as poverty or eugenics (of the scientific type).   The issue is not with the structure of the media, but with the culture of of the populace.   You are right. Mainstream media are beholden to few corporations, but they are so relevant and mainstream because of the culture."

Do you realize, that nobody forced Greece to join EU or the eurozone? In fact, Greece did all it could to get into the eurozone and is doing everything it can to say in it, even if it means to temporarily surrender part of it's autonomy.  Have you ever wondered why Greece is going to hell and back to stay in the eurozone? If they leave and default on their debts, Greece will have the worst credit rating in Europe, hell, probably one of the worst in the whole world. And the problem is, that a modern country simply cannot work without debt (look at countries without external debt). It's not a perfect system, it has it's flaws, but that's just how the world progressed to be. Another problem is, that Greece is simply not competitive in todays world: they do not manufacture, grow or make anything particularly well or in large quantities, that's one of the reasons why they had to borrow mountains of money to survive, and even have an easy and luxurious life throughout 80s and 90s. Without the ability to get loans they will have to go through austerity, depression of economy and worst case- a complete collapse. That is why eurozone members are getting ready to send humanitarian aid to Greece in case of Grexit.  So, let's see what kind of precedent will a Grexit send*: destroyed credit rating, destroyed economy, war-zone like need for humanitarian aid, worse austerity than anything greeks experienced in the last 5 years.

Turkey knows Israel is important to their understanding of the power politics of the region, and it's not in their interest to piss them off.  The Turkish population demands Israeli blood for time to time, so the Turkish leadership is compelled to at least pay lip service to these sentiments publicly.   As to this specific incident, it's difficult to say.  Is it confirmed that it's an Israeli drone?  It could certainly be a look-alike, especially as this technology proliferates.  It could even be that Turkey is secretly buying Israeli drones to operate themselves.    I'm just speculating, though."

When the Afghan war started, supplies of 'white' heroin in Europe were severely affected. This caused a greater demand for lower quality, 'brown' heroin sourced from the Golden Triangle (mountainous regions covering Laos, Myanmar and Thailand).   Almost overnight, the Australian markets were severely diminished, as the European heroin market had suddenly opened up, and they pay a greater deal more than Asian markets do. Due to the decreased demand, Australia suffered a spate of crime and overdoses by desperate individuals stealing everything they could to pay for higher and higher prices, resorting to injecting anything they could get their hands on: Panadol, alcohol and by one account, bleach, simply to get 'some' kind of high. I have heard one LEO describe the period, when dazed vessels wandered the street like zombies, completely unable to get their hands on any gear.   This is an excellent example of geopolitics affecting faraway markets, subsequently affecting the health and wellbeing of a population. The fact that it's so invisible outside of medical and law enforcement circles is undoubtedly because it affects society's modern-day lepers. Fascinating."

So India would rather join Chinese-dominated AIIB as a way to get more voting power than be stuck with IMF/WB/ADB where it's less significant than even tiny Belgium.

""India is particularly interested because it lacks direct access to Central Asia, and it sees SCO membership as a way to get a better foothold on the region. SCO membership could better position India to benefit from Central Asia's gas riches,"" said Michael Kugelman, senior programme associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Wilson Centre in Washington. But he added: ""In (the) SCO, India and Pakistan wouldn't be dominant powers - China and Russia would retain that title.""  Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said: ""President Putin's efforts will enhance the political and economic scope of the Eurasian belt.""  The two leaders agreed in a separate meeting in Ufa that Modi would visit Pakistan next year.   I find it quite impressive how Russia has worked to improve China/India relations, and now along with the SCO and BRICS may also be able to improve India/Pakistan relations. It would be major to see a  security organization like the SCO become a interwoven and binding group. Like CTSO, but with multiple major military powers together, like Russia, China and India and to a lesser extent all of BRICS. It would be the most powerful and credible opposition and competition to NATO since the fall of the Soviet Union.   I think progress to integrate BRICS and Eurasia is quite fast really. The first BRIC(S) summit was only in 2009 and they have already created a major investment bank, improved intra-BRICS relations and trade. The SCO was founded in 1996, and in the past 5 years has added quite a few observer countries, and has added India and Pakistan to the SCO, expected to formally join in 2016.

In other words, we can be conscious of the things that influence our thinking, but we can't or even shouldn't necessarily escape them. If you're interested in this, a good primer is Psychology of Intelligence Analysis by Richards Heuer, available on the CIA website."

geopolitics,3d1wmx,Halp_pirats,15,Tue Jul 14 06:23:16 2015 UTC,"From r/india  I'll be brief and give you a few reasons.  But before that, let me just point out that the US supported Islamic extremism from the 50s through the 90s. Its only after 9/11 that they flipped on this issue.  US and Indian foreign policy:  1) US started supported Pakistan over India in the 50s because John Foster Dulles found the ""Abrahamic faith and discipline"" of its General Ayub Khan far more appealing than the ""weak-willed Hindu culture"" of Nehru. He also thought that the Gurkhas fought in the Pakistani army when he decided to support them. When told by the State Dept. officials that they fought for the Indian army, Dulles remarked, ""No worries. We'll get them to fight on our side.""  2) US support to Pakistan in the 1965 War.  3) US tacit support to Pakistan's army in the 1970-71 Hindu genocide in East Pakistan. About 500,000 to 1,500,000 million Hindu civilians were killed by by the West Pakistan dominated Pak army because they voted overwhelmingly for an East Pakistani political party. The (West) Pakistani incumbent government refused to recognize the electoral victory of the (Bangladeshi) Awami League and imposed marital law in East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Approximately 100,000 women were raped, and India was flooded by about 3,000,000 refuges.  4) US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. India decided to step into the East Pakistan genocide situation after Pakistan attacked India in a premptive Operation Chengiz Khan. Nixon decided to stop India from stopping the genocide by sending in a nuclear armed USS Enterprise and supporting British naval fleets. They only backed off after realizing that the USSR was tailing them with a nuclear submarine in the Bay of Bengal.  5) Nixon's sanctions on India for not ""allowing those scummy Indians and that evil bitch (Indira Gandhi) get away with what they did in East Pakistan.""  6) US sanctions for India's 1974 nuclear tests.  7) US support of the Afghan Mujaheddin against the soviets in the 1980s. The US left a battle hardened Mujaheddin and plenty of arms in Afghanistan. Pakistan's ISI used these Mujaheddin to step up infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir. These Mujaheddin used to travel freely betwen Afghanistan and Kashmir through Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province under the ISI's patronage.  8) US financial support for Pakistan's security establishment which used these funds to support terror camps in Kashmir. Terrorists infiltrated the LoC to engage in the massacre of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits. This resulted in 150,000 to 350,000 Pandits becoming refugees in their own country between the years 1988 and 1995.  9) US sanctions on India for conducting the 1998 nuclear tests.   10) US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the Kargil War. The US even turned off GPS signals for the Indian army during the war.  11) More recently, the 2005 Modi visa ban has also caused major issues. Modi imposed certain restrictions on anti-Hindu propaganda used by missionaries to convert poor, uneducated tribal people in his state of Gujarat. An unprecedented combination of evangelical, Islamic, and left-wing ex-pat Indian groups lobbied with the Bush administration to use the protection of religious freedom act (that was only used once - against Modi) to impose a preemptive ban on Modi. Of course, the reason cited was ""Modi's involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots"" but the real reason (restricting missionary propaganda) was never cited. Forget being found guilty for aiding/abetting the riots, the Supreme Court of India didn't even find enough evidence to convict Modi of ignoring his duty during the riots. Despite the Supreme Court's clean chit, the US didn't bother to overturn the visa ban undermining the authority of the Indian judicial system. Meanwhile, the US hobnobbed with mass murders, despots, and theocratic-authoritarian heads of state.  12) Hillary's use of European human-rights NGOs as a front to find ""mass graves of Muslims"" in Gujarat to implicate Modi between the years 2009 and 2012. The mass graves were found. But the bones collected as ""evidence"" turned out to be buffalo bones.   This obviously creates friction and resentment among Indians towards the West in general and the US in particular."

The Khalifa dynasty of Bahrain, like the rest of the GCC royal families, is a Sunni monarchy. Yet the majority of the population of Bahrain are Shia. More broadly, the GCC states, as absolute monarchies, have a clear interest in suppressing any internal dissent. Geographically Bahrain is located adjacent to the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Shia minority population of the country. The internal security situation in Saudi Arabia involving the government, the Shia population, and potential infiltration by ISIS and AQAP, is an existential threat to the House of Saud. The fear of Iranian mobilization of Shia throughout the Arabian peninsula has guided Saudi policy in Bahrain and now in Yemen."

The Saudis are terrified of post-Khalifa Bahrain inspiring separatism or all out revolt in Saudi's Shi'a population in the Qatif area."
geopolitics,3d2g9w,sageandonion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:13:16 2015 UTC,"This was actually a solid, roiling debate within the Al-Khalifa family itself. Until the Al-Saud family interjected and essentially drew a line in the sand. And when your largest ally/trading partner draws a line in the sand, you'd best find yourself on the correct side of that line.  So the answer to the question comes down to Riyadh's geopolitical point of view, which can be boiled down to NEVER giving Tehran even the remotest victory (at least on the Arabian Peninsula), even if the victory would have been derivative and optical, at best.  That said, for the purposes of running a viable and unified nation beyond the current century, the Government of Bahrain had every reason to negotiate with the protesters. Bahrain has fallen behind Qatar and Dubai in terms of viability in the international trading arena, and needed to put this down as quickly as possible, in order to avoid falling further behind. It chose to address it from a security perspective, which was effective in the short run, but merely prolongs the matter without resolving the underlying issue."
geopolitics,3d2g9w,WinstonWolf77,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Power. The only way the GCC and Bahrain functions as they are currently is by not absolutism. Their people have no say in anything at all. China and the USSR looks more democratic than they are.  If Bahrain got freedom or anything like that, the Saudis were worried it would hit home. Nobody likes them. They have to constantly bribe people with money, pretend to be Guardians of Sunni Islam, stir up fear of Iran and Shias while also distracting people by exporting conflict in places like Syria. That can only work for so long.  The fault also lies with the Bahraini opposition. From day one they were peaceful and pro-western. The Western government don't give a shit about them and actually wants them to fail. They should have sought help from Iran and used weapons."

geopolitics,3d2g9w,sageandonion,3,Mon Jul 13 10:16:00 2015 UTC,They're rubberstamp parliaments. Do you really take them seriously? The Emir of Kuwait can dissolve the entire thing if he wants to and he has multiple times. Technically he's supposed to call for elections in a specified time. In reality he can do whatever he wants and a few times he didn't even bother calling for elections in the time permitted and did it at his own leisure.  They're not even allowed to have any political parties.  Let's face it. While the US likes to talk about democracy and human rights. It's responsible for securing and protecting the most autocratic regimes the world has ever seen. Even the USSR wasn't this brazen and the Communist Party allowed ordinary people to join instead of hereditary rule. Playing by the rules in these countries gets nobody anything. The Bahrainis if they ever want freedom need to learn how to fight for it.

I mean NATO would obviously back Poland but does it as a whole give much of a shit about Albania (To be fair I know nothing about Albania's is strategic significance)?

This is directly threatening all NATO countries when we can not be sure that major countries in NATO are going to fulfill their responsibilities under the NATO agreement.  As for Ukraine there are many options and I think we could aid them without sending our own military into Ukrainian territory.  Some defensive weapons and nonlethal aid might be a good idea.

geopolitics,3cxrfd,freddiesehgal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"If this is an effort to deter China, as it clearly is, China can easily dominate and overpower Indonesia, so this just seems a bit superfluous.   If China attacks Indonesia it will be internationally condemned and may inspire US defense of Indonesia and international sanctions against China which would cripple its economy.   And Indonesia would receive condemnation, admittedly from different nations, if if were to act, so your point goes both ways.   Indonesia will not attack China because China is stronger and thus your point is ridiculous and irrelevant.   I was talking about the event of either side actually pre-emptively taking direct military action.  Both would be condemned.   Indonesia is not going to attack China. It has no reason to do so. It has already stood up to China and challenged their claim to the South China sea by planning to develop a military base in area claimed by China(but not internationally recognized) and also claimed by Indonesia(and internationally recognized)."

And ""Growth-killing structural reforms, together with fiscal austerity, have led to an economic depression"".  Varoufakis was right on this point  This leads to the conclusion saving Greece was never intended. The strong EU members and banks used Greece to make money for a decade and dumped Greece. This is interesting, because Greece don't recover from such a economic depression and it will have even consequences for Germany.

A member of the IMF is admitting that the loans were given to Greece to bail out banks, which caused a bigger problem than in 2010.    You need to read beyond the first paragraph.  You took one factual point (money was given to banks), and distorted it greatly.  The article points this out. 33% of the money given to the banks went to actual Greek depositors.  Regular people that had accounts with the banks.  From the article:  ""The bail-out did not however only benefit foreign banks, but also Greek depositors and households, as one-third of the debt was held by Greek banks and other Greek financial institutions.""   This leads to the conclusion saving Greece was never intended.    At the height of the financial crisis everyone was afraid of everything falling apart.  If Greece was not loaned money Greece itself would have been a much worse fall that did occur.   When some EU politicians believe, dumping Greece don't harm the EU and their own interests they must be stupid.    They know a Grexit will hurt the remaining Eurozone members.  The question is ""will it hurt worse that KEEPING"" Greece in the Euro.  Taxpayers in the other Eurozone members are the ones financing Greece right now.  How long is it fair to keep reaching for taxes from other Eurozone citizens while Greece itself collects only a fraction of the taxes it should from its own citizens?"

It seems like ForeignPolicy is really falling for various state medias' politicized views of this plan:   State media in both countries are already trumpeting the cooperation proposal and the SCO, with the Chinese state news agency Xinhua calling it a blueprint for “cooperation and prosperity of the whole Eurasian continent.” That marks quite a departure from Moscow and Beijing’s previous tug of war over influence in Central Asia.   Oh, Xinhua said so! It must be true! I think a following paragraph explains the deal as China sees it much more clearly:   “The Eurasian Union has not been the success Moscow hoped it would be,” said Anceschi. ... the bloc has been marred by trade disputes between Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia and has not delivered the economic stimulus promised to its members. “The Kremlin knows that they won’t be able to compete with Chinese investment,” said Anceschi. “Russia simply can’t catch up.”"

Most people began wondering if it was the Kremlin's propaganda outlet once it became obvious that its enemies were the very same things the Kremlin wanted to disenfranchise and it conveniently had the same goals as the Kremlin. Hence its silence on the Russian invasion of Georgia and its subsequent attempts at justification for it. It works together with ZeroHedge to advance the Kremlin's agenda.  There are two sources that provide a fairly indepth look at Global Research, and how it tries to advance the Kremlin's agenda. One from 'Stop Fake dot org' a Ukrainian-based fact checking site, which for obvious reasons can be somewhat biased, however it was set up to study/analyse the Kremlin's propaganda, such as Global Research.

Will the Soviet security apparatus that Putin has reassembled stand for Russia being subservient to anyone? Who knows.  To me, the melding of the BRICS/SCO is a desperate attempt by all parties involved to consolidate and expand their power in a time when all of their economies are bumbling along or crashing very hard and are thus deflecting public opinion with foreign adventures (see: Russia, China)."

geopolitics,3cutkl,WenchSlayer,3,Sat Jul 11 05:35:49 2015 UTC,"Not to disagree with the author, but he seems to put a lot of emphasis on the actions of Putin. The Euro crisis does relatively benefit Russia to some degree, but it has been entirely a failure of the West, not a result of any bifurcated power blocs.   Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia doesn't have anything to offer ideologically, hegemonic ally, or systemically. All they have is ""not West"". The fact that ""not West"" can be desirable is due to internal problems of the Western liberal system. Look at the EU now and back when it was first conceived. It is drastically neoliberal today, which naturally won't benefit many bust the already wealthy.   You can see similarities in the discourse on Ukraine. Sure there is some mention of liberal, capitalist democracy but since Ukraine was already relatively capitalist and nominally democratic the deeper issue was over corruption. In the West the assumption was the new elite are somehow inherently less corrupt than the oligarchs who are closer to Russia. Even on the other side there was socialists supporting the Russian backed rebels because they're fighting the ""capitalist fascists"".   Russia is surely someone for the West to watch, but the biggest fear of the Greece crisis is internal to the West, not in its relation to would-be competitors."

Perhaps the sanctions over Crimea are hurting the Russians less than they're helping the West.  Don't count on oil prices to remain low forever either. When they start to recover, so will Russia's ability to resist Western pressure to conform."
geopolitics,3cutkl,OB1_kenobi,2,Sat Jul 11 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"Don't count on oil prices to remain low forever either.   Oil prices will never return to the point they were at prior to late 2014. Higher prices make shale gas profitable, which in turn exerts downward pressure on price through higher levels of production."
geopolitics,3cutkl,UpvoteIfYouDare,2,Sat Jul 11 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"Shale exploiters can't be depended on to restart production.    Once a well has been tapped, the cost and production are immutable - the well will produce a large volume of gas in the beginning, and the flow will trickle off over a handful of years.  It can't be slowed down or turned off to save it for later extraction.  When Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil, it pulled the rug out from under shale production that could not be slowed down in existing wells and could not be sold for a high enough price to cover the costs of extraction.  If prices go back up, there is no reason Saudi Arabia could not repeat the maneuver and once again turn future shale wells unprofitable after the costs for those wells have already been sunk."
geopolitics,3cutkl,EfPeEs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Point taken. But you must agree that prices will rise to some degree. Let's suppose that they go back up to $75/barrel.   Every additional $/barrel must add a significant amount of money to Russia's budget. More money = more options. I imagine that, at $75/barrel, Russia could easily afford to step in and make a very attractive offer to the Greeks if they chose to do so."
geopolitics,3cutkl,OB1_kenobi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful about trying to predict a future oil price. Right now there are a myriad of factors that could push the price in either direction.  The issue with depending on fossil fuel exports to buttress a national budget is that the country's budget will be vulnerable to price fluctuations, and thus somewhat vulnerable to the interests of major oil producers. Saudi Arabia probably limited production somewhat so that prices would rise again due to their operations in Yemen, but if Saudi Arabia goes through a period in which they can afford to sell at lower prices and they aren't satisfied with Russian actions, they can just turn on the taps again. Alternatively, if prices rise enough, then the U.S. would increase production, which could also bring prices down again. If the Russian budget were made at a point in which oil price was at a high point and it drops afterward, that means that the budget would need to be redone.  Economic deals take a significant amount of time to go into effect due to negotiations and bureaucracy. If Russia were to try to work out a deal with Greece in the near future, it would still take months for both sides to follow through. If at any point in that time period the price of oil drops again, then Russia likely would be forced to either back out of the deal or slash the budget elsewhere. Given the Putin administration's desire to further modernize the Russian military, I doubt that it would reflect well on them to cut back on military spending. On the other hand, backing out of a deal they offered to Greece would look bad on the international stage."

Maybe Russia will grow in power, but until they have an ideological alternative to the liberal system all they can really do is heavy handed carrot/stick relations, which isn't going to extend very far beyond their immediate neighbours.   The power, unity, and system of the West is there to be lost from inside, not attacked from the outside (at the moment). The embedded liberal system held more inclusive and unitary policies due to fear of communism, but without the cold war it became pure economic logic. The west is throwing away a relatively peaceful, progressive, and profitable system for one that the few can gain over the many.

Creating failed states that the West won't touch, then buying out the biggest warlord (if they're not FSB already) has been a pretty difficult strategy to combat.   There's also the broader image: Many, many more innocent civilians died at the hands of Russian soldiers in Grozny at about the same time, and Russia saw this.

Right now China won't go further toward anything antagonistic to the system. The question is will the SCO evolve. Any time there is a whiff of economic elements they are all over the news. Since there is already police action in the SCO it wouldn't be too far out of possibilities that it will become more militarized.   Right now it isn't a challenge to the West, but all hegemonic wars has started with becoming a larger player in the system. Them it turns to claims of hypocrisy, criticisms of the system, demanding more say, claiming more control...etc  This is a region the West is relatively uninvolved with and, as of yet, the SCO are only regional powers, so geographically it couldn't be a challenge to the West, but we can analytically view it in its trajectory of being a great power club outside of the system.

Russia could have been made an ally had the west offered help in properly spreading the wealth of the USSR. But, alas we can only speculate so far.  Such a wasted opportunity though"
geopolitics,3cp7yj,pickingupmypieces,6,Fri Jul 10 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think it may have been a wasted opportunity, but I really cannot blame the West for the decisions it made. It was a very, very muddied time period, and was not nearly as clear cut as the Post World War Two period that it is often compared to. Germany was defeated and occupied by the allied powers, while Russia was never near that level of absolutely dominated. In the case of Germany, the Soviet Union was seen as a threat even before the war, and treating Germany gently in order to gain an ally in the already underway conflict was a no brainier. In contrast, China had not yet emerged as a threat, and in many ways it still hasn't. Certainly not to the existential threat to the Western world order that the Soviet Union manifested as.   Also, the lack of true rapprochement was not due slowly to Western actions. The West wanted democratic reforms to be tied to economic aid, and quite honestly the Russian government and its people were not quite comfortable with the pace of change the west wanted. The West wanted a democratic Russia, most likely reasons being that democracies really do go to war with democracies less, are more likely to maintain long term political stability, and is most compatible with a market economy. You can also argue that giving Russia the aid, with or without reforms, may have led to renewed confrontation anyway. Educated guesses can be made, but this is power politics and no one is clairvoyant. Nationalist forces could still have emerged in a democratic regime. Indeed, nationalism in liberal-democratic systems is not rare at all historically, though it has perhaps put a damper on it. Nationalism has even seen resurgence in Europe, particularly Greece, France, and Poland.   Finally, the goal of US foreign policy for the last hundred years in Europe has been to create a strong Poland and Eastern Europe between Russia and Germany. A state able to resist pressure from their stronger neighbors would hopefully reduce the chance for direct conflict between the two potential great powers. Such a state would also  be wary of forging too close of ties with land powers on its borders, and will always seek an offshore balancer as its primary long term ally. There are, therefore considerable balance of power reasons for allowing Poland into the Western and particularly the American defensive alliance. This argument begins to lose strength when applied to the Baltic states, Ukraine, and Belarus, however. The Baltics are probably too close to Russia for their comfort, and I believe their admission was the final nail that sealed Russian determination to resist NATO.   Overall, I don't think you can definitively say that an opportunity was lost. There may have been an opening, or this may have been more or less inevitable. And either way, hedging bets with NATO expansion was not an unreasonable move."
geopolitics,3cp7yj,darthpizza,5,Fri Jul 10 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"True, but my thoughts are rather than destroying the Russian economy with economic shock therapy (I am not totally convinced the Americans offered what they legitimately saw as good economic advice) they could have worked closer with the state industries to begin a more gradual privatization and modernization of the state industries. Granted a counterpoint could be made that shock therapy worked for the Poles and the Czechs but they have the fact they joined NATO muddying this  You're right that hindsight is 20/20, but I believe American triumphalism and poor management of the Yeltsin years is what landed us in the current geopolitical danger zone we are seeing now."

Russia is very dependent on fossil fuels, and the lack of diversification is probably Putin's single biggest failure.   That is quite false and a myth that dont want to die and I say that as an economist, seriously I dont get where people get that  According to the World Bank in 2000 ,  43% of the GDP of Russia depend on natural ressources now it has fallen to 16%  and it is on a donward trend, Oil and gaz were  over 50% of state revenue  but have fall to 27,4%. Top revenue sources is instead payroll taxes.  Export depend on ressources but the share is fallen with an average of 2% each years  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.TOTL.RT.ZS   Russia could have used that wealth much better   And they have , Russia has the highest GDP per capita in Easten Europe after Estonia(that they will catch in 5 years) this is coming from a country that had a GDP per capita of 5000 US$ 16 years ago and was bankrupt with a credit rate similar to Zimbabwe.  Russia indutrial production has grown by 50%, food production by 100%, pharmaceutical sector 10% per year and growth of export of non oil and gaz by 250%.   http://www.awaragroup.com/upload/awara-study-russian-economy.pdf  They are rebuilding their industrial base with almost disintegrated post USSR and will finish rebuilding by 2020.  Russia was effectively bankrupt as it owed more money to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) than it had in foreign currency reserves. Since then, Russia has achieved a virtual macroeconomic revolution to the point where it is one of the largest creditors of U.S. debt in the world. Its nominal dollar GDP has increased by more than a factor of six. Growth of this magnitude would equate to nearly a ten fold increase in GDP over the course of a decade.    World Bank data, IMF and OCDE show that the economy will perfrom in the next years and have systematically cut recession prediction for this year so much that they think growth will come next year.   The broad economic stagnation and massive income inequality   Yet the GINI coefficient  is quite similar to that of U.S and close to UK   and massive income inequality (Russia has the worst in the world) are central to Putin's aggressive foreign policies, which are chiefly aimed at distracting from Russia's poor domestic situation.

geopolitics,3cp7yj,Dolcester,5,Fri Jul 10 04:28:26 2015 UTC,"43% of the GDP of Russia depend on natural ressources now it has fallen to 16% and it is on a donward trend   It's 18%, according to your link, but the more important figures are exports and government revenue.  Nearly 70% of Russia's export earnings are from fossil fuels, and the government relies on fossil fuels for more than 50% of its revenue.  Which is why Russia's economy quickly slumped when the price collapsed this past winter, and why the World Bank predicts a recession for the next two years.   Oil and gaz were over 50% of state revenue but have fall to 27,4%. Top revenue sources is instead payroll taxes.   Where is that figure coming from?  It was 52% in 2012, and if it's fallen that much, it's because the oil price has plummeted, which says nothing for diversification.  Russia is simply borrowing more to plug the hole.   a country that had a GDP per capita of 5000 US$ 16 years ago and was bankrupt with a credit rate similar to Zimbabwe.   Much of that increase in per capita GDP is offset by the massive income inequality generated in Putin's era.  Russia's income inequality is now the worst in the world.  Things have certainly improved over the abject disaster of the 1990s, but that's much more true for a few Russians than it is for the country at large.   they think growth will come next year.   No they don't.  The World Bank is predicting a decrease by 0.3% in 2016, after a decrease of 3.8% in 2015.  Even Putin is telling Russians to expect a recession for the next two years.  Meanwhile, inflation stands at 15.8%, further reducing purchasing power.   False and that is isnt a problem since Russia’s net foreign assets exceeded are almost two times its total indebtedness not even close from western countries(that are far behind her)   Then Russia is going to need to bail out the regional governments that Moscow transferred its debt to, as some have already defaulted and many are essentially bankrupt.  It doesn't help that debt held by private Russian companies is now some 30% of GDP.  Western countries have the luxury of being able to withstand high debts because other people want their currencies.  No one wants the ruble, and Russia's political actions have essentially torpedoed its investment potential accordingly."

geopolitics,3cp7yj,Tengri45,2,Fri Jul 10 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"No I don't, but I'll explain why I see it this way.   It was those nations who pushed to join NATO, not the other way around it, see for example the V4 group during the 90s.  I would have see the move as provocative if they lobbied them to join, kinda like what happened to Spain.   For me Russia lost those areas because they used the stick when they should have used the carrot.   I understand them see those countries joining NATO as a provocation, but I think they can only blame on themselves if NATO got so close to their borders.   Now NATO it's on their borders and obviously Russia isn't happy with this, but they, maybe, could have avoided it if they acted differently.   So yeah, I blame a bit the others, especially the EU because it grew, and it's still at least doing it hopefully, so slow.  And it grew too close too the US when they should have kept them as an ally, and they should have also been friendlier with Russia.   But mostly I blame Russia, because, probably for some kind of Soviet nostalgia, fueled all this and now this is backfiring on them and on us too.   Sorry for my English."

geopolitics,3cp7yj,wastedcleverusername,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"After the fall of the USSR, Russia couldn't have done much, the anti russian sentiment was too strong and Russia was too weak.  Once we entered some years inside the 00' with Russia coming back strong again some bullying behavior started. For example in Estonia with the fuss about the Statue, the cyber attacks, not recognizing the occupation etc, or after the collapse with some fight in the Baltics. Also I think there was some kind of embargo against Polish meat? But I'm not sure.  But mostly what really scared those countries, and what is scaring them now, is the military intervention in Georgia or in Moldova, and now in Ukraine.  If eastern Europe countries didn't join NATO, what guarantee would they had that Russia wouldn't attack them?  They wouldn't have any guarantee, and if I was a guy in eastern Europe in the 90's I would pray to join NATO."
geopolitics,3cp7yj,Antorugby,2,Fri Jul 10 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"I'm vaguely aware of some of these incidents, but didn't these happen after they were already admitted to NATO? You can't say they were driven to join NATO because of something that happened afterwards. It seems to me that Russia regarded those areas as already lost.   Just because countries apply to NATO doesn't mean they should be admitted. NATO should've had the foresight to see how admitting them would be taken by Russia. If they are aligned with Western Europe, Russia feels insecure and vice versa. Should've let the ex-Soviet states create an new alliance for themselves, with an NATO guarantee if they are attacked by Russia and vice versa. The only long-term solution is a neutral middle ground."
geopolitics,3cp7yj,wastedcleverusername,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"After the fall of the Soviet Union those countries were of course lost, there weren't much places that loved the Russian after the fall of the USSR.   What I mean is that if Russia behaved differently with those countries during these years the NATO problem in the east wouldn't have been a problem.   20 years are nothing when we talk history, in my opinion Russia should have waited a lot more and used his soft power to reach closer ties to the EU.   As far as I'm aware of its been 10 years the Baltics are in the NATO and not much military movement happened on their soil, now after the Ukrainian situation everything is changing with more countries who may join, Finland for example.   So I think if Russia didn't want NATO on his borders, it didn't do, and It's not doing, the right moves to reach his goal.   Again, in my opinion they would have reached better results with using their soft power, it's not like NATO would have started bombing Moscow just because the Baltics joined the alliance.   Maybe they should not have let those countries join, but they were aligning with the West, they were joining the EU, it was sort of ""natural"" to join the NATO and it would have happened anyway, those countries were really pushing to join.

I don't condone any warfare at all, but I don't think morality is really applicable in the field of geopolitics, so if you want to convince me you will have to show why it is not in Russia's interests to back moderate rebels against what they consider an illegitimate regime in the east, and why it was not in their interest to annex Crimea.  Morality is not applicable when discussing the interactions of states who may have wildly varying moral codes. Of course we can stay inside our own perspective and call them illogical, evil, irrational, and so on, but that's not very interesting to me - it's better to accept that everyone acts according to their own interest and not according to some higher purpose."

I want a big EU that doesn't let other countries put their feet on it's head and I hope Russia, and the others, start to respect that.  I think that letting Russia get away with eastern Ukraine can only mean a geopolitical loss for the EU. Next time the EU try to put in place a big operation that it's not in Russian interests what will they do? Surrender again and let Russia ""win""?

I'm not an analyst, a strategist or someone who works for big governments, if you are and you think Russia gained from this situation good for you, I from my humble pov think that Russia didn't gain much and ruined a lot of what it has done in the past years.

Russia seems to think so.   “The unprecedented external political and economic pressure is the price we have to pay for our position,” Mr. Medvedev said. “But everyone, the authorities and our society, realized that no matter the cost, we had no other way.”   I haven't seen any analysis of the situation that takes Russia's economic and security interests into account which comes to any conclusion other than that Russia had no choice but to act in Ukraine.  Do you think that the Russians didn't expect these sanctions? Or that any of our responses have been surprising to them or unpredictable? I haven't seen any evidence that we have done anything that they couldn't have predicted. Even their currency (often cited as the main evidence of Western winning-ness) hasn't really been knocked off of the long term trend by these events (when compared to the cost of commodities - I'm not sure comparing USDRUB is really useful now that Russia is becoming isolated from US markets).  As evidence of this you can note that their first response to sanctions was to sanction themselves from food imports  - the sanctions imposed by the west didn't even go as far as Russia was expecting them to."

I get a chuckle whenever I see this line of reasoning. NATO is the good guy. No eastward encroachment here, nothing to see, move along.  Seriously, just because a former Warsaw Pact nation wants to join NATO doesn't mean they have to be accepted for membership. Yet, in many cases, NATO has chosen to add them one after the other.  Of course the Russians have been noticing over the last 20 years. Ukraine was differnet. Why? Because a Ukraine joining NATO would have put a powerful European military alliance right on Russia's border. It would have also cost them their naval base in Crimea and (between Turkey and Ukraine) choked off access to much of the Black Sea.  Every nation has limits to what it will tolerate re; it's security and national interests. For Russia, Ukraine was simply one step too far, or too close if you will.

Um, yeah... I am guessing it's only alarming because the US dominated unipolar world is being challenged. It doesn't matter how anybody feels about these matters but this is what is going on, there is a balance of power dilemma arising. The US and countries that support/allow hegemony are starting to worry about a possibility of multipolar world. It's not just Russia, there is Chinese dilemma as well with their artificial island building in international waters. Plenty of people are totally fine with US led unipolar neoliberal politics but plenty are not okay with it. It's not that Russia is a top US national security threat, it's just US is being contested on the world stage. I personally think that this whole Crimean issue is not that important. It was one of the few territorial disputes after the fall of USSR. You just can't expect countries to sit idle after empires crumble. Borders are not always re-drawn properly and cultural differences are not being taken accountable for, it's natural for these things to arise and realign with time. Crimea is one of them. Then there is Ukrainian coup, of course it will make things more tense. Potential NATO expansion, etc. It looks like some high ranking officials in the US are waking up to harsh reality that some countries are not going to sit back and watch their national interests crumble right in their sphere of influence, it's kinda silly and naive.

I hope you're aware that Kissinger masterminded the Sino-American rapproachment as a way to leverage the Sino-Soviet split to America's favor in the Cold War. It was pure geopolitcs, not benevolent generosity to develop a fellow country.  You know who else predicted China's rise? Napoleon. Almost 200 years ago.   The U.S. Doesn't have an internet troll army ,like Russia ,who posts articles with titles bragging about the U.S. relationship with China .   Yes. It does.   A coup to label the political transition in Ukraine is innacurate . Once again , Russia had a propped government with corruption embedded on every level with no development opportunities for its citizens. Russia has proven it would never transition from a situation like this and we see this in Syria right now . A spark was ignited in Ukraine, changes have occurred, and the necessary political transition is underway . I assure you that in 10-15 years Ukraine will be far ahead than what she would have been with the previous propped corrupt government. It is a coup only labeled this way by Russia's internet army . I also assure you that NATO would rather develop Ukraine for the benefit of its citizens than risk a confrontation with Russia to harm them.   So a ""Russia propped government"" is wrong but a US backed one is right? You do know that corruption has more to do with a nation's culture and developmental status rather than its political system right? Plenty of corrupt democracies out there. Maidan and the Orange Revolution had American influence involved in them. Nothing in this world functions in a vacuum, especially in strategic hotspots."
geopolitics,3cp7yj,resavr_bot,3,Fri Jul 10 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Your comment on Kissinger again shows the problem with the Russian mindset as viewing the world in a black and white win or loss versus the West as if the U.S. Policy was that simple and only a conspiracy to defeat the Soviet Union. The U.S. Policy considered many and all variables and poor policy by the Soviet Union is why the Soviet Union ""lost"".   Reality isn't black and white yet you seem to paint a rather black picture for Russia. Which is why I merely pointed out that your ""whites"" are far from being pristine and actually gray in reality. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War had one priority and it most certainly was the USSR. The strategies and methods implemented during this period were by no means simple but they shared commonality in their prevailing theme, to win the Cold War.   The U.S. Prediction of China's rise in the 1950s was based on real context of the current time period and the analysis of the minds of the different social classes in China , their relationship with the Communist government and how it operates , the populations educational development , and the industrial infrastructure . Yes Napoleon ""predicted"" a rise but it wasn't a practical prediction for geopolitical strategy .   You seem to portray U.S. policy makers of having a grand strategy understanding and puppetmaster responsibility in the shaping of Modern China. Let's start off with the insultingly denominated ""Loss of China"" to the CCP, as if American interests should have prevailed over Chinese rights to self-determination, suggesting they lost something that was rightfully theirs to begin with. The US failed to install a KMT government in mainland China, so they  stubbornly refused to recognize the PRC and had the entire world following this charade for 3 decades. Let's not forget when America was shocked about Chinese involvement in the Korean War. A violent retaliatory pushback against an aggressive push into their buffer? Sounds very familiar. I find it hard to believe how foreign policymakers made such strategic blunders when they had this allegedly deep understanding of China's future developmental path. *Napoleon was just an example to illustrate how a Chinese re-emergence had been historically recognized prediction and was in no way an insight into US brilliance.   If the U.S. Has a troll army then it behaves differently . Why do I not see articles bragging about the U.S. / China relationship if this army exists ? Why do I only see articles bragging of the Russia / China relationship , when again , it is only skin deep and likely just practical geopolitics . Russia posts more articles with catchy headlines that work well for propaganda to the simple reader and if the U.S. Has a troll army then they don't do this very often . Russia's troll army does its best to make it seem Russia is always proud and if the U.S. Has a troll army then they don't do this any I see more articles of US policy being self criticizing. Looking past this, your comment doesn't dispute the high activity of Russia's troll army and I've been critisIed for calling them out . I will refrain from this and will resort to only logic in arguments.   You made a statement, which was patently false. The US does just as much ""trolling"" as Russia does.  Propaganda is alive and well on both sides. I don't dispute nor criticize Russian activity in their local and international media. My intention was to simply dispel the notion that the US did not employ these tactics as well.   Not saying the U.S. Backed one is right , but the action for a political transition follows precedent and with no transition we would continue to experience Russia repression in Ukraine . Russia's strategy is a new standard , a standard I initially respected to an extent , but a standard which Russia isn't willing to allow any other group to use in other areas of the world . The double standard by Russia is the main issue I have and especially when the double standard has no purpose and is freezing a conflict for no real development .   By ""double standard"" you mean hybrid warfare? Russia's strategy directly imitates Western methods so the only problem I see is needless violence in the name of geopolitical interests. Funny how the West denounces their own methods isn't it?   Please explain your last sentence in more detail .   Ukraine is suffering the fate of many other nations unfortunately situated in the battle lines of conflicting interests. You can see this historically in regions that were caught in the crossfires of greater international interests and divided between two opposing camps: Germany, the Korean Peninsula, Vietnam, Kashmir, Cyprus and so forth. Their internal conflicts had an element of foreign intervention that simply cannot be denied. So to think that Ukraine's Maidan had zero foreign involvement (especially American and European) in it is naive and denies contentious evidence that argues quite the contrary in fact."

This was no accident, despite this aspect being lost on certain peoples.   China may have a larger economy, but they have more mouths to feed.  As more people come to expect more of their government, the economic clout of the world's other economies will be tied up in providing for their citizens, all while our planet continues to lose resources.  Expect the US / West to lost the title of dominant economic entity, but in that process, become a much more mature entity with significantly higher standards of living than the sardine cans of China and India.

The ability of highly motivated individuals to enter the elite class is not the measure of a nation, although it is a credit to us that we retain some level of social mobility.  The US is going to become a ""majority minority nation"" in the coming decades. I am NOT making a racist statement here. However, the economic inequality between whites and Asians on one hand and blacks and Hispanics on the other hand is a stark fact. The median net worth of black households in the US is only $11,000. For Hispanics, it is $13,700. A large percentage of black and Hispanic youth are not growing up in a two-parent household and are not going on to higher education or are not completing high school altogether. The white middle class is also coming apart at the seams. There is a bifurcation between the upper middle class and the working class. For social mobility and cohesion to be real, it needs to mean that these two groups are fluid with each other, and also that anyone who wants to get educated or find full time work can do so. I think this also indicates that the greatest measure of social mobility and cohesion is whether the poor can become stable members of the working class.   The debt levels for households and non-financial businesses is very high. And with increasing student loan debt, young people are burdened with debt very early in life now. All of this has negative implications for an economy that is made up by over two-third of consumer spending. And this means not just a cell phone and a laptop, but a car, a house, and all the trappings of a middle class lifestyle. If this is out of reach for some, or delayed for others, the American economic engine is going to slow down. An American society characterized not by the booming and inclusive middle class, but increasingly by the elite and the poor, where the upper middle class has more in common with the elite and the working class has more in common with the poor, is going to be a polarized and dysfunctional society, especially if a lot of this occurs along racial lines as well."

No, you can't call China a textbook definition of a totalitarian regime, being that it's double sided political structure externally allows for a more international liberal capitalist political intercourse, but on the inverse, seated somewhere within, is certainly an aggressive war machine. eg, government funded hacking, nefarious economic manipulation, abhorrent labor conditions, a total lack of infrastructure or environmental programming or provision, then the geoeconomic seizure on land and economies that don't belong to them for perpetuation of their already aggressively militarized state. is there something I'm missing?   absolutely China presents itself as a major threat to its neighbors--it presents a threat to the entire world.

To let a regime with such a record of terrible behavior create a sprawling and internationally relevant economic system which, undoubtedly will uphold the development of the next multiple generations of technological and infrastructural development is more than a mistake, it's an international crisis, and it doesn't take an expert to see that.   without writing a novel, this is going to allow China to dominate non-compliant, independent Asian states, create absurd programs for developing states, impose absurdly devastating sanctions, override international law, develop more aggressive international military deployment, and control enough policy to create an impact from which will assuredly devastate any free state, first world or not.   bad. very bad."

Where as the PRC isn't and doesn't.  It's actually bad for the PRC domestically to support democratic /human rights/liberal movements abroad which is not good for the citizens in it's neighboring countries.    I'll go as far as to draw comparisons to Nazi Germany or the USSR..  Their hegemony wasn't ""good"" for many of the people in their sphere of influence BECAUSE of their ideology.   I would say that this is a quantitative measure as well.   Furthermore, we KNOW that liberalism and pluralism are GOOD for the people who live under those governments.

Most of the areas of the world where liberalism and political pluralism are possible and encouraged at the state level are nations that are allied to the US/West.   The US in the 20th century did more to subvert democratic movements than any other state. To say that the US was ""obligated to foster democracies, civil and human rights with its hegemony"" is pretty baffling.   You say this but you don't provide any examples to the contrary.  What nations did more to promote not just necessarily democratic movements, but inclusive governments more so than the West did?     Given the choice between a US-friendly dictator and a democratic regime, they chose the former every time.   No given the choice between a US-friendly dictator and a communist ""democratic"" regime, they chose the dictator in order to avoid more states falling into the USSR sphere.   It's pretty obvious, that when politically possible the US did foster democracy/liberalism in other states.  Japan, Germany, Taiwan and South Korea are great examples of this.  When the USSR conquered and created new states after WW2 they were non-inclusive and strictly under the thumb of Moscow, quite the opposite of what the US did.

I think this is foolish; how could one possibly overlook the progressive development of a corrupt and detrimental organization? then further to say it's a good thing? on what grounds? any such grounds are only speculative, and perhaps may show promise initially, so to develop economic stability and dependency, but this will assuredly lead to destruction of the even now struggling fight for global peace in the international political institutions and the international relations environments."

It's as if they don't understand the interests and dilemmas that have guided the behaviours of states since Thucydides.  I actually happen to agree very much with the video - (I forget whether it was Nye or Mearsheimer who said this), but China's behaviour will mirror that of other powerful states in history, including its own when it was powerful.  And this is not something that the world needs to panic or fear - nor is it something the world should just ignore.  Rather, it should be understood - objectively, without emotional attachment.  As Mearsheimer notes, the Chinese are a culture of realists.  Engaging them using a realist mindset will probably produce better results than arguing over liberal ideals that are not necessarily consistently upheld by liberal states.  That's not to say liberal values should be completely thrown out the window.  But the means to fulfill these values lies in the realist toolset when dealing with China."

I don't think, if you'll read my comment below, that these high minded conversations about economics, geography, power, or authority can be made contextually relevant unless you consider the political element, which, is very relevant, considering the socioeconomic, technological-infrastructural, political-militaristic development of the current state as well as the foreseeable 21st century, and, to be honest, in this instance, I don't see Thucydides being of much relevance."

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I believe that your argument has already steered any attempt at dialogue over China's rise towards the wrong direction.

geopolitics,3cn81q,i_already_forgot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"totally valid and appreciated criticism, I always appreciate an opportunity to sharpen my arguments. You're right, there is a slant in my dialogue against the rise of china, and no, it doesn't pay much attention to realist dilemmas, which I believe are falsely objective.  This slant, can be contextualized in my statement: I believe any superpower acting such in such a manor is a major detriment. I should clarify here, and hopefully it will resonate, that I believe the same things of the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the EU. Why? Because, at some point, behind each of these very specified examples of IR theory and practice, that which we've discussed here in this thread, lies an economic, geographic, authoritarian policy that inherently must impose on some system somewhere so to extract wealth and power. I know this won't be a popular opinion, I believe it's a mistake to ignore this, and more to the point, I think that ignoring the implications of these relations, and therefrom speculating on the unpredictable and building only unassuming niceties, i.e, in this conversation, that the introduction of the AIIB will allow for great economic and infrastructural growth, is part of the reason why there is such a need for speculating on the very social behavior that allowed such political err to begin with. It isn't difficult to see that many countries, debatably China, has woven a series of outwardly positive IR policies bent around a totalitarian regime. Personally, this is plain text.  Some perfect examples of this have already been shown, so I won't reiterate them, but I will add to them. Firstly, to address security (in the way in which china is claiming the need to address security); it doesn't make sense, in the position China is in, with no real pressing militaristic need, that they would need to expand their standing military power: they have the worlds largest military power. Any contrary argument is moot, as no one is attacking them, no one is even considering it; therefore, having a speculative IR conversation about this, only gives more potential to the reality of this happening, instead of the opposite conversation, wherein we speculate the decrease of the need for a militarized. Naive, you may say (I do not), but if there is to be an appropriate conversation in an appropriate environment, it is the IR conversation on China's rise.  Secondly, in regard to the AIIB, I just don't see how it could end positively, considering that there is already so much financial calamity and careful balancing of currencies and markets, that the introduction of a China-based financial infrastructure could possibly lead to anything progressive, other than the PRC executing a range of slight manipulations which would benefit their need for economic stability.  That said, I'm all for economic stability, but just not China's, and for a very important reason: because totalitarian regimes are destructive. Consider for a second what they're doing now, and they aren't even economically stable: invading independent territory and claiming it as their own, building an unnecessarily large military, manipulating markets, supporting other totalitarian regimes, oppressing their population, destroying their environment, creating international disease via policy, the list goes on. The problem with giving China more power and stability than it already has is that, that it's a totalitarian regime, that power and development isn't going to benefit the people, it's going to benefit the state, which, in turn is going to continue to do the things it's been doing before to a greater degree. This too, I believe, is plain text.  Thirdly, we have to evaluate why China is doing the aforementioned things. The answer is clear: concentrated geopolitical-economic prowess. This topic isn't spoken enough about directly: What does this look like, and what implications does it carry. At this point, conventional means of speaking about politics break down into a series of patterns, which, if abiding to those patterns, a nation can do whatever it wants, which is exactly what China is already doing, but cannot continue to do indefinitely, the way it wants to, in the current power situation it is in now. Such a concentrated power can be manipulated into many different forms, and be it that it would be in the hands of a totalitarian regime, that power would be used to, as I mentioned, propagate that totalitarian subversion, now, indefinitely, or at least very close.  The problem is we just don't know. The current IR-political scheme has had a consistent developing power concentration for quite some time, and with the implications that the AIIB carries, that it would in fact bolster China to the absolute world power, is a very large variable that I don't think should be speculated lightly."

Security concerns, in the case of North Korea it was a mix of ideology and safeguarding the integrity of the nation.

Beijing, in support of the Khmer Rouge, retaliated by launching a cross border incursion into northern Vietnam.   Yet they still managed to prop up the North Korean regime and Pol Pot among others. This was during an active genocide in Cambodia.   That is the thing you assume that the PRC mentality and ideology is the same as in 1950 and 1970 when Maoist were still in power.

geopolitics,3ckhda,deuxglass1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yes officially the project is opened but a few questions remain, notably the price China will pay for Russian gas. Currently China can get gas from Turkmen at a much cheaper rate than what Europe pays for Russian gas. This puts pressure on Russia to sell gas at a big discount and the Chinese are driving a hard bargain. Some rumors indicate 1/2 to even 1/4 of what Europe pays for gas. Gazprom favors a pipeline through the Altai because it would generate much more profit and flexibility however Putin needs a foreign policy win these days so he nixed Gazprom's' idea and went with the Far East solution. The pipeline will get built but Russia will get less profit from it. In essence Russia is replacing high-profit gas sales to Europe with low-profit sales to China. Who gets the best part of the deal?"
geopolitics,3ckhda,Kameniev,7,Mon Jul 13 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"This is more or less as I've been arguing for some time. I might refrain from calling it a mirage, since some tangible things are happening, and China's non-support of Russia in the Security Council isn't anything new—in fact, it's China's default position when its interests are not directly challenged.   The key to their relationship is recognising that while Russia is keen to develop it in all directions, it really needs Chinese money, especially if it continues to distance itself from Europe (or vice versa), and wants to play it off as Russia's inexhaustible 'other option'. In reality, China is no 'friend in need', and only co-operates with Russia when the odds are stacked significantly in its favour: the pipeline deal, though significant and of mutual interest, is a huge win for China in relative terms. One should watch China's moves into Central Asia, as the author rightly notes; its attempts to gradually wean itself from the Russian defence industry; its refusal to militarise their shared Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, or to allow it to be used for Russia's political ends—all of these betray the real Sino–Russian alliance, and there's little reason to believe it'll get better in the future."
geopolitics,3ckhda,joerobo,5,Thu Jul 9 09:55:36 2015 UTC,I'd disagree that its a mirage.  The long term forces and incentives bringing them together certainly aren't.

Maybe because instead of borrowing money to lay waste to an entire continent, the Greeks are guilty of trusting German/French banks with lending them money to buy (mostly) German/French products. The same banks that weren't bailed out because Germany and France managed to shift all the blame to the borrowers, effectively making the Greek/Portuguese/Irish taxpayer the full culprit for bad lending practices from the big European banks and the incompetence/corruption of their own ill-elected politicians.   I agree that both situations aren't similar. Greeks deserve more empathy and solidarity now than the Germans did back in the 50s. And because i'm glad Europe remembered WWI and did not repeat the same mistake twice with Germany, i also believe that demonizing the Greeks now is going to come back and bite Europe in the proverbial ass later.  I get that Germans get very antsy every time someone mentions WWII, but those that forget history are destined to repeat it.    Oh, and bind any kind of debt relief on a guarantee of trade- and budget-surpluses.

History has taught us over and over again that you can't trust the Germans with power. They toppled the Western Roman Empire and promptly ushered in the Middle Ages before fragmenting to infighting. They're finally reunified in the 19th century and they start WWI within fourty years. They recover from WWI and immediately start WWII. They're reunified in the wake of the Soviet fall and within thirty years they've traded military imperialism for the economic flavor by using financial markets and ""democratic"" (but German-dominated) organizations to bend other nations to their will.  Sympathy for the German people is wildly misplaced, as are comparisons between their former situation and Greece's."

""Those damn dirty Krauts are all power-mad Jew-killers"" is racist because it unfairly characterizes the entirety of the population based on negative sterotypes.  ""The German state has, consistently throughout time, shown a propensity for coercive imperialism in international affairs"" is simply an observation. Also at no point do I insist that they shouldn't be allowed to have any amount of power - just that their actions in the past have given us very little reason to trust that they'll wield it responsibly when they obtain it.  Case in point, the current Greek fiasco. The entire Greek economy (not debt, economy) represents less than two percent of the Eurozone GDP. Do you really think this is the unsolvable problem Merkel wants us to think it is, or is it more likely that Germany is attempting to make an example of Greece to keep the other EU debtor nations in line? Germany sits atop the economic pyramid of Europe, and they're choosing to use that position to coerce other nations into doing their bidding.

The Germanics were not the awe-inspiring tidal wave of destruction that they have been made out to be. They were at the mercy of the Huns and later Avars for centuries, and their petty squabbles during the Middle Ages were not nearly as disastrous as has been portrayed.   I love how the poster also blames WWI on Germany, completely leaving out the complicit Serbs and AH Empire, and that WWII was brought about as the result of punishing Germany too harshly for a war they never even started.

geopolitics,3cj3bb,Kameniev,11,Wed Jul 8 08:35:39 2015 UTC,"So, as a Greek citizen, this has been interesting.  There are many who claim this whole situation isn't so simple as Greeks being lazy; there's more to it.  And they are right, when you look closely its not so simple.  That being said.  I can remember going to rural Crete as a younger kid (dual US citizenship) and visiting one of my grandfather's villages.  Everyone took like 4 month vacations and a 4 hour siesta every day.  People retired in their 50s and got a pension nearly equal to their maximum pay for the rest of their often not short lives.  People would be getting unemployment from the government with new Audis parked in their driveways.    What I most distinctly remember is how derisive the attitude was towards northern Europeans and Americans for working as much as they did.  'They don't live.' 'They waste their lives.' 'They have bad priorities.', etc.  I can personally assure you, the culture of laziness and entitlement people are talking about is a very real thing.  And even still, there are a lot of people in Greece who have convinced themselves they did nothing wrong, and that poor little Greece is getting taken of advantage again by some foreign power.  There are a lot of politicians telling them they should be convinced as well.  It truly makes me question the popular narrative of many of the issues in the developing world being caused by colonial or outside forces.  Change starts at home; the corollary might be fortune is made or broken for a nation by its culture.  Greece has a culture of entitlement and the victim mentality.  But they have no one but themselves to blame for this at the end of the day."

geopolitics,3cj3bb,iamthegodemperor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the anecdote! It does put a more granular perspective on the 98% tax evasion bit.  It also puts the austerity bent on the Greek welfare state into some better perspective. I don't think one has to agree with it, but targeted austerity can be useful if your desire is to reduce future liabilities---(and you are confident that future growth will catch up to the immediate GDP shrinkage)  But this:    'They don't live.' 'They waste their lives.' 'They have bad priorities.', etc.   It's not entirely wrong criticism....There is a lot of wasted life in North America and Europe. But it's not the desire to work that is the issue. At least in the US, it's more short-sighted policies that encourage millions to make undo sacrifices to health for work. Obviously, there will always be some population of incapacitated elderly persons. But those who reach retirement in poor health are a far greater proportion than is necessary. This kind of sacrifice, that drags down GDP and  lowers quality of life across the lifespan. Maybe given our political systems, this was unavoidable....  I do have a real question:  Given the difference between average & median income in Greece (wealth inequality). How representative is your grandfather's village?"

geopolitics,3cj3bb,Synaps4,3,Wed Jul 8 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"Not a very good article.  It completely sidesteps the core of the issue, which is the original over-borrowing that happened.  Why were all these creditors in greece in the first place?  Because greeks asked for them to be there, is the answer. Greeks promised they could pay, and trusting the system the bankers gave loans.  Turns out the greeks couldn't pay.    Therefore, when the eurozone steps in and pays those loans on greece's behalf, you can't say it's ""bypassing"" greece.  Functionally, it's being paid to greece and the greeks immediately using it to refinance the debt they had.  (because that was the deal worked out to get the refinancing from europe in the first place).  If I can't pay my loans, and my friend steps in front of me at the bank and says ""I'll cover him, and he can pay me next week"" no one should be surprised when he cuts his check to the bank, but this article seems surprised that bailout funds were not spent on giving random greeks extra money.  Bottom line, the money went to pay loans greeks had agreed to pay and couldn't.  Obviously, the people who asked for those loans in the first place are critical to the equation, and they (the greek loan originators) are missing from the article completely."
geopolitics,3cj3bb,iamthegodemperor,2,Fri Jul 10 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"The link between the financial crisis and the consequences for Greece needs to be more fully articulated (and more often):   Greece was thus a mere conduit for a bailout. It was not a recipient in any significant way, despite what is constantly repeated in the media. Of the roughly 230 billion euro disbursed to Greece, it is estimated that only 27 billion went toward keeping the Greek state running"
geopolitics,3cj3bb,Ketchupninja,2,Wed Jul 8 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and while I don't sanction giving Greece an easy time, people should start recognising that the Germany and France are doing what states do, not acting out of enlightened benevolence: They're protecting their banks, and trying to keep the Euro whole, though this is a secondary objective."

I'm specifically referring to the fact that after the house market crashed in the US and the great recession began the Greeks finally admitted to ""understating it deficit figures for years"". Therefore, the Greeks would have been in some serious shit if the trioka didn't choose to bail them out. But of course that help came with conditions for the Greeks, mainly austerity and financial reform.    Any way the article chooses to condemn the EU for structuring the bail out so that the most of the money went to pay Greeks creditors instead of to the Greek government/people, but to me that makes sense. If German and French banks were to suffer the whole EU financial system suffers. Therefore, its better to keep the incident isolated to Greece and allow the rest of the system to keep going."

Greek deficit was well known, since every new government took great pleasure in revealing how over-spent their predecessor was, but the lenders gleefully lent away--then got off more than scot-free. It's a pretty fascinating situation, and I don't really want to side with a bloated, nepotistic regime/class grasping at shadows on which to pin blame for their own failings, but I do have some sympathy."

They will do what is best for them. EU has much more advanced technology than China or Russia so there will be a great opportunity for our companies. However I don't think we will have any influence or political sway over Iran and the relationship will be strictly commercial.  The US will have some influence not because the Iranians like them but because of fear. There will never be any great relationship because the current political generation was forged in Saddam's war. They're pragmatic but there is only so much you can stomach when you consider the other side to have helped gas your people.  There is also the shackle of Saudi Arabia and other sectarian states. The US can' abandon them for Iran because these countries are effectively puppet states whereas Iran is more independent. An Iranian government will never buy useless billion dollar toys and hire expensive western experts unlike Saudi Arabia.  China won't have that problem. They don't like Saudi Arabia and they know SA is firmly in America's side. They're already going out of their way to reduce gulf products they buy. Linking Iran to their Eurasia pocket will be of the up most importance.   The only way I can see the west gaining influence in Iran is through India. These two countries have a remarkably amicable relationship. The only thing hampering the relationship has been western sanctions and Indian lack of funds compared to China. If the west wants to counter China's influence in Iran they should support Indian efforts in the country.
geopolitics,3cj9u3,i_already_forgot,2,Wed Jul 8 10:35:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Chinese approach in this particular sector is based on the ""win-win"" formula.  They aren't trying to have exclusive access to Iranian markets or lock Iran into an alliance.  In such a situation, there is little anyone can do to stop the Iranians from accepting.  Even so, it isn't a zero sum situation for the west.  There can still be engagement - and Iran will want to engage all the powers equally for maximum benefit.  The problem is when you start to take a zero sum look at things - forcing the Iranians to take sides unnecessarily will probably not be beneficial."

The article frequently talks about it potential as a freight/commerce corridor between E.Asia and Europe, but no support (even anecdotal) is provided.   I could see C.

The Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank might participate in a partial bailout to raise its profile against the IMF but it wouldn't be a good long-term move.  I could see Putin doing it to line up with his arms sales and forays against the Western sphere of influence but he's already running into a wall on available capital unless he's willing to tap into his personal network of a rumored $40 billion in indirectly owned assets to do so.

But this part strikes me as true:   Finally, there are American hedge funds and private equity firms. They are cash-rich because of European, Chinese and Middle Eastern money searching for safety and are facing near-zero percent interest rates. Many of them have taken wilder risks than this. The U.S. government might not discourage them, either, because it would be far more concerned about Russian or Chinese influence - and navies - in the eastern Mediterranean.  Having shed its debt to Europe and weathered the genuinely difficult months after default, Greece might be an interesting investment opportunity.

There was a video that shows a person running out from the bust and triggering the land mine. The damage doesn't add up if we were to believe official UA narrative.   Anyway, there is a lot of gray area and the ""fog of war"" is real. There has been multiple false reports from UA government through out the conflict.

I know it wasn't really an article about Russia (despite the title), and thus some simplifications are to be expected, but it's a little dangerous to pin the rise of Putin to failures in the West. Yeltsin was no good guy; he, and practically all of his government were dedicated communists until it stopped being fashionable—they're dedicated ultranationalists now in Putin's cabinet. There was so much wrong with Russia at the time, and while the West could have done more, it's easy to see why pouring more money into such a system was unpalatable to say the least.   I also wish we'd stop the dewy-eyed moralising about democracy. As we used to know—and as the descendants of Weimar certainly know—stability is more important, and public opinion can be moulded far too easily to be allowed much of a say in foreign policymaking. Sensible countries know this (I'm personally appalled that the pandering to domestic opportunists in the UK has led to an in–out EU referendum—a topic beyond 90% of the population's comprehension). Nevertheless, the whinging about the strong trampling the voice of the people (cynically masqueraded by the not-so-strong) will continue; I only hope that the people, having entered willingly or not into this bargaining game, will accept responsibility for the outcome, however catastrophic that might be."

The economic aspects are certainly beyond the grasp of most people so their opinion on the referendum isn't worth the paper the ballot is printed on.

I think that's certainly the rhetoric that provoked the referendum, and it's certainly what most people voting against membership will be voting on. I think it'll also make them quite intransigent, given that they either don't know or don't care about all other aspects of EU membership, many of which I'd argue are good (and certainly cause to stay in the EU). On an aside, while I still expect Brexit to be avoided, this Greece crisis is going to be an interesting dynamic in (what little substantial) debate, since even the traditionally staunch Europhiles of the left are increasingly re-assessing their position."

Do American authors and politicians really think the EU can solve these problems by throwing yet more money at them?  Greece already owes them over €320 billion.    Successful reforms start with the acknowledgment that there are deficiencies that need to be remedied.  Unfortunately, there have been depressingly few signs that Greece is willing to reform its political system and bureaucracy, however glaring their shortcomings.    Instead, there have been collective denials of reality, like the parliamentary committee that declared all the Greek public debt as illegal, illegitimate, and onerous. Perhaps that was a fall-back position, after the €350 billion reparations from Germany didn't pan out?ll    And what exactly was that referendum about?  The proposals mentioned on the ballot were obsolete. The SYRIZA government had a perfectly valid mandate from its election last December. Beyond the venting of national sentiment, all it did was waste time. The financial situation is now worse than before, which hardly improves Greece's bargaining position.

They even hosted the Olympics in 2004.   Some degree of contraction was inevitable after that binge.   Also, who should have financed that stimulus? The usual creditor states of the Eurozone, like France and Germany, were already exposed to many billions of Greek debt. The consensus was, and is, that Greece needed reforms more than it needed cheap money.   After all, the cheap money from 2000 to 2008 had not been used productively."

Unless confidence is restored, the same may happen with stimulus money.    The reforms insisted on by the creditors seems to be choking any hope of a recovered Greece,   Reforms are needed, as far as bureaucratic bloat, corruption, tax avoidance, political patronage, and the large informal sector are concerned. That was not achieved to a meaningful degree.   Lowering pensions instead of fighting pension fraud, or dismissing civil servants and public employees by their thousands, instead of making sure they do  useful work, was the wrong approach.  Problem is that there are few signs of SYRIZA doing things differently that its predecessors. There seems to be no willingness to reform anything, beyond paying lip service and creating yet more bureaucratic bodies.   E.g., prime minister Tsipras didn't shrink from appointing his cousin to a top level post in the ministry of foreign affairs, as the secretary general of Greek international economic relations.

[It forces] each member country to comply with its agenda. If the US long term policy is to crush Russia and Iran then Nato has to dance to the tune.   This, however, is where you betray how much you know on the subject. As you said yourself, almost nobody actually fulfils their defence spending requirements, and if you'd studied the organisation you might know something about its internal politics too. For example, when the US and some Eastern European states were calling to give Georgia and Ukraine Membership Action Plans in 2008, it was fierce disagreement from Western European states that denied them this. Similarly, it was NATO states which were vehemently against the erroneous war in Iraq in 2003, and today it is NATO states (Western Europeans mostly) which field the gentlest responses to Russia's war in Ukraine, and who have the most doubts about Iran's (potentially) malicious intent.

Their business relations with Germany would mean that they could trade favours for supporting each other within the structure of the BRICS. Not sure it's in Germany's interest to leave their current situation though. They've benefitted greatly from trade with the USA, and the rest of the Eurozone.

Indeed, the banks that lent the money knew perfectly well the condition Greece was in. The idea that the Greeks pulled the wool over the bankers' eyes is nonsense. The bankers wanted to make the loans because they made money off of transactions. Plus, European institutions that bought the loans from them bailed out those that made the loans. The people who made the loans sold them to third parties, and the third parties sold them to EU institutions.     This is what people need to be aware of more than anything else because it shows how incestuously greedy the system is in Europe and the US.

Countries don't engage in total wars anymore and they are unlikely to do so in the future because the game has changed.

Also the ttp and ttip are agreements that are designed to keep the Chinese from becoming a dominant trading power.   That is true, but as I understood it these agreements, at the same time, give more power to companies at the cost of the (western) governments their influence. And (western) companies have no color, know no loyalty towards the West or its civilians.

The rate of production is abysmal for either engine.   The Chinese have a weak grasp of avionics as well, with almost all the avionics packages closely resembling the late-90s Russian hardware, the radar in their new fighters are production copies of early-90s Russian radars.

His assertion that it's foolish to look at Islamic terror without considering American / NATO / whatever operations in the Middle East is correct.  But he lies the blame for Islamic terrorism squarely at the feet of Western society, when in fact religious terrorism, in some form or another, has been alive and well since humans first started believing in higher powers.  As to your point, yes, Iraq and Afghanistan were not justified wars.  But just because the Saudi monarchy couldn't keep their own spoiled-ass princes from funding jihadists doesn't mean they necessarily deserved death any more than Iraq did. Sending the US Army to topple the custodians of Mecca and Medina would have been stupidity beyond even what Bush and Blair could concoct.

But it was a ploy  and a  tactical maneuver designed to speed up border negotiations with the USSR.   The propaganda said one thing, but in actual fact China never raised the question of reclaiming Siberia or Russia’s Far East in laborious border talks with the Soviet Union. The Chinese authorities understood that such claims were delusive.   Mao Zedong soon contradicted himself by asserting:   “I never said that more than a million square kilometers must be returned to China. I only said that this was something that happened. There were unfair treaties that China was forced to accept.”  Of course even with the normalization of relations between Moscow and Beijing, it was impossible to ignore this sore subject.  But that is the thing  Deng Xiaoping’s call on May 16, 1989 to “close the past” in Sino-Soviet relations alluded, among other matters, to territorial claims. He let his Soviet counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev know that bygones could be bygones, and that the USSR and China could put these problems behind them.   And lets not forget that starting from Jiang Zemin, each new Chinese leader has emphasized that the question of the Russian-Chinese border is officially closed, and there is no reason to doubt that they are sincere.  Those entire articles are absurd , Mongolia is a country next to China rich with natural ressources and formally part of China but yet you never saw an article saying that China will annex them but of course they will take on Russia..

West Papua has been fighting for independence ever since. It is the scene of the worst ongoing genocide. A million Indonesian migrants - mostly Islamic malays from Java - were shipped in over the last 50 years so the native population are outnumbered in their own land. That policy is called Transmigrassi.   The native population are melanesian christians and animists - they have nothing in common with Indonesians - not ethnically, not culturally, not linguistically, not religiously. They hate each other.  The Indonesians call the West Papuans savages and primitives and continual killings, beatings and torture are a hallmark of the brutal occupation.  Nobel peace prize nominee Filep Karma is still in jail for raising the morningstar flag. You get 15 years in an Indonesian prison for raising that West Papuan morningstar flag. It looks a bit like the cuban flag - white star on a red strip with blue and white stripes.  Deadly in Indonesia.  But the tide is turning.

Defend Assad all you want but he has failed in his role as protector of the rights of Syrian citizens and the numbers don't lie.

Never in the history of military rule has it been easier then ever to prop up a man who is as incompetent like Assad. I will not criticize Russia any more , but nuclear bullying has made Assad arrogant and he feels untouchable by outside forces . Iran and Hezbollah have saved Damascus and their justification has been to  protect any Shia brother in the Levant . Russia saved Assad with the chemical weapon deal, a noble action when analyzed in relations to US military policy, and Assad did not change his behavior one bit and felt more invincible and more chaos has occurred .  Assad is responsible for all deaths in Syria and all activities (ISIS) in Syria.  He is responsible for the militant groups he aids and sends missiles to outside his borders who have been the reason for many civilian deaths and years of psychological terrorism against highly productive citizens . Assad takes no responsibility , never has, and this is the flawed mentality that has led to corruption in Syria and to the failure of the state .Assad is a great media manipulator and is good at blaming everyone else for the fall of Syria when the real issues Re basic economics and structural corruption.

They would play a major role and would be cooperating with real governments who aim to protect their rights . A large reason the State of Order in Syria doesn't exist is because the Assad family for 45 years have implemented backwards economic policies . New and better policies can and will be imemented and likely the refugees will live in a society that actually gives them real economic rights . The Syrian people are good and those who have survived the genocide by the Assad family will have better opportunities .  There are many policies to be implemented and I will start with a few : open currency , poultry and livestock production , a government structure where corruption isn't embedded at all levels , and a society structure that allows for technology development by any human of any class or race or religion .  All countries in the region will benefit from ignoring Assads barbaric ways. New trade routes that bypass Damascus and go through Lebanon and Northern Syria / Turkey to new ports .  Any military position held by Assad outside of Damascus is being held because of intense bunkering with higher quality weaponry . Rebuild around this and call for a transition in the monopoly over the SAA held by Assad. If refused ,the SAA will continue to bunker and be ignored , or, they will leave their bunkering and be defeated in open combat as they have in every other region . Sanction any government or group supplying oil and energy resources to the SAA. Make sure any parilamilitary group in Damacus is only there to protect Shia or other religious minorities (because Assad doesn't do this).  Anyone who says it will take 30-100 years to rebuild Syria doesn't understand good economic policy .  The President before the barbaric Assad in 1970 was very good to Assad and treated him like a son and his economic policies were better for the Syrian people . Assad abused his position in the force and overthrew this man and put him jail until the end . The dictatorship masked as a Presidency continued for 45 years and this area of the region , at the crossroads of civilization and globalization with tremendous potential, has been unstable and not sustainable due to this family .  Current Assad has had chance to reform and he has received good proposals to leave his position unlike what his family has done to other humans who have not committed any genocide. This is all for their family's ego and selfish ideological  interest. If Assad continues to make bad decisions and is thrown in jail for the rest of his life then this is something he deserved a long time ago. If Damascus ends up  burning then I promise you it won't be difficult to rebuild and start from scratch . In this case the priority should be to protect the Shia offshoot minorities and inform them Assad is not a real defender of their faith ."

It appears that the majority of Syrians don't want Assad, but it looks like there's far from a consensus on what a government in the region would look like. Popular vote would probably yield a Sunni state, which Hizbollah, Iran, and their allies would work to undermine - probably a situation similar to Iraq after Saddam was toppled. And who is willing to invest so much in Syria?"
geopolitics,3c72jt,Ottomatix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"It really would depend on the individuals in the room . With that being said who decides the individuals in the room ?  I would say one group would be comprised of the individuals who are able to remove Assad. If Russia plays their role in a transition then this will give them rights . If the coalition needs to take it a step further then this coalition would have the same rights .  Another set of groups would represent the commanders / leaders of the various rebel groups who represent a certain territory. The conversation with these groups depend on their land , power, and proposals for governing . Do they want to attempt self govern of the land? If so then until an evolution in the new Syrian government or forever ? It all depends on their ability to do this and their proposals to do this .  I think Sunni and Shia should cooperate around certain institutions mainly finance and future oil standards . It is difficult to expect Sunni and Shia to be friends as a result of Assad being removed but there are certain institutions (bank, ""council / parliament "" where severe issues can be confronted with dialogue ) and very basic agreements (very basic religious cease fires in Syria , basic oil agreements to prevent a disaster in the global market , agreements around Shrines ). We can't expect a peace treaty but understandings that allow for stepping blocks for cooperation.  Bordering nations should have a minor role since they are affected by trade and refugees and travel.  My opinion would be to restrict the SAA and a temporary Balkanization of Syria . These areas will either be independent fully or a part of a federalized Syria or eventually cities again under the State of Syria . A temporary Balkanization allows for cease fires to begin and for life for those in the areas to begin their steps towards recovery and stability . The conversation will build from here and the decisions of those involved will impact how this evolves .  The Assad monopoly over the SAA needs to end . Any troops outside of Damascus need to be recalled . The exceptions being in bases where no fighting exists and the threat of rogue actions are little to none . It is foolish to call all troops back, for example the ones on the front lines fighting ISIS. A cease fire would exist under the notion that if SAA leaves then there may be civilian death and so the SAA will only leave when the coalition agrees the area is secure from this. The role of the SAA should evolve to being placed only in current strongpoints in Damascus and restrictions on certain use of force (Air Force should be restricted ). If Syria remains Balkanized then the SAA will be on permanent restrictions and its future would be based on practicality. In areas where the SAA is bunkered down with no prospect for developing the area for the benefit of the citizens then they should be recalled : South, Kurds, certain parts of North.  Maybe an international body that is beneath the UN but used the purpose of Middle East Stabiity . So the major players of the region would have involvement , like UN Security Council (U.S.,Russia , China ) and its next members include members in the region . Any stakeholders around the region or outside would have basic participation . Focus on development and preventing anymore civilian deaths .  These are just ideas . Send back if any make no sense and I am thinking of this as I write . Many ways to solve .  Who is willing to invest ? If market conditions are stable and open then this is a  problem the world should hope to encounter . Anyone in finance , food, oil, and telecoms would benefit greatly and Europe ME Asia would benefit most. I think this would lead to the better development in Africa the world has predicted ."

My point is China is desperate for resources and money   China has a habit of buying resources from across the world with their money. They are not that desperate. Read the article I cited on the how significant the undersea deposits are (not very).   China in theory could blockade Taiwan into rejoining the mainland if the US withdrew.

I guess you could consider Operation Sharp Guard during the mid 90s, but there really isn't much of a record outside of a world war and the prevention of nuclear missiles being stationed off the coast of Florida. In other words, the only times the U.S. has ever resorted to a blockade was in situations where its domestic security was directly threatened, which would not at all be the case for any potential blockade of the Strait of Malacca. Unimpeded flow of trade has been a major component of U.S. global strategy for the past decade and recent history does not support the assertion that the U.S. would blockade trade to China when the fact is that they never blockaded trade to the USSR throughout the entire Cold War. Granted, the USSR was not nearly as dependent on sea trade."
geopolitics,3c74ja,Rice_22,5,Mon Jul 6 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"My post has simply established the fact that the US can ""in theory"" (borrowing /u/00000000000000000000's phrase in our discussion of the hypothetical), enforce a naval blockade at the least cost to itself of all players involved.   The last U.S. naval blockade was against Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis for a single month and was not even a full blockade   You are incorrect. Since the Cuban blockade in 1962, the US have engaged in blockades against North Vietnam during the Vietnam War (1965-1975) and the US-led maritime enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq (1990-2003).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_blockades#Early-modern_era  So there is plentiful historical precedent of the modern US navy engaging in blockades as part of its economic warfare strategy against geopolitical rivals and upstarts.  Now we move onto motive. You claim that the US supports ""unimpeded flow of trade"" and blockade is only ever employed in the event of directly threatened US domestic security. We see from the aforementioned examples (Vietnam War, War in Iraq) that this was not the case.  With regards to China's critical oil vulnerability, even a partial blockade or a disruption of the Malacca shipping route could lead to economic woes in China. Needless to say that the CCP are preparing themselves against such a hypothetical situation by fortifying their claims. As /u/rwat1 explained, China considers with good reason that in the event of a confrontation between China and US/US allies, the ""freedom of navigation"" of Chinese vessels could very well be threatened."
geopolitics,3c74ja,UpvoteIfYouDare,3,Mon Jul 6 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I missed the blockade of Vietnam. I was even looking at that page to double check my claims.  Vietnam was virtually unconnected to the international economy, meaning that a blockade against the country was intended to block weapons shipments rather than actual trade. Furthermore, the U.S. was already at war with North Vietnam when the blockade was enacted. The blockade was not a preemptive attempt to harm the Vietnamese economy but was rather a component of the overall military strategy in Vietnam. With this context in mind, the blockade of Vietnam did not impede international trade, although it was an instance of a blockade that was not a response to a direct domestic threat.  I wouldn't really count the blockade of Iraq with the others considering it was sanctioned by UN Security Council Resolution 661 and both China and Russia voted in favor.  Regardless, I agree that part of the PLA's intent in fortifying the SCS is to negate any possibility of a blockade of the Strait of Malacca. However, I think another component of this move is to block U.S. surveillance capabilities in the region. An interesting idea I read recently is the possibility that the SCS fortification is meant to allow Chinese submarines to pass undetected into the Pacific and Indian. A well secured SCS would provide China with a strategic exit from the first island chain such that it would be harder to track submarines coming and going than off the shores of Taiwan and Japan.  Overall, though, I think this is a classic example of the security dilemma."

Nevertheless, the option exists and is possible and so China take steps to defend itself.  Your alternate explanation makes sense to me as well. The US have been conducting spy planes and ships right in ""international waters/airspace"" where their range extends into Chinese territory for a while now. China isn't going to take that sitting down, and because they lack the means to do tit-for-tat off the US coast they would instead harass towing sonar ships and setting up their own ADIZs.  It was always inevitable that China would want to safeguard its own security within its ""sphere of influence"". Due to the unequal size difference between China and SEA countries, the security dilemma you claim exists wouldn't be able to sustain itself for long (unlike Britain and Germany pre-WWI).

Anyway, if you want to actually get a real answer to ""a question that has been nagging since the fall of the World Trade Center: Why do they hate us?"" then you should hear it straight from the horses mouth. Below are excerpts from Osama bin Laden's letter to America after 9/11.   Why are we fighting and opposing you? The answer is very simple: Because you attacked us and continue to attack us. You attacked us in Palestine: Palestine, which has sunk under military occupation for more than 80 years. The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation. The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals.  You steal our wealth and oil at paltry prices because of you international influence and military threats.  Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases throughout them  You have starved the Muslims of Iraq, where children die every day. It is a wonder that more than 1.5 million Iraqi children have died as a result of your sanctions, and you did not show concern. Yet when 3000 of your people died, the entire world rises and has not yet sat down.  These tragedies and calamities are only a few examples of your oppression and aggression against us. It is commanded by our religion and intellect that the oppressed have a right to return the aggression. Do not await anything from us but Jihad, resistance and revenge. Is it in any way rational to expect that after America has attacked us for more than half a century, that we will then leave her to live in security and peace?!!  You may then dispute that all the above does not justify aggression against civilians, for crimes they did not commit and offenses in which they did not partake. This argument contradicts your continuous repetition that America is the land of freedom, and its leaders in this world. Therefore, the American people are the ones who choose their government by way of their own free will; a choice which stems from their agreement to its policies. Thus the American people have chosen, consented to, and affirmed their support for the Israeli oppression of the Palestinians, the occupation and usurpation of their land, and its continuous killing, torture, punishment and expulsion of the Palestinians. The American people have the ability and choice to refuse the policies of their Government and even to change it if they want."

Phrases like the ""radical Greek government"" are not parts of the lexicon of rational debate.  Even the article admits that no economist worth his salt views the IMF/Eurozone deal as a sustainable path to a solvent Greece. The austerity conditions required by the deal have already led to the highest unemployment rate in the First World, and their continued enforcement only serves to send Greece further into the economic death spiral of the last several years - and that's completely ignoring the troubling fact that the EU has apparently offered a deal so bad that it either forces a change in the Greek government or a disorderly exit from the Eurozone. Such is not the action of an organization committed to reasonable democracy.   Tsipras might be a zealot, but Merkel and her allies are no better. At least Tsipras is making the empirically correct decision by rejecting a deal that cannot possibly solve the problem at hand."
geopolitics,3c3noz,Malaveylo,13,Sat Jul 4 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"I recommend the Stratfor article on the current showdown for those who may have missed it earlier in the week. In brief: the primary European motivation is to frighten other Eurozone powers out of their own exits from the Eurozone, and this is served by maximizing both the damage and the perceived radicalness of Syriza.  In this regard (to add my own analysis) Merkel's leadership has been ideal, serving to cement to the German media (and others) that her error was in not being harsh enough. It is a very successful move on her part given the objectives that her party has going in to the negotiation.  At the same time, Tsipras' strategy has been more personal. If the referendum he suggested succeeds in rejecting the German offer, he can leave the Eurozone without being accused of doing so unilaterally, beginning a promising career of leadership where he can claim credit for any gains and blame Germany for any problems. If it fails, he can step down and become leader of the opposition, again blaming the Germans for anything that goes wrong and gaining support for another run."

The article says that austerity alone is not working, but the loss of jobs can also be attributed to a lack of investment and confidence, which will not improve by reneging on agreements. They campaigned on anti austerity but obviously didn't have a clear financial plan of what to do instead. Now instead of losing face at home, the referendum is a tool to take responsibility for whatever happens away from his government. It is moot as there has already been a default and rejection of terms. There was insufficient time for proper debate of what is quite a complex issue. If anything, the article is more critical of Merkel, than tsipras, seeing as it is a German paper. There is no easy solution for Greece, but no one seems willing to make the tough decisions which will be unpopular. In the end, the entire country suffers."

geopolitics,3c0oc6,furyfairy,26,Fri Jul 3 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"In the short-term, ISIS is probably a net-benefit to Israel. The primary threats to Israel over the past decade have been: (1) Hamas, (2) Hezbollah in Lebanon, (3) Iran, and (4) Syria. ISIS are a Sunni extremist organisation. Their major power-bases are in Iraq and Syria. As a result, Iran has been forced to direct more of its resources to preserving its allies and sattelites which are threatened by ISIS. Hezbollah fighters are reportedly fighting for the regime in Syria, the Syrian military is in shambles and its efforts are directed inwards, against rebel groups, rather than potentially against Israel. It is also likely that supply routes from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon are somewhat disrupted by the instability and loss of territorial control of the government in Syria. In other words, ISIS has Israel's strategic threats occupied, which leaves Israel in a relatively secure position.  In the medium to long term, the answer is much less clear. It depends largely on how organised, sophisticated and entrenched ISIS will become. Will they be able to coordinate their activity across all their different ""provinces"" (sub-groups) across the region? Can they formulate a coherent strategic vision and, in a coordinated fashion, apply it? It's too early to say for now. I would remind you all that the Mujahideen/Taliban were also of short-term strategic benefit to the United States. We all know how that turned out. As I see it, the danger for Israel is that, in furtherance of their ambition to create an Islamic state across the Middle East, ISIS will in fact direct attacks against Israel. The purpose of such attacks would not be to conquer Israel, just as Hezbollah attacks are not meant to conquer Israel. There is little that the Arab world can agree on more uniformally than their dislike of Israel, and the Arab street has always stood behind those leaders who have been seen to be tough and willing to stand up to it. This has been a repeating historic trend. Nasser in Egypt was the peak of this kind of thinking, but we see it in the Palestinian Territories with Hamas, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon as well. Typically, after any military conflict with Israel, their popularity with the common people in the region increases substantially. The same would be a viable strategy for ISIS to gather popular support, in my opinion. If they can be coordinated, and attack Israel on multiple fronts (e.g. from Sinai, the Gaza Strip, and Syria) they would become a far more significant strategic threat than anything Israel faces presently.  I don't believe for a moment that Israel is offering active support to ISIS. The field hospital in the Golan Heights treats all kinds of Syrians, whatever faction they belong to. If Israel is in fact offering ISIS any kind of covert support, it is incredibly short-sighted of them."

I imagine if ISIS gets too close, the Israelis will adopt a 'prune them back' strategy.  ISIS is more interested in fighting Shia and Iran/Asssd than it is Israel.  Israel can capitalize on that by doing substantially nothing but watch their enemies burn."
geopolitics,3c0oc6,joerobo,10,Fri Jul 3 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. Also ISIS is territorially based. Their claim to fame is building a caliphate, an Islamic State.

(No part of ISIS territory borders Israel) This puts them at odds mostly with the Shia forces of Iran & Iraq as well as the Alawite army of Syria.

Western powers will take care of them long before they take the power. Really, the reason why they are still here comes from a lack of political will to invade Iraq and Syria: they are legitimate countries, the International System doesn't held the same opinions about the matter (where a direct invasion wouldn't be positive for the US or Europe). As soon as Damasco or Baghdad are taken, the world will start to attack ISIS, for it would become a real treat both for the West and their allies.  Now, supposing ISIS starts doing terrorist acts on Israel, I bet Netanyahu will jump on his bed. Fairly a great event for Israel politics, of course not for its population. He will now have a reason to attack his boundaries, to militarise its frontiers with everything the country has to offer. We must bear in mind that Israel is way more aggressive than any country who would do something against ISIS. Thus this group won't, or at least, shouldn't mess with Israel, not until they have enough power to hold a chance of not being annihilated.

Russia never violated anything you need to understand the definition of maritime boundary.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_boundary  Russia was never in the territorial waters of the baltic states but in their economic maritime zone. This is perfectly legal to use military ships in maritime economic zone of any countries  See UNCLOS(United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea )   UNCLOS attempts to balance the differing interests of coastal and maritime states, but is silent or ambiguous on the legality of military operations in foreign EEZs. It will be difficult to look for an authoritative legal interpretation regarding military activities in the EEZ if such a dispute is not presented before the ICJ or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.95.

geopolitics,3bvvns,iamthegodemperor,35,Thu Jul 2 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"By ROBERT D. KAPLAN Updated June 30, 2015 7:40 p.m. ET 240 COMMENTS Geopolitics can be more important than economics. Just look at Greece. On purely economic grounds, Greece should never have been admitted to the European Union in 1981 and might have been ejected from the eurozone months ago.  But what many European policy makers know—even if few articulate it—is that Europe will be increasingly vulnerable to Russian aggression if its links to Greece are substantially loosened. Greece is the only part of the Balkans accessible on several seaboards to the Mediterranean, and thus is a crucial gateway to and from the West.  Opinion Journal Video Center for a New American Security Senior Fellow Robert Kaplan on the geopolitics behind Greece’s economic woes. Photo credit: Getty Images. Given the bellicosity of Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is useful to contemplate what would have happened had Stalin not ceded Greece to the West in return for the rest of the Balkans at the start of the Cold War. With Greece inside the Communist bloc, Italy would have been permanently endangered, to say nothing of the whole eastern Mediterranean and the Levant. Indeed, American bases in Greece were critical to the policy of containment.  But Greece, in terms of its politics and culture, is not fully anchored in the West. Greece is more properly viewed as the child of Byzantine and Ottoman despotism than of Periclean Athens. The mid-19th century revolutions in Europe were often of bourgeois origins with political liberties as their goal. Yet the Greek independence movement was more of an ethnic movement with a religious basis. Greece, by virtue of its Eastern Orthodox Christianity, has an emotional and spiritual bond with Russia. This helps explain why most Greeks sided with Russia in favor of the Serbs and against Europe during the 1999 Kosovo War, even if the Greek government’s position was more equivocal.  Greece never had modern political parties to the degree of Central and Western Europe. Greek parties have been largely paternalistic, coffeehouse fiefs organized around charismatic individuals, featuring a reactionary-style right-wing movement and a radical-style left-wing movement. Andreas Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister for much of the 1980s and ’90s, was never a modern European socialist, as many in the West in the 1980s believed. Rather, as I know from living in Athens during that decade, he is better understood as a Latin-American style populist in the tradition of Juan Perón.  Papandreou is one forerunner to the current Greek disaster, a cynical politician, who, rather than use aid from Brussels to create a more streamlined polity after Greece joined the EU, enlarged the bureaucracy and created an impossible-to-sustain welfare state. Greece today is a badly institutionalized country where too few pay taxes as they should, further burdened by a bloated bureaucracy. Most Greek businesses are family owned, and meritocracy is in short supply. The Greek political culture is not wholly Western, so why should the economy be?  The newspaper with the largest circulation and influence in Greece during the Papandreou era was the left-wing Ethnos (the Nation), which had suspected links to the Soviet intelligence services. The Soviets found it easier to operate in Greece than perhaps in any other NATO country. Greece during the Cold War was never comfortable inside NATO, and instead yearned for a dreamy, nebulous neutrality. NATO and the EU kept Greece free and prosperous, unlike the other states of the Balkans, but Greeks, having never experienced life inside the Warsaw Pact, were never grateful for being kept out of it.  All this is prologue to the rise of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his hard-left Syriza party. Because modern conservatism and modern socialism only arrived in Greece toward the end of the 20th century, they were quickly swept aside for the hard left and fascist right (the Golden Dawn party) once the economy imploded in recent years. Given the Kremlin’s long-standing relationships in Greece, it is conceivable that the Russians now have better ties with—and intelligence on—Syriza and its various factions than the Europeans do.  Russia may be helping to inflame Syriza’s internal divisions in the hope that Greece’s ruling party cannot make the difficult concessions necessary to stay in the eurozone. If Greece does leave the eurozone, the economic aftershocks to the domestic economy could reduce it to a semi-failed state that, along with the dismemberment and weakening of Ukraine, will seriously weaken Europe’s geopolitical position vis-à-vis Russia.  If this happens not only will the Iberian states of Spain and Portugal be more susceptible to euro-debt contagion, but Balkan states with weak institutions and fragile economies like Albania, Bulgaria and Romania will be in a more exposed position. While those states were never part of the eurozone, the spectacle of a major Balkan country pivotally loosening its ties with the West, even as Russia appears momentarily ascendant in the region, will be sobering in the extreme.  Then there is the larger picture. The first post-Cold War decades featured a secure Eurasian maritime sphere from the Mediterranean across the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific. Thus, the weakening of Greece’s ties with the West in the eastern Mediterranean has to be seen alongside the ascendancy of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the rise of China in the South and East China seas as a singular process in the chipping away at American power.  The EU, as frustrating as its policies can be, represents the ultimate triumph of American power emerging from the bloodshed of World War II. If Greece does leave the eurozone, whatever the country’s sins, it is demonstrably in Europe’s and America’s interest to nurse it back to health to keep, for example, Russian warships away from Greek ports. Greece, whether with the euro or the drachma, is in need of nation-building. Europe, after all, to be true to its own values, must give hope and succor to its periphery.  Mr. Kaplan is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. He is the author of “In Europe’s Shadow: Two Cold Wars and a Thirty Year Journey Through Romania and Beyond,” to be published in next February."

geopolitics,3bvvns,deuxglass1,7,Thu Jul 2 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"Wait I don't think you mean leave the EU. The Eurozone, perhaps?  Anyway, I still think it is unlikely that Greece will leave. If the issue was just having Euro denominated debts that it is unable to pay, it would be easiest if Greece left the currency union, let its new currency plummet and begin anew. But the issue is political too. As punishing as Germany seems to be, it really doesn't want Greece to go, since that will if nothing else, register as a huge symbolic blow to the European project. Part of the reason for this never ending crises is that it is difficult for the elected leaders to make the entirely unpopular and in some sense, unfathomable proposals to their people.   For example: Can you imagine citizens in Massachusetts complaining about subsidizing the state of Alabama? Could the American currency union work if wealthy states actively did complain and forced other states to enact measures that actually cut their own economic growth? Of course not, a 25% decrease in Alabama's GDP would offset the 1% gain in Massachusetts GDP, to the detriment of the United States.  Greece has many issues: with tax collection, with its propensity to lie and its tardiness reforming its social-welfare state. But even in a perfect world it could not abide by all the austerity requirements and have money to pay its debt. But this isn't something that can be explained to the German public...(or probably any public). Likewise, who could explain to Greeks that as terrible as things are now, they should comply with tax collectors so that in the future, they might get a better deal from Germany et al.?   There is still a bit of theatre going on. The referendum seems to work as a face-saving measure for Tsipras (and maybe in the long-term for Merkel) as well as a way to punt the issue a little while longer. Even a ""NO"" vote would not necessarily lead to a Grexit. This is because more negotiations follow the referendum regardless. Between all these negotiations, some kind of obfuscating language has to be created that preserves Germany's aggressive posture, while actually reducing the debt burden to let the Greek economy grow again.  From the perspective of Greece itself: it is a small economy, essentially isolated without access to the Eurozone.  EDIT: have you read the referendum? It's purposefully confusing!"

There's a fair point in that the United States has a substantial advantage due to its geography that many countries do not.  Its breadbasket status somewhat mitigates the immediate risk of climate change, in that it could always produce more food and export less.  It is also still brain-draining many countries, providing relative advantage in developing new technologies (assuming it invests in this direction, which it should).  While some regions' water supplies are being used unsustainably, the possibility exists to transport water from aquifer to the other for irrigation or to desalinate seawater, depending on which is more economical.  He places heavy emphasis on our use of waterways as making our freight transport more efficient, which is flat out wrong.  One of America's greatest accomplishments is its rail system, which transports 39.5% of its freight, followed by trucks at 28.6%.  Sea is the second least used, at roughly 12%. Only air moves less, at under 1%.  He also doesn't really address that other countries are challenging American institutional dominance.

geopolitics,3bw9zs,Pielille,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm...it's kinda reasonable. It's closer and in recent years Mexico itself has had some unrest as a result. It isn't a sexy topic like Chinese cyber-warfare and gets less media attention. So it's good he brings it up. And it's in a sense a bigger priority. Ultimately though, this isn't something I see spilling violently across the US, if cross-border relations remain close and more security cooperation is increased.  Moreover, if Mexico really is going to be a huge source of economic growth, we would expect that the Mexican government would have more ability to deal with cartels and as well as pressure for more joint security work with the US to increase.  Going back to the more marginal case of Chinese cyber-attacks, these do have the potential to have a more devastating impact on US security, because they are asymmetric. A country with more limitations (geographic, military, economic) could force a far more powerful country to take proportionally far more costly defense measures.   For China, which has substantially less access to the seas and is surrounded by suspicious or quasi-hostile states, cyber-attacks could be an easy way to surmount these geographic barriers. While a devastating attack like the Office of Personnel Management doesn't result in loss of life etc. it does threaten millions of Americans to identity theft and in high profile cases coercion etc. It also represents an ability to capture critical information from the US. Imagine if hacks to disable satellites or advanced weapons systems became possible? China would not need to do this on a daily basis to weaken the US position. Only to be able to threaten to do so if certain red-lines were crossed etc. A low grade version of this has already occurred with multinational corporations, which have often lost either intellectual property and/or been coerced into violating certain principles operating in the Chinese market (releasing emails of nonviolent protesters).   Note: I have no animus towards the PRC/China etc. I just want to note that they have a great incentive to beef up their cyber-warfare because of their geography."

Germany is heavily invested in the EU as a project, is one of the primary benefactors of it and so maintaining it as a strong institution is Germany's #1 strategic goal. If Russia threatens that, Germany will definitely have a reason to oppose them, with our without the US. And they can do it, without the US (but not alone), Russia isn't what it used to be back in it's union days. Why Germany would ""combine"" with Russia just because of a US departure is lost on me, the reason the US is opposed to Russian actions is also the same reason why Germany is, allowing Russia to stretch it's imperial ambition tendrils west is not in Europe's best interest."

I think we can accept the Russia wants to exert control of the ""Near Abroad"" or sabotage attempts of the periphery to join the European markets, without believing that Germany is going to be bogged down by it.   Ukraine, for example: is a buffer country and (Crimea aside) is being quasi invaded by irregular soldiers. Putin launched the attacks to shore up his domestic support and to prevent Ukraine from entering deeper trade agreements with the EU.  Where else could Russia attack (in Europe)? It has already done something similar in faraway Georgia. And maybe if Belarus collapses it could step in there. But otherwise, it is surrounded by EU/NATO countries. The exception is Moldova, but that country has entered into a lot of security & trade agreements with the EU. It is ethnically identical to EU member Romania. But it is relatively poorer and has some issues, a breakaway province that borders Ukraine, notably. Still, it is difficult to see any Russian inspired conflict there getting too out of control."

So Putin won't provide financial assistance out of fear of Western retaliation, but he'll annex Crimea and start a civil war?

As for your kicker, other than Syria, which they are not directly involved and which has one of the only Russian navel bases outside of Russia and is a main buyer of Russian military goods; Russia has only been involved with areas of the world ( its borders) which ""DO have a bearing on its direct security concerns""  e.i. border country's that want to go NATO.   You realize that by keeping those small areas under rebel control (5-10% of the country) those ex-Soveit country's can not join NATO because NATO bylaws say to join NATO there can not be current disputes right? That's why there is no full invasions, Russia dosent really want it, they just want to make sure NATO isnt on their border. Just like the U.S. couldn't stand Cuba being communist ( many props to Obama for taking Cuba out of future Russian influence with the normalization of relations).   Crimea is a bit different. It certainly WAS Russian for most of the last 200 years and it IS mostly Russian people's living there now but its takeover was mostly because of the 100 billion dollars in navel bases Russia may have strait lost or had to share with NATO in a decade or so had Ukraine decided to. Its takeover not only keep that from ever happening but also reduced Ukraine's future navel power significantly at the same time if they ever do get into NATO one day.  It was/is irreplaceable to both Russia and Ukraine. It's a kill three birds with one stone move that from a strait military/security perspective is about as good a move as one ever gets and it was basically bloodless and over in a week.

You asked who is was and stated he had zero credibility but your arguments are based off things he never said ( territorial boundaries) or he got right (direct sphere of influence and not interfering in areas of the world that are not in their sphere).    Indeed, unlike the US and other Western powers, Russia knows and respects geopolitical boundaries.   If you want to try and add to the discussion and not just make up ad hominem attacks on the author, I disagree that Russia would never back Greece. Russia has made it clear by those extraterritorial actions they consider country's that border them their sphere of influence and they are willing, at the very least, to start and maintain small wars to keep NATO away.   We also know they are willing to put up with at least this level of sanctions and presumably more with increasing counter sanctions without backing down. In fact they are actively preparing to withstand worse sanctions by diversifying their energy exports away from Europe and starting their own international banking/lending system in BRICS and card payment system not reliant on the west. Prepping for the things that hurt Iran.   If western Ukraine sanctions and/or NATO encroachments are significantly increased, Russia propping up and fully allying with Greece could be a Russian counter-sanction type reaction ( if Greece voters went for it) in the future. It's not something that would happen now but in a few years of increasing Ukraine tensions and Greece feeling they have nothing to lose after the E.U. finishes with them and the country goes into even worse financial then political chaos."

This predates Putins emergence as President and the establishment of the ruling order in Russia, and hence Russias current foreign policy approach. These conflicts are better understood as a cause of Russia's poor relationship with Georgia and Moldova than a symptom of poor relationships.  It's important to note than neither the Moldovan or Georgian governments have engaged in meaningful negotiations to resolve the disputes and Russias involvement was supported in the West during the early nineties as key to ending the violence.  I don't disagree that Russia's current policy is to maintain these conflicts in order to prevent the expansion of NATO and to dissuade the expansion of the EU.  I agree with the view that within Russia's 'spheres of influence' concept it wouldbe internally logically consistent for Russia to respect pre-existing spheres of influence, but that is going to be more a question of extent than a golden rule of complete noninterference. Russia is happily courting both Egypt and Pakistan, both US Major Non-NATO Allies, and to a lesser extent Turkey in order to build it's Turkish Stream pipeline (It's still unclear if that will ever go ahead).

Given his obvious sympathy for Russia, I wonder why the author shouldn't welcome a Greek-Russian axis?  As for his assertion that ""fears of a Russia-Greece axis are groundless,"" this rests entirely on the author's claims that:   The current Greek prime minister is an atheist and would therefore not be interested in closer ties with another Orthodox country.   Because contrasting religious views have always stopped countries working together in the past…    Russia doesn't have the money to bail out Greece.   But that's not what fears of closer Greek-Russian relations are about. It's not about Russia bailing out Greece. It's about Russia winning influence in Greece, using its monopoly on the Greek gas market to gain leverage, building the Turkish Stream pipeline, gaining access to the Mediterranean, etc.  This all seems to totally escape the author.  Finally, his claim that the West wants (wants!) to keep Greece ""permanently in a state of dependence"" -- has he ever picked up a German newspaper?

Because contrasting religious views have always stopped countries working together in the past…   One thing is ""working together"", and another very different one is establishing a formal alliance with countries with which the only common factor is religion.

It's about Russia winning influence in Greece, using its monopoly on the Greek gas market to gain leverage, building the Turkish Stream pipeline, gaining access to the Mediterranean, etc.   It doesn't ""escape"" the author. He simply dismisses it because Russia acknowledges that Greece is an integral part of ""the West"" and has no appetite for the shitstorm that would ensue.

Half of Europe is about fed up with Greece and would rather the country went its own way already. Nobody likes the fact that Greece is dependent on the rest of the EU. Rather a lot of people in the rest of the EU hate it.   Public opinion is not the same as policy. If the West was adamant to retain tiny Greece after WWII in its block, it was because of its strategic situation as the gate to Asia from which to control the Eastern Mediterranean. Pireo is the first port of entry of Europe-bound vessels from Asia. Critical pipelines from the Middle East and Central Asia cross it. All those geopolitical reasons remain valid to this day, hence Obama's insistence in keeping Greece in the Euro and the EU.

My guess is the Moldovan economy and past affinity towards the 'good old days'    in addition to that Moldova's economy still relies on the Russian market   Sure, but the same could be said for Ukraine, and public opinion there has swung pretty hard against Russia since the Crimea and Donbass crises began.   Well Moldova has not had a revolution, there is very little in terms of gain for anyone to forment anti-Russian sentiment. And just because it isn't really heard doesn't mean pro-Russian sentiment isn't there, Ukraine has a wartime government that has successfully made it quite dangerous to speak in favor of Russia, Odessa is an example    Moldovans are the typical Gasterbeiters here   Sorry, can you explain that part like I'm 5?  I thought Gasterbeiters were people who migrated to Western Europe, primarily West Germany, for work.  Were there a lot of Moldovans who did that?  Or are you saying that a lot of Moldovans currently go to Russia for work?   Yes we kind of adopted the word from the Germans for the same reason, Moldovans are usually heavily prevalent in labor and construction specifically."

There are two important things to note when looking at this article: 1) This was a local election that happened in the wake of Russia invading their neighbor a civil war next door in Ukraine - a lot can happen in the three years between now and the next parliamentary election; 2)Moldova is extremely poor and corrupt.  Pro-European groups have had control of parliament in Moldova, apparently forming a coalition in 2014, so these local elections aren't as big a deal as the journalist makes it out to be. Moldova is an extremely poor, and corrupt country that is geographically isolated from Europe (hence having closer historic ties with places like Russia and Turkey than Europe proper) so I'd rather wait and see what happens than put any weight in the results of these local democratic elections."

The paper was temporarily closed for four months in 1995.[1] Then it became part of the ""Berezovsky Media Group""  Berezovsky entered the Kremlin's inner circle in 1993 through arranging for the publication of Yeltsin's memoirs and befriended Valentin Yumashev, the President's ghost-writer.[56][57][58]  In January 1996, at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Berezovsky liaised with fellow oligarchs to form an alliance – which later became known as the ""Davos Pact""[59] – to bankroll Boris Yeltsin's campaign in the upcoming presidential elections.[60] On his return to Moscow Berezovsky met and befriended Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter,[58] According to a later profile by The Guardian, ""Berezovsky masterminded the 1996 re-election of Boris Yeltsin... He and his billionaire friends coughed up £140 million for Yeltsin's campaign""  Berezovsky was politically opposed to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, since Putin's election in 2000 and remained a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life.[9] In late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK, which granted him political asylum in 2003.[10] In Russia he was later convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement.   In recent years, Berezovsky conducted business with Neil Bush, the younger brother of the US President George W. Bush."

geopolitics,3bpauh,nordasaur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:33:56 2015 UTC,Well let me clarify what I was actually thinking.  By the word coup I probably more meant regime change or something related.  Basically overthrowing Putin by military conflict in the next year or so would be very terrible and could raise the possibilities of nuclear weapons getting used.  But if we focus on the long term over about 10 to 20 years or so we might want to think about imploding the economy of the Russians and increase support to separatists of the many ethnicities that are oppressed by the Russians after Muscovy invaded and stole their land.
geopolitics,3bpauh,nordasaur,3,Wed Jul 1 21:19:24 2015 UTC,That will almost certainly lead to Russia becoming more authoritarian and nationalistic.

geopolitics,3bmaos,godiebiel,37,Tue Jun 30 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"Great question. Typically, the winners in trade deals are producers who have a comparative advantage. So you might anticipate that Australian farmers do well, while Japanese farmers do not. Of course, within that there is a lot of nuance -- some Japanese niche producers could do very well. Large multinationals will benefit, as will consumers. As a Tokyo-based consumer, I am very much looking forward to a better selection of reasonably priced fruit and vegetables, should Japan actually proceed with meaningful concessions.  A trade deal like the TPP will accelerate trends already underway, specifically a shift in production to lower cost countries. That can certainly hurt labor in certain industries, even as cheaper products benefit consumers.  And yes, with the Doha round of global trade talks in the too hard basket, regional trade deals like the TPP and RCEP look to be the future. The question will be the extent to which they are kept exclusive (e.g. China kept out of the TPP) and linked to balance of power groupings. It is not hard to see in the Asia-Pacific two major blocs, each linked by trade and security arrangements.  Edit: I'll add that I think the TPP is essential for Japan, because I think the competition will encourage long delayed structural reforms, especially in the services sector, and greater productivity, which can help with growth."
geopolitics,3bmaos,godiebiel,9,Tue Jun 30 12:09:06 2015 UTC,thank you so much for the answer. it's awesome to see a non-US-centric view on this matter.
geopolitics,3bmaos,theaether,10,Tue Jun 30 12:18:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for your measured take on TPP. It seems to me that discussions on Reddit about TPP too often seem to portray the issue as a conflict between 'the greedy, snatching Americans' and the 'noble natives who multinationals want to screw over.'   Since you are based in Japan, if I could ask whether you have any sense of where the US-Japan bilateral negotiations really are? I assume passage of TPA must have helped, but given Abe's preoccupation with the security bills in the Diet and the drop in approval ratings, I wonder if there's a risk that Abe may decide not to battle two monsters at once, even if he's touted TPP as a part of his third 'arrow' of Abenomics."
geopolitics,3bmaos,theaether,8,Tue Jun 30 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"To his credit, I think Abe remains quite committed to the TPP. The alliance with the U.S. remains huge for Japan. The TPP is laden with both economic and foreign policy significance for Abe's government.  The drop in his approval ratings won't help at all, although there is little in the way of credible opposition. Japan did get a trade deal (admittedly a very tepid one) done with Australia, a major farm exporter. Moreover, there has been a shift in public perceptions of the farm sector -- many people are getting weary of such a tiny segment having such political sway. The average Japanese farmer is 70. Clearly, there needs to be change.  The toughest part I think is Abe having to take on MPs from his own party, at a time of falling approval ratings as you note. Many of these pols represent rural districts. Countering that is very strong support for the TPP from the powerful business lobby.  It is not a done deal, but I think there is a good chance the necessary concessions will be made."

geopolitics,3bmaos,NEWater,5,Tue Jun 30 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I'd be super interested to hear what your concerns are with the pharma field. It's my understanding that there are villains on both sides of the equation -- pharma giants using disingenuous mechanisms to extend patents by changing delivery mechanisms/changing a single molecule, etc -- but also that they face serious challenges in developing markets without strong IP protection, especially if the governments there are savvy enough to use the vilification of big pharma to their own advantage. India is the example I most often trot out for this -- the government's take on compulsory licensing is disingenuous, and consumers are put at risk of potentially dangerous counterfeit products due to the heavy bias toward domestic producers. I imagine a stronger rule-based system would better help the industry in these countries grow, even if in fits and starts."

Eventually local industries would be competitive with foreign goods.   Let's assume Japan made literally everything cheaper than the U.S, and the exchange rate is 1 Dollar=100 Yen. So naturally everyone buys Japanese goods imported to the US, priced in dollars. The Japanese exporters then want to convert their dollars to Yen in order to buy Japanese goods in Japan, priced in yen. But who wants a dollar, when US goods, priced in dollars, are so expensive? So the exporters start offering more dollars for less yen, until where 50 dollars for a DVD player and 300 Yen for a DVD player are equally expensive."

More precisely, on the effect of the secrecy laws passed in 2013 and whether they prevent you or other news sources to adequately report on Japanese politics or policies (in your opinion). I am assuming that while these laws have 'national security' as their raison d'etre, they would implicitly self-censor reporters from publishing anything that damaged the national image (eg. Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald). Any insight you have would be appreciated."
geopolitics,3bmaos,nordasaur,11,Tue Jun 30 13:27:26 2015 UTC,"Aside from some genteel outreach from the Foreign Ministry communications people, we've been largely left alone by the Japanese authorities, although they are aware of our criticisms of the current government.  Given the Japanese government's dodgy record on transparency, and the ambiguities in the law itself, the secrecy law was disturbing, but we haven't felt constrained by it. I think it would have more import for Japanese publications covering local issues. Japanese journalists, at least in the mainstream press, are already pretty notorious for self-censoring through the kisha (press clubs), it is hard to say how much more cautious they would be. But doubtless it would give would-be whistleblowers real pause.  For us, for now at least, Japan remains one of the disappointingly few countries in the region from which we can report without (much) fear of official retribution."

More generally, what's your opinion of Sino-Australian ties?"
geopolitics,3bmaos,peopleR7_6ths,11,Tue Jun 30 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"A very good example of the relevance of this question is the AIIB. The fact that Australia initially hesitated to join was because of U.S. lobbying, but Australia ultimately did sign on, which perhaps shows the limits of U.S. influence.  Yet in other respects the alliance has been strengthening, with the Marines in Darwin, the F-35 purchase, and the trilateral arrangements with Japan.  Australia's ties with China are driven by economics. Australia owes much of its impressive boom to China, and will very likely owe its next recession to a Chinese economic slowdown. Beyond economics and a sizeable Chinese community in Australia the two countries don't have a great deal in common, which compares with the very close historical and cultural ties Australians feel with the U.S.   Australia will continue to try and have its cake and eat it too -- juggling security ties with the U.S. and economic relations with China. The importance of China as a trading partner will encourage Canberra to be quieter on some issues than it otherwise might. But if push ever came to shove, the U.S. alliance will prevail."
geopolitics,3bmaos,di11deux,12,Tue Jun 30 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"With near constant reporting on every minor event, and unprecedented propaganda flooding every media, my question is how you as a news source separate the nonsense from the real news, and how I as a reader, can separate the real news from the propaganda and fear mongering?  As a secondary question how do you feel the way the news is being reported and consumed is affecting real world events? It is apparent that a lot of moves being made by leading nations have a clear motive to send a message and act purely for the purpose of media, but with the tensions raising between the US and China and between the US and Russia and between the US and Iran, I can't help but feel like to a certain extent some portions of the Media are trying to goad world leaders into conflict."
geopolitics,3bmaos,di11deux,15,Tue Jun 30 12:08:11 2015 UTC,"It is not easy, because one reader's nonsense is often another reader's brilliant insight. Ultimately, as editors we have to use our judgment, based on our experience and understanding. We also follow reader feedback pretty carefully -- if we put up a dud piece, we'll soon hear about it.  As a reader, you do need to consider your source, both writer and publication. Some media outlets are dedicated to reinforcing preexisting beliefs among their readers. Some of these outlets do influence real world events -- the impact of Fox News on the Republican Party is the most obvious example.  For most commercial media outlets, giving readers/viewers what they want to read/see is the overriding concern. Fail to do that, and they go out of business. This is why so many important stories go underreported. The more responsible publications will try and strike a balance -- report on tensions, which tend to be popular with readers, but also cover environmental issues, human rights and other stories that struggle to find an audience."

geopolitics,3bmaos,rwat1,16,Tue Jun 30 11:36:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your question. I think that a good story in print is very likely to be a good story online, and so the writer briefs, structural edits and copy edits will often be similar.  What has changed is that a ""good"" story online may not necessarily get read, and online publishing has very much become a numbers game. That encourages publishers to run slideshows, listicles, etc.  Headline writing of course has changed dramatically. Clever allusions must often give way to key words and a degree of hype.  So new elements like these have come into play -- more so at some publications than others. But very often the editorial practices are quite similar, which you can see with publications like Foreign Affairs."

Bear in mind that we get a huge number of South China Sea pitches, and must necessarily be choosy. In contrast, we get very little on, say, Turkmenistan, and so a good story has a very good chance of being accepted. One mistake I think potential contributors make is that they see what is on the site, and pitch that. Better to pitch what is not there (assuming it fits into your area of expertise).  Also, if you offer a piece on spec (meaning you've already written it), it is useful to make sure it has a style and format similar to what you see on the site. Pitching on spec can be effective, but pitching your term paper, with endnotes and all, is unlikely to work.  Finally, don't give up. We have a number of writers who pitched a number of times before they were accepted. Some of them now write regularly.  Best of luck!"

I am currently a university student and while I try to keep up with world news to not only stay informed but to also have a good idea of things that may impact me, there is just so much to go through that I find my attention only drawn to issues that are within the U.S. (my home country) or whatever is currently ""hot"" (e.g. news about North Korea, FIFA scandals, etc.).  Where do you suggest someone in the U.S. focus there attention if they want to stay updated on worlds news that impacts their interests?

geopolitics,3bmaos,Doncuneo,14,Tue Jun 30 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a lot to get through, and the U.S. has interests worldwide.  The ""hot"" stories are often a good place to start -- they are hot for a reason. But they can be overblown. North Korean provocations are an example. The ability of the Islamic State to threaten the United States is another. However, the rise of China, and the responses of other countries in the region to its rise, is an important story that could have profound implications for the U.S. role in the world*, and so is well worth following.  One story that often does not get sufficient play is India-Pakistan tensions, in my view potentially the greatest risk to peace in the region, if not the world.  Rather than trying to go broad and keep up with everything, you might find it useful to go deep. Do read history whenever you can, as it will help you understand very broad trends and shifts. For example, understanding what happened to Japan 25 years ago can give you some very good insights into what is likely to happen to China over the next 10 years.  *Correction."

geopolitics,3bmaos,JediCapitalist,4,Tue Jun 30 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"A broad range. There are the traditional objections from affected industries, such as Japanese farmers and U.S. automakers.

Is such a reconciliation necessary to maintain the US's security position in the region?"
geopolitics,3bmaos,nordasaur,8,Tue Jun 30 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"The U.S. has certainly made some serious efforts to improve Japan-South Korea relations, hosting trilateral talks recently. For as long as Shinzo Abe is PM, a true reconciliation is unlikely, and I suspect Washington would be happy with manageable discontent. A complete Japan-ROK schism, especially given Chinese overtures to South Korea, would seriously complicate the Northeast Asia dynamic, which with the East China Sea, Taiwan and North Korea is already tricky enough. There is a reason, I think, why Abe's nationalist tendencies have been somewhat less in evidence of late."

But there have been fewer of the more public gestures (although I note that he sent his wife to Yasukuni recently).

Our approach to the problem of bias is to try to maintain a balance, by publishing voices from both sides of a given topic. On China for instance, we've gone to considerable lengths to get Chinese voices on the site, to balance the views of our Western, Indian and Southeast Asian writers.  Clearly, The Diplomat's greatest bias is that it comes out of a Western liberal democratic tradition. We don't try to correct associated preferences for human rights, free speech, etc. We do try, however, to counter our Western worldview, which often assumes that its truths are universal, with voices from other backgrounds."

geopolitics,3bli3h,lingben,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Ha! Classic Persian negotiation tactic - play good cop bad cop (Khamenei vs. Rouhani/Zarif) to confuse and frustrate the US team and push them all the way up to the July 9th deadline which will make them desperate enough to avoid the 60 day congressional review period.   The end result will be the US crumbling to dust and giving every single inch, just like they have been doing from the start because Kerry and the rest of the Obama administration know very well that the 60 day review period is just too much time with which to pick apart this agreement.  IMHO it has a 70% chance with a 30 day period and only a 10% chance with a 60 day review period. The Republicans have way too much to prove leading up to the 2016 election to let Obama have this.  edit: in case you hit the paywall:  VIENNA — The United States warned Iran on Monday, in both English and Persian, that a preliminary agreement reached two months ago in Switzerland must remain the basis for a final nuclear deal.  The warning appeared to reflect concerns among American and European negotiators that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been attempting to backtrack on some crucial elements of the April agreement that was forged in Lausanne, the lakeside resort near Geneva.  “We do see a path forward to get a comprehensive agreement that meets our bottom lines,” said a senior United States official, who could not be identified under the ground rules for briefing reporters. “This path forward has to be based on the Lausanne parameters. Period.”  To reinforce the message, the official turned to an aide who repeated the message in Farsi.  The United States and its negotiating partners are no longer trying to meet the original Tuesday deadline for wrapping up a final accord. Yet American officials hope to conclude the agreement so it can be submitted by July 9 to Congress, which would then begin a 30-day review period.  “No one is talking about a long-term extension” of the negotiating deadline, the official said. “No one.”  The briefing came during a break in the talks during which Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, spent the day in Tehran in what appeared to be an effort to reconcile the terms of the prospective agreement with Ayatollah Khamenei’s recent pronouncements in which he seemed to back away from crucial elements of the April understanding, including how long Iran’s stockpile of nuclear fuel would be frozen and how free international inspectors would be to demand access to Iranian military sites believed related to its nuclear program.  European and American officials expect Mr. Zarif to return on Tuesday, but it is unclear whether his instructions will be to strike a deal or not. In a sign that the talks will intensify in coming days, the Iranian news media reported that Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s atomic energy organization who has been ailing, would be accompanying Mr. Zarif when he returns to the negotiations here.  Mr. Salehi and Ernest J. Moniz, the United States energy secretary, who is in Vienna, had productive talks during the Lausanne round, and Mr. Salehi’s absence had been seen as a potential obstacle. Mr. Zarif will also be joined by Hossein Fereydoun, a younger brother of President Hassan Rouhani, who was also present in Lausanne, the Iranian news media said.  The remaining issues concern the scope of inspections, what arrangements might restrict the development of more efficient types of centrifuges after the first decade of the accord, the pace of sanctions relief and how to address suspicions that Iran has engaged in covert work on nuclear designs in previous years.  The senior American official discounted reports that the United States was seeking to renegotiate arrangements it agreed to in Lausanne that would allow Iran to use the underground installation it has built at Fordo for research instead of shutting it. Those provisions allow Iran to keep 1,000 centrifuges in that installation, but only a small portion can be operated in cascades to produce isotopes and none can be used to enrich uranium for at least 15 years.  “We are where we were in Lausanne,” the official said, referring to the Fordo installation.  But the official declined to say if the United States might agree to adjust some elements of the Lausanne framework in return for new Iranian concessions.  “We are building this understanding on the Lausanne parameters, and I am not going to go further than that,” the official said in response to a question. “I am not going to negotiate here.”  One major issue of crucial importance to the Iranians is the timing to suspend or remove economic sanctions. While details remain to be worked out, it appears Iran may use the two or more months needed to get the accord through Congress, and the additional time it would take to pass a new United Nations Security Council resolution, to begin storing its centrifuges and ridding itself of more than nine tons of low-enriched uranium.  That would speed the time it would take Iran to quality for sanctions relief. Previously, Iranian officials had said they would never ship the material out of the country, but it now looks like they may have no other choice, officials say.  It is not known who Mr. Zarif met with in Tehran and whether he consulted with Ayatollah Khamenei. But Iran has a special council on nuclear issues, made up of top security and foreign affairs figures that oversees the negotiations and reports to the ayatollah.  Mansur Haqiqatpur, a senior Iranian member of Parliament, said that an agreement was possible if the Americans stopped their “bullying attitude.”  The goal, he said, was to reach an accord by July 8, he added, indicating that Iran, like the Obama administration, also had the United States Congress in mind.  If a deal occurs later in the summer, the congressional review period would double to 60 days because of the August congressional recess. That would give critics more time to try to drum up opposition to the agreement and also delay the time when sanctions on Iran might be eased if the accord is enacted. Ayatollah Khamenei has said that sanctions must be lifted quickly.  American officials denied Iranian newspaper reports that President Obama has recently sent a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei urging him to pursue an agreement."

No one took the Iraqi military seriously even though they successfully invaded Kuwait with their tanks, missiles and planes because they simply didn't possess the technical superiority to counter a first world military response.  The West could run over Syria and lay waste to all military assets in the region in short order if we so chose. There are no major military powers in the region that pose a significant threat to us. One of the big reasons that we don't is because it wouldn't actually solve the problem as we seem to keep forgetting. It's a problem that needs to be handled by the locals, as the Kurds are showing us."

Graham is also running for President, and considered the ""expert"" in foreign policy among the Republican field. By exaggerating the ISIS threat, he hopes that people will pay more attention on foreign policy, which should help his candidacy.  Likewise with McCain.

What will not be as simple is to take control of the suburbs and of the city itself. I expect that fight will neither be fast or easy.

geopolitics,3bhvuu,nickottens,44,Mon Jun 29 10:28:44 2015 UTC,"This article is terrible, and really should be put under the category of editorial.  This is essentially reporting two different stories as one, and linking them together in a way that probably isn't true.  First, it reports that Erdogan's statement that he wouldn't accept a Kurdish statement in northern Syria. This is somewhat a departure from his past policies, including where he said a few years ago that he wouldn't violently oppose a Kurdish state. However, that was specifically relating to northern Iraq, not Syria. So this is a departure from past statements, but not a huge one: the best case scenario for the Turks at the moment is an autonomous Kurdish area in the north of Syria, which is what is likely to happen for the Kurds in the long run.  The second, bigger, story that is being reported is that the Turks have requested authorization to move a significant number of troops into northern Syria, specifically ISIS held territory, to create a buffer zone to keep the conflict from further spreading into Turkey. Turkey has suffered because of the conflict: weapons, fighters, etc have entered into Turkey, and a number of Turks have been kidnapped by ISIS. Making this push helps secure Turkey proper, and keeps the conflict in Syria, which the Turks want. The proposed advance does not include Kurdish held areas. The article admits this: it stretches from near Kurdish held Kobani to the town of Mare, held by the FSA and other non-islamist or government forces. The territory that will be occupied is held by ISIS. This will considerably help the Kurds and FSA, as they will not need to fight the Turks, and it will deprive ISIS of hundreds of miles of territory to recruit from. Now, I'm not saying that Turkey isn't doing this with some concerns RE the Kurds in mind. The Kurds are on the offensive at the moment, and part of the motivation for this offensive is those advances. The Turks would rather hold the territory themselves, rather than let the YPG overrun ISIS held territory (though the probability of the YPG overrunning all that territory is low), because it gives Turkey a better negotiating position. But the primary motivation for the attack is to secure Turkey, as they are only planning to attack areas that are under ISIS control.  The article is really an editorial because it wholly links the two stories, despite the facts. The title implies that Turkey will invade Syria and attack YPG held areas, but in reality the Turkish plan is to occupy only ISIS held territory. Any moves against the Kurds are more oblique in that Turkey will occupy territory that the YPG might want to drive ISIS out of sometime in the future"

geopolitics,3bhvuu,ofarrizzle,7,Mon Jun 29 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"The stretch of territory that Turkey's buffer zone is set to comprise was likely one of the YPG's next targets. After the seizure of Tal Abyad, Jarablus is IS's only remaining open border crossing, the only major port of entry for the thousands of foreign fighters IS relies upon to cover losses. Ankara has, in the past six months, seen the YPG - a close affiliate of the PKK, which waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey - take control of most of the border. I can't imagine Turkey wants to see anymore of the border fall to the YPG, but it can't attack them due to their close cooperation with the US.   I think what's happening is that they're going to take the remaining IS territory along the border so that the YPG can't. It's plausible that Washington acceded to this as a compromise, that IS's control is ended but the YPG wouldn't further expand Rojava. The question is whether Turkey will tolerate the movement of IS fighters through its buffer zone in Syria as it has tolerated their movements within Turkey."

Right now they're sucking up to the Gulf Arabs because it's the only region in the world that is ready to spend billions for political reasons. It's perfect for a country like France that is struggling to stay competitive and keep its industries alive. They simply can't compete with the US and Germany. They also don't really want to play second fiddle to America like the UK. However once Iran opens up they'll drop the act and start sucking up to them.  It will be difficult. Iran without sanctions is too big of a market to miss and the advantage will be with Tehran. There won't be any politically dubious mega-deals especially since they are a western country and not a friend of Iran. They will have to compete against other western europeans.

Since 1871, France has muddle along in the current of event that swirls around Westerner Civilization, but has made little contribution to it or the world; neither their population nor their economy has grown in relative size since that point. One wonders if the brief fits of reform and growth in France were internally motivated; Napoleon was a Corsican and France last reached a period of bold ambitions under his nephew Napoleon III; his bold plans for absorption and reform of Latin America were dashed by France's defeat by Prussia.  De Gaulle talked a good game and French economist in the 1960s were some of the first to warn of the impeding disaster of US dollar global hegemony, but over all France merely recovered from war; it did not undergo significant internal reforms.  So, today the French wax poetic about their ""high culture"" and fall in love with themselves over the ""beauty"" of their poetry and philosophy, but the rest of the world, including the rest of the West, is not pay any attention to it. The French may be impressed with fluff (""high culture), but in the real world it is power that counts and power is real and material; a factor of material production. To that point, South Korea produces eight times as many patents as France; and 1.6 times as many as all of Europe; so much for ""Grandeur""."
geopolitics,3bk65c,Dolcester,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with France is that they hit their limit a long time ago. They've been incredibly lucky to have come this far and it wasn't because of them. It was because of their friends.  They used to be dominate in the Europe because the UK didn't care. Russia was poor and beyond the German states. Italy and Germany were woefully split and divided. They also had vast amounts of colonies they could rape to power their nation.   The mid 19th century was when things changed. The Industrial revolution meant that you could build a strong domestic economy based on local industries, railroads, coal mines and steel plants. They were worth much more than taking money from poor Africans and Asians. At this time the US started to become the largest economy in the world without a colonial empire and the Prussians created a German economic zone.  The 1871 war and the period afterwards showed that a united Germany even without vast colonies is much more powerful and wealthier. The greatest saving grace for France was that the UK joined WW1 and stopped the Germans from overrunning them. After WW1 they went on a mission to permanently cripple Germany and they still couldn't compete against a weakened Germany.   When they and the UK waged an imperialistic war on Egypt to seize the Suez canal after WW2, they were opposed by the new real powers. The US and USSR. Both nations backed down and the UK gave up all pretension of independent foreign policy from the US. The French didn't and for a time they were lucky. The European community that was created was perfect for them since countries like West Germany and Netherlands were meek internationally. The French were the ones in charge politically while the Germans dominated economically. This bolstered them because they were at the head of one richest political block in the world.  Now they aren't. The Germans are no longer playing second fiddle. They want to have a say and their voice is the biggest. America is also more dominate over the EU today than it ever was in the Cold War when thousands of American troops were stationed. Eastern European countries care more about what Germany and the US has to say than France. French attempts to create a Mediterranean union that excluded most of the EU (especially the UK, Germany and other rivals) was shot down very quickly.  They have nowhere to go but down and so far their best plan is to get even more attached to the US and Germany. A far cry from the days of De Gaulle. The world is moving on and they are running on fumes. In 2000 France would have never played second fiddle in solving Europe's biggest political crisis. Now Hollande and Sarkozy have no other idea than to follow Merkel's lead.  The best example of how far they have fallen is South Korea as you mentioned. The French attacked them in the 19th century and stole valuable stuff from them. For more than a hundred years the idea of returning any of those items wasn't even a possibility. A couple of years ago when the EU was racing to sign a FTA deal with SK, the French returned the items. They needed the deal with South Korea more than South Korea did. The Koreans were already busy negotiating with the US and China and the EU wanted its FTA deal to come first."

With Britain largely retreating from international affairs, France stands alone as the only other Western country willing to undertake major geopolitical initiatives.

The difference between the UK and France is that the UK can see the writing on the wall. The UK has no issue playing second fiddle with the US because our governments share the same interests. This makes UK more influential since it has more sway over the real power. This started after the Suez Canal debacle revealed that the USSR and the US wouldn't put up with imperialism that doesn't benefit them and they were the real power brokers.  France decided after that to carve it's own niche particularly in poor countries that the rest of the world has little interest in such. They used to be incredibly independent back in the old days even if the US disagreed. The biggest advantage they had was the original EU group when it was essentially them, a meek West Germany and other countries. They were in charge politically while the Germans were in charge economically. They refused to allow the UK to join at first and even left the EU.  However steadily the reality is catching up to them and they know it. All of their previous advantages have eroded and they are becoming a smaller player even in the EU. Now they tow the line internationally with American policy and to Germany in Europe.  This offer the US a bigger ability to influence and dominate the world since the EU is a block the equal of the US. But it doesn't offer it flexibility. Unlike Russia that is willing to ignore the US, everyone knows that the EU countries only do what the US wants them to do.  Especially to Iran that negotiated with the EU in 2003. They came up with a good nuclear deal that the EU countries and Iran liked. They saw the EU turn the deal down and break the accord they already signed because Bush disagreed with it. It's why the current negotiation was started because of secret US-Iran talks. When the Americans were offering absurd and stupid demands there wasn't any pushback from the EU countries. The real negotiations had to start with the real powerbrokers.  As a Brit from a former colonial colony I find it amusing because you get funny moments. For example when Obama got elected rebels in Chad were close to toppling a French backed dictator. The French did nothing for days while they waited to see how Obama would react. When he didn't care they went full swinging to protect their puppet leader. In the Libyan civil war they pushed for a no-fly zone. When Obama disagreed they dropped it. When Obama was convinced by his own guys, they jumped at it. They showed off even though most of the heavy lifting and real work was done by the US military. Then there was Mali. They struggled after a few days and had to blackmail the US through the media to help them.

Either way, my broader point was less about whether France can conduct independent interventions abroad and more about their financial and diplomatic usefulness.  Because French foreign policy is broadly in sync with American foreign policy - more so than German or British foreign policy is - France and the US can bounce off each other in a manner not dissimilar to ""good cop, bad cop"".  France can help satiate the GCC while the US goes forward with nuclear negotiations, and when the US goes back to the GCC, France can keep Tehran in the fold.

I would have to say that Germany is much more important because they have more diplomatic clout especially with Iran, seen as a non-threatening and the potential economic benefits of trade with them is much larger. They have their own niche that works well for them. France is essentially trying to be a mini-America."

A CSG contains:    Ship type number under a CSG CIWS per ship AA/AM missiles per ship (without reloading)    Super Carrier 1 3-4 24-32   Guided Missile Cruisers 2 2 up to 122   Guided Missle Destroyers 3-4 2 up to 180   Attack Submarines 1-2 N/A N/A   Replenishment Ships 2+ 0-2 0    That's 13 to 20 CIWS alone, on top of the possible 996 AA/AM missiles ready to go at any given time. You're looking at needing several THOUSAND missiles, in order to deplete a CSG's anti-missile defense network. That's without even considering the fact that every one of those surface combat vessels carries advanced EA/EW capabilities designed to counter missiles without even using 1 of their own, and it's pretty well known the US' EA/EW capabilities are the best in the world, so that means they're absolutely nothing to laugh at.  Nevermind that it would take multiple missile impacts to sink a carrier, especially a Ford Class.. so you'd have to evade US anti-missile systems multiple times to even sink it. That's also not even adding in that a carrier is actually the single fastest surface vessel in the US Navy, thanks to the unreal power generated by the nuclear power plants, and the fact that a large number of those long range anti-ship missiles, you have to desigate a location, not a target, and you're gonna have to hope your target's still there when the missile gets there.  The whole ""BUT CHINA CAN SINK DA CARRIERZ!!!!11!!!"" story is written by people who have no idea about military technology, outside of what they may of briefly read on wiki before writing their article.

However, US doesn't use active sonar outside of times of war, for the reason /u/jheohdgs mentioned. We only use passive sonar (essentially high powered microphones listening to sounds underwater), which is fucking incredible for long range scans when you're on your own and can isolate the sounds of your own ship from those of others... but when you're in a multinational exercise? Someone could be blasting Mariah Carey at full volume 10 feet from the microphone, and you'd never notice.   Active sonar is far better for closer detection, and really it's the only thing you can use if there's more than just your ship in the area. But we can't just run it 24/7 because it essentially scrambles sealife's brains, and kills them."
geopolitics,3bewme,lordderplythethird,4,Mon Jun 29 16:30:17 2015 UTC,I always heard that the US does not turn on active sonar in those exercises because it is damaging to marine wildlife
geopolitics,3bewme,jheohdgs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"Well the USS Dallas ""kill""  occurred during a specifically ASW exercise (Oct. 2013) with USS Bulkeley and the source from the article indicates that it   ""...was broken down into three phases. The ships and submarines initially tested acoustic and non-acoustics sensor performance against known positions, gaining useful real life data for the region.""  ""Additional helicopter support to the ships was ably provided by the Anti-Submarine sonar dipping Merlins embarked in HMS Illustrious and USS Bulkeley’s Seahawk, with Westminster’s Mark 8 Lynx helicopter providing an additional surface search and weapon carrying capability"".   Either you heard wrong or the submarine crews are taking advantage of marine wildlife protection. Not using sonar indiscriminately is one thing but to not use active sonar during ASW drills completely defeats the point. If so, then I do not know what to say."
geopolitics,3bewme,hollayuki,3,Mon Jun 29 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"Not using sonar indiscriminately is one thing but to not use active sonar during ASW drills completely defeats the point   Not at all. Active (pinging) sonar is only authorized for use for very few ASW drills, with extremely strict monitoring, to make sure no marine life is endangered, in accordance with the MMPA (Marine Mammal Protection Act).   The Navy's own EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) and OEIS (Overseas Environmental Impact Statement) even states:   the Navy will adjust training and testing activities to support current and planned Navy requirements, including limited sonar use    Plus:   tested acoustic and non-acoustics sensor performance   In no way means active and passive sonar. It means sonar of some kind (again, likely passive), and MAD (Magnetic Anomally Detection), likely from a P-3 out of the Schellyes, since Nimrods are gone, and the Royal Navy has no MAD-capable aircraft. MAD essentially flies with magnetic field registers, in order to detect minute changes in the magnetic fields. The dipping sonar used by the Merlins, is capable of passive and active sonar, thus leading to the question of, well, which one did they use?  Another reason active sonar is hardly used, is because it gives away your location. Nothing helps someone find your ship faster than sending out a massive audio ping, so using active sonar in the Indian Ocean (like the USS Dallas exercise in 2013 was) is begging to draw the attention of all the Irani/Indian/Pakistan/Chinese/etc subs and surface vessels in the area. So you use your passive sonar to avoid alerting them to your testing, and you improve your passive sonar skills, while still holding the active sonar card in your hand so to speak.  Thus is the ASW world."
geopolitics,3bewme,lordderplythethird,2,Mon Jun 29 19:50:01 2015 UTC,Would it be possible then to deploy some sort of active sonar that either towed behind a vessel with a data link or uses some sort of wireless communication that has a narrow beam?
geopolitics,3bewme,RevengeoftheHittites,6,Mon Jun 29 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Well, there's the TSA (Towed Sonar Array), which is a passive sonar system that's designed to be towed behind the vessel, as a way of being able to reduce the sounds you pick up from your own ship. The US Navy created the AN/UQQ-2 TSA, which incorporates an active sonar system within it. This active sonar operates on LF/VLF frequencies IIRC, which gives extremely far and accurate results, while not effecting marine life, as well as reducing the audible source. Though I believe it's experienced a ton of cost over runs and has been delayed, like virtually all military projects. Been out of the community for a while now though, so I'm not sure on the current status of it."

There has been, he explained, a “striking contrast between the ideological claims and the actual policies pursued” by China. Communist China’s foreign policy moves since 1949, he wrote, have been based on the fundamental national interests of China. Whether it was the frontier with India, the question of Tibet, or the response to U.S. military moves near the Yalu River or in Southeast Asia, Mao’s China acted no different than China would have acted under Chiang Kai-shek.   This is why geopolitics is so fascinating.  Although, I'm pretty sure Chiang wouldn't invade Korea at Stalin's behest - but that's simply because he was part of a different alliance.  Also:   Morgenthau summarized what he believed to be the best, most effective U.S. policy toward China, and Asia as a whole: establish and hold a defense perimeter “following the island chain from Japan to the Philippines, leaving the mainland of Asia beyond.” The Chinese, he wrote, are “predominant on land,” while our strength is at sea and in the air.

Let me tell you from my perspective as a German born in Berlin in 1987. In school I learned about all the good things America has done for Germany after the war like the Marshall plan, the de-nazification and the Luftbrücke. Those are the things my parents and grandparents lived through and remember (the current ruling generation).   While I grew up on US television programs what I lived through is very different from the painted picture. What I remember are useless wars, human rights abuses , torture and spying.  So I dare say that the US-German relationship might not be as strong when my generation comes into power. Sure, the underlying reasons for the alliance will be still there but there is also the reality that European security can not be achieved without Russia."

I once asked an airforce officer if about a MANPAD. He said it is useless because it can't hit targets above 6 km, all he has to do is fly higher than 6 km and blast away. The problem is that requires longer range weapons aka more expensive weapons.   We can build stealth bombers and hypersonic missiles but can we really blast China or Russia's armies to pieces with these? We almost ran out bombing Libya.   These weapons are very good for limited and precise operations, for a WWIII we need to focus away from airpower and focus more on ground forces."

The article takes a look at the trees--so to speak--and you bring up the forest.  Yes the American military has a larger military budget, but in the area of hypersonic missile (delivery) and fighter planes all three are very very close.  The reason being two fold. For the case of the missiles, all the while the US was busy in Afghanistan and Iraq, China invested in asymmetrical capabilities (like hypersonic missile delivery systems). For the second case, China literally stole the plans of the F-35. So yes, they're in an arms race seeing they have the same technology in this particular domain."

Also, the manufacturing and labor cost in China for the same advanced MBT is 50% cheaper in China than in the U.S., so China can build far more materials/equipment using the same $1 US dollar than the U.S. can.

Furthermore, the Chinese have no choice but to go back home, considering the ""stringent caps on work visas"" which is just one part of the broken immigration system in the US. This system ends up abetting tech transfer in lieu of what used to be a highly successful brain drain mechanism.

The main concern that I've heard from an expert in the firm is that the Greek exit will cause a snowball effect in Europe where other less stable countries such as Spain, and even other countries as well to exit. The certain loss of countries from the Eurozone will cause an incredible downgrade in the Euro which could potentially cause the Euro to cease to be all together. Once this happens, the Euro will stop having any worth, causing many banks to become insolvent. Thus most western banks, including one's in the U.S., will face an enormous crisis because their Euro's in stock will become worthless. This however is a very very remote scenario, but it is on every investors mind in the U.S. Also as an addendum, Greece is also asking Russia for help with their finances which could prove very troubling for many nations in that region."

Much, much less likely but a card Greece could play would be leaving NATO and Western economic structure behind completely.  They could completely stiff the EU on any and all loans now and forever ( a default usually Dosen't mean no one will be paid, just not on time and not as much and the banks usually get it all in the end if the country wants to borrow again in the future). That and outright joining a Russian military alliance ( not just leasing a base or two) all for lots of Russian money and support ( Russia still has ~400 Billion dollars or so in currency reserves) would really cause some trouble for Europe. Greece could have very easily ended up communist/Warsaw pact after WW2 so it wouldn't be that far fetched to see them jump sides and screw Europe hard on the jump over if they feel disrespected and have little else to lose."

geopolitics,3bad5x,FeatsOverComments,12,Sat Jun 27 08:19:51 2015 UTC,"This article is some pretty grade-A baloney.  Yes, a ""multi-polar"" world seems great on paper. But the truth is the world has always been multi-polar. Unipolar would mean the US maintained control over all parts of the world. It's had influence, sure, but never control.  ""Western values"" (share political power and don't be a dick to your people) have by no means erased or supplanted existing cultural norms in other parts of the world.   Furthermore, multi-polarity is always predicated on balance. As with any system that relies on balance, it requires constant hands-on management to maintain said balance. Look no further than pre-WWI Europe for an example of a system based on balance that, like anything else balancing in this world, eventually crashed.  Lastly, while congressional reluctance to reform the IMF and World Bank are valid points, Russia and China both sit on the UNSC. That's a lot of power to hold, as both countries have used their veto power repeatedly. That's a pretty small club of countries, and India is largely more deserving than Russia is at this point.  But where this article really goes off the rails is where the author suggests ""rebuffing Russian efforts to join NATO"" was a driver of multi-polarity.  That's a heaping pile of bullshit. To quote one Russian official on the matter: ""Great powers don't join institutions, they create them"". Indeed, Russia's vision for security for Europe has always been parity with NATO and a balance of power, maintaining Russia's influence over territory it believes should in fact bend the knee to Moscow. it's against human nature to willingly allow an adversary, who spent the better part of 60 years threatening to turn Europe into a radioactive hellscape, to achieve military parity just for the sake of balance. Either way, it was NATO that entertained the idea of Russia joining, not the other way around.  The international system is in need of reform. But attempting to create parallel blocs will not bring the safety and security this planet needs. On the contrary, it breeds suspicion and competition. History is littered with the ruins of countless proud kings and countries who were destroyed by regional neighbors after a system in balance inevitably collapsed. If the Chinese were the true students of history the author suggests, that point would not be lost on them."

The world has usually been multi-polar. However we are just coming off an era of Unipolar American rule. The main interest in the US isn't to spread ""Western values"", it's to cultivate allies that will help advance their interest. Which is for example why they protected Ethiopia when it violated a UN SC Arms embargo on North Korean weapons and violation of a UN Border commission that. Take South Sudan as well. They had a UN arms embargo on them and Somali pirates captured a ship with 33 T-72 tanks. That public exposure should have resulted in consequences.  Another more disgusting example would be Saddam gassing Iranians and Kurds. It's illegal to gas people and Saddam spread gas like rice at a wedding. It wasn't hidden and he didn't suffer anything until he messed with the US by invading Kuwait. Even then the US and the UK pushed for sanctions that totally destroyed Iraqi society and were kept on despite the dismantling of the wmds. The only thing an American president feared was domestic reaction and not international consequences.

Look no further than pre-WWI Europe for an example of a system based on balance that, like anything else balancing in this world, eventually crashed.   A multi-polar world is a world where there are consequences for each action taken. It's a world where great powers are forced to act by certain rules they can all agree on. If one country oversteps and does something the others find objectionable, they will find that other countries will either push back and escalate or do something equally objectionable to their interests. We've already seen what happens when a nation has too much power and the end result isn't good.  The world we are living in is a different from Pre-WW1 Europe. That one had the idiotic Tsar Nicholas II. His absolute power meant that there was nobody else that could reverse course until the entire Tsarist system collapsed. In todays world, nations would learn from something like the Russo-Japanese war instead of doing what the Tsar did which was to learn nothing and make the same mistakes again.   That's a pretty small club of countries, and India is largely more deserving than Russia is at this point.   Not really. Russia has a country has more capabilities than India. It also represents more countries and has more influence than India. India at the moment is starting it's journey to being a great power. At the moment they are trying to become a regional power. They can't even tell Sri Lanka what to do. The nations which should really be questioned are the UK and France. Russia has it's own sphere of influence carved and China defers to it in aspects that isn't vitally important to them. The UK and France have no such thing. We're essentially tied to the US and do only what the Americans want us to do. We can't even fight in Africa against poorly armed men without the American military helping us."

This was a policy they inherited from the British Empire. For centuries our biggest concern was to make sure that one nation didn't dominate the continent. It's why we fought so many wars against the French, stopped the Russians from taking Istanbul and got closer to France once Germany united. The US also did this in the Middle East. It spent a lot of money and effort to make sure that Arabs in the 50s and 60s didn't create one giant secular Arab country. Stretching from Morocco to Iraq.  The one weakness to this is obviously that at some point a nation will emerge that just by its self will be able to dominate the region in question. In the 19th century it was Germany. The Austrians and French tried to keep Germans states weak and divided but got outmanoeuvred by Bismarck and defeated one at a time. A united Germany just by its self was capable of dominating the continent and needed the UK, America, troops from colonies and four years to be defeated.  Now we have China. The US is trying to stop them from dominating SE Asia and E Asia and contain them militarily and economically. That is a losing process.

Thats exactly it. When there are no checks and balances and no pushback people do whatever they want to do. The problem for Americans at the moment is that their leaders are people who grew up when the Soviet Union was declining and during the era of unipolar world. When they see other countries do what they do they moan. They moan about Russia sending weapons and fighters to Ukraine and you have to laugh at the language Americans use and their inability to see the hypocrisy.  There is very little they can do about it and they don't like it. They were happy to abuse their cyberwarfare to sabotage Iran and threaten military retaliation if Iran did the same to them.

The ""weakness"" idea is the idea of ""a"" (singular) nation dominating things.  Sooner or later the world will be a global government. Some power (or group of powers) will take over the entire globe (or so much of it that the rest doesn't matter). The key question is who should that be and how should that be done.  Today Russia and China argue that the world should be founded on core principles, decentralized and should not be centered on any one nation. That multipolar idea was the core idea behind the UN.  Since the USSR voted to disband, the US has run across the world waging wars and trying to establish global hegemony with Washington (and secondarily London/Brussels) as the center of some sort of global western empire.  I would argue that my country, the US, is unfit for such a position. We are a nation built on genocide, conquer and war, and since WWII (and especially since 9/11) we've proven that we do not hold any sort of moral high ground or inherent goodness.  For one country (US) or one small group of countries (NATO or ""the west"") to rule the world's many different peoples is absurd. Such an entity can only rule by tyranny and force, just as the US has done since WWII (our routine overthrow of democratic countries that ""vote the wrong way"" are classic examples).  The only sane and logical option is a multi-polar world with a weak central government -- again, similar in concept to the UN (and similar in concept to the original/pre-Civil War ideas of the US Constitution).   They moan about Russia sending weapons and fighters to Ukraine and you have to laugh at the language Americans use and their inability to see the hypocrisy.   Yes, hubris is a dangerous character trait. That's doubly true for a nation which is armed with nuclear weapons, an aggressive history, and where many believe their government is somehow ordained by god.   There is very little they can do about it and they don't like it.   Let's face it, the US is in decline. In many ways, we're similar to the British Empire after WWII -- semi-bankrupt, a declining economy, and many trends in the world working against us.  The British faced the choice of ""socialism or barbarism"". At first they tried to choose both, the latter resulting in horrific guerrilla wars to maintain the empire (e.g. Malaysia) and the torture of some seeking independence (e.g. Kenyans). The former resulted in Britain's National Health Service and many other features that to a large degree softened the British Empire's collapse.  Today the US faces the same choice. Sadly, we seem to primarily be choosing the barbarism side of the equation."

The fact is Russia is not a reliable partner and the West missed its chance of making them so in their actions following the collapse of the USSR.

If China cannot manage its economic transition they are doomed to the path of Japan or worse. Demographics are not on China's side either.

There's a pretty big difference between the Russian people having anti-Jewish pogroms and the government suppressing political dissidents, and the US Army waging flat-out wars of genocide -- complete with US Army issued blankets deliberately infected with smallpox -- against Native Americans.  But given the timeframe, you're in some ways correct -- both have little to do with what's going on today.   Russia is a shadow of its former self.   The USSR's Communist Party Politburo ensured that when they voted to break the USSR up into over a dozen countries, agreed to the reunification of Germany (a country that attacked them twice resulting in over 40 million dead Russians), disbanded the Warsaw Pact military alliance, and withdrew hundreds of thousands of its troops from eastern Europe. Russia did not voluntarily do that if they wanted to be some sort of empire.   Unless China matures it will never be a global power.   I don't recall China ever saying it wanted to be a world power. You're projecting your thinking onto other countries.  I think this is the core of our problem. The US is an empire. We're going broke trying to maintain our empire, and the American people are increasingly sick of our never-ending wars and immoral skulduggery that the US government practices all over the world. It's clear the US is seeking a new enemy to justify our aggression, but creating Al Qaeda only worked for a few years as an enemy, and the other powerful countries don't want to play.  I'd recommend rethinking your views of the world. It isn't Russia or China that is running around the world attacking countries, overthrowing governments (elected or not) and torturing people on a worldwide scale -- those crimes are ours.  We hold no moral high ground and we're going broke trying to maintain our empire. Common sense says we need to scale back, withdraw and restore the republic and our civil liberties, but our corrupt and bungling government just keeps searching for an enemy, launching wars and bombing and killing people.

Gorbachev was implementing reforms because he saw no other effective alternative for pulling the Soviet Union out of its economic slump.   I don't recall China ever saying it wanted to be a world power. You're projecting your thinking onto other countries.

There is no way that we should have been able to launch multiple wars of aggression under Bush while cutting taxes -- that is insane. It not only undermines every economic principle, but it has allowed our corrupt, war-loving government to saddle the American people with $6 trillion in debt. That debt is making China rich and will make them richer for decades to come! Countries should not be able to do such things just to fight wars of aggression.  After that insanity -- with China (and Japan) loaning us the money -- China is right to want to end the insanity of the US government and to have us live within our means.   and it's constructing a navy large enough to rival the USN.   So what? Doesn't China have the right to build a navy? Does China conduct naval exercises off the US coast? Does China ring the US with military bases? Of course not -- but we do that to China. Where is the principles of reciprocity and equality?  We have a 200 year history of using our navy to attack other countries. Does China have a history of using its navy to attack others? Remember, we are the #1 threat to world peace, not China.

You're simply projecting the long history of American and European imperialism onto China.   No, we're going broke paying for Social Security and Medicare.   That is incorrect. Jimmy Carter passed a series of massive Social Security tax increases over many years to pre-pay for the retirement of the Baby Boomers -- what a concept, sound planning and longterm government thinking! But Reagan started pissing that extra money in the SS trust fund away on his useless military buildup, and Bush Sr. did the same and spent even more of the SS trust fund to bail out the crooked S&L banks during his presidency.  Even today after those sad episodes by those corrupt presidents, SS is not in bad shape -- it has been in worse shape before. A minor FICA tax increase and/or increase in the retirement age would completely solve all of Social Security's problems.  As to Medicare, thanks to Obama shoving his inefficient corporate medical system down the country's throats, the federal government will soon start cutting Medicare, much to all of our detriment.   whereas Social Security and Medicare combined take up roughly 61% of the budget.   Two points: First, Social Security should not even be in the federal budget. FDR passed SS as a standalone program with its own tax to pay for it. SS was only included in the ""combined federal budget"" under LBJ in the 1960s. LBJ used that budget gimmick to hide the massive war spending he was doing to wage war on Vietnam. So I'd suggest separating SS and its tax away from the federal budget and putting the firewall back in place between SS and the budget.  Second, if you the budget is a problem, the solution is easy: Radically slash the amount of money we spend on our gargantuan military. Pull US troops out of South Korea (they're more than wealthy enough to pay for their own defense), start closing down overseas US military bases, end some of the insane wars we're fighting, and stop our aggressions against Russia, China and others -- in other words, start acting like a normal country instead of the US trying to be the imperial center of the world.  We could cut our military budget by 50% and still be spending by far the most on war toys compared to any other country in the world.

The dollar being the reserve currency was not what enabled Bush to initiate two wars. The two wars and the tax cuts were financed using the budgetary surplus Bush inherited when he took office.   That debt is making China rich and will make them richer for decades to come   ...that's not really how foreign-held debt works. Furthermore, China has been able to gain wealth through an export-oriented economy and rapid industrialization, not through U.S. treasury bonds. The treasury bonds are a financial tool more than an investment vehicle.   China is right to want to end the insanity of the US government and to have us live within our means.   China's desire to have the yuan become the global reserve currency has nothing to do with any kind of altruistic intent to ""stop"" the U.S. or ""have us live within our means"". Its intent is to wield more influence over global trade such that it can shape the international system to benefit itself in the same way that the U.S. has for the past century. If China actually wanted a more equitable system, then they would advocate for the adoption of a global reserve currency such as the bancor.   So what? Doesn't China have the right to build a navy? Does China conduct naval exercises off the US coast? Does China ring the US with military bases? Of course not -- but we do that to China. Where is the principles of reciprocity and equality?   Don't misconstrue my words. I'm not referring to the fact that China is building a navy. I'm highlighting the fact that they are attempting to rival the size of the U.S. Navy, a navy whose primary purpose is power projection. China has already acquired one aircraft carrier and is constructing another. The utility of aircraft carriers lies in their ability to project power far from one's country. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck...   We have a 200 year history of using our navy to attack other countries. Does China have a history of using its navy to attack others?   This is an anachronistic comparison. The technology to project power globally did not exist when China's military power was at its height. China was also geographically isolated from the rest of the world throughout much of its history. That did not stop various Chinese imperial dynasties from colonizing Vietnam and Manchuria, though. Furthermore, China has existed for most of its history as an empire. Conquest is just as much a part of Chinese history as it is a part of European history or Middle Eastern history. Granted, I don't think China will attempt any kind of global expansion of its territory, but believing that China won't attempt to project power globally if it becomes sufficiently powerful enough is simply naive and ignorant of recent trends.   So your position is that we should be opposing these economic development projects because China might act like the US -- even though China has no history of taking over the world and the last time that China built the world's largest fleet they attacked no one.   When did I ever state that as a position? You are awfully presumptuous. I'm referencing yet another example of China exerting influence outside of its borders. China currently has few means of forward deployment into Tibet or Xinjiang. A rail system through the western portion of the country would help immensely in keeping order there and is likely one of the motives for the Silk Road project.  Another thing, ""power projection"" is not ""taking over the world"".   You're simply projecting the long history of American and European imperialism onto China.   Oh, please. I'm applying IR theory and current events to predict the future actions of a country that has shown itself entirely willing to imitate U.S. strategies, right down to economic and monetary policy. That you're willing to ignore China's occupation of Tibet and Xinjing and its aggressive expansion into the South China Sea in order to maintain your perspective of the U.S. being the sole aggressor in the world demonstrates your substantial lack of objectivity when commenting on these issues."

European countries are so integrated borders are largely irrelevant; capitalists outright ignore them, and its mainly individuals that are subject to borders.   You are mistaking financial cooperation with a unification of governments. The EU is not a singular government, it is an intergovernmental organization that has been delegated fiscal responsibility by the constituent nations. It is not capable of enacting laws on individual countries, nor does it serve any military capacity. Countries are entirely capable of legally withdrawing from the monetary union (as opposed to an illegal secession a la the American Civil War). This would not be possible under a unified government. Borders are very much relevant because they mark the delineation between two separately enforced legal systems. Before you bring it up, NATO is also does not represent unification.  Also, what is the point of referring specifically to ""capitalists""? Who constitutes a ""capitalist""? It seems like such an irrelevant distinction to make in the current context.    The various ""free trade"" deals mean capitalists today are integrating countries -- just like the 19th century German principalities were integrated first with a customs union.   Again, you're conflating free trade with government unification. Each constituent country still operates its own military that is ultimately independent of the command structures of the other countries, despite their established ties with military alliances such as NATO. This means that the security dilemma, one of the cores of international relations theory, is very much at play, even between these supposedly integrated countries that you mention.   We've had 2 overt attempts at international governments, the League of Nations and the UN, with the UN being a stronger form of government.   Neither of those were attempts at ""world governments"". They are intergovernmental organizations. There is a major difference. The UN is also fairly useless and is mostly used by the member nations as a means of exercising soft power. The member nations are still sovereign.   Any world government will likely start out as some sort of confederation or federal system   This is from the page I linked:   There is thus no hierarchically superior, coercive power that can resolve disputes, enforce law, or order the system like there is in domestic politics. In International Relations, anarchy is widely accepted as the starting point for international relations theory.   Intergovernmental organizations are not a ""global government"" because their power is derived from the participation and cooperation of member nations, not from the organization itself. These organizations exist on the same hierarchical level as their member nations.  Edit:  I just saw this in your previous post:   The British faced the choice of ""socialism or barbarism"".  Today the US faces the same choice. Sadly, we seem to primarily be choosing the barbarism side of the equation.   Ignoring the fact that you consider the British government to be ""socialist"", are you seriously under the impression that the only alternative to socialism is ""barbarism""? That is such a ridiculous false dichotomy. It's hard to take you seriously when you say things like that while arguing against core tenets of international relations theory."

I encourage you to sink it to the bottom, but also to reply. I have removed my own vote.    Political strategy aside, whereby the Greek government is shifting the 'blame' for both outcomes onto the people of Greece... Is this not how democracy ought to work?  A government was elected on a promise to end austerity. They fought the good fight and ultimately failed. Hopefully they at least avoided a VAT on medicine and energy, and maybe a lower pension cut than would otherwise have been proposed -- but they still found themselves unable to make good on that promise. In light of that failure they have given the power back to the people.  Is that not a wonderful democratic action, in the sense of an honest 'contractual' engagement with the electorate?  I had hoped for nationalist squabbles to end, and for a truly sustainable economic model (or, more accurately, a more robust political union) to have been created. But I take at least a little joy in Syriza doing right by the Greeks."
geopolitics,3b8uua,MagikalGoat,6,Sat Jun 27 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"The Greeks will consider it utterly unfair, because as a union why shouldn't they have access to the emergency funds of the union?  In their minds the money of the collective is completely fungible and they have just as much of a right to it as say the Netherlands. They're neglecting that they haven't ""paid back"" the old amount with any deeds toward the union, and now they want more funds without austerity and to remain in the union. This won't end well, because there is just a massive cultural misunderstanding as to what is owed and owned here."

geopolitics,3b8uua,coupdespace,6,Sat Jun 27 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not, but who can? Parliamentarians seem just as overwhelmed as the rest of us: There is some sad footage of German MPs failing to answer some basic questions minutes after voting to construct the European Stability Mechanism. Questions like ""how much is Germany on the hook for"", ""can this thing be used to bail out banks as well"" or ""what countries have recieved money so far"". Europe often leaves it up to its judges, take the recent European Court of Justice ruling on the legality of bond purchases by the European Central Bank, so what about them?  People believed to know what they're doing have been behind the steering wheel for the past couple of years: A first referendum was denied to Greece (anyone remember George Papandreou?) and more generally, the outcome of elections has not been allowed to change the Eurogroup's strategy on how to deal with the crisis - a decision that, at least in my view, has done more to fan the flames of euroskeptic populism than any amount of money being moved from A to B, or any number of refugees and migrants arriving on Europe's shores.  So the idea is that the way to go is letting experts hammer out deals behind closed doors and then give them to politicians so they can tell us that There Is No Alterative. It's uncertain how good these experts are, though. The IMF has corrected itself on Greece before and economists can't agree on how to handle Greece or the eurozone in general either.  To me it really seems as if there is no person, group or institution that has proven itself to be uniquely qualified to be in charge here, and when that's the case, you might as well give power to the people, because you might not get the optimal decision, but you will get a decision which has legitimacy, something that Europe is in desperate need of right now.  And on a side-note, I'm generally opposed to the way we present political debates as problems to be solved by experts, problems that we little people could not possibly understand. It can't be good for democracy to repeatedly suggest that the electorate is, well, stupid. If we are, how do we know if we elect the right people?"

geopolitics,3b8uua,thiopentone,2,Sat Jun 27 08:56:41 2015 UTC,I think it would be interesting is if the IMF refused the 5 day extension Greece needs to hold the referendum. It would be a way for them to get the default over-and-done with rather than waiting for a democratic process.

geopolitics,3b8uua,wastedcleverusername,6,Fri Jun 26 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"I think this is a little simplistic.   Anti-bailout factors:    Germany wants to set the precedent that a country can't keep running up debts and expect to be bailed out. Germany's domestic audience hates the ""lazy"" Greeks. No bailout is going to solve the long-term problem of an uncompetitive Greek economy.   Pro-bailout factors:   Germany wants to keep the EU around, not just as an economic zone, but with the eventual hope of turning it into an actual political union. Abandoning Greece runs counter to this goal. If Greece leaves the Eurozone and sees an improvement in their economy, other countries are going to wonder whether or not they should do the same thing. Half the bailout money goes right back to French and German banks anyways."
geopolitics,3b8uua,SavannaJeff,2,Sat Jun 27 00:54:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think a Grexit will necessarily destabilize the EU. And the bailout money doesn't go to French and German banks, it goes to the state. Over 85% of Greek debt is held by 'official' institutions, like German, Finnish, French governments, the IMF, etc.  Simply put, there's little impetus to cave in to Greek demands, or save them from a default."
geopolitics,3b8uua,wastedcleverusername,4,Sat Jun 27 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the more creative options I've seen floated was for Greece to just start printing Euros... that would be interesting. I don't think a Grexit will destabilize the Eurozone financially by now, but it will have political ramifications down the line. For example, if they want to create a EU military for common defense somewhere down the line, states like Poland or Estonia are going to be asking themselves ""Wait, they wouldn't even pay a few billion to bailout Greece, can we really trust them to send people to die if Russia invades?""   The state took over a lot of the debt foreign banks held in Greece, so I suppose it's held by official institutions now... which still means the bailout money is coming right back. I agree that Germany is unlikely to agree to another bailout, but there are costs."

That is, the German and French (and other etc) banks have been able to disguise their obviously non performing loans and various other assets because it at least looks like Greece is going to pay them back (so by extension other countries like Spain who owe more are going to). If a Greek default becomes clear so will their assets dependent on loans to various European countries and this could be a European version of the 'sub prime' mortgage crisis."

Whereas the Rafale B and A remain slightly cheaper (IIRC Saudi Arabia is buying the B which is 82.6 million) and the Rafale M is more expensive- this is what India's navy is buying.

geopolitics,3b8jrz,FirstPotato,3,Sat Jun 27 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"ISIS is territorially-limited and relatively uninterested in initiating terror abroad.   I don't know. Sure, the majority of their fighters have primarily domestic concerns, and the group doesn't have the same logistical/institutional power to really spread terror abroad as other states have in the past.  Nevertheless, the number of foreigners going to the ME to fight is quite unprecedented, and in interviews they all seem quite determined to return to wherever they hail from ""Britain/Kazakhstan/Xiangshan you're next"" is something I've heard too many times.   Anyway, I think the main thing this article misses is that much of the problem with fighting attacks such as those we've witnessed recently is how good we are at counter-terrorism post-9/11–7/7. We're so good, in fact, that there's not been a single complex/orchestrated attack since, forcing a change of strategy towards more lone-wolf attacks with minimal communication and logistics (which typically open them up to the security services).   If anything, that's why this won't prompt much serious action: there's simply not much we can do—especially if we continue along the lines of hemming in our security services, since they're really the only ones standing between us and other attacks."
geopolitics,3b688b,godiebiel,12,Fri Jun 26 08:32:47 2015 UTC,"I think the fear of something like this happening is, at least in part, what Russia has predicated its policy toward Syria and the Arab Spring on.

And, while upon reading the ISW article in full, I see that this was actually noted in the article.

The resistance in the northern Caucasus has always been more about independence from Russia than extremism, and this resistance has been going on for generations. By swearing allegiance to ISIS, militants in Chechnya, Dagestan, etc are probably looking to piggy-back off of ISIS' popularity and gain new local recruits (and possibly some from Central Asia). This would mean less foreign igniter flooding into Iraq and Syria from Russia and Central Asia. Or conversely, this is maybe some grand plan of Russian intelligence to get all of the Jihadis to leave Russia to die in Iraq. And provides a good reason for Russia to step up support to Assad. In any case his just looks like business as usual in the Russian Caucusus."

I wouldn't be so sure.  IS does well because it co-opts pre-existing conflicts, especially those with sectarian and nationalist undertones.  It became prominent in both Iraq and Syria because it promised that its Islamic state was the only true solution to the repression of Sunnis by the non-Sunni governments in Damascus and Baghdad.  Given that the conflict in the Caucuses has already radicalized along similar lines, I don't think it's a stretch for IS to exploit that dissatisfaction."
geopolitics,3b688b,ofarrizzle,2,Fri Jun 26 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"Good points, and for a large part I agree. But how ISIS will exploit that dissatisfaction is what I don't get. ISIS seems to be more of a territorial entity than organizations like Al Qaeda, with them being tied down in a war in Iraq and Syria I don't see how they'd benefit from half of the Emirate of the Caucusus pledging ""allegiance"". As shown in the media, ISIS has benefitted greatly from north Caucusus recruits, in my eyes this is a move by local N. Caucusus resistance leaders to fight attrition, and gain popularity more than an actual expansion of ISIS."
geopolitics,3b688b,Ottomatix,3,Fri Jun 26 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit of both.  Militants in the Caucuses may get more money, potentially smuggled weapons, and most importantly foreign recruits with valuable skills.  For IS itself, it has been competing with Al Qaeda for the past year to build up a global network of local franchises, like AQ has, but with limited success.  Boko Haram pledged allegience, as did the main militant group in the Sinai and some fairly small militias in Libya.  But that's not much compared to AQ's franchises, like AQAP, AQIM, Al Shabaab, etc.  So IS is definitely open to affiliate organizations pledging ba'yah."

In their narrative, the borders of the IS are ever shifting. This makes it difficult to pin a decisive victory against them."
geopolitics,3b688b,ShutUpWoodsie,2,Fri Jun 26 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"/u/ofarizzle is correct, extremists are able to exploit these situations and effectively hijack their nationalistic movements. This is currently what they're trying to do in Xinjiang with the Uighers.   There was a Frontline report years ago about this Chechen conflict and how it was being usurped by muslim extremists. Lots of local leaders were converting to Islam and finding a new reason to fight. I can absolutely believe this article.    It's a shame I can't link that Frontline, since the PBS website only has a select few uploaded that you can watch. But I remember back on google videos before it was taken down, they had every old Frontline report on there. It was glorious.

It's a popular narrative that such movements have been hijacked, but the narrative that these movements were revived by Islamic extremism could fit this scenario just as well. As I mentioned earlier, in the case of Chechnya, their ultimate goal is the same. An independent Chechnya. The people leading the uprising aren't the same, but that should be expected in any case where a new generation takes up the fight."

Minsk and its bann of foreign troops is refering to the conflict zone and not all of ukraine.  The US Army in ukraine, even if only for training the regular ukr. army, is creating a strange situation though. The involvment of regular russian army elements is still an allegation, and even if very possible, without resilient proof. Regular russian army fighting in ukraine is mentioned in nearly every publication about the topic, sometimes more and sometimes less prominent. It's treated as a fact and repeated so often, for the public it becomes one. I myself find it very likely that small russian contingents are involved, but if or if not russien troops are really there isn't my point.  My point is it's still an allegation, but on the other hand we now have US troops there as an undeniable fact.  I read a lot of comments talking about russian propaganda, mostly treating everything differing from the US point of view as such.  But I find it to be in the realms of possibility that with the exception of crimea, at the beginning of the conflict russian help for the separatists was only through some help with logistics and turning a blind eye to russian volunteers going to fght in ukraine, even encouraging them to do so. But regular russian forces are so far just a claim made by kiev, and some western states, that is  treated as a fact, and this proposed fact now works as the occasion for the involvement of US troops.  I don't think it's only russian propaganda that is at work here.  Let's say the russians now sent their guys to train the separatist as a response... how can you say it's wrong if they do if you've done the same? The argument that one side is training official forces and the other the rebels isn't really viable considering the chain of events leading to the actual situation."

They are widely considered to be experimenting with democracy in Hong Kong.   China has been seeking to neuter Hong Kong's democratic government for a couple years, now, which is what inspired the protests that have been taking place over the last few months. The CCP has been expanding the scope of the Great Firewall and cracking down on dissent even more harshly. This has been accompanied by the censorship of a wider range of topics. It used to be that only the ""Three T's"" were censored: Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen Square. The censorship regime is now spreading to other areas, though, over the past few years.  Take a look at Document 9; it's basically an internal memo detailing the CCP's goal of eliminating ""Western elements"" from China, namely liberal values. For God's sake, the CCP pulled down the documentary covering China's massive pollution issues after a week and a half. If you go to Netflix you can find dozens of documentaries critical of the U.S. government. How many of them are taken down?   Democracies, as sad as it is, are becoming obsolete   Democracies/Republics are just as ""obsolete"" as autocracies are. Both have been around for millennia and will continue to exist after both of us are dead. The main issue with the ""spread"" of democracy was not the efficacy of democracy, but the conflict of democratic values with existent cultural values in the regions to which is spread. It is far more difficult for democracy to be fostered in the Middle East, a region that has experienced only theocracies, monarchies, and autocracies for the past few centuries. The Middle East has also never experienced a strong presence of Western culture and there is no analogue to the Enlightenment in Middle Eastern history. The only reason India has successfully implemented democracy is due to the fact that it was effectively occupied by Britain for an entire century. However, if you turn this logic around, you would see a similar failure of autocracy in places like the United States. That does not mean that autocracies are ""obsolete"". It simply means that some methods of governance are more compatible with a region's history and culture than others.   Morals and justice and ideals have no impact on the game of nations.   ""Morals"" and a general pursuit of ""justice"" have driven human action since the beginning of recorded history. ""Ideals"" have played a huge part in the formation and actions of states throughout history, as well.

Democracy, like communism, sounds great on paper and appeals to the common man, but is a bit hollow in practice.   Seems to me that when constitutions are ""flexible"" and civil rights are ignored in favor of ""public safety"" that it doesn't actually matter any more to the common man what form of government he is under. At least a dictatorship won't spend 8 years in stagnation because the president can't get along with congress."
geopolitics,3b55f3,JesusIsAVelociraptor,7,Fri Jun 26 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"Much like communism its all about the execution, unfortunately in the globalized world we're seeing that democracy is less responsive time sensitive issues. In addition, the need for effective interplay of state and corporations in achieving geopolitical goals- which has become a hallmark of our modern world- which requires power structures that don't easily fit into the classic notion of democracy.  The rise of ""deep states"" is a logical response -though not the only one- to the maintenance of geopolitical power."

And I'm certain the economic outcome will be a big part of the ""Remain"" campaign. Looking at the renegotiation, I don't see how Cameron can't find a way to declare victory.

More importantly, the exit of the UK would be immensely damaging to both Britain and the European Union.   Frankfurt can't wait to be the new 'City'. I don't see how the EU as a whole woould be hurt at all, not even from a PR perspective. From a geopolitical perspective Brexit would leave EU freer to play a less US-aligned role in the world (aka cozy up to Russia and China) while the US gobbles up the whole America Pacific region. For Europe this would make more sense then continue to be second-rate pets to an imperial master that's at least hesitant if not downright circling the drain.   The Irish vote resulted in a renegotiation and increased funding for the 2008 financial crisis. What would the EU offer the UK after a no vote?    A heartfelt farewell probably. But if you asked what could it give then... it doesn't really matter what they offer to keep Britain in. Germany doesn't really want the UK in, they'd be super happy to see UK crumble into mangeable pieces. It's Cameron's job to make whatever he gets look ""enough"" to his electorate so they don't vote incorrectly or to justify a second/third/fourth referendum."
geopolitics,3b3uaq,willkydd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"Two incomparable circumstances. In Ireland, less than 1% of the EU's population, voting on domestic political sentiment, not EU concerns, held back (and achieved substantial concessions) the will of the >99%. At its very worst, this was a case in which the EU recognised the interests of all the important powers involved (yet Ireland still got concessions).  Clearly the notion of the EU forcing the UK to hold another referendum is preposterous. Pro-EU politicians could, but even that's fanciful in the extreme. The unfortunate fact of the matter, and one in which I think we should agree, is that the popular vote in this case (more than in most) is extremely malleable, on the grounds that nobody knows what they're talking about or cares very much. It is for this reason, above all others, that I expect a Brexit will be avoided."
geopolitics,3b3uaq,Kameniev,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:33:00 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly enough I agree with most of what you said... yes the biggest way in which a referendum Brexit can be avoided is just massaging the public opinion prior to actually posing the question.  But I differ on one point. It's not EU politicians that would ""force"" Britain to ""re-take"" the referendum if at first it doesn't ""succeed"". It's Britain's own politicians who want to do so and who would have to justify it somehow. EU politicians (read Germany, France) would love to see UK out.  The whole tragicomedy of the situation Cameron put himself into is that he's sort of expecting to be wooed in but the rest of Europe is calling his bluff and nobody really cares that much about Brexit. Perhaps the EU would be weakened without Britain, but for Britain exiting the EU is an existential threat: it'll lead to Little England being out of the EU and Scotland seceding and joining the EU - it'd really be the the last nail in the Empire's coffin. I mean it's so stupid a move it's funny to think we could see Wales as an independent EU member as well :)"

I think ""EU politicians (read Germany, France) would love to see UK out."" overstates it somewhat, since the EU is only as powerful as its constituent parts, and if one takes the view that Germany commands Europe, this command weakens when one of Europe's big three quits.   I absolutely agree that Germany et al. will hardly lift a finger to keep the UK in—at most they'll cobble together some typical horse-trading deal that looks to Britain's uninterested and ignorant public like something substantial—and I agree that this position was totally avoidable, had Cameron thought for a second about what position Europe would likely take.   I've found both this, and this, by the CER to be the best written on his position so far."

Which I don't doubt you are as every one of your posts has something to do with defending the PRC."

So like I've already stated, if the PRC was practicing for an invasion of Taiwan, why would they release to the public that they were using an official map of the country? Do you think they are stupid?  Just the fact that the PRC has amphibious invasion capabilities is enough of a threat to the ROC to influence their decisions.  In 1995 the current president of the ROC went on a global tour.  Do you know what the PRC did in response?  The threatened the ROC militarily with the only real capabilities they had at the time.  They ""tested"" missiles by firing them into the waters surrounding Taiwan.    The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, also called the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis or the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, was the effect of a series of missile tests conducted by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the waters surrounding Taiwan including the Taiwan Strait from July 21, 1995, to March 23, 1996. The first set of missiles fired in mid-to-late 1995 were allegedly intended to send a strong signal to the Republic of China (ROC) government under Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving ROC foreign policy away from the One-China policy. The second set of missiles were fired in early 1996, allegedly intending to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate in the run-up to the 1996 presidential election.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis  There is a clear pattern of the PRC using military means in an attempt to intimidate the ROC.  Practicing an amphibious invasion in the waters near Taiwan with an Island of similar geography is clearly meant to send a message to the ROC and the US.  This is geopolitics 101.

It would have to rely on vulnerable civilian ships in the interim, which aren't adept at carrying equipment or even unloading troops other than at port facilities. Even then, Taiwan's geography makes amphibious invasion incredibly difficult, as the western lowlands - the only place to land - are either open rice paddies or dense urban terrain.  Some analysts have argued that there are only one or two beaches big enough to take a big enough amphibious force anyway, and by the time enough troops were unloaded to actually hold it, Taiwan could bring enough firepower to bear to destroy the force before enough reinforcements could arrive.  http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2000/9/fall%20china%20taiwan%20ohanlon/2000fall_is.pdf  https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/cee1306d-0372-47cb-8261-1c7d1a5f0422/How-China-Might-Invade-Taiwan---Wood,-Piers-M-,-Fe.aspx"

We all know those two categories have been prioritized for development since then. Not to mention that the US has refused the sale of ""advanced"" military hardware to Taiwan such as the F-16 C/Ds. Here's a relevant paper on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since the 90s from last year. It's a detailed and comprehensive report so I'll just let these quotes speak for themselves:   ""Overall, the Defense Secretary has told Congress in required annual reports on PRC military power that the balance of forces across the Taiwan Strait has continued to shift to the PRC’s favor. ""  ""Despite the closer cross-strait engagement, the PLA has continued to develop and deploy capabilities for potential action against Taiwan."""
geopolitics,3b1y5b,hollayuki,2,Fri Jun 26 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"Apologies, I should have specified which sections of those reports I was most specifically recommending.  They are really old, so most of the points about the technological contrasts are pretty out of date.  Other points, however, hold true.  More or less, the trend in Beijing's favor is entirely accurate, especially with regards to air and naval superiority (assuming the US does not intervene).  But that doesn't address the issue of the PLAN's amphibious capabilities or its ability to rapidly transport the necessary hundreds of thousands of troops onto a beachhead.  It's entire amphibious capability can transport only about two brigades of troops (8-10k) at a time, assuming all of them land simultaneously.  Considering the Taiwanese military consists of 280k active personal and more than 2 million reservists, who would undoubtedly be called up immediately during an invasion attempt, and the beachhead would be crushed before sufficient critical mass was reached.  Nor does it address the geographical and topographical difficulties of landing a sufficient invasion force in a short enough time period to be able to secure it from a rapid Taiwanese counterattack.  Simply put, Taiwan's geography limits the PLA to a few landing sites, and the Taiwanese military has enough firepower to make that limited geographical area an absolute hell, if not exterminate it entirely.  Even if the PLA is able to establish air supremacy, it wouldn't be sufficient to prevent a massive counterattack from Taiwanese ground troops and artillery, and the PLA would have massive difficulty expanding that beachhead through open rice paddies and dense urban terrain.  Then there's the mountainous interior, which could easily hide hundreds of thousands or even millions of Taiwanese troops and undoubtedly hides untold stores of weapons.  To be honest, hats off to anyone who could manage it."

No argument there.  I sincerely believe (and hope) that the Taiwan issue will not be resolved through an outright invasion. Let's not forget that the Battle of Okinawa took place not too far from there. What we should be looking out for I think, is any change in stance regarding arm sales to Taiwan due to the recent escalations in the South China Sea. If that were to occur, I'm afraid that could end up mirroring a Cuban Missile Crisis scenario. Not in a nuclear war kind of way, but the brink of war aspect."
geopolitics,3b1y5b,hollayuki,2,Fri Jun 26 04:40:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think reunification is possible unless there is massive political change on the mainland, i.e. multiparty elections.  The only alternative is de jure Taiwanese independence, which Beijing finds utterly unacceptable, but which is increasingly popular amongst Taiwanese themselves.  I don't think either side will take things all the way to war, because both know they can't win, but there's really almost no common ground either, beyond business arrangements."

Bush invaded and destroyed Iraqi society and created an environment where a group like ISIS emerged. However he also damaged the group to the point where they became irrelevant.  Obama's Syria policy allowed ISIS to use Syria to revive it's self. The permissive environment Obama created and the tacit support of America's allies allowed ISIS to rebuild and become a much stronger force than they ever where. His admin gave political cover for Turkey to allow thousands of jihadists to enter Syria. He not only allowed but actually helped import thousands of tonnes of weapons into Syria that were ending up in the hands of Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Since April 2013 ISIS was openly ruling large parts of Eastern Syria and were building up a formidable fighting force.  He was happy to ignore ISIS when it was only killing people against the US. I don't think he ever realised that it would blow back on him so badly. I'm not even sure they learnt their lesson. Every time they talk about Syria they act as if the mistake was to not have attacked Assad earlier. Instead of stopping their allies from sending in jihadists and weapons and leaving large areas of the country lawless."
geopolitics,3b2svz,redindh,4,Thu Jun 25 16:15:32 2015 UTC,Really? I get the impression the Obama administration isn't happy with the way Assad's enemies such as Turkey supported whatever enemies they could without considering the consequences and can't help but feel that it a major motivation in their desire to reach a deal in Iran to balance the ambitions Turkey and the GCC nations.
geopolitics,3b2svz,RevengeoftheHittites,3,Thu Jun 25 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"The motivation for making a deal with Iran isn't to counterbalance the GCC. It's to counterbalance China. Both Bush and Obama up to 2013 didn't really want to make a real deal with Iran. They wanted Iran to capitulate and sign a really shitty deal that didn't respect their sovereignty, didn't remove the majority of sanctions and could be cancelled at anytime by the US.  To keep the pressure on Iran the US needs to station a lot of forces in the region. The need to topple Assad was also because he was Iran's only ally and he refused to abandon them. Without Assad Iran would be isolated and surrounded. All of this was to make Iran give up. For the past 12 years they haven't given up and overcome any obstacle thrown their way. The Iranians stabilised Assad's government and the standoff was looking like it was going to last for a long time.  America doesn't have forever. It can't be wasting time in the ME threatening a regional power when the real threat to American global hegemony is China.  Oh and Obama has no problem with what Turkey and the Gulf countries are doing. What they are doing is illegal and it would be impossible for them to get away with it without American diplomatic protection. The US also helps them airlift and deliver weapons.   Another thing the US does is protect them from retaliation. If Syria attacks for example Jordan and the areas that harbour the jihadists. The US military will attack Syria.  Why is Obama doing this? Short-sightedness and a brutal cold logic. The best fighters against the Syrian Army are terrorists. They wish to kill and destory communities that primarily support Assad. At the moment they are protected by the Syrian Army. Obama wants the Syrian Army so weak and about to collapse that the fearful Syrians will make a deal.  ISIS is in the east, Al-Qaeda controls most of the North and there are tons of other terrorist groups with the same ideology running all over the country. When you add that to what happened to Libya. I really don't have a good opinion of Obama."

geopolitics,3b2svz,godiebiel,3,Thu Jun 25 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"That is true. The de-Ba'athification allowed the insurgency to have valuable men and when the extremists coalesced into ISIS it gave the organisation a strong institutional foundation.   That is the number one reason why ISIS after being so severely damaged  has managed to bounce back and become even stronger than they ever were. The policies of Obama and American allies created the fertile environment for ISIS.They created a front group to mask their identity (The US however was aware it was them). They took the lead in fighting the Syrian army and were responsible for some of the most important successes the rebels had. They also used the fact that a lot of the Syrian rebels were essentially criminals to their advantage. They would go into an area and just absolutely demolish groups small and powerful and take over their weapons, assets, fighters and locations.   Because of Obama's policies in Syria they were free to entrench themselves and they used Syria has a base to start weakening Iraq. They released high value prisoners, eliminated Sunni tribes that were opposed to them and slowly stretched their trendils all the way to Diyala and Baghdad. They took full advantage of the incompetence of Sunni politicians.   These guys are professionals terrorists and they make other groups look more like amateurs. They're so good they even survived the betrayal of their front group. JaN is inferior to ISIS but superior to other Syrian rebel groups.  For me this is Obama's legacy.

It rapidly becomes far cheaper and probably faster to just use a ballistic missile.  Guidance is also problematic if you want to hit anything that moves.  The sheath of plasma generated by an object falling from space is all but impenetrable to sensors that could track a moving target."
geopolitics,3ayci1,TanyIshsar,6,Wed Jun 24 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"It rapidly becomes far cheaper and probably faster to just use a ballistic missile.   Unfortunately, we run into the rather old argument of ""How do we know it's not a nuke?"" any time we look at deploying ICBMs with non-nuclear weaponry. You can see this dynamic at work with China's anti-ship ICBM. By that I mean they're building a weapon exclusively for its strategic value and leveraging the inherent ""Is it nuclear"" question to their advantage.  Rods from God as they're called fall into a precarious position in the 'strategic' vs 'tactical' discussion. Their weapons load and reach being so dynamic. Fortunately they can be built in such a way as to be third party validated as one or the other. This fact allows them to be leveraged in a way that ICBMs cannot, and that is of value. Possibly enough value to make the added cost a worthwhile trade-off."
geopolitics,3ayci1,SteveDaPirate,4,Wed Jun 24 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, and is undoubtedly a driving force behind the funding being poured into development of Hypersonic cruise missiles that avoid the flight profile of nuclear tipped missiles."
geopolitics,3ayci1,SteveDaPirate,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:46 2015 UTC,What're the practical limitations to tipping a hypersonic missile with a nuclear payload?
geopolitics,3ayci1,SteveDaPirate,4,Wed Jun 24 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"On the technical side, it is almost certainly feasible.    As far as policy is concerned, it would potentially violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.  It would also run afoul of the situation TanyIshsar brought in the earlier comment.  At the moment, the US would love to use conventionally armed ICBMs to quickly strike targets on the other side of the world.  Unfortunately, a conventionally armed ballistic missile looks identical to a nuclear tipped ballistic missile to Russian and Chinese radar installations.  The goal of the hypersonic cruise missile is that it would fill this gap, allowing the US to rapidly strike distant targets with conventional weapons, without triggering a nuclear retaliation from the Russians.  Arming hypersonics with nukes, would defeat the purpose they are being developed for."
geopolitics,3ayci1,SteveDaPirate,3,Wed Jun 24 20:10:23 2015 UTC,The intermediate range nuke treaty isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The Russians have already violated it.  The rest makes sense though.

geopolitics,3ayci1,alrvh92,5,Wed Jun 24 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"What the US has figured out with the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan is that against opponents fighting an unconventional war, it has more firepower than it knows what to do with.  Figuring out who or where to strike has been far more of a limiting factor than actually carrying out the strikes.  In the opening phases of each conflict, the US was facing conventional opposition where it was relatively easy to figure out who to attack.  As a result, the US brought overwhelming firepower to bear and wiped the floor with the opposition in a couple of weeks.  Subsequently, the opposition began hiding amongst the civilian population and carrying out clandestine operations.  As a result, the US had plenty of firepower but didn't know where to apply it, or had known targets but unacceptable levels of civilians in the area to strike it.  So the latest challenge isn't how to strike groups like ISIS (we are pretty darn good at that), it's figuring out the who, when, and where."
geopolitics,3aysqi,Doncuneo,4,Wed Jun 24 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"A couple of interesting thoughts. One, it must surely cost a lot more to stay ahead (USA) than it does to catch up (China). Two, the American Military Industrial complex is bloated, inefficient and fairly corrupt.  As a result, the US has to spend many times what China (or Russia?) would spend to get the same result.  Is it possible that China's real goal is not to ""catch up"" with the US in terms of Air or Naval power, but to cause the USA to eventually spend itself into bankruptcy? If there's anything that could cause the US to go broke, a never-ending quest for full-spectrum dominance might be it."

Your claim is also not entirely accurate because the U.S. is not spending to get the ""same result"" as China or Russia. The U.S. is spending to innovate new methods of warfare. While those playing catch up can benefit from this spending through observation and information theft, it means that they will never have the first-mover advantage."
geopolitics,3aysqi,UpvoteIfYouDare,6,Wed Jun 24 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"first-mover advantage.   Yes. But at what cost? How much is US spending on a single F35? How many aircraft of similar performance can China build for the same amount?  As for innovating new methods of warfare, I would agree. But I would also suggest that in this age of hacking information and cyberwarfare, the time gap between the innovator and those who play catchup is getting ever narrower.  What's more, the US is no longer the first mover in every technological area. China is currently the sole nation that possesses ASBM technology and they have a slight lead in hyper-glide missile technology.   This is right now. Who knows how much more the balance will change over the next decade or two?"
geopolitics,3aysqi,OB1_kenobi,10,Wed Jun 24 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"How much is US spending on a single F35? How many aircraft of similar performance can China build for the same amount?   The F-35 per-unit costs are high at the moment because it's just getting out of development. As it stays in production it will decrease in cost per unit. The F-35 is already in production whereas China has yet to develop its stealth fighters out of the prototype stage. This means that China still has to incur higher costs to advance its own program whereas the major costs of the F-35 are already in the past. This factor makes it difficult to accurately compare the cost of the two programs side-by-side. Transparency is also a major issue when comparing the two programs.   But I would also suggest that in this age of hacking information and cyberwarfare, the time gap between the innovator and those who play catchup is getting ever narrower.   Holding onto the blueprints is only a small part of development and production. As long as a country is primarily dependent on information theft for its development, it will be perpetually playing catch-up. Information theft produces diminishing returns as that gap closes.   China is currently the sole nation that possesses ASBM technology and they have a slight lead in hyper-glide missile technology.    The U.S. and Russia likely refrained from conventional use of ballistic missiles in order to lower the likelihood of false positives for nuclear attack. Becoming a first-mover in an area that has no competitors does not mean much for overall technological development. In terms of hyper-glide technology, I would want to know what potential competing technologies exist. I would also guess that the general neglect of ballistic missile technology factored into this gap in development, as well."
geopolitics,3aysqi,UpvoteIfYouDare,4,Wed Jun 24 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"The rationale behind hyper-glide (hypersonic cruise missiles) is that they don't fly in a ballistic arc and are therefore not vulnerable to many of the countermeasures that can be applied against ICBMs.  Anyways, I'm not cheering for China or anyone else. I'm just questioning the concept that one side can perpetually stay ahead of another side by means of a technological advantage.   I would suggest that, at some point, this way of doing things will either break down (ie becomes impossible/not feasible to maintain) or some other player will find a way to counter it (asymmetric response)."
geopolitics,3aysqi,OB1_kenobi,5,Wed Jun 24 19:53:15 2015 UTC,Social security and Medicare will pose far greater issues for the U.S. budget than China's military spending ever will.

If so, it's no coincidence that they have recently chosen to act more assertively with the neighboring countries.  All they have to do is avoid an open conflict with the US for another decade or two. Then budgetary constraints will limit the US ability to maintain that first-mover technological lead that they depend on so much."
geopolitics,3aysqi,OB1_kenobi,2,Wed Jun 24 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if China makes itself to be enough of a threat, it could very well provide the political incentive to address Social Security sooner rather than later in order to mitigate potential budgetary issues.

Back in the day the US military could wipe out thousands of Chinese soldiers without breaking a sweat. They could casually threaten China over Taiwan. What they want is to reach the point where if a conflict looks possible, the US will wonder how much are they willing to pay in blood?   We already see the US slowly backing away from it's previous behaviour. Clinton could send the US Navy to warn China to back off. Obama actively works against Taiwanese presidential candidates that are anti-Chinese. The US favours Taiwanese politicians that are pro-Chinese. They don't want to see tensions increase because China won't back down like it did in the '90s.  The long term advantage rests with China. China's economy will surpass the US. There will come a point where China will be able to afford a large military budget simply by spending around 2%. If the US wants to equalise they will have to spend proportionally much much more.

I get it; Cold Wr comparisons with Russia. It's smart to learn from history, but you do see that the American defense budget has shrunk and is not expanding, right? It could expand, but it seems for now that it's stuck where it is and that the US people tend to get really sick of military spending even during wars.

Also, stop conflating someone's nationality with the country as a whole by using ""you"". I am not the U.S. I just live in the U.S., along with 320 million other people. That's not how we engage in discussion in this subreddit.   Weaker as in economic/trade ties with other nations, weaker as in others not following the US as blindly anymore, weaker as in the USD share of global trade etc etc.   The U.S. economy was weaker in 2011 than it currently is and U.S. international trade was lower in all categories back in 2011. I find it strange that you use 2011 as a point of comparison.  Also, there's been little change in ""others not following the US as blindly anymore"" because there's been no static measure of this over time. The U.S. relationship with other countries has fluctuated significantly over the past century. France under Charles de Gaulle was adamantly against NATO, and this was in a period just after a world war that devastated Europe. Plenty of countries also opposed and abstained from the U.S. invasion of Iraq during a period of major U.S. military expansion. Frankly, the claim that countries ""aren't blindly following the U.S. anymore"" completely neglects the history of U.S. international relations.   Face it, at the end you're a big island thousands of miles away from where 'the action' is happening.   What relevance does ""thousands of miles"" have when it takes less time to traverse this distance than it does to traverse the Eurasian continent? You're probably drawing from Mackinder's ""World Island"" theory when you make these statements. Being on a ""big island"" also means that the U.S. does not have to compete with any other regional power, whereas any major power on the Eurasian continent will have to compete with the numerous other powers present. None of these powers can ever overtake all of the others, meaning that they are all locked in a perpetual state of regional power struggle.  Besides, purely from a physics standpoint, shipping is a superior method of transportation and a country that controls two massive coasts and a myriad of islands will have a major advantage in this area.

Indeed the US was digging itself out of the hole back in 2011, and was weaker than it is today. That being said, China has grown a heck of a lot in the past 4 years, as has the rest of Asia. As I later clarified, it's not that the US is becoming that much weaker, but that the rest is becoming that much bigger and more powerful. Like if you keep driving at 60mph, and the Asian countries at 110mph.  Following blindly isn't an official measurement, of course not. But you can see that there is a lot more resistance against US policies, even from old allies like Europe. Take for example how the US didn't want EU countries and Australia etc to join the AIIB. All joined, except Japan.  The relevance of thousands of miles lays in trade relations, and with it, economic and political relations. Two neighbourss will have more relationships than a person living in another village. That's how you can see Korea softening it's stance on China, same with Australia, and later on Japan. The US may want to keep those hostilities alive, but economic realities are more important and supersede those hostilities. Mackinder isn't a theory, it's merely common sense. A large part of Europe's integration is based on geography, not language, race, culture. It's sheer geography and with it, sheer economic ties. Indeed the US has no competition, and has the luxury of having small neighbours. The other side of the coin is that the US has no close proximity to where the 'action is'. That means it has to resort to underscoring differences between people in Eurasia, and to incite hatred and drive wedges between them, in order to keep it's relevance. Not saying the US does this, but it's the only option.

geopolitics,3aw2pc,IR-TR,3,Wed Jun 24 05:01:40 2015 UTC,"A vast amount of the world's internet infrastructure is located in the U.S. and a majority of the world's information flows through the country. This is the reason the U.S. gets the largest voice in deciding the rules for the internet. Population is not nearly as relevant in this situation as technology and knowledge economy is.  Furthermore, I don't see China being able to influence rules for the internet until the GFW is done away with. It is a major impediment toward the country's development in information technology and as long as it is in place it will prevent them from ever being a global IT player."

Because the U.S. creates the protocols, produces the most advanced semiconductor technology, and leads the world in information technology by a large margin? It could also be due to the much higher efficiency of laying cables across the ocean versus laying them overland. What actual relevance does ""being the largest landmass in the world"" have when it comes to information technology? You seem to exclusively rely on population numbers and geographic size to justify your statements and yet you fail to demonstrate the connection they have to actual developments in information technology. Geographic size is actually disadvantageous when it comes to establishing computer networks and population size is, at best, tangentially related to development whereas education and an existing knowledge economy have a much more significant effect."

I don't think you have any idea how idiotic the Great Firewall is from a technological standpoint. Not only does it impede efficient flow of information, it is a direct an impediment to development and integration of regional computer networks, which means that as long as China keeps it running, it will always be at a severe advantage when it comes to information technology. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about this. Not only that, but China has demonstrated that it's willing to use the GFW in an offensive manner against sites in other countries when it brought down GitHub for five days. That kind of behavior will piss off developers far more than NSA surveillance ever did.  Also, in a hypothetical situation where infrastructure is located in China, I guarantee you that the CCP would be far more brazen about its violation of privacy and information gathering than the NSA has ever been.  Finally, ""far away"" means very little when it comes to information technology. The only real issue that the U.S.'s distance poses is to latency, and only a few applications are significantly affected by latency issues. For a majority of consumers, these latency issues do not affect them in the slightest.

geopolitics,3auze4,ThatThrowa-wayThough,2,Tue Jun 23 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"Dr. Bacevich raises the very important issue of how ISIS originated (American involvement destabilizing Iraq), and how disconcerting the Washington consensus narrative is, but I'm not seeing him offer any viable alternatives or a way forward.  The up-armored humvees were a necessity for the occupation of Iraq due to the insurgency's use of IEDs.  Was there evidence that the Iraqi army lacked resolve?  If it's fair to extrapolate based on a high school friend's experience training the Afghan National Army, quite likely.  That said, what's the alternative?  ISIS already has thousands of humvees, which are being used, and a number of M1 Abrams tanks, which to the extent of my knowledge have not been used.  The Iraqi army needs to be able to take out these vehicles.  What I want to know, and lack the expertise to determine, is the relative usefulness of these weapons.  If they were to fall into ISIS's hands, would it meaningfully improve their capabilities?  They've taken out a number of the Iraqi army's Abrams tanks, which are better than anything used by Syria, but probably have inferior crews.  Zinni is oversimplifying things to say we had a clear victory in the Desert Shield/Storm because we used overwhelming force.  We had a much more reserved mission than in the invasion of Iraq.  Really, Flournoy hit the nail on the head with regards to the Iraqis.  The country has structural problems.  It doesn't have a strong sense of national unity; people are motivated primarily along family/tribal/ethnic lines.  Maliki never bothered trying to involve the Sunnis, and exacerbated sectarian issues.  Unless these fundamental problems are addressed, Iraq's ability to unify is hampered and future dim.  Balkanizing the country into three states might be a good thing.  American intervention on the ground would be a mistake in that it would play into ISIS's narrative, and in my opinion, bolster recruitment and inspire terrorist attacks.  Ultimately, I think they need to be confronted by a coalition of both Sunni and Shia Muslims, but there are challenges to this in the never-ending pissing match between the Saudis and Iranians vying for influence in the region.  Iran would have made a much better regional ally than Saudi Arabia due to its relative liberalism, but we shot ourselves in the face rather than the foot when we put the Shah in power on behalf of British Petroleum.  Instead, we aligned with a country that exports Wahhabi Islam to the region, which is decidedly detrimental to our interests and the region's development by encouraging conflict due to its takfiri beliefs.  At the end of the day, I feel like this article boils down to, ""this is our fault for taking out Saddam and destabilizing Iraq,"" which is true, and while it is also true that it is somewhat absurd to be destroying American equipment with American weapons, I'm not seeing the alternative.  Do we not support the Iraqi army and accelerate its descent into a failed state?  I don't see how that fits our interests or those of the Iraqi people."

geopolitics,3atzka,must_warn_others,3,Wed Jun 24 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"Today Europe isn't a continent of borders but the worlds most loosely connected federal state. The EU has government institutions; European Parliament, European Commission, European Central Bank, The Court of Justice of the European Union and more. Every EU citizen can travel freely, work and get social services in other countries. And the capitals of Europe filled with citizen from all over Europe who are either working or on holiday. Borders?  An structural issue could be that national politicians are elected to serve only their national interest, not necessary take the whole of Europe into account. There are many more.  The immigration issue is more about numbers than religion. People look at the demographics, fertility levels and unemployment levels of many African states and fear high amounts of continuous immigration for years to come. ""The immigrant story"" in Europe is, unlike the one in US, one where many end up living in ghettos and on welfare, unfortunately.  Europe's external borders are managed by Fortex and have recently received more funding. Besides that I believe the multiple countries are helping out in the Mediterranean.  The main problem by far is the economy. Over-leveraged banks, monetary union (Euro) and over-regulated economies. This is the discussion in EU and also the essential issue for many protest movements. If you fix this issue others will disappear.  I acknowledge that borders still is a topic in some circles but it isn't a central mainstream issue.

geopolitics,3atzka,kapom,8,Tue Jun 23 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're glossing over the solubility of three points he makes.   First, the fact of the matter is that individual nations still elect politicians who favor their national interest. Until this changes, or until the Nation state has less power under the EU, it's going to be a problem. There are massive foreign and domestic political policy differences between North and South, East and West, and between individual countries. EU institutions have so far been used mainly as tools by individual powers at different times, particularly by the Germans.   Second are the demographics of Europe, particularly Western Europe. They have negative birth rates, and if they reject immigrants they're just going to end up like Japan, with zero economic growth and an aging population.   Third, ""fixing the economy"" is not going to be easy. They need to build up unified fiscal institutions governing the entire EU before they can fix their problems, perhaps a true political union as well. The Germans would have to agree to wealth transfers to the rest of the continent, and the rest of the continent would have to deal with not having control of their own state welfare and pension systems which would have to be governed by an EU wide system.   Europe is simply not ready to be united yet. I certainly wouldn't call it a ""loosely connected federal state"", considering that it lacks all but the most basic political institutions and basically no mechanism for fiscal transfers between its constituent parts."

geopolitics,3auguf,lingben,2,Tue Jun 23 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"in case you hit the NYT paywall:  PRESIDENT OBAMA’S main pitch for the pending nuclear deal with Iran is that it would extend the “breakout time” necessary for Iran to produce enough enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. In a recent interview with NPR, he said that the current breakout time is “about two to three months by our intelligence estimates.” By contrast, he claimed, the pending deal would shrink Iran’s nuclear program, so that if Iran later “decided to break the deal, kick out all the inspectors, break the seals and go for a bomb, we’d have over a year to respond.”  Unfortunately, that claim is false, as can be demonstrated with basic science and math. By my calculations, Iran’s actual breakout time under the deal would be approximately three months — not over a year. Thus, the deal would be unlikely to improve the world’s ability to react to a sudden effort by Iran to build a bomb.  Breakout time is determined by three primary factors: the number and type of centrifuges; the enrichment of the starting material; and the amount of enriched uranium required for a nuclear weapon. Mr. Obama seems to make rosy assumptions about all three.  Most important, in the event of an overt attempt by Iran to build a bomb, Mr. Obama’s argument assumes that Iran would employ only the 5,060 centrifuges that the deal would allow for uranium enrichment, not the roughly 14,000 additional centrifuges that Iran would be permitted to keep mainly for spare parts. Such an assumption is laughable. In a real-world breakout, Iran would race, not crawl, to the bomb.  These additional centrifuges would need to be connected, brought up to speed and equilibrated with the already operating ones. But at that point, Iran’s enrichment capacity could exceed three times what Mr. Obama assumes. This flaw could be addressed by amending the deal to require Iran to destroy or export the additional centrifuges, but Iran refuses.  Second, since the deal would permit Iran to keep only a small amount of enriched uranium in the gaseous form used in centrifuges, Mr. Obama assumes that a dash for the bomb would start mainly from unenriched uranium, thereby lengthening the breakout time. But the deal would appear to also permit Iran to keep large amounts of enriched uranium in solid form (as opposed to gas), which could be reconverted to gas within weeks, thus providing a substantial head-start to producing weapons-grade uranium.  Third, Mr. Obama’s argument assumes that Iran would require 59 pounds of weapons-grade uranium to make an atomic bomb. In reality, nuclear weapons can be made from much smaller amounts of uranium (as experts assume North Korea does in its rudimentary arsenal). A 1995 study by the Natural Resources Defense Council concluded that even a “low technical capability” nuclear weapon could produce an explosion with a force approaching that of the Hiroshima bomb — using just 29 pounds of weapons-grade uranium.  Based on such realistic assumptions, Iran’s breakout time under the pending deal actually would be around three months, while its current breakout time is a little under two months. Thus, the deal would increase the breakout time by just over a month, too little to matter. Mr. Obama’s main argument for the agreement — extending Iran’s breakout time — turns out to be effectively worthless.  By contrast, Iran stands to gain enormously. The deal would lift nuclear-related sanctions, thereby infusing Iran’s economy with billions of dollars annually. In addition, the deal could release frozen Iranian assets, reportedly giving Tehran a $30 billion to $50 billion “signing bonus.”  Showering Iran with rewards for making illusory concessions poses grave risks. It would entrench the ruling mullahs, who could claim credit for Iran’s economic resurgence. The extra resources would also enable Iran to amplify the havoc it is fostering in neighboring countries like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.  Worst of all, lifting sanctions would facilitate a huge expansion of Iran’s nuclear program. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, says that he wants 190,000 centrifuges eventually, or 10 times the current amount, as would appear to be permissible under the deal after just 10 years. Such enormous enrichment capacity would shrink the breakout time to mere days, so that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb before we even knew it was trying — thus eliminating any hope of our taking preventive action.  Nothing in the pending deal is worth such risks. Unless President Obama can extract significantly greater concessions at the negotiating table, Congress should refuse to lift sanctions, thereby blocking implementation of a deal that would provide Iran billions of dollars to pursue nuclear weapons and regional hegemony.  Alan J. Kuperman is an associate professor and the coordinator of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project at the University of Texas at Austin."

geopolitics,3auzgi,Keran1986,2,Tue Jun 23 18:47:58 2015 UTC,Anything is possible but I don't think this scenario is likely. When you say a simultaneous land/sea grab I assume you mean a coordination between Russia and China to move at the same time which would necessitate prior consultation and movement of troops and equipment all of which can be detected. For Russia I assume you mean either a push to take all of eastern Ukraine or an attack on the Baltics. For China it is more problematic. They already have a good position in the South China Sea so in a way that is already acquired. Attacking Vietnam or the Philippines is a no go. It is too risky. I am sure they would love to own Taiwan but to attack it would require months of preparation and easily detected. That leaves the Senkaku Islands. Unfortunately for China if they invaded them then Japan would defend and the Japanese navy and army are not pushovers. Japan's armed forces are top of the line and highly motivated. All of China's potential targets are either over lots of water or over mountains. So where would China attack that has a decent risk-reward ratio? I don't see where. Another thing is if the Russian armed forces would be busy in Europe then their Far Eastern forces would be down drawn and less able to defend that part of Russia. I doubt if there is a deep trust between Russia and China. In my opinion Russia is too worried about being betrayed by China to coordinate a simultaneous attack. The Chinese leadership is not prone to rash adventures that have a low reward ratio. They are doing nicely as it is and gaining in power as time goes by. Russia on the other hand desperately needs China but China doesn't need Russia so why would China follow Russia's lead? Nevertheless China is using Russia in an intelligent way by obtaining oil at bargain rates and even leasing large swaths of land in Siberia and demanding the land be worked by imported Chinese labor and not by Russians.

Otherwise, Japan would put in place radar/sonar capabilities on them, and China would be 100% contained in the East China Sea. By simply contesting it they gain some wiggle room.   [Russia] moving further into Ukraine or taking Transnistria.   Regarding Russia making a push East, Ukraine mobilized too many troops and the West imposed to high of a cost for that. Russia can't afford the economic and political fallout, their GDP has already shrunk 3.8% this year!   Russia is also in the midst of a military modernization program. Any capital expended on keeping a front active (cough East Ukraine cough) is less on arms development and procurement. Also capturing territory isn't hard per sey. It's making sure you can defend it and the local populace accepts you that's difficult. On both counts Crimea worked out marvelously in favor of Russia. That's not the case for any strip of land that's closure to the Dnieper than to Russia."

Moving up the rung to domestically manufacture more profitable and sophisticated products has always been the goal for every single country following the heavy-investment rapid industrialisation model.

For example,  the UK is now a finance powerhouse instead of a mining and manufacturing country.  The USA has made up for losses in manufacturing with gains in Information-Technology and R&D. Simply put, the countries which are losing their manufacturing base can capitalize on it by financing the projects that are growing in other countries or by contributing other parts of the project such as R&D. There is also the possibility of switching to manufacturing complex products such as MRI machines or other medical technology that can't be produced with cheap labour; this is the successful path that Ireland's economy took.  Taiwan should prepare for a future where it is no longer competitive in manufacturing. It does not make sense to oppose China's  rise because Taiwanese consumers can benefit from the lower prices of Chinese produced goods.  Instead, Taiwan should promote diversification into other high-tech sectors (R&D,  biotechnology,  IT) that suit Taiwan's educated workforce."

Whatever Russians think of the country’s economic malaise – GDP is expected to contract by 3.8% this year, while inflation could top 15% – they are assured that they would be much worse off without Putin.  And Russians have fallen into line. A few years ago, it seemed that every tenth person wore a white ribbon, a symbol of protest against Putin. Today, one gets the impression that every third Russian is wearing the Ribbon of Saint George, an orange and black symbol of patriotism and loyalty to the Kremlin. Those who do not wear the ribbon can expect to be asked – and not very politely – why they choose not to.  It is an insidious and effective strategy, one that marginalizes dissenters and generates the impression of near-universal support for the regime."""

geopolitics,3apnbc,aeiresearch,2,Tue Jun 23 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"To keep it short, I ended up where I am by chance. When I first went to university, I had no idea as to what I wanted to do. I joined a small college at a large university. I was talking to the Dean and told him I had no idea what I wanted to do as I was undeclared. However, I did have an interest in studying a foreign language and so he called up a friend of his in the Arabic department. Within five minutes, I was meeting with the department head and was signed up for beginners Arabic.   Following through with that, I declared middle eastern studies and history with an Arabic minor. However, despite loving history, I found that I didn't see my future in it. I saw more importance in the here and now than in the past even though it is just as important. And seeing as my university's MES department was more focused on culture, I started branching out on my own. Doing my own research, proactively looking for opportunities to discuss international affairs (the international relations degree at my uni was kinda shit), and looking for chances to get away from college and head off to the policy world.   And I did just that. I ended up in an internship and thoroughly enjoyed it. Going into a little more depth, I enjoyed the work I did, but I hated the environment. But that's to be expected of public policy internships everywhere. Interns aren't paid, neither are the researchers (well at least), but the experience is invaluable because it gives you real world experience into the field you are jumping into.   As for narrowing your area of interest, the only advice I can give you is to take a shot at everything. You are going to be a first year at a university. It's a chance to redefine who you are and to explore what's next. I wouldn't put too much importance on finding our what you want to do for the rest of your life in the four years that you are at college. However, even though I said that, college gives you the chance to explore those options with little regret. So take a Chance and jump into it. Take a new language (chines, dari, russian, etc), find classes that interest you, meet professors that can give you fantastic insight, consider all opportunities that come at you, and I swear if you are proactively looking for it, you will find what you want to do. That's what I did, but don't leave it all to chance. Go and get it."

geopolitics,3anora,nickottens,3,Mon Jun 22 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Most people looking at this problem with wrong scales. The problem caused by Greece isn't a problem because they can't pay the debts. The main problem is the trust into the EU and the relationship into the finance institutions of Greece. All the loans given to Greece had mostly the purpose to pay for old loans, which piled up the debts of Greece. Indeed every state does it, but some get better conditions like Germany or the US. It's much cheaper for them. Because Greece wasn't trusted longer, the EU had to give new loans to expensive conditions. Germany makes profits  on paper!   Usually people calling this is a fraud or corruption, but it has a real political  purpose. Since banks in the EU gave loans to Greece and banks, they had to be saved. This came at a price. To avoid a too bad reputation of the ECB some loans were given by EU members.   The (new) government of Greece wants to solve the problem. But there is nothing to solve. Because of austerity small to middle companies went bankrupt a lot and Greece couldn't even pay the interest at the start of the crisis. The taxation of the citizens is now one of the highest in Europe. In addition the EU wanted actions like firing officials which are hunting tax evaders. A half million people living without a home in the streets of Athens.   To me it's clear, the goal of the EU was always to dump Greece later, to save the EU as a place for finance. It went wrong. In the first place the former parties of conservatives and socialdemocrats  were corrupt as hell with citizens which adapted to corruption. But nobody changes attitudes over night.  Spain and Portugal isn't in a much better condition than Greece and Italy had it's first hiccups for a long time ago.   The Balkan nations are in a state of the past, by maintaining a sort of nationalism which is nothing else than terrorism on their economy, by having small regions with different laws. When the EU preferred a destabilization of Yugoslavia  instead of a multicultural political order, a strong development of the region was prevented and is now a liability of the EU.   For the German government just one thing is important to get a solution to support the EU market for the exports of Germany. I would take a look at the french unemployment rates too. Europe is going to be explosive. But even when the EU is going down financially, there is no alternative. The UK pretends to have alternatives, but the world markets are already distributed. The latter is the reason why I'm believing this problem will last long."

I am guessing that if Ukraine starts getting arms from Lithuania, Poland or any other nation that will tip the scale towards UA army then Russia will not sit idle. It's closely resembles Austria exercising power towards Serbia in pre-WWI. While Donbass is Ukrainian territory, they get support from Russia. I just feel like Russia won't let this one go, they will steam roll through UA army and occupy Donbass because it's more important to them than Serbs were 100 years ago. Now what is the point?

The sanctions placed on Russia last year were not placed on their entire economy, but rather targeted specific individuals in Putin's inner circle along with others in important government positions and major Russian businesses. I doubt what you described above was the case with these sanctions.  Ultimately, there is little chance of even major sanctions regimes of ""destabilizing"" a country that is not deeply connected to Western markets.

OBL was one of many sponsors of Mujahideen, a list of which included the USA through the ISI as well as many other Wahhabist groups that were raising funding through the Islamic world to fund resistance against the Soviets and the Soviet-friendly Afghani government.  OBL brought a lot of money with him to Afghanistan and used it to fund and help Mujahideen fighters.  He was not synonomous with the Muj, he wasn't even part of them.  Funding the Muj certainly wasn't the same thing as funding OBL.    From Steve Coll's Ghost Wars:   There was one other small blip on the Counterterrorist Center’s screen. From Pakistan arrived reports of a new group called the Islamic Salvation Foundation that had been formed in Peshawar to recruit and support Arab volunteers for the Afghan jihad, outside the control of any of the ISI-backed rebel parties. The network was operating offices and guesthouses along the Afghan frontier. Osama bin Laden, a wealthy young Saudi, was spreading large sums of money around Peshawar to help the new center expand. He was tapping into ISI’s guerrilla training camps on behalf of newly arrived Arab jihadists. The early reports of his activity that were passed along to the CIA’s Counterterrorist Center in this period suggested that bin Laden “certainly was not engaged in any fighting. He was not a warrior,” recalled Stanley Bedington, a senior analyst at the center from its beginning. Still, “ When a man starts throwing around money like that, he comes to your notice.”   As a side note, if you're going to sarcastically tell someone that a topic is ""seriously one of the easiest googles in the world"", it's best to either double-check your information first, or just phrase it more politely to begin with."

A stance that if Iran even acknowledges would indite them and their nuclear program, immensely strengthening the P5+1 negotion hand.   Both parties know this, but to play it out should Iran have even entered negotiations on those terms; the P5+1's ability to now leverage--should the deal fall through--the admission with (now legitimate) military threats means Iran has essentially folded their negotiation's hand. With that admission it would mean the P5+1 / all relevant international agencies would demand access to all military facilities as parts for the nuclear program 'could' (read: are) likely scattered. It would also subjugate Iran in a way it would never tolerate.

This group’s paper, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, suggested that efforts should 'focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq – an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right – as a means of foiling Syria’s regional ambitions.' ""  My question:  How was removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq supposed to foil Syria’s regional ambitions? Removing Saddam seems to have increased Iran's influence in Iraq, and Iran supports Syria's Assad."
geopolitics,3ak256,CudiKush,4,Sat Jun 20 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"Both were Baathist and avowedly anti-Israel. While Iraq was Sunni dominated with Saddam in power it was somewhat of a paariah amongst the other Sunni nations which had entered into a de facto thaw of relations with Israel. Iraq under Saddam also had the highest propensity to directly attack Israel as seen by his use of SCUD missiles during the Gulf War.  I agree with your overall conclusion though, removing Saddam from power has definitely greatly increased Iranian influence within Iraq."
geopolitics,3ak256,FoolEskimo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:32:50 2015 UTC,"I too am a little baffled by the quote.  Its somewhat before my time, but your best bet is to look into Syrian-Iraqi relations during the mid to late nineties. Syria and Iraq had been rivals since the seventies as a result of the split in the Ba'ath Party, and Syria did back Iran during the Iran-Iraq War, but the Gulf War resulted in Iraq losing the backing of the United States, so there may have been a shift in Syrian-Iraqi relations during the years between the Gulf War and the War in Iraq.  I don't know much about Syrian-Iraqi relations during that period but it would not be out of the question.  Syria was firmly in control of Lebanon during that time, and Iraq was in a very much weakened state and potentially open to increased Syrian influence.  It was Syrias backing of Iran during the Iran-Iraq War that underpins the relationship between Syria and Iran. Syria has for decades been a major regional player in the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Lebanese Civil War, and Pan-Arabist movement, and is influential in its own right.  Removing Saddam from power was meant to turn Iraq into a US aligned liberal democracy. It was not part of the US plan for Iraq to descend into sectarian violence, civil war, Shia domination, and ultimately an Iranian ally."

Ironically, this is exactly what Russia wants for Ukraine and similar countries it considers 'buffers' along its border.  The truth is closer to this: sovereign nations decide to join NATO for many reasons, but it is primarily because they seek a defensive posture in reaction to Russian belligerence.  Russia is upset that after they invaded Ukraine, another sovereign nation and broke the Budapest Memorandum, that neighboring nations would be wondering if they are next and desire to increase their defensive position.

Here's an excerpt that sums up the situation quite nicely:  ""Western support for protests and revolts presented a threat to Russian interests. The accusations towards Putin of aggressive behaviour might be true, but let’s not forget the Euro-Atlantic coalition is not a stranger to that. The Russians have been clear in their Irredentist ambitions and for almost two decades are protesting NATO’s enlargement policies. The current crisis coalesces with a wider international development: After many centuries the western dominance and its grip on world affairs is declining. The international system and organisations founded after World War II are losing its consensual status, partly because western democracies abused the system. There is a growing group of nations and non-state actors, some of them allied with Russia, that have a an interest in breaking down the international system through which western dominance is projected. If the West is not able to recognize the changing world order and, as a result, the crumbling international structures, the coming decades are going to be very sobering."""

geopolitics,3ag92z,Sisyphos89,3,Sat Jun 20 10:06:12 2015 UTC,"Short History: Britain actually aided in the creation of Saudi Arabia. After the division of the ottoman empire the pro-British arab states of Hejaz, Transjordan, and Iraq were all ruled by Hashemite brothers, who played with the idea of unification, under a Mecca-ruled ""nationalist caliphate"". Britain didn't like this concept, so aided Ibn Saud in conquering the Kingdom of Hejaz, and Mecca, ending the possibility of another caliphate.  At the time Wahabis didn't seem any different from the Sunnis in British eyes. The Saudis also supported British claims in the region, in return for their past help.  Nowadays the USA lets the Saudis exist because they are the largest oil exporter and weapon importer in the world (they need weapons because they fear the stronger army of Iran) While the USA is the largest weapon exporter and oil importer. A match made in heaven, despite both countries finding each other ideologically repugnant,"

But the reality is that those days are largely over. Most change which the west encourages or supports nowadays is soft change - rhetoric, economic policy, international consensus...and they only go beyond that when they feel they have to.   It's true that much of the Saudi-U.S. relationship seems to be one of mutual convenience, but I don't think it's a toggle that goes from alliance to enemy. Without the strategic value, it would probably be more like how the U.S. views Pakistan, or Vietnam - namely, they'd probably be openly critical and intolerant of the human rights violations, but would largely ignore them unless they had some other immutable strategic interest they were forced to deal with.  It's not a glowing definition of western motivation in geopolitics, and certainly the mindsets and language which precipitated the Iraq war are glaring exceptions, but I think you'll find it's largely the view in the west that war is an issue of existential self-interest and necessity only."

It would be like the Iraq occupation, except even more expensive, with stronger and more widespread insurgency, and lasting decades.

geopolitics,3ag92z,UpvoteIfYouDare,2,Sat Jun 20 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what time you are talking about. Directly after world war 2, you had a consensus that there would be no more imperial nations. Former Imperial nations agreed to disband their former colonies. Many countries, believed that this act would help to deescalate conflict in the future.   Perhaps directly after WW2 the Western nations could have taken over the middle east. How ever it most likely would have been done through a bloody insurgency. It's also noteworthy to wonder if countries were aware how much oil was to be valued in the future. This was before the time of King Hammond's peak oil theory.   After World War 2, came the cold war, and threats of mutual total destruction from nuclear weapons. This does not mean the strategic implications of the middle east lessened.  The State Department, in 1945, described as ""a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history"" (referring specifically to Saudi Arabia, but the intent is more general) (Noam Chomsky).   Through the Cold war our relations varied. England, Russian and the United States were heavily involved in diplomatic relationship building. The Western countries saw Iran and the Shia population as the most likely partner. This had partly to do with Iran being more pro-western, and had similar cultural ties. (You would be surprised how much this holds true today, despite what heads of diplomats of both countries say. Iran is fascinating!) Anyways, I believe Iran had also more known deposits of Oil, and that Saudi Arabia was yet to fully discover the wealth that lay under their country.  I cant think of specific examples, but President Truman had interesting takes on how to approach these situations unlike, many politicians.   Anyways, when Iran's Shah decided he wanted Iran to break away from providing England's Middle East Oil Country (Forgetting name) with the lucrative deal they agreed upon. The Shah wanted to divert more of the economic benefits to his own country. This isnt necessarily clear cut as a righteous solution. The U.K. had heavily invested in the infrastructure of the country and it's oil refineries.  Thus, you see the conditions for why the United States and the U.k. feel the justification for the coup.   Anyways, history happens, and again in 1980 with the carter doctrine established the foothold for future strategic operations. The carter doctrine gave the United States, the right to pursue it's strategic assets for their security in the middle east.   In the 90's this could be arguably why they entered the Gulf War. Also they had U.N. approval. There were proponents like Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz who believed we should have broke U.N. law and invaded Iraq after expelling Sadam from Kuwait. This belief for war would later carry over when the three individuals would become part of Bush's war cabinet during his presidency.   TLDR: The western countries tried to an extent, but occupation went against both internal and external beliefs. What came from it was a series of diplomatic relationships for security."

It's a lie. People in power react to events like 9/11.

geopolitics,3ag92z,ghosttrainhobo,3,Sat Jun 20 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, nobody is in control. However, there is extensive literature and theories on how nation states interact in the international system. These theories give different values and attributes to different levels of a nation state. Some theorists, believe that nation-states are coalesced at the sub-state and individual levels. IE, nation leader's and Sub-State actors like different representative social bodies.   Realists, and neo-realists like Kenneth Waltz believe that nation-states are guided by rational thought given to the need for survival in anarchical international system. For Waltz, nation-states inn-act force when threatened or perceive rational gains to better their position against adversaries.   Cashman and Robinson on causes of war detail other governing systems like cartelized governments. Which I think OP is referring to, with a hint of neo-liberalism tucked in with his belief in US financial support.   I dont disagree with OP that states are capable of thinking ahead with grand strategies that may create conditions that he is referring to. However, OP's argument lacks any real identifiable material that this is actually happening, and the foundation of strategy from which he is arguing is faulty.  For example, why would the United States look to destabilise Saudi Arabia later on? Saudi Arabia provides a stable state capable of exporting their vast resources which in turn helps stabilise global trade.  I cant see the benefits of disrupting this, any I shutter to think of what would happen to the world if these energy resources in the middle east were in jeopardy.   I think this is partly why the United States entered the war in 1991, when Iraq threatened Kuwaiti and Saudi Oil lines."

If the Iranian government were really so antagonistic to the Islamic State, however, then perhaps in the years before the United States became involved in an air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, then Tehran would have had its client, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, use his air force to bomb the Islamic State’s headquarters in Raqqa rather than use his then-uncontested control of the skies to drop barrel bombs on civilians. Even if Iranian leaders have come to recognize the threat the Islamic State poses, they are not an altruistic power. It is the Qods Force—and not ordinary Iraqi volunteers joining the fight against the Islamic State—that promulgate corrosive sectarianism. It should be the goal of the United States to ensure Iraqi sovereignty and defeat all extremism, not simply swap one flavor for another.   This is absurd. Know who else isn't an ""altruistic power""? The United States, alongside all other powers that exist, have existed and will exists.  I don't think it's fair to call Iran ""extremist"".

If I had to pick an analogue to the ""missile gap"" rhetoric from the 50s and 60s, I would choose the rhetoric surrounding ASBMs and their effectiveness against carrier groups.

Kiev is holding almost every line, barring a few infringements on rights that Europeans pale at (and, of course, the frontline); the US and EU, whilst being broadly on the same side (though noises from Greece, Italy, Hungary et al. threaten even this), are at loggerheads over arming Ukraine—it's certainly not a sign of unity when they need it most; finally, while Russia is most certainly faced with a hostile frontier, it gets increasingly less hostile the further West one goes. Again, the lock-step between the US, the Baltics, and not many others is a bit of an issue, and certainly a weakness brought to the fore by the Ukraine crisis.   I still think this is a net win for the West, and I think Russia has always known this. It's one issue I'm happy to take the Russian view on: whatever we might think and say, Russia considers itself the wounded party, sincerely, I think. Crimea, in that sense, was a salvage mission (though with slightly different objectives than Donbas). Hybrid war (etc.) is, however, making this win costly. That, in addition with trying to solidify a new, post-Crimea, post-Yanukovych, status quo is what Russia is ultimately aiming for in Ukraine, I think.

geopolitics,3acf5i,ujorge,7,Fri Jun 19 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"No. Yes, Haiti occupied the eastern side of the island (what's now the Dominican Republic) for 22 years.  But it was not an invasion like the German invasion of Poland in World War II, but mostly a political union that was welcomed by an important segment of the population.  Yes, it turned into a military occupation with some good things (the abolition of slavery) and bad things (persecution of the church, anti-white policies, closing of the university, etc)... but military people are usually not good at governing.  But instead of an occupation you can see it as a relationship that didn't work out.  Once the Dominican Republic in 1844, the Haitian forces in Santo Domingo were ask to leave.. and they mostly did, with only a few making an effort to resist.  They real fighting started when those forces arrived in Port-au-Prince and Haitian president Hérard kind of said ""WTF do you mean they kicked you out?"" and invaded with a force of 20,000 soldiers.    The fighting lasted until 1856, but five years later Dominican dictator Pedro Santana betrayed the young nation and invited the Spaniards in.  Dominican patriots fought the Spaniards starting in 1863 with the help of Haiti, which realized that it was better to have the Dominican Republic on the eastern side of the island than an european power that might invade and impose slavery.  That war ended in 1865 when the Spaniards were defeated; one of the heroes of that war was Ulises Heureaux, a black man who's father was Haitian and who became president on 1882.   If you want to know more, Wikipedia is a good source, but check the local library and see if you find The Dominican Republic: A National History.  What I'm trying to tell you is that yet, there is tension between both countries; Dominicans are fearful that mass, uncontrolled immigration from Haiti will destroy the environment just as they had on their side of the island.  Poor Dominicans are unable to find work, among a long construction boom most of the work is done by Haitian laborers while the authorities look the other way.  But saying that's because of an occupation that ended in 1844 is misguided."
geopolitics,3acf5i,StanleyPowerlock,-1,Fri Jun 19 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"I am saying the general current of hate stems from that era, not every problem is s direct result."
geopolitics,3acf5i,ujorge,5,Fri Jun 19 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"And I'm telling you that there is not ""general current of hate""; most of the tension is a media sensationalism.   Yes, there are problems, but on the whole the Dominican Republic is home to over a million Haitians or Dominicans of Haitians descent.  Let me put it this way.  Let's round the number of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent to 1,000,000 and let's assume for the sake of argument that the media is telling the truth and the Dominican government is set to kick out of the country 250,000.  That means that 750,000 will remain in a country of close to 10,000,000 people.    So what do all these 750,000 do day to day?  The same thing you and I do day to day.  Work, eat, study, have fun... you know...live. Yes, a lot of them struggle... just like a lot of poor Dominicans.  If you go to a government run soup kitchen at noon you will find poor Haitians and Dominicans eating side by side.  If you go to a public hospitals you will find poor Dominicans and Haitians receiving attention.  The Dominican government event takes care of actual Haitian women who cross the border in labor to use our hospitals...free of charge.  I'll bet my head on a platter that you didn't know that...read here if you'd like to know more about that.  Haitians kids are educated in our schools, even those that are undocumented and don't have a birth certificate that indicate that they are of school age.  If you read Spanish you'll learn that 12,000 Haitians study in Dominican universities at a cost of $US 120,000,000.  Much of that money is paid by the students, their families or some humanitarians organizations.  Does that sounds to you like a ""current of hate""?  Would you send your kids to study in a country that according to mainstream media hates your guts?  Or do you agree that if Haitians parents feel safe to send their kids across the border to study in Dominican Universities is because they know they will be safe?  Please, don't think I'm upset with you or anything; if I knew you in person I'd be happy to talk about these topics over beer or playing pool.  I'm angry at the media, that having the resources to send people over there to gather the facts choose the lazy approach;  the New York times is covering this issue from their Mexico City Bureau.   I get it, who wants to got to a poor Caribbean country that is hot as hell, go to a poor hospital or school and talk to the people when you can just get on the phone from the confines of your really nice offices in Mexico City?.  I hope I'm not boring you...thanks for putting up with me..."

geopolitics,3a9j68,1337Bolshevik,12,Thu Jun 18 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"Alfred McCoy's articles are far too contingent on Heartland Theory; he seems to harp on it in nearly every one of his geopolitical articles. Mackinder formed his theory in the late 19th century, when European powers had no equals across the entire planet. The ""Great Game"" at this point was taking place between the European powers and at the time, it would seem like the winner of this ""Great Game"" would be able to exert control over a majority of the Eurasian continent simply by virtue of there being no powers able to resist a potential European hegemon other than other European countries. Heartland theory was still somewhat relevant during the Cold War when the only two major powers on the planet were the USSR and the U.S. which is why it was advocated by strategists like Brzezinski. That theory is now thoroughly outdated in a world where Europe, Russia, India, and China all vie for influence throughout the entire Eurasian continent. The Middle East is already unattainable for any ""empire"" at this point, as it will likely remained locked in a power struggle between Iran and the Gulf states for the foreseeable future.  There is no portion of the Eurasian continent not occupied by a major power or influenced by one or more major powers. Central Asia? Russia and China. Eastern Europe? Russia, Europe, and the U.S. Southern Europe? Europe and Russia. Middle East? The U.S., Russia, China, and an internal regional struggle between Iran and the Gulf states. Southeast Asia? China, the U.S., India, and Russia (to some extent with Vietnam). South Asia? India and China. Yes, I realize that treating ""Europe"" as a singular power is not entirely accurate, but I feel that at least Germany and France's interests have aligned enough to treat them as such.  He mentions pipelines and railroads as a modern realization of the ""empire of the world"", but, ignoring the clear disadvantages of over-land travel to sea travel, these two elements alone mean little for establishing a legitimate ""empire of the world"", especially considering how easily they can be disrupted or controlled by local powers. The only way to preempt such control would be to maintain a massive overland military force, one that would be dependent on the very same infrastructure it is tasked with safeguarding. While China has massive manpower reserves, their country historically and culturally is not inclined toward imperialistic ambitions beyond the footprint of historical China. Furthermore, a massive mobilization would likely only be feasible for a specific military goal, such as invading Taiwan, while stationing millions of Chinese troops throughout Eurasia for a decade or more would invoke the ire of the Chinese populace. Finally, China has historically been able to maintain its regional empire due to the relative ethnic homogeneity of the people in its territories. This advantage would quickly be lost beyond the borders of modern China.  There can be no ""empire of the world"" on the ""world island"" as long as a multipolar power configuration dominates that island. The only way this will change is through a major war, which would likely precipitate the annihilation of all involved rather than lead to any one hegemon emerging.  On another (off-topic) note, some of Alfred McCoy's assumptions in his articles are downright insulting or laughably out of touch. I was reading an article of his from 2010 where he talks about China having a global telecommunications network by 2020 powered by ""the fastest supercomputers in the world"". Currently 6 of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world are located in the United States, and they were built after 2010. Of the entire TOP500, 231 were located in the U.S. while only 61 are located in China in November of 2014.  Granted, China only had 10 seven years earlier and had 41 by November of 2010 (which likely influenced McCoy's prediction), but their count has hovered between 60 and 70 for the past five years. In my mind, bold assertions like this erode the credibility of his predictions, especially when he's commenting on issues beyond the purview of his own field.  He also included the following bit of tripe:   America's current supply of brilliant scientists and engineers retires, without adequate replacement by an ill-educated younger generation   His articles frequently include arrogant assumptions like this, interspersed throughout more substantive material. They serve to reinforce his rhetoric but have no foundation in reality. This part in particular reminded me of an old man raving about ""today's youth"" and seemed out of place in what was supposed to be a geopolitical article.  Just as with predictions of China's ""collapse"", there's good money to be made writing about American ""decline"". The U.S. will definitely experience a relative decline as the rest of the world catches up following the devastation wrought by European colonial struggles and two world wars, but to say that the U.S. will lose all influence is as ridiculous as saying that China will implode."

geopolitics,3a6suj,di11deux,18,Wed Jun 17 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Having such close proximity to the US, it would be a matter of ""if"", not ""when"" Chinese subs were detected transiting through. At that point, Chinese infrastructure projects would struggle to maintain their distance from Beijing's geopolitical ambitions.  The further apart Chinese companies can appear to be from the CPP, the better off they'll fare.  I think the most logical explanation is China now has a lot of really rich people who have no idea what to do with their money."
geopolitics,3a6suj,ccm8729,11,Wed Jun 17 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Can subs actually sneak through a canal like that?  Thatd have to be a coordinated effort between the sub and the operators, wouldnt it?"
geopolitics,3a6suj,wemptronics,18,Wed Jun 17 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"Sneak through? No. This is what a sub looks like traveling through the Panama Canal. They are just man made waterways, not portals of infinite depths. It takes a lot of man power to get large vessels through the PC and takes a good bit of time. It's not a covert operation.  I'm sure, if it comes to it, the US will implement a system to track any subs passing through the canal. Whether they can, or are willing to, track them further than that is more up in the air.   I think it's pretty inevitable we'll see Chinese vessels patrolling close to US territory or interests. It seems like a reasonable response from a nation that believes the US violates their own territory regularly."
geopolitics,3a6suj,Namika,30,Wed Jun 17 22:59:12 2015 UTC,"I find the entire concept of ""China is doing this for their navy"" really quite silly. It's not like the Panama Canal is the only way to reach the Eastern US coast with naval assets.   Submarines can sail around the Tierra del Fuego without issue. In fact, even if China did have a canal in Nicaragua, their subs would still be better off sailing south around the continent because any Chinese naval assets going through a narrow canal would be tracked and monitored with impunity by the US. Why would you send your submarines through a narrow gate to be tracked, when you can silently and unknowingly slip them in via a slightly longer route?  These military assets don't need the faster route possible, they aren't cargo ships that need to shave days off a route for maximum profits. Submarines are meant to loiter for many months at a time. Adding an extra few days and sailing south around S.America makes a hell of a lot more sense than shining a spotlight on your intentions and sailing through a narrow surface canal. The only time shaving a day or two off the trip would be worth it to the Chinese navy, would be if there was a shooting war going on and China wanted to get assets into the Caribbean ASAP. But if that was actually the case, the Nicaragua canal would find itself closed within minutes from a single cruise missile ruining China's 50 billion dollar ""naval investment""."
geopolitics,3a6suj,NSNick,2,Thu Jun 18 00:38:01 2015 UTC,"even if China did have a canal in Nicaragua, their subs would still be better off sailing south around the continent   The only argument I can think of to blatantly and openly send Chinese naval ships through the canal would be to publicly flex their muscles."
geopolitics,3a6suj,tankyoucomeagain,2,Thu Jun 18 06:35:33 2015 UTC,That's something they can already do in the Panama canal.
geopolitics,3a6suj,wemptronics,2,Thu Jun 25 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Chinese are just doing it for their navy, but it ties in nicely. This canal will undoubtedly provide influence for the Chinese and that seems to be their main drive. Generally starting with economic ties -- like we're seeing them do in Africa -- that leads to more diplomatic and political strength globally. While the Chinese have begun to lead the front in 3rd world development they have also begun stacking up military strength and clearly have a goal of global force projection; just as the US has today.  A canal that is Chinese owned gives China, as a whole, a lot more influence, prestige, and legitimacy. Of course China could send their vessels the longer/more expensive way, but this is basically a fast track for China to say:  ""Hey our Navy and global influence is relevant. Why does the world have to rely on the US Navy to protect free trade? Look! We are more than capable as the next leader in free trade and shipping protection.""  No, their military doesn't need the fastest route, but maybe the Chinese see doing something overt and visible as more aligned with their interests than just the logistical benefits of building the canal. They are consolidating strength, in many different areas, one block at a time. This is just one step in a long road of building, maintaining, and exerting Chinese economic and military power. Presumably, they seek to usurp the US as a super power. This will require Chinese interests of all kinds, in all corners of the globe."
geopolitics,3a6suj,svenne,5,Thu Jun 18 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"They're never going to be able to, very easy to just install hidden camera somewhere or get a mole among the civilian workers there for US intel (no way US will allow chinese military solely organizing the canal)"
geopolitics,3a6suj,austarter,2,Wed Jun 17 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"Detected transiting through, is not sneaking through. The question is who will allow them to pass through unannounced or what will happen when there is another piece of infrastructure with it's independent governance they can interact with."
geopolitics,3a6suj,UpvoteIfYouDare,5,Thu Jun 18 14:15:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have doubts that this canal project will be completed. Construction ""began"" back in December and last I heard they've only put down a few roads for construction vehicles. I understand that a canal is a massive project and takes time, but that's not a lot to show after six months. Granted, there could be more planning necessary once ground has been broken. Perhaps someone more experienced in large-scale construction projects could clarify whether or not a lack of progress early on is a normal for projects of this size."
geopolitics,3a6suj,ofarrizzle,8,Thu Jun 18 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"I can't speak on international projects, but in the US a lack of progress in the early stages of a large construction project is practically expected. Roads being built after only six months sounds pretty good. Based on what wikipedia has the first phase of construction is getting the supporting infrastructure in place (i'd imagine this includes the roads you mentioned). However, the construction time frame of 5 years seems unreasonable for such a large project.  The things that concern me are that 1)the project isn't fully funded (details on investors are sketchy at best), and 2)the lack of expertise that the prime contractor (which is the main investors own company) and Nicaragua have in large scale construction projects. Whether or not it gets built, China is getting a solid foothold in a country with cheap labor, and a great potential as a source of cheap manufacturing labor, per Stratfor, Nicaragua could be one of several cheap manufacturing successors to China, once China's wages and standards of living presumably rise."
geopolitics,3a6suj,Azarka,2,Thu Jun 18 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I think the most logical explanation is China now has a lot of really rich people who have no idea what to do with their money.   Considering that the wealthiest in China must have Party membership or connections to get there, the issue becomes much more complicated.  It makes for dangerous intersections between personal ambition, greed, incompetence and state power."
geopolitics,3a6suj,warsie,3,Thu Jun 18 03:50:08 2015 UTC,"The concessions offered to the Chinese to build free-trade zones, transport links and other infrastructure along the proposed route could be of potentially greater value than the canal alone. Something similar to the Colón Free Trade Zone but greater in scope.  So it might make economic sense for the canal operators even if the canal traffic doesn't reach the estimated demand.  The only caveat is the plan rests on the assumption that the canal will create a virtuous loop in the Nicaraguan economy making the other investments profitable."
