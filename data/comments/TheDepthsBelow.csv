TheDepthsBelow,3e0ww2,otteratthebar,43,Tue Jul 21 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"This has been one of the anomalous things about giant squid, many of the earliest stories revolving around them described them at the surface alive and active, yet since we've begun to document them we've only ever found them dead on the shore.   For a long time people debunked the stories as just that, stories, maybe the crew had just found a dead specimen adrift. However, there were some surprisingly well documented historical encounters with credible sources (Military ships, merchant marine) that described the animals coming to the surface on their own and submerging again.   Who knows, we have barely scratched the surface on these animals, and the ocean is a big place. Maybe this is more common than we think and just haven't had the time or luck to document it."

I'm really surprised to hear you say that octopus pose any real danger. I've never heard of any warning about octopus. To the contrary usually the dive master will try and signal to the rest of the divers when one is encountered. usually seeing an octopus on a dive is a highlight. I've seen one change colors and it was awesome.  I did some Google searching about the dangers of octopus and SCUBA divers and wasn't able to find anything other then cautions about the Blue-Ringed Octopus, which is because of it's venom.  So, could you cite anything that says that Octopus should be something a diver should worry about? Otherwise, I think I'll continue to be excited when I see one on a dive. Although of course I'll just observe and not touch like any other sea creature."

Their head is shaped that way to help scan the bottom for bottom dwelling fish that might hide under the sand.  Along their head (and in the snouts of most sharks) are amuplie of lorenzini which are electroreceptor sensing organs, they look like little black spots dots.  Their crazy shaped heads evolved that way to give them a better shape to scan a wider area of the sea floor with their electroreceptors.  source: used to obsess over sharks in HS.  edit: this was kind of an unasked for post but i couldnt help myself."

TheDepthsBelow,3cbw9u,dementedsoldier,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:23 2015 UTC,Getting sucked deeper and deeper in an uncontrolled torrent of water.  All you can do is watch as it gets darker and darker.  You have to keep equalizing the pressure in your ears again and again to make sure you don't rupture your eardrums.  Ugh...
TheDepthsBelow,3cbw9u,Clay_Statue,10,Tue Jul 7 04:18:06 2015 UTC,Except you just have to inflate your BCD to counter it. lol
TheDepthsBelow,3cbw9u,zedoktar,5,Tue Jul 7 04:19:34 2015 UTC,I'd also drop my weight belt as well.  If the current was strong enough it could overcome your BCD's maximum buoyancy.

I swear we were able to feed fish and they all came up to us. This last visit they made a big deal about not feeding the fish. But I saw turtles on that same trip to Maui. Was pretty amazing seeing so many it felt like.
TheDepthsBelow,3cbw9u,dementedsoldier,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm guessing people were feeding the fish poorly or just causing other issues. Hawaii doesn't have a ton of sharks around it and the bigger ones like areas with bigger prey, which isn't around where we've been out. Seeing a sea turtle was great though, pretty magic sight."

TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,phalangion,3,Wed Jun 24 17:21:23 2015 UTC,Don't kill it. Put it back.
TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,Oh_mrang,10,Wed Jun 24 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, that was what I suspected you say. But let's think - how?  Do they cut their nets, and cost themselves thousands?  Do they wrangle and flip it out of the net?  Those are the two options for release, as decking a live shark that size is a suicide mission. If you catch a halibut over ~150lbs, you have to kill it before getting it in the boat because decking it live is incredibly dangerous. Tuna are a similar way.  We're talking about a fish that is tens of times heavier and exponentially stronger than a halibut or tuna. Dragging it to the harbour is likely to kill it anyways.   So what's their choice?  Fisherman operate on frighteningly thin margins, so keeping that in mind what do they do?"
TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,holycrapoctopus,-3,Wed Jun 24 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"The best solution is to regulate fishing gear so as to reduce bycatch as much as possible. This usually involves limiting the size of boats/nets, banning things like bottom trawling and blast fishing, and enforcing protections for endangered species through litigation.   Industrial-scale fishing in most parts of the world is simply unsustainable, regardless of whether it's ""their livelihood"" or whatever silly emotive reasoning people use to defend an industry that is destroying the marine ecosystems we depend on for our very existence.  Basically, we want lots of small boats with strict quotas, not vessels large enough to ""accidentally"" catch a basking shark."
TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,Oh_mrang,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take a large vessel to accidentally catch a basking shark.  I'm also not sure why you put ""accidentally"" in quotations, because there is almost no way for them to have targeted a basking shark.  Commercial fishing in some parts of the world is unsustainable, sure.  But the solution isn't necessarily to limit the existing fisherman's ability to catch fish (and therein survive), as when you're alone in that big blue sea, rules seem more like a guideline.  The issue of commercial fishing requires a whole hell of a lot of thought and attack from all sides.  Regulating vessel and equipment size isn't going to do much of anything good."
TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,holycrapoctopus,0,Wed Jul 1 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that my response was overly simplistic (this isn't a fisheries management forum) but I'm not sure what exactly your objection is. I was mostly talking about managing to avoid bycatch of endangered species, not sustainability as a whole.  Are you familiar with the concepts of maximum sustainable yields, biological productivity curves and replacement rates, management of commons, bioeconomic modeling etc? If yes, we can talk dirty about how to sustainably manage fisheries. Otherwise you probably don't want to start this argument"

TheDepthsBelow,3axtaq,GiantSquidd,6,Thu Jul 2 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't get, though, how the shark can be vulnerable because of overfishing yet scientists rarely see it.   Are these Aussies just the first nice enough to donate their bycatch to science?"

Ogopogo has been allegedly seen by First Nations people since the 19th century. The most common description of Ogopogo is a 40 to 50-foot-long (12 to 15 m) sea serpent.  British cryptozoologist Karl Shuker has categorized the Ogopogo as a 'many hump' variety of lake monster, and suggested it may be a kind of primitive serpentine whale such as Basilosaurus. However, because the physical evidence for the beast is limited to unclear photographs and film, it has also been suggested that the sightings are misidentifications of common animals, such as otters, and inanimate objects, such as floating logs.

TheDepthsBelow,3a8qpo,Sharzona,8,Thu Jun 18 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"The sturgeon also swims fresh waters. They've been known to tip canoes and kayaks, and with the frigid waters they often inhabit, the elements kill whomever was involved.   Meanwhile, the gar you've posted has been proven time and time again to be a fairly gentle giant, and won't even consider attacking a human as a prey source, as they plain and simply couldn't eat one.   So, to clarify; Sturgeon, not very menacing looking, can be VERY dangerous. Gar, very menacing looking, not very dangerous at all."

I think I still have an old boardgame in the back of my guest room closet, it was a Crocodile Hunter game and it included 2 different verisons of Steve and his girlfriend (4 players) and you would have to travel around the board via cards I think. There was this motorized, battery operated crocodile toy that you revved up after the appropriate card was drawn, and if you got hit you started at square one, and if you were behimd a barrel you were safe. The characters were propped up on this fence thing the whole time. It was a pain in the arse to set up but, reminds me so much of Irwin and the fact that I still have it is even weirder.  Oh, the cards that activated the croc said ""DANGER! DANGER! DANGER!"" Which is what reminded me of it. I wonder if it would go for any decent money."

TheDepthsBelow,3a5bdc,seaharechasr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, it's that ray photo, thanks for mentioning this. I've seen that said multiple times, thing is, that is exactly how they look when they cruise up & down the shallows & the shallow brackish water in that pic is very like our main ray feeding spot, which is off the bay & near a mangrove swamp at Huskisson/Woollamia. Rays cruise the length of our beach every summer day, you can set your watch by them, so it's a sight I'm very familiar with.   However, being a tourist area we get a lot of kite fliers & they do sometimes create a shadow that looks a little like a ray. This photo really looks like a ray. They don't stop cruising up & down the beach just because someone's flying a kite over them & they're pretty curious about human activity in general - they will hang around & follow people & objects. So I've always wondered if there's actually a wide shot showing the kite & no other shadow or if people unfamiliar with ray behaviour just assumed it was the most reasonable expanation for the photo, because it wouldn't surprise me at all if a ray followed or stopped to watch a kite.  Does anyone know for sure? I'd love to know for certain (& just in case it sounds that way, this isn't an argument, I'm genuinely interested).  Edit : just looked again & I'm 100% sure that's not a kite - have you ever seen a kite string thick enough to throw a shadow at all, let alone one that thick on an overcast day?"

There's an old guy at my local beach who's been swimming with them (unintentionally) for 30 years. All he has to do is stand at the edge of the rockshelf & within 10mins rays of all types & sizes are crowding around him. Some come out of the water & onto the rocks to greet him - it's an amazing thing to see.  This is a little further south from us but it's the same stretch of coast & this will give you an idea of the way they behave in the wild  https://a2.muscache.com/ic/pictures/28221080/1999c510_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large&output-format=progressive-jpeg&output-quality=70  They're not an aggressive animal at all - unless severely provoked."

In the other clips from this segment you can see lampreys attached to the rays and falling off during the jumps. You also see many doing it that have no lampreys, so they might do it instinctively regardless of whether they currently have lampreys or not. It might be a mating display. It's really hard to tell the gender of rays so it might be that only males are doing it while the females stay below the surface, passing judgment as they always do."

TheDepthsBelow,39m5cz,Chess_Not_Checkers,28,Fri Jun 12 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Their throat is only a couple inches wide. So you wouldn't make it past the blue whales mouth.

They're baleen whales so they don't really have a ""bite force"" they just close their jaws. The damage would come from the momentum of the mass. It would range from a sprained wrist to breaking your neck if it caught you just right.  The main point to take away though is that they couldn't eat you and they wouldn't want to eat you."

TheDepthsBelow,396erl,open_minded89,6,Tue Jun 9 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"Good question.   The very idea terrifies me, but let's go on a dive with a sperm whale.   We start at the surface. Our sperm whale is getting ready to go hunting. Her hunting grounds are where the squid and other tasty sea creatures are bountiful - a world where ""the sun don't shine."" Straight down. Way down. Into total cold crushing blackness.  If our whale has just come up from a dive she first spends 10 minutes or more clearing her lungs, blowing a breath in and out every 12 seconds. She's getting rid of old carbon dioxide from the last dive and loading up with fresh oxygen. She's got to store up a lot of oxygen because she will be holding her breath for the next 45 to 60 minutes.  Most of the excess oxygen for the next dive will be stored in the huge powerful swimming muscles.   Finally our whale is ready to dive. She takes two more huge gulps of air, points her head down, raises her flukes (tail fins) out of the water and dives straight down. Now she starts swimming straight for the bottom. She is swimming steadily (or gliding - new research indicates that many cetaceans, and other diving marine mammals, glide more than swim when they are going down) at 3 1/2 miles per hour (5.6 km/hr). This is a fast walking pace for humans. It is probably the most efficient speed for the whale. It is important to be efficient now. Swimming too fast would waste oxygen. Too slow would waste time.    Read on from there"
TheDepthsBelow,396erl,Sobertese,2,Wed Jun 10 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"so it can in fact store the oxygen somehow, that's fascinating. maybe ppl devellop some sort of performance enhancement substance by researching this ^^"
TheDepthsBelow,396erl,cemlynb,4,Wed Jun 10 08:52:24 2015 UTC,"They actually collapse their lungs, and store oxygen in highly adapted myoglobin and haemoglobin within their tissues, as having air in the lungs would cause decompression sickness"
TheDepthsBelow,396erl,Mad_Pistachio,-1,Wed Jun 10 09:34:03 2015 UTC,Myoglobin is the pigment most whales use to hold on to oxygen for deep diving. It the same pigment that black people have. This is why they are able to run faster and for longer
TheDepthsBelow,396erl,WorkingMouse,2,Wed Jun 10 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"I think we're going to need a source on that last bit; as best I recall, myoglobin is only found in human blood after muscle injury."

TheDepthsBelow,396erl,Shark4760,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:39:25 2015 UTC,A human can survive a depth over 100ft without diving equipment. So maybe it's just that they're bigger they can dive deeper?

TheDepthsBelow,393owp,Zelbia,11,Tue Jun 9 01:22:47 2015 UTC,These guys don't have the really long neck.  There are 2 types - the Alligator and the Common.  The Alligators are usually bigger and gnarlier with a really long tail and the Commons are smoother with the super long necks.  It's the Commons that will reach all the way back along their shell and bite the living crap out of you.

TheDepthsBelow,38ohg8,kkaallaaee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:46:19 2015 UTC,I think the scary part is that scientists don't know why they school like this. They're typically solitary iirc. Source: heard David Attenborough narrating on Blue Planet one time... I think
TheDepthsBelow,38ohg8,SwoopDaWoop,3,Sat Jun 6 01:38:28 2015 UTC,I think it's theorized that their schooling is for social purposes. The alpha male swims in the middle of the school and the females mate with him. They go solitary at night for hunting and stuff.

TheDepthsBelow,38a8t7,DragonflyRider,6,Wed Jun 3 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"Google ""Bathysphere"". Basically it's not all that wrong. The problem with making other shapes is pressure. No other shape is as resistant as a sphere. If you look at the Deepsea Challenger, you'll notice that it's (at it's core) also just a sphere, with some stuff around it. On the Bathyscaphe Triest, the only thing with people in it also was that small ball, hanging underneath, the rest mainly was a huge floatation device, which was filled with gasoline, because (like water and unlike air) it can't be compressed, but it's actually lighter than water.

TheDepthsBelow,382ask,of_skies_and_seas,2,Mon Jun 1 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"It's probably because they're dead specimens that have undergone some sort of preservation.

TheDepthsBelow,37m1y7,rit100,2,Thu May 28 19:20:31 2015 UTC,This was originally considered by-catch and tossed back until it was discovered  how tasty they were.  Being a near bottom dweller they were too few in number and there are concerns that it's being over fished.  I haven't enjoyed any since the seventies.

They have also been recorded preying on usually terrestrial species such as moose swimming between islands.  However, wild orcas are not considered a real threat to humans, as there are few documented cases of wild orcas attacking people, and no fatal encounters.   In captivity, however, there have been several non-fatal and fatal attacks on humans since the 1970s.  Experts are divided as to whether the injuries and deaths were accidental or deliberate attempts to cause harm.

We may as well be aliens on a different planet.

TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,Subliminal_Pizza,4,Mon May 18 06:04:07 2015 UTC,Another serious danger is stirring sediment from the floor of the cave. Lots of people die getting lost in dust clouds they accidentally kick up
TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,WorkingMouse,4,Mon May 18 02:57:04 2015 UTC,Indeed; some of the most deadly caves are those that have chambers of fine silt at the bottom where it's easy to kick it up accidentally.
TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,tamasys,2,Mon May 18 03:03:17 2015 UTC,Why is this such a danger? Can't they just stay still until the cloud settles?
TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,Fr3ddyJedd7,3,Mon May 18 13:33:49 2015 UTC,It depends on how fine the silt is and if there's any current to help wash it away. It can take a long time to settle given the right conditions. Not to mention you only have so much air to wait with.
TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,tamasys,2,Mon May 18 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. Thanks!"
TheDepthsBelow,36b0tk,HighUnicorn,2,Mon May 18 21:13:25 2015 UTC,Second biggest danger is called nitrogen narcosis. The nitrogen levels can cause divers to feel over condifent and disoriented making it easy to get lost.

One proposed method was, since we've observed that the biodiversity increases as the size of the animal decreases, to assume that we've discovered most larger animals and then extrapolate that number to estimate the diversity of smaller species. Another method was apparently derived from the observation that there's a pattern to the difference in population size between different taxonomic levels (families, genera, species, etc) and use figures from well-documented branches to estimate the figures from poorly documented branches and sum it up to get a global figure."

It is often associated with, but not closely related to, the common snapping turtle, which are in the genus Chelydra. The epithet temminckii is in honor of Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.   Although it was once believed to be only one species, a recent study suggests that it is actually three separate species; Macrochelys temminckii, Macrochelys suwanniensis, and Macrochelys apalachicolae.    The alligator snapping turtle is given its name because of its immensely powerful jaws and long spring like neck, as well as distinct ridges on its shell that are similar to the rough ridged skin of an alligator.

The Dead Marshes were part of the ancient battlefield of the Battle of Dagorlad between the Last Alliance and the forces of Mordor, where many of the fallen were laid to rest. Over time, the battlefield became marshes, which swallowed up the dead, though their bodies could still be seen floating in the water. During Gondor's war with the Wainriders, King Ondoher's army was caught by surprise and he and men were driven into the Dead Marshes and defeated. When Eärnil II became king, he avenged the earlier defeat at the Battle of the Camp in TA 1944, and the Wainriders were defeated and driven into the marshes where most perished. The Dead Marshes were located north-west of the Morannon, and southeast of the Emyn Muil. Aragorn once captured Gollum here, on February 1, 3017 and took him to Mirkwood.

TheDepthsBelow,35q6wj,Checkheck,33,Tue May 12 16:37:33 2015 UTC,OOOH! I've actually been down inside it SCUBA diving. The deepest you're allowed to go by most dive masters is about 120' (right about where it opens up into the central piece in the last image). It's also incredibly scary.
TheDepthsBelow,35q6wj,Yimris,16,Wed May 13 00:30:40 2015 UTC,Are there actually sharks and stuff swimming down around there or was the illustrator of pic four using artistic license?
TheDepthsBelow,35q6wj,Prancing_Unicorn,22,Wed May 13 06:01:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't see any, but the guide mentioned that others see them from time to time. Also, the divers illustrated on the drawing are about 50 feet too far down. They would likely only have a few breaths of air that deep, and there are tons of undercurrents that can pull you straight to the bottom if you get too deep. SUPER dangerous to go past 120'."
TheDepthsBelow,35q6wj,Yimris,17,Wed May 13 06:49:23 2015 UTC,Well that's mildly terrifying.
TheDepthsBelow,35q6wj,Prancing_Unicorn,5,Wed May 13 07:11:54 2015 UTC,"I think they're just trying to scare you so they don't have recreational divers trying to go deeper than they should. I mean you have a can of air strapped to you that will allow you to float no matter the currents. I also bet there are a ton of divers on exotic gas mixes that go to the bottom (or close to it) fairly regularly.  Edit: It seems like most of you aren't familiar with advanced scuba diving, see my reply for proof."

TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,theredball,56,Sun May 10 00:37:07 2015 UTC,Are Goliath groopers common for human consumption?
TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,exxocet,60,Sat May 9 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"They have become uncommon because people have eaten too many of them, but there are concerns not only about the population size but also about mercury content- they may not actually be particularly safe to eat anymore because a high concentration of mercury through bioaccumulation."
TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,fodgerpodger,38,Sat May 9 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"It's not mercury content people generally think about with goliaths. It's Ciguatera poisoning, a toxin that accumulates in any fish who prey on reef fish.  One of the reasons a lot of people don't eat big barracudas and sharks too.  edit: not that mercury isn't a concern."
TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,exxocet,16,Sat May 9 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"If they aren't worried about mercury they should be, concentrations are high enough to effect the fish and many ""exceed United States governmental advisory criteria for human health"" [PDF]."

TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,Felixer86,2,Sat May 9 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"You can definitely eat barracuda, it's actually quite a delicious fish. I've had them several times over the years and never gotten poisoned. Then again, I've never fished them directly out of the reef, so maybe they have a different diet."
TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,theredball,4,Sat May 9 22:36:22 2015 UTC,Over a certain size the risk of it goes up a lot. Anyone under like 3 foot is fine to eat.  Large barracudas are the ones that have enough of the toxin built up in them potentially to cause harm
TheDepthsBelow,35ey72,Felixer86,2,Sat May 9 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's a bit concerning. Do you have a source for that? I'd like to send some info to a few of my friends who often eat it. I've had a couple of 'em that were over 3 feet. Never really had any problems, I guess I got lucky."

Their population decreased so badly that a law was put in place to prevent you from catching them. Technically you could eat them but they have a high level of mercury and you could always just eat some normal grouper instead.

The title text's allusion of music playing when Cameron opened this door may or may not be referencing anything. However, possibilities include:  The door positioned as a hatch could reference the hatch in the Lost television series, which characters spent a season trying to get into, and reaching it ultimately led to many deaths and calamities. It also could be a reference to H. P. Lovecraft: his stories often contain things locked away that shouldn't be released, such as Cthulhu and Azathoth, the latter of these is connected to music, but not to oceans, and the former of which to oceans, but not music.

TheDepthsBelow,356chp,kevmo837,48,Sat May 9 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"Because it wasn't just fracking. This particular sinkhole was caused by mining salt. Pretty much any time you remove stuff from the earth, the earth has to resettle and accommodate that empty space. Fracking simply isn't the reason we have sinkholes. It can be, but that's like saying clean teeth are caused by brushing them (when in reality it takes a bunch of flossing and mouthwash as well). It's the fact that we're raping the earth of pretty much all of its resources in order to meet the needs of seven billion people that causes these holes.

TheDepthsBelow,34snfk,fwinzor,13,Mon May 4 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"It's fairly rare of course, though oceanic whitetips have been observed to feel drawn towards ship and plane crashes, which is of course very creepy.

TheDepthsBelow,34snfk,SterlingBowman,39,Mon May 4 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"Cases in WWII come to mind in particular. A lot of big ships going down pretty regularly. The story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis talks about contending with sharks. Also when you say 2-5 a year, those are known cases. You have to figure that in the instance of a shipwreck they might just assume the missing went down with the ship as opposed to attacked by sharks. But don't get me wrong I am not saying it happens every time."

TheDepthsBelow,34snfk,myh2oisblue,14,Mon May 4 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"Its not even close to 17, only 3 deaths were recorded worldwide in 2014 and 10 in 2013. And there were 73 total attacks worldwide in 2013, so even if you are attacked by a shark its a pretty low chance that you die from it. Although oceanic white tips are a little bit different, they are the ones responsible for eating all of the people in shipwrecks. We usually dont think of them being dangerous because they live in waters of 120 ft minimum so people on the beach are never in contact with them. Surfers and swimmers who are usually in shallow waters would not be attacked by them. Although bulls, great whites and tigers are considered the most dangerous because they inhabit waters that humans are usually in, a lot of people consider oceanic white tips truly the most dangerous."

Once as I was cleaning an aquarium I noticed something slender swimming in the tank. It caught my eye because the fish in this tank were all large (12 inches or longer) and this little wormy thing was only two or three inches long. I fished it out and realized that it was a leech. I was perplexed as to how it ended up in the tank. As it turned out, the owner of the aquarium was a fisherman who used leeches as bait sometimes. He had leeches leftover from a fishing trip so he just poured them into the aquarium thinking that his fish would eat them. I politely informed him that if he ever did that again, he would have to find a different aquarium service."

They normally feed on small fish and crabs, but will devour human beings if they smell food on a person. Thus, anyone traveling on the lake is advised to wait one hour after eating before entering the lake for any reason.

TheDepthsBelow,32yrz9,Guboj,34,Fri Apr 17 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"No anti-venom, but the toxin is survivable IF you can administer artificial respiration for a day or two.  Sauce  First aid treatment is pressure on the wound and artificial respiration once the paralysis has disabled the victim's respiratory muscles, which often occurs within minutes of being bitten. Tetrodotoxin causes severe and often total body paralysis; the victim remains conscious and alert in a manner similar to curare or pancuronium bromide. This effect, however, is temporary and will fade over a period of hours as the tetrodotoxin is metabolized and excreted by the body. It is thus essential that rescue breathing be continued without pause until the paralysis subsides and the victim regains the ability to breathe on their own. This is a daunting physical prospect for a single individual, but use of a bag valve mask respirator reduces fatigue to sustainable levels until help can arrive.  Definitive hospital treatment involves placing the patient on a medical ventilator until the toxin is removed by the body. The symptoms vary in severity, with children being the most at risk because of their small body size. Because the venom primarily kills through paralysis, victims are frequently saved if artificial respiration is started and maintained before marked cyanosis and hypotension develop. Victims who survive the first 24 hours usually recover completely.[10]  Efforts should be continued even if the victim appears not to be responding. Tetrodotoxin envenomation can result in victims being fully aware of their surroundings but unable to breathe. Because of the paralysis that occurs, they have no way of signaling for help or any way of indicating distress. Respiratory support, together with reassurance, until medical assistance arrives ensures the victims will generally recover well.  The blue-ringed octopus, despite its small size, carries enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes. Their bites are tiny and often painless, with many victims not realizing they have been envenomated until respiratory depression and paralysis start to set in.[11]  As originally posted by u/Jef4Y"

TheDepthsBelow,2zfota,treejumper12,2,Wed Mar 18 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Osedax:       Osedax is a genus of deep-sea siboglinid polychaetes, commonly called boneworms, zombie worms, or bone-eating worms. Osedax is Latin for ""bone-eating"". The name alludes to how the worms bore into the bones of whale carcasses to reach enclosed lipids, on which they rely for sustenance.  Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute using the submarine ROV Tiburon first discovered the genus in Monterey Bay, California, in February 2002. The worms were found living on the bones of a decaying gray whale in the Monterey Canyon, at a depth of 2,893 m (9,491 ft).

You are correct - - it is a Whale Shark. The photo was taken off of the coast of La Paz, in Baja California Sur. That particular one was about 30 feet / 10  meters long. We swam with them for about 2 hours with the Cabo Adventures group down there. They had a photographer with a GoPro, and it was actually she who took this picture. My favorite part of this thread is the guy who swears it's a fake :) I have a few more like this, but this was my favorite. If I think to do it later, I'll post a link to them."

TheDepthsBelow,2y5n3t,missmaia,7,Fri Mar 6 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"Magnapinna Squid Filmed at Drilling Site pangeaprogressblog 41,594 views Subscribe2,678 1460 Uploaded on Nov 30, 2010A mile and a half (two and a half kilometers) underwater, this alien-like, long-armed, and--strangest of all--""elbowed"" Magnapinna squid is seen in a still from a video clip recently obtained by National Geographic News.  In a brief video from the dive recently obtained by National Geographic News, one of the rarely seen squid loiters above the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico on November 11, 2007.  The clip—from a Shell oil company ROV (remotely operated vehicle)—arrived after a long, circuitous trip through oil-industry in-boxes and other email accounts.  ""Perdido ROV Visitor, What Is It?"" the email's subject line read—Perdido being the name of a Shell-owned drilling site. Located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) off Houston, Texas (Gulf of Mexico map), Perdido is one of the world's deepest oil and gas developments.  The video clip shows the screen of the ROV's guidance monitor framed with pulsing inputs of time and positioning data.  In a few seconds of jerky camerawork, the squid appears with its huge fins waving like elephant ears and its remarkable arms and tentacles trailing from elbow-like appendages.  Despite the squid's apparent unflappability on camera, Magnapinna, or ""big fin,"" squid remain largely a mystery to science.  ROVs have filmed Magnapinna squid a dozen or so times in the Gulf and the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.  The recent video marks the first sighting of a Magnapinna at an oil development, though experts don't think the squid's presence there has any special scientific significance.  But the video is evidence of how, as oil- and gas-industry ROVs dive deeper and stay down longer, they are yielding valuable footage of deep-sea animals.  Some marine biologists have even formed formal partnerships with oil companies, allowing scientists to share camera time on the corporate ROVs—though critics worry about possible conflicts of interest.   Based on analysis of videos not unlike the one captured at the Perdido site, scientists know that the adult Magnapinna observed to date range from 5 to 23 feet (1.5 to 7 meters) long, Vecchione said. By contrast, the largest known giant squid measured about 16 meters (52 feet) long.  And whereas giant squid and other cephalopods have eight short arms and two long tentacles, Magnapinna has ten indistinguishable appendages that all appear to be the same length.  ""The most peculiar structure is that of the arms,"" said deep-sea biologist Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.  Referring to the way the tentacles hang down from elbow-like kinks, Robison said: ""Judging from that structure, we think the animal feeds by dragging its arms and the ends of its tentacles along the seafloor as it drifts slowly above it.""  The elbow-like angles allow the tentacles to spread out, perhaps preventing them from getting tangled.  ""Imagine spreading the fingers of a hand and dragging the fingertips along the top of a table to grab bits of food,"" he added."

As they are found at depths of 2,000 m or 6,600 ft, they create complex localized ecosystems that supply sustenance to deep-sea organisms for decades.  This is unlike in shallower waters, where a whale carcass will be consumed by scavengers over a relatively short period of time. It was with the development of deep-sea robotic exploration that whale falls were first observed in the late 1970s.

Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English channel, Irish Sea, North Sea and in western Scandinavian waters down to Kattegat and Øresund. It may also drift in to the south-western part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish, which may be the same species, are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen found, washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870, had a bell (body) with a diameter of 2.3 metres (7 ft 6 in) and tentacles 37 m (120 ft) long.

In some ways, I find the thought comforting in that it demonstrates that attacks are certainly the exception."
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,WellPaidRichPerson,27,Thu Jan 15 07:39:23 2015 UTC,... I still don't find that comforting

TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,WellPaidRichPerson,3,Thu Jan 15 17:39:52 2015 UTC,I find it comforting because it shows that they really are not that dangerous and attacks are actually rare.
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,Definately_not_a_cat,6,Sun Feb 8 10:12:02 2015 UTC,I'd like to try surfing but the idea that sharks are underneath me is something that is really scary. I was thinking about this just yesterday actually.
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,MichelangeloDude,7,Thu Jan 15 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are, you're never that far from a shark. I live on the East coast of Florida and basically any time you're in the ocean you're only a couple hundred yards away from the nearest shark. Which sounds scary, but it means your odds of making it through the day without a bite are pretty phenomenal."
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,lolplatypus,4,Thu Jan 15 18:19:00 2015 UTC,God damn the ocean is scary. That's why I'm on this sub. I'd like to face my fears some day though.
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,MichelangeloDude,5,Thu Jan 15 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Naw man, the ocean is awesome! You just gotta do it right. Most of the time people are afraid of the ocean it's because you can't see jack when you're sitting there at the beach. What you need is a trip down to Ft. Lauderdale or somewhere. The water there is crazy fucking clear. You can see everything from the surface, and if you bring a mask and snorkel life gets awesome.  If you happen to be afraid of water in general (and not just the ocean) freshwater springs can be a good way to ease yourself into it."
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,lolplatypus,2,Thu Jan 15 18:27:16 2015 UTC,To some people the ocean is scary because it is so wide and full of weird and mysterious things like it animals and architecture. For the same reason some think it is awesome.
TheDepthsBelow,2sgc5h,Definately_not_a_cat,4,Sun Feb 8 10:16:51 2015 UTC,It is extremely fun! Just get a longboard and stick to the shallows.  A long board will work in 2 feet of water on baby waves and is still a lot of fun. Also the best way to learn.

If they sense you nearby, they scramble towards the water. You usually don't even notice that they were there until they're halfway to Cuba    most animals are more afraid of you than you are of them"

They have also been recorded preying on usually terrestrial species such as moose swimming between islands.  However, wild orcas are not considered a real threat to humans, as there are few documented cases of wild orcas attacking people, and no fatal encounters. In captivity, however, there have been several non-fatal attacks on humans since the 1970s.  There have been only four recorded fatal incidents. Experts are divided as to whether the injuries and deaths were accidental or deliberate attempts to cause harm.

Bell-mouth spillways of article  Spillway:       Some spillways are designed like an inverted bell so that water can enter all around the perimeter. These uncontrolled spillway devices are also called morning glory,  plughole, [citation needed] glory hole  or bell-mouth  spillways. In areas where the surface of the reservoir may freeze, this type of spillway is normally fitted with ice-breaking arrangements to prevent the spillway from becoming ice-bound.  In some cases bell-mouth spillways are gate controlled. The spillway at Hungry Horse Dam (pictured right), the highest morning glory structure in the world,  is controlled by a 64-by-12-foot (19.5 by 3.7 m) ring gate. However the largest remains in Geehi Dam, measuring 105 ft (32 m) in diameter at the lake's surface.

TheDepthsBelow,2mt8k9,Hindrock,7,Thu Nov 20 00:21:11 2014 UTC,Whether or not the oil rig is working properly matters not. Unless it's leaking toxins into the water it's the structure the fish want.  In fact non-working rigs tend to attract more life because there's less noise and the legs of the rig no longer have electrical currents running through them. Sharks will tend not to enter the interior of the structure because of this - messes with their senses.  Fun fact: When I was taught about diving on a rig I was told not to put my dive computer near the legs for fear of screwing it up.

I've gone spearfishing in the Gulf multiple times and fish really only congregate around structures. As it goes most of the structures in the Gulf are oil rigs. It's absolutely amazing to see the life on them. They are oasis in the giant desert that is the gulf.
