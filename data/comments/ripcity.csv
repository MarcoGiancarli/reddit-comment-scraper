Skal Labissierre is far more talented than Sabonis and projects far better into the future.  I would imagine he would be a stretch four alongside Vonleh or Davis, subbed by Meyers and Mason or traded as necessary."
ripcity,3e3oet,pinky_the_unicorn,11,Wed Jul 22 00:57:50 2015 UTC,Interesting read but you kinda of didn't say anything at all about Aminu/Henderson etc. for the future. And you called the Afflalo trade a big screw up which I disagree with. To me it looks like we didn't really give up much while it theoretically was a great trade to set us up for post season(I did like the players but realistically) AND like you said we will get to keep our picks most likely.
ripcity,3e3oet,Zarknox,11,Tue Jul 21 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, the Aflallo trade was absolutely the right move to make at the time. Barton and TRob both have much lower ceilings than this sub cares to admit."

I'm especially impressed with Olshey's forethought in making it protected for two years before it turns into future 2nd rounders. In the end, we might not even have to give up a first.   He did kind of the same thing with Harkless, too. Unless we miraculously get really good, we basically got him for free."

ripcity,3e3oet,jamesmunger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:53 2015 UTC,The only advantage he has right now is his time in the system.  He might start at the 4 because of that.  But yeah that's not to say hes ready.  More like there's nothing better right now until vonleh learns the ropes.
ripcity,3e3oet,maralieus,5,Wed Jul 22 00:09:29 2015 UTC,i dont see the benefit of playing vonleh and leonard together.  i would use them each to spread the floor a bit and the defense of each is underdeveloped.  i also would rather see cj come off the bench as the number one scoring option while he is in.  i think aminu and henderson would be a little better defensively in the starting unit this year.   i think plumlee should play next to vonleh.  plumlee needs a creator to get him the ball so he should play with dame.  if leonard was on the second unit it would free up the middle for cj to be agressive in the lane and then kick it out for the outside shot
ripcity,3e3oet,penisbacon,3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"I really really do see the benefit. Leonard is really good on D, as we saw against Memphis when he essentially shut down Gasol. That being said, Leonard is good on defense and a good shooter. Vonleh seems good inside, according to the summer league. Hes also a great rebounder."
ripcity,3e3oet,Arsenal85,3,Tue Jul 21 21:15:29 2015 UTC,You're having a really bad case of recency bias. Leonard had one good short series against Memphis and now he's a really good defender? We're just going to ignore the three regular seasons of bad defense?
ripcity,3e3oet,maralieus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:55 2015 UTC,Yeah he's not really. Yet.  Probably just a bad matchup for gasol.  Like when aldridge used to have severe issues with Samuel dalembert.  He's not good.  But he looked good against LA.

Here's a list of 2016 Free Agents who the Blazers might consider (re: SF acquisitions): http://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/2016/   They may not all be that young, but they will be free agents nonetheless."
ripcity,3e3oet,metaqizzical,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"First order of business is to reequip our front office with the John Nash and Steve Patterson brass knuckles. Then we sign Durant as an FU to OKC and a null on the Oden kerfuffle. Vonleh and Meyers turn beast. Then we finally get CP3 through a trade and boom, dynasty. /s  Serious though, we have some stuff to wade through before we start signing FA next summer. I'm thinking at least 2 to 3 years before we can get any quality through free agency. I am comfortable with NO and his team to get a plan right."
ripcity,3e3oet,mm825,3,Tue Jul 21 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"Many critics have deemed the Portland Trail Blazers 2015-16 offseason as unproductive and ineffective   There are two different ways to look at this offseason. 1) did the front office make the team better than they were at the end of last season? or 2) Did they make the right moves given the fact that LMA, Wes and Rolo were all leaving? The answer to question 1 is not controversial, and when national pundits call our offseason a failure they mean our team will be significantly worse next season.   Also, your assertion that we could win a championship in the next 5 years is just a wild guess. It may be true, but KD, Lebron, MJ, Shaq and even the golden steph curry didn't win a championship in their first 5 years, even if Ben Simmons is that good, things may take time. This was a good offseason given the circumstances, but we're in full rebuilding and any prediction of a championship is based on things that are impossible to predict. You say these players are young and very talented, I guess that's true, but Minnesota and Orlando have better young prospects and there's a bunch of teams in the west who won't be getting worse in the near future."
ripcity,3e3oet,Arsenal85,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"That lineup would be one of the worst lineups we could run, Noah and Meyers are both bad defenders and have overlapping skill sets, CJ and Lillard would get absolutely killed by bigger guards and you've completely left out Aminu who is our best defender now and is younger than Lillard, he still has plenty of time to get better on offense."
ripcity,3e3oet,Quatreveinte,2,Tue Jul 21 23:01:14 2015 UTC,Now we have two baby Sabonis'
ripcity,3e3oet,anoyod,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:50 2015 UTC,Don't forget Harkless and Aminu. Crabbe plays his role well too. We're pretty set at SF. Overall this is a sleeper team. We've got a lot of unrecognized talent. I wouldn't be surprised if we wind up close to .500. It won't help our rebuild efforts so much but it's gonna be a fun team to watch.
ripcity,3e3oet,BarfingBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:22 2015 UTC,We have a lot of offensive talent but are weak on D.  The West is going to eat us up.

When Lillard Time is matched by Entire Opposing Team Time (because defense is very much a team effort, requiring pieces working together), we'll have a lot of frustrating fourth quarters -- certainly nothing close to last year's NBA-best fourth-quarter comebacks."
ripcity,3e3oet,anoyod,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"Davis is good. Harkless can be a solid defender. Henderson is good. I think Vonleh will develop into a great defender. Crabbe is reliable. I'm worried about Dame too, hopefully he works on his game harder than ever and we can get him the help he needs."
ripcity,3e3oet,MrGoatington,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about the same team? It's the opposite. We'll be in playoff contention because of our D. We have crazy defense and not as good but still good offense. Lillard is the defense weak link and it's obvious Lillard's defense will be much improved this year, we can stop talking like he's still going to play bad defense, he's uninjured and leading a team now, he knows that's not even an option."
ripcity,3e3oet,Sm4shBrah,2,Wed Jul 22 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I just don't see Meyers being a starting 5 on a championship team. Something about his style, does not work PERSONALLY for me, I hate stretch 5's they don't rebound, defenders stay closer to the basket. CJ isn't a starting SG to me either, he needs to be the 6th man and THE man off the bench. Luckily if we have a good enough core (CJ MEYERS AMINU VONLEH all grow like theyre supposed to), I think we can address those needs on our championship run team   Lillard / CJ / Backup Starting FA (Ellis/Matthews skill level) / CJ / Crabbe Aminu / Crabbe  Vonleh / Davis  FA Center / Meyers / Plumlee   Our draft guy can fit anywhere between 2,3,5"
ripcity,3e3oet,Arsenal85,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"Which is why we play Meyers as a 4 instead of a 5 like LMA. Just need a big that plays close to the basket like Rolo did for LMA. I agree with CJ though, he's just too small for the starting 2 position and we can't play him as a 1 because he's not a good passer. I think he's best used like a Nate Robinson/Jamal crawford type of player to come off the bench and create his own shot."
ripcity,3e3oet,Sm4shBrah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"I can live with Meyers as a 4, maybe a situational 5, where his goal is to rebound , set screens. (A la play like plumlee ironically)"

ripcity,3e3oet,maralieus,2,Wed Jul 22 01:36:40 2015 UTC,He's a 4 IMO.  Him and vonleh should be 4's.

ripcity,3e3oet,3th0s,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"We did a good job of accumulating a bunch of talent very quickly, and I really believe a lot of our young guys are primed to break out (Meyers, CJ, and Aminu, in particular). Vonleh was also a huge get, and I love how much flexibility we have with all our cap room. So, yes, there are definitely things to be excited about.  That said, any time you lose 2/3 of your roster including four starters and the 3rd best player your franchise has ever seen (in his prime, no less), it's an awful off-season. Like, terrible. Probably our worst since 2000 when we traded O'Neal and Grant for an old dude with hands of stone and an obese crack head."

We got dramatically worse at 4 positions, I'm not sure if we have any competitive depth, and we're infinitely further away from championship contention than the last year or two. It's not like we're sitting on a stockpile of foregin prospects or lottery picks or lotto swaps, and we have probably too much talent to actually tank into the winning 1/2/3 in the lotto, so our ability to rubber band out of the bottom seems especially tricky.   Maybe a better way to look at this offseason would be 'considering the absolute train wreck, we're in better shape than we ought to be'"

ripcity,3e3vks,stupid_sexyflanders,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"I've been preaching it over and over, but the starting lineup will be starved for shooting, and Crabbe brings that to the table, along with being able to play good defense which CJ can't really.  I also think our bigs are pretty interchangeable at this point, you just have to pair one of the more skilled shooters (Meyers, Vonleh) with one of the energy/defense guys (Davis, Plumlee).  I'm leaning towards Meyers getting the start over Vonleh due to experience, but Davis and Plumlee might be too close to call."
ripcity,3e3vks,Khavanon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"This is all our predictions for opening night, but I think it's likely going to change a lot over the season, and we might end up starting the greatest variation of lineups throughout the league by the season's end.

ripcity,3e3vks,Arsenal85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think Meyers will probably start at the 4 just because of his efficient shooting and poor defense. I like that all of our bigs can play the 4/5 and most of our wings can swap between the 2/3.   Really lacking PG depth though, Frazier is showing promise but not sure he's a backup PG and CJ just isn't a PG at all."

Since he left, it's literally a whole new team, one that he basically destroyed single-handidly. We fought tooth and nail to dig ourselves out of the Jail Blazer era (yes, that was mainly thanks to B Roy, but LA certainty helped), and to become a dark horse title contender.

I can empathize with the reasons LMA left, but what he showed me is that he didn't believe in himself as an on and off-court leader, was intimidated by the presence of another all-star while unwilling to voice any of his concerns, wanted a ""safer"" bet on winning a ring and wanted to go back to his comfort zone with his family.

I get it. You were unwilling to carry the torch for RipCity and to lead us to battle no matter what the odds (and despite what LMA believed, the odds were pretty good). We know it's a business, and we understand the type of man you are. You decline our offer to be the man, and for that, we say go fuck yourself.  We have someone who is proud to represent our city and our fanbase. Someone who wears our colors. Someone who can and will speak about his love for this city.   Maybe LMA doesn't ""deserve"" to be boo'd, but as a passionate sports fan and a proud fan of the Portland Trail Blazers, I will boo LaMarcus and cheer for any team to prevent him from accomplishing the easy path to his success.

ripcity,3e0dph,somethingnotyettaken,5,Tue Jul 21 01:42:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought that LA would become our Tim Duncan. No flash, no Lebron, Kobe, Jordan super crazy moves. Just fundamentals and getting us to that ring in a few years with last years roster. SO disappointed."
ripcity,3e0dph,saigon13,16,Tue Jul 21 07:00:44 2015 UTC,"I could not agree with you more. It's one of those things where people go. ""You can't blame him, respect what he did while he was here"" and no, fuck that attitude, I can and will blame the fucker. I hope the spurs go 0-82, I hope Lamarcus never scores more than 10 points again and is disappointing. I hope the spurs suffer for years after the contract. To emphasis how much I want him to fail, I HATE Lebron, there has never been one game where I have rooted for Lebron, but if the Spurs and Cavs play in the finals, then I'm rooting for the Cavs all the way. Lamarcus couldn't handle being the franchise man and will now go try to win a title the easy way. Fuck Lamarcus, Fuck the Spurs."
ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,10,Tue Jul 21 01:59:39 2015 UTC,I mean fuck the spurs just for having it too easy amirite  But no yeah I agree with all those things

He didn't do anything for anyone else while he was here.   I completely respect this and his professionalism was always appreciated.   However, this means he doesn't care for us and we shouldn't him. Negative / positive.   No cheers. No boohs. Silence speaks volumes."
ripcity,3e0dph,stampz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"he got paid and cheered for his time with the blazers, no one can ever deny that, but he doesn't deserve any more than he's already gotten."

We cheer and we're cheering someone who initiated the collapse of our franchise, if we boo we're no better then every other fan base in the league. But we are better than every other fan base in the league and we're smart enough to know LMA doesn't deserve our cheers. It will be even better if the music and random chatter completely disappear in moments where LMA is gets the ball, and I imagine LMA will get the message when he hears nothing as he's introduced. I'll be sitting in an apartment in SF being completely silent, using my LMA shirt as a Doritos napkin, I hope people at the garden have the courage and maturity to do the same."

ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:09 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I will go to the game just to boo him AND to tell anyone around me to fuck off.  You don't like booing?  Better not come to that game.  He is getting booed
ripcity,3e0dph,87vanman,6,Tue Jul 21 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think we definitely understand why you left, LA. That doesn't mean we like it.

I hope the fans politely cheer you and our Blazers give your new team hell when you come visit us in Portland."
ripcity,3e0dph,IDontherun,14,Tue Jul 21 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"I am not booing LMA. I go to every home game. I have seen just about every home game LMA ever played. There might be a smattering of boos, but I think we will behave with dignity and class like we normally do. The only ex-Blazer I recall booing is Raymond Felton.  Edit: Maybe we can just do the Kiss Cam with LMA sitting next to Timmy?"
ripcity,3e0dph,robbiedo,4,Tue Jul 21 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"Three words, ""change of scenery"", encompasses 80% of the transaction. He was just tired of being here. He'd been in Portland almost a third of his life.  How many people today move in their late 20's, early 30's, even if they have a pretty good situation where they were? A lot.  It's all fine, but I do take some offense at the idea that we don't understand why he left. We understand, LA, we just aren't happy with it."
ripcity,3e0dph,HappySpine,31,Tue Jul 21 15:16:45 2015 UTC,They don't understand why I left.   Is LaMarcus calling us retarded?
ripcity,3e0dph,billyboydogg69,7,Tue Jul 21 00:19:36 2015 UTC,I really doubt he'd ever use that word in an interview. He isn't 14
ripcity,3e0dph,jamesmunger,-17,Tue Jul 21 00:35:58 2015 UTC,I think you're 14 since you clearly missed the point I'm making and instead made an irrelevant comment.
ripcity,3e0dph,billyboydogg69,-8,Tue Jul 21 00:47:06 2015 UTC,woah dang that got personal. And I think are plenty of Blazers fans who don't understand why he left
ripcity,3e0dph,jamesmunger,-16,Tue Jul 21 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"You made it personal by implying that anyone who uses the word ""retarded"" is 14."
ripcity,3e0dph,billyboydogg69,10,Tue Jul 21 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"How did he make it remotely personal? Using that word in a professional interview would be very immature, that's what he was implying by the way. Is your ego really so fragile that a stranger on the internet made a comment that you didn't like, and you take it as a personal offense. That word is considered, by many, offensive, and it is very immature and rude to use in polite conversation. If you can't handle somebody making a comment about somebody else, without taking it as a personal offense, then get off the internet until you can handle an adult conversation."
ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,-17,Tue Jul 21 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"What? You seem like the one who's offended. And like the other guy, you're so stupid it's baffling. Obviously Aldridge wouldn't use the word ""retarded."" No shit. You think you're a genius for coming up with that? I never said he would use it. My original comment was saying that when Aldridge says we don't know why he left, it seems like he thinks we're idiots, since it's obvious why he left. You got so hung up on my word choice. Replace ""retarded"" with ""idiots"" and the comment means the exact same thing. NOWHERE did I say that Aldridge was literally calling us retarded.  But after talking to you I've realized that Aldridge is right: some of us are complete idiots."
ripcity,3e0dph,billyboydogg69,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"""You made it personal by implying that anyone who uses the word ""retarded"" is 14.""  Forgive me for assuming that meant you took it personally. You didn't even understand the point I was making to begin with. I never claimed that you said Aldridge called us retarded. I was saying he never implied you were 14 for saying that. My reply had nothing to do with your original comment. I didn't care about your original comment, I just found it hilarious that you took so much offense to what the other guy said. I still don't see how he made it personal. Or why you would take personal offense to ""I really doubt he'd ever use that word in an interview. He isn't 14"". My problem was you getting personally offended at essentially nothing."
ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:22 2015 UTC,That being said. I could have gotten my point across in a less mean sounding way. I'm in a bad mood and should have considered that before replying.
ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,-10,Tue Jul 21 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"I wasn't offended. I was pointing out how dumb it was that he said I made it personal when he did exactly that.    I was saying he never implied you were 14 for saying that.    Except he did. He said that Aldridge wouldn't use that because he's not 14. That's implying that nobody over 14 would say that.   Whatever, I'm not gonna waste my time arguing with someone who can't read. Have a good day."

ripcity,3e0dph,masoe,10,Tue Jul 21 05:21:05 2015 UTC,The whole thing really isn't complex at all.  Aldridge realizes he's not good enough to lead a team to a title so he fled to somewhere that he can ride on someone coattails to victory.  It is what it is.
ripcity,3e0dph,maralieus,4,Tue Jul 21 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"Too weak to lead, but strong enough to follow is what you're saying?"
ripcity,3e0dph,saigon13,4,Tue Jul 21 07:04:21 2015 UTC,Yep.  Not a knock on him really.  Not everyone is a leader.  Too bad he didn't believe in Dame more though.  He's a true leader.
ripcity,3e0dph,maralieus,8,Tue Jul 21 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Fuck man I'm so over this shit. If anything I blame the FO for this horrendous summer (I hope I'm wrong).

ripcity,3e0dph,MyDamnBlog,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:40 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Right there with you.
ripcity,3e0dph,princemyshkin,4,Tue Jul 21 05:17:59 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks that Aldridge has a better idea of what Olshey could have done to really make the team a legit contender during the offseason? At least compared to the rest of us and our pure speculation? Either he knew what was developing on the free agent front and didn't like it or he flat out kept the team in the dark until he made is decision. It sounds like either way he didn't want to be here and didn't leave the team in the best position regardless. Forget him!
ripcity,3e0dph,JusChilln345,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:51 2015 UTC,No way. If Lma had stayed we would have added Greg Monroe to our team.   We could've been even better.
ripcity,3e0dph,irelli,5,Tue Jul 21 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"Does Greg Monroe put the team over the top? I still don't think so. If you think it increased the teams chances that's understandable but I still don't think they stack up with GS. Sign Monroe and lose RoLo, then how do you replace RoLo? Not with Freeland or Kaman. Meyers had a good end to his season, but who knows if that continues next season or if he plays at that level and plateaus?"
ripcity,3e0dph,JusChilln345,2,Tue Jul 21 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we had somewhat moved beyond our need for RoLo. Our defense held up shockingly well when he was out with the broken hand.  He was great when we had no defensive identity, but we had found that last season."
ripcity,3e0dph,irelli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:59 2015 UTC,The budget could have supported the entire core with Greg Monroe.

ripcity,3e0dph,JusChilln345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't. Just saying the team could.
ripcity,3e0dph,realworldeditor,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"They could and I still don't think that puts them over the hump. I think they needed (in addition to a better front court) more backup to either PG or SG and SF. Kind of hard to get a good idea how Afflalo would have done under better circumstances, but I still don't think CJ or Frazier comes through like the team would need. Matthews when healthy couldn't fill all those holes."
ripcity,3e0dph,JusChilln345,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:34 2015 UTC,This interview was on the Ryan Russillo show and can be heard on their podcast. Personally I thought he came off really well in it.

ripcity,3e0dph,MrGoatington,3,Tue Jul 21 03:39:52 2015 UTC,I hope he gets a ring next year. I hope we get multiple rings starting in about 2 or 3 years. He did us a favor by leaving now and letting us rebuild sooner than later (and while Dame is young and can be the face of the franchise without LMA in the way). ITT dudes acting like LMA didn't say yes when they asked him to prom. The first Spurs home game he plays I'll politely applaud the 2nd best (ex) Blazer to wear the jersey. After that he's just another player in the league. Why act like he's Vince McMahon? He did what was best for him. Nobody thought Cleveland looked good for burning jerseys and booing. Have some class Portland good lord. It's probably really attractive to potential big time free agents/draft picks to know that no matter how well they play for us over a 10 year span they will get booed by our fans if they ever leave for a better situation.
ripcity,3e0dph,AntFace,2,Tue Jul 21 07:44:12 2015 UTC,No way the reception his first game back will be majority of boos.  He didn't go Felton on us or anything. He'll be cheered and rightfully so and I have no doubt cause PDX is classy as fuck when it comes to our players.

Forget the narrative of a ""What if Walton/Sabonis/Bowie/Oden were healthy?""  Malone was healthy throughout his career.  He would've helped the Blazers out when Walton got injured.

ripcity,3dyyu2,Casual_Bandit,10,Mon Jul 20 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that had the Blazers kept LMA, RoLo, Batum, and Matthews they wouldn't have been able to make any decent strides for a free agent (barring luck) or drastically improved their chances at winning a title. Had they maintained their status quo the grade would have been.....? C? B? Who cares if the result was the same performance as the last two seasons? If one player is lost to injury and the team can't get out of the first round then I'm sorry I don't think the team was that well off to begin with. I welcome the rebuild and look forward to watching the new guys develop and hopefully gel."
ripcity,3dyyu2,JusChilln345,8,Mon Jul 20 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"Eh it wasn't just losing Wes that fucked us. LMA was injured, Lillard was injured, Kaman was injured and Batum's season was FUBAR from the early injury and he never recovered. Wes was the biggest loss but certainly not the only injury we had."
ripcity,3dyyu2,Arsenal85,0,Mon Jul 20 19:23:10 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I still don't think even with a healthy roster the Blazers were good (or deep) enough to beat GS or CLE or even MEM for that matter. In my opinion they were no better off than the previous season and had a better bench (only slightly).
ripcity,3dyyu2,JusChilln345,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"We were more likely to beat CLE or GSW than MEM. Unlikely we would have beat either of them but Memphis was literally the worst match up for us and injuries only amplified that. I don't think WCF was out of reach for us and with the cap increase we would have had more space to solidify our bench.  Also we were definitely better off, our defense was top 3 for most of the season, where as the previous season we were a bottom 10 for a lot of the season and finished around 15th. Offensively we were top ten for both seasons."
ripcity,3dyyu2,Arsenal85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"I meant better off in terms of where they were expected to finish in the playoffs this year. I don't think the Blazers were better than CLE or GS. I guess I accept your opinion I just don't agree with it. Even with the cap increase next year the Blazers would have had to pay RoLo (not worth that much money given his skill) or find someone to replace him. Who was available for trade or was a free agent willing to come to Portland when everyone else has more money to spend, thus leveling the playing field in terms of money to spend? In my opinion the Blazers weren't set for a title last year regardless of how things shook out and this off season wasn't likely to go any better than it had. LMA was leaving no matter what."
ripcity,3dyyu2,JusChilln345,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Fair point, the loss of Wes shouldn't have been so damning. I think the fact we already have future prospects to be excited for in Vonleh and Connaughton, the off season was a successful first step in the rebuild."
ripcity,3dyyu2,JarekBloodDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:25 2015 UTC,If one player is lost to injury and the team can't get out of the first round then I'm sorry I don't think the team was that well off to begin with   Did you even watch last season at all?
ripcity,3dyyu2,JusChilln345,0,Tue Jul 21 11:51:08 2015 UTC,"I think that without the injuries the Blazers may have made it out of the first round, but I am definitely no sure about the second or WCF. Yes, I watched plenty last season and I saw plenty of holes that needed to be filled. The Afflalo trade was good on paper, but did not end up the way most thought it would; injuries to the player and teammates tends to prevent you from assessing that deal appropriately. There really is no telling how it would have gone this year had everyone stayed, but my money is on them not winning a title. Matthews was not going to get better, neither was Lopez or Afflalo. I really think that roster had reached its ceiling. And I don't think it would have been wise to pay all of those players that much money considering the doubt I have about them winning a title in the next few years. Just my opinion."

ripcity,3dyyu2,Goducks91,9,Mon Jul 20 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think the author of this article understands the ins and outs of what exactly happened at the end of the regular season and in to the offseason free agency period.  If you're rating our offseason entirely on retaining LMA, then we we failed, but we had no idea if he was staying or leaving.  What NO was trying to do was maintain flexibility on our roster while we waited for LMA to make a decision.  We didn't want to resign and injured Wes, and the Batum trade already looks to have brought us high upside in return.  We also brought in a starting caliber center who is arguably better that Rolo and for a fraction of the cost, along with a promising second round pick for a rookie who hasn't even played an NBA game yet.  Oh, and Damian is a ROY with two All Star games under his belt already, don't act like every single GM in the NBA wouldn't have signed a player with those credentials to a max contract.  The Ed Davis and Aminu signings on the cheap were also incredibly solid and underrated moves.  I think arguably you could critique NO for not being able to sign a bigger free agent, but his ability to wheel and deal cheap young players on good contracts while LMA's status was still up in the air deserves some credit."
ripcity,3dyyu2,stupid_sexyflanders,0,Mon Jul 20 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"NO did great, it was brinkmanship dealings. I hope he gets a chance with Stotts to really see the rebuild through from start to finish.  I guess Hughes didn't help things out by announcing the departure of LMA before it was officially broke. There may have been a slim chance of landing a UFA, but meh... didn't seem like it was our season to grab experienced talent, if it meant hovering in mediocrity and losing that protected pick to Denver."
ripcity,3dyyu2,stupid_sexyflanders,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:40 2015 UTC,They're looking at it in regards to next season rather than the distant future. For the situation we faced I think we came out alright.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY

ripcity,3dyyu2,CarbonPhoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"I flipped to the front page of his article, his reasoning for his rating system is actually based on how well teams stick to some type of cohesive long term plan.   Grades will be based on how a team handled its offseason relative to the options it had available. The Philadelphia 76ers, for example, didn't sign any major free agents. They didn't even meet with any. That doesn't mean the Sixers get a failing grade.  They'll score well because they made smart moves that were part of a coherent plan.   So I understand his reasoning a bit more, but it's still hypocritical if you're basing it off how well a team did relative to the options we had available.  Our entire off season success was contingent on the decision of a very private and moody star player who kept a poor line of communication with the GM.  As I said before, I think Neil did a good job building a new team that still could have potentially fit well around Lamarcus, but also gave us plenty of upside as a contingency plan if he did indeed leave.  Once Lamarcus did leave, his plan became the contingency plan, which is not a full rebuild like the Sixers because we still have a dynamic young all star to build around."
ripcity,3dyyu2,ClentRutherford69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Olshey didn't get any love for pulling assets out of a sinking ship, but oh well... preaching to the choir.

ripcity,3dyyu2,broccolibush42,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:10 2015 UTC,Compared to last year?? Sure. But our future is brighter than most teams in the league because of the offseason moves we've pulled. We stole Noah Vonleh and Mason Plumlee. Also got 22-year old Moe Harkless for nothing. In 2 or 3 years we'll definitely see how these moves were much better than they seem.
ripcity,3dyyu2,HarryBridges,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:08 2015 UTC,well i give bleacher report a c- for journalistic quality please revise
ripcity,3dzpzt,Jalo66,7,Mon Jul 20 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he is sticking to this just because the team had some pretty good success with it last year. If thats the case I hope Stotts isn't actally that short sided. I guess we will see how it all works out, and I suppose the only goal this year is get that lottery pick so whatever floats your tank."
ripcity,3dzpzt,loven329,11,Mon Jul 20 23:18:18 2015 UTC,"Terry Stotts has forgotten more about basketball than I'll ever know, so I generally come down on the side of trusting his judgment in basketball matters. We'll see how it works out, but I think this is a mistake."
ripcity,3dzpzt,FunWinterSport,11,Mon Jul 20 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Weird. With Hendo, Aminu, and a host of long, athletic bigs it seems like we'd be a lot better off doing a swarming, trapping defense like Milwaukee."
ripcity,3dzpzt,DrTom,8,Mon Jul 20 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think this is a mistake.  Our ICE defense was sufficient because it worked well with Lopez's slow plodding ways, but with the faster guys we have now we should be trying something different."
ripcity,3dzpzt,stupid_sexyflanders,7,Mon Jul 20 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get it. We started using it when we got Lopez. It doesn't really make sense with him gone."
ripcity,3dzpzt,DrTom,6,Mon Jul 20 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"I mean Stotts isn't a defensive coach, but I'm really going to be questioning his thinking if we're getting torched on open jumpers again when we have the type of players that can cover open space."
ripcity,3dzpzt,stupid_sexyflanders,4,Mon Jul 20 22:24:51 2015 UTC,Gotta build an offense first.
ripcity,3dzpzt,pancakesareyummy,4,Tue Jul 21 01:07:44 2015 UTC,So be prepared for our defense to suck next year but then get surprisingly good. We were an average defense two years ago with arguably better defenders then we will have this year.

He can drive to the basket and finish great at the rim. Just has to overall purify and shape his game some more. Still a little rough on D but he can keep up with 1-5 because of his speed and wingspan.
ripcity,3dy4v2,Bantag,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:33 2015 UTC,So basically we can try to grow our own Big Dick Draymond?

ripcity,3dy4v2,loven329,3,Mon Jul 20 18:12:14 2015 UTC,Perhaps. That's a big leap though. I think bosh with the ability to guard 1s and 2s for a possession is more correct -- more like Davis rather than green on defense.  He won't ever be able to guard the 1 or 2 for a whole game.
ripcity,3dy4v2,irelli,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"No, and no one would expect him to, but if he has the potential to be a good versatile defender on top of all of that potential on offense, we might have gotten a HUGE steal."

Overall, their fans were bummed. He's a project, still a little raw, but with a ton of potential/upside. Good defense/rebounding. Has a decent outside shot. Midrange game needs work. Got injured last season, but if he can stay healthy, could be seen as a steal. I've heard him called a poor man's Anthony Davis.  *edited for spelling"

Sucks you lost Aldridge, but he is getting older, and I guess he found a better situation in SA. Guess it's hard to blame him.  I think you guys, and the Jazz, are going to surprise some folks.

ripcity,3dx2mp,MrFundamentals101,5,Mon Jul 20 06:32:50 2015 UTC,"This has been asked a few times already, but anyway I see it probably being Dame, Henderson, Aminu, Vonleh/Meyers, Plumlee.  Think it's been said CJ will be the 1st off the bench with primary ball handling duties when Dame is off the court. Plumlee has started a bit, and I like better than Myers personally and it'd work well to bring Meyers off the bench. And it looks like Vonleh could start if he plays well during the preseason."
ripcity,3dx2mp,JRLiquidCrystal,3,Mon Jul 20 07:05:15 2015 UTC,"My prediction is: Dame, Henderson (at least for a while), Aminu, Ed Davis or meyers, and plumlee."
ripcity,3dx2mp,theonlyapollo,3,Mon Jul 20 08:32:16 2015 UTC,I think you start Davis at PF but have Vonleh split the minutes to get experience.
ripcity,3dx2mp,ReigNman_,2,Mon Jul 20 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"Those are our most exciting prospects, but I don't think they make a very effective starting lineup (and it would leave our bench unit without any scorers). Plus, guys like Vonleh would probably benefit from playing against second unit players."
ripcity,3dx2mp,DrTom,2,Mon Jul 20 07:36:39 2015 UTC,"I say we just use our chaos against other teams and change our starting lineup from night to night.  Fuck trying to scout us!  Realistically, I think we'll have to actually seriously start either Meyers or Vonleh, not both though.  Davis and Plumlee are more seasoned, but you can't start two bigs next to each other that can't shoot outside of the paint, it would kill our spacing.  I think most realistically it will be Meyers and Plumlee starting in the frontcourt.  I still think Crabbe should be our starter at the two, allowing CJ to be a scorer off the bench at the 1 and 2, and Henderson to be an energy guy off the bench at the 2 and 3.  I see a rotation something like this:  PG:  Lillard, CJ, Frazier  SG: Crabbe, Henderson, Connaugton  SF: Aminu, Harkless (Crabbe, Henderson, Connaugton all slide into the backup 3 spot situationally)  PF: Meyers, Vonleh  C: Plumlee, Davis, Kaman"
ripcity,3dx2mp,stupid_sexyflanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:58 2015 UTC,I think they'll start Henderson. Crabbe isn't ready yet.  I'm also skeptical CJ can play significant minutes at the 1.
ripcity,3dx2mp,bluemazda87,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"My main takeaway from summer league was that Crabbe IS ready to start.  The reason I like him starting is because he provides much needed shooting in a group that's starved for shooting now, and his defense is also looking very very solid.  He shut down Justin Anderson, who was one of the best players in Vegas.  I think CJ can play the point for a bit, but he probably will get more minutes at the 2 actually.  Him and Dame were so deadly together against Memphis, the problem is they'd get way to beat up on defense to rely on it."
ripcity,3dx2mp,stupid_sexyflanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think Crabbe should play, but Henderson is a better player. Crabbe is still making lots of mistakes (turnovers, fouls). I liked the aggression he was showing, but this is his third summer league. An NBA starter should dominate summer league. I still think Crabbe is a promising role player, but I think he's not there yet."

ripcity,3duesp,Hankinswill,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:54 2015 UTC,I'd still say Aldridge though I'm monumentally salty. He was such a rock through a lot of on and off the court turmoil and I can't overlook that. Lillard for obvious reasons. Sabonis because of the reverence he generated and how easy he made it look. Walton for the chip and Drexler for the battles with MJ.   Geez I'm impressionable.

ripcity,3dsn44,billyboydogg69,8,Sun Jul 19 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"I still think Meyers needs more development.  Plumlee isn't so good that he's going to severely restrict Meyers' minutes, and neither is Vonleh if we wanted to go big."
ripcity,3dsn44,pinky_the_unicorn,3,Sun Jul 19 04:45:51 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify:   Are you proposing a lineup with Meyers, Vonleh, and Plumlee?  Cause if so, I'm not opposed. Meyers and Vonleh could give us legitimate spacing with their 3 point shooting ability."
ripcity,3dsn44,mtwolf55,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"No, more I'm proposing lineups of Vonleh-Plumlee and Meyers-Plumlee as our bigs."
ripcity,3dsn44,pinky_the_unicorn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:25 2015 UTC,Ah. Those both make sense too.   Having a big (either Leonard or Vonleh) that can shoot the 3 will be important when AFA is out their. Especially given his 27% 3-Pointer%.
ripcity,3dsn44,mtwolf55,16,Mon Jul 20 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"My money is on Lillard, Hendo, Aminu, Davis, Meyers."
ripcity,3dsn44,DrTom,10,Sun Jul 19 02:38:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think Vonleh has a chance at winning the starting job though as the season progresses. If not this year next year."
ripcity,3dsn44,Goducks91,3,Sun Jul 19 06:05:22 2015 UTC,My thoughts too.  I think it'll be Vonleh/Plumlee off the bench.
ripcity,3dsn44,FuckYouPanda,0,Sun Jul 19 03:28:13 2015 UTC,CJ will start. Henderson should be our fire power off the bench.
ripcity,3dsn44,pixeldrunk,7,Sun Jul 19 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Or CJ is that firepower off the bench, so we can drive up Henderson's value and have a better defender on the opponent's starting two gaurd."
ripcity,3dsn44,RslashPlease,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"Disagree, we don't have enough talent in our starting 5 to have CJ come off the bench. Drive up henderson value? Teams already know what henderson is capable of,he had great opportunities in Charlotte but just isn't any better than avereage."
ripcity,3dsn44,pixeldrunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:02:23 2015 UTC,I'm glad you waited until you were drunk to respond. Where ate you? I want to fight
ripcity,3dsn44,RslashPlease,2,Mon Jul 20 07:07:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Personally I like CJ as instant offense if the bench. He's much more of a potent scorer than Henderson. Plus, he can backup both guard positions."
ripcity,3dsn44,DrTom,8,Sun Jul 19 17:26:06 2015 UTC,This is so bittersweet.
ripcity,3dsn44,DerrickRoseIsBroken,6,Sun Jul 19 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"Plumlee and Davis are the most deserving, but neither can shoot and with Aminu that spacing would be horrible. I think Pumlee/Vonleh or Leonard/Davis are pairs that would probably work the best together. Who will start is anyone's guess that this point though."
ripcity,3dsn44,Longroadtonowhere_,9,Sun Jul 19 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"I personally want to see our young guys that we will be trying to build around play more then anyone. I don't care about winning next year and also don't care if the best available players are the ones getting the most minutes. I would prefer to see a line up of:  PG: Lillard/Frazier SG: McCollum/Henderson/Pat SF: Aminu/Crabbe/Harkless PF: Meyers/Vonleh C: Plumlee/Davis/Kaman  My personal opinion (and there's a good chance I'm wrong on this) is that Henderson, Davis, Kaman, or even, likely Plumlee are not going to be a part of this team in 2 or 3 years time when we are (hopefully) making our push for the playoffs again.   I think, in particular, we need to give McCollum, Leonard, and Vonleh the most playing time outside of Lillard because if we're going to have any chance of making this a short (read 2 year) rebuild, one of those 3 has break out as a border line all-star. Only way that will likely happen is if they play. I also want to see Leonard at least get a chance to start for a part of the season. I think he's at least earned that much with his development.   And overall I'm indifferent to Aminu. I think he's highly replaceable but is good enough to possibly be our SF if we make a playoff push in a couple of years. If someone better is available in the draft at the SF spot though, I think he's gone.  Overall, I know that this is not likely to happen, especially given Coach Stotts' preference for experience in the lineup. Just my personal preference.   The one thing I do know for certain is that the Meyers/Vonleh dynamic as the young future of our front court will be interesting. Will they play together as the 4/5? Will they both battle for the 4 spot? Will only 1 be able to stay long term? I'm interested to see how the duo works out.  Just my 2 cents."
ripcity,3dsn44,mtwolf55,7,Sun Jul 19 03:31:00 2015 UTC,"Even if Henderson, Davis, and Plumlee won't be on the team in a few years, we still have to play them in order to keep their value up. Besides, you can't just throw young guys into the fire and assume they will bake properly. We may have to ease Vonleh and Leonard into heavier minute loads."

ripcity,3dsn44,cmantis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:31:18 2015 UTC,There's only one guy in this line-up who has shown he is a proven threat to shoot the ball.  I don't think this works as a line-up. Even if we're (not?!) planning on tanking.
