memphis,3e4adx,stealth210,17,Tue Jul 21 21:08:41 2015 UTC,It's a shame this place closed down. Got to play Live at 9 there in '07.
memphis,3e4adx,MojoMercury,7,Tue Jul 21 21:22:02 2015 UTC,What ultimately happened that caused it's closure? I was relatively new to the area then.
memphis,3e4adx,user699,7,Tue Jul 21 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong because I'm going from memory, but if I remember correctly, there was a huge crime perception problem (e.g. the same thing that happened with the Mall of Memphis). Once Tower Records went out of business nationally (which, IIRC, caused the Peabody Place store to close), the idea that the mall was further going downhill spread. It was rumored that kids were constantly running around unsupervised, lots of loitering, etc. I remember they put in a ""code of conduct"" that specifically targeted black Memphians, and places started leaving when attendance and sales went down considerably.  You can also read some local commentary about the closures here on TripAdvisor, believe it or not."
memphis,3e4adx,alexandrathegr8,7,Tue Jul 21 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"It's fairly ironic that they implemented strict ""dress codes"" and ""conduct"" rules in order to chase away the kids, but it was the kids who were keeping them in business in the first place.   I remember going and seeing people kicked out for things like wearing a hat backwards.   Once the kids stopped going the mall looked empty, all day everyday, and therefore no adults wanted to shop there either because there MUST be something wrong if no one else is there.   Just really bad decisions all around."
memphis,3e4adx,GhastlyGrim,4,Tue Jul 21 22:42:35 2015 UTC,100 percent spot on.
memphis,3e4adx,alexandrathegr8,3,Tue Jul 21 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Im not sure I 100% agree with that.  My friends and I went there a lot, we stopped going because it just became plain dangerous. The movies were impossible to watch, people would scream and yell during the entire thing. I have seen more than a few fights break out there. Yes there were a lot of people IN the mall, but very few of them were shopping.  People complained about the crime, so they put in strict dress code in an attempt to target ""thugs"". It sucks, but it is what it is. Unfortunately, that was the wrong answer, the reputation had already set in, and people stopped going. It was the wrong move, way to late.  But it absolutely was the crime and thugs that closed the place down, just like the Raleigh Springs mall, Mall of Memphis, and pretty soon the Wolfchase Mall."
memphis,3e4adx,Maleus21,2,Wed Jul 22 04:00:24 2015 UTC,"There were actual crime issues at Mall of Memphis though. A few women were attacked in the parking lot, I think someone got kidnapped as well. They had about half a dozen people killed in robberies at the mall over the course of a couple years. This was in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Caused the mall to build stationary towers in the parking lot like prison guard shacks and that really did nothing to improve image. We used to go there a lot then.   I miss some Goldmine and the place with blue vanilla ice cream."
memphis,3e4adx,KnifehandHolsters,5,Tue Jul 21 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"Crime was vastly over-reported for the Mall of Memphis, though. Rhodes College even did a study about the demise of the mall, and crime was lower at the Mall of Memphis than other local malls. The nickname ""Mall of Murder"" is telling.  That wasn't the only issue with that mall, but still."
memphis,3e4adx,alexandrathegr8,14,Tue Jul 21 23:49:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there were a lot of reasons, but a big one is it wasn't a very good design for a mall. Way too small, and there wasn't anything adequate enough to anchor the ends and foster through traffic. Malls function because of all the foot traffic between the big department stores which anchor the ends of the mall. To get from Macy's to Dillard's, you have to walk past dozens of shops along the way, which you are likely to stop in and buy something. It's why almost all malls are surrounded by at least 3 or 4 major department stores, which all have their checkout registers at or within sight of the opening to the interior of the mall.  Peabody Place was anchored by Jillian's (restaurant/bar/arcade) and Tower Records, with the theater theoretically pulling traffic through the upper level. But none of those could drive shopping traffic, and the design was such that traffic didn't naturally flow from one side to the other anyway.  When Tower Records went belly up in 2005(?), that accelerated its death. The AMC theater was gone around the same time, then Jillian's went a few years later. Slowly every store started drying up, starting from the east side moving west. I think the last functioning store was the Starbucks stand in the middle. That was open at least until late 2008. I think into 2009 as well."
memphis,3e4adx,arojay,4,Tue Jul 21 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, here's the deal. This is the straight non-PC answer (this info came from the top owners and my personal experience). The mall was overrun by obnoxious black kids who brought loudness, violence, weapons, and threatening acts into the place. They just drove everyone away.  Eventually, everyone with money to spend stopped going there. It was just not worth it to go to an indoor place where thugs hung out.  From there, all the business dried up and the stores had to close due to lack of money spending patrons."
memphis,3e4adx,_Duhble_A_,5,Wed Jul 22 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"I think the real problem with the Peabody Place was the socio-economic layout of downtown when it was opened. In 2001, downtown had a very, very small amount of remaining residents. There were few upscale condos and apartments occupied with people who made enough money to justify killing time at a mall. From my understanding, only recently has the housing/apartment market downtown started to come back. Sure there are the hotels and visitors, but who comes to Memphis to dick around a mall?  It was terrible planning. Too many other better things to do downtown and not enough locals to support day to day operations. East Memphians opted to go to the closer Oak Court, and the suburbs drove to Wolfchase."
memphis,3e4adx,Loudog121,7,Wed Jul 22 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"After seeing the pics from the Raleigh Springs Mall, I was inspired to post my pics from Peabody Place where I was working on a project last November. The last time this place was open to the public was 2008 I believe.  Sorry for the poor quality, these were taken with my iPhone and a couple flashlights. The place was pitch black and unpowered except for a couple places in the middle atrium. No light and stale air.  It was an awesome experience to see a place that hasn't seen people traffic in 7 years."
memphis,3e4adx,alexandrathegr8,7,Tue Jul 21 21:12:29 2015 UTC,What was the project?
memphis,3e4adx,allycakes13,4,Wed Jul 22 00:40:34 2015 UTC,Worked on a project there in the old club Atlas windows. You can check it out if you go downtown across from Flying Saucer.  There's a couple windows across from Flying Saucer that have an interactive display using 2 projectors and a couple Xbox Kinect sensors. They are supposed to track people walking by and superimpose figures in the scenes programmed using the Kinect API and some custom scene artwork made by a local marketing company.
memphis,3e4adx,allycakes13,4,Wed Jul 22 02:54:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting!
memphis,3e4adx,allycakes13,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Many years ago, before I moved to Memphis, I was a precocious, sheltered, small town 14 year old girl. Dressed in a long pink skirt, black t shirt with my Emily Strange purse, fresh from Hot Topic, my mom, little brother and I were out of school for the day because of teacher inservice. So we took the two hour drive to Memphis to go shopping and have some fun.   My mom turned me loose in the mall because I was a teenager and didn't need an adult. Mind you I looked about 19 years old then. So I am in the atrium part and looking at mood rings at one of the booths that used to be there. My t shirt keeps riding up because of my purse rubbing it, so I have to keep smoothing it down. After I leave the booth, I head to the music store to look around. That's when two men approach me and ask me to come with them. They were mall security guards and I thought maybe something had happened to my mom so I went.   They took me back to the booth and asked some girl who worked another booth if I was the right girl. She said yes and they asked me if I had stolen a ring. Apparently when I was smoothing out my shirt, it looked like I was stealing a $5 ring. I told them what I was doing and proceeded to empty my purse. I showed them I had nothing and they said I had to follow them.   I was lead down a corridor into an elevator and we started descending. I was taken to an office and a red headed woman asked me my name, address, phone number and social security number. I told her all of this through tears and sobs. She questioned me and once again I offered to dump my purse out. I asked her to please let me call my mom and she said ok. I tried but forgot to dial the area code and asked if she could try again. I told her that my uncle was a judge and my cousin was a DA and that I would never do anything like stealing. I begged her to let me call my mom and then she just told me to leave.   She said just go. And I had to find my way back out to the elevator and then go find my mom with a puffy face and tear filled eyes. When I found her, another security guard caught up with us and told us we had to leave. My mom was confused and I tried to explain to her what happened. She was furious and demanded to speak to the person in charge. The man then told her that I would have been picked up for truancy anyways so she was lucky I wasn't in trouble.   My mom explained that we were from another county and were out of school for the day. He said we still had to leave. My mom wrote a letter detailing the events but never heard anything. That's my story of the one trip to the Peabody Place Mall."
memphis,3e4adx,alexandrathegr8,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a terrible story. I hope these dark(literally) pics didn't cause TOO much of a recollection of that stuff.  I remember it differently coming of age going and going bowling at Jillians and club Atlas when I was 21 back in the early 2000s. It used to be a fun place around when it opened.  You must have gone around the time they were starting to shut down and desperate to find a scapegoat to blame on the blight consuming the place."

memphis,3e3904,alexandrathegr8,9,Tue Jul 21 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Time to come clean. These are my photos and I didn't want anyone to know it was me that posted them when I posted the link last night. I was told I needed a better camera with a better flash and that my pics were ""terrible,"" so I deleted the link out of shame. I'm glad that /u/alexandrathegr8 posted The New Southern's article on my photos.  Long story short, as I had said in the thread I deleted: I'm new to DSLRs and I attempted to use mine inside the store but got horribly blurry pictures, and since I couldn't see to adjust the camera and was limited in how long I could stay in there, I resorted to my phone. The outdoor and mall corridor pics were taken with my DSLR. I'm really sorry I couldn't get professional quality pics inside the stores."
memphis,3e3904,IIsForInglip,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:56 2015 UTC,Your photos are great! That's why I asked if we could use them. You did a service for folks who can't see the inside of the mall themselves. I'm so glad you shared!

memphis,3e3904,SurpriseButtStuff,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm gonna learn how to use this thing right if it's the last thing I do. I've always wanted a DSLR and I am thrilled that I got a pretty good one for cheap. It's a Nikon D3200, and I have a 50mm lens, an 18-55mm lens, and a 55-200mm lens, and a 32GB Class 10 SanDisk SD card. Friend of mine bought it for $600 and sold it to me barely used for $400 because he bought a Canon and thought I'd like to have it. I've got a eBook he sent me to learn how it works."
memphis,3e3904,IIsForInglip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"The best camera is the one you have with you. I don't always have to space to carry my DSLR around with me and will often just end up using my phone or gopro. It's all a matter of having an eye for it and being able to pause and snap a shot when you see something interesting.   The 18-55 lens is great for day in day out stuff, and it never hurts to have a telephoto. I love my 50mm. It's a great focal length and usually 50's have a perfect aperture.   I'd also recommend picking up a 16mm if you ever find the spare change and have any interest in all at macro shots, such as close ups of food, flowers, pets, etc."
memphis,3e3904,SurpriseButtStuff,3,Tue Jul 21 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"I posted a snarky comment, but I decided against it and deleted it. I'll say this instead: this is one of the reasons why people don't try and improve their photography — because people like you, who have a traditional photography education, end up being pretty abrasive.  I never said it was the greatest set of photos I'd ever seen, but IMO, they are great. This guy took a chance and took documentary photos of the inside of a soon-to-be-empty mall. I'd rather see these than one or two photos that are oversaturated and super-contrasted (or even worse, HDR'd to hell) at an ""interesting"" angle."
memphis,3e3904,IIsForInglip,5,Tue Jul 21 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"I actually don't like applying any kinds of filters to my photos -- one of the reasons I don't use Instagram. I feel like I don't need filters or enhancements because I tend to like the way photos look when they are taken. Now that I think about it, I may have had HDR enabled when I took the phone pictures and probably shouldn't have used it."
memphis,3e3904,SurpriseButtStuff,0,Tue Jul 21 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"Instagram Filters need to die in a fire, but that's a different argument all together.  I would highly reccommend a quick levels correction on all your photos in post-production at the very least. Spending a few minutes in lightroom can make a world of difference, especially if you're using the auto settings on your camera rather than shooting with a white balance card.   Automatic-HDR settings on phones aren't really a bad thing. They can definitely make up for some of the shortcomings of the smaller sensors phones use and can keep a photo from being too washed out or from crushing the shadows too severely. I think what /u/alexandrathegr8 was referring to when bashing HDR was the current fad of going completely over the top (example).   Here's a photo I took over the weekend on my phone"
memphis,3e3904,IIsForInglip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have Lightroom, but I have Pixelmator and OS X's photos app. Pixelmator is broken under the El Capitan beta I'm testing, so I've been using photos. I figured out how to do the post processing stuff in there and edited a few of the really ugly photos and got some better results. Noise reduction didn't work as well as I'd hoped but I worked on the levels and saturation of them and liked what I got. When I get back to my computer I'll upload a couple of the edited pics to show the changes."
memphis,3e3904,IIsForInglip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"Glad to see that the post processing was able to help improve them! I haven't used pixelmator, but from my brief experience with the Photos app, it has most of the same features of lightroom. Noise reduction take a very delicate touch to get just right, but you'll get the hang of it with time.   If you ever get bored, Adobe offers a free 30 day trial of Lightroom CC 2015 if you want to see what you're missing out on. If you decide you like it and can justify the cost based on your usage, Adobe will license it and Photoshop CC 2015 for like $10 per month.  The Adobe suite is the most pirated software in the world, so I'm sure you could probably figure out that route as well, if so inclined.   Off Topic: How is the El Capitan beta, aside from the pixelmator issue? I've been tempted to install it, but I'm concerned that I might run into some app incompatibilities as well (Adobe apps are notorious for this, as is Plex)."

memphis,3e3904,SurpriseButtStuff,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's definitely a nice improvement.   You could keep at it and fine tune the setting and it would improve a bit, but the time spent vs the improvement wouldn't be worth it. I would highly suggest getting a sturdy tripod (Everything Manfrotto makes is great, but I carry a Compact Action since it weighs just over 2.5lbs) and using that for any low light shots. You'll be able to keep the ISO low and slow down your shutter to get nice crisp, clear shots that you just can't manage hand-holding your camera."
memphis,3e3904,SurpriseButtStuff,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"My intention wasn't to dissuade anyone from furthering their hobby, which is exactly why I offered to help the photog with any questions they may have.   My issue is more with you as ""Editor-In-Chief"" of a glorified blog. Since you chose to use these photos in a publication, you should have culled some of the lower quality or uninteresting photos to maintain a certain quality of work. None of these photos are downright bad, but a few small improvements would have yielded a vast improvement. Much of the grain in the lower light photos could have easily been corrected by using a slower shutter speed and a tripod or by running the images through a noise reduction filter in post-processing.   I will say this above all else. /U/Alexandrathegr8, if your ""revised"" comment is how you deal with constructive criticism, you have a lot to learn."

If I called you vulgar names or insulted your intellect, that would be a personal attack. Telling you that you need to learn to keep a level head is far from a ""personal attack.""   edit Also, how was I dealing with constructive criticism?   I critiqued something posted on your blog and although it wasn't directly your work, you felt the need to defend it and complain about ""people like me"" and how horrible we are for having an education in photography. There's a difference between speaking negatively about someone's personal photography style and their lack of skill or knowledge. In this case, my comment was directed at the the photographers technical issues.   Owning a DSLR does not automatically make you a photographer, just like owning a scalpel doesn't make you a surgeon."

It's my job to help inform people who visit our blog. His photos did a great deal of that for our readers. If we had limited space, then yes, I would probably pick the best ones to showcase, but thankfully, we're able to show the album in its entirety.  Being an editor-in-chief isn't about cherrypicking things that I think are interesting. I thought, just as I said before, that some photos — while not necessarily interesting to my specific interests — might be to someone else. I'm happy to report that I've been correct thus far since the story went up this morning.  Also, this is more of what I was thinking: ""My issue is more with you as ""Editor-In-Chief"" of a glorified blog."" I appreciate the distinction with the quotation marks and the attempt to attack a project I oversee because you disagree with me.  I wasn't compelled to defend something, you directly replied to me and told me why I was wrong in saying these photos were great. I disagreed.    ...how horrible we are for having an education in photography.   Oooh, that is a bit of a reach. I said people who have a traditional education in photography end up being pretty abrasive — that means the way you approached your criticism (that nobody was looking for, by the way) was abrasive. It was rude. Instead of taking a backseat and letting these photos stand for themselves — especially since he never billed himself as a professional photographer, and nobody exchanged money for these photos — you decided to go on the offensive and cite your education as your source.  Might I suggest next time perhaps messaging the person privately? Or maybe just keeping your comments to yourself if you have nothing nice to say?"

I will strongly recommend against Terry's Termites. They did the inspection on our house before we bought it. The week we took possession we discovered not only old termite damage, but an active colony that was eating through the drywall in the wall of one of our closets. When confronted they tried to say they had treated our house prior to us buying it, but it had never even been drilled for treatment."
memphis,3dy413,funky_monk89,20,Mon Jul 20 14:09:48 2015 UTC,"I help train EMTs and Paramedics here in the midsouth. I've also had extensive training in psych patients. One of the first thing that jumps out is in the TN state protocols it implicitly forbids ""hog-tying"" any patient but in particular psychiatric patients. Granted this occurred in MS the expectations in EMS are pretty well known. There is a condition called excited delirium that, although it's  controversial in diagnosing, has been attributed to several deaths in regards to police custody. The person is typically found in a hyper-agitated aggressive state. This is typically the result of  massive catecholamine release and/or some type of drug use. The patient becomes extremely acidotic and once they arrest they are statistically impossible to revive.  I wouldn't be surprised if this term came out after the autopsy. My thoughts and prayers will be with his family."

memphis,3dy413,Trvth_Jvstice,5,Mon Jul 20 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"He was asthmatic and repeatedly asked for his inhaler, which was denied to him. Last I heard there were multiple witnesses supporting that his inhaler was denied to him."
memphis,3dy413,ColdCut404,5,Mon Jul 20 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"When EMS arrived on the scene, the patient would have been accessed, and if it was determined he was having an asthma attack, he would have been given albuteral using a nebulized inhaler, with O2 and probably solumedrol (a steroid). At that point, the patient would have been taken to a hospital and further treated. If his asthma was bad enough and there was no contraindications, EMS would have used a cpap device.  I've only had a few patients that didn't respond well to the above and they were people who's co2 has built up enough that they had to be placed on a ventilator when they arrived at the hospital."
memphis,3dy413,Trvth_Jvstice,5,Mon Jul 20 22:03:23 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. In order for the breathing treatments to work effectively though the patient should be supine or head elevated. Positional asphyxia is another possible complication with a patient transported in the prone position. Honestly I wasn't there so I have no idea if the even transported Troy this way. It might have been for ease of loading and then they secured him correctly inside the unit. I think they are center mounted rigs so they could have flipped him and four corner restrained him without too much trouble. Maybe?

And, since a possibly intoxicated person cannot be considered alert and oriented x 3, they have to be taken to a hospital.

""Edwards said Goode and his wife were leaving the Widespread Panic concert at Snowden Grove Amphitheater as it began.  “He was under the influence and so the wife began to drive them home,” Edwards told WREG.  At some point on Goodman Road Edwards said Goode got out of the car and began running around.  Southaven Police said they were called to a shopping complex on Goodman around 7:45 p.m. on Saturday.  “They showed up in force and subdued him,” Edwards said. “They hogtied and put his face down on the stretcher.”  Edwards claimed a witness heard Goode scream that he could not breathe.  “The police took him off and next thing that we know he was a Baptist Hospital,” Edwards said.  Goode’s mother got the call that he died around 11:00 p.m. Saturday night.  “The family as you might expect is grieving, and they are not irrational at all, but they want answers. They want to know why Troy died,” Edwards explained.  WREG started questioning Southaven Police about the events that took place before Goode’s death, but a department spokesperson said they were not commenting or releasing any more information Sunday evening.  Goode’s body is being taken to Jackson, Mississippi for an autopsy.  “I’m not in the position right now pointing fingers because I don’t know the cause of death,” Edwards said.""  Not trying to stir stuff up, but I know the man's wife, who is one of the nicest people I've ever worked for, and I know he was an engineeer of some type.   He had an asthma problem, according to friends.  Just wanted to post, I grew up in Southaven, and haven't  been a huge fan of the cops there.

His handle was ""Entropy"" and he was really good at StarCraft and other computer games like Quake, Half-Life, and Counter-Strike. We had a lot of good times together with the other regulars and, although the store closed a long time ago, many of the folks that hung out there developed abiding friendships and some of us still keep in touch via Facebook. I think we were all shocked and saddened to hear of his passing.  You're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts. Calling the reporting of the facts surrounding his sudden and untimely death ""sensationalism"" cheapens his story and is an affront to his memory and his family that not everyone is going to overlook for the sake of your feelings. I feel nothing but sadness at Troy's passing.   I'm not here trying to experience joy of any kind, but rather to correct your ignorance in deference to an old comrade. To that end, I will break it down for you one last time:  SENSATIONALISM: Was Memphis Hero Troy Goode Killed by the Sinister Southaven PD? Shocking Video Shows Killer Cops Loading Him Into Death Wagon!  NOT SENSATIONALISM: Memphis husband/father hogtied by Southaven Police, dies in custody. Video of him lying face down on the stretcher, hands and legs tied.  You won't get any of the digital atta-boys you're seeking for ""calling out"" sensationalism that isn't actually sensationalism, and calling someone an SJW similarly wins you nothing. In this case, it just makes you appear to be callous and jaded. So, learn to differentiate between factual reporting and sensationalism, and while you're at it, learn to be a decent human being and don't 'No disrespect, but...' the memory of a man you obviously never knew. A wife lost her husband, a fifteen month-old boy lost his dad, a lot of people lost a friend, and all you've done is manufacture irrelevant details for you to be victimized by and complain about. These are facts. If only for your own sake, you should really figure out how to tell them apart them from the opinions that you pull out of your own ass.  Protip: If you have to preface what you're saying by acknowledging that you're going to dismiss the most important point of discussion, i.e., a tragic death, and instead focus on an irrelevant detail, i.e., wrongly perceived sensationalism in reporting said death, then what you are really saying is that you have nothing of value to add to this discussion. So, if you find yourself in this position again, consider saving your opinion for a more appropriate time and place."

memphis,3dwci2,hawk121,10,Mon Jul 20 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't. Hence my second sentence. The point being, since he's independently wealthy, why would he insist on the city paying for an Escalade for official business if he could afford it? Why wouldn't a Tahoe or Yukon be good enough? So the fact that he's in a Mercedes on ""official business"" now is either more gross waste of city resources, or proof that he has no problem paying for his own whip.  I would not ordinarily criticize a politician over something like this, but given the money troubles this city has, it speaks volumes when the chief executive can't show a little austerity when expecting it from others."

Others are having an issue with him buying an expensive car using the cities city's money. Either way is whatever. People voted him in, so they need to deal with the choices he makes.  BUT... The mayor should not have to do that much driving. I mean he is the mayor of a major city. If he is conducting business by driving around, he should rethink that.

memphis,3dwci2,GotMoFans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"I agree about the disabled parking. But the mayor's role encompasses so much that it's better for the mayor to go around the city. I'm not saying he or she shouldn't be usually at City Hall, but there are times the mayor has to go around the city for meetings, meeting the people, and being involved. The mayor is often out just speaking as the keynote speaker at events and conferences."
memphis,3dwci2,GotMoFans,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"The City of Memphis had many city offices and places of business. The city is over 300 square miles. The mayor is a full time job. Any given day, the City Mayor could be at a community center in Hickory Hill, a library in Frayser, a school program in High Point, a memorial service in Riverview Kansas, and a career day at White Station.   The mayor has an office... And it's supposed to be the entire city of Memphis.   A mayor who spend all his or her time in the seven floor of City Hall is not a mayor I would want.

The fire inspectors and directors don't ride the trucks or the ambulances.   The point is that people have jobs which require travel. And if local travel is a component of the job, it isn't out of the ordinary for a company car to be provided.  In the case of the Mayor of Memphis, who is the CEO of an $800 million ""company"" which over 7,000 employees, it isn't weird for that position to be provided a modestly luxury vehicle to travel in as part of his or her official capacity.   So if you understand why certain government jobs need specialized vehicles, why is it weird that the mayor who needs to meet with business and civic leaders has an appropriate vehicle provided for official business. Leasing a $40-60K car for the mayor is a drop in the bucket versus actual expenses that are causing the budget crunch.  Again... Should the mayor come to a meeting with Fred Smith or Bill Rhodes in a Hyundai Genesis?"
memphis,3dwci2,reasondefies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of weird world you live in where it would be some kind of terrible blow to a mayor's reputation to show up to a meeting driving a perfectly respectable car like a Genesis.  A lot of people would respect so-called civil servants a lot more if they started doing more things like that, clearly showing that they are concerned about practicality and appropriate use of taxpayer funds rather than looking cool.  Frankly, I agree that the type of car leased for the mayor is not a big deal in a budgetary sense, and it isn't a battle I would be likely to choose - but it blows my mind that you act as though not driving an expensive car should be some kind of huge blow to a mayor's reputation and/or ability to be effective.  If that is true here, that is a huge problem."

A Tahoe or Yukon can easily be a $50k vehicle, so I don't understand the difference. Is it just something to shit on Wharton about? What's next... The mayor's salary? Wharton has to deal with the aftermath of the MCS lawsuit which was the fault of the City Council (including Jim Strickland) and pressure to put more into the pension, which is the fault years of management of various administrations. How has Wharton worked the budget since he's gotten it? Does the executive division spend money on more people since he took over from Herenton in 2009? Is his security detail abnormal for a city the size of Memphis?   The mayor of Memphis travels around the city a great deal. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a major expense. I guess you think it's a good look for the elected chief executive of a major American city to ride around in a Hyundai Genesis. I wonder how the papers in Nashville would run with that one."
memphis,3dwci2,hawk121,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"You're right - it wasn't an Escalade, but I knew it was a Cadillac.  I don't see an issue with providing the mayor with a car (and even a driver), but I have an issue with it being a luxury car. It sends the wrong message and is a waste of taxpayer resources. It should be a more modest car/SUV.  So now that he's riding around in a six-figure Mercedes. I have no issue if it's his own vehicle (other than the shitty handicap parking), but if the city is footing the bill, that's an egregious misuse of taxpayer dollars."

He's usually looking to grab some lunch and shows up with himself & his wife, sometimes with one guy I assume is either his driver or security. But never seen an entourage.

The benefit is that the burden of risk is mitigated moreso than a traditional CSA.  2 years ago we did a CSA with Tubby Creek Farms. They are pretty good about sending a weekly newsletter with what to expect, updates on the farm, and recipes. Pick ups are in Midtown / UMEM area. Definitely worth the money. There's even some events at the farm to get a more personal relationship. http://www.tubbycreekfarm.com/our-community-supported-agriculture-csa  Last year we went with the Jones Orchard CSA. We wanted a CSA with more fruit options than veggie options, so this was perfect for us. Some newspaper took our picture as we were walking away with a flat of strawberries (8 lbs). During down times like early spring, they supplemented their produce with jams and apple butter. In the fall, we got discounts to the corn maze. This was by far our favorite CSA, with several pick ups around town, but ours was CY. http://www.jonesorchard.com/jones-orchard-CSA-information.htm  Other CSAs though this is not complete.

Walk into a flipping Starbucks while visiting home and saw this.  I didn't buy coffee, but I sure as hell bought that mug.  Typical.    They did a great job at incorporating everything that makes Memphis unique, and the colors are gorgeous.   Also, can someone please tell me what they think that propellor looking thing in front of the Pyramid is?  Other than a FedEx plane propellor, I'm thinking an iris for TN state flower?"

memphis,3dp80x,masterofmustaches,2,Sat Jul 18 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"^ those farmers markets (there's one on Winchester too!) are definitely your best bet as they have a huge variety of peppers.   Our climate here is wonderful for growing hot peppers! Try buying some seeds online and growing them yourself! Also, try growing cayenne and habanero next to each other.

memphis,3dn6cu,losthought,4,Sat Jul 18 03:07:03 2015 UTC,There are four main hospital systems in town:   Methodist Healthcare - largest hospital system in town Baptist Memorial Healthcare - second largest St. Francis Hospital (Tenet) - third largest and for profit Regional One Health - Level 1 Trauma Center for this region and not for profit   There are also several stand-alone medical imaging clinics in town and quite a few larger clinics that operate x-ray and CT equipment. Campbell Clinic does orthopaedics and they most certainly use x-ray extensively. Diagnostic Imaging is a standalone medical imaging clinic. Total Care Imaging is another standalone medical imaging shop that operates within one of the St. Francis campuses.  Reach out to the HR departments of these places directly. For the hospitals you might also do some research to find some contacts within the respective Radiology departments. Hope this helps!

At one time the Peabody hotel sold gym memberships if you lived downtown and they have a pool.  Rhodes college has an outdoor only pool that you can join for the summer along with the gym, but it kind of expensive.  The Nuber Y just outside the perimeter probably has the best options for what I suspect you are after.  The pool is large, open air in the summer and covered in the winter.

If you definitely don't have an opinion definitely put OXN in the drop down.  As a redditor and Memphis being community it would be so much if you voted for Oxn for 'Best Local Men's Clothing Store' for question 105.
memphis,3dedta,zacattac,6,Thu Jul 16 01:12:58 2015 UTC,Good lord man. 220 for jeans and 180 for a shirt?
memphis,3dedta,DebianSqueez,2,Thu Jul 16 11:19:37 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'm definitely used to that reaction. I know my stuff isn't for everyone. I tend to focus on quality, domestically made products. These products are made out of top notch fabrics and materials, and they are products that are made with their hands here in the States.  I looked at stores like Glasswing, Wheat & Co in Nashville, Old North in Asheville, Chrome Yellow Trading Co in Atlanta, and  Article in Cincinnati just to name a few to get inspiration. I realized that this type of store was missing in Memphis. We have James Davis and Oak Hall for more tailored, European, mass-produced brands, but we didn't have anything for the everyday man that cares about quality over quantity.  While it looks 'expensive' and 'ridiculous' I'd love for you to come in and I can show you the products and you can touch and see that it's not your standard jean from Kohl's."
memphis,3dedta,zacattac,3,Thu Jul 16 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"These products are made out of top notch fabrics and materials, and they are products that are made with their hands here in the States.   I know companies like Wheat & Co, as well as Old North use almost all imported Japanese fabrics, then assemble the clothing in southern Cali sweatshops using cheap immigrant labor, and call this ""Made in the USA"", then sell it at 1500% markup. (Article doesn't do this, and although their prices are a bit higher, their quality and social responsibility are outstanding.)  It looks good and makes buyers feel good, but is still essentially wrong and exploitative. Out of curiosity, what brands or manufacturers are you selling? I like your concept, but if it's using the same system as those other retailers, it isn't terribly economically or socially responsible.  *edit: Derp, checked your website, found brands. Apolis, for one, is pretty much all made in Peru, not the US. Several others are made in Honduras."

memphis,3dedta,unloose_the_moose,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you know some of the spots! Most of the companies that I dig get their fabric from Japan. They received our old shuttle looms from Levi's and started to produce very very high quality denim and cottons. Their dying process is often  completely different than how we do it here. We have Cone Mills in NC that makes denim, but that's the only selvedge/raw maker left in the states with the shuttle looms that they have to be made on.  For instance, Rogue Territory gets their denim from Japan Karl and Leslie employee 6 women in LA to create the product.  Apolis makes their fabric in Peru and constructs the products in LA. They also have the Bangladesh project. It employ's around 22-23 women at a fair-wage co-op in Bangladesh. The women make the jute fabric and then they send the fabric up to LA to make it in manufactures  that are based in certain cities.  Maybe the clothing industry as a whole isn't socially responsible? I mean, how much of Toms is marketing? Do we hear about who gets the glasses Warby Parker gives out?  While I do believe in these brands and the products and the people who make them, and now working in this industry I like to see that you can break your dollar down and see where it goes. I also like that the products last. I know this from experience with them before ever opening a store."

memphis,3dekhq,north_coaster,2,Wed Jul 15 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Like dodgeball said, it may be because of the owner but we had a lot of repair problems.  Our ceiling in the living room caved in from water damage and we lived with it for a month till we moved out.  They also didn't want give us our deposit back, citing the ceiling as our fault."
memphis,3dekhq,newandyoung,2,Thu Jul 16 03:00:40 2015 UTC,"Never rented a property from revid, but last year when we were looking they had an open house so we went by their office on Peabody to take a look at things. We didn't find anything worth our time so we left and began driving around looking for rent signs in yards. As we were driving through one midtown neighborhood we stopped and asked a security guard who was patrolling the area if there were any places he knew of for rent. He straight up told us not to rent from revid. Take that for what you will."
memphis,3dekhq,filthy_tiger,2,Thu Jul 16 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"We own 2 rental properties.  Revid manages one.  While they've been pretty good lately, we've had issues with them in the past.  The manager of the company was very rude to my husband when he called to discuss issues there.  They've done repairs higher than the $350 limit without prior permission from us.    This particular rental is owned by us and another couple.  The other couple has another house managed by REVID that they own 100%.  REVID screwed up and put the rent for BOTH houses in the account for the other couple's house.  When the mortgage company went to withdraw money for that month's mortgage on the joint house, there was not enough money in the account because REVID put the money in the wrong account.  My husband spent days trying to get it cleared up.  It was a total mess.  Finally, if that's not enough info, we know one a previous employee and one of the previous owners of the company.  And they've told some stories.  The company used to sell houses, as well as manage rentals.  There was a disagreement between the owner of the management side (the one who was rude to my husband) and the owner of the brokerage side.  So they split.  While I don't know the exact details, I understand there were some issues with bad customer service and the way the business was run.  I trust the person who told me this as they are a good friend.  Hope that info helps."
memphis,3dekhq,Celtic_Queen,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"I own 3 properties that I let Revid manage. They are excellent for the owner.  That said, I believe some of the blame that is laid on Revid could probably be the fault of the owner. I have an agreement with them to fix any repair under $250 without even bothering me about it. Anything else, they call me, I say yes and they fix the issue. If the owner doesn't have an agreement like that, repairs can be delayed.    Keep in mind that your repairs as a renter are completely paid for and you just need to wait for them to show. You are well within your rights to hire your own repair person and deal with it yourself. The free things in life are not always the fastest. When I signed on to let them manage my properties, one of the things they told me that stuck with me was that they try to groom their tenants to be home owners and encourage them to try to fix things as if it were their own - take that however you will.  They tend to get a horrible rep due to response times with repairs. I can't even count the number of charges I've incurred because my tenants never bothered to learn how to light a furnace or unclog a garbage disposal. If they're sending out crew after crew to do silly ""repairs"", the big stuff just gets placed in the queue.   I have had great tenants, shitty tenants and ""normal"" tenants. If you treat the home as your own, everybody wins; if you don't, the owner will jack up your monthly note or ask you to leave. One previous tenant (4 girls) cost me $4500 in repairs - they ripped off closet doors, knocked holes in walls and destroyed showers and tubs.  Also, the lady who was the property manager in previous years was let go (for being a haint or something) and the replacement is a pleasure to work with.   If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. I don't work for them, but I respect them on my end."
memphis,3dekhq,mphsDodgeball,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"When the property is back up for rent, do they charge you for mowing and maintenance between tenants or is that part of their responsibility?   I ask because they took over management of a house near us. When it is vacant during mowing season, they won't come out to address it unless code enforcement gets involved. In a sea of homes with mowed grass it probably makes their house that much harder to rent. It looks terrible. We have tried calling to let them know and they don't seem to care."
memphis,3dekhq,KnifehandHolsters,0,Thu Jul 16 10:31:06 2015 UTC,"My houses have only been vacant for days, not weeks and they renew in the winter so the mowing question is not one I know the answer to.  I do know that there is prep work involved in getting it back into shape and cleaning it up that the owner is charged for and while it is vacant you are responsible for paying for the utilities."

Wow.  That is seriously messed up.  Pay a premium well over mortgage cost to rent, build no equity, and be pressed to pay for/perform repairs to a house which the owner can take back at will at the end of any given lease?  No wonder they have such an awful rep.  I am also just kind of fuming over your referring to repairs in a rental as 'free' - there is a reason renters have to pay significantly more than a mortgage note for the same property would be, being built into the cost is not at all the same as being free."

It seems like the majority of those reviews were from years or months ago, with a few mediocre reviews the only ones coming from the past few months.  I'll keep both ends in mind."
memphis,3dekhq,probably_quite_drunk,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:22 2015 UTC,"If it helps, I was looking at properties just a couple of months ago, and decided to give Revid a second chance, since their office is in my neighborhood.  They tried to show me 3 properties.One had massive water damage and needed walls and flooring ripped out and replaced due to mold, but they just said ""It's fine, we'll lay some carpet over it, and you can move right in.""   Another still had people living there under a lease for 3 more months, but they assured me that I could have moved in within 2 weeks. I'm not sure what illegal fuckery that would have entailed, but I didn't believe them.  And the 3rd property they showed me was very nice but had a ""mistake"" in the listing in that it was $400 more than what their ad for it showed.  Overall, they're still a shitty business. But that's just 1 person's experience."
memphis,3dekhq,shoppedpixels,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"This is pretty spot on as an owner, I'm always knocking on wood that everything will be going smoothly. It really seems to depend on the tenants, some are very hands off and wind up with a bunch of service calls for things like changing the batteries in the thermostat and other mundane things. I don't think it's malicious or stupidity, just different types of people. Some are very hands off or cautious, ""What if I try and do this and break it and then get stuck with a bill or cause a larger repair"". I don't use Revid but I don't think there's too much of a difference in the way many handle things, our repair limit is $300 unless it's an emergency (negatives and furnace goes out or something).  OP it's like a franchise with even less control, I'm sure you've been to a nice McDonald's and a crappy one, the management company will have a bit more control  but really I think it's down to the property and the owner.   You can always go on the tax sites, find the owner's name of what you're interested in and then look up the other properties they own. You'll see if it's a single owner, guy with multiples, investment group etc. Larger entities might have other pressures besides keeping tenants via making them happy with repairs and such and repairs/attention could take longer for approval."

memphis,3dekhq,DreadfulRauw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"Revid is shady as fuck.  More than willing to screw over tenants.  Only rent from them if you have a good lawyer, and make sure to document everything."
memphis,3dekhq,Jessicasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope that you read this before you sign anything with Revid. I just finished my lease at the end of June and it honestly could not come quick enough. It was the worst experience I have ever had with a rental company. I'm going to try and give you bullet points so that this doesn't become a book.  -When we moved into our house the air-conditioning and the washing machine were broken. Also things they promised would be fixed before we moved in like broken drawers in the kitchen were not.  -Before I signed the lease I clarified that Revid was the one responsible for lawn care. They only did the lawn once we gave our notice that we were moving out.  -*********This one is important. When you sign your lease you agree to let Revid show the property to anyone they wish once they have your notice to move. This doesn't mean they walk around with the random stranger outside. They bring random strangers into your home and show them every single room with all of your stuff there. They showed our house over and over for 2 months whether or not we were in the house. This means if you are having a birthday party that Revid with random future renter will be there to crash your party. I asked if it was possible for them not to show the bedrooms in order to respect our privacy but they said they had a right to show anything. So if anyone wants to rob you they can come scout out your house with Revid first.  -When we moved out we had a feeling they would try to screw us over on our security deposit and we were right. They charged us $150 for carpet cleaning which was ridiculous because when we moved in it was disgusting so I rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned it myself. We left the carpet in better condition than we got it.  -Please do not rent from them. It was the worst experience I have ever had with renting. There were many other things but this is the highlight.  Go with a company like MTC property management, Rosecrest apts, or someone else. If you have questions please message me. I'm more than happy to prevent someone else going through the same stuff we did."
memphis,3dekhq,Jessicasa,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/Jessicasa! My roommate and I actually found a different property, with better pricing/amenities than any of Revid's offerings.  Though we were this |=> | close to renting an apartment that we had an application in a week ago; the other day I visited the apartment again, talked to the agent about what I was going to do next (get my roommate's app in) and before the end of the day the unit was rented, with no notification. -.- If I hadn't called them the first thing the next morning, I would have had no idea...  It's quite unfortunate Revid is such trash, considering they manage a lot of units in great locations. I'm sorry you had that experience and I'm glad you're out of it.  Cheers!"

There's also a lot of hogwash about how the KKK under Forrest was a benevolent, protective organization, but it was violent and sometimes murderous from the very beginning, although you can't necessarily pin the blame for the specific crime on Forrest since everyone hid their faces."

He was later cleared of those war crimes I do believe.  If you are looking for a General to hate on look no further than Sherman.  He raped and burned his way across the entire south yet he is still thought of as a hero.
memphis,3d4wqc,unloose_the_moose,4,Mon Jul 13 18:23:24 2015 UTC,it looks like that propaganda is still doing it's job today. I just thought that Tennessee having a Forrest day was really ironic juxtaposed to the current events that are happening in Memphis.
memphis,3d4wqc,GenLloyd,-4,Mon Jul 13 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"Once the propaganda is out there it can sometimes be taken as fact versus what it truly is.

memphis,3d2nji,RuddyBollocks,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:51 2015 UTC,"one of my coworkers mentioned going there to get their knives sharpened.  i haven't tried it, but i gather that basic idea is like u said, a good option for any cheap knives you own but not the best idea if u own any expensive knives.    if the edge comes out rough, a possible option is using one of those handheld sharpeners, which are intended more to remove rough edges than actually sharpen a knife anyway.  also, using learning how to use a honing steel and a sharpening stone properly is probably ideal for any cooks that do have expensive knives or generally invest in their kitchen ware. like they say, give a man a fish, so on.  youtube?"
memphis,3d2nji,krimsonmedic,2,Mon Jul 13 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"I do need to get my own sharpener. I had gotten the Victorinox and Wusthoff knives for Mother's Day, so haven't really had time to get them too dull yet. It's amazing how a good knife can improve cooking, but even the cheaper set I had sharpened seem better than brand new after a good sharpening."

memphis,3d2nji,PMsomething,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"That is pretty standard for high-end knives, but most people who care enough to invest hundreds/thousands of dollars in a nice set don't like periodically going weeks without them just to have them sharpened."

I use a couple of my favorite Wusthofs every day, but I don't have any particular interest in spending another couple hundred on each one just so I can have an extra around.  And why would I invest in nice knives if I didn't mind using a cheap spare for a couple of weeks every few months (at the very least) just to keep them sharp?    Think about it another way, why do you think sharpening services are popular enough to have standalone storefronts and busy booths at farmer's markets and such, when essentially all of those customers have the option of sending the knives back to the manufacturer instead?"

Anybody can wreck a knife edge using a grindstone so that it feels sharp but isn't. Seems like every flea market I've ever been to has at least one such guy. These guys don't actually get a sharp edge, they get a jagged edge which tears instead of cuts. So it feels really sharp to the touch but is worthless for cooking and will always fail the paper test. Sounds like this might be what you got at A1."

memphis,3d2x5c,gripandahalf,3,Mon Jul 13 02:31:12 2015 UTC,I live in MS and got mine at Red Square Market in Hernando. I believe Butchers Block in Southaven also has them.  I do know that the Kroger in Southaven normally carries them. The points are a little small on them but they are USDA Choice Angus briskets. I've cooked one of those before and it turned out good though I did trim a bit of fat off.
memphis,3d2x5c,roguekerbal,3,Mon Jul 13 13:35:19 2015 UTC,Claybrook Farms and Donnell(sp?) at the downtown farmers market have good stuff. Pricey though. Charlie's Meat Market on Summer might have something of good quality as well.
memphis,3d2x5c,MooseAndSquirrel,3,Mon Jul 13 02:40:20 2015 UTC,Check out superlo on Spottswood and Colonial. They usually have full packers that don't need a ton of fat-trimming. They're prices are comparable to Kroger.
memphis,3d2x5c,SurpriseButtStuff,4,Mon Jul 13 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"The cheapest around is usually Restaurant Depot, but you have to be a member to shop there - it's free to join as long as you belong to a non profit (school, church, etc) or have a food resale certificate. I faked it by creating an LLC and paying for the resale cert.   Costco and Sam's are decent prices, they're just fatty, but I usually trim over a third of the full packer brisket off before I cook it.  For higher end beef, Charlies on summer is the best quality usually. Ramons on getwell has them, but they don't stock too many. Give Kerry at Ramons a few weeks notice and he can order you one from Chicago Meat Authority."
memphis,3d2x5c,mphsDodgeball,2,Mon Jul 13 02:40:49 2015 UTC,Costco doesn't usually have full packers. They usually only have flats.   RD is probably the best bet. I've loved their briskets when I've smoked them. Good quality and good marbling.

memphis,3cyu19,Cornballin_POS,3,Sun Jul 12 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"To me the best BBQ in Memphis is an even split between Corky's and Central for overall quality.  I like Central better for pork and for ribs, and for odds and ends as well. But Corky's beef brisket is WAY better (and I way prefer beef brisket over pork...I grew up in Texas; sue me). And Corky's fries are tons better; they are so yummy and they melt in your mouth.  Plus Corky's has that Italian spaghetti side that's so awesome, and their chocolate fudge pie is hard to beat. And yeah, I love the drive-through. I really don't know why folks beat up on Corky's; I prefer it.    Folks have this same attitude about Rendevous...despite me being a huge fan of BBQ, folks have said it's ""so overrated"" and ""mainly for the tourists"" to me ever since I got to this town, and so I've skipped it all along.  Well, the missus and I finally tried it about a month ago, after being nearby for an Orpheum show and wanting to grab dinner afterwards.  You know what?  We were bowled over, it was so good.  I don't understand what folks are complaining about.    Meanwhile, people praise Germantown Commissary to the skies, and to me it's all just average, maybe a bit above average but nothing to recommend people go out of their way for.    You know what IS worth going out of your way for?  Paynes BBQ on Lamar.  GREAT food, truly unique (and scrumptious) taste.    I have a good friend who lived right near Jerry's Sno Cones for many years, and I was over at his place all the time, and somehow I never made it to Jerry's.  Haven't had the pleasure yet.  I guess I need to fix that."

I love helping people get started. (not a personal trainer and no I'm not charging lol).  I'm 24 and she's 28, the friends that occasionally come are 31.  IF you're a woman, my wife is a transplant from Indiana so she only has a few friends. I'm sure she would love to hang out.  If you're a dude... well... I'd say you could hang out with me.. but that would consist of coming to work with me since I work every day of the week. I do play video games in the mornings from 9-11am."

memphis,3cxz3z,aca901,3,Sat Jul 11 20:19:58 2015 UTC,I've found that the Hernando farmers market has better prices than the the one downtown. Great selection. The obvious downside is that you have to get up and drive to Hernando on Saturday morning but the produce is worth it.
memphis,3cxz3z,filthpig,2,Sat Jul 11 20:47:31 2015 UTC,Easy Way is a good choice. Kroger and the larger stores will probably have the best prices.
memphis,3cxz3z,NaturalGnomad,3,Sun Jul 12 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"Wife and I are plant-based - we eat a lot of fruit.  Ideal order of shopping:  1) Local farmer's market (downtown / cooper young / cordova) - Look into a CSA with one of the farmers. Jones Orchard was our favorite as it was more fruit intensive.  2) Easy Way (which during season is as close to a local farmer's market as you can get)  3) Winchester Farmers Market (or Cordova Farmers Market, but Winchester is bigger) - This is an international supermarket, not a fresh farmers market. It has the widest selection of produce in Memphis (still don't know what half of it is). It's also great for buying in bulk (we buy 120 lbs of bananas/week @ $19.99 for 40 lbs).  4) Palazola's produce off summer. You can only buy in bulk, but they are the suppliers for Kroger so you can cut out the middle man. Wouldn't mind sharing on some things that are harder to consume before going bad.  5) Kroger"

Today, we had raw banana pancakes that were fantastic (see FB link below). Bananas are quite versatile.  Everyday we EACH have about 12-15 bananas for breakfast blended with water + whatever else we choose like today was 1 lb strawberries. There are approximate 70 bananas per 40 lb box, so we go through them quickly. My wife will do 30/day every once in a while as a reset button.  Eating this way, I lost 50 lbs, decided to start running to expel the energy, cleaned up acne, etc. My wife lost 35, reduced inflammation to help with pain (another story), quit smoking, etc. We're both in the best shape we've ever been in. We've learned a ton and love to share about how a plant-based (or at least plant-rich) diet is the healthiest.  I'm not trying to hijack the thread, but feel free to AMA.

In essence, you just take some leftover sticky rice and mix it with diced veggies of your choosing. We used onions, peppers, mushrooms, and some carrots. I think the mix was about 50/50 rice to veggie. Mix in a bowl with seasonings. Flatten into patties and grill. Like I said, this concept can be easily modified to whatever flavors you enjoy.  I will share the video in a few weeks, but a new one just took priority - BBQ jackfruit. It's just like BBQ pulled pork and was amazing."

Hackett annexed them and Herenton wasn't a chance anyway.   It is a pretty wild theory involving him, but when you look at all the events leading to that election, his involvement as a spoiler seems rather plausible. If not strategic.

I've heard the public schools are not the best, or are average anyways.   I really like what I've seen of Atoka, which would be about 20 minutes away from Millington, in the direction opposite Memphis. If you're looking for something more to the rural side, that would be my suggestion.  I lived just outside Millington for about a year.

I've lived in Memphis my whole life and love it. Not overtly fond of Millington, just not a small town kind of person, but I know a lot of people like that kind of thing. The McD's is surprisingly nice. I don't know much about the schools there for little kids, but Southwest Community College has a campus up there, and you can always make the drive to the much more highly recommended University of Memphis. I didn't like SWCC when I was dual-enrolled in high school, but I've heard good things about their improvements in the last decade. The University of Memphis, however, is lovely in my four years of experience there. My cousin lived in Millington, used my father's house in Cordova as a sort of operating/studying/napping base, and went to school at U of M. He did okay, I guess. I had the luxury of living close to the university, so my commute was less hectic than his.  But, while my view as a non-military-member is entirely subjective, Millington itself sucks ass. Not a whole lot of fun things to do that I have found having gone up there once or twice a week for the last few months, not my kind of people (I'm a young, poor, Cooper Young kind of guy), and not my kind of scene. But your mileage may vary. My definition of fun and yours could be extremely different.  But if you're really not bothered by bugs, humidity, and the kind of religiosity that only small-town TN can provide, you'll probably be fine. Bartlett/Cordova may be a nice cultural and geographical middle ground between Memphis and Millington if you're looking to make both of those places as accessible as possible for your job and schooling.  Added a few things in edits."

memphis,3cmb3q,XPTB,9,Thu Jul 9 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked in a fairly high agency in CC. I never observed deliberate traffic shaping.  ALL customers information in wrapped into a custom firmware (bootfile) and provisioned onto the modem. This firmware is 100% dependent on the codes in your billing account. If you have ""xyz"" package that you pay for then on the back end your account is flagged with that data. When you plug in your modem or call up and it says ""would you like to send a refresh signal?"" what its doing is running the codes on your account and sending a proper firmware to the modem.  If these codes are changed by a agent, say you have xyz package but a agent has not properly set it up or someone were to try to lower the bandwidth, your modem will actually not function at all due to a mismatch.  When you call in for technical support and they typically say they are going to reset it remotely this is a ""auto provision attempt"" which makes sure the modem config matches what you pay for. Theres various reasons why this will fix many common issues that I wont get into. A comcast rep is actually unable to open a ticket or support issue if the modem is not matching what you pay for, not by some comcast rule but the system itself.  The modem config tells the node (green box on the street) how to treat you.   This is all software based, so you will often see speeds over what you subscribe sometimes rather than having a fixed port cap.  In terms of your situation. It is true that support is limited with personal equiptment, with 30 million subscribers you would be surprised how often people think CC provides support for a variety of things. CC gives you a connection to the internet and thats it. Tools provide extremely extensive diagnostics, testing and logging for customers modems. Generally if there is a problem that needs to be addressed they will catch it further trouble shoot.  Though not related to you some comcast modems such as the older Technicolors do not like VPNs at all, a lot of these types of issues are vendor bugs and firmware issues.  I would suggest doing some further testing. Personally my steps would be, the first few seem silly since you achieve your bandwidth outside of steam but still try.  1) On the back of your modem, hold in the reset button or pinhole for 30 seconds to have comcast resend the proper firmware,boot file  2) Plug device directly into modem bypassing all other equiptment. Is there a change in your bandwidth?  3) Assuming the cable is tighly screwed in to the modem and wall. Is there a cable splitter in between the wall and modem, splitters go bad all the time and or weak signals from the cable can be choked at the splitter. Try plugging directly into wall.  4) Check Steam > Settings > Download and see what ""Region"" is selected and verify there is no bandwidth limit in steam download settings.  From there I would consider the following:  Check and make sure the disk on your computer (where the steam library folder is) is not having issues with i/o or waiting to write to the disk.  If you have not changed the egress region in your download settings try playing with that and selecting a few locations geographically close and perhaps a few that are further.  The reason you may see a fluctuation with or without the VPN is likely more of a routing issue. Without the VPN if you contact xyz server located in x datacenter your traffic may route to that server differently than with the VPN and the VPNs servers may have a closer path to the steam location you choose.  There could also be other issues at play related to routing such as a fiber cut somewhere and normal traffic is being sent on a different path etc etc.  You could try running a traceroute to the various steam egress servers/regions and see if theres anything strange going on.   I can only download at 2.5 MB/s capped   This amounts to 20Mbps (5Mbps less than your old plan)   VPN tunnel. I noticed steam was now downloading at 4.1 MB/s    About 30Mbps (5 higher than your old cap 20 under the new one)  Any other data being used at the same time? both up or down will effect. Memphis is also a data capped region, login to the website to check if you have gone over.  You can call up CC and ask specifically for a ""health check"" to see what they say, if anything shows degraded they may send someone out or tell you to replace your owned modem. Though typically in a situation where 1 thing is having less than desirable bandwidth but other devices/tests in the network are OK, its a software issue, routing, or server issue with the client. Call in the mornings or early afternoons, as evening our time it tends to switch to the transcom centers overseas.  You will NOT get to a higher tier of support since you own your equiptment, if you do by manipulating the IVR when calling they will most likely reject the call."

memphis,3cmb3q,tri_it,4,Thu Jul 9 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly it is Comcast especially since the VPN should be slower by its very nature.

I wish the sources would be gathered specifically addressing the arguments presented by Lee Millar in the WREG.com ""Sons of Confederate Veterans Try To Save Their Heritage"" video.  He says that Forest was not a leader, member or even associated with the Klan per a US Congressional Investigation in 1871 (from my cursory understanding, this wasn't a finding but simply Forest's own response to a discovery request).  Millar says there were 3 KKK instances in America and the first was principally trying to restore law and order and help white and blacks alike.  I have seen a great many sources that indicate otherwise.  Finally, that Forest was actually a civil rights leader and that 3,000 blacks attended his funeral, which is addressed by beardyman901's source and in it's comments.  However, more sources would be useful.   There is still a Nathan Bedford Forest State Park, and the governor is already against Nathan Bedford Forest being glorified in the State of Tennessee.

memphis,3cj1ca,workaccount38103,10,Thu Jul 9 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Really this comes from Republican Governor Bill Haslam expressing that he wanted the Nathan Bedford Forest bust statue removed from the State Capitol in Nashville.  That sentiment was taken up here in Memphis immediately thereafter with our even more visibly located statue of Forest.   I think one grievance was that history would be destroyed.  I like the move because history will be preserved, but more appropriately placed.  We don't need this in the middle of the high-growth, nationally recognized medical district, and next to one of our biggest tourist draws, Sun Studios.  I have heard of prospective medical students being swayed away from Memphis because of the first KKK Grand Wizard history of the statue there, even if Forest did reform in his final years.  Some people who idolize Forest are less reformed than Forest himself is thought to have been in his later years.  Apparently, the funding will not come from taxes, I'd imagine even an intern could conduct a successful private fundraiser for this.  I would tend to think critics of AC Wharton would be pleased that the only cost would be to his time -- time they would prefer him not to be spending on anything else, or much of anything at all."

memphis,3cj1ca,reasondefies,0,Wed Jul 8 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"You're correct, Andrew Jackson signed the order for the trail of tears, and that is an ugly, reprehensible thing just as being a KKK Grand Wizard is ugly.  However, that act is not society's general thought when they think of Jackson.  He had many noted actions that overshadow that, such as helping found the State of Tennessee and becoming a President.  Forest had no actions of that particular magnitude that weigh into what he symbolizes, which has come to be his role as KKK Grand Wizard among anti-racists who hate what he symbolizes, and among the racists who support his worst deeds and views.   Also, there is currently a climate of conflict involving black people in the US.  Many people feel they are victims of black people right now.  When I observe many US conservative sources, they often explain exactly how they, and their group, are victims of black people in particular.  Even your comment, asking is it only ""when it's black people"", reflects that view.  Of course, black people have reasons for feeling a victim as well, I'm sure you're aware, although many seem to believe their reasons are not valid.  Overall, whatever your view, the conflict exists, and there is no conflict with Native Americans at this time that is as strong.  This is why what Forest stands for is more relevant at this time.   Relocating, but not destroying his statue, does still keep this awful chapter in our history in the history books.   It also places the ugliness he has come to symbolize somewhere more appropriate, we don't have to have a symbol of depravity right in the center of an area that is about to receive more investment than virtually any other prospective area in Memphis.  TL;DR.  This doesn't destroy history, it takes a particularly foul symbol that relates to a modern conflict out of an area that's receiving hundreds of millions of investment and is growing, increasing the city's potential."
memphis,3cj1ca,jk3us,0,Wed Jul 8 15:12:19 2015 UTC,"I understand, you're not from the south and it seems to you that I'm saying if any group complains, we should react.  I'm sure if I were you, I'd feel the exact same way.  Forest isn't just another confederate leader.  Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam is from the south, and wanted Forest's bust out of the State Capitol, but he didn't want the busts of other confederate leaders out.  He went after this confederate in particular, not every confederate, and I understand research at a distance, and certainly no research at all, may not give a clear understanding of why he felt that way.  There is more to this particular  story than Forest being just another confederate leader.  Whether it should stay or go is a matter of opinion, so yes, there is subjectivity to this.  I did mention some things that virtually anyone would recognize as fact.  For example, if anyone polled Americans, I'm sure they would find the conflict sentiment involving black people to be higher than that current sentiment with Native Americans.  I'm sure any such poll would show little association of Andrew Jackson with the Trail of Tears, and especially as compared with other things he symbolizes.  Also, it is a fact that relocating that statue does not remove Forest from history, as many seem to say.  These are not subjective, or at least much less subjective elements of what I said.  I have a love for Mount Rushmore and this country, as a previous member of the US Army infantry.  Maybe you've put your life on the line for this country as well?  Those men are much different symbols than Nathan Bedford Forest, and a comparison or hypothetical seem reactionary and disingenuous to me.  I'm sure some radical person could use that hypothetical to say the Saddam Hussein statue should have remained, reducing it to say it all stemmed from some people complaining."
memphis,3cj1ca,slamball,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"Forest put his life on the line against his country.  Rebelled, seceded from it, literally polar opposite.  Treason, traitor.  I am actually part Native American, and I would think a poll of  Native Americans would show they would not view their own current climate of conflict as surging as high as that involving black people right now.    I also would be surprised if Native Americans had statues of Andrew Jackson on the reservations, and if they do and wanted it moved, I actually would understand them wanting to relocate it.  As you may be aware, Memphis is predominately black.  I've made a pretty good and clear statement here, and I think you'd truly do well to reconsider your thinking, down to your heart.

memphis,3cizx5,Cital001,3,Wed Jul 8 07:47:33 2015 UTC,"So I just recently moved into a new house and was exploring what options we had for internet.  It basically came down to either ATT UVerse or Comcast (I think Verizon FIOS would be an option, but I didn't really consider it).  ATT's offer that I was considering was 18 mpbs for $45 a month for 12 months, then up to $60-something after that. They don't let you use your own equipment, which tacks on an extra $7/month, and they have a 250GB monthly cap.   Comcast (at the time, about a month ago) had an offer of 25 mpbs for $30/month (if you enroll in paperless billing, otherwise it's $35/month, then goes up to the $60something/month after 18 months) and they let you use your own modem/router which saves you that monthly charge. Like /u/DrRobertKelso mentioned, they do have a 300GB monthly limit.  I chose Comcast, and right off the bat, the customer service was horrible. The day we moved in, a technician came out and stood outside for like 10 minutes and told me that he would have to place a work order for our cable lines to be buried (come to find out, our cable lines are actually aerial), and he told me that they should call me within a couple hours  to schedule the appointment.   Well, they never called, and when I wound up calling into customer service a couple days later, apparently the service had already been scheduled (without my approval or anything) for a date 2 weeks away, not to mention on a date that I wouldn't be in town.  Anyways, we decide to wait it out and just live without internet for a few weeks, can't be that bad.  Then they day comes when another technician is came out to activate the internet connection. I tell him the situation, he goes outside, looks around, and tells me that he can get it all hooked up. He then tells me that the first technician probably saw that we had cables up on a telephone pole and was too lazy/didn't care enough to climb the pole and just made up some crap to tell us so that he could leave.   TL;DR: Everyone knows Comcast customer service is utter shit, but you get higher speeds at lower prices, with a higher data cap to boot. So, yeah, Comcast is probably your best choice, as much as it sucks."

From the day of the install, they sent 3-4 techs, but there was a lead tech from start to finish and he didn't leave until it worked and I was happy. I've had one outage that I can remember, and it was a nationwide outage for a couple hours. I actually get more than my subscribed speed. I pay for 12Mbps, usually experience 15-18.

Blows my mind.  I had cable + internet and recently decided to cut the cord for cable.. physically went to a Comcast location and canceled cable, the lady got me a good deal on Internet (2nd highest speed, $50/mo with no rise in price - within the near future that I'm aware of). She didn't berate me for canceling part of my service, which is what most of the phone operators do nowadays.

memphis,3cif8y,memphis_dude,4,Wed Jul 8 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"My wife and I were visitors there when it was open (both as City Hall, and prior to that when it was Stella Marris).  It was okay as a nightclub; nothing special.  Yep, it looked kinda cool inside.  But the looks didn't seem to matter much.    We had been going there semi-regularly to eat when Ronnie Grisanti's Italian Restaurant was located there for a while.  Ronnie always has awesome food (we've been eating at his various places for roughly 20 years!), and we would eat then drink/club.    After Ronnie relocated his restaurant to the back of the Sheffield Antique Mall in Collierville, the Cordova club soon changed from Stella Marris to City Hall, and my wife and I still visited for a bit...but then we realized that it wasn't so hot after all, and that we had really been there for the food.  I think others realized it as well: there was never THAT much of a crowd to begin with, and it got to be thinner and thinner very quickly. We got friends to go with us a couple times, but then didn't want to go back. We stopped going.  At some point we realized they had closed their doors.    I didn't even realize they were saying anything about being closed ""to have new lighting installed""; I just figured they were shut down with no plans to reopen, due to poor business.  This is the same place where Cordova residents had expressed concern (ever since it was being built, IIRC) that it would turn into a strip joint, because the guy building it - Steve Cooper - was known for his strip clubs around town.  I don't know if that's still a concern for residents ever since Shelby County enacted the super-prude laws turning strip clubs into bikini bars.  But I was driving by there just last night, and there's some construction appearing to be getting underway behind a chain link fence on the corner IN FRONT of City Hall/Stella Marris, along Germantown Parkway itself. Like, a big enough area to be a new strip shopping center, or something like that. So I'm wondering if pretty soon you may not even be able to see the City Hall/Stella Marris building from along GTown Pky.    EDIT: I just got the idea to do a search for ""Germantown Parkway at Fischer Steel Road,"" and I quickly hit upon this article from 2 months ago showing that 2 parcels of land there - one previously owned by Steve Cooper's ""Insomnia Inc."" firm - had been bought through Marketplace Monroe LLC, which a separate lookup shows that they make deals for strip shopping centers anchored by grocery supermarkets.  And this April article in MBJ says the same (even mentions its all adjacent to the City Hall club!), but also points out that the developers want the land to be used in a way that ties in with the new Ikea and the new Cheesecake Factory that are in-the-works a bit farther north on Germantown Parkway.  So no, my guess is that the City Hall Nightclub is never going to reopen, at least in its current form (it's been closed since March 27, 2013, according to its Facebook page).  It might even possibly get knocked down and the property reused for something else, if nothing else happens with the building in its current form.    EDIT 2: My wife just wondered aloud whether this could possibly be the spot where Trader Joe's is going to come to town.  Interesting theory!  She reminding me that we also noticed last night that on the other side of Germantown Road, just north of the shopping strip containing Zaxby's/Flying Saucer/Jet's Pizza/Danvers (so in the 1400-ish block of N. Germantown Parkway), there is a newly-cleared (previously had trees) parcel of land that is getting ready for construction.  So something - Trader Joe's or whatever - could be going in there, too.    EDIT 3: Nah, the property at 1427 N. Germantown Pkwy seems to be just another small strip shopping center (see here), with no room for something big like a grocery store.  And the property at 725/789 N. Germantown Pkwy (in front of the City Hall Club) is plenty big for a grocery store.  Moreover, that's almost right across the street from the Kroger at Trinity Commons, so unless it's one of the Super-Kroger stores that are being put in all over town, then it's a Whole Foods or a Fresh Market or maybe the rumored Trader Joe's."

memphis,3cif8y,Dear_Occupant,3,Wed Jul 8 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a pretty badass job. How'd you end up with that gig?   LOL, here's the shortest version of the story I'm able to explain with any kind of detail whatsoever:  One day in 2001, I'm in a discussion on a home theater-themed message board about all the different shows they've ever made about Scooby-Doo.  Prior to that, this guy up in Canada was bored one day and decided to make a website that would track which TV-DVDs were released, and track user votes for which shows they wanted to see released on DVDs. ""Is YOUR Favorite TV Show On DVD?"" was (and is) the site slogan.    He PMed me through the message board and said he saw my posts, like Scooby-Doo, and asked if I would beta test his new site, because I know so much about TV shows, and because I'm deep into DVDs, and because I've mentioned that my job (at the time) was System Analyst (so I knew what to look for).  I tested it, gave him a long list of problems and issues I found, and he fixed every darn one of them.  Brilliantly, too.    So I hung around after the site went live on 11/1/2001, and I kept emailing him tips (""here's something I found on Amazon that you didn't post news about yet"" or ""another DVD news site mentioned this item today"").  One day I sent in a tip with news for him to post, and he responded back, ""YOU post it; you're the News Director now...here's your admin username and password, and your email address.""  He and I ran the site, in our spare time, for zero income (other than the small amount of ad fees he got, used to offset server costs), while each of us had full-time jobs.  I had a wife and a kid; he was in the process of falling in love and getting married (they have a kid together now, too).    One day in 2007, he told me that TV Guide had just bought the site.  And that from then on, we would both be getting paid (as contractors) to do the same thing we had always done.  Not a whole bunch, and still just part time, but comparable to what I was making at the job I had been doing...enough to pay the bills.  Also, he took a nice chunk of the money TV Guide paid him, and sent me a check as a thank you for making the site so successful over the years leading up to the sale (he also later on paid all the bills insurance didn't cover when my son had to spend a week in LeBonheur for a burst appendix one summer).  So I quit that other job, and now for the past 8 years I've worked from my living room.    That commute from the bed to the couch every day is a killer.  ;)  But yeah, TL;DR: I got super lucky, all thanks to Scooby-Doo."

But they apparently also own the Discount Tire chain, so I imagine that's what's going in there, because it appears to be too small a piece of land to put an office building or much of anything else on.  It also doesn't show up in the ""new projects"" portfolio on the development company's web site, as it probably would if they were planning to rent out the space.

They (and Whole Foods, and Fresh Market) aren't anywhere in my immediate neighborhood (Southwind) at all.  Though Sprouts is closest, being 2-3 freeway exits and then a long trip up Forest-Hill Irene away from me.  I've made it into Whole Foods by Paradiso Malco a few times, but not since after they moved in the spot where the office supply store used to be.  Meanwhile, tons closer I've got Costco, 2 Krogers, an Aldi, a Walmart superstore, a Walmart neighborhood store, a VH Foods, a Superlo, and the Winchester Farmers Market. I shop at any of those, depending on what I need/want, and which direction I'm going in that day for other stuff. There's a Sam's Club nearby, but I'm not a member. I think there might also be a Save-a-Lot nearby, too; I forget.  Not to mention a few bodegas, and a bunch of other smaller ethnic-themed grocery stores (Indian, Asian, Mediterranean, etc.).    If and when Trader Joe's ever comes to town, I expect we'll pop in once just to see what all the fuss was about, but I will probably never give it a second thought beyond that.  I have no idea why people think it's a holy grail of any sort.  For all we know, Safeway, Albertson's, Lion King Food Lion, or Winn Dixie could be coming to town, too! Just speculating. :)    But it's probably just another Super Kroger. After all, they don't have one otherwise available for the area, right?  The closest one will be the location they're (still!) building on Farmington Road, between the end of S. Germantown Parkway and Exeter.  And that ain't all that close.

Now we have to go back there almost every time we drive through the area.

That will be fairly close to you.   Was it not open yet?  I have a friend who works in that area, and she told me when they began to build it.  It seems so long ago now, that I figured it was already opened.  But I don't make it out in that direction very often.    The Whole Foods going in near Poplar and Exeter is no closer to me in driving time than the Sprouts would be.  Roughly a 15 minute drive, and more during peak traffic times.  Which wouldn't be totally awful, except I've got 7 supermarkets literally within 5 minutes of home, and at least 2 more (and next to each other, too!) in the less-than-10-minute range. :)    That Poplar-near-Exeter location of Whole Foods isn't going to tempt me much, anyway.  I'm near the existing location (by the Malco Paradiso theater) often enough but am not tempted to go in.  I guess it doesn't have the same appeal to me (or my wife, or kid for that matter) that it does to others.  My wife's best friend likes to visit it, but only for a few select things.    Honestly, the Super Kroger going in on Farmington near Exeter, a block down from the new Whole Foods, is likely to see a lot more of me.  I drive in that direction for other reasons a lot more often than I do in the direction of Sprouts, so I might bop in and see what they have which the two Krogers near me aren't large enough to carry.

memphis,3cclb1,workaccount38103,4,Tue Jul 7 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"The zipper method is better because it provides an explicit, unwavering place to merge into the other lane. This allows traffic to maintain a constant or slowly slowing speed all the way to the merge point. This helps during times of congestion.  The early merge method requires all drivers to see the first signs warning of a lane shift. If drivers do not notice this, the flow in the early merge immediately degrades as drivers in the soon-to-be ending lane must slow down and attempt to merge should cars in the other lane allow it. In times of congestion this slows down all lanes of traffic."

He's a big supporter of Net Neutrality and it's a good idea to let him know what's going on with his constituents. I believe he is also a Comcast subscriber himself, so this issue affects him personally.  If you live in the Poplar Corridor area you should send it to Stephen Fincher instead.

Unless you get to Tom Lee park super early too and stay put then you'll be fine. It's an awesome show they put on and lasts at least 45 mins if I remember correctly.

I would actually be for a rule against linking paywalled articles period (or at the very least a tag), since they are frustrating for everyone that doesn't have a subscription. At least that way we get to protest the sites that do that."
memphis,3bx2tl,damn_this_is_hard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:50:26 2015 UTC,We can add a tag for sure so people know.
memphis,3bx2tl,damn_this_is_hard,18,Fri Jul 3 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Paywall news articles is one of the dumbest things I've ever had to deal with. Put up ads and surveys, Google has a program for sites like this too, anything but a paywall. You want people to care about their city? How can they if the local news can't even get it to them. Smh  News should not have to be paid for to be consumed, isn't one of the purposes of journalism to keep the public informed?  EDIT: Can we make the rules so that paywall articles can be posted with a summary or paraphrase and then the link to read it all fully behind the paywall? This would make the posts be self posts so no one can reap the sweet karma from the CA's hard investigative journalism"
memphis,3bx2tl,jk3us,0,Fri Jul 3 06:30:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Which is why I suggested ads for them. Obviously they are concerned advertising won't pay enough, but if they produce quality info and can get it to people, they'll have a whole lot more visitors to their articles and in turn, more dollars from those views. The paywall model is garbage, why would I wanna pay to read your content just off a few headlines?"
memphis,3bx2tl,jk3us,2,Sat Jul 4 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I understand the sentiment. I believe information should be free hardcore.  However, that's not what the Commercial Appeal is doing, and this isn't how you go about it. It's not the writers' fault that the publishing company is enforcing a paywall, and they're the ones who get hurt by (corporate) media companies who enact paywalls."
memphis,3bx2tl,jk3us,6,Sat Jul 4 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Know how we get that to change? Stop using the services altogether and/or contact the publisher.  I agree with you! Paywalls don't work. They're dumb. The CA is not going to make money with paywalls.  But we can't just sit here, copy and paste copyrighted material, and act like we are doing something for the greater good.  There's nothing to vote on. Copyright material is copyright material, and at the very least it's unethical to allow it here."
memphis,3bx2tl,damn_this_is_hard,4,Fri Jul 3 08:25:24 2015 UTC,"I think we all agree paywalls are dumb. But I would also point out that the important part of a news article can usually be summarized in a couple of sentences...

memphis,3bx2tl,Jakelshark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:11:53 2015 UTC,"For physical items, yes, that's a bit different.  For intellectual content, that's an entirely different story. Copyright law does not allow the ownership of intellectual content just because you purchase access to it."

If the worry is about ownership, has anyone who has posted these articles claimed ownership of the article? Also what about the 'fair use' aspect?   Not to be condescending, but I think this should still be discussed/debated."
memphis,3bx2tl,damn_this_is_hard,2,Fri Jul 3 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"You're not being condescending.  The worry isn't ownership. I don't think anyone is seeing an article that's been copied and pasted and said, ""Oh okay, it's alexandrathegr8's story."" It's redistributing copyrighted content, and at the very least it's unethical, because it's taking away hits from the website, which is how journalists are increasingly being measured on their work (because ads).  At the end of every Commercial Appeal article, it says: ""Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.""  Fair use doesn't allow for entire work to be copied. The less percentage of work shared, the more likely it is to be fair use."

So, if the content creator is ok with it, doesn't that make it ok? (ethically speaking, not copyright speaking)"
memphis,3bx2tl,damn_this_is_hard,3,Fri Jul 10 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"As much as I appreciate the anecdotal evidence, as a journalist myself, I know that our jobs are currently being measured on how many hits we're getting (because, ultimately, it's easier to get that data than from a print version).  At the end of the day, I just want people to read my stories, which, sure, can include sharing it around via copy/paste.  But it's still unethical, no matter how many journalists tell you that they're OK with it. The content is not ultimately theirs, it's the publication's."
memphis,3bx2tl,Mempin,4,Fri Jul 10 17:47:41 2015 UTC,It's crazy how many people feel entitled to free content because they disagree with a company's business practices.

Sure, CA is hanging on with the baby boomers still subbed, but once they die, the paper will be done.   I can go and read articles by nationally acclaimed writers for free. Take the sub I see you on for instance - r/nba, I can go read Zach Lowe's and Bill Simmon's articles for free. I am not going to pay for Chris Herrington, who is nowhere near as good as the other two guys. He's a talented writer, but Zach Lowe writes the same things he does with less hot air and hubris.   I also don't feel entitled to the works of writers on the CA, I just don't care to read their publications if they're charging for them. It's less about entitlement. The whole way news is doled out is changing, and it's all moving towards a free model. Local broadcast news will be gone soon (relatively speaking), papers will be gone.   Ads and paywalls just keep people from wanting to engage and read. If someone is going to post paywalled stuff on a site like reddit, I don't see a problem with it. Here again - these people aren't taking money from these writers. The people who view paywalled copy/paste are people who already aren't subbed and won't sub.   This sub is controlled by the mods, it's up to them to decide what they want here. I respect their decision, but I don't agree with it.   Also, Jakel, you're way too aggressive in the way you address people on this site. You're wholly unwilling to engage in a conversation. All you want to do is scream at the top of your lungs and attack people who go against your ideas. Look at the post with /u/damn_this_is_hard as an example.

And you don't think it's entitlement? Your philosophical stand point is based on free content, without consent from the owners of the content [the CA in this example]. I fundamentally disagree with that.   these people aren't taking money from these writers.   Not true.

If they don't run into significant issues with your home (which most people don't in any given year), people just feel like things are operating normally and don't really think about the management company - if things go wrong, they run to review sites.    At least that is the theory I am operating under, because if I were to refuse to rent from companies with bad reviews, I literally don't think that would leave me any options."

I was interested in doing an open mike. Nothing came up other than a place called chuckles. They told me there was no open mic because they didn't make money so I took that as Memphis has no comedy scene.
memphis,3bsb2l,Chrisbrown762,8,Wed Jul 1 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"You're actually missing a stand-up show at the Hi Tone tonight (I couldn't go out tonight, but would've loved to have make it there).    Dru's Place is known mostly as a gay/lez bar, with great karaoke, but as their website mentions there's always an Open Mic Comedy Night on Mondays at 9PM.    The Cove (on Broad Street) often has comedy shows, like one this past Sunday evening that funny lady Katrina Coleman and others were onstage at.    r-Memphis subreddit posts like this one will often alert you to other shows around town, like the one I saw at The Brass Door (downtown on Madison) a couple of months ago, with several comics from New York City visiting town...and tickets super cheap at just $5 each.    As soon as Mo Alexander is out of rehab and back on stages - which he expects will be soon - I can't wait to attend his first local gig. That man is just too damn funny.  And having died and come back to life, I expect he'll have some ""reborn"" jokes to entertain us with. Staying tuned for that, but his first post-therapy gig will be in Chicago, so gotta wait for Memphis dates to be scheduled.    You missed the Memphis Comedy Festival in early March, but be sure to look out for it again next year!    After 18 years of constant shows at midnight on the first Friday of every month, this Friday's show is the last one ever for FreakEngine Improve.  Be sure to attend. And even though it's the finish for FreakEngine, I would be surprised if something similar didn't replace it soon.  After all, this Whose Line Is It Anyway?-style show is fairly popular in town, and my expectation is that the players in the troupe will want to reassemble soon enough and continue to tickle funny bones.    Hope this info helps!"

I still have a mental image of the retirees manning the walls, though."

Also there is still large chunk of white population in Midtown.  If anything I thought this was interesting to see how little housing is available downtown

I know for sure I could end up being one of those ""criminals"" that everyone runs from just because my friends like to come over and get baked sometimes.  Actually, looking at your reddit post history you're literally a thief, so it just goes to show how deluded we are about the racial problems in our city. We'll blame white flight on crime while being criminals ourselves..."

My buddy didn't want his so I took it. Not sure if it's actually stealing but I took two instead of one. That's not anywhere close to breaking into someone's car and stealing their things. Or their house, or kidnapping people at gunpoint making the. Drive you around. You made it about race with your white flight comment."
memphis,3brhzf,awyden,0,Thu Jul 2 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"That's not anywhere close to breaking into someone's car and stealing their things.   Yeah, but most crime isn't of that variety. Most crime is larceny, like the kind you boasted on reddit about committing, whether you did it or not.  All I'm saying is that it's a bit rich to excuse white flight as ""white flight from crime"" when you yourself boast about committing crimes on reddit. Just, maybe we need to think about why we are so scared of ""crime"" when we feel secure posting about our crimes online.  I didn't make the comment about white flight, the comment you originally replied to was posted by someone else."

memphis,3brsd6,Jefethevol,5,Wed Jul 1 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"One issue with a tourist destination is people have few places to put the stuff they're traveling with when they stop. And people who aren't from Memphis probably don't realize that they need to try to avoid stopping if they're carrying stuff like this. There's usually a few of these smash and grabs at hotels and stores here every year. Even on law enforcement vehicles. I think the feds got robbed once not long ago and most of those firearms have yet to be recovered.  We know not to leave a damn thing in our vehicles, hidden or in plain sight. We are conditioned to expect criminal activity by virtue of living here. A lot of people passing through here don't have any frame of reference for that."

On you or in a safe are the only options.  I live alone so thats easier done for me.    This is pretty typical of memphis though.

You do everything you can and hope it is enough.  Criminals will find a way. I wouldn't mind adopting a bit of Sharia law with regard to Memphis thieves. Start chopping off hands. Less expensive than buying more sky cop stuff and less explanation needed. You can buy machetes at Bass Pro. Hard as fuck to keep being a thief with a couple stumps."

Any of the other ones in midtown/east memphis that I've been to are smaller and don't have a big clothing selection.  There is also a place in Millington on Highway 51 called ""Dirt Cheap"" which isn't a thrift store exactly but sells damaged and overstocked items. I don't care for the store's no return policy, and they stock a lot of junk, but my wife says they have great deals on clothing and they have a decent selection."

Generally the higher the household income the Goodwill is located in, the better the possible findings. That said, you will spend a lot of time for whatever few finds that there might be. They also seem to have a lot of Walmart returned merchandise that they ask too much for.   Plato's Closet is probably your best bet for clothes as they are more selective on what they put on the rack (since they pay for donations). Clothes Mentor In Cordova is also nice, but they only have women's clothes. I am sure that there are more thrifts out there, that I have not discovered.   The off-price retailers, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Ross Dress for Less are also worth stopping by to complete your wardrobe."
memphis,3bpgbr,icecop,2,Wed Jul 1 02:48:16 2015 UTC,"I am familiar with Plato's closet but typically find their clothes a bit ""young"".  I may still check out the ones here, it may not be the case everywhere"

memphis,3bkot7,chloboe,3,Tue Jun 30 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"Midtown isn't a terrible place and if you don't mind being without a dishwasher and possibly having to use onsite laundry rather than having it in your apartment, you can find something in your budget. It is very easy to end up in a sketchy neighborhood though so if you find some places that you're interested in, I'd be happy to help if you give me the addresses.   Some good sites to check out are trulia, zillow, revid property management, Omni management... You can google Memphis Property Management and a whole bunch of websites will come up that you can check out their properties.   Outside of midtown or living by campus will be out of your budget unfortunately. I just moved last month and it was difficult finding a place in my budget that had the amenities that I need to be happy but I did it!   Let me know if you have any questions at all. :)"
memphis,3bkot7,Kimbrusco,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:47:13 2015 UTC,Is it common to have dishwashers and W/D in the units in Memphis? That's luxury. I haven't had a dishwasher or W/D in 4 years.
memphis,3bkot7,Kimbrusco,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:21 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends. It's always been common for me because evidently I'm a high maintenance bitch. ;) In the older parts of town like by the u of m and midtown it's probably 50/50. A lot of times you'll see hookups for a w/d but no dishwasher, especially if it's a house. A lot of the apartments are older though and will have laundry onsite but the kitchen is too small to accommodate a dishwasher. Since you're used to not having either it won't be nearly as difficult for you to find a place in your budget."

memphis,3bg6qe,DiamondMindMeld,5,Mon Jun 29 05:00:32 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to this building?    It was designed by Edward Terrell and built in 1890 for the Tennessee Club.  The style is a mixture of Victorian, Romanesque, and Moorish.  The Tennessee Club was founded by a group of men , mostly Confederate Officers, who were determined to restore social graces to the city after the Civil War.  They established a library and art gallery and fostered civic and scientific debates.  Many social events were presented in their 4th floor ballroom.  In 1970, the building was purchased by the law firm of Burch, Porter & Johnson, who renovated the building.   source"

The 140 Jefferson building -- inside it, there is an original brick wall structure that may be as old as Calvary Church, and has filled-in archways that may have connected the two, making both  buildings the oldest still in use.  Down the years I heard it may have been the first hospital in Memphis, a saloon and  part of the church.

History is important, especially if it's unpleasant, and for the same reason concentration camps and the Lorraine Motel are preserved, these things too need to be kept around as physical records of what happened and as visual reminders of what shouldn't happen again. Yes, perhaps remove his and his wife's body and send them back to Elmwood, but the statue and those like them should remain.

I get what you're saying, but the difference is how those places are preserved. The concentration camps are now a somber memorial to the millions of Jews who were killed there. The Lorraine Motel is now the Civil Rights Museum. Those places honor the victims, not the perpetrator.  The Forrest statue doesn't honor African Americans or act as a memorial to those who suffered in slavery. It's simply a statue honoring that one guy, who fought for the wrong side of history, who started the KKK, and who arguably committed war crimes at Fort Pillow when his army massacred hundreds of surrendering, unarmed African Americans. It's the equivalent of the concentration camps having a Hitler Memorial Statue or renaming the Lorraine Motel to the James Earl Ray Motel.  The South was on the wrong side of the Civil War. That's an indisputable fact. Civil War museums, preservation of famous battle sites like Shiloh....that sort of stuff is fine. But naming schools after American traitors who fought to keep slaves or flying Confederate flags over government institutions or putting a giant statue of a man who fought for the south and started the KKK right in the middle of the city....not really acceptable.  The Civil War is a part of the south's history, but far too many people still see it as something to be proud of and to be honored. That's not okay.  TL;DR: There's a way to acknowledge and preserve history without also honoring those who contributed to it in a bad way."
memphis,3b8fqw,daprice82,7,Sun Jun 28 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"He didn't start the KKK. He was a patriot who fought for what he believed in, even if it was the losing side. He was cleared of impropriety at Fort Pillow. The guy was not a monster. And in his later years he tried to be a better person and he did do good for the city of Memphis.   The problem with people like you and lots of people in genera, is that they focus on a few things instead of the big picture. Forrest was a man of his time. Slavery was normal back then. Judging past from our views in the present is often a bad thing. You may disagree with what those people did, but you cannot truly fault them for being what was normal at the time.  Hell, my grandmother was a bitter racist, but she grew up not knowing better. I could never fault her for behaving like she did. I'm sure in 50 or 100 years there will be behaviors we think of as normal today that will be viewed as bad."
memphis,3b8fqw,2th,0,Sun Jun 28 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"You're correct on the KKK thing. He didn't found it, he was the first Grand Wizard. That's my mistake.  As for fighting for what he believed in, lots of people believe in terrible things and fight for them. That's not really a good justification.  ISIS believes in what they're fighting for also.  As for being a product of his time, I disagree with that to an extent. You are correct with the grandmother thing. My family is no different. I have older relatives who grew up back in those days and that's just how life was for them, and they're good people at heart even if they still harbor some backwards ways of thinking about things. I get that.  But the thing is, Forrest was on the front lines of a changing time. It was such a divisive issue that it broke apart entire country. He was fighting FOR slavery at a time when people were finally realizing and acknowledging how terrible it was. I'm not sure that's defensible no matter how long ago it was."
memphis,3b8fqw,daprice82,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Forrest was on the front lines because the times required actual fighting. Slavery was his family's business. It had been for some time if memory serves. To him it was like telling a dairy farmer cows now have rights and you cannot milk them without their permission. It is completely understandable he would fight. Now mind you I'm am not saying he was right, just providing some insight into his possible mindset.   Also, as I said, post war he tried to be a better person and did do good for this city. THAT is why he deserves to be honored. I am not saying ignore the slaving, fort pillow, or the klan, but realize those were not the only things he did."
memphis,3b8fqw,2th,2,Sun Jun 28 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I'm admittedly not super familiar with what he did later in life. The only thing I'd question is whether or not whatever good he did later outweighs the bad he did. Al Capone ran soup kitchens during the Great Depression and helped feed his hungry neighborhood, but, yanno. All the murders....  No one is entirely good or evil. But sometimes, people do things so bad that it defines them and overshadows the good that they've done.  Whether that's the case here I suppose is up for debate, but in the eyes of a whole lot of people, Nathan Bedford Forrest is remembered for horrible things. That's his legacy to much of society."

memphis,3b8fqw,BananaPalmer,2,Tue Jun 30 19:17:50 2015 UTC,You do realize slaves back in the day were pretty much viewed as sub human right? They were livestock. Property for a person to buy/sell/trade/slaughter/do whatever they wanted with. A comparison to a cow is pretty damn accurate.
memphis,3b8fqw,2th,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand what you meant. That doesn't change the fact that defending Forrest's right to be honored with a statue because ""the North was trying to take his human livestock"" is abhorrently stupid. There is no defense.

As for his slave trading, he wasn't wrong at the time. Slave trading was a perfectly normal trade. Then it got outlawed.

You literally have to stop every few feet and drag your kayak over it, once you get past that part you come up on standing water with lilly pads and you used every bit of energy you can to get out of it, then you paddle for another two hours through non flowing water until finally the 4th hour you get to moving water and it last all but 5 minutes. It was the worst kayaking I have ever done."

memphis,3b3uhr,biglebowskidude,6,Fri Jun 26 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"Here is that speech.   In July 1875, Forrest demonstrated that his personal sentiments on the issue of race now differed from that of the Klan, when he was invited to give a speech before an organization of black Southerners advocating racial reconciliation, called the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association. At this, his last public appearance, he made what the New York Times described as a ""friendly speech""[10] during which, when offered a bouquet of flowers by a black woman, he accepted them as a token of reconciliation between the races and espoused a radically progressive (for the time) agenda of equality and harmony between black and white Americans.[56] His speech was as follows:  ""Ladies and Gentlemen I accept the flowers as a memento of reconciliation between the white and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as it comes from a colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. ( Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation. I will say to you and to the colored race that men who bore arms and followed the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt - that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going. I have not said anything about politics today. I don't propose to say anything about politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgement in selecting men for office and vote as you think right. Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict. I have been in the heat of battle when colored men, asked me to protect them. I have placed myself between them and the bullets of my men, and told them they should be kept unharmed. Go to work, be industrious, live honestly and act truly, and when you are oppressed I'll come to your relief. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for this opportunity you have afforded me to be with you, and to assure you that I am with you in heart and in hand."" (Prolonged applause.):  To dig him up just ain't right. I personally haven't had anything with a Rebel Flag on it since the 70's. I'm 50 and remember seeing black men sprayed with hoses, beaten and attacked with dogs. As a young kid that really hit me hard.  I didn't want to hurt the feelings of some random old black man that had been through hell. The flags at the state capitals should have been taken down years ago. Renaming the park was stupid and this is even worse.  If they move his body I hope he haunts folks downtown forever. 0_o"

They've also opened a great splash park that will be wonderful in late July. It's not too far from the zoo, but both would be a lot for one day. There's also a great BBQ restaurant down the street from the Children's Museum called Central BBQ.  The Pink Palace is fun for kids, but it's not as tactile and exciting. Mini golf in Memphis isn't better than it is anywhere else, and Mud Island could be boring for a kid too (I always found it boring, but that was a while ago).  Honestly, you might look at the Bass Pro Shops store that just opened in the Pyramid. It's free. They have an alligator and random ponds of fish. It's kind of awesome."

memphis,3b573x,withthegreatone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"The Pink Palace and the Minigolf place on Summer Ave are nothing to write home about.  The Pink Palace is mostly a natural history and Memphis history museum. Not much for a 5 year old unless he/she really likes dinosaurs, because they do have a few skeletons and a small animatronic display. The Minigolf/Arcade/Laser Tag place is pretty overpriced, and there isn't really much there for a little kid.  My 4 year old loves the Children's Museum. It's pricey too, imo, but good for a visit if you haven't been and there's lots of cool stuff for kids to do. They have a splash park outside if you're looking for a water based activity.    If you visit the zoo, don't go on a Tuesday because that's free day for Tennessee residents and it is packed and crazy. Also, I'd recommend parking on Overton Park (access it from the Mclean side) rather than paying for zoo parking. The pandas sleep a lot, but their enclosure is really cool.   If you like ice cream, I'd recommend La Michiocana at Summer and Graham. Local, home made ice cream with lots of interesting flavors.  The Ducks at the Peabody can be fun if you're in the downtown area. Just look at their website for times. I really like the Belz museum of Asian and Judaic art--lots of cool and brightly colored things there that might keep a kids attention. Carved mammoth tusks, statues of animals, etc.  Shelby farms has a huge playground and a disc golf course.  The Dixon Gallery and Gardens is one of my favorites. Small nature trail, art museum, and beautiful gardens all in one place, and the best part is it's free on Saturdays before noon.  Just around the corner from the Dixon is the Memphis Botanical Gardens, and they have lots of stuff for kids to do including a big treehouse, sprinklers, etc.  Feed the fish, see some flowers.

Skilled workers are making that in certain fields.  This will definitely help those that are not on the welfare train, or those that want to legitimately get off of it.  Those that are stuck in the horrible cycle of you don't make enough money  to make it on your own, and need welfare, but can't get a better job to not need welfare because you won't make it out of the hole when you get the job."
memphis,3b2jre,pariah1981,9,Thu Jun 25 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm thinking there will be a lot of skilled, already employed workers in the applicant pool for this place. A couple dollars more an hour and likely a lot less stressful. Their insurance will probably be pretty good as well."
memphis,3b2jre,KnifehandHolsters,2,Thu Jun 25 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure how it will turn out. I can see this as a way to have recent college grads have a job that is semi worthwhile while they look, but if you are making what many make just out of college, would you leave it right away? What I also wonder is,  if it is a stretch for me to spend the money I have heard Ikea products demand, and I don't have a job where I am living paycheck to paycheck, how are the lower tiered people who don't have a lot of expendable income going to afford the furniture there?"
memphis,3b2jre,pariah1981,2,Thu Jun 25 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"IKEA has some pretty inexpensive stuff. Check them out online. They cater to a wide economic demographic with their product lines.   For a few extra dollars an hour and better benefits, I can see a lot of currently employed people making the jump. Keep in mind that we have a large population of people who have little or no college education. This is one way to get themselves a bit of a raise and possibly end up with easier workloads. And they may want that for full time employees, as opposed to recent grads that will turn over faster. People who want to stick around for a while and work. Grads working it as a bridge to another job seem better suited to part time in any position that requires training. Otherwise you're always training new people and not getting a lot done."

There is a limited number of jobs.  The surrounding businesses know what they can and can't afford to pay their employees."
memphis,3b2jre,saki1338,5,Thu Jun 25 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but the other side to this is when the consumers have money to spend on non-necessity purchases, it aids economic growth including more income to businesses - which may in turn need to hire more people or decide to pay their current employees more, in order to retain them so they don't run off to work at some place like IKEA.   Also, higher salary increases productivity, makes for happier employees that are willing to work a bit harder because the job is worth it."
memphis,3b2jre,thadood,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:26:16 2015 UTC,I completely agree with your first point.  I just don't think it will be as profound as this article or the author like to lead people to believe.  Another article I read estimated between 500-750 jobs once fully operational.  I bet a percentage of those were likely going to be making far more than this minimum anyways... and would likely do so at another comparable position.  The benefit of a new employer coming to the area does more to economic growth than simply them having an above average minimum wage.   I'm interested if salary truly does have the influence on productivity...
memphis,3b2jre,saki1338,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:30 2015 UTC,interested if salary truly does have the influence on productivity   I do not think salary will impact the productivity. I do think that it will generate a larger pool of people that apply for positions. This will in turn allow them to select better candidates that will generate better productivity.

Two and a half hours a week giving platelets can make a huge difference in the lives of up to 18 people. It helps people with cancer, burn victims and of course all of the shenanigans that goes on in this town requires lots of platelets. I hit the max donations last year and will be doing it yearly until I'm too old. The benefits are pretty good too. Donating has lowered my cholesterol significantly and I have enough TShirts to last a lifetime. Giving a double platelets gives you 300 points that goes towards things at their gift store that has some pretty nice stuff. It makes great presents and they even have gift cards. I have befriended the staff and actually preformed the ceremony for one of the girls weddings. You will also get coupons for things like free BBQs from Tops and they have a great snack bar and drink selection that you can makes yourself home to. They have a good movie selection and when you give platelets you get to sit in the goods seats with the cool shit. They had Lenny's subs for Donorfest 2015 which was a couple of weeks ago. You get to sit on your ass and they will bring you snacks and you get to save lives while doing so. Platelets can only survive 5 days outside the body and they always need them. Its really a winner winner steak dinner for me. I just got a wicked pop up cooler that holds 28 cans and can be stored flat that was 1000 points. Memphis really needs it."

I read an article about rebuilding a hotel on that lot. The area could REALLY benefit from a hotel. The closest ones I know of to midtown are the ones near Methodist University Hospital or the GenX. Overton square is becoming a hub for tourists and locals alike so I wish there was a nice hotel nearby. On the other hand, this definitely makes sense as a home for Ballet Memphis. I love that it's not just restaurants and shops but it's a performing arts center as well. I think that will give the area longevity and keep bringing people back if the novelty of the new restaurants dies down a little."
memphis,3awtct,tracyyyyyyyyyy,8,Wed Jun 24 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at it from a business standpoint. The city needs new revenue. Taxes paid by businesses play a part in that. The hotel would bring more tax revenue to the city and county than Ballet Memphis. That sort of thing relieves the pressure from homeowners and help provide revenue for salaries and services. Something must have changed for this to be the new option and the hotel being off the table.   Midtown does need a decent hotel option and putting one in walking distance to entertainment, recreation and dining options seems like a great idea. With Overton Park and the zoo right there, it would even make for a less hectic family option than downtown."
memphis,3awtct,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:25:30 2015 UTC,I'm also guessing that ballet Memphis doesn't bring in a lot of dough
memphis,3awtct,je35801,2,Wed Jun 24 14:30:42 2015 UTC,I imagine it doesn't. Hotels have a host of taxes and fees they pay that end up in the local government pocketbooks that a theatre doesn't have.

memphis,3awtct,scd73,2,Wed Jun 24 13:20:13 2015 UTC,I'm sure the developers in the area did their homework and saw a hotel wouldn't actually be feasible. Since the area is a bit removed from interstate travel it would rely predominately on the entertainment district for revenue. The zoo will always be around but a recession could easily shut down non-profits like the theaters that depend on private donations and then the hotel would be a bust.   With Graceland getting a new hotel and downtown getting a few more possibly the tourist attraction areas will be covered. Overton Square seems to really cater more to locals than to attract out of town visitors.

memphis,3avgkb,blood_stache,5,Tue Jun 23 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to go into east memphis, the Farmer (formerly the elegant Farmer, if maps is being dumb) is a really great nice dinner for a date. The owner is super nice and though we probably go less than 5 times a year, he recognizes me and says hi."
memphis,3avgkb,Lereas,-1,Tue Jun 23 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At the risk of sounding like a snob, East Memphis has a better date night selection. Brooklyn Bridge is in Germantown and has good Italian if you're in Cordova."
memphis,3avgkb,blood_stache,2,Wed Jun 24 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"Was just thinking there is also acre, ciao Bella, and lots of others. Or even Earling Jensen and other more pricy places."
memphis,3avgkb,Lereas,-1,Wed Jun 24 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Interim, Casablanca, Half Shell, Hog & Hominy, Andrew Michael... About 20 better options than anything in Cordova."
memphis,3avgkb,arojay,2,Wed Jun 24 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"I imagine he was just listing places he knew in east memphis, and may not have known there was one. In fact 8 didn't realize there was, either....I thought there used to be one but didn't it become ""casbah""? Or is that a different place?"
memphis,3avgkb,Lereas,6,Wed Jun 24 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"No, it's called Casbah now. I think the owner split from the one on Poplar. The menu is a little different, but very similar. For example, Casbah has a proper discounted lunch menu, which Casablanca never had."

memphis,3asfls,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:14:12 2015 UTC,Is that those townhouses nearby? I was gonna say they've got the same problems at Watergrove part deux. I remember when that area was actually really nice...
memphis,3asfls,KnifehandHolsters,3,Tue Jun 23 14:03:05 2015 UTC,"The place used to have a different name. It was Watergrove I think. The only people I knew who lived in it did not have good experiences. Like being on the couch when someone attempts to break in through the patio door. Then burglarized during the day some time later. Both of those were common among residents ten years ago and appear they still are.   A quick crime search of the .25 mile radius around the leasing office address for the last six weeks or so shows a robbery/forcible rape on cypress lakes drive on the 19th, a couple stolen cars, a bunch of vandalism cases(sometimes a broken car window with nothing stolen) and eight home burglaries since the middle of May. All in the apartments.   I wouldn't recommend them. Do you have a specific area you are looking for?"
memphis,3asfls,bugalou,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well, that Germantown area would be nice for us. We also are considering some apartments in Southaven called North Creek.

memphis,3asfls,bugalou,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:18:27 2015 UTC,North creek isn't bad.  I had a few friends live over there.
memphis,3asfls,bugalou,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's location is just so far out. I kind of like that but it is a little inconvenient. I looked at in on the crime map and they had none, can you confirm that?"
memphis,3asfls,krimsonmedic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  The worst you will have to deal with in North Creek are cars driving by with their music too loud, its a pretty benign area.  They have sand volleyball courts too which are fun.  For the most part, if you are living and working in Memphis, you are going to have a commute if you want to live in a low crime area."
memphis,3asfls,KnifehandHolsters,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we kind of figured that since we're both from bigger cities anyway (Seattle and Baton Rouge) but moving to a place where we don't know the area is intimidating. I'll definitely keep North Creek on my list of options, thanks for your help."
memphis,3asfls,Cornballin_POS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"Hope which ever one of you from Seattle likes heat and humidity. :)  Speaking of which, living in the midsouth, you will want to pay attention to the weather more than Seattle.

We've been here about 16 months now with no crime issues. Rent was $825 for a one bedroom. walnut grove is a block down, and trinity, the street the appartment are on...runs back to appling and Whitten. Getting to 40/240 is easy. Walmart is close, movies..gym..restaurants.  The only issue i have is i'm night shift... the landscapers like to cut the grass right next to my bedroom window at 2 in the afternoon. (When i'm asleep).  This isn't my motivation... but if you do decide to move in could you let me know. We get like $300  for a referral.  What I said earlier still stands, and i'm sure you can find reviews online"
memphis,3asfls,arojay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:53:00 2015 UTC,"A few of those are already on my list but if we choose one of those places, I'll definitely let you know so you can get some $$$ :)"
memphis,3asfls,arojay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"You'll be limited to one bedrooms for that money in decent places in the Germantown area. Often we do end up commuting from affordable but safer housing areas to where we work. There have been a few new complexes built in that area, but the safer ones also come with significantly higher rents. Generally in the 1000-1200 a month range.   If you are moving here for work, talk to some of your future coworkers if you can. Some of them have probably rented in these complexes and can give a more up to date account of how safe they are."
memphis,3asfls,ReverendTophat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out Poplar Pines? It's right on the Germantown-Memphis line. Lots of restaurants around, super close to the interstate, as well. I lived there alone for a year, felt safe, and Dan (the property manager) is incredibly nice and helpful. They aren't the fanciest apartments, but it had what I needed. Washer and dryer, dishwasher, decent rent prices."

memphis,3asfls,ReverendTophat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they have a website, you may need to go to apartment finder or something like that. I just happened to spot them one day when I was driving by, that's how I found out about them. They're kind of hidden too, so I'm surprised I even noticed them.  I love that area. It's pretty quiet (other than the train, which is very close to the complex. I liked it though.) It will mainly be families and people in their 30s - not a lot of college kids running around, like Midtown has. Like I said before, lots of options for food, close to Germantown and Collierville, not a horrible drive out to Midtown either.   My rent is super cheap right now, that's the only reason I haven't moved back out to East Memphis."

memphis,3asfls,jojotoughasnails,3,Wed Jun 24 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Hickory Hill meh in ""certain areas""... Maybe 10 years ago that was the case. It's almost universally a pretty bad place to live at this point.  I knew someone that lived in those apartments about a decade ago, and it was a rough area even then. Considering how far downhill Hickory Hill has slid in that time, I can't imagine they're not worse at this point.  The apartments are old, too. The upside is they're a decent size inside, and townhouse style so you don't have anyone living above you. But I don't think that comes even close to outweighing the downsides."

memphis,3arcqi,arojay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:09:03 2015 UTC,Way better than an airport. Airports always have the worst exchange rate because of convenience. I used First Tennessee with Euros and it was decent. Call around and check the rates -- it's what I did to make sure I got the best return.
memphis,3arcqi,blood_stache,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd get it at an airport or the currency place. Last time we exchanged currency at our local bank before our trip, they gave us a crappier rate than the currency kiosks in the airport at our destination."

Who ever your local bank you use call them and ask what their exchange rate is and how much lead time they need.  if it's too long of a time for you or their rate is less than the airport then do it at the airport.

Comedy night is best but Friday is Karaoke night, which is pretty fun. They also sometimes have live music. P&H is always BYOB for liquor. The bartenders are awesome, so please buy mixers and tip them when you close your tab. They also have Blue Moon, PBR, and Angry Orchard on tap usually with a couple of others. Pitchers are pretty cheap. Smoking is allowed inside, and some nights get a lot of smokers. Be prepared for that.  Levitt Shell can be pretty cool for small concerts."

memphis,3aiimf,Irishgrapes,7,Sat Jun 20 14:51:25 2015 UTC,"Memphis has a ton of airport style bungalows throughout midtown. If you want grandiose mansions from the era I suggest Overton Park Drive and McLean for the Galloway Mansion. Also go South down Belvedere from Union. When Belvedere ends take a right on Central and that should show you the main highlights of early 20th Century mansions.   If you want Victorian mansions go down Adams beginning on Third Street until it ends in front of Lebonheur.   If you want less grandiose but still beautiful houses from that era then go through the Chickasaw Gardens, Vollintine-Evergreen, and Overton Park neighborhoods. Basically all you have to do is start on Central Avenue and Cooper Street and just head west. All you have to do is use a N/S street to get you to an E/W street until you hit Union.   My two favorite buildings are the Sears Crosstown building on Cleveland and Kimbrough Towers at Kimbrough and Union.   If you have the time I would recommend to you a book called ""Memphis: An Architectural Guide"" by Eugene Johnson."

Sidonius, I couldn't find anything on ""airport style bungalows"" and I was wondering if you could give me some more info. I also just wanted to throw in that while mansions are nice, I am much more interested in more modest neighborhoods like the three you mentioned, so any more along those lines would be greatly appreciated."
memphis,3aiimf,Sidonius,2,Sun Jun 21 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from the book:  it's a basic bungalow built in the early 20th century with one of two prominent features:   Dormers on each side of the house in the middle of the house to symbolize ""wings""    OR   A house with a low and wide cupola up top to symbolize an airport tower."
memphis,3aiimf,vanblah,2,Sun Jun 21 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"Got it. Is it unique to Memphis? That's really interesting. We have a ""Milwaukee Bungalow"" here, the main feature being a jerkinhead roof, giving it a vaguely Germanic vibe."
memphis,3aiimf,Sidonius,2,Mon Jun 22 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure whether it is unique to Memphis. Memphis is pretty standard as far as architecture goes. May I suggest that you go to the Memphis Made taproom once you are done. It's in Cooper Young and is fairly close to the neighborhoods you will be going to. (Linden, Cowden, and Harbert avenues all pretty much dead end into the taproom). Aldo's pizza is next door which is pretty good. Young Avenue Deli (supposedly has some of the best fries around) or Soul Fish are all in the area too."

Think about it -   When tourists come off the steamboats, they will step on to BB King and Beale St.  Everyone would have to walk down BB King to attend Musicfest in May The Welcome Center would be on BB King   Again, I think that would be a better honor for Mr. King and really cement his name with Memphis."

Any time I call they just try to upsell me to the next service tier rather than address that something is happening (their fault or not) that's slowing me down.

Anyways... /u/Smermio posted the link which is giving the author credit and probably more clicks than they would have received without the post. Stealing, in this case, is more about taking credit for the content. I would like to think of /u/Smermio as a modern day Robin Hood.

memphis,3ab83p,Christophical,3,Fri Jun 19 13:49:11 2015 UTC,"/r/memphis is a community with thousands of subscribers. Posting that content here is tantamount to re-publishing. If that happened anywhere else no one would have a problem with calling it theft. I implore you to come up with an example of this from another industry where this attitude (and mode of change, as you put it) is accepted. Because there isn't one. No one is going to pitch work to that writer because someone saw their story copy and pasted onto reddit. You're being obtuse if you think that's how things work.  And god forbid that writer is already a member of this community, he/she then gets to see the rest of us flippantly dance all over their livelihood, because ""fuck you, paywall. Tell your bosses to change or blah blah blah"". No one else is made to suffer that indignity here.  edit: one more thing; for your Robin Hood comparison to make sense, the Commercial Appeal would need to be ""rich"", but as we all know they are presently hemorrhaging staff and money. There are many reasons why, but the entitled, hypocritical attitudes pervaded in this thread are definitely a contributor."
memphis,3ab83p,slamball,3,Fri Jun 19 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"You are very literal. To make an analogy with Robin Hood... The analogy is for ""information rich"" versus the people that want the content, not actual dollars.  For your example... In the medical community, it was at one time that surgeons could copyright surgical procedures making it illegal for others to copy the procedure with permission. Other surgeons would illegally use the procedure to create better outcomes.  The process of copyrighting procedures was put to a stop for the good of the patients.  Industries change.

There are also a ton of mobile games that have locked room/puzzle themed gameplay. ""The Room"" was a really popular one, but my personal favorite is the ""Doors and Rooms"" series. (Note the lack of creativity in naming convention, oh well.)  If this looks interesting to you, you might try out a few free mobile games to see if you get into the concept. There are lots of not so great knockoffs, but if you stick to the ones I mentioned I don't think you'll be disappointed."

memphis,3a90s6,MojoMercury,2,Thu Jun 18 12:17:44 2015 UTC,Not usually signature requirement unless you request it or they tell you. You can probably let them know in advance where to leave it.
memphis,3a90s6,TwiggiestShoe,2,Thu Jun 18 05:23:01 2015 UTC,I've never had them require a signature before and I buy things in the several hundred dollars range fairly regularly from Amazon so its not just for the cheaper stuff.
memphis,3a90s6,GenLloyd,2,Thu Jun 18 10:35:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Amazon usually REQUESTS that UPS require a signature for items costing over $1K.  Whether UPS botches it or not is another issue.  You can always sign up for UPS My Choice and have packages rerouted anywhere you choose, including the UPS store, so you can pick them up on your own time and dont have to wait around.  FedEx also has FedEx Delivery Manager which is awesome, but Amazon does not use FedEx (independent merchants on Amazon may).  I always use these now, I find them to be safer and more convenient."

I ordered a book on Amazon once, and after like three weeks it never showed up. Just as I was about to request a refund or something, it showed up in my mailbox. The weird part was that it wasn't in a box or envelope, and had no stickers or anything that would have told a mail carrier to bring it to my house. I'm pretty convinced someone stole it, possibly read it, then brought it back to my house."

memphis,3a90s6,jojotoughasnails,2,Thu Jun 18 15:17:54 2015 UTC,It's been a shitshow for us.  It seems they'll need signatures on the most random stuff. There doesn't seem to be a price amount either. I don't know if there's a way to find out if a signature is needed before the package comes. Normally we just see the package will be delivered that way and expect to come home with a box on our doorstep. Instead they leave a note.  I guess it should also be said my boyfriend and I have had some really shitty UPS drivers too. Maybe that's the problem.
memphis,3a90s6,Sloots_and_Hoors,2,Thu Jun 18 15:41:48 2015 UTC,Make friends with your letter carrier and UPS/FedEx drivers and see if they'll leave packages on the side of your house or at the back door.  Ours leave packages outside of the view of prying eyes.  Good folks.
memphis,3a90s6,Bigbadmomma,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah fedex sucks. A lot of times the guy doesn't get out of his truck if he doesn't have to. Especially if he sees a dog nearby. They will not work with you.   Our UPS guy is awesome. Knows our names, our dogs names, and has even came over when delivering a neighbors package to tell me that he thinks there's something for us on the truck so he will probably be back later. He has knocked on the door in the rain and stayed to make sure we are there because since there isn't any where dry outside and didn't want to leave it out in the rain.   We are in the suburbs so that may make a difference."
memphis,3a90s6,hawk121,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just my neighborhood, but our FedEx Ground service is horrible. The UPS and FedEx Express drivers are great. Very conscientious about leaving packages behind a flower pot whenever possible, they don't kick/throw packages. FedEx Ground guy will deliver to my neighbor's house, or some house a block over with the same street number, or just not deliver it entirely. On the rare occasions they actually make it to my house, I've watched him throw the packages onto the porch from 6-8' away."

If you live in a house, in a good neighborhood then we will leave it. Sometimes the guys hide it out of sight, sometimes they don't. Some areas are marked so they can't leave it and need a sig. Apartments have to have a sig. All you can do is try it and see what happens."

Not saying they're not incredible -- I personally love both.  However, the more experienced of Memphis might say Leonard's BBQ, and I can't leave off their insane and unique slaw/bean combination.  They're not on a major street, very tucked away in a place not visible from any thoroughfare, in a neighborhood that isn't trendy at all -- but every day, for decades, their parking lot is packed and they serve up a historic and incredible Memphis flavor."

When I was still on VZW, I had LTE, full bars where I live, and couldn't get more than 2-3Mbps on a good day. It was slower than the old CDMA/3G service. My parents a few miles east of me in Germantown couldn't even make a call without stepping outside and holding their phone just right, and forget about receiving calls or using data. We were with VZW from the time they were formed from the GTE merger, and had great service until we moved here.  Also have been on Sprint here, and it wasn't bad other than my choice of phone. We're on AT&T now, and as much as I hate to give them my money, the service is MUCH better here."
memphis,3a73am,hawk121,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"I've been a CSpire customer for about 5 years and am very happy. Very straight-forward with no contract, and the same flat-rate each month for a plan of unlimited texts and calls (they also offer unlimited data). The customer service is hell and is an extreme headache to get to by phone, to speak with a human I mean. However, I've only had to talk to customer service twice in the 5 years I've had them - so not a problem at all.      I will also say that before CSpire I had Verizon, and they are rated one of the top customer service teams in the US mobile market. They absolutely rocked."

memphis,39y54m,E4R,7,Mon Jun 15 19:15:36 2015 UTC,they are both great.  I use lyft because Uber won't verify my account unless I allow short messages to my phone.  Sprint charges 9 bucks a month for this to be activated so I said screw that.  Never had a bad experience with Lyft and when my friends get ubers they too are great.  Just dont be a dick and youll be fine

memphis,39y54m,jojotoughasnails,3,Mon Jun 15 20:52:51 2015 UTC,I use Uber all the time. Really easy and there's almost always a ton of drivers in the area. I rarely run into surge pricing. Way better experience than using conventional cabs in Memphis

My boyfriend and I had the brilliant idea to use uber to and from music fest back in may...let's just say getting back was almost impossible. But our uber driver was great for fighting the traffic and road blocks to pick us up. I'm sure it's not nearly as difficult to get one on a regular weekend, but there may be a slight price increase due to demand"

memphis,39y54m,PMsomething,2,Mon Jun 15 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"For Lyft, it was like $5.50 base from Crosstown to either Overton Square or beale street. Add $1.50 for their add-on insurance fee, and then whatever tip. Worthwhile."
memphis,39y54m,Alt_ESV,2,Mon Jun 15 23:14:43 2015 UTC,I love uber. Used it from Tom Lee Park for sunset symphony back to cooper young. It was 1.5x surge pricing which was not bad at all.

I don't remember much about the stops/sights on that river though, I wasn't crazy about it. It is a VERY slow river, so it kind of takes a lot of paddling to keep moving.  If you plan another trip, check out the 11 Point river in Missouri - which has a beautiful, blue, freezing cold spring-fed diving hole, and some caves on tributaries you can walk through. The Spring river in Arkansas is fun too, much faster, and has lots of small, easy rapids that add some excitement, and much better sand/rock beaches scattered throughout."

But given this businessman's history of blaming a lack of black advancement on poor values within the black community (see his www.mindnotbehind.com website), I find it hard endorse these kinds of statements.   Ta-Nehisi Coates has written insightfully on ""respectability politics"" as a means of changing the conversation away from structural racism and towards perceived failures within the black community. (See http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/charles-barkley-and-the-plague-of-unintelligent-blacks/382022/ .) It's a centuries-old tactic that absolves governments and white society of any sense of responsibility for the long legacy of policies (slavery, Jim Crow, racist housing and loan policies, race-based stop-and-frisk policies, etc.) that continue to contribute to financial and educational shortcomings in cities like Memphis."

memphis,39pr5h,dischorus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:24:47 2015 UTC,I agree that clothes send a message--but I still think there's a dangerous tendency to blame a symptom (sagging pants as rejection of order and authority) rather than the source of the problem (widespread and systematic exclusion of young black men from roles  of order and authority). I don't believe that the disparities in this country exist because some people won't pull their pants up.

memphis,39hl6b,griderh,6,Thu Jun 11 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"First off the Hi-Tone changed locations a little while ago so make sure you get the address that is on Cleveland and not Poplar.  Most everything lists the Cleveland address but just in case make sure the address says Cleveland.  The Hi-Tone is a really great concert venue, if only for its being a Memphis staple.  It's a small single room with a slightly raised stage.  They have a bar in the back and through a door there is another bar/ lounge area.  There is lit parking behind and in front of the building.  In terms of the area, it isn't what I would call the nicest place to be in town but you could do FARRRRR worse.  There will be a good bit of people (depending on the concert of course) so there likely would be nothing to worry about.  You're a short drive away from some great nightlife spots in town so after/before the concert you could easily go grab some drinks and food.  In short, it's not a bad spot and once the Crosstown building right by it gets up and running then hopefully the area will be even better.  Close to nightlife areas and people around there are typically always looking out for each other.  Hope this helps."
memphis,39hl6b,mcwap,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"This helps a ton. Thanks so much! The only areas of Memphis I've really explored are Beale St, the FedEx Forum, and near the river. What about getting a cab after the show? You think it would be hard to get one?"
memphis,39hl6b,mcwap,2,Fri Jun 12 16:15:07 2015 UTC,Go to Cooper Young or Overton Square after/before the show.  Other good option would be Broad Ave Arts District.  Much more fun than Beale in my opinion (and shared by numerous other Memphians).  Uber and Lyft are never hard to find unless it's a crazy night like MusicFest or a Grizzlies Playoff game or something.
memphis,39hl6b,ltbs,5,Thu Jun 11 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"The area isn't bad. That whole area is on a big upswing. Lots of art galleries around there and things like that.   If you are planning on staying in town, downtown or medical district would probably be the closest hotels."
memphis,39hl6b,ltbs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:20:19 2015 UTC,Great! Thank you! How easy do you think would it be to get a cab from the area after a show?
memphis,39hl6b,mcwap,3,Thu Jun 11 20:07:47 2015 UTC,Probably wouldn't be too terrible. Though you could also grab a Lyft or Uber just as easy.
memphis,39hl6b,TheMattGIlliamTSK,3,Thu Jun 11 20:14:30 2015 UTC,Seconded... Uber/Lyft is the way to go.  Several friends work for them and many friends use the service... haven't heard a single complaint from either side yet.
memphis,39hl6b,TheMattGIlliamTSK,3,Thu Jun 11 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"The area isn't that bad, in my opinion. I've played there a few times and never had any trouble. They also have security around the building, so it shouldn't be a problem. Who are you going to go see?"

He was last seen sometime between 2000 on Monday and 0600 on Tuesday in the Fairwoods area in Collierville (Collierville-Arlington). He is approximately 2 years old, neutered, and may be wearing a camouflage collar and a red tag indicating that he is microchipped.  The microchip should be updated, but if not, it will have his vet's information. We will also check with House of Mews, Fayette County Animal Rescue, and the Collierville Animal Shelter on a regular basis.   He may or may not (depending on his mood) respond to the name ""Critter"". He enjoys deli meat, specifically turkey.   This cat is very important to our family. He's a sweet guy and we would just love to see him home again.   Please PM me with any leads or advice. I'll be posting to PetFBI shortly."

memphis,39c7sg,naudsie,2,Thu Jun 11 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'd go somewhere where there are more open areas...I don't know if I'm saying what I mean. Like for instance people might be put off if you walk up to their table and start chatting with a group.. but if you're sitting at the bar it's self, you can chat up the people next to you.   Or pool tables, start playing, and start up a conversation with the groups around you.  If you like sports that would be a quick way, find a team with open tryouts (there are kick ball leagues, dodgeball leagues, softball, roller derby. Hell you could go to a kick boxing class or take up cross fit or something)  Meetup is a good website to look for board game groups and stuff.   Shelby farms has a disc golf course, you might run into people there and ask if they want to play.  I play a lot of video games, weight lift, and shoot at my dads farm. I have a PS4 though, and have fallen away from PC gaming. We occasionally go play paintball. I'll probably be attending the Anime Blues con if you like any of that. Don't really go drinking much, majority of my drinking during the summer is at my friends house (he has a pool and a grill).  I used to do quite a bit of Stuff at Tier 1 Group, it was technically work since I was being paid... but it was a blast. I'd say try to get on there PRN , it's basically a paid day of fun. BUT...they stopped using contract people several months ago. Don't know if they will start back up."

memphis,39792h,adamhimself,13,Tue Jun 9 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"A left turn lane would be great, but bike lanes sound like a pretty poor fit for Union. The amount of high speed traffic, the frequent right turns, and the general lack of width of the road seem like they'd make bike lanes impractical. With Madison running parallel with slower, lower-volume traffic, and already bike-friendly, what's the point?"
memphis,39792h,primenumbersturnmeon,3,Tue Jun 9 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"But now there are 6 lanes (3 on each side)... so if you make a turn lane in the middle, then you are left with 5.  So, the solution is either to have 3 lanes eastbound and 2 lanes westbound (or something similar), or split the 5th lane and make bike lanes on either side."
memphis,39792h,rappinkapc,4,Tue Jun 9 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"Or widen the remaining 4 lanes to ease that right lane on Poplar feeling.   I absolutely detest losing lanes of traffic to bikes. I understand that Memphis needs to become more bicycle friendly, but why worsen are already congested roads to put in bike lanes that in many cases are rarely used? I'm looking at you, Southern Ave"
memphis,39792h,SurpriseButtStuff,8,Tue Jun 9 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"You probably detest losing lanes of traffic to bikes because you mistakenly believe, as do most commuters, that adding more efficient roadways for cars reduces traffic.  Studies have consistently shown that it doesn't, it just encourages longer commutes as people become more willing to move to the suburbs, and traffic normalizes to the same overcrowded state.  Though to be fair, just adding bike lanes without taking more comprehensive steps to shift people away from driving doesn't tend to help anything either."
memphis,39792h,reasondefies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"There has been talk of adding bike lanes to Summer and the rest of Parkway. It was part of a master transportation plan. That should be real fun. Like you mentioned, I've wondered why the city sticks to the idea that people will just magically ride bikes to work because a lane was restriped. That's not how any of this works. Retiming the lights along roads with bike lanes may help, but it won't if you're stuck behind a slow ass.   I do think Union will fare better with bike lanes, but mostly because it will bring a turn lane. That will ease congestion immensely. And, if they can do something with a shared area for the vehicles that are usually camped out near the hospital in the right lane, they'd help even more."

memphis,39b2zk,Sloots_and_Hoors,20,Wed Jun 10 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"I merge as soon as I see the sign. The reason why is that though cars are not moving the same full speed as if both lanes are open, it's sitll faster than the stop and go at the chokepoint of where the lane is blocked (zipper-merging). But no, you just can't resist that sweet open lane all the way to the chokepoint and so you cruise up there by-passing everyone who got in line in an orderly fashion. What makes you so special that you deserve to go to the front? So the lane-blockers are the real heroes here. This merging at the point of the choke is actually slower overall than merging in tandem early. So not only are you stupid, you're also an asshole—highly correlated traits, I've found."
memphis,39b2zk,JimJamieJames,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:57:39 2015 UTC,Actually there is quite a few evidence saying you should merge at the last moment because it is faster.  I am only posting one article but I remember from one of my Operations Research(logistics) classes the professor informing us how it was better to be rude than polite in this situation.  I still merge early though because I just can't be that asshole.  http://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/07/the-beauty-of-zipper-merging-or-why-you-should-drive-ruder/
memphis,39b2zk,workaccount38103,0,Wed Jun 10 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the density of traffic, and I just read and it says as much in that article. If the density is such that everyone has no problem merging into one lane as soon as they are aware of the situation, they should. It's my observation that if people zoom up to the end when everyone else is being courteous that they then create the logjam at that spot when it doesn't have to exist. Again, this depends on the density of traffic. If the density is such that merging cannot happen at cruising speeds, then no one is zooming anywhere anyway because it's already at near-max capacity, hence the ensuing logjam."
memphis,39b2zk,JimJamieJames,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article?  It says lane merging aka the zipper method is safer and faster.  The reason you get a log jam is because  ""enough drivers don't fill both lanes or intentionally block the soon-to-end lane in the form of vigilante car justice""    EDIT:  Seriously just google when to merge.  Zipper method is the best method."
memphis,39b2zk,workaccount38103,2,Thu Jun 11 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"Ah my mistake. It looks like what I'm advocating for IS zipper merging. I'm talking about the glut that ends up happening at the chokepoint being bad. Yes, zipper merging is what I do and I do it far before the chokepoint. What messes it up is someone zooming past. If you read the article, the cars have to be going similar speeds, so you can't just do that. You have to try to match their speed as close as possible in order to merge. So in that respect I agree. In fact, I think OP doesn't realize what zipper-merging is because I was going by his definition.   If roads are clear enough that everyone is already driving close to the speed limit, zipper merging isn't as effective   ..is an understatement, but then it would bely the article if the author acknowledged this."
memphis,39b2zk,JimJamieJames,0,Thu Jun 11 14:21:02 2015 UTC,Well yeah zipper merging isn't effective in that situation.  There is no need to merge if roads are clear.  It is only effective in situations where one lane ends due to construction or an accident.  Zipper merging is when you merge at the choke point.  Merging before then clogs up traffic.  For it to be effective people need to stay in the lane they are in and for both lanes to be equal in size.  People who try to prevent people from merging at the choke point are the ones screwing everything up which is what the OP is trying to say
memphis,39b2zk,workaccount38103,3,Thu Jun 11 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"I can see that, but doesn't the person holding everything up just become the new chokepoint themselves? Seems like you just zipper merge no matter what at that point and the guy slowly rolling along doesn't make a difference. It just makes the chokepoint further up the road.. A big issue I have with it is no one can do it right. Everyone either guns it preventing a proper merge until someone 'nice' comes along or they rubberneck, or both."
memphis,39b2zk,JimJamieJames,2,Thu Jun 11 15:45:44 2015 UTC,Rubber necking is the worst.  I mean there is an accident and construction every day.  Why do people need to stop and look????

memphis,39b2zk,JJX119,5,Thu Jun 11 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"At this point there should just be billboards with basic traffic etiquette on them since the interstate construction is causing bad traffic elsewhere. Since I don't feel like I should make a whole post devoted to this, let me just say that people who are turning left onto north bound East Pkwy from Madison are screwing it up for everyone behind them by not using the acceleration lane on the left and instead stupidly waiting for all three lanes to clear before they take a much wider left turn than necessary. If you're turning from the left lane, you should end up in the left lane. That intersection should be smooth and easy but it's become another unnecessary clusterfuck of ignorance."
memphis,39b2zk,BWright79,6,Wed Jun 10 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"""Zipper merging"" is NOT avoiding the queue to drive your happy ass to the fucking off ramp and STOPPING on the damn interstate to wait for someone to let you over. I see people with SHELBY tags do this all the time on my way into work on the 240 N/40 E ramp.   I was going south on Perkins yesterday after work and this bitch cruises up the TURN ONLY lane and on into the intersection at Quince and swerves into traffic to avoid the queue. When the road split I looked over to give her a go to hell look and she had two little kids in the back seat!  I keep telling myself I'm going to come in late or leave work early one day and stand at one of these places with a sign calling these assholes out."

If we would all agree that zipper merging is the way to go, it would be fantastic. But as it is, the majority of drivers seem to be early mergers.   It can be very frustrating to follow an already established and generally accepted system of early merging, only to see you fly by, with your implied finger out of the window making me even later for work.   So, until we hold a zipper v early referendum, just get back in line like the rest of us."

She smiled, and gave a thumbs up back. Heck yea!  The idea behind blocking the lane, is the same that we learned in middle school lunch lines. Fairness. Everyone should wait their turn.  In this instance we (hey look at me maybe #TrafficJustWarrior can become a thing) are trying to raise that awareness to future possible mergers that speeding all the way up bypassing multiple other is unacceptable. We are all just trying to get to the same place.  Merging at a ""polite time"" is fine, but don't abuse it. Want to avoid the back up? Wake up earlier."

So long as enough drivers don't fill both lanes or intentionally block the soon-to-end lane in the form of vigilante car justice, the concept still has to contend with confusion, whether from out-of-town travelers or oblivious commuters.

memphis,393b6b,Jakelshark,2,Mon Jun 8 23:17:49 2015 UTC,Looks neat and I plan to visit. Has anyone else been yet?
memphis,393b6b,kimberrleigh,3,Mon Jun 8 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"I went to this when it was in DC 3ish years ago, as it's a touring exhibit. It was really cool and worth the visit if you are a gamer (as I'm assuming 99.999999999% of y'all are).   My sister, who is not a gamer (but respects the industry nonetheless), enjoyed it as well, but I could tell it wasn't up her alley. We were definitely the only two females there at the time without (small) children or with their boyfriend, so that was an interesting dynamic.   As far as the exhibit itself, I can't remember too much, but I do remember it was set up in a timeline format and most people (ie. the kids) hung around the more modern displays for a long time and in huge groups so it was hard to get in to read the info on the display.   Overall, go see it. It's cool that they did decide to make Memphis a stop on the tour, definitely thought we'd be overlooked for a myriad of reasons. :)"
memphis,393b6b,Lereas,2,Tue Jun 9 00:03:20 2015 UTC,I thought that I remembered having seen it before. Maybe it was in DC since I was there 4ish years ago.   Though I may have seen it in Boston?

I can tell you that the new exhibit at the Pink Palace, called ""Wicked Plants"", just opened up, and the Big Screen 3D movies currently showing are ""Humpback Whales"" and ""Hidden Universe"". The Planetarium is currently undergoing renovation but they're still showing astronomically-themed shows elsewhere in the museum."
memphis,392rgj,mrchrishill,6,Mon Jun 8 21:24:51 2015 UTC,With such a short time... Hit up Civil Rights Museum and grab Central BBQ or Gus's Chicken in your way out. Prepared to be moved by both.
memphis,392rgj,tracyyyyyyyyyy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is always my suggestion. With such a small amount of time: Civil Rights Museum and then Central BBQ, fried chicken at Gus's, diner food at Arcade, or a soul burger Earnestine and Hazel's. Walk around South Main (that's where the Civil Rights Museum is) and just explore the area a bit. To me, it's one of the most uniquely ""Memphis"" parts of Memphis. You can check out shops like Hoot+Louise. The Lorraine Motel is a must-see. The Metal Museum isn't far if you have time, and it's beautiful."

memphis,392rgj,4GrandmasAndABean,5,Tue Jun 9 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"what is the best bbq place in town?   Central.  As for things to do, there's the Pink Palace, which was once a mansion owned by the Piggly Wiggly guy, now turned into a museum.  There's the Bass Pro Pyramid. Haven't been myself but it's a big stupid pyramid on the river. Makes for a good bar story ""Yeah, they had a giant reflective pyramid sitting right there on the river."" ""What was inside?"" ""Bass Pro Shop""  There's always hitting up Beale St if you want to drink and hang with people who are in a similar situation to you."
memphis,392rgj,notfuzzi,3,Mon Jun 8 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, two suggestions for the pink palace, Ill check it out! I may drive by the pyramid, would be cool to get a pic I guess. Also, I probably wont be drinking anywhere. I've got to head out that night for St' Louis."

memphis,392rgj,grizzstraight,2,Mon Jun 8 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"Went and ate at germantown comissary seeing as I arrived earlier than expected. 1 hour wait, but hands down the best bbq I've had yet. I'm eager now to see how KCMO best bbq compares."
memphis,392rgj,tacojohn48,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yes! It really is amazing, but since it's in Germantown few ever go.   And as a Memphian born and raised, I'm required to tell you that Kansas City BBQ is not as good. Not that I've ever eaten it. But I can't say otherwise. :)"
memphis,392rgj,grizzstraight,2,Wed Jun 10 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"BBQ - hit up Tops BBQ. Central is still touristy... Tops is the shit. Places to visit, definitely the Zoo, Pink Palace, and Civil Rights Museum. Also, just take a walk down town. Go to the Cotton Museum, haven't been but I know it's historic to Memphis, Sun Studio, Stax. Then travel over to the Cooper-Young area and see what all the artistic type are up to. Grab some coffee at Otherlands and say hi to my brother! Go to some breweries. Drink some Wiseacre. Pick up guitar, become a musician. Eat some cheese fries at Huey's. Become a Grizzlies fan. Get a growl towel. Walking in Memphis will be your favorite song that you tell all your friends that you hate but secretly love. Be Memphis. Become Memphis. Let Memphis absorb you."

memphis,3907hi,kilgore_trout87,3,Mon Jun 8 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I live downtown at Fielder Square by the baseball stadium and have enjoyed it. The best part being able to walk to most everything I do (except the grocery store).  All you have to say to the panhandlers ""Sorry I don't have cash"" and they will leave you alone."
memphis,3907hi,workaccount38103,3,Mon Jun 8 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"I also live at Fielder, my experience thus far has been pretty good. Fielder is pretty central to most things, I walk pretty much everywhere, but they have a parking garage so driving is an easy option too. At night, I usually just walk down Union to main street as it seems a bit safer to walk by the peabody and co. than the other streets.   edit: not really a response to workaccount38103, but just tagging on this thread"
memphis,3907hi,b00xx,2,Mon Jun 8 15:28:46 2015 UTC,"I walk or run from N. Main to South Main and back at least four to five times a week. I get hit up once or twice within that time by panhandlers but no one's aggressive about it. Wear headphones if it really makes you uncomfortable but to be honest it's a good life skill to unlearn being awkward with/when saying no. The side of Main by E&H is more expensive since it's pretty much all single or double units occupying one floor, but they are really amazing layouts. If you don't want to stretch your budget then I'd suggest rooting down somewhere in the middle. I lived in midtown for almost five years and I visit it often on nights out, however I've really grown to enjoy downtown Memphis both event wise and its vibe during the day."
memphis,3907hi,bobbyshaker,2,Mon Jun 8 14:28:35 2015 UTC,I've lived downtown (South Main) for two years now and can count on one hand the number of times panhandlers have said anything to me. The Downtown Flats/Barboro/Van Vleet area is great - my friends who live there all love it.
memphis,3907hi,ACroquet,3,Mon Jun 8 12:07:40 2015 UTC,Have you ever been hit up by the older lady that pulls around an oxygen tank (or something)?  She has two young girls with her and always asks for bus fare. I jog downtown when I get off work and every time I run on South Main she is there and asks me even though it's fairly obvious I don't have any cash.

In terms of pan handling I am not sure if it has gotten worse or better, but I always say that I am a college student in debt and have no cash to spare (which is true). Don't be afraid to say no."
memphis,3907hi,ryokimball,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"I live at Blair Tower, which is just a little further out (beside Le Bonheur). I rent a one bedroom for under $700 + about $100 utility (if you sign up and mention me I get a bump). There's a gas station and liquor store right by there which often has some panhandlers but they stay at these locations; there's also a Yum's and Checkers which they don't bother you at. The people are nice, the maintenance is good & responsive. Parking can be difficult. Gym & swimming pool. You can walk to Beale & Main if you're not terribly out of shape."

Downtown is where The Med is. It's also where the apartments are for ""crazy"" people (aka people who just live off the government). These buildings are always going to be there. Trashy people are always going to be hovering around looking for pills and bothering people.   Hell, I worked right around the midtown/downtown meetup area and we'd still get the occasional addicting asking for money for the ""trolley"" even though we all know they don't run. Not to mention the sob stories of people's lives to get $5 for ""gas"". Yea. Ok.   You just have to get used to it. Ignore them or tell them you have no cash. It sucks but it's just something you have to deal with living in that area of Memphis."

memphis,3907hi,jojotoughasnails,-3,Mon Jun 8 18:05:29 2015 UTC,Technically no..but it's close enough to effect downtown
memphis,3907hi,nvisible,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:48:08 2015 UTC,What does the Med (new name Regional One Hospital FYI) have to do with panhandlers? Which ones are the apartments for crazy people? I haven't noticed that sign up anywhere?   Are you just talking out of your ass here?
memphis,3907hi,jojotoughasnails,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:06:00 2015 UTC,The Med is an awesome hospital. Unfortunately it's also where people who have no health insurance go. The drunk homeless guy that fell over and busted his head? He'll be at The Med. Loser criminals who got in a fight and stabbed each other? They'll also be there.  Memphis Towers are primarily section 8 housing. They seem to specialize in the mentally ill. Anytime you're around the midtown/downtown area and see a crazy person...it's probably someone that lives there.
memphis,3907hi,nvisible,2,Tue Jun 9 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"You realize that Regional One is the Level One Trauma center for the mid-south. They serve five states. The idea that only the uninsured go there is no longer valid. They also have the high risk OB unit for the region, the sickle cell clinic for the region, and the burn center for the region.   I am a bit sensitive when people speak poorly of the Med when they have no experience there. I worked in the trauma center for 10 years and saw miracles every time I walked through the doors.   Please update your bigotry before speaking."
memphis,3907hi,jojotoughasnails,0,Wed Jun 10 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"......did you just skip right over my first sentence?  I said it was an awesome hospital. Sorry I didn't list it's mile long list of credentials and awards to please you.  That doesn't mean they don't have to deal with shitty people. It's an unfortunate reality. And it's a fact that the uninsured go there. If the police pick up some overdosed loser they have to take them to The Med.  So yes, if shit were ever to go wrong in my life I sure as hell am glad I live close to The Med (even though we have other awesome hospitals in Memphis too). However, it's also very probable that there's going to be some druggie homeless person wandering out as I'm rushed in."
memphis,38znzb,the18thtee,6,Mon Jun 8 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Try http://www.churchhealthcenter.org/patientrequirements its run by a good group but im not sure if you DQ due to having insurance  ""You must be uninsured and need immediate care."" They charge based on your income starting at $25  edit  I should also mention of course that healthcare is one thing to ignore in terms of cost. Perhaps you may need to look at other life choices such as changing employers or careers. BCBS announced a 20% raise in premiums recently. My previous employer paid 70 percent of healthcare and covered dental/vision/life for free. That was a shitty $10/hr job. Any normal doctors visit you should not have to worry about deductables or out of pocket but only copays of 10-20/20-40(specialist)   A career or job change may be the best move for your health, even if they dont pay all of it, you can still take advantage of having those premiums payments before tax."
memphis,38znzb,cheap_cologne,3,Mon Jun 8 11:49:32 2015 UTC,"Nurse here. Ask yourself why do you think you need an xray? If you have an injury you need to go to an emergency room or to an urgent care clinic or minor medical clinic. Xrays won't usually be routine without an injury. If you're injured, get help asap before it becomes worse. If you want an xray just to check something out, a doctor or nurse practitioner will want to assess you and it is likely they still won't xray you without evidence of some injury or other.  Doctor offices want to get paid too, so if you explain your situation many will work with you on a payment plan. There's also clinics affiliated with university of Tennessee medical center you can go to. A medical student or newly graduated resident physician  might examine you, but you'll also see an experienced doctor too. That should be sufficient for routine and stable matters like refills on adhd meds. Alot of the clinics in Walgreens will do routine physicals too.   With all that being said, many doctors offices have different prices for everything. Call them and ask. There won't be an industry standard price point in private practice. Your best bet is likely through the UT med school or through something like Methodist Teaching Practice."
memphis,38znzb,j0351,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:21:06 2015 UTC,"Good luck. Usually medical costs are so convoluted that the only way to get the cost is to actually get the service then check the bill when it arrives. I know because I've asked for a list of cost at several clinics and they always look at me like I just stepped out of a UFO.   FWIW, I've always been able to negotiate a $40/mo payment plan for virtually every doctor and hospital bill I've ever had."
memphis,38znzb,mechtonia,2,Mon Jun 8 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"How the hell did you manage $40 hospital bills? I had emergency gallbladder removal with 3 day stay, the next week my husband was hospitalized for double pneumonia and spent one day in the ICU and 3 more in the hospital.  We had massive bills (17 separate bills related to our two hospital stays) they would not break our payments down to more than 12 months. So our smallest bill was $80 with most around $150 a month. Took us forever to pay off the $7400 and we really struggled because each department bills separately and had to pay 8 or 9 bills every month that were over $100 and if we missed a payment we would be sent to collections. Thank goodness we had a family member that could afford to front us the money and let us pay them at a more reasonable rate. Screw our healthcare system! We paid $400 per month for insurance and still went broke from being hospitalized."
memphis,38znzb,do11411,2,Mon Jun 8 14:32:37 2015 UTC,"I just call them up and tell them what I can/will pay. I've been paying one hospital $40 per month since my son was born. He starts college in the fall.  For clinics and the like, sometimes I don't call, I just send a payment in each month. I think that by law, a medical debt can't be sent to collections if it is being paid on. I might be wrong about this.  Right now I am paying at least 6 different providers $40-50 per month. And this is on top of the $641/month that I pay for insurance.   We are all fools for continuing to vote these morons into office that have created and sustained the least efficient health care system in the developed world."
memphis,38znzb,mechtonia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"I begged and pleaded for lower payments, they didn't care and told me that's just how it is what you go to the hospital (like I planned for my gallbladder to totally quit working, and my husband enjoyed pneumonia so much he let his oxygen level fall to 70% for fun) and they absolutely will send you to collections. I had alway been told they couldn't as long as you send something, and the promptly called and told me that was horseshit and I had to set up a ""reasonable"" payment plan of at least $100 per month."

memphis,38wqei,iamzane64,6,Sun Jun 7 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Heroin is a helluva drug that ruins so many lives. Rule of financial thumb: you want to make in one week enough to cover for your monthly rent. Trust me on this.  Personally, I would leave the $33/shift job and try and get an hourly job somewhere, and do that fast.  Go to Target, or Starbucks, or Best Buy and apply. They all should pay decent and should be relatively easy to get on at. You want to clear at least $300 a week or you just can't make ends meet in Memphis. Your best bet would be to find a ""Room for rent"" on Craigslist. Find someone renting just a room out of their house. That way you shouldn't have to put a deposit down and can probably move in somewhere quickly without a huge commitment. Hope this helps. Good luck buddy."
memphis,38wqei,Music_animal,6,Sun Jun 7 16:08:15 2015 UTC,You want to sublease a place for 3 months? I'm about to go to Kentucky for training for my new job. I don't need to pay for my apartment while I'm not here.
memphis,38wqei,Rawtothedawg,5,Sun Jun 7 17:58:33 2015 UTC,There is a house on New York in cooper young that rents by the week. Getting a week by week is your best bet. I've had to do it a few times. Deposits are usually $100-$200 plus the first two weeks. You'll definitely need a better paying job. As a server that should be easy. Craigslist really is your best bet to finding housing. week by week also gives you the financial freedom to save up money.   Sorry to hear about your situation. Heroin destroys everything.

memphis,38wqei,AtlJayhawk,6,Sun Jun 7 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"First, if you're going to wait tables six days a week, find a better paying restaurant. Strictly speaking business, you want to work where people tip best. High price per head, as well as a clientele that actually tips 20%+. You need to be able to spend $600/mo on a room and utilities. It's best to have two months rent saved at all times, I'd guess three months saved up to move out. Where do you work and how old are you? You can PM me."

Huey's (multiple locations) is usually serving food until at least 1am except on Sundays. The problem with other late night places (read: food after midnight) is that they arent consistent with their hours and will close early if it is slow.

Other than that I also dated a chic with a huge piece from Babak T. before he started Ronin and it's still the coolest tat I've ever seen.

memphis,38omhp,masterofmustaches,9,Fri Jun 5 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, cost. Someone has to pay for it... So it comes down to how much people want government to provide and how high taxes would be to support that. Different people/parties have different opinions on those answers."
memphis,38omhp,Sleepytitan,10,Fri Jun 5 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Maybe.  Then there's this:   The federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs through 2017, then make the state will be responsible for 5 percent through 2020, and 10 percent after that.   And this.   Gov. Bill Haslam’s proposal was met with brutal opposition from the start in a legislature that built its Republican supermajorities in both chambers with opposition to President Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act"
memphis,38omhp,murryj,3,Fri Jun 5 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the constituents of some of those who voted against it. Imagine you are in a district where every election is Republican vs Republican. If you vote for this, your opponent will say that you have supported Obamacare and that he's more Republican than you. Then you can try to state your case logically and soundly, but it will probably go over like the scene in Idiocracy where Joe tries to state his case for the court. As a result you'll likely lose your next election over that one yes vote."

memphis,38omhp,meandmybadness,5,Fri Jun 5 20:57:51 2015 UTC,He's got some strange political views.  And by strange i mean all over the place.  One minute he'll state that people need to get off the government teet and the next he's blasting people for voting something down.  Don't get me wrong i listen to them every morning.  But he really doesn't like republicans and if they do or say anything that is against Obama's stated policies well then it must be because they hate blacks.  And the only reason the people in Nashville voted it down is because Obama is black.  That's total hyperbole.  They voted it down because its yet another controlling injection from the federal government.  These people ran on anti federal government platforms. so its not surprising that they would reject federal government aid.  Also as an aside.  He doesn't even live in TN.  He's another person who ran to MS and then bitches and complains about what Memphis and TN does.  If he doesn't like it he should move here and vote for people he agrees with.

In essence they said ""No thanks federal government, we don't want several billion dollars because we don't want to be caught doing anything that Obama had anything to do with"".  Having a super-majority of one party controlling both houses and the governorship is very dangerous. Google what has happened in Kansas.

memphis,38kjhf,FourthJames,8,Fri Jun 5 08:34:36 2015 UTC,This may not have been the thing to do but I really hope they find some way to clean up Beale st.  Its just not comfortable to go down there when the entire street is butt to butt with people who aren't spending any money and just loitering around.  I really wish the had kept the ten dollar cover charge in place.

memphis,38kjhf,KnifehandHolsters,0,Thu Jun 4 23:32:10 2015 UTC,"No. Apparently charging money is ""racist"""
memphis,38kjhf,jojotoughasnails,5,Fri Jun 5 00:11:43 2015 UTC,"Charging people a fee to get onto a public street isn't any better than kicking people out of a public street. Neither of those tactics are racist, regardless of who complains; there was no shortage of any minority group on Beale when the cover charge was in place. That doesn't make either of those approaches proper, though. In both cases I believe the public's right to assemble was infringed upon.  Nothing about the Court's decision says that MPD can't have a strong presence on Beale. They tend to, and I expect that to continue as long as the city can afford to put a detail there. I do find it interesting that many of the Beale Street disturbances that have escalated to violence over the past couple of years have involved off-duty law enforcement, but that's just a personal observation."

And with MPD officers in shorter and shorter supply with more leaving the city because their benefits have been trashed, it'd be nice if they didn't have to have cars there every night of the week. Those officers are desperately needed to answer calls in the city. Especially considering it's summer which is when crime rates are highest."

I'm glad these are gone because it really seemed like it was a last ditch effort to get some arrests in before the end of the night."
memphis,38kjhf,albatrawesome,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"I actually opened a IA case against some officers that did not want me taking pictures inside Beale (their reason to nearly tackle me and look through my camera after telling them not to, was that I may be taking pictures of underage girls), essentially looted through all my shit and told me I could leave and never come back (if I was seen again I would immediately be arrested) or go to jail. Basically I was told that during the say it is a public street but at night it is officially lease or something to the Beale association making it private. I at least spoke with two higher ranking officers later and was told the way I was treated was wrong and I felt it was genuinely resolved.  Good to see this in the news"

memphis,38geu5,Awwfull,3,Thu Jun 4 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, WMC and WHBQ decided to go back to their VHF frequencies after the digital cutover, and digital TV over VHF can be really bad with an indoor antenna, especially the farther away from the transmitter you get. I'm only a few miles from WMC's tower, and I have lots of trouble getting it from my indoor antenna.   If you can't put it in an attic or something, I'd suggest seeing if you can get your antenna positioned at an exterior wall facing the transmitter, preferably a window. The fewer walls/trees/buildings between the antenna and the transmitter, the better. You can use antennaweb.org to get the correct bearing from your address. Most of the transmitters are loosely positioned along 40 near Bartlett, so from downtown you can pick up most of them along one bearing."

memphis,38geu5,kipgordon,3,Thu Jun 4 02:01:54 2015 UTC,When I worked at WHBQ I used a paper clip stuck in the coax plug and it worked great...
memphis,38geu5,hiroshi_x,2,Thu Jun 4 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain, and I've helped others with this. WMC-TV is one of the few low VHF stations, and it's difficult to pick up consistently. Intentionally or not, their technical problems are pushing people to get cable and just watch it on there. But, if you're savvy enough, you can spend your money on a good antenna instead.   Solutions from best to worst / difficult to easy:    Of course a big antenna on your roof will work the best. As an added bonus, you might pick up stations outside of Memphis.  A big antenna in your attic. A medium size mounted outside high up on a wall (google for the ""homemade hdtv antenna"" style, or buy one pre-made at a local hardware store that'll let you return it if necessary) Big bunny ears style antenna as high as you can stand them.    Ultimately, the antenna truly needs to be up high and with the least obstructions between you and WMC. If you have a window facing the right direction, bunny ears by the window just might work out, too. If you're crazy enough, you could also have multiple tuners (converter boxes) with different types of antennas on each (UHF only, VHF only)."

It is a bunch of booths selling comics and related merchandise (toys, shirts, etc), artists doing commissions and autographs, and a few events (a costume contest or something).

memphis,38d5zz,baron41,2,Wed Jun 3 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents. It is still in its infancy, so they're still working out what it needs to be. Having said that, there will be over 80 vendors, 2 food trucks, and a cosplay contest.   Hint #1: if you plan to attend the Memphis comic and fantasy expo in November, they sold buy one get one tickets last year. Bring money for that. ($40 for 3 day???)  Since this con is still new, go and experience it for yourself. It will help organizers to make it even better next year. Bring some money, support your local artists, and make the con better.     Get your friends, throw on an old Halloween costume, and head over to the agricenter. There is nothing like taking a picture with someone who likes your cosplay. I went as Baymax for the MCFC last year and I couldn't take 5 steps without a picture being taken.   Enjoy!"

memphis,38d36e,iambassist,8,Wed Jun 3 13:13:26 2015 UTC,I think that might be because the middle lanes used to change direction in the morning/evening based on rush hour. But I'm not 100%.
memphis,38d36e,jojotoughasnails,10,Wed Jun 3 13:55:35 2015 UTC,And as a result there is no turn lane or left-turn arrow lights.

memphis,38d36e,deathlord9000,5,Wed Jun 3 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Poplar was 4 lanes at one point. When they expanded,  there was only so much room without having to relocate drainage and light poles. So you get 11.5ft wide lanes on the outside, instead of 13ft. As to the drain grates, I would guess that over time, water has messed up the ground around the drains causing the road around them to sag."

I plan on moving back once my contract in Belgium is up. I wasn't born and raised there, but I think I spent enough time there to comment on this question. Beware, wall of text incoming:  Bars  The Beer Garden - 84 S. Reese St., Memphis, TN 38111 - They usually have trivia on Wednesday nights and generally have different drink specials every night of the week. They only serve beer in this joint, so if you are looking for cocktails you'll have to go elsewhere. No cover unless they are doing a beer tasting or special event.  Mollie Fontaine Lounge - 679 Adams Ave, Memphis, TN 38105 - Old (well, old for the United States) Victorian house converted into a bar. Great piano bar downstairs with plenty of shabby chic chairs and sofas to lounge on. Usually pretty good electronic music upstairs. If its nice outside there is a terrace with seating to the right of the building. No cover. If LGBT people upset you, it would be best to avoid this place. http://www.molliefontainelounge.com/  Flying Saucer Draught Emporium - 130 Peabody Pl, Memphis, TN 38143 - Great selection of American craft beers and International beers. Typical bar food. Great for sitting and watching people. Waitresses in skimpy catholic school girl uniforms. Darts, billiards, usually have local bands on the weekends. No cover unless band is playing. http://www.beerknurd.com/stores/memphis/  Cooper Young area - 2120 Young Ave, Memphis, TN 38104 - Many good bars and restaurants in this area. I'd recommend parking across the street from The Beauty Shop and then you are within walking distance to each of these places. Some of my favorites are:  Young Avenue Deli - great bar with great food. http://www.youngavenuedeli.com/  Celtic Crossing - Irish pub with large outside seating area. Decent food. http://www.celticcrossingmemphis.com/  Alchemy - tapas (in my opinion they are a little pricy for what you get) but its a nice atmosphere and the drinks are decently priced. http://alchemymemphis.com/  Beauty Shop - great restaurant probably best at brunch on Sundays, chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits. http://www.thebeautyshoprestaurant.com/  Beale Street - Memphis' take on Bourbon Street although it seems much cleaner and not quite as long as Bourbon. Many blues clubs/bars. If you are downtown on the weekend you might want to take a walk down Beale Street and go into one of the bigger clubs for some authentic blues. Some of the places I've had a good time at include:  B.B. King's Restaurant & Blues Club - 143 Beale Street, Memphis, TN  Silky O'Sullivan's - 183 Beale Street, Memphis, TN  Blues City Cafe - 138 Beale Street, Memphis, TN  Beale Street Tap Room - 168 Beale St., Memphis TN  Dive Bars?  The Cove - 2559 Broad Ave, Memphis, TN 38112 - Pirate themed bar with big list of hand made cocktails. The dark and stormy is made here. Limited selection of beer. The cocktails can be quite expensive. http://www.thecovememphis.com/  Bar Dog - Great bar food. Smoking on ground level, non-smoking downstairs. I really enjoy this place, it is usually packed on the weekends. http://bardog.com/  P & H - The epitome of a dive bar. Interesting people, Old busted tables/chairs, interesting art on the walls, two or three billiards tables, small selection of beer and spirits. http://www.pandhcafe.com/  Ernestine and Hazel's - 84 E GE Patterson Ave, Memphis, TN 38103 - Former brothel turned dive bar. Decent cheeseburgers (Soul Burgers), limited selection of beer and spirits. http://www.esquire.com/bestbars/bb-ernestine-and-hazels  Food  BBQ - If you ask ten people from Memphis which place has the best barbecue you would probably get ten different responses. If you ask me, I'd say that the best bbq in Memphis can be had at Central BBQ. When ordering ribs they will usually ask you ""wet or dry?"" Memphis is known for its dry rub bbq, but if you want them wet and sloppy you can get them that way too. I generally order them dry and get some sauce on the side.  Central BBQ - 2249 Central Ave., Memphis TN - I highly recommend this place. The best bbq ribs I have ever had. I usually get a half slab dry, with fries and beans. They usually have 3 or 4 craft beers on tap and ten or so bottled beers. Once you order, go around the corner and grab some bbq sauce (I usually get the hot) and find a place to sit. They'll call out your number when your order is ready and deliver it to your table once they have located you. If its nice out, there is a deck and seating area out front. http://www.cbqmemphis.com/  Bar-B-Q Shop - 1782 Madison Ave, Memphis, Tennessee 38104 - Great bbq, probably one of the best pulled pork sandwiches out there. They also have an interesting starter that includes smoked bologna https://www.facebook.com/TheBarBQShop  Interstate BBQ - 2265 S 3rd St, Memphis, TN 38109 - Great bbq, sort of a dive, but the characters working here make it worth it. In a bit of a rough neighborhood. I'd recommend the Sampler Platter if you decide to venture out here. http://www.interstatebarbecue.com/  Rendezvous - in the alley, downstairs, behind 52 South Second in downtown Memphis - Probably the most famous bbq joint in Memphis. It really is an interesting place and has great character. While this place is the most famous, I really think the quality has gone downhill in recent years. If you are downtown and want some ribs, go check them out. http://www.hogsfly.com/TheRestaurant.php  Texas De Brazil - 150 Peabody Place, Suite 103, Memphis, TN 38103 - Brazilian steakhouse. Great selection of spirits and wine, some craft beers. Huge salad bar that comes with your meal (don't fill up too much on the salad bar!) and huge selection of meats that servers will bring by your table. Some of my favorites are lamb and flank steak. Dinner is $42.99 per person and includes the salad bar. http://texasdebrazil.com/location/memphis"

memphis,3818ig,tracyyyyyyyyyy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"The Metal Museum is pretty neat and if you call ahead you can find out when they're doing a forging or casting demonstration. I lucked out and went through on International Blacksmith Day, caught both demonstrations, and admission was free (but they run Groupons that are basically a BOGO all the time). The garden outside the museum is a great place for pictures by the river, too!   The Woodruff-Fontaine house in Victorian Village is an interesting tour if you're into that sort of thing. Last summer they did a cool tour on the first Friday of each month focusing on the architectural details/history of the home and I think they're doing it again this year. It's $10/person for the regular tour (Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 4pm), but again... Groupon's your friend."
memphis,3818ig,lolag0ddess,0,Tue Jun 2 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with the places suggested to watch fireworks. Can't go wrong with the mighty Mississippi.   Two more museum recs: the National Ornamental Metal Museum (a good one if you're staying downtown anyway!) has some excellent exhibits year-round and wonderful residencies that change. Lots of cats on the campus, too, and the blacksmith is extremely friendly if you go while he's working. Another would be the Pink Palace, which, again, has several consistent history exhibits and then specially featured things, as well as an IMAX and planetarium worth writing home about.  As far as food goes, I, too, recommend that you avoid Rendezvous in favour of Central BBQ, regardless of what anyone else tells you. I also second the Beauty Shop motion, and I'll throw in votes for Huey's (great burgers- there are several around town), Flight (downtown, extremely expensive, really good food and wine), and Tops BBQ (Central is better, but if you aren't near one, Tops will suffice).

Just to the East across Cleveland is a great neighborhood with homes that are valued between $150k and $250k. Just to the North you will find the same thing. The area to the West and South need to come up but, with the increased traffic and attractions that is now a possibility. Without that investment in the Crosstown project that would remain an impossibility. This is a great project that will improve a large chunk of Mid-Town."

I have watched the city try and do a lot of things to turn itself around and deal with the crime problem that was building up.  You know what fixed it? Not renovations, not trying to attract businesses. It was the ""cop on every corner"" initiative.  You need police to fix this city and quite frankly our leaders are giving them the finger while trying to paint over the cities problems.  You can paint a moldy wall gold but it's still going to rot.  Businesses are not the next step, police are. Businesses cant fix our problems. However if we focus on police and actually doing something about our issues then businesses will come on their own.  They don't need incentive when the city is safe and clean. They will see opportunity then instead of a risky investment."
memphis,37vgnp,akkawwakka,7,Sun May 31 07:19:41 2015 UTC,You have a good argument so I'm not going to downvote but I disagree. I moved to Memphis from Boston a few years ago. Historically gentrification results in lower crime. Gentrification happens when young professionals are incentivized to move into an area. This happens from new business. One could argue the chicken or the egg but I feel what Memphis needs is jobs - not a police state.
memphis,37vgnp,Corno4825,5,Sun May 31 10:36:41 2015 UTC,"It's a false dichotomy. It's possible to have both city-aided development (perhaps via PILOT or public-private partnership) and increases in public safety.   The problem is that much of Memphis and Shelby County do not want to pay for both and often either.   I'm not saying that MPD, or the City, could not appropriate funds more appropriately to public safety. But often in many cities in America, the onus is not just on the municipality to do more with less money (consider inflation and non-budging tax rates) — mention police or fire-fighters, and your tax increase or bond is passed without much fight."
memphis,37vgnp,totylertarian,2,Sun May 31 09:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not someone who has the education or experience necessary to run a city, but I do know that I often see police cars blatantly breaking traffic laws outside of ""lights on"" activity. I'm not saying we don't need more police enforcement, but I do believe that them following the same rules as us would be a huge step forward. It might not seem like a big deal, but if cops don't follow all the laws, why should we?"
memphis,37vgnp,GenLloyd,-1,Sun May 31 07:37:23 2015 UTC,What kind of a bullshit strawman comment is that? Some police officers don't obey silly traffic laws that you probably dislike and this is somehow a notch against hiring more police officers? That's like saying because someone's girlfriend cheated on their boyfriend I can't fathom dating. Shut up and go back to whatever hole you crawled out of.
memphis,37vgnp,candlestick,0,Sun May 31 09:16:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with police in America is a whole nother subject. Though if you really need a reason to not break the law then you can look at simple things like leading by example and being the change you want to see in the world. This isn't third grade you cant just whine and say, ""well the teacher did it so I can to!"" Well you can't if you're interested in change instead of just complaining.   I digress though,  as I said issue with the police isn't really the point. The fact is police reduce crime and I've personally seen reduced crime be significantly more effective at cleaning up a city than funding/incentiving business has. I'm sure NYC isn't the only example of this but it's the one I've been able to personally experience."
memphis,37vgnp,masterofmustaches,4,Sun May 31 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I'm just not going to get mad that the city is spending money in an effort to revitalize areas of the city. As a city tax payer, I'm on board with raising my taxes to pay the bills, but don't take away these projects that are exciting."
memphis,37vgnp,KnifehandHolsters,5,Sun May 31 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"Blaming the city for spending money on allegedly ""wasteful"" things is a more appealing political strategy than publicly demanding that the city raise more revenue (via increased taxes) to pay for redevelopment projects on top of retaining benefits for police.  The city is attempting, best I can tell, to raise more tax revenues by making the city a more attractive place for business and upper middle class residents--i.e. people and entities which pay substantial percentages of the property taxes and other taxes to fund the city.  It's an interesting gamble, and one that I hope works.  The problem is rooted in the fact that the city spent literally decades annexing as a path to increase tax revenues, and now they are unable to do so any further by state law and local ordinance. They have to seek new strategies to raise revenue to fund the city--paying teachers, paying police officers, and yes funding redevelopment projects.  They don't want to raise taxes, since that may well drive more people out of the city, and they can't recapture that tax money by annexation any further.  Thus, they want to make the city a more attractive place for people to live, and hope to raise revenue in the long term as a result.  More people = more tax dollars, even if the tax rate doesn't change. It's a complicated, dangerous dance.  As a city dweller (albeit in the annexed part of Cordova) it's also why I will be sending my kids to private school instead of the county schools.  I don't trust the funding of that school system long term.  Perhaps the city suffers in the short term due to funding woes (and it's really a shame that retired police officers are some of the first people to suffer), but in the long term I think the redevelopment initiatives will be successful.  If so, that would certainly be a very positive and likely unintended consequence of the state law preventing further annexation.  Perhaps if our leaders of the 50s through 00s had the foresight to develop what they had instead of expanding the ""rotting doughnut,"" we wouldn't be at this point now.   I've done a lot of reading about this issue recently in an effort to decide where to send my twins when they start school. Hat tip to the Flyer and CA for their numerous recent articles on the subject.  TL;DR: The city has used terrible funding strategies for decades and is now prevented from using them by state law. That has caused them to look to redevelop parts of Memphis in an effort to raise revenue in the long term, with (hopefully short term) benefits cuts being employed to bridge the gap."
memphis,37vgnp,JimJamieJames,5,Sun May 31 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"This. I would hope that a wave of fiscally responsible governance follows, though I won't hold my breath. Every department needs to be cracked open and actually audited, not for show and to give someone's cousin a contract position either. Taxpayers live here by choice. We have the income to choose to go elsewhere. I'm thankful it seems that there is a shift of focus towards attracting and retaining people like us. With that will need to be a focus on budgeting and spending within our means.   School system needs to be next. School options are a large consideration when someone is relocating their family. NONE of our transplants with kids in the office live in Memphis. There are better public options outside Memphis within commuting distance. The coworkers who did live in the city sent their kids to private school...until they took jobs out of state and moved. Not paying tuition was like an instant raise. Even the biggest Midtown cheerleaders I know send their kids to GSL and IC. Not Peabody or Central. We need to upturn the school board and gut out the admin and start fresh with people who can make the most out of every one of the billion dollars they get each year. People focused on kids and results and not excuses for failures."

memphis,37rtdb,blood_stache,5,Sat May 30 07:22:01 2015 UTC,You can climb to the top of the Lincoln American Tower downtown. There's a fire escape behind the building that can take you all the way to the top. It's my favorite rooftop.  There's also an abandoned Marine Hospital next to the Metal Museum downtown. Tbat is a great pleace to go if you can get in.  Note of advice: in Tennessee you cannot be arrested for trespassing if you have not been informed you are trespassing (this is so that people do not get in trouble for walking through farmland). If the police try to fuck with you (rarely but it happens) remain calm. Say you did not know you were trespassing. They'll tell you to leave and that's that.  Good luck!

Anyhow, memphis has a handful of abandoned buildings. The Firestone building is interesting although it's welded shut, but lots of weird stuff lying around the grounds.

How is Memphis going to deal with its underfunded Police force? No strong police presence in these places will quickly result in them being a ghost stretch. Remember the 'vitilization' of Maine St a few years ago?  What will any of this do to the thousands of under-advantaged young men/women coming up through our education system? If you expect them to just hop on the growing number of service positions that come along with these developments, try again.  Memphis has a huge population of people that are unemployable. Both black and white. If Memphis doesn't help these people, this utopian dream people seem to have for Memphis is misguided. And I mean work/training opportunities, not welfare. Social services (outside of immediate church groups) are quite lacking according to the need. You had 4000 people show up for 300 bass pro jobs the other month.  You don't get to rebuild a city and throw away a significant % of the population."

Everyone hands up in the air trying to get an angle for a video. I would have hated to be behind all of them trying to just watch the funeral. I guess one cool thing to look forward to in the future will be consolidating all of the different footage and creating a 3d playback from all the different angles.

memphis,37lgr1,AHathcock,7,Thu May 28 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"If you like ice cream, La Michiocana is a local Mexican ice cream and concessions shop run by 3 brothers.  I'd recommend the location near Summer and Graham. It caters largely to the local Hispanic community, but it's run by the youngest brother, Rafa, and he speaks the best English and is very outgoing and friendly. If you tell him what you're doing, he probably be more than happy to help you out if he has the time. I wouldn't approach him when he's swamped with customers though, and he does get very busy during the summer. I think they open around 11 AM, so going there around opening time on a weekday might be the slowest time for business, and he's likely to be more energetic. If you go in the evening, he's been up since 4 AM making ice cream, so he's not going to be as chipper."

However I believe that this is very likely also the case with non-technical meet ups as well. This is the one response where it's completely understandable and as a meet up organizer, it's hard to push back against this.  I think that one of the things meet up organizers could do better is marketing. I certainly struggle with it despite spending a lot of time in the marketing field early in my technical career. It often feels like events on meetup.com just aren't getting the reach and/or exposure of other events. Maybe because these events aren't making the papers / media outlets?"

memphis,37h2xv,mjxa1,3,Wed May 27 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Driver's Permit? If so, I'd say when I took it (11 years ago), the information about alcohol limits and DUI punishments was stuff you should study.   Go ahead and study. You don't want to have to retake it. The excitement of finally getting to drive is pretty big at that age. Most of it is straightforward if you have parents that teach you about driving, but you never know what you don't know. Play it safe."
memphis,37h2xv,SrEllipsis,2,Wed May 27 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Most of the written bit IS common sense, but it is still important to study just like you would for any other exam. Just grab a copy of the study materials and read through them a couple of times. If there are areas that seem like truly ""common sense"" to you then skim those parts and focus on the new information or anything that has to do with alcohol/DUI and also signage. Also, I'm not sure which ""big ass book"" you're talking about but here is Tennessee's Driver's Handbook on which the test is based: handbook. It's not that big.  Bottom line: take the test seriously and study for it like you would anything else."

memphis,37e2kf,Crash_Recovery,2,Wed May 27 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"I don't have a child, but I do have a degree in Education. If I had a child, I would place him/her in a Reggio Emilia based school.. or Montessori. I know from students that I've taught that the first couple years in school are so highly important. It makes learning so much easier. (I teach in an urban school in the city) I don't know how much they cost and it seems that the only Reggio Emilia school is a ""lab"" school out of the University of Memphis. I had to learn about all of the different methods of teaching during my program, and I loved the RE based school. It teaches the children to really become life-long learners and to discover the world on their own. The one I visited in Atlanta was really neat. Basically, the children come up with what they want to learn, what interest them etc. and then the teachers fit it within the standards and teach it. For example, the children decided that they wanted to learn about butterflies because it was spring and they were seeing them all in their environment. So, the teachers then taught about the life-cycle, the symmetry, and involved books about butterflies. It is just a very interesting approach to education that I think is beneficial to all children. They learn to be thinkers.    http://www.examiner.com/article/alternative-education-focus-on-reggio-emilia   I don't know how old your child is, but the fees seem to fit within your budget. https://www.memphis.edu/lipman/fees.htm   Also, I just moved here from ATL. I am in no way endorsing the program that they offer. I just like the approach to education and it's the only RE based school I found in the area :]"

memphis,37e70e,Flabs_Mangina,4,Wed May 27 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"Like another poster said, trash pickup doesn't cover tires. You've got to take them yourself to a hazardous waste disposal place with really limited hours. Smaller tire shops in the city will dump them illegally to avoid having to pay a disposal fee, even though they charge one for every tire sold.  The city will hold a tire collection event where they pay about a dollar each for old tires, but it runs out of funds in a day or so. When that happens, the tires start being dumped again.   The county has set up covert cameras in dumping hot spots and has had some luck catching them on film. I'm not sure why the city hasn't done this, beyond the trailer cams with blue lights flashing."

They aren't connected to wheels, so my husband thinks that people are too cheap to pay the tire disposal fee when they get new tires AND/OR tire places are just dumping them as well.  We saw them only in the 240 loop and south of it. none in germantown, collierville, etc. Saw plenty in midtown and CY. Obviously saw them in the not so great neighborhoods of Orange Mound, Hickory Hill, Berclair(though we did like some parts of Berclair).   The one in-town neighborhood we saw ZERO tires in was Colonial Acres. This ended up being our favorite neighborhood and I think we will look for a house to rent there when we move to memphis in a few months."

MIM president Jim Holt announced in March that the event would be replaced in 2016 with something aimed at a larger, more diverse audience.

Upper management job sounds like you will make a decent salary and the cost of living here is wonderful. Plus, no state income tax! (9.25% sales tax though)  Crime here is not much different than other big cities, be smart and know your surroundings is just common sense. Socially, midtown and downtown are booming right now with bars, restaurants, and attractions. My biggest gripe with the city right now is that we're in the early phases of multi-year interstate construction which can really screw your commute.   Have you visited before? If not, I suggest finding an air bnb in midtown or downtown and using uber to get around. It'll give you a good feel for the place."

memphis,36tu19,DaveLambert,8,Sun May 24 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"Moving from DFW is that means anything.    I moved here to Memphis from Houston in 1988, when I was 22.  Found a wife here (our 19-year anniversary is coming up), we've raised a son here (he's 17).  I haven't regretted it. Great friends, great food, right balance of ""big city"" vs. ""small town,"" great cost of living, always something to do, always some ""getaway"" spot (urban or natural) available within a few hours if you want to spend a weekend (or more) out of the city.  I live just barely outside the city limits of both Memphis and Germantown. I enjoy my neighborhood well enough; no regrets.    Racial tension?  Sure, not much different than I saw growing up in Texas.  The racial epithets are the same (for that matter the LGBT fear level is about the same, too, but Memphis has a terrific LGBT community which does a lot of civil rights work).  The city leaders and county leaders play the race card a bit more during elections and maybe during council meetings, but I don't see a big difference from the Lone Star State. The block I live on is VERY racially mixed, with blacks and whites and browns and all. We all get along just fine. No Asians on our block that I can think of right now, but I know plenty nearby, including one of my wife's best friends at work...they don't seem to have any big problems to get along. If you like home-cooking ""international"" food, there are plenty of markets of all sizes that sell what you're looking for.    Crime?  Absolutely, but I've never actually been a victim of it personally because I was born in NYC and grew up in Houston and like any city dweller I take precautions and stay aware of my surroundings.  Bad traffic?  I have family in DFW and visit them all the time, and DFW and Houston are WAY WAY worse than Memphis; you'll consider this town a breeze (besides, unlike the Metroplex you can actually get ANYwhere in Memphis or vicinity within roughly a half hour, give or take).    Religion? They're all represented here, but being in the Bible Belt of course Jesus takes precedence.  A friend once commented to me that there's more churches in Memphis than gas stations, and I've never seen a thing to make me believe that isn't true.  We've got 'em here, of all sizes...even ""mall-sized"".  Then there's this thing (ugh). There's also a Jewish Community Center and various temples, several Mosques, Bhuddists, you name it.  Or, if you're an irreligious heathen like me, well, it IS hard to escape all the Jesus constantly mentioned in the area, but you'll get by. This past Easter weekend a national convention of Atheists was held in town. Or if you're into more ""alt"" entertainments that most religious people avoid (think goth parties, and monthly Rocky Horror Picture Show, and bellydance and/or non-nude burlesque, etc.), people don't always realize it but Memphis has plenty of that, too. It's just not as obvious.    When my job (at the time) moved me from Houston to Memphis (it was 27 years ago last month) my friends in Houston put on horrified looks and asked me things like, ""is this something you WANT to do?""  I did.  And I do.  I had no idea back then what a concrete jungle Houston was, and I think DFW is largely the same way.  And both so huge and sprawling.  Memphis is the right size for me, and the right amount of ""thick groves of trees in random parts of town.""  When I go visit my relatives in the DFW area, I always drive through Rockwall, TX and then past Lake Ray Hubbard just outside Dallas...it's gorgeous, and last time I asked my family if they ever visit it. They never heard of it. I told them where it is; ""that's too far away.""  Yeah, I guess...it IS almost an hour from where they live near FW.  The Metroplex is just so BIG. Memphis is much more cozy.    Your mileage may vary, of course. Keep in mind that I'm white, closing in on my 50th birthday, and born Jewish (but haven't been religious since I was 9). Before I moved here to Memphis, I spent a week visiting the city and seeing if I liked what I saw.  The company I worked for at the time footed the bill (and charged it to ""apartment/house hunting"").  Whether yours foots the bill or not, I recommend you visit and see if you like what you see.  Good luck!    TL;DR - Memphis may not be for everybody, but I've lived more than half my life here after moving from Texas, and I have zero regrets."

Love the South Main area about the Arcade Diner, which I walk to from my place a lot.    Some dude walking by told me ""Ni Hao"" the other day, which is the most racist thing that's happened so far, but I think he was trying to be polite, as crazy as that sounds.  Also I'm not Chinese.  I still walk everywhere and it's seemed fine so far.  There are definitely areas that have that vibe warning you to turn around and walk back the way you came... so I just listen to that vibe.  Used to get the same thing in Brooklyn too, so it's no different than any other city.  I've stuck Downtown for the majority of our stay here.  Been to Overton Sq a bit and like it too.  Haven't really hung out in Cooper-Young yet.  So far those are the areas I'm familiar with... well that and Poplar Plaza, which is like, a commercial development.  The Downtown bars / restaurants are all great so far, people are nice and talkative.  Food has been really good too."

Just keep in mind you're in a city and just be alert - like how you would if you were in another city like New York or Philadelphia. There are bad parts and there are good parts. So just avoid the bad parts if you can. It's easy to determine where the bad parts are when you're here.    Source: I'm Asian American and I live in Memphis."

It can make things incredibly uncomfortable."

Memphis is a city with soul. In any city you'll find what you look for but I think Memphis has a lot of great stuff to find."
memphis,36tu19,jojotoughasnails,4,Fri May 22 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"Shelby Farms is awesome. I take my 2 dogs there a lot. It's off leash though, so obviously your dogs need to be trained. The issue is the dog park is out in Cordova which is outside Memphis. As a young single dude, you'll probably want to live in Midtown or Downtown. You can always head over to Overton Bark for some fenced in dog fun.  Speaking of outdoors stuff, I'm assuming Texas is very dry heat. Well, pop some motherfucking Allegra bro, you're in for a wild ride. Memphis has lots of mosquitoes and hella bad allergies. I never had an allergy issue until I moved here. Also, special note, that means for your AND your dogs. I'm a vet tech and regularly see dogs for allergy related issues. Just a heads up that all that might happen.  Don't let anyone here tell you crime isn't a big deal. They're just ignorant because it hasn't happened to them. Statistically Memphis has some of the highest crime rates in the country. Be smart. Keep a clean car. Don't walk alone at night. Don't trust strangers. I'm sure I'll get a shitload of downvotes for saying this stuff, but I'm just trying to look out for you. There are people here who will prey on someone like you for money or to rob you.  Like I said, Midtown or Downtown is probably where you'll want to live. That's where all the most popular events are. Also all the breweries and more restaurants than you'd ever want. There's a huge variety too."

For example University of Memphis will be renovating their rec center and will have a full boulder and rock climbing wall. We already have a boulder wall at the University of Tennessee Health and Science Center.   The diversity isn't so bad in certain neighborhoods. I would say stick to University district as it would be central location for your prime interests. I.E Overton Park (running, dog park, open field), and Shelby Farms Park (mountain biking, kayaking, running), and the Mississippi River (Kayaking). Living in the University district you won't be far from most places. Depending on your job you could even bike there. This is probably the biggest issue with Memphis. Public transportation. The city pretty much seems themselves as car-dependant. Crime isn't bad as your learn to stay away from sketchy areas, and know where to go, and where not to go.   Where is your job at?"
memphis,36tu19,JosukeHigashikata,2,Fri May 22 08:19:22 2015 UTC,"I have loved living in Memphis. Moved here three years ago from Charleston, SC- arguably one of the better cities in the US.  Frankly, we'd do it all over again.  Best thing about Memphis to me is Midtown-- Overton Park, the Levitt Shell, Overton Square, Broad Street, Cooper Young-- there's always something going on, and the people here are so friendly, if a little self-depreciating about their city.  As with any move, you're in for some changes.  But keep the right attitude, and you'll love it here."
memphis,36tu19,George_PopaDopalous,3,Fri May 22 12:15:04 2015 UTC,"Ask people in real life what they think of Memphis. This sub is not likely to give a representative sample. Anyone who says crime is a problem is likely to be downvoted, and anyone who say crime is not a problem is likely to be upvoted.   Second piece of advice: don't trust opinions from anyone who lives outside Memphis, unless you plan to live exactly where they live. Their experiences (likely) won't map with the experiences of people who actually live in Memphis.  Pure personal opinion, not backed with objective evidence: Memphis has good qualities, mainly due to people who work tirelessly to make it a better place. But it also has tragic, abject poverty, along with all the problems that can bring. The government is ineffectual (whether that's due to corruption or limited funds I'll leave to others to decide). The takeaway: Memphis is a largely unpleasant place to live, unless you manage to find geographic pockets of niceness and also memorize all the safe tunnels between them. Out of the many people I've known who left Memphis, zero have regretted leaving. Most have been overjoyed.  But it's a great place to visit."

memphis,36tu19,unloose_the_moose,1 point,Fri May 22 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just be careful when driving around neighborhoods near the city. The one thing about Memphis is that you can be relatively close to a nice or decent neighborhood, but if you accidentally make a wrong turn, you could very easily end up in a bad neighborhood . I don't know if it's the same in other cities (I was raised 20 minutes outside memphis and I haven't really visited any other cities)"
memphis,36tu19,ChainBlue,2,Sun May 24 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference from moving from a large city to Memphis. I live downtown and also moved from a large city. The population density is very different. Whereas in a big city most parking will be underground, and the buildings above will generally have retail/restaurants on the first 2 floors and high rises with office space/condos on top of retail. Unbelievable, but there are still surface parking lots in prime downtown locations such as the lot between Beale/Peabody and Front/S Main. Good news is that parking rarely exceeds $20. Walkability is a major issue, much of it is not walkable and you really need a car to get around. Public transportation is very limited to a bus system and a trolley route which only runs downtown. For example there isn't a true grocery store downtown (City Market & Miss Cordelia's may do in a pinch) but you'll going to need a car. Outside of downtown, midtown is about as developed and walkable as a suburb of a larger city.   This place is about 15 years behind other cities as far as restaurants/retail and a lot of familar chains, that you probably take for granted because they were so ubiquitous. They won't be found nearby and are in short supply. (i.e. there's not one Chipotle within the Memphis loop as opposed to one on every other corner, a grand total of one Starbucks downtown (in a hotel), not many national burger joints such as Shake Shack although there is one 5 Guys within the loop, only one Whole Foods in the entire city, one Pei Wei within the loop, no hotels that cater to millennials with money such as the W) Although, we've been neglected nationally the city does a decent job of imitating things in other cities, for example homegrown burger places like Oshii, LBOE and Bellyacres etc. The BBQ is second to none in this city.  The good news is that this city is CHEAP. I was in a similar position of leaving a larger city and am paid very well. I took a $40k paycut to come to Memphis and can live way better here than in a larger city. With an upper management job even earning in the neighborhood of 100k, you can live large instead of struggling in larger more expensive cities. It's a very poor city and can be tough to find places to spend money on. If you like fine dining, options are limited (Can you tell I like food?) Very few restaurants if any will be found on national top 250 lists. Also with upper management salaries it's financially easy to fly out of the city to do things nationally restaurants, entertainment etc. However, it's often hard to get direct flights. For example, I love seeing a lot of bands that don't come through Memphis (hardly anyone stops here except for rap and country acts). I'll travel 8-10 times a year to see bands, but if I want to go to smaller places (Austin, Asheville, Charleston it can be time consuming due to lack of flights not like DFW at all). Chicago, Atlanta, NY, DC, Houston, DFW are easier flights. Don't know if you're planning on buying but property taxes are high here (1.8-2%) as well. Traffic is nonexistent compared to larger cities.  That's most of the culture shock, although I've found that the average person is very religious down here compared to anywhere I've been outside of the Middle East. There are some seriously massive churches out in the suburbs and seems to play a part in a lot of people's lives. People also don't seem to have a lot of life experience such as living in places outside of the U.S. South as well. Maybe people have limited experiences living in places like Nashville or Atlanta but not outside the culture of the U.S. South. It's not an international city. You'll find no chinatown or immigrant population areas of the city.  Crime is kind of strange in that it doesn't take place just in bad neighborhoods but kind of all over the city. Some places are better than others of course, but no public place is immune or multi year rare like in other cities.   Hope this helps. It is very different than a large city!"

I've been on U-verse, my parents have been on Comcast, about 10 minutes down the road from me. My service is rock solid. Theirs...not so much. It is a lot faster, when it works. It's usually a temporary outage, that of course Comcast CS knows nothing about. I decided to stick with reliability. And the ping is a lot better than it used to be. I'm seeing 30ms over wifi/N and 25-28 wired. Sure not the 100+ ms I used to see on plain DSL.  And I can't believe I'm saying this about AT&T, but the CS and technician experience has been better. They had a 'lead' tech for the install, but 2-3 others showed up during the course of the day to handle various tasks. The lead didn't leave until everything was working, and I was getting advertised speeds. And generally, as long as I don't have all 3 tv receivers on, I'll usually get 15-16Mbit instead of the 12 I'm actually subscribed for."

memphis,36rk1f,Sleepytitan,2,Thu May 21 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree.   Ever since switching from Comcast to U-Verse, I've found that the internet almost always works. It's more likely that my router or my U-verse box is not working if my internet isn't working.   Comcast would go out all the fucking time and it honestly got tiresome to deal with.

Their phone service is a mess to navigate, and once I got a service rep my call was dropped 9 times from two different phones.  HBO subscriptions have mysteriously appeared on my bill, despite the fact that I don't have cable.  Finally, save yourself a few headaches and just buy your own modem and router.

Try downloading a large file and see what speed you're is while downloading it.  Steam games are pretty good for this.  Also if you live in a densely populated area and you try to test it during peak hours you probably won't get that higher speed.  I've also found that Comcast will throttle my speed if I have torrents running.
memphis,36ncgt,arojay,1 point,Thu May 21 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"I went here (http://www.thinkbroadband.com/download.html) and downloaded the 100MB test file.  It took 1:16 which would equate to around 15ish MB or so.  I don't have any torrents running, but I do watch Netflix / SlingTV some.  Not while running the tests, though.  EDIT: I do live in a condo complex, but I'm at home right now as I test, so I don't think it would be anywhere near Peak time."
memphis,36ncgt,thadood,1 point,Wed May 20 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust the speeds off of that site. I just tried it, and was getting under 1Mbit/sec with lots of stalling. Tested downloading a game off of Steam a few minutes ago, and was getting 50-60."
memphis,36ncgt,thadood,1 point,Wed May 20 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"OK. Will give that a shot, too."
memphis,36ncgt,xykotech,2,Wed May 20 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"How are you testing your speeds? Are you wired or wireless when testing?   Don't trust Speedtest's first result - you will want to pick another provider to test through (I recommend Softlayer in Dallas).  If you're on wireless for this test, your results will be all over the place, for the most part.  Let us know: Your computer type and how it connects to your network. The modem model, and your router model."
memphis,36ncgt,xykotech,1 point,Wed May 20 20:37:06 2015 UTC,"I tried speedtest.net as well as the comcast provided speedtest.  Computer is a Dell studio of some sort, it as an intel 2 quad cpu  q9550 @ 2.83 ghz with a realtek gigabit adapter.  Modem is a Motorola Surfboard 6141.  Router is a Linksys/Cisco RVS4000 gigabit router.  I'm testing with the PC connected to the Cisco device which is connected to the modem.  I tested the Comcast site at Memphis to try to get as close as possible.  Speedtest and Softlayer showed speeds a little slower, which I would expect."
memphis,36ncgt,xykotech,4,Wed May 20 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"Last-ditch effort is to plug right up to the modem, allow it to grab an IP, and test that way. Comcast will attempt to blame everything that's not from them as the cause of the issue. They're going to have you try this when you try to get support, anyway.  If that fails to get close to your advertised speed, I'd then begin the process with Comcast - recording it every step of the way."
memphis,36ncgt,xykotech,1 point,Wed May 20 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Was going to try that, too. Just wanted to get confirmation that it is supposed to be 50/10 and other people are getting close to that."

memphis,36pnnh,_manoftheyear_,1 point,Thu May 21 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"No one with a TS is going to discuss anything that has been declassified. Why?  A) If it's been declassified you don't need some one with a TS to discuss it, so some one with a TS is going to know that you don't need them and you searching for them specifically is a red flag.  B) There's a term, I think it's called agitation of information, or something like that. Basically, declassified information can be dangerous when aggregated or given too many details. Anyone with a TS knows this and won't be willing to share too much.  C) TS is good for 5 years and costs six figures (government pays) to get. The time and research that goes into it is pretty extensive. So people who have it know how valuable it is and how easy it is to lose. They're not going to be sharing too much info with internet strangers.  Then again it is the Navy, so if it involves SEALs just wait for the book to come out on it. And oh yea, ISIS is known to use the internet, so only an idiot would give any information. And in case you're wondering, no I don't ahve a TS and I am not stationed in Millington. I'm not even in the Navy."
memphis,36pnnh,CaptainInsane-o,0,Fri May 22 15:14:26 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Im simply looking to compare information. I would know if someone was bullshitting me or not.

memphis,36jtzq,ebo113,2,Tue May 19 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"In my experience 700-800 for anything more than a 1 bedroom is going to be hard in Collierville. I think it has a lot to do with the school district, people are willing to pay a premium to get in that system. 900-1100 is a little more accurate. I'm not familiar with specific apartments or rentals in that area of town, since I live in midtown. I'm in a 3br duplex near Overton Square and I pay $700 but that's not typical."
memphis,36jtzq,tracyyyyyyyyyy,2,Wed May 20 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"A 2 BR in Collierville is probably going to be on the high side of your budget. Here are some prices from a quick look around:   Addison at Collierville - $966-$1,034 Lincoln on the Green - $870-$1,175 Dogwood Creek - $1,000-$1,195 Preserve at Forest Creek - $1,004-$2,509   Even the Craiglists searches are pricey.   As others have said, you might be better off looking elsewhere. If you prefer living in a vibrant area with lots to see and do, I'd suggest moving somewhere west of Collierville, more in the midtown area, as others have said. However, if you don't mind living in the middle of nowhere, you could head south to Mississippi:   The Plantation - $815-$865 Southwind Lakes - $705-$899 The Vineyard - $885-$1,015"
memphis,36jtzq,grumblichu,2,Wed May 20 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"For 990 you can get a deluxe 2 bed/2 bath apartment at Legacy Farms in Collierville. My SO and I lived there for 5 years. The grounds are kept nice, the apartments are pretty decent quality, and the neighbors are friendly for the most part. We had what they called the ""magnolia"" floor plan. The kitchen was huge and even had a built in island. It's definitely the nicest apartment I've lived in. It is much nicer than the Madison down the road.   I'd recommend it if you're able to adjust your budget upwards a bit."
memphis,36jtzq,MizzippiRivah,4,Thu May 21 12:44:59 2015 UTC,"I recommend Midtown. It's much cheaper than Collierville, and I also commute to the Germantown/Collierville area M-F for work.    Not really realistic.. You're looking at closer to $1000 for rent in Collierville. Town home would definitely not be possible, unless you look at places around midtown.  Yes! High rises like Bryton Tower, Duplexes on and around Peabody Ave, Cooper Young Depends on how social you are. I like to just chill at home by myself, but there are plenty of bars, restaurants, and parks in midtown.Just go exploring :P"

I first noticed Tim several years ago when he and Kevin Rose did the ""Random Show"".  I'm a big fan of Tim's - he provides awesome tips for improving yourself - mind, body, life goals, etc.    You're the same person who recommended ""Choose Yourself"" by James Altucher.  Because of that, I actually checked out his blog, and ended up ordering several of his books off Amazon - I am almost finished with ""Choose Yourself"".  So - thanks for that book recommendation.  Again, I can't recommend Stitcher enough if you have a long commute - you can download the podcasts offline and listen to them during your drive - their android app is great.

Roll stop tickets are a big thing out here too.  Also, the Kroger will be undergoing a minor remodel and reset starting in 10 days.   It won't be as outdated as it seems now!

In fact, they are still making minor changes to our plans for the minor one they are starting in a little over a week.    Honestly, I doubt it given the consumer base in the area and growth potential.   However, there will be a marketplace(what you're talking about) built relatively close soon.   They are working on the final permits/land issues now.    Our concern is that this will hurt our sales & growth potential, so the 2018 target date may be pushed back/expansion scaled down.   My bet would be on a slightly smaller version of the Lakeland(Stonebridge) store given the circumstances.   This could all easily change should the situation change, if businesses begin to invest more in the area and people start moving out here at a faster rate, we could very well see a marketplace in the next 5ish years.   We do have enough land to build it should the situation arise."

memphis,35zwi5,hotchie,2,Thu May 14 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"I did it there a few years ago, and it was super easy. When I went there was no traffic, and the route was a large square around the center. My two difficulties were in making sure I was going the speed limit before hitting the speed limit's sign and not merging into the turn lane without crossing the lines. That was okay though, that kind of driving was understandable to the instructor because getting in the turn lane and not blocking traffic in the joining lane is necessary in Memphis."
memphis,35zwi5,goruck,1 point,Fri May 15 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's stupid easy. You make 2 right turns and one left and that about how difficult the test is. I did it in a time of day with little traffic, so I guess that helped but it is likely easy regardless."
memphis,35zwi5,crazychrisc,1 point,Fri May 15 05:15:13 2015 UTC,This post has given me a ripe chuckle. It's easy. I'm assuming it must be easy... because everyone in Memphis who drives is FUCKING TERRIBLE. I can't fathom how half the people here have a license with how BAD they drive.  They practically give you a license.
memphis,35zwi5,CrimsonEngage,3,Fri May 15 07:38:44 2015 UTC,"Story time!   I ran slightly off the road during my road test and still passed.  The instructor was on her cell phone during the exam. Her response to me nearly running us into a ditch was, ""Girl, don't you run us into that ditch."" I told a friend of the family who worked at the DMV and she flipped shit and the lady ended up getting fired. Turns out being on your phone during an exam is way super not legit.    So yeah.. they'll give nearly anyone a license. We still drive better than Missifuckinssippi, though."

Lit-up dance floor, fog machines, usually brings in a pretty good ratio of men:women if y'all want to get down  -Awesome BBQ (tons on that in this sub) or one of my personal favorites, Gus's Fried Chicken  -A really cool bar district is Overton Square in midtown, this area is really on the rise and is located really close to ANOTHER bar district called Cooper-Young  If y'all are into gambling, Memphis is about 45 minutes north of Tunica, MS.  Tunica is the 3rd largest gambling destination in the US after Vegas and Atlantic City.  All your casino staples and free drinks while you're playing at the tables/machines.  [EDIT to add:]  If y'all are driving, there are some pretty decent municipal golf courses that might be a good way to fill an afternoon.  Also, Bass Pro Shop just opened their massive new store in the Pyramid which used to host Grizzlies games.  Haven't been there yet myself but it's definitely a bro-chill spot.

That can make for some long travel days. As a consultant myself I find it adds on average 2-3 hours to any flight depending on layover times."
memphis,35y1i3,baxtelf,3,Thu May 14 14:08:01 2015 UTC,Wow they really HAVE cut back since Delta yanked their hub. They used to have a direct to Milwaukee but that must have recently gone away.
memphis,35y1i3,baxtelf,2,Thu May 14 14:44:01 2015 UTC,They have basically gone from a 3 concourse airport to 1 now. It's really sad to see all that empty space when you are there. Delta has some flights to their other hubs but not many.

Were you planning on living out in the Germantown area or in Memphis proper?  One thing to do is check with neighbors in areas you are looking into and ask about their Internet service. We only have Comcast and AT&T for residential better in Memphis so their motivation for good service is nil. Since I'm summing you'll be doing a lot of remote access, make sure that your particular internet gets decent service. Where I live is fine, but where I work we've been having AT&T techs come out at least once a month for the past year trying to figure out why our connection is constantly dropping out.  Less of an issue (sort of) if you don't do a lot of remoting in.  But yeah, what section of town were you looking to live in/what do you want in a neighborhood?"
memphis,35y1i3,Rusty-S,2,Thu May 14 16:26:35 2015 UTC,awesome suggestion.  Where I live we can only get Comcast/Xfinity and the internet is mediocre and we sometimes wish we could get a hold of AT&T just to test it out.
memphis,35y1i3,shoppedpixels,4,Thu May 14 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"I work in IT and work from home when I am not flying off to do installs/upgrades/training. We have a 2200sqft house in Southaven Snowden Grove neighborhood and our house note is $1000/mo. I am 6 minutes from the Church rd I55 exit and 16 minutes from driveway to airport parking lot. Flight schudle and prices aren't as good as the city we moved from (Nashville) but when I compare to my coworkers in Cinci and Minneapolis they are close to same price. Snowden Grove park has concerts and festivals and kids baseball. Lots of nearby shopping, food and grocery options. less than 10 minutes away Desoto Civic Center gets concerts and minor league hockey and a new outlet mall is being built right next to it.  We drive into town every weekend to go to Zoo or Children's Museum, 25-30 minutes away. Stax is right off the interstate so it is real easy to hit (about 20 minutes from our area of southaven)  Or you could move to Nashville, better flight schedule and they are getting google fiber ;)"

memphis,35y1i3,Rusty-S,2,Thu May 14 16:30:10 2015 UTC,Nashville's becoming the opposite of Memphis in that it's easier to find several $k/month than it is not. A few areas are still affordable but it's changing quickly.

memphis,35w6eg,trolljoy,8,Thu May 14 05:21:23 2015 UTC,my father used to take me to the spring river every summer for our annual father/daughter canoe trip. Just a day on the river. Just the two of us. Our last trip was in 98. Best trip ever because it was the first time we didn't tip over! Great memories. He died on the way home in a car accident. Haven't been back since.  The camping sucks though. It's just pulling up your car and putting your tent next to it and the neighbor car next to you.   But the canoeing was fun and easy.

memphis,35tvcb,vikrum2083,2,Wed May 13 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"Do a google search for local private ambulance companies.

For starters:   Med-care ambulance Medic One Pro-Med Ambulance EMHC Rural Metro First Call   There are others, I just cant remember them. I was a paramedic for years, and dealt with ambulances breaking down constantly. Something like this would be right up their alley if you could market it to them. Most also have wheel chair vans for wheel chair bound patients.   Once you have a proven track record with smaller services, moving to something like Memphis Fire or Nashville Fire would net you big numbers, because then you start to look at fire trucks, ambulances, rescue vehicles, etc..

memphis,35pa0l,Ravenfall7,11,Tue May 12 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"It is basically an issue with food vendor laws. To sell food, each team would need to register as a food vendor, which no one wants to do for just one weekend. Each team provides food to the judges, and then has their own little party in their tent all weekend.  Instead, what it is is basically a giant mobile block party. Imagine you're in college and on a street with a bunch of fraternity houses all having parties. You can get into the parties and drink at the places where you know members, but the rest if them are like ""sorry, you have to have a brother vouch for you.""  Chances are you know someone on a team, or multiple people. Ask around at work if anyone is on a team and ask if you can get in to their tent. It is like 10 dollars to get into the fest and it is fun to look at booths, but the main point is getting into one or two tents and hanging out where they have food and drinks."

memphis,35pa0l,BWright79,1 point,Tue May 12 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't complicated, really.  To sell food to the public, especially food cooked on site, you have to be licensed to do so. That means health inspections and such.  Now, a team can give you food, without any issues whatsoever. They just can't sell it to you. But obviously, teams are large deals, and it is very expensive to have one. The ""you can't eat there"" mantra is basically to prevent people from being assholes and asking teams for free BBQ. And yes, people do that and get very jerky when you tell them no. On the other hand, if you're a nice person, and express interest in the team's booth design, and are polite, then somebody might invite you in the tent during the day, and maybe let you sample the food if we have any on hand. It's all about how nice you are to whomever's guarding the door.  For reference, I'm on a shoulder team, have been for 9 years. Our budget is in excess of $25k. So, there's no real incentive for teams to spend a bunch of money and just give away product. They have lots of members who paid a couple hundred bucks each to be on that team and who contribute to it. They may have corporate sponsorship. So, those people get first crack at it.  Teams aren't vendors, they're teams. This year, three of them went through the hassle and can actively sell to the public. Most teams don't see the point, why go to all the trouble of becoming a restaurant for a weekend?  If you want to eat good 'que, spend the money and join a team. It's not hard."

memphis,35qhlx,KnifehandHolsters,7,Tue May 12 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"The city owns both properties. It'd be like charging yourself and paying yourself. The nonprofits that manage both have this agreement, but I'm not sure if the Overton Park Conservancy bothered to ask for a donation or fee for use. Doesn't sound like it. Maybe an oversight on their part. Seems like an option that should be considered if the field will continue to be used.   The zoo still has a number of acres allocated to them that remain undeveloped. ""Just build a garage!"" ...except much of the remaining acreage is old growth forest. The garage at the square is a bit too far for anything but overflow. No one wants to walk that far or wait for buses in the heat. Convenience plays into admission receipts.   Right now, it is either mow down old growth or park in a field. Which sucks, considering. Really wish the zoo had gone through with a move way back when I-40 was going to bisect the area. They are landlocked and part of the game to keep income up is an ever evolving array of new exhibits. Those need space they don't have, but they are far too invested in their current location to pack up for the burbs."
memphis,35qhlx,CrimsonEngage,2,Tue May 12 21:23:09 2015 UTC,I'm not going to sign. It's not the Zoo. The Zoo isn't forcing people to park there. People are parking there because they feel like it.

memphis,35qhlx,jojotoughasnails,0,Tue May 12 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Did you read the petition? Not parking on greensward is not the only issue. There is the issue of how they will handle parking when new exhibits are opened, as new exhibits bring more people. There is the removal of the Chickasaw Trail fencing and entire planned exhibit that they took 17 acres of forested land from the park. There is also the issue of concealing the Teton Trek exhibit as the back end is visible to park users and unpleasant to look at. There are other issues addressed as well.   Also, from your link, it will only cut down on parking on the Greensward, not remove it entirely. People don't want partial improvement. We want parking banned on the Greenswards entirely.   ""The 350 new parking spaces would not eliminate zoo overflow parking on a part of the Overton Park greensward that prompted protests last spring and summer.""  They say it will be allowed 60 days of the year, but that still won't keep from ruining the park grounds, especially if it rains anywhere around the same time as people are allowed to park there. I get that Wharton made a promise to eventually end all parking there, but he has backed out on his promise regarding this issue once already. So yeah, people are keeping on the issue."
memphis,35qhlx,pilotmkn,2,Tue May 12 19:00:39 2015 UTC,It takes time. There's been tons of meetings and discussions to figure out what the zoo needs to do to permanently handle the parking. Maybe consider joining the overton park conservancy?

I mean it's at a damn brewery and people getting drunk playing corn hole eating tacos. Sorry for the punctuation I'm a lil buzzed right now

This group means so much to these folks, and it would be such a loss to see it go away. I got to spend some time with the groups as I filmed, and it was really powerful to see the members helping each other read and talk about the books. They all loved the book, ""Marley and Me"" and it was really cool to hear about them talk about how it made them feel and what it was like to read it together. As you can probably imagine, there are a lot of programs for adults with disabilities, but they are incredibly expensive. This is one of the most accessible and free programs in the city for these folks. Anyways, please consider throwing them a few dollars--$5 would buy a book for a member.   Thank you all so much!"

I was actually disappointed when I moved down here to find out there's only the Greek, Italian and Indian fest (ones that I know of/have been heavily advertised).  It's partially due to the fact that most people in the South aren't from large ethnic groups anymore (very rarely you find large clusters down here of Polish, Russian, Armenian etc communities) since this area isn't where they settled when they immigrated - they went to industry cities like Pittsburgh and New York and Philly, etc."

Get the Joyce Roll(cooked). If you're willing to do raw fish, Nathan, Sunset, Quasimodo, and Sexy Lady(pay extra to add cream cheese, trust me). If cooked rolls only, I'd go Mexico, Volcano, and aforementioned Joyce.  All the $10+ rolls are humongous btw. I usually go with my gf and we order three rolls. Most people won't be able to finish more than one. So I'd order a bunch and share."
memphis,359n5i,AHappyMeal,2,Fri May 8 07:23:17 2015 UTC,Cream cheese on the Sexy Lady?! Gross. That roll is perfect as is!
memphis,359n5i,caramelbologna,2,Fri May 8 13:37:49 2015 UTC,That is the first one I order.  Every time.
memphis,359n5i,saki1338,1 point,Sat May 9 03:05:42 2015 UTC,You HAVE to try the peanut butter sauce if you get the Joyce roll.
memphis,359n5i,Argetxo,1 point,Fri May 8 07:57:12 2015 UTC,Yup.  Sakura germantown is about as legit as it gets.
memphis,359n5i,CaptainInsane-o,1 point,Fri May 8 13:02:51 2015 UTC,The garland roll! We also like the Sakura roll. It's very similar to a shrimp tempura roll but has more stuff. Great.. Now I want sushi...
memphis,359n5i,aca901,1 point,Fri May 8 21:33:23 2015 UTC,Thank you for the recommendation!  We went to Sakura and holy crap you weren't kidding about the roll sizes!
memphis,359n5i,AHappyMeal,1 point,Mon May 11 06:56:23 2015 UTC,Yea no problem. Glad you guys enjoyed it.   I kinda suckered myself into getting some as well on Friday. Went with a friend after biking 10 miles.
memphis,359n5i,matuba,1 point,Mon May 11 07:17:09 2015 UTC,"I must be the only person who can't stand Sakura.  Always hear people raving about it, but I'm consistently disappointed and underwhelmed."
memphis,359n5i,fu_king,4,Fri May 8 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"This is second hand information, but supposedly the gas station on the corner of Poplar and Ridgeway has amazing sushi.  <searches google>  It's the BP station on the corner, Lee's Fresh Sushi and Deli"
memphis,359n5i,SurpriseButtStuff,3,Fri May 8 13:59:40 2015 UTC,Can verify. It's good.
memphis,359n5i,jakkaball,1 point,Fri May 8 14:50:23 2015 UTC,"Good sushi, not the best in Memphis but expectations have to be in line with gas station sushi. Made fresh there too, I've stopped in many times to see em at work."

memphis,359n5i,ltbs,3,Fri May 8 17:28:58 2015 UTC,Sakura is definitely awesome. Sekisui is always decent (all locations that I know of).
memphis,359n5i,SurpriseButtStuff,3,Fri May 8 12:59:25 2015 UTC,Me and my wife always eat at Sekisui Midtown. I would recommend the Maggatron and the Stone roll.
memphis,359n5i,jojotoughasnails,2,Fri May 8 14:57:26 2015 UTC,My boyfriend loves this place. They also have 2 for 1 sake!
memphis,359n5i,aca901,2,Fri May 8 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"Jacksonville roll all the way. So good! Also since it's a small place, it's a good idea to get on their site and make reservations."
memphis,359n5i,jakkaball,3,Fri May 8 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"A place I enjoy, but it's a small local place in Bartlett is OEC.  For your purpose though driving through town another option I'd suggest is Eat Well (Germantown Rd near cnr Stage). They have a buffet and consistently ok. A little pricey. Otherwise any of the many options will also get your sushi on. Good luck."
memphis,359n5i,keoni176,1 point,Fri May 8 16:14:25 2015 UTC,OEC is very tasty!
memphis,359n5i,primenumbersturnmeon,6,Fri May 8 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Best value for your money: Red Koi Memphis. Poplar and 240, near the Best Buy. Their rolls are absolutely huge, as big as their selection. You'll get 8-10 big pieces in each roll for the same price as a 6 piece roll somewhere like Sekisui, and they don't skimp on the fish. They have insane weekend lunch specials as well as hibachi if you're with someone who's not into sushi. The only downside other than the location is they tend to add a bit too much extra sauce to most of the rolls, but you can ask them to hold back. Their special is a $17 monstrosity called the Mummy Roll, and only pictures will do it justice.  Sekisui midtown has friendly staff and a convenient location, but the rolls are anemic and overpriced. If you go there, order the omakase. The other Sekisuis aren't much better.  Sakura is very good. Despite the traditional decor, they seem to specialize in fusion-style sushi. Portions are big and prices reasonable.  Ryu is pretty hit or miss. Very cheap, friendly service, but kinda dirty. The next door Asian supermarket is great though.  Bluefin: overpriced.  Osaka has lots of locations and a few of them have conveyor belts for lunch. Used to be a much better value before they doubled the belt prices.  Stix in Collierville is a hibachi place, but they have a bit of sushi. Prices are too high.  Hibachi Grill is an all-you-can-eat Chinese/Japanese buffet. Very low quality, but priced accordingly."
memphis,359n5i,Salviador,1 point,Fri May 8 15:57:53 2015 UTC,I'll second Red Koi. I used to get the lunch sushi special fairly often when I worked out near there. Great quality and good prices.
memphis,359n5i,Jefethevol,2,Sun May 10 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"I have heard Ryu on summer has good sushi but I have not been, personally.  I agree with the other guys about Sakura but sometimes I dont want to travel 25-30 minutes.  So I hit up Sekesui Pacific Rim on tuesdays for 2 for 1 rolls."
memphis,359n5i,AHappyMeal,5,Fri May 8 11:24:36 2015 UTC,Sakura is literally 2 blocks down the street.
memphis,359n5i,MizzippiRivah,2,Fri May 8 11:38:00 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned Fuji Cafe in Collierville. It's more Americanized than Sekisui, but IMO it is the best sushi in town. It's always fresh and delicious. While you're in that shopping center, check out the meat market a couple doors down. They have fantastic salmon there. They also carry Las Delicias guacamole."
memphis,359n5i,lolag0ddess,1 point,Sun May 10 13:42:19 2015 UTC,"Seconded! Fuji is one of my favorites. Complimentary miso soup, good roll prices, and the bento lunch specials are super tasty."
memphis,359n5i,souperslacker,1 point,Tue May 12 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience if you are into cooked/fried rolls then go to Sakura, if you are more into the uncooked variety I find that Osaka has a better selection. I've never gotten anything off of the belt though, I just order the rolls individually."

memphis,3577hi,Vinyl_Richie,2,Thu May 7 20:35:41 2015 UTC,What about the main library on poplar? Or maybe contact one of the local stations see what they do with their archives. I hope it helps some.
memphis,3577hi,Fugit43133,1 point,Thu May 7 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yea we've been in the Memphis room in the library, and that did yield a couple of clips, but there wasn't much beyond that. And most news stations don't keep extensive records from before the switch to digital. There's usually a third party that does this for them, and that's the type of entity i've been unable to locate. The one that actually mediates access to archival news footage."

Channel 5 just put up some info saying he was off the clock and waiting on a ride. So this guy works an honest job and falls asleep waiting for a ride because transit is so shitty here and presumably he doesn't feel safe walking or biking home. You publicly shame him for Internet points."

His shirt rose up over it. It has been a number of years now though.

memphis,354un9,Nerguls_Lady,5,Thu May 7 02:58:32 2015 UTC,I think they are lengthening the eastbound left turn lane into the park. That lane gets backed up and blocks the left lane on the weekends.

memphis,34xt5n,ShyAmhranai,2,Tue May 5 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"The company that purchased it mostly operates by modifying and renovating existing structures to build their hotels, so if they decided to go for demolition it must have been in pretty bad shape."

memphis,34xt5n,ShyAmhranai,2,Tue May 5 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"They have tried to renovate the existing building. My company has been working on the French Quarter since spring of last year. We completely replaced the entire TPO roof and skylights. There have been electricians and plumbers there for months trying to asses the damage. When we first started there, the hotel was trashed, had heavy water damage throughout, and was still filled with old and rotting furniture from years ago. It has since been gutted, dried, and inspected. You would not believe how much money the Chinese investors have already spent trying to reuse the existing structure."
memphis,34xt5n,keoni176,2,Wed May 6 12:10:46 2015 UTC,Surprises me they wanted to attempt a rehab. I don't think that building is all that old. Maybe early 1980s. It's new compared to most everything else over there.

I was trying to find one so we could eat around there, hang out, and have a short walk to a hotel and, surprisingly couldn't find anything. It was all either East Memphis/Ridgeway area, UofM, or downtown with some  shady ones thrown in around the medical district. Does that area need more residential? Even some of the houses almost directly on the square are in bad shape, I'd expect some flipping before new condo builds."

If you're only passing through overnight and want to have a fun experience, find a hotel downtown, the closer to Beale at 2nd Street the better. You'll have plenty of good restaurants and bars and live music within walking distance, and you won't have to worry about navigating. Downtown has a lot of one-way streets, our interstates are mired with construction, Riverside Drive is closed until the 25th for Memphis in May festivities, we really aren't a city to explore by car in the dark. Welcome and have some fun!"

We get it.  There is crime. You are upset about.  We got it.  I'm not trying to stifle you though, buddy.  You can rain on anybody's parade that you want to.

If someone can make a real case that we have such significantly higher crime than other places then I'm all ears. Everything I've ever heard consisted of emotional arguments from people that were upset about a few specific and high profile instances of crime.  This feeling is exacerbated by the complaints I hear from friends in other cities that crime is so high, yadda yadda yadda. It's the same song and the same dance.

memphis,34sfl1,IThinkErgoIAmAbe,3,Mon May 4 06:25:52 2015 UTC,That guy was pissing off everyone around him. I had to push him away several times. I loved the cheers when security pulled him out (both times).
memphis,34sfl1,Lancimus89,2,Mon May 4 13:51:53 2015 UTC,I wasn't there.  What happened?
memphis,34sfl1,notfuzzi,6,Mon May 4 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I wasn't there but I heard about Five Finger Death Punch embarrassing themselves. Apparently they were all drunk and the band broke up on stage, came back out after 20 minutes and then did it again. Here's the story: http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/five-finger-death-punchs-onstage-meltdown-fuels-rumors-of-internal-strife/"
memphis,34sfl1,IThinkErgoIAmAbe,2,Mon May 4 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this takes the cake for the most unique memory from this event. I wasn't there, but saw the highlights. When the singer was just walking around the stage, playing the drum set, and then walked into the crowd, I was like dude give it up already. Your band is fucking GONE, and what you're doing is super awkward."
memphis,34sfl1,igotpetdeers,2,Mon May 4 21:49:26 2015 UTC,I'm happy I saw lenny kravitz instead.
memphis,34sfl1,ShyAmhranai,4,Wed May 6 04:08:07 2015 UTC,The Avett Brothers were absolutely wonderful. They always have a great stage presence and an absolute blast with their music and it was wonderful to watch.  Ed Sheeran totally rocked all by himself.  I was also very pleasantly surprised by Hozier. Didn't know his other music besides that one church song that I can't stand. His voice is way better in person and the rest of his music is lovely. Also loved how he was drinking hot tea during the show. (Probably to help his throat but still!)  It was my first time going and I had so much fun. I look forward to next year!
memphis,34sfl1,st0rmbr1ng3r,3,Mon May 4 07:28:24 2015 UTC,"Hozier was pretty good.  I liked that he played ""One Thing"" by Beyoncé.  Sounded way better than I would have imagined."
memphis,34sfl1,IThinkErgoIAmAbe,3,Mon May 4 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"My highlights of the weekend were The Pixies and Flogging Molly.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of their sets.    However, Ed Sheeran really impressed me last night.  I had initially planned on leaving my wife to hear him and go listen to Wilco myself.  However, the sheer crowd for his show made me reluctant to leave her.  Regardless, a song or 2 into his set and I was there for the duration.  The fact that he was sampling/looping himself on the fly made for a really impressive set.  His music isn't maybe my first choice to listen to, but I can recognize and respect the technical ability of what he was doing.  That's one of the things I love about Music Fest, every year I go, I wind up hearing someone that I have never heard of, or have had no exposure to that I am then very glad to have heard.  AWOLNation was the same way, all I knew from them was ""Sail"" and they had a great set, too."
memphis,34sfl1,st0rmbr1ng3r,2,Mon May 4 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"Damn, missed FMolly. Did they bring the energy? Was the crowd into it?  Yeah, one of my co-workers said she cried after one of Mr.Sheeran's songs. Either she's a wimp, or he's that good."
memphis,34sfl1,igotpetdeers,1 point,Mon May 4 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"It was my first time seeing FMolly, but they had a lot of energy. It was earlier in the afternoon, so the crowd was a little small. However, the ones that were there were really into it."
memphis,34sfl1,cptAckAck,3,Tue May 5 01:10:10 2015 UTC,"Favorites were lenny kravitz, slash, geazy, and wale. Lenny was amazing because he's a legend and wale had us turnt as fuck.  Favorite time was when a dude threw a bottle, hit a girl, girls bf ran through the crowd like a bull and beat his ass.  Also when paramore brought a girl(holly) on stage to sing. that shit was amazing."

Or up along the bluffs where you could lay a blanket or snag one of the benches along the way (great views, lots of magnolia trees, etc). Madison hotel rooftop (or Peabody hotel) at sunset. Or walk along the bluffs through the South Bluffs neighborhood - tons of flowers and trees, gazebos and fountains. It will look familiar to a New Orleanian. Shout with questions and I'll do my best to help. Good luck!"

Heres one that works though. http://www.mrexpedition.squarespace.com/  Memphis is pretty friendly to people traveling through via river.  I need to warn you though, there was a news story last year or a few years ago about a man who had his entire kayak stolen with all of his belongings in it while passing through.  So I would say try to be smart about where you leave your stuff if you decide to go explore for awhile.    Right on the riverbank underneath the bridge crossing into memphis you will find the Beale Street Landing.  Its nothing to waste time on as a tourist attraction but that and the bridge will let you know you are in memphis along with some paddle boats tied up.    There are parks, BBQ, and beer all within walking distance of the shore as well. You should have no problem accomplishing your goals.

memphis,34jqee,keeplynehamweird,2,Fri May 1 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"I rode down yesterday from Midtown. Traffic is ridiculous on a bike and everyone appeared to be drunk, so be careful, but Cooper Young area is best to park and ride. Go West on Young to McClean. North on McClean to Madison and West Madison to downtown. It's all bike lanes until you get to Cleveland but I used to ride this route for work and it's safe. You can also camp Shelby Forest. It's about 25 minutes from downtown."
memphis,34jqee,blood_stache,2,Sun May 3 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"I vote Cooper-Young. Imagine Vegan is there and most of the restaurants will have veg options. Park on one of the side streets or on Cooper if you can find a spot. It's not resident restricted so as long as you're not too close to a stop sign, it's okay. To bike down, take Cooper to either Harbert (residential) or Peabody (busier and wider). Then take MLK downtown. Google Map says it's highway 78 but it's very very wide but only one lane each way. I use it to get downtown and it's fine to bike on. Also here's a map of bike facilities but it has bike racks on there as well."

memphis,34jqee,SurpriseButtStuff,0,Fri May 1 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I quite understand, but I'll do my best to help out here...  Cooper-Young is probably the closest ""cool/unique neighborhood"" that would also be vegetarian friendly, but at 5.6 miles, it will be a bit of a ride.  What I would recommend is just parking in a parking garage, and then biking around downtown. I'm not sure you save as much money that way, but personally I would feel uncomfortable leaving my car in a neighborhood, not from a crime standpoint, but rather from possibly parking somewhere that might get me towed.  If you're open to parking downtown, you might consider parking at either the North End Terminal lot or the parking lot on Shadyac Ave at Main St. From either of you those, you could bike around the Pinch district or head down Main Street to go to BSMF. There's also some great food off of Main Street. Specifically, once you pass over Madison St headed south there is:   Eighty3 Felicia Suzanne's McEwens Bardog Flight Rendezvous Huey's Aldo's  Flying Fish Tamp & Tap Bluefin The Majestic Grille Flying Saucer   Hope this helps!"

memphis,34bncy,supposedtobeworkin,2,Fri May 1 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"Let's review this shit.  How does a city reuse a former basketball arena when the team moves to new digs across town?   It was a rough place - the seediest dive on the wharf. Populated with every reject and cutthroat from Bombay to Calcutta. It's worse than Detroit.  And what if, hypothetically, that arena is shaped like a pyramid? This? Why, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pterodactyl..  If you’re Memphis, you fill it with a 535,000 square-foot Bass Pro Shop, then sit back and wait for the apocalypse to arrive. Bad news. The fog's getting thicker. Built in 1991, Memphis’s Great American Pyramid has been empty for over a decade, looming on the skyline like a bad idea conceived after too much cocaine. Numerous proposals have tried to revive the 32-story pyramid but none had the $191 million backing of America’s most audacious retailer. And Leon is getting laaaaarrrrrger.  In addition to the sales floor, the store is like a Vegas-scale Bubba Gump outpost including a cypress swamp with live alligators, a bowling alley, a restaurant, an observation deck, taxidermy museum, and a hotel. If these photos aren’t enough to convince you of humanity’s impending doom, there are more images over at Bloomberg Businessweek. The store opened today.  There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?"
memphis,34bncy,wdb2n,1 point,Fri May 1 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"This was a satirical piece; calm down, memphians. As a transplant, I can tell you that while I love memphis, the pyramid is odd and hard for people with no emotional attachment to it to understand. Yes, it being a Bass Pro is better than it being vacant, obviously, but there is something a little off about having a giant pyramid arena in your skyline that is mega Bass Pro.  Again, it's better occupied than empty, but most people outside of Memphis aren't aware of the pyramid to begin with, whereas many natives feel like it's a much more important part of Memphis's identity. The Arch put STL on the map and is the one thing people universally can associate with STL. The Golden Gate Bridge for SF. The Sears Tower for Chi. Etc. Etc. The pyramid wasn't / isn't that for Memphis, but that doesn't make it any less relevant as a city. Don't take any of this as a personal attack, Memphis."

It's a first world problem, but it's incredibly obnoxious. The owners have actually called MATA themselves about it.  I can't complain too much since I can just stick headphones in until it's time to go home, but I'd be mad if I had to live with it.  Someone filmed one of the buses and it's true; the bell goes off every 30 seconds or so, though the buses aren't always close enough to hear it."
memphis,34c8xa,tacojohn48,2,Thu Apr 30 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. I timed it, and asked a trolley bus driver as well.  The bus ""brains"" are programmed to make the bell sound every 45 seconds automatically - the bus driver has no control over it whatsoever. And it's not just 1 ""ding"", it's a series of 5 or 6 dings; wait 2 seconds, then 5 or 6 more dings. It's a fact, not an exaggeration.   And yes, the buses do move, but they also park and wait on a schedule. So for example, the Madison trolley parks at Main & Madison for around five minutes on every round-trip. So for 5 mins at a time, every 15 mins or so; they are constantly ringing.  And one more point to your ever so sympathetic question....the buses on Main go both directions and at a more frequent schedule, so at many multiple times during a 10 hour bus schedule day; at the Main/Madison intersection; you have 3 buses with bells going off at different times. I personally counted 60 ""dings"" in 3 minutes.  Fact!"

memphis,34bkb8,workerturker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:27:20 2015 UTC,We've had 30 Mbps AT&T Uverse for the past five years and really haven't had any issues at all. It's been extremely reliable for us.

memphis,34bkb8,topherlooks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:05:40 2015 UTC,"Both companies suck. But AT&T definitely sucks less. I decided on U-verse after my neighbors all badmouthed Comcast in our neighborhood. My parents in Germantown went with Comcast, and they're always having outages. Before U-verse, I had regular DSL, which was OK, had occasional outages but was still more reliable than any cable service I've ever had. Then I got U-verse, TV and internet. Two technicians spent the better part of a day getting the house wiring up to snuff, and two different techs came to get the incoming copper up to the signal levels needed to achieve the speed tier I was sold. It has been 4-4.5 years and the only outage I've experienced was a national outage. I have always gotten the speed I was promised, sometimes I actually get a few Mbps more. My only complaint is they haven't rolled out faster tiers or rolled out fiber to the home like they were rumored to do.  I recently ordered a wireless TV receiver online through ATT. Someone forgot to throw in a component in the box, so I called in. They rolled a truck, no extra charge, and the technician brought the missing piece and set it up (not that it's difficult), and while there also checked signal levels for our connection to make sure they were OK, said it's SOP for U-verse tech visits. They seem to go out of their way to make sure the service is going to work, unlike their regular DSL offering, or Comcast.  If you want faster speeds, you can definitely get Comcast business, which I believe has an SLA, and you may have a better experience than regular consumer Comcast."

Their consumer plans are data capped @ 300gb/month with another 50gb for $10 automatically charges to your account. I'm primarily a Netflix/Hulu watcher and have only gone over once or twice last year.  AT&T uverse works well if you can get it, I've heard lots of people have been told they could get it but ended up being ""too far"" and getting stuck with DSL. AT&T is not offering fiber to home only to the nose as far as I know."
memphis,34bkb8,MojoMercury,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:54:18 2015 UTC,I had comcast for 2 years when I was still in town.  I rarely had any downtime at all with my 25mbps service.  It is expensive though. About $70 a month for just internet alone at that speed.

I live at the Edison at Danny Thomas and Jefferson, and though it's also run down, bug filled, and sometimes scary, it's pretty cheap for downtown($575/m for small-ass 1 bedroom)  Of course, for the same price, you can get something much nicer elsewhere. I don't think living downtown is really worth it unless you can afford something somewhat nice like the Number 10 apartments."

Side note it was the first sky scrapper south of Chicago when it was built back in the day. There are also apartments above the downtown deli on main and union. There Are actually quite a few newer apartments between Union and Beale on Main. As well as the old lowenstien building and the Mid America tower next to it on Jefferson and Main. However stay away from 99 tower, mainly section 8 housing."

They are often on a waitlist unless you want a ground floor apartment. Considering the highway is on one side and hospitals on the other, that could be a bit noisy.  Also, Bristol is at 240 and Union so it's not quite downtown."

Not sure how I'd feel about meeting up with a redditor. In theory it would be pretty cool, but I'd like to go with someone who was in my age group and what not.

Last year my favorite band, third eye blind, came to BSMF. I knew this might be the only chance I would get to see them live. I rode with a few friends but they decided to see juicy j or some other rapper and basically left me alone. I was nervous but it turned out to be one of the best experiences ever.

They've come to the end of spending as they wish and levying new fees and taxes on the remaining tax base without serious backlash. Some of the same people who have nothing nice to say about Bass pro are also speaking up wanting more police coverage, more programs for youth, more poverty based programs, etc.   I'm not sure the relationship between the two is evident to them. I'm also not sure they realize Memphis is a speck of urban America surrounded by a sea of rural country folk that hunt and fish and go into the real woods. These rural folk will be propping up the city with their sales taxes on their outdoors purchases. They already flood the existing store off Sycamore View from miles around. They'll do the same with this store. Just like urbanites eat up IKEA and drive hours to those stores. And we are getting one of those as well in a couple years. This has the potential to be a huge boost to our local economy at a time when we desperately need it. Let's just hope for some fiscal responsibility in our local government when those dollars roll in and they don't go hood rich and blow it all on dumb shit for votes."

memphis,3428w0,Penguin_Eggs,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:55:46 2015 UTC,Not many places are showing it because of how much it costs the restaurant. We were quoted $3000 for our restaurant that seats about 100. And it's just not worth the risk to a lot of places because of the possible deficit. The only places I've heard that are carrying it are fox and hound and Rec Room on Broad.

Never had anything bad happen to me apart from someone going through the garbage in my car when I left it unlocked. However, the neighborhood can turn from good to bad in just a few streets and it's almost impossible to tell without an informed opinion.   My personal advice is to move downtown/Mud island first for 6 months or so until you get a feel for where you'd want to live in midtown. Pretty much everywhere in those two places is a safe bet. Alternatively, ask someone who know's the area."

The jail is right across the block which isn't fun.  The apartment they showed us at first was very nice but it wasn't the one they gave us. The walk through before we moved in was horrible . There was a giant list of problems. A full 8.5""x11"" sheet with two columns filled with problems that maybe a third got resolved. The air conditioner unit broke down every 3 months and the wood under our sink was blackened with mold and still water when we moved in.  Aka no to uptown square.

memphis,33wid8,UofM901,13,Sun Apr 26 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"As a hiring manager who has struggled to find qualified people for well-paying office jobs, I can give you some direction on applying for jobs in today's market.  First of all, make sure your resume is perfect and spend time translating your skillset to non-military terms so that the average layperson can understand what you can do. Then connect how those skills will benefit the employer in the specific job for which you are applying.   I can't stress enough the importance of a perfect resume. Out of 150 resumes I review, only 10% actually measure up to the the applicants' claims that they have excellent written communication skills. I can't consider applicants that lie on their resumes or who are unaware of such a major deficiency. If they aren't great writers, fine, but they should get someone to look over their resumes or google grammar rules until they get it right.  Aside from that, any online application will be compared to the job description using software and you increase your chances of being a match by using the same key words in your resume that are used in the job description. Don't just list them at the top....take the time to incorporate them into the resume (added bonus is that it further proves those excellent written communication skills).  Finally, write a cover letter and explain your transition, career goals,etc. You must be disciplined and capable of following direction, for example, so explain why that will benefit the employer in that particular role.   I promise, this will make all the difference in your journey to finding a new career. In the corporate world, it is more important to find candidates who are trainable than to find candidates who have a lot of experience in a particular job. A self-aware, dedicated employee who can accept coaching and constructive criticism is what most hiring managers need, and we are willing to invest in people who can show on the front end that they will be an asset rather than a liability."

memphis,33uv1z,rbenayad,4,Sat Apr 25 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"Bike friendly?  Sorta.  It really depends on where you live but the city has made big strides in adding bike lanes in the past years.  You will need a vehicle to really get around though.   Dangerous?  Yes.  Memphis has a crime problem.  It is concentrated in certain areas but crime can be found throughout the city.  That being said, if you just use common sense like stowing valuables out of sight in your car, dont walk alone in sketch areas late at night, etc... you will probably be fine.  Most of the city is perfectly fine but crime does seem to pop up all periodically all around town.   Bang for the buck?  Most of the city.  Memphis has one of the lowest costs of living in the nation.  It all depends on where you want to live.  You can find places from $600-$1600 a month here.    Be prepared for the heat.  It seriously sucks.  Summers will regularly see weeks of 90+ degree temperatures and humidity of %80+.   Get used to being sweaty.  Its just part of it."
memphis,33uv1z,CaptainInsane-o,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:36:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for all this info. I really appreciate it! I decided to be in the Germantown/Cordova area. Any thoughts on a car/bike?
memphis,33uv1z,panken,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:32:59 2015 UTC,Car is a definite for those areas.  Midtown/East Memphis are the bike parts of town.
memphis,33uv1z,BakedBrunch,2,Tue Apr 28 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"Bike lanes are currently being added, but having a car is still necessary. It's not as dangerous as people say, some neighborhoods are good, some bad, but the weird thing is that they are very close, so one block will have mansions, and two blocks later you have very poor areas. If you find yourself in a bad neighborhood just keep going and you'll soon be in a better part of town. Rent an apartment (a flat) in Midtown. Very cheap and nice living, very cool part of town with lots of art and diversity."
memphis,33uv1z,tracyyyyyyyyyy,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:48:10 2015 UTC,Maybe in Central Gardens and Cooper Young. But overall it's got way more diversity than most other areas of the city. Most of memphis is sectioned off between black and white. Check out the apartment communities on Belvedere (literally right in the middle of midtown) or Vollintine/Evergreen and tell me it's not diverse.
memphis,33uv1z,tracyyyyyyyyyy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:34:47 2015 UTC,"Was referring more to the part as you approach Watkins.

memphis,33uv1z,keithmont,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"Memphis is getting more and more bike friendly. We have a lot of bike lanes, especially within midtown, but if you need to get from one side of town to another, you'll want a car.  It's not as dangerous as everyone makes it out to be. Period. If you're looking to rent, look around midtown or university district. There's quite a bit of affordable housing.  Advice: get involved. It's easy to get plugged in if you're willing to put yourself out there. It's a pretty connected city, and the summer has tons of great events and stuff going on.

memphis,33sjff,Bored_gamer1,3,Sat Apr 25 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"No, the locals call it ""MudFest"" and it's sometimes not just ""a little rain."" They've evacuated the whole festival for tornado warnings in the past. Buy some cheap rain boots at Walmart or Payless and use them. I would also recommend having some cheap ponchos with you. Or, if you're too cheap to get ponchos (not an insult) bring two trash bags you can put on in a snap as makeshift ponchos. It really can get wet down there. But last year they had pretty good weather if I remember correctly. One of the first years in a long while it didn't rain.  Have fun though! And if you need a place to dry off for a bit after the festival, Beale street is packed with places to go and hang out also!"
memphis,33sjff,jojotoughasnails,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:20:28 2015 UTC,Wow.  I think we actually have a couple ponchos so I'll make sure to pack those.

memphis,33sjff,louiscon,2,Sat Apr 25 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I checked the weather after I posted that and it looks (right now) like there's only a slim chance of rain for the weekend, but keep an eye on it and have fun! You'll definitely have more fun if you're prepared for the worst and it doesn't happen than the bottom falling out and not being ready, hah.   Make sure you also have a jacket, as it can be a bit chilly and windy down by the river also. Unless you're planning on using the wall of folks there as heat and wind protection as well. (Somehow I turned into a protective mother hen typing this out...)  Also, if you're fans of dive bars, I always recommend P&H cafe. It's a nice spot open until 3am, on Madison Ave. You'll have to take a cab to get there from downtown, as it's a bit of a walk through not the best area, but the cab fare shouldn't be more than 10-15 bucks from downtown. (Not sure where you're staying.)"
memphis,33sjff,Blakemus22,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:09:54 2015 UTC,I was going to try to use uber while we are down there but we are staying in west memphis so like 7 or 8 miles from downtown.

memphis,33sjff,fingawkward,3,Sat Apr 25 16:55:35 2015 UTC,Since you'll be downtown just head over to Mud Island. The parks really  nice and it's good for walking/biking. Plus it's a nice sunset.
memphis,33sjff,Andranoria,2,Sat Apr 25 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"on saturday's the dixon gallery is free from 10 - noon. it's a really nice, smallish art gallery on the east part of town. it also has a beautiful garden and is across the street from the botanic garden.   just up the road is the best breakfast in town, brother junipers. get there early or you'll have a wait, but the pancakes and cheese grits are phenomenal.   if you head a little further east you can see one of our craziest attractions. not exactly romantic, but there's the ""statue of liberation through christ,"" which is the statue of liberty holding a cross and the ten commandments. it's worth the drive to see something that...unique."

memphis,33q655,IIsForInglip,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:24:25 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to try that place out. Their website left a lot to be desired. What are their prices like?
memphis,33q655,IIsForInglip,3,Fri Apr 24 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"The living room rentals are $10/hr Monday through Thursday and $25/hour on weekends, I think. There's no cover charge before 9PM. The arcade games are free to play. Some of them have issues (Donkey Kong, for example, tends to have a stuck start button, which means the game starts over immediately as long as there are credits.) They are working on getting more arcade machines working and trying to get the ones they have out back up to spec. They have foosball, ping pong, and shuffleboard tables too, if that's your thing. They serve local and regional beers mostly, and have non-alcoholic beverages like Cokes, but the only time they have any food is when the food trucks are there. I do enjoy the atmosphere of the place, and I enjoy playing the arcade machines, even though there isn't a huge selection yet. I haven't rented a living room setup yet, but they have all kinds of consoles from Atari to the latest.  tl;dr -- I'd say give it a shot, I kinda felt almost like I was in Flynn's Arcade the first time I went. (They do have a TRON arcade machine, even.)"

memphis,33l3eq,mjxa1,16,Thu Apr 23 12:02:29 2015 UTC,"Why do you think rising crime rates among teens are inextricably tied to ""behavior of police officers?"" It's an interesting idea, but if examined scientifically, I doubt one for which you would find much correlation or support.  Additionally, why are you convinced there is a ""rising crime rate amongst teenagers in Memphis?""  There have certainly been well-publicized incidents of teen crime recently.  But a few incidents don't equate to a rise in teen crime in the city as a whole.  What data do you have which indicates there is a rise in teen crime?  What data do you have which demonstrates that police officer behavior has caused the rise in crime, assuming you can prove that it exists?"
memphis,33l3eq,masterofmustaches,8,Thu Apr 23 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"Dude cant see the forest for the trees.  Violent Crime rate can go down significantly, and these flash mob assaults could go up, but that doesnt change the overarching trend.  I personally dont think this will end until a teen ends up getting shot in self defense.   MPD (and most other police departments) have no real way to stop this, short of having fast response show up and wait around as a show of force if a group of more then 5 teens shows up in the same area (which is impractical and expensive)."
memphis,33l3eq,gravshift,10,Thu Apr 23 12:36:56 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU! This isn't my topic by choice, there was kind of a voting situation in my class and this one won. I didn't really agree with the police part either and made your exact argument in class. That's actually the reason for this post - i thought i was missing something.  As for the teen crimerate thing, i probably should have explained it better; crime isn't necessarily the right word. We're discussing juvenile behavior in general: smoking, vandalism, truancy, etc. And the thing that we all agreed on (my class) is that this occurs because i f a lack of things for teens to do in Memphis and lack of proper authority. I wanted to lean more towards the former, but like i said, tying it all together is part of the assignment."
memphis,33l3eq,Wobblie,3,Thu Apr 23 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"I would strongly suggest doing a bit of research - not much, just look at enough to get a couple of papers to reference.  Some questions you should think about/answer: What crimes are people being arrested for? Is there a disparity in the races/ethnicities of the people being arrested? Can this be explained better in terms of socio-economic situations instead of direct acts of discrimination by the police (articles on institutional racism versus individual discrimination would be helpful here, although there's ambiguity regarding whether or not the actions of particular officers are indicative of institutional racism or their individual beliefs.)?  Most people who advocate for police reform take a fairly conservative route - they claim that the reason for police abuses are because there's no community connection between the police and the people. This kind of begs the question of whether or not there was ever a time where community relations with the police were good for everyone, but there are plenty of articles out there on it. Your research really shouldn't take more than a half hour if you know your google-fu.  It's totally legitimate to take the opposite position than what the prompt seems to want you to take, at least as it's put here. But the best way to write a good paper about something like that isn't to just say ""this is what I think."" You should explain what arguments COULD be made in favor of the claim that police discrimination is the cause of rising arrest rates (or whatever arguments come out as legitimate concerns, here). Then, you should use those arguments as a foil, a means to explain your own position. You should show why their wrong, and why the fact that they're incorrect about the facts of the matter means that your view is a better one. Explaining every argument in the best way possible, whether you agree with it or not, and then making direct and logical connections between the failures of those arguments and your own position will guarantee an A.  I'm not sure if you've used it before, but google scholar is essential for starting research, and you can put in the settings that you're associated with a certain college, so you can access articles that you would normally have to go through the library's site for. Definitely poke around a little. And if you need PDFs of books that look helpful or interesting... PM me."
memphis,33l3eq,KnifehandHolsters,3,Thu Apr 23 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"The rallying cries from the communities from which criminal youth hail is often more money for more programs for youth.  Why is it not an examination of the failures of the parents to actually parent their children? All the money and programs in the world will not change a person who doesn't want to change. Boredom has less to do with it than nonexistent parenting. Lots of kids are bored, but most of them don't beat people unprovoked and stomp random cars and vandalize...where then does the difference lie?The kids are feral and unsocialized as a result of failure in the home and their immediate community. That's the elephant in the room. No one in power wants to be  the one to take the mic and tell these people that they have failed as parents and their failure has caused this mess. It is much more politically safe to propose to throw money at them and their kids instead.   How can police be anything but reactive, when proactive policing is often dismissed as profiling or harassment? What exactly do the people proposing that police ""do more"" expect police to do? Stop and frisk? Break up loitering people on private property?  If this paper is due to be followed with a debate and discussion, these are a couple questions I'd ask of them."

memphis,33l3eq,caramelbologna,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the problem of determining proper parenting is who dictates the standard of what's proper?   Edit: Much less the ages of the kids involved have spent more time in school or daycare than at home with parents. Combine that with the fact that the kids are teens and thus historically rebellious. I think the real question is freedom vs safety and the other part as to why would be insecurities. When you feel powerless it's common to find others that feel the same. As a group you become empowered and if those insecurities are still not resolved healthily you lash out. But then you need to ask where the insecurities come from and is it self created or imposed by outside forces? IE young minorities who may feel they don't have the opportunities as others feel powerless and lash out. The system steps in and sends them to alternative school. Only reinforcing the powerlessness however the system has its own insecurities of things not working in spec and so it had to lash out of the teens. Teens find other teens with same views and are now a larger more powerful entity. However since the system connected like mind individuals together, the insecurities fester and the group lashes out and this time they have more power and influence due to the level that things can escalate. However now the larger entity creates insecurities for the society they live in and they also will lash out. So it's really just a matter of everyone calming their happy ass down and treating everyone else as they want to be treated but until then keep and eye out of emotionally excited groups swarming and unless you can back up your request for a massive group of kids to leave the store, don't."

Its a fact that has to be faced if the community is going to recognize the issue and change anything but Im not going to wait on it.  It will come as fast as Obamas ""change"".  Please look at the data below if you question the legitimacy of where this problem lies.  The hispanic community faces poverty, poor education, and lifes troubles as well but I havent seen gangs of them smashing in cars or people in memphis.  http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/sites/all/files/databooks/05_FamilyHomeEnvironment_TUCI2006.pdf  http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/sites/all/files/databooks/TUCI_Data_Book_VII_2012.03_demographics.pdf  Here are some key points from those PDFs from the Urban Child Institute.     In Memphis, 85 percent of children in poverty live in unmarried-parent families. Similarly, in suburban Shelby County, 69 percent of poor children live in unmarried-parent families. 60 percent of Memphis children live with an unmarried parent. 22 percent of children in suburban Shelby County live with an unmarried parent. In Memphis, 85 percent of children in poverty live in unmarried-parent families. Similarly, in suburban Shelby County, 69 percent of poor children live in unmarried-parent families. In Memphis 64 percent of children were born to unmarried mothers. This is much higher than the national average. One in four children was born to a mother who had less than 12 years of education. Fifteen percent of children in Memphis live with grandparents or other relatives. Two in three black children live with single mothers. Black children are twice as likely to live with a single mother as with married parents."
memphis,33l3eq,jojotoughasnails,6,Thu Apr 23 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if crime rates are rising or if this stuff is just hot in the news and getting reported. I can tell you some of the things that I have heard from friends and family in the local justice system.  The city crackdown on the police budget has had a huge impact on the police force and their ability to do their job. The benefit cuts have forced most of the officers to consider whether working for MPD is the best career move they can make. A lot of the officers who were good enough to get jobs in other departments have left. There have been some officers who left police work altogether. From what I hear, the officers who have left have not been replaced. Even if the numbers were replaced, they would be filled with a new academy class and the quality of the force would still be lower as a result of losing some of its most qualified police.   The biggest impact of all of this that you can see for yourself everyday is that most patrol cars are now manned by one officer. Without backup most officers aren't willing to take the risks required to make arrests. Response times will slow down as the first car arriving will need to wait for back up before addressing a violent situation. Also higher risk traffic stops will be avoided because the officer is alone in the cruiser.   You also have to consider the human effect of what amounts to a reduction in pay. You inevitably feel less valued by your employer. If a big part of your job is to risk your life and well being, and you suddenly feel less valued how would you respond? You also have to consider political motives. If they take money from the police force the fastest way to get it back is to let crime go back up. Eventually the people will get sick of it and pressure the politicians to fully fund the police department.   tldr: The police aint doing shit til they get their money back."

It's anecdotal, but I recycle at least double what I used to. The bin would fill up in a couple of days and the rest of the week's recyclables would go into the trash cart. Now I have plenty of room for the recyclables. Rolling that joker out to the curb like the trash cart beats carrying a heavy bin, and the roller cart doesn't get full of water and bugs like the bin did, either. Get a new can, when you can!"

Not entirely sure where they are getting their data, but it mostly looks like ppl driving as it goes along the roads and doesnt seem to offer any coverage information for anything that isnt along a road. Oh, and it shows that Sprint has the best 4g coverage in Memphis, so, I am a bit skeptical!  However, from the responses here it seems that the general consensus is that is it better than what I am using now, so I might make the jump once they have another deal."

memphis,33i1pq,matuba,3,Wed Apr 22 19:48:13 2015 UTC,I think this has to do with the frequency T-Mobile operates on. I called about it before and they said they were actively licensing new spectrum to get better indoor coverage.

LTE is often faster than my comcast cable internet.   Outside of town coverage is iffy. You can usually make a call or get some really slow data if you drive around a bit.

memphis,33iepx,CaptainInsane-o,2,Wed Apr 22 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"They were contracted to move belongings from one house to another and essentially quit after the first day and never returned.  So day 1 of the move they all show up, wrap up furniture in plastic and start moving things.  About 60% of the stuff gets moved that day and then day 2 just nobody showed up.  They said they had fulfilled their end of the agreement which was I guess their service for one day.  Its a shitty way to do business when you are hired to do a move which means from start to finish no matter how many days it takes.  They left furniture they wrapped in plastic and prepped to move in the original house simply because they didnt get to it ""in time"".  On the second day when we made contact with them they refused to send out any help or a moving truck after we had paid a couple thousand bucks.  They only started to budge after we got banks, credit card companies, and showed our willingness to go to small claims.  We literally ended up renting a uhaul truck and finishing the move ourselves.  It was pretty miserable overall and it took quite a bit for me not to open up a can on them as captain insaneo likes to do."

They will do the packing for you. The first thing the movers said when they got to my apt was ""UGH! How much do we have to pack?"" I had 95% of my 1 bdr apt packed up already. All these guys had to do was pack the kitchen (they took 4 hours, charging me by the hour). They convinced me that wrapping my tv stand wasn't necessary, and would cost me a lot more so like an idiot I agreed, and they scratched the hell out of the wood and knocked one of the side doors all caddywompus. I will NEVER use them again.   Edit- Also they mentioned, no less than 10 times during the entire day, to go give them good reviews online. I don't know why that stuck with me."

WSHS regularly places in the top number of National Merit Finalists in the whole state but it also regularly gets media attention every-time some delinquency like this is caught on camera. There are classes at WSHS teaching University level Physics (w/ calculus) and there are also classes like ""personal finance"" where the teacher himself has filed for bankruptcy 4+ times.   The parents who have time and money to care for their kids really help make the school one of the ""better"" public schools in the region, and this level of success being so uncommon in Memphis public schools makes other entities look at WSHS with a microscope, hoping to discredit anything positive about the school with this kind of juvenile behavior [seriously, how does a parent paying $30k/yr for their child to go to a private school respond to seeing WSHS dominating that private school in the Knowledge Bowl/Quiz Bowl tournaments?].    Though WSHS is not blame free - I definitely noticed among faculty that there's a perceived notion between the Standard and Optional programs, where goals are meant to ""nurture"" the Optional students but only ""manage"" the Standard students. Nevertheless any school with 2000+ students is going to have problems, outliers, and bad apples, but for a public school WSHS does it better than any other in Memphis."

memphis,33e81d,MemphisPossss,6,Wed Apr 22 12:58:46 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a symptom of poverty and shitty role models.  Black kids don't have a monopoly on violence, fighting, gangs or stupid shenanigans.  Yet we have seen a lot of trouble and violence involving black kids in Memphis.  I know this is a contentious subject, and prone to loud cries of racism from all sides.  I believe that there are large segments of our community, and more specifically, large segments of the black community that struggle with poverty, crappy education, negative social expectations, and horrible role models, and a dose of poor or nonexistent parenting.  There is a sizable segment of rap music that glorifies gangsterism, drugs, criminality, sexism and violence.  I think that this contributes to the problem.  I think it's a complicated issue.  The black community has some issues that I think need to be sorted out, but I also believe that african-american folks oftentimes do not get a fair shake in our society, and I believe that contributes to the problem, and sometimes to the anger in the black community.  Gonna hit save, against my better judgement.  This is just my two cents.  I'm not looking for a debate or argument, we all have opinions on the matter."
memphis,33e81d,fu_king,7,Wed Apr 22 13:01:21 2015 UTC,"Its a very complicated issue but we shouldn't avoid the truth that this problem of mob attacks and kids acting out in mass numbers with beatings and vandalism has been primarily found in the black community in memphis.  Its a fact that has to be faced if the community is going to recognize the issue and change anything but Im not going to wait on it.  It will come as fast as Obamas ""change"".  Please look at the data below if you question the legitimacy of where this problem lies.  The hispanic community faces poverty, poor education, and lifes troubles as well but I havent seen gangs of them smashing in cars or people in memphis.  http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/sites/all/files/databooks/05_FamilyHomeEnvironment_TUCI2006.pdf  http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/sites/all/files/databooks/TUCI_Data_Book_VII_2012.03_demographics.pdf  Here are some key points from those PDFs from the Urban Child Institute.     In Memphis, 85 percent of children in poverty live in unmarried-parent families. Similarly, in suburban Shelby County, 69 percent of poor children live in unmarried-parent families. 60 percent of Memphis children live with an unmarried parent. 22 percent of children in suburban Shelby County live with an unmarried parent. In Memphis, 85 percent of children in poverty live in unmarried-parent families. Similarly, in suburban Shelby County, 69 percent of poor children live in unmarried-parent families. In Memphis 64 percent of children were born to unmarried mothers. This is much higher than the national average. One in four children was born to a mother who had less than 12 years of education. Fifteen percent of children in Memphis live with grandparents or other relatives. Two in three black children live with single mothers. Black children are twice as likely to live with a single mother as with married parents."

Edit: Ok this is starting to make better sense.. Sounds like they might have been looking for body parts all the way around the interstate system. Jesus.
memphis,33dhcx,Awwfull,2,Tue Apr 21 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Well the guys legs were torn from his body. They couldn't find them and I think they thought maybe a semi had dragged them down the road.   It was not a pretty sight. The motorcyclists were going over 100 MPH

memphis,33bwqi,Maleus21,2,Tue Apr 21 07:09:13 2015 UTC,"Thinking about joining myself. I just moved here late last year. Very interested in shooting (especially rifles), but have only had the opportunity to shoot over 100 one time as a guest at a range in Florida. And that was only 200 yds.   I even proposed to my wife with a built AR with ""Will you marry me"" engraved on the lower. I've been increasingly obsessed with firearms for the past 8 years and haven't justified my obsession with enough range time yet. I've been in this rigorous training since August and the next month decides whether those in my class with me keep our jobs or not, so I'll be waiting until after that to go through with joining.   To happy: I did get a chance to shoot a full auto tommy gun in Vegas. That is my dream weapon. But I will be setting up a trust soon to start getting suppressors and such. And iiiiiii can't wait to get that ball rolling."
memphis,33bwqi,gdkirk,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:23:29 2015 UTC,Considering it. Just started my collection and this is seriously the only rifle range in memphis

memphis,33bwqi,juddvong,2,Thu May 7 09:00:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't forgot about ya :)  Im still getting settled in, and don't even have an a member card yet.  So far Im loving it, been basically every weekend that I can. And just shooting at the rifle station, my poor pistols haven't seen any love in weeks hehe.   I am learning real fast that I thought I was a good shot and I am absolutely not a good shot haha. My goal is quickly becoming to tighten up my groups with my AR to learn to shoot accurately, then I will probably begin to rebuild it for longer range."
memphis,33bwqi,CaptainInsane-o,1 point,Thu May 7 15:47:25 2015 UTC,Too pricey for me. It really takes some commitment to get your moneys worth. You really don't have too many options though. I'll just stick to the matches there.
memphis,33bwqi,AHappyMeal,3,Tue Apr 21 12:11:28 2015 UTC,Too pricey for me.    x2.  Its outrageous expensive for what it is.
memphis,33bwqi,AHappyMeal,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"Its the initiation fee that makes it hard to swallow. Took me forever to accept that. Once that part is over, its actually cheaper than going to someplace like Range USA. Especially if you like to shoot rifles.  I love shooting rifles, and I wanted to shoot long range. This was my only option, but after going there and seeing the facility, it wasn't bad.  I definitely wouldn't join if I just shot pistols, but if you enjoy shooting rifles at all, you should reconsider it."
memphis,33bwqi,panken,2,Tue Apr 21 13:36:38 2015 UTC,Initiation fee keeps out the riff-raff. Just saying. And people still get shot on this range due to negligence. Food for thought.   People serious about shooting will pay it. Someone who thinks it'd be nice to take their date to range on a Saturday night won't.
memphis,33bwqi,panken,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"Hopefully its better than AR night at Range USA. Ive actually left from there early because of some of the people up there. Shooting ""gangster style"" where the gun was recoiling toward the station beside them, sweeping me with their gun as they were talking to friends, just annoying stuff.   I go to the range safety meeting tonight, and hopefully Ill be up there this weekend doing some shooting to check it out."
memphis,33bwqi,AHappyMeal,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:34:11 2015 UTC,You won't be seeing any gangster style shooting at this range. Most of it is people shooting themselves due to complacency. There were a few freaky ones where ricochet comes in play.   You'll like the range. It's pretty much empty on weekdays.
memphis,33bwqi,AHappyMeal,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:51:09 2015 UTC,"What do you shoot?  I mostly do shotgun (Wobble and Trap, not good enough for skeet yet.)  And I like doing pistol as well."

I do have some hand guns too though. I have a 9mm, .357 mag, and a .22 pistol.  I plan on shooting my 9mm and my .357 out there, along with my AR and my .22 rifles. Right now Im tossing around the idea of putting the .22 pistol and the shotgun on the chopping block for additional parts funding though."

memphis,338gfu,Christophical,8,Mon Apr 20 14:09:23 2015 UTC,"The guy who spearheaded this whole thing isn't a Memphian as far as I know. He lives in Little Rock. He's a big Goldcrest enthusiast, for whatever reason. If he felt like someone in Alabama was going to produce a beer more in line with his thoughts or had a relationship with that brewery in some way, then I'm certainly not going to blame him. I think it's a cool thing that it happened. I think the Memphis breweries are doing a great job. And I don't think those ideas are mutually exclusive.  I'm all for supporting local businesses and for supporting Memphis businesses. This doesn't seem like it's done in any kind of an underhanded way."
memphis,338gfu,neimsy,2,Mon Apr 20 15:37:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I just think that it would nice to of been able to bring the brand back with a local manufacturer for a full win-win situation.
memphis,338gfu,rappinkapc,7,Mon Apr 20 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if the Memphis breweries passed on this.  They are all pretty small, and I would guess they are producing at close to their max capacity. Brewing a lager like can actually somewhat difficult for a smaller brewery because it has to be stored (AKA ""lagered"") for several weeks, which can take up valuable space and equipment.  I could be wrong, but it appears that Blue Pants is both slightly larger than any of the Memphis breweries and that they brew more styles of beer than any of the local breweries."
memphis,338gfu,hawk121,4,Mon Apr 20 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"This right here. It is an actual lager, and the time it takes to lager it in their conditioning tanks is time the local guys could be pumping out more beer to the community. Time = money.  That said, I wonder if they approached City Brewing here in Memphis to get it done. They are strictly a contract brewer (i.e., they brew Shipyard for the SE/Midwest region). I wonder if they're just too big for the volume Goldcrest needs?"
memphis,338gfu,OleMissAMS,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'd venture to say it's not really a lager. I think the recipe the guy ""found in an attic"" might be BS, because that beer is anything but a ""golden lager."" It's cloudy with yeast, banana-y, estery, and resembles a hefeweizen more than anything. No way in hell that beer was fermented cold."
memphis,338gfu,hawk121,5,Mon Apr 20 23:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's almost like we had different beers. The one I had was clear, had slight esters, but also had a hint of that sulphur you would notice in some German lagers. Also a hit of what I would consider Saaz in the aroma. As someone in my group pointed out, it was as if a craft brewer did a PBR/Old Style clone/homage beer.  I do agree the attic story is probably more marketing than reality. But I suspect Blue Pants is doing an accelerated lager fermentation. And for the cloudy point, maybe they were in a rush, and there was some yeast/trub sucked into the kegs during packaging that later settled out? I visited on Saturday, so 2 days after the initial tapping. Trub could have settled out or been served...probably all in your glass. :)"
memphis,338gfu,OleMissAMS,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. It's also quite possible that they had the wrong keg hooked up to the line. You'd think that'd be pretty unlikely, but I've seen it happen before. (coughcoughLocal )"
memphis,338gfu,unloose_the_moose,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"Memphis Made brewed a beer special for Revival.  It's weak they took it out of the city, or even out of state.  Plus, both Wiseacre and High Cotton have beers that they age longer than lagers."
memphis,338gfu,devpsaux,2,Mon Apr 20 15:18:07 2015 UTC,Aging is not the same as lagering. Lagering is done during fermentation and requires precise extended temperature control. Aging a beer is done after fermentation and is not subject to the same temperatures.
memphis,338gfu,CircleJerkEnthusiast,2,Tue Apr 21 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"The Goldcrest 51 that was at the TN Brewery this last weekend wasn't even that good. Watery taste (even though their website claims it isn't watered down), slightly sour, very similar to other American lagers like Budweiser and friends. I tried it because I like history and it seemed like the right thing to do, being in the very place that was built to produce it. I don't mind it being made in Alabama since I doubt it will be a popular drink anyway."
memphis,338gfu,neimsy,0,Mon Apr 20 14:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm certain it's not a goo beer. American beer is notorious for being bad for a reason. Now, obviously, the US has the best beer culture and products in the world bar none. But back when Goldcrest was popular, American beers didn't bring a lot to the table. Just a fun gimmick more than anything. I think it's cool that they did it. But I don't think anyone was expecting it to be especially good."

Just a few comic books in the back that get switched our every week and a some jumper cables. Sucks that you got broken into, but that'd not unheard of around Cooper-Young. People feel safer there for some reason and present themselves as easy targets, especially when you park far away from everything 'cause its crowded.  When I lived on Poplar and Avalon and parked on the street I would have people approach me and ask for the change they could see in my car. The second time this happened I stopped keeping change in the car. Backpacks, any sort of electronic and/or equipment (chargers included), money, food, CDs, or clothes should not be visible. Rule of thumb, would you leave it on the roof of your car? Then don't make it visible in the car.  This of course sounds a lot like victim blaming and I'm sorry for that. Sometimes people do just break into cars and root around, so I apologize if this was the case."

For bbq I would go central bbq downtown if you don't want to travel far, otherwise I would go to Memphis bbq company or interstate bbq. Memphis bbq company is actually in Mississippi but is currently winning a lot of awards. Check out brewery untapped. There are a lot of festivals going on right now, so check and see which ones are going on when you are here. Grizzlies are in the playoffs right now so you might be able to catch a game while you are here. Dyers burgers is a famous burger place.

Main St. in this area is a pedestrian walkway which is really nice and there are lots of restaurants within a short walk. Still within walking distance of the farmers market that was mentioned being by south bluff. There's nothing really North of here, but that'll probably change as there'll be more traffic soon from bass pro shops. I don't recommend the renaissance apartments that are near by as they felt run down when I visited. I recommend coming in for a few days and visiting a few different places to see what area of downtown you like, also might take a look at things in cooper young or overton square areas as both are pretty happening places."
memphis,331je8,tacojohn48,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:01:34 2015 UTC,What do your utilities run you? One plus about the Renaissance (maybe the only?) is the included utilities. -I'm not sure what utilities would cost in Memphis.
memphis,331je8,Graciefunk,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:54:35 2015 UTC,Typically like $50. I think through the coldest part of winter it went to $80. Another thing to consider is number 10 main has in unit washer and dryers where renaissance has a shared laundry room. Makes a big difference.
memphis,331je8,KalEl48,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Very big difference. I have a washer/dryer in my place now, and I just don't know if I could give it up... convenience is king.  Now if a one bedroom could come open before my job starts..."

memphis,331je8,SrEllipsis,6,Sun Apr 19 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"South Bluffs Apartments... Currently live there and love it. You can walk everywhere. South Main is THE up and coming area of downtown. Farmers market that you can walk to on Saturday. Quick walk to Tom Lee Park. 2 pools. Gated neighborhood that is beautiful with tons of really nice houses. I cannot think of many negatives. I personally would avoid Mud Island... While it is nice, downtown is not very easily accessible via walking."
memphis,331je8,makeupdr89,3,Sat Apr 18 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"We live in South Junction; highly recommend. Complexes are brand new and prices are great. Ton of amenities.  Plus you'll be right by the ""old bridge"" to cross over into WestMem for your work."
memphis,331je8,ReverendTophat,3,Sat Apr 18 23:04:49 2015 UTC,I can't recommend South Junction enough. I love living here.
memphis,331gj2,Tiny_dancers,3,Sat Apr 18 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know about reputations between the two, but the U of M is building a brand new Community Health facility that's supposed to be state-of-the-art and ready to go by this summer. Link"
memphis,331gj2,grumblichu,3,Sat Apr 18 20:25:30 2015 UTC,"I have been in nursing in Memphis for 14 years. I know several people that are in the Baptist program and they hate it. Baptist admits more people to their program than they have clinical spots for, knowing that they are going to force a lot of people to drop out owing them a ton of money in the process. I would not go anywhere but University of Memphis."
memphis,331gj2,souperslacker,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:23:35 2015 UTC,I'm in healthcare and would second this as the common opinion.
memphis,331gj2,8080david,4,Thu Apr 23 18:32:43 2015 UTC,I dont know much about the schools. If you plan on hospital nursing I would not work at a Baptist hospital. Though they will make payments on your student loan they seriously overload their nurses with patients. If you care about providing quality care without having a mental breakdown I would check out Methodist or St. Francis for employment options.
memphis,331gj2,Donkey4life,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I can't second this enough! I made it 8 years in the Methodist system, 10 years at the Med and 10 months at Baptist. Just not a great work environment."
memphis,331gj2,nvisible,3,Sun Apr 26 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"Hello! I would advise you to study nursing at the University of Memphis! I've heard not so favorable reviews about the Baptist school. My mother speaks highly of U of M nursing grads as some of them work with her in the NICU. I'm a little biased since U of M is my alma mater, however. Lol. Loewenberg trains their nursing students really well."
memphis,331gj2,Azuteor,3,Sun Apr 19 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you were downvoted. However, there are great nurses that come out of Baptist too not just Memphis or UTHSC.   :/ I hear a lot about the difference in training between Memphis and Baptist grads at work. It's a little discouraging as I come from Baptist."
memphis,331gj2,ShinMalphur,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:09:46 2015 UTC,My wife is currently in the program at U of M and has several friends that have already graduated from both programs. No one that performed decently in school has had an issue obtaining work throughout the city. There are differences in the programs that depend on your preference but I think as long as you perform well the name on the degree doesn't make a big difference.
memphis,331gj2,mourningmage,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:54:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how much help I would be. But I will tell you what my  impression has been. I have a bachelors from Memphis State University and I also have a recent bachelor of nursing from Baptist.   The reputation of both schools seem to be pretty good. However Baptist is more expensive. And if the Religious aspect of the program is a problem for you then I would not choose baptist it is  prevalent throughout the program. Baptist takes the spiritual aspect very seriously.  Since graduating a couple of years ago a couple of physicians have mentioned that nurses who come out of a fast track program do not seem that prepared. Memphis has offered that program in the past as well as UT and Union University.   Hope that helps a little feel free to ask any questions and Good Luck!

memphis,32xmco,Azuteor,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:16:41 2015 UTC,Completely agree. It really seems like they didn't anticipate the turnout they had. Hopefully they will learn and it will be better next year. It was still beautiful day outside during most of it though.

Yup, my group and I waited almost an hour at the grilled cheese line and when we were almost there, they were down to 7 sandwiches. There were fifteen in front of us and a substantial amount of people behind. It sucked, we should have tried other trucks.   Next time, they should over prepare because Memphians LOVE to eat."
