notinteresting,3e27xs,nixle,18,Tue Jul 21 12:39:17 2015 UTC,Some of it is still there.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Saucebergenstein,8,Tue Jul 21 14:04:06 2015 UTC,You can replace the jug that holds the water with one that has more water in it.
notinteresting,3e27xs,jorsiem,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:45 2015 UTC,^ jug somewhat full kind of person.
notinteresting,3e27xs,bastardman,11,Tue Jul 21 20:02:09 2015 UTC,The pattern on the chair neither pleases or displeases me.
notinteresting,3e27xs,ShishTaouk,9,Tue Jul 21 13:32:00 2015 UTC,One door is open and one door is ajar.
notinteresting,3e27xs,TheWordThis,6,Tue Jul 21 12:32:10 2015 UTC,A third door is closed.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Shadax,4,Tue Jul 21 13:24:52 2015 UTC,A fourth door is out of view.  Purely speculation though.
notinteresting,3e27xs,PirateOldwin,8,Tue Jul 21 18:48:27 2015 UTC,I know where you don't work.
notinteresting,3e27xs,TheIrateSPider,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:13 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.
notinteresting,3e27xs,iamPause,6,Tue Jul 21 18:49:26 2015 UTC,Do you work in the break room?
notinteresting,3e27xs,LordRedbeard,8,Tue Jul 21 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"No, I'm attending training. Why so interested?"
notinteresting,3e27xs,Saucebergenstein,10,Tue Jul 21 14:10:42 2015 UTC,Dial it back buddy. That was almost interesting.
notinteresting,3e27xs,A_Cheeky_Fuck,9,Tue Jul 21 14:54:56 2015 UTC,Interesting comments are okay
notinteresting,3e27xs,Jubguy3,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:24 2015 UTC,Huh.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Bigolbillyboy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:23 2015 UTC,You misspelled room. That isn't necessarily unusual.
notinteresting,3e27xs,esa_A,5,Tue Jul 21 17:16:17 2015 UTC,What brand of carpet is that?
notinteresting,3e27xs,Ucatsuton,15,Tue Jul 21 17:21:53 2015 UTC,Red
notinteresting,3e27xs,Vespadri,9,Tue Jul 21 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"That is a colour, not a brand."
notinteresting,3e27xs,jorsiem,6,Tue Jul 21 13:20:30 2015 UTC,It could be brand as well. Maybe. I don't know much about carpet manufacturers.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Ucatsuton,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:32 2015 UTC,You spell color in a different way than I do.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Bigolbillyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:53 2015 UTC,Indeed. That is because I live in Canada. I also write grey instead of gray.
notinteresting,3e27xs,lardman1,4,Tue Jul 21 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Please don't mess around with me, I really want to know."
notinteresting,3e27xs,Bigolbillyboy,4,Tue Jul 21 20:00:06 2015 UTC,I don't know what brand it is.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Silverlane,3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:56 2015 UTC,Are you sure?
notinteresting,3e27xs,We_Are_Grooot,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:39 2015 UTC,I am sure that I am unsure.
notinteresting,3e27xs,TiskiGTRW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:49 2015 UTC,I can confirm even though I don't really know you.
notinteresting,3e27xs,rape-and-run,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"The poster taught me to be aware of my surroundings. I am now, thanks to that poster."

notinteresting,3e27xs,mykarmadoesntmatter,3,Tue Jul 21 20:01:27 2015 UTC,I read this comment with a dangerous amount of feeling. Slow it down.
notinteresting,3e27xs,Phrea,3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:34 2015 UTC,INTERESTING COMMENTS ARE ALLOWED. Read the sidebar before downvoting for no reason.
notinteresting,3e27xs,R_TOKAR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:50 2015 UTC,Why can't you tie your dreadlocks to stuff and hang?
notinteresting,3e27xs,The_Yar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:06 2015 UTC,Having a hand sanitizer dispenser in an office is important in helping to not spread sickness or disease.

notinteresting,3e2mcy,sketchedfix,4,Tue Jul 21 15:26:13 2015 UTC,Not with that attitude.
notinteresting,3e2mcy,Purolator50,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:31 2015 UTC,You are correct.
notinteresting,3e2mcy,BryceDaBaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't suggest trying to comb your hair with it ether.
notinteresting,3e2mcy,Ashkanar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:35 2015 UTC,I have the same deodorant. I usually get the ones that are white and powder but this was the only one available at the time.
notinteresting,3e2mcy,Kevinmeowertons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:52 2015 UTC,I use this as my deodorant
notinteresting,3e2mcy,Jayb0b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"I use a different kind of dish soap than you, probably"
notinteresting,3e2mcy,ihaveapentax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:16 2015 UTC,You probably could but I imagine it wouldn't taste very nice and doesn't have the same cleaning effects as regular toothpaste
notinteresting,3e17ql,KevlarYarmulke,23,Tue Jul 21 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I didn't know street lights were that big."
notinteresting,3e17ql,efbo,29,Tue Jul 21 08:40:33 2015 UTC,"Traffic lights are also bigger than you might think.   Lights that hang above your head in general are bigger than they might at first appear. Especially stars. If you held one of those in your hands like this man is holding a street light, you couldn't. Because it's a star and you're a person."
notinteresting,3e17ql,sean800,14,Tue Jul 21 09:58:36 2015 UTC,"Calm down, that's way too interesting."

notinteresting,3e17ql,Workie123,2,Tue Jul 21 11:09:34 2015 UTC,Things that are far away appear smaller.
notinteresting,3e17ql,latticusnon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:54 2015 UTC,Seriously. Is there a way to flag this as too interesting.
notinteresting,3e17ql,yourmother-athon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:12 2015 UTC,Happy anniversary.
notinteresting,3e17ql,Bigolbillyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:01 2015 UTC,ok
notinteresting,3e1sj8,StoplightManifesto,10,Tue Jul 21 08:17:00 2015 UTC,You will go to sleep eventually.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,BindeDSA,8,Tue Jul 21 08:59:58 2015 UTC,you are right.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,Workie123,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:48 2015 UTC,Have you slept yet?
notinteresting,3e1sj8,DickMcMuffin,5,Tue Jul 21 11:04:08 2015 UTC,It has been an hour. I think OP is now visiting slumber land.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,Workie123,4,Tue Jul 21 12:22:41 2015 UTC,I like to sleep.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,nixame,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:24:19 2015 UTC,Unless you die before you sleep. But let's hope that doesn't happen.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,Richard_Fist,6,Tue Jul 21 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"Are you asleep now?  Edit: Because he has not responded, I will assume he is asleep."
notinteresting,3e1sj8,R_TOKAR,4,Tue Jul 21 12:41:21 2015 UTC,I was asleep 2 hours ago but now I am awake.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,bastardman,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:06 2015 UTC,I just check and I am not asleep.
notinteresting,3e1sj8,ZugNachPankow,3,Tue Jul 21 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"I confirm that indeed, you were not asleep at the time your comment was published."
notinteresting,3e1sj8,omicronperseiB8,3,Tue Jul 21 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"Neither am I. I should be, considering it's 5:00 AM where I am."
notinteresting,3e1sj8,Wanted9867,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:25 2015 UTC,Confirmed. Asked coworker to check. He says I'm still awake too.
notinteresting,3e367u,Smittyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:10 2015 UTC,That is a Mac.
notinteresting,3e367u,We_Are_Grooot,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:13 2015 UTC,Mac is a computer brand. I also know someone named Mac. That doesn't really matter.
notinteresting,3e233v,tayz98,5,Tue Jul 21 10:43:49 2015 UTC,I heard a lot of things that didn't change my life.
notinteresting,3e233v,Workie123,5,Tue Jul 21 11:05:27 2015 UTC,Ok.
notinteresting,3e233v,AngryHugo,4,Tue Jul 21 12:47:41 2015 UTC,I heard something similar too.
notinteresting,3e233v,MrCheez5,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:49 2015 UTC,You probably heard it here.
notinteresting,3e233v,ReddiSteddiGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:24:34 2015 UTC,This sub has changed my life...  ...in a trivial and altogether meaningless way.

notinteresting,3e1cil,Bigolbillyboy,5,Tue Jul 21 12:26:43 2015 UTC,This comment chain is getting too interesting. Cannot handle it

notinteresting,3dxlya,elephantrambo,65,Mon Jul 20 11:09:58 2015 UTC,It reminds me of paper
notinteresting,3dxlya,Phasmore,49,Mon Jul 20 11:53:06 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia: Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibers, typically cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a very versatile material with many uses; whilst the most common one is for writing and printing upon, it is also widely used as a packaging material; in many cleaning products; in a number of industrial and construction processes, and even as a food ingredient – particularly in Asian cultures"
notinteresting,3dxlya,Phasmore,59,Mon Jul 20 11:55:10 2015 UTC,Yes that's it
notinteresting,3dxlya,jonomw,7,Mon Jul 20 12:28:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, now I am sure that's it too."
notinteresting,3dxlya,sugottopua,5,Mon Jul 20 19:42:31 2015 UTC,That is also not interesting.
notinteresting,3dxlya,maikcollos,17,Mon Jul 20 18:13:18 2015 UTC,But the asian food part kinda is.  Reported
notinteresting,3dxlya,synth3tk,9,Mon Jul 20 18:14:36 2015 UTC,Interesting comments are ok.

notinteresting,3dxlya,MuffinAlibaba,13,Mon Jul 20 18:40:48 2015 UTC,I thought so.
notinteresting,3dxlya,RedDeadRevengeance,7,Mon Jul 20 18:42:26 2015 UTC,you can tell by how pure white it is. most wallpapers start getting smudges by the first week.
notinteresting,3dxlya,ZirconCode,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:30 2015 UTC,Did you tile it to fit?

notinteresting,3dxlya,Workie123,16,Mon Jul 20 11:24:39 2015 UTC,Do you want a tutorial made?
notinteresting,3dxlya,Workie123,16,Mon Jul 20 11:42:44 2015 UTC,Yes
notinteresting,3dxlya,MikeMo243,36,Mon Jul 20 12:26:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, noted."
notinteresting,3dxlya,Workie123,9,Mon Jul 20 12:35:04 2015 UTC,Thanks.
notinteresting,3dxlya,Name0fTheUser,7,Mon Jul 20 12:54:34 2015 UTC,He probably won't give a tutorial though.
notinteresting,3dxlya,P1xels,10,Mon Jul 20 17:00:50 2015 UTC,That's ok. I was not keen on the tutorial.
notinteresting,3dxlya,HiCallMeBoof,8,Mon Jul 20 17:28:39 2015 UTC,That is slightly contradictory.
notinteresting,3dxlya,onearmedscissor17,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't really"
notinteresting,3dxlya,Nynm,4,Mon Jul 20 21:51:18 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be something
notinteresting,3dxlya,aeosynth,11,Mon Jul 20 19:14:20 2015 UTC,Nice. Can you make one @ 4K?
notinteresting,3dxlya,Nynm,29,Mon Jul 20 12:41:40 2015 UTC,Probably
notinteresting,3dxlya,aeosynth,11,Mon Jul 20 12:43:48 2015 UTC,"Rule #8 Enough with the solid black pictures.       Think it's time for Rule #9 Enough with the solid white pictures.       In an odd way, I did kind of enjoy it though..."
notinteresting,3dxlya,Nynm,8,Mon Jul 20 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"Or you could jump ahead and ban all solid color pictures. That might be too bold, though."
notinteresting,3dxlya,aeosynth,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:24 2015 UTC,Then would something like this be against the rules?
notinteresting,3dxlya,Nynm,5,Mon Jul 20 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"I thought 'solid color' meant a single color, but now I'm not sure. I would be fine with patterns."
notinteresting,3dxlya,aeosynth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Solid color does mean single color in a way. It's like a color with no design or pattern or unique features aside from the color itself, and maybe the shape it's filling. So what I linked is a grid of solid colors. As one image it's not a solid color, but individually they are. That's why it's contradictory to the ""No more solid colors"" rule that doesn't exist."
notinteresting,3dxlya,Nynm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"By that logic, any picture that contains a single pixel of solid black violates rule #8. Neither that rule nor the proposed rule are meant to be interpreted in that way."
notinteresting,3dxlya,Pickles12321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"But we don't look at images individually, we look at it as a whole, unless there's some obvious factor separating them. Like if I added lines between each color in that picture grid I linked before there's a higher probability that you would look at each color separately rather than all at once."
