Modern_Family,3e1cd4,Alvonzo,41,Tue Jul 21 05:03:28 2015 UTC,I'd end it by Phil selling the house after all the kids are at college/moved out and Claire has taken over Jay's company. Mitch and Cam actually wind up buying the house so they can raise their kids in it. Jay and Gloria retire to Colombia while Many is on Broadway.  That or robots take over the world.

Like Phil and Claire in old people make up and flying car CGI and such. They'll tell us about being grandparents and how the kids are as adults with their own families. Lilly even is grown up and there is a brief scene of Mitch and Cam at her wedding. It'll be very cute if this happens."

Modern_Family,3d98qm,dnoggle,7,Tue Jul 14 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"Mockumentary:       A mockumentary (a portmanteau of the words mock and documentary) is a type of film or television show in which fictional events are presented in documentary style to create a parody.  These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself.  They may be either comedic or dramatic in form, although comedic mockumentaries are more common. A dramatic mockumentary (sometimes referred to as docufiction) should not be confused with docudrama, a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events.

Perhaps it is one and the mockumentarians have been adamant about keeping themselves out of the mockumentary up to this point? I highly doubt it, though. I think the mockumentary format was simply a stylistic choice that the real life creators of the show went with."
Modern_Family,3d98qm,clain4671,9,Tue Jul 14 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"its filmed documentary style, like the office, but closer to parks and rec in that the documentary is not real. there is no crew following them around, the cameras are just imaginary."
Modern_Family,3d98qm,sorrynotme,6,Tue Jul 14 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"It's in the mockumentary style, but that's pretty much it. Like you said, it has elements of a mockumentary, but (unlike the final season of The Office US) we have no reason to believe there's an actual film crew following them around. The style just lends a lot to the writing of the show."
Modern_Family,3d98qm,gaviidae,11,Tue Jul 14 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"It's just a style. They don't actually have a film crew in their living room in their ""world"". Think of it like Ferris Bueller's Day Off where he talks into the camera. It doesn't make any sense in his world. It is just a style and you ignore that it makes absolutely no sense.  Originally there was a foreign exchange student who was filming it but they dropped his character because he didn't work well with the show. They kept the style though."
Modern_Family,3d98qm,ben630,4,Tue Jul 14 16:28:31 2015 UTC,Mockumentary
Modern_Family,3d98qm,ashWednesday,3,Tue Jul 14 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"I asked the same thing. The problem with the mockumentary framework is that it has no visible borders. This is not a criticism of the show I love, just an observation.   Consider Reno 911. The cameramen were maimed, left behind in chases, scenes were edited. Everyone acknowledged the cameras, cops and perps.   Here, the crew is never addressed or mentioned, nor is there any discernible change in the behavior of the people in the scenes. Intimate private scenes like first kisses and getting dressed every day are captured by film crews, but Haley freaks out to know her webcam was on this whole time.   I don't get what they're filming. Is it a new Linklater movie?"
Modern_Family,3d98qm,ThreeOne,2,Tue Jul 14 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"its not a real mockumentary, for example, at one point phil tries to break into his own house, but the 'camera' was already inside, the camera is often in places it can't be"
Modern_Family,3d98qm,famicomputer,2,Wed Jul 15 14:09:23 2015 UTC,"It is described as both a situation comedy (sitcom) and mockumentary.

Modern_Family,3cdvph,red87445,35,Tue Jul 7 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I live in an area where trophy wives are not too uncommon, and unfortunately I do have an unconscious reaction to couples like Jay and Gloria.  I really work to eliminate these kinds of biases in my thinking, but they do creep in.  The truth is that I've got several friends who, had I met them with their husbands, I would have made some pretty unfair assumptions about; instead, I got to know them and only later found out that their husbands were a good bit older/wealthier than them, which gave me a chance to learn how smart, funny, talented, etc. they were.  I think one of the themes of the show is that even though the couples may not be conventional (Jay+Gloria, Mitch+Cam), once we ""get to know them"" as the audience, we see that they struggle with the exact same issues that affect every other family.  Cam and Mitchell worry about raising their children right, Jay and Gloria bicker over silly things, Mitchell has conflicts with his mother-in-law, etc."
Modern_Family,3cdvph,salliek76,7,Tue Jul 7 04:31:21 2015 UTC,"There was a documentary I saw on youtube that opened my eyes a lot in this regard, ""The Queen of Versailles"". Now, I don't agree with a lot of the values this couple displayed and don't think their marriage seemed very healthy once I saw more of the husband's behaviour (and, tragically, their teenage daughter died- in circumstances that to my knowledge have not been disclosed to the media- earlier this week).  But I definitely judged the wife, a former beauty pageant winner, as a trophy wife at the beginning of the show. But upon hearing more of her story and seeing the vast discrepancies in how she and her husband responded to a crisis, I had a lot more respect for her as a person and her capabilities."
Modern_Family,3cdvph,Yourwtfismyftw,3,Tue Jul 7 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"I agree! This documentary was great to see inside the lives of the uber rich. In the beginning I thought the wife was just his trophy wife, as things went on, I started to pitty her a little. I did not hear about their daughter though yet! I wouldnt wish that kind of loss on my worst enemy. Thats too bad.  I still cant get the image of that pile of bikes in their garage and all the dog poop out of my mind though. But by the end of the movie I was left thinking 'to each his own'. Just like Jay and Gloria I guess."
Modern_Family,3cdvph,mamawantsallama,14,Tue Jul 7 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think many of us probably started the show thinking the same as Claire, assuming that Gloria was just a gold digger.

I wouldn't ever say that Gloria is a 'golddigger', more that she loves Jay unconditionally and would be with him no matter the scenario, but (like most of us would) she enjoys his money as a bonus point."

Modern_Family,3cdvph,FreddyBeach,2,Tue Jul 7 16:37:24 2015 UTC,I agree that if most people just saw the couple and when the family first did it would be easy to assume but as soon as you get to know them as a couple it's clear that she is not just in the marriage for the money. Gloria said in Season 4 that she did not marry Jay for his money and then in Season 6 that it is only a very small part of it.
Modern_Family,3cdvph,lucasbaker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"I like their relationship, during season 1 people would assume that Gloria is in for the money (as expected I'm guessing). The way she cares for Jay and even the whole family shows she really wants to be part of the family."

In most cases, it may start off as a money thing, but if the wealthier person is actually a decent human being, it eventually shines through to the ""digger"".

Modern_Family,3ben9a,DunphyFTW,12,Sun Jun 28 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm putting in another vote for Gil. I think Lily gets the weakest (most sitcom-y) material, but I adore Claire. She's a great character with lots of depth, and Julie Bowen plays her with nuance and honesty."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,Strabbo,14,Sun Jun 28 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love Claire's character, Julie Bowen nails it in my opinion. Claire can be controlling but she acknowledges that and is often scared of the consequences; there are many examples such as;  S1: When she hires that random band member (played by Norton) and she started to cry because she was afraid she couldn't show how much she loves Phil  S1: Hawaii episode, when Phil convinces Claire to let go; results in Haley drinking and puking Or when Claire realises Alex is a bit like her, and she's scared if anyone will like her!"

Modern_Family,3ben9a,Kittenclysm,2,Sun Jun 28 23:08:07 2015 UTC,Looks a lot like Manny's list where he crosses down people for his Hero essay. This thread  looks an awful lot like that too.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,Spitfire_Falcon,26,Sat Jul 11 08:31:14 2015 UTC,"Can't stand Manny or Luke. Luke used to my favorite, but as he's gotten older he's just annoying."

Modern_Family,3ben9a,Katedodwell2,9,Mon Jun 29 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"Luke's dialogue delivery has gotten very weird this season. I don't know how to explain it, but it feels like he's trying to speak with his mouth full."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,GroovyPasta,4,Tue Jun 30 01:00:04 2015 UTC,"It seemed like as soon as Nolan Gould hit puberty, his acting skills started to deteriorate and his delivery just became bizarre, there's definitely a sort of mush mouth thing going on. I wonder if that's an intentional choice on his end (to make Luke seem weirder/quirkier, maybe) or completely random?"
Modern_Family,3ben9a,GroovyPasta,3,Tue Jun 30 22:46:38 2015 UTC,I don't think it's an intentional choice. He spoke a bit odd in the earlier seasons too. But now it has become even more pronounced. Maybe we're noticing it because his voice is deeper now.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,vishalb777,10,Wed Jul 1 10:57:13 2015 UTC,"What I get from this thread is that everyone loves Jay, Phil, Alex and Haley"

Modern_Family,3ben9a,sneauxoui,19,Sun Jul 12 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"Cam is completely self centered and is a completely horrible human being.  His moments of compassion are veiled selfishness and egocentrism.  He doesn't care about anyone else's problems unless they align with his needs.  I could make a list, but the one that stands out most right now is how he only cared about getting his popcorn when everyone was looking for Haley."

Modern_Family,3ben9a,JoshTay,30,Sun Jul 12 02:25:49 2015 UTC,Gil Thorpe.  The feud between him and Phil is overplayed and pushes into cartoon territory.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,gundy949,17,Sun Jun 28 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"I LOVE Gil Thorpe; he needs to make 1-2 appearances in every season, IMO."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,leiner63,2,Sun Jun 28 20:28:33 2015 UTC,I agree. Rob Riggle is hysterical. The more Gil Pickle the better.

Modern_Family,3ben9a,gundy949,21,Sun Jun 28 16:10:32 2015 UTC,How is every answer to this question anything other than Manny.  He was a mild annoyance in the early episodes but has become a complete distraction in the latter ones.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,WolfJay,6,Sun Jun 28 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"As an Asian being taught not to argue with parents and what not, i really don't like Lily. I mean c'mon, Wambulance? Seriously? Who says that?"
Modern_Family,3ben9a,DunphyFTW,3,Mon Jun 29 11:47:44 2015 UTC,apparently Claire does. But they kept repeating that joke way too often.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,blueberrymuffinn,23,Mon Jun 29 15:26:18 2015 UTC,Definitely Cam. I just find him so annoying.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,DunphyFTW,9,Sun Jun 28 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Cam. He can get really childish,"
Modern_Family,3ben9a,DAL82,6,Sun Jun 28 17:53:29 2015 UTC,Yes!  He's a grown fucking man with a child.  His daughter acts more maturely than he does.

Her character is a bit of a brat, but it's not in an annoying way but a funny one IMO."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,Dismantlement,3,Mon Jun 29 16:30:56 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  She's a brat

Modern_Family,3ben9a,Deviant_Fart,-2,Mon Jun 29 06:20:40 2015 UTC,I wasn't. I don't think she's thinking about her career. I just don't think she should start thinking about it.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,Blacktree2,7,Mon Jun 29 08:06:11 2015 UTC,Lily or Manny. Whichever has more annoying lines in the episode.
Modern_Family,3ben9a,wanderluxe,3,Sun Jun 28 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"Lily's redeeming qualities is any interaction with Sal. Sometimes her dialogue is like Luke when he was younger. Manny... Yeah, not my favorite."

Although funny, very annoying. He over does everything; right from the jazz hands to  being uptight about his baking and parenting skills.  Although if I do hate him so much isn't that a compliment in disguise? Hasn't he succeeded as an actor.  I love Eric off the screen though. He is a prankster and his vines are hilarious."

I think the writers have noticed this, because he is getting smaller roles every year. But his humour only worked pre-puberty, and now he's just a typical, fairly hormonal teenager."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,JonasBrosSuck,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"Cam, he makes me laugh but I hate how self centered and hyper-sensitive he is. There are plenty of examples but a good one is when Mitch brings up the possibility of Cam getting a job, Cam immediately pulls out a packed suit case and demands that Mitch leave the house that he provides for Cam. Manny is a close second. A kid who had absolutely nothing gets a taste of his stepfathers wealth and immediately becomes a persnickety elitist."
Modern_Family,3ben9a,Emperor315,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:14:54 2015 UTC,Phil's the only character I don't find annoying.   I feel like Phil's the victim in most of the stories while he's trying to be a good dad/husband/son-in-law and he's always trying!

Modern_Family,38s7n1,DunphyFTW,2,Sat Jun 6 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"I live in the UK as well! Whoop! Um Sky1 usually start airing episodes 2 weeks (maybe one, but I'm sure they do 2 weeks) after the U.S air date. They start to advertise Modern family 2 weeks before it airs so everyone knows.   Then after the season premiere, they come out 1 week later after the U.S."
Modern_Family,38s7n1,whizzer0,3,Sat Jun 6 13:46:10 2015 UTC,That explains why they usually start with a double bill.
Modern_Family,38s7n1,theacidbull,4,Sat Jun 6 13:47:54 2015 UTC,A safe guess would be 23 September. Modern Family has been premiering last Wednesday of September. Wikipedia: http://imgur.com/xbDN6Z4

Claire: I'm almost 40 and (blah blah forgot what she said).  Luke: Aren't you 42?  Claire: That's almost 40...  Maybe this was intentionally done because Claire as a character doesn't like that she getting old? I don't know but just my theory.

He takes Phils robot and actually takes him to the place Andy was going. Phil slowly wobbles towards Andy (as it was on a beach if I remember correctly, occasionally getting stuck) and interrupts right before Andy pulls out the ring, Beth destroys the robot out of frustration.

I'm thinking they won't address the issue straight away so people come back to see what happens.   I also like KotaaBear's suggestion that she'll interrupt the wedding. I don't know why but I think it would be funny if Haley and Phil make plans to separate Andy and Beth, or maybe they try to expose Beth as she really is.

Modern_Family,370qfb,onetimeuse789456,2,Sun May 24 18:31:09 2015 UTC,This is actually a pretty good prediction. I could see the writers doing it.

The slowly romantisize in this The Office setting and eventually getting married.  Blake and Ders will have to fight for best man though.

Last season was worse though, and at least we don't have to see the pot neighbors every episode, but anytime they're on screen it's pretty cringy in a bad way."

Modern_Family,364kn2,srwright,3,Sat May 16 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"In ""Starry Night"", when Cam is talking about Mitchell's snob Ivy League friends and says the following: ""Honestly, I wish that tart would go back to Columbia and take her weird little Brown friend with her""... just as Gloria and Manny walk by. Then he tries to explain his way out of it and spits a grape out at Gloria with a loud ""POP"" while Mitch and Phil look flabbergasted in the background. So good.  ""Don't you give me an old tomato!""  Cam's mermaid costume for the cat, too: ""This is eight weeks of my life!...""  ""It's Faux-kon disgusting"" -- Mitch, about Cam's Faux-Fakon.  The farce with Mitch, Cam, Gloria, and Lily in the Vietnamese restaurant. """"I think we'd all be better off if people went back where they came from"".  For some reason, Manny saying: ""You mean like all the cool kids with their leather jackets and their pickles?"" in 'Message Received' cracks me up, too.  All of the advice in 'Philsosophy'. ""Older black ladies make the best iced tea"" stands out, especially.  Also: ""You can kiss my wife, you can take her to bed, but you cannot make her laugh. I wanna go back. You can kiss my wife, but only I can take her to bed and make her laugh. I wanna go back. Only I can take her to bed, comma, and make her laugh.""  All of Luke's weird political comments, ""order a pizza and call the cops, we'll see who gets here first"". Also, when he says to Lily, ""this isn't over"" after she shoves him.  I also really love the scene toward the end of 'The Feud' where Cam pulls what he thinks is the string for the light but it turns out to be the tail of the possum. The scream-concert that ensues afterward between Cam, Lily, Haley, Alex, and Claire is just magical."

That was probably the closest they've gotten to a emotional conversation/moment between him and his sisters. (Or am i forgetting other moments they've had?)"

Modern_Family,35vus6,DunphyFTW,1 point,Mon May 18 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. Even if he didn't show emotion through his facial expressions or his voice, he could do so by words. It's that classic example of a character not trying to seem weak and vulnerable (by showing his emotions) but still conveys concern and sadness through their words.   Like I mentioned before when Haley left/ or a recent episode where Luke was trying to distance himself from that girl he didn't like, but Manny thought otherwise.

Modern_Family,35vus6,DunphyFTW,1 point,Fri May 15 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"They've never mentioned it specifically, I know the co-creator of the show said he wanted it to be Suburban LA"

Modern_Family,35jvxj,Daiteach,57,Fri May 22 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"Family sitcoms often end with transitions for several characters. If the show lasts a few more seasons, it'll like up with Luke's and Manny's graduation (assuming they both stay in school, which seems generally probable.) That seems like a natural end point for the series; while the show has backgrounded the younger half of its cast over the course of its run, it feels like it's be a little tough to try to play the series for more than a season or so without them living at home.  Haley will be in her early-mid twenties by then, so I can also see the show building to a series-ender wedding.  The series has been juking back and forth on the Tucker-Pritchetts adopting a second child for a few seasons now, and I'd bet they fire that gun at some point.  They might also have Jay retire at some point, giving Claire more responsibility at work. I can see them pulling this as a season finale thing, but they might also do it earlier - maybe Jay wants to spend more time with Manny before he graduates, and they could use the work transition to fuel Claire plots."
Modern_Family,35jvxj,modernbenoni,7,Mon May 11 04:33:23 2015 UTC,"What happens to Phil? I like this ending, but I don't want it to end. I kind of want to watch Lily grow from a mildly annoying token child to a well developed character like the other kids are doing."
Modern_Family,35jvxj,gir6543,12,Mon May 11 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"I mean,  Phil's real love are his kids. I think him seeing is daughter marry and son graduate would probably be his dream ending.   I could see that happening and then him losing a huge sale and ending with a voice over regarding what is truly important. Though I am positive the end voice over will have many different characters in it."
Modern_Family,35jvxj,modernbenoni,3,Tue May 12 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hope it's many characters, because the alternative is either Jay or Lily. Neither of which I like enough."

Modern_Family,35jvxj,modernbenoni,6,Fri May 15 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"No I do like Jay (and Lily but a bit less), but as a stand alone character he isn't strong enough to do a summary voice over. Tbh if a single character did it I think it would have to be either Phil or Hailey, but they would be kind of random picks. Whereas Jay and Lily both have a claim for it as the youngest character talking about the future, or the oldest character talking about the past and the future."

Modern_Family,35jvxj,mckleeve,26,Thu Jul 16 02:46:53 2015 UTC,"After Claire drunkenly confides in Gloria why she stays married to Phil, Gloria convinces Phil to unleash that python in his pants on her.  She convinces him to hypnotize Jay into permanent dementia so they can put him in a home.  Claire is overwhelmed by taking over the closet business and has no idea that Phil is nailing Gloria daily.    Haley marries Andy and he takes over Phil's real estate business, but Haley carries on a torrid affair with Dylan the whole time.  Alex finds out about it, and blackmails Dylan into doing her, doing her, doing her in the moonlight to keep the secret.  Phil finds out and informs Andy, who tells Luke about it over (his first ever) drinks.  Luke, carrying on the inventive tradition of Phil (Head Scratcher-TM), creates a flytrap that only an idiot would fall for.  It works perfectly on Dylan.  Mortified at what she's done, but still warped, Alex becomes a reclusive scientist who discovers a method for time travel.  After yeas of self loathing and internal debate, she goes back in time and injects Claire with hormones that ravage Haley's face before she is born.    Meanwhile, Cam and Mitchell fall out of love.  Cam becomes the creepy football coach and is accused of molesting half of his interior linemen.  As a gesture of goodwill, or so we think, Mitchell defends him against the charges, and loses spectacularly.  Cameron goes to prison and his cellmate is Pepper, who was imprisoned for killing Longines in a fit of pique over after dinner drinks and melon balls.  Cam, because of his size, his toughness from playing college football and his deep hatred due to Mitchell's betrayal, becomes the big boss of the prison, eventually having more power than even the warden.  Phil and Gloria finally tell the world of their love and move to Colombia, where Phil runs a shell company that invests drug money in Southern California real estate.  Gloria, always looking for something better, steals her sister's boyfriend, who turns out to have an even bigger penis, sells Phil out, and runs off with the druglord that was going to save her sister from her sad little life.  Phil is extradited to the US and is, after years of trials, sentenced to the same prison where Cam is king.  He becomes Cam's bitch, riding on the back of his motorcycle (yes, Cam found a way to get a motorcycle into prison) and doing ""private"" cheers in his cell.  We find out with certainty that the Cam was the catcher and Mitchell the pitcher all those years as Cam is overwhelmed by Phil's talent.  Girth and length talent, I mean.    Claire takes the closet business national, using the Cam and Phil story as an award winning ""out of the closet"" advertising campaign.  Haley, meanwhile, is oblivious to it all.  She stays married to Andy, who is such a good guy that he still loves her despite her hideous disfigurement from Alex's time travel revenge.  Lilly moves back to Vietnam to her roots.  Mitchell, despondent over his moral failing of letting Cam go to prison, then more despondent over seeing Cam rise to the top of the prison hierarchy, decides to quit law, and become a full time ice dancer.  He, amazingly enough, is terrific at it after all the years and is on the brink of national acclaim, but is undone by a nasty stroke of luck involving a nail gun and a circular saw.  He never should have tried woodworking.  After years in the Alzheimer's ward, Jay awakes one day to find his mind clear, his conscience cleaned, and his daughter not needing him.  Since Gloria is now in Colombia doing the black mamba samba with a warlord, he decides to reconcile with DeeDee.  They move to Boston and open a bar.  Because of the shame of his family's collapse, he decides to reinvent himself and to call himself ""Coach"".  We never find out what happens to Manny.  And we don't care."

Modern_Family,35jvxj,TheTapedHamster,-22,Fri May 15 01:54:29 2015 UTC,Perhaps a death in the family - one of the main cast. An Alex suicide or Lily drowning. The death will tear the families apart even as they try to come together to share the burden of the loss.  In the end the directly affected family will shun the world while the remaining two simply drift and blame each other for the inability of the unit to handle the loss.

Modern_Family,357le1,YourBracesHaveHairs,3,Thu May 7 20:00:11 2015 UTC,then why did it get less viewers the following seasons?
Modern_Family,357le1,jeffhayford,1 point,Thu May 7 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"I'm contributing this to 1 key factor. The creators of the show (Steve Levitan and Chris Lloyd) split their company and decided they shouldn't work together because they couldn't agree on who had the final say on plots/jokes etc etc. This then resulted in Steve being the shorunner (basically he's in charge) for the even set of episodes and Chris taking the odd number of episodes.   This led to a decline in the quality of the episodes. Other than that, I have no idea why there is such a big drop between the seasons. If you want more info on why they split working together etc don't hesitate to let me know! Hope that helped :)"

She is overly-critical of Claire and although I understand why she wouldn't be best friends with Gloria, she is extremely aggressive towards her. Mitchell's relationship with Deedee is also strange. He sides with her when she's around but otherwise he is indifferent to what she does."

Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 58 hours to free her from the eight-inch (20 cm) well casing 22 feet (6.7 m) below the ground. The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a media circus), and later became the subject of a 1989 television movie Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure on ABC. As presented in it, a vital part of the rescue was the use of the then relatively new technology of waterjet cutting.

My favorite gag was probably Phil and Claire saying ""No! No...no...no"" to the neighbors' awkward questions. I also appreciate how they set up a conversation between Luke and Alex in act 1 then brought them back to finish it in the tag. The kids often don't have story lines of their own so it was nice to see them doing something clever with them. There were a couple important flaws in this episode--for one, they've drawn upon the ""main characters concerned about growing old"" well a few too many times now for comfort. We get it, Mitch, Gloria, and Jay are insecure about their aging. There must be other facets of their characters worth exploring. For another, there was a weird reliance on using the talking head interviews to quickly narrate the stories because I guess they had trouble cramming everything in in real time. But overall it was a good episode."

Mitch and Gloria are definitley in that camp to me. Gloria in particular has so many of these age or beauty-realited ""moments"" that they go straight over my head. Phil and Claire, on the other hand, interest me as a couple growing old together. I like how they're finding new energy with the neighbours, and how they're being sneaky teens again.

Like the episode where Claire is stocking her daughter with her Mac and just handily showcasing all the neat things a Mac can do.   I also feel like the interest of companies is a double edged sword. Sure, they're interested, but as a vehicle for getting us to buy shit, so the more they're interested, the more we'll sold at, and the less story there is.

I don't understand how networks think this sporadic airing of episodes is better than a consistent schedule, but I guess the numbers are there.  I'd much prefer one big mid-season break rather than sporadic 1, 2, or 3-week breaks sprinkled throughout the entire season."

Modern_Family,33ggxf,DunphyFTW,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:53:10 2015 UTC,"In Australia, most shows are pretty standard, but with some channels, whatever is not pulling ratings gets cut/delayed, like after season 3 MF was like stop starting depending on if it was popular, then the Australia episode came around and it was huge.  In a lot of cases MF is just a place filler on one of our main channels (Ch 10), meaning that whenever there is not a reality TV show MF will be played to death of re-runs every night."
Modern_Family,33ggxf,theclownman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah the same frustration here! I think what we need to remember is that a season of modern family consists of 24 episodes.   A season starts around September, (lets say the beginning of September, to make things easier) if a episode was played every week (without any breaks) the season would finish around some time in February (maybe in march including breaks). So we would wait a long time for a new season to come back around (around 6-7 months VS 3-4 months) which would be difficult for causal viewers, who may forget about the show.   I felt the same way, as I'm from the UK ! :) So I hope this information helps you !"
Modern_Family,33ggxf,DunphyFTW,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, As I said, I've completely given up on Australian TV as without warning they'll drop the season when its not popular and bring it back months later, making it so hard to keep track of and forcing any adamant fans to download it. Personally, if we could have 24 straight weeks of no interruptions I'd be happy to wait as long as it takes (within reason). Thanks again for your input!"
Modern_Family,33ggxf,Zagorath,4,Wed Apr 22 12:27:10 2015 UTC,"The reason the specific timing has to do with how American television shows are rated.    Though ratings information is collected every week, Nielsen is more thorough in their ratings investigation during ""sweeps"" periods, which fall roughly in November, February, May, and July. source   tl;dr- they're saving shows for May, mainly for the season finisher"

Modern_Family,324ji3,FatZombieMama,8,Fri Apr 10 16:22:36 2015 UTC,"This is the most complete answer. ""Next of kin"" is a legal definition that relates to inheritance, and Mitch is a lawyer."

Just in case you didn't get the entire context of the joke, Cam inherited money from his deceased uncle and when Cam says he didn't have a lot of kin, he's saying that the uncle didn't have many options of people to leave his money to, so Cam got some of it. Mitchell is being a tad greedy and says he doesn't mind Cam revisiting his farm days and using the colloquialisms associated b/c they had a windfall of money they weren't expecting."

They refuse to speak to each other and made an agreement that each creator showruns 12 episodes while the other showruns 12 episodes, leading to very similar fights, weird shifts in tone (Cam ogling wet t-shirt Phil with a musical montage vs. Cam and Mitch working together to steal a bowl).

Haley, despite her early 20's party girl persona, has really only had a handful of love interests over the series, one of which was a long term off and on boyfriend.  Alex has dated a bit, but her character pretty much screams virgin.  By your reckoning, pretty much any woman not married at 18 is promiscuous."

White men because they can't dance. Accepting the stereotype and making fun of it is quite common and isn't something to feel terrible about.

Dre would be a great addition as well since for a 'Modern Family' they do not have any African Americans among them.  Wouldnt want them playing the race card too much though as 'Modern Family' is so much more than that.
Modern_Family,3196c9,and-i-said,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:02:46 2015 UTC,I'd rather they bring back Kevin Hart. His character was hilarious.

Modern_Family,3196c9,and-i-said,5,Thu Apr 23 04:53:48 2015 UTC,I like the idea mostly because I love crossover episodes. The writing with the episode would have to be very strong though for it to be good.

Modern_Family,3196c9,Ajs1004,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"Bad idea. I wouldn't mind a cameo or them playing other characters but a full-on crossover would be weird. They have two completely different styles of comedy. From what I've seen of Black-ish, it also tries to make commentary about race rather than use it for a cheap joke.  Plus we did have a strange crossover of The Middle/The Goldbergs where Barry's actor is at Axl's party dressed in a Flyer's jersey. For the sake of not screwing my mind over, I pretend he's not Barry Goldberg."
Modern_Family,3196c9,jelatinman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:53:50 2015 UTC,The Middle/The Goldbergs crossover was an April Fool's Joke apparently.   ABC has a strange sense of humor.
Modern_Family,3196c9,Earthan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea. While Blackish is a good show and funny on it's own I think the focus on race and being black is just something that Modern Family doesn't need. Modern family touches on the  subject obviously, but in an organic way that seems to fit the flow of the show.   I also think that crossover shows come across as a desperate attempt to grab ratings and are rarely good. Both shows are fine on their own and don't need any help from the other."

Modern_Family,314ku5,LoveOfThreeLemons,31,Thu Apr 2 07:59:31 2015 UTC,"I think that was a fantastic episode. It's not like any of the story lines were inherently promising (except maybe the one of Luke and Manny drinking fake alcohol), but through clever writing they managed to build each one into a funny and satisfying conclusion. This is also one of the only times all season they've manage to intersect all three families and give every character something interesting to do, and they even managed to integrate two guest stars on top of that.   One of my personal favorite dynamics on this show is the one between Mitch and Claire so I was glad to see their petty spat made central to the episode. Something about Mitch conspicuously hoping that Phil really did spend Claire's bonus just rang true to life about how siblings interact with each other.   Phil was once again comedic gold here. I'm continually amazed how they can take material as insipid as ""Phil buys a complicated grill"" and spin comedy gold out of it. The sight gags of the grill spitting chicken all over the patio and Phil using the pot lid as a shield and Phil's hand getting burnt, forcing him to release his receipt into the wind, and the grill finally exploding just as Phil is defending its purchase on the other side of the house all helped turn a nothing-plot into a memorable one and also simultaneously developed one of the longest running stories on this show, Phil's never-ending quest to please his father-in-law. Of course, Phil finally thought he found the solution when he found out that he had owed Jay money for all these years, but of course even after being paid back Jay still didn't want a hug from Phil, he just needed help putting an apron on.   Jay was also very enjoyable in this episode. His family always manages to disappoint him on his birthday, and at this point he's chosen to just rise above, buying himself a car as a treat before they manage to ruin his day. But Jay always knows more than he lets on and he enjoys his ability to be of assistance to his family even when they aren't appreciative of it. This was on full display tonight with Alex. Alex is so misunderstood by her parents that it's actually more depressing than funny. Jay is the only one who got it tonight--she wasn't feeling underappreciated, she was reacting negatively to the pressure from overly high expectations. In a genius move, Jay not only nails her emotional state, he also magisterially pulls out of the garage to show her the bickering adults ouside without them even seeing. Jay is the adult on this show who has his shit together the best and it's clear Alex has the brightest future ahead of her if only she can find some supportive people who understand her. Well, she may have found a supporter in Jay tonight. This was such a profoundly touching sequence that I even forgive them for underscoring it with that cheesy music.   I've already written way more than I intended but there's still so much left to talk about. It was hilarious that right after Haley met Beth in the hospital, forcing her to admit that she was a real person and actually was Andy's girlfriend, she went and met an attractive doctor right after. Very sad for Andy, but true to Haley's character. The doctor being so arrogant that he didn't even recognize Andy as a potential threat to his budding relationship (""You're just trying to help this little guy take a nap!"") was a delight, as was Haley's negative reaction to the card that Andy wrote. This is the kind of subversion of expectations that made MF so acclaimed in the first place, always keeping its audience second guessing every plot device. The cliche would have been to have Haley go all giddy over the letter that Andy helped write. Instead, Andy learns that he's not going to win her over by being gushy and he needs to re-strategize. And the best part is, he learns this at the expense of the doctor, whom Haley will probably now dump without him even realizing that it was Andy who did him in, completely unintentionally. Genius.   Finally, Luke and Manny's subplot provided plenty of comic relief and let Gloria do some good old fashioned emotional manipulation, a side to her character that's always a joy to watch. Luke and Manny's friendship is another inter-family dynamic on this show that very rarely fails. Even though this plot was the least important of the episode in terms of progressing the story along, it still had a great payoff with the hilarious gag of Gloria taking a picture of them hugging in the ice bath. I don't know how they did it but they managed to pull off no less than five exquistely developed plots in 21 minutes, a real achievement.   And as if that wasn't enough, the entire thing was sprinkled with some fantastic one-liners, some of my favorites being ""Stay with me here..."" ""Where else would I go?""; ""You know what you get when you have unprepared cheerleaders doing a pyramid? 10 biopsies""; ""I can't drown all my problems in alcohol."" ""You can, but that's just water."" Sorry for writing so much but I think that's my favorite episode of this series since season 4 and an extremely pleasant surprise after the crapfest that was last week's episode. 10/10 would watch again."

Modern_Family,314ku5,jimmytap,4,Sat Apr 4 04:23:22 2015 UTC,I agree. For some reason some people didn't like this episode. But I really liked it. The entire family was together under one roof dealing with so many different issues. I thought this was one of the most intricate shows till date. Only thing I didn't really like is Haley and will. They've already done the missed opportunities aspect and now they are just prolonging the inevitable

It's lost the spark that made it funny in earlier seasons. And when compared to ABC's other comedies - I watched Fresh Off the Boat before this episode on Hulu, then stuck around after MF for Blackish - it does not feel fresh anymore. The kids have aged past what made them funny early on. Mitch and Cam's relationship was fine for a couple living together, but you'd think they'd have either have grown to deal with each other better or would have moved on, kid be damned. There's only so much comedy to mine out of the relationship between Phil and Jay. The writers don't put the wordplay that made it so funny into the scripts anymore. I think it's time they hung up their spurs, go out with something closer to a bang than a whimper."

Modern_Family,315hhz,kjeff23,11,Thu Apr 2 03:33:09 2015 UTC,Well there's the episode where they get the cat and decide that them getting a baby probably wasn't the best idea. I imagine they still want a baby because when Sal left hers they were ready to adopt it
Modern_Family,315hhz,lucasbaker,2,Thu Apr 2 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that episode as well. It was really after that episode that the baby idea was kind of dropped. I just felt like they put so much effort into it and then all of a sudden poof, they no longer talk about. I guess I'm just bummed they still haven't gotten one yet haha."
Modern_Family,315hhz,disneywizard,2,Thu Apr 2 13:26:07 2015 UTC,I think they were like many parents after their first kid starts to go off and get older-they get baby hungry. And some parents put in a lot of work and effort to have another or try to adopt another one kid and they get this huge frenzy that abruptly stops just as it starts.   It's weird but it does happen.
Modern_Family,315hhz,Earthan,3,Fri Apr 3 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered why they let the Cam and Mitchell getting a second baby story line die. I think they actually missed a great opportunity for show material there, because baby Joe is obviously an afterthought to most episodes or is just used to move some other plot along. I don't think they could do much at this point to make Joe an interesting character either. Unfortunately he is now just a story line that ran it's course but can't be wrapped up and done away with."
Modern_Family,315hhz,LoveOfThreeLemons,2,Sun Apr 5 03:42:30 2015 UTC,"I think the point of that whole plot was a social commentary on how difficult it is for two people to adopt a baby even if they're perfect candidates. If so, it was quite poignant of them to have Mitch and Cam be unsuccessful. Some stories just don't have happy endings. They also introduced Gloria's pregnancy at the end of that plot a which satisfied any desire the writers had for a new baby to join the show."
Modern_Family,315hhz,theclownman,2,Fri Apr 3 03:16:12 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that feels that while Lily was definitely a presence in Seasons 1-2, that Joe has kind of been an afterthought? We never he him and Jay interact after Jay seems super into raising another child (to relieve his ""Twilight years"" crisis), and he we don't see him really that much at all. But maybe it's just me and I have observation bias - I think they did a better job with S1-2 Lily"
Modern_Family,315hhz,goodfolk,2,Fri Apr 3 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I feel like Lily had her own plots and story lines, but with the addition of Joe I think they've used him more as a catalyst for Andy and not as his own character."

I really enjoyed the episode, but depending on how long they go on, I'm really not sure what they're going to do with Manny. He's too old for the ""classy little kid"" thing that worked so well from S1-3, and now it seems they just toss him in the background."
Modern_Family,30b62y,wyiotta,18,Thu Mar 26 01:57:38 2015 UTC,Good point. I hope they come up with something good for Manny next season. They better not turn him into the male version of Alex though by focussing on his brains and nerdiness.
Modern_Family,30b62y,Boonedoggle,13,Thu Mar 26 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Alex, I don't know about her future either. Unless they go the lazy route and have her get denied from every university except for the ones close to home, she's going to be moving out soon.. I would guess that either they manage to keep her character going through Skype, or she's relegated to a recurring character. If they're planning on wrapping up soon, I suppose they could delay her leaving until the series finale, but I don't know how they'd do it without seeming forced."
Modern_Family,30b62y,tealcandtrip,13,Thu Mar 26 02:36:10 2015 UTC,They could have her choose to go to the nearby school with cute boy (the one with the not-actually an experiment room).  The crush made an excellent argument for not just overlooking the school since it was close to her family.
Modern_Family,30b62y,wyiotta,10,Thu Mar 26 03:26:03 2015 UTC,Or another lazy choice would be to have her take a year off school to figure things out since she wasn't accepted to her first choice. I think Skyping in could work to an extent but she'd have to come home for every big event to be able to interact with everyone else.
Modern_Family,30b62y,Boonedoggle,6,Thu Mar 26 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Having seen the Haley-Marriage episode, I think skyping could work alright - cut to a PC with full screen Skype and basically switch the setting to her university for her character's segment. Since the beginning of this year, the families have basically had their own separate storylines anyway, and they could have her visit often enough to interact with the others.   If she was to stay home,I think they'd need a major plot twist - Hayley is working at home but not really getting anywhere, Lilly is still in primary school, and Luke and Manny don't seem to be doing much. They would have to give the show more direction to keep it interesting."

Modern_Family,30b62y,theclownman,3,Thu Mar 26 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, that's a continuity error; it was really just an excuse to set up the Cam storyline for more laughs."
Modern_Family,30b62y,LoveOfThreeLemons,38,Mon Mar 30 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"They're recycling a lot of past plot elements. Cam dressed up in his Cats costume again? Competing with the Spanish teacher again? Another parody of the soap operas that Gloria watches? We've seen all of this before. Luke telling his dad about his sexual escapades in the middle of a pediatrician's office was just weird. And since when does he have the ability to effortlessly pick up any skill? He couldn't even throw a baseball straight four years ago. The punchline of Mitch and Jay's plot just seemed tacked on. How is it this camp doesn't even let parents call their kids, yet the camp counselor didn't say anything about two guardians sneaking onto the campsite late at night and scaring the kids?   There were some nice moments this episode but overall it was pretty flimsy."
Modern_Family,30b62y,screenwriterjohn,6,Thu Mar 26 03:01:03 2015 UTC,This show has been coasting for awhile.   This is thematically the same as Claire being freaked out that Haley was becoming the hot one in the House. Plus they tackled Phil's fear of aging in the Disneyland episode.
Modern_Family,30b62y,foxh8er,7,Thu Mar 26 05:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that scene at the doctors was just awkward. I appreciated Phil's open mindedness towards his son being trans though. Nice touch."
Modern_Family,30b62y,theclownman,3,Sun Mar 29 06:34:41 2015 UTC,I thought the transition into inside the barn was pretty funny. Also reincorces the recurring trope of the men's comments taken out of context (sounding like innuendo to passers-by).

I understand Phil has to go through character development, but his jealousy towards his son's success doesn't really fit his character. The tag at the end of the episode with Claire's bra was funny, but it just seemed like Phil only did that to one-up his son. I'll continue watching to see what happens to the characters though."
Modern_Family,30b62y,LoveOfThreeLemons,19,Thu Mar 26 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think it's a total misfit for Phil to be jealous of Luke. The tag of the pilot episode showed Phil playing basketball with Luke and saying that ""if/when"" Luke beat him he'd have to go 2 out of 3 to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Makes sense that a few years later when Luke's coming into his prime and Phil is exiting his he'd get jealous. It was the execution in this episode that rubbed me the wrong way. That said I agree that this show just isn't as strong as it was in the early seasons. I'd also put season 4 up there with seasons 1 and 2 as the best of MF. The weird thing is, the same people who wrote and directed all the best episodes of the series are also making the current batch of weaker episodes. I don't know if they're just out of ideas or are just coasting on their success but I really, really want them to give the show its mojo back."
Modern_Family,30b62y,Boonedoggle,3,Thu Mar 26 04:27:11 2015 UTC,"I think the show has changed direction quite a bit.. It's gone from a funny show with some serious/touching moments to more of a silly comedy ala Arrested Development. Personally I'm still enjoying it, but it does feel quite different when you go back and watch the earlier seasons.  I do hope they don't keep it going longer than it is funny, though. A show about families pretty much by definition has a set end date, I'd rather they accept it when it happens than start tossing in cheap plot twists to squeeze more out of it."

This is literally the first thing I thought of when I read the episode synopsis for this week.  I don't blame people for not remembering that tag since it was literally the first one and a very long time ago, but I've always remembered that tag and the fact that it showed that Phil was petty when it came to this particular subject. So his jealousy is perfectly believable within the context of the show."
Modern_Family,30b62y,theclownman,3,Thu Mar 26 07:47:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is about Phil's problem with aging as it is with his title of ""Man of the House"" being contested for the first time. It may seem weird for Phil to act in the way he did, but it actually makes some sense. Phil's manhood always seems on the line: with his trampolining, cheerleading, fear of motorcycles, and general emotionalness means he has to work extra hard for his form of ""masculinity"" to be accepted. When all of a sudden the secure role he's built for himself is contentested, he switches defend his title in order to prove to his wife and himself that he's still relevant."

The 'outdoor' trampoline scenes that were blatantly filmed on the sound stage with a simple wall of fake foliage (you could see the studio floor at one point) with a stunt trampolinist stand-in for Luke whose face was visible in shot for far too long...  And then the music festival that was basically far too few extras standing in a backlot or park somewhere, not even trying to act like they were at a real event....   Both scenes seemed a bit shoddy and really took me out of the episode."
Modern_Family,30b62y,clain4671,2,Fri Mar 27 02:12:03 2015 UTC,"its a network syndicated sitcom, the budget only goes so high, even if the ratings are huge."

Well his story hasn't changed and Im okay with that. _^  I enjoyed the episode actually, I love that they are making the children more independent, that the perants don't always have to be correct, and that Manny was afk (I have a love hate relationship with him only cause I knew someone like him that I wanted to punch so badly, and I was a nerd in school....)"

I think it's great still, myself and the friends who watch it (more than a handful of people), laugh hard every episode, more so than while watching my other favourite shows: community, friends, etc.   I don't think the show has lost the magic, and I'm excited to see what happens in the next few seasons if they're still happening."

Modern_Family,30b62y,Ostrololo,4,Thu Mar 26 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"This was one of the show's worst episodes. Bottom five, next to the Australia one. Let's look at the major storylines:   Phil & Luke: Phil got the Idiot Ball this episode. Seriously, a grown man being jealous of his son because he's getting older? Give me a break. Phil is supposed to be goofy, not a moron. And Luke telling Phil about his sex life was downright bizarre. Yes, some families talk about sex very openly. It has been long established the Dunphys weren't one of them. Mitchell and Jay: Ah yes, childhood issues because Jay didn't support Mitchell as a kid. Been there, done that. Cam and Gloria: Ah yes, Cam competing with a gay man in a stereotypical gay activity. Been there, done that. And Gloria's soap operas becoming real? Been there, done that as well. Look, I'm not against repeating ideas in a show, but you have to explore them a little further rather than just doing a repeat. Alex and Haley: This one actually was good. Alex's rant was heartfelt and sincere and I think Haley dealt with it in a mature way."
Modern_Family,30b62y,theclownman,2,Mon Mar 30 11:17:01 2015 UTC,I really feel like Alex's storylines always take a back seat. I really wish they'd explore it further.

Modern_Family,2zyh64,-robco,13,Mon Mar 23 00:00:36 2015 UTC,Favorite: Hard to pick one. Its between the Vegas episode and the one where Phil finds out Haley isnt a virgin.  Least fav: Australia episode.
Modern_Family,2zyh64,drbigpen15,6,Mon Mar 23 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"Aw man, the Australia one was one of my favorites! Phil trying desperately to get his family to just be normal for once and have a good time, but they all have better things to do."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,Waspus,11,Sat Mar 28 22:19:46 2015 UTC,"Favorite - ""The Late Show"" or ""The one where they all go out for super fancy steaks and end up eating tacos"", the last scene at the taco truck is one of the best tv show moments of all time, at least for me.  Least Favorite - whatever episode has the least airtime for Jay."

Modern_Family,2zyh64,RoyalLlama,23,Sat Apr 4 09:27:15 2015 UTC,"Least favorite-the pilot. I Felt like they all tried, especially Ty Burrell, too hard in the pilot. It just seemed unnatural.   Favorite-Fizbo. So funny and so Luke that he would love a Birthday that ended in a broken arm."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,Ajs1004,8,Mon Mar 23 02:36:52 2015 UTC,I completely agree with the pilot. I watched it and thought the same thing and never watched the show again for 2 years. I finally gave it another chance though and figured out what I was missing.
Modern_Family,2zyh64,wyiotta,4,Mon Mar 23 13:34:03 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I did! I watched the pilot a long time Ago and Thought why does everyone say this show is so great?! Then I watched a newer episode a couple months ago and got hooked.
Modern_Family,2zyh64,Ajs1004,9,Mon Mar 23 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised how easily you write off the pilot. I thought it was impressive how well the writers knew all the characters so early on in the show. There were several hilarious scenes like Phil singing along to High School Musical, Phil accidentally shooting Dylan then himself, Cam explaining why he's gained weight, Gloria talking about how passionate her ex-husband was, Cam introducing Lily with the Lion King soundtrack. The acting I thought was fine. Anyway you might want to give it a second chance some day."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,LoveOfThreeLemons,4,Mon Mar 23 22:19:51 2015 UTC,That lion king scene made my life. From then onwards Cam has always been my favorite.

Modern_Family,2zyh64,Ajs1004,4,Tue Mar 31 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"Fizbo is my favorite episode, partially for the gas-station scene but almost completely for the writing. The sequencing was so perfect and it really did a great job of characterizing Luke, who, as Phil and Claire state, has a tendency of slipping under the attention radar sometimes."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,peolerson,6,Mon Mar 23 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"Least Favourite - I like most so its hard to choose, probably Larry's wife.   Favourite - Also hard, gonna go with New Years Eve I guess"
Modern_Family,2zyh64,NightofWingz,4,Mon Mar 23 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Favorite: when they go see Phil's dad after his mom passed away.   Least Favorite: not sure, maybe Australia."

Modern_Family,2zyh64,Ridiculousgoodlookn,3,Mon Mar 23 02:37:04 2015 UTC,Favorite: The one where they do Phantom of the Opera. I've got that song stuck in my head
Modern_Family,2zyh64,swedish_canadian,2,Fri Mar 27 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Hawaii, oh my god that episode is so fantastic. Phil & Claire's 'wedding' at the end, Luke and Manny fighting (Phil: ""Kids, kids....no one cares!"") Cam & Mitch losing lily in the elevator, etc. etc. It's a really solid episode.   Worst: Probably that Motel episode."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,2,Thu Mar 26 16:45:05 2015 UTC,Favorite: Las Vegas by far.  Least favorie: I dunno. I haven't seen the whole series but I didn't particularly like ClosetCon '13.
Modern_Family,2zyh64,Waspus,2,Sat Mar 28 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"Favorites: Pilot, Coal Digger, Fizbo, Family Portrait, the Kiss, Strangers on a Treadmill, Someone to Watch Over Lily, Mother's Day, See You Next Fall, Punkin Chunkin, Diamond in the Rough, Fulgencio, The Future Dunphy's, Flip Flop, Farm Strong, Under Pressure, Las Vegas, Three Turkeys, Connection Lost  Most of those are episodes that I feel were both hilarious and insightfully portrayed family life in the US. The others (Fulgencio, Vegas, etc) weren't necessarily insightful about modern families but were too funny to leave off.   Least favorites: Come Fly With Me, Mother Tucker, Good Cop Bad Dog, Dude Ranch, Leap Day, Spring-a-ding Fling, iSpy, Australia, Marco Polo. In these episodes I feel like the writing was of lower than expected quality and the stories just lousy."
Modern_Family,2zyh64,LoveOfThreeLemons,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:02:31 2015 UTC,Favorite: The Incident or Great Expectations Least Favorite: Can't remember it's name but it's the 3rd Valentines Day episode where Claire has the heart problem

Modern_Family,2zppff,Cooper_In_The_Lodge,12,Fri Mar 20 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"I think the plot line was to try to improve Alex's confidence. Vacation romances are something you see in many sitcoms. They also peppered the 'Brooklyn' part for two comedic reasons. One, who would expect, at a Dude Ranch in Wyoming, for there to be a kid like that to just randomly appear. Second, out of anyone to be interested in Alex, the last person is a greasy Italian guido who probably never picked up a book in his life."

Modern_Family,2zppff,bender445,2,Mon Mar 30 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"but then in the next episode that his character appears in, the one you mentioned with the car, Phil offers to drive him home (and he opts to run), which doesn't make sense if they live next door to each other."
Modern_Family,2zppff,bender445,3,Tue Mar 31 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Kevin Hart lived behind the Dunphy house, so would need to walk around the block to get home. If the block was big it could easily be a 5-7 minute walk as apposed to maybe a minute in the car. Also that way running is still a viable option"

Anyway, it has nothing to do with the episode what people choose is up to them. I think the reason everyone is screaming 'brand placement' and 'marketing' is because it's so prevalent and in your face in TV and Movies now that of course that's what we're going to think."
Modern_Family,2ym4xx,Hey_Man_Nice_Shot,3,Thu Mar 12 17:35:16 2015 UTC,True.

The whole thing is shown through the screen of a Mac, all of the characters use iPhones to communicate with one another, major plot points were discovered by way of apple technology (locate my iPhone, facetime, etc.), and the writers spent time and effort into making it appear as real as possible if done through apple technology.

Modern_Family,2ym4xx,kjeff23,-3,Thu Mar 12 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"It's not an ""Apple episode"" for the same reasons he listed. It's shown through one screen because it's all based on Claire's computer. They all use iPhones because that's the simplest way to have a video/audio/SMS chat integrated on all devices (you need Apple to use iMessage and Facetime). When Clarie finds where Haley is, she uses Google Maps and Google Street View to find out more information, so your point about ""major plot points"" being forwarded by Apple services exclusively is false. They spent the time to do it that way because that's the simplest way for them to do it, and as the show writer said, that's what he himself uses and is most familiar with."

Modern_Family,2xn3wf,jelatinman,11,Sat Mar 14 15:42:24 2015 UTC,Like the one with Judy Greer?
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,Chickens-dont-clap,5,Mon Mar 2 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Claire never actually feels threatened in that one. I mean one where Claire feels slightly threatened, like how in the episode where Claire has a reunion Phil is bothered by her old prof. Something like that."
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,Chickens-dont-clap,3,Mon Mar 2 22:02:54 2015 UTC,I'd watch an episode like that
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,LoveOfThreeLemons,2,Mon Mar 2 22:45:04 2015 UTC,There was also an episode where Phil started flirting with thirty-something divorcees to get their business and Claire got jealous. Season 5 I think it was

Modern_Family,2xn3wf,Chickens-dont-clap,2,Sat Mar 7 23:55:32 2015 UTC,You're not my supervisor!
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,cinephgeek,2,Sun Mar 8 00:12:53 2015 UTC,no but I use a stress ball at work and have a very tight grip....
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,drbigpen15,4,Sun Mar 8 00:17:18 2015 UTC,That can work. I believe Phil dated two other women before Claire and we've only met one of them.
Modern_Family,2xn3wf,Jimbo93,3,Mon Mar 2 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the ages work out, but having Salma Hayek guest star as Phil's ex-girlfriend would be awesome;  Her name would be ""Floria"", she would be recently divorced, and she would be a former member of the cheerleading team that Phil was on.  At some point, Gloria would beat up ""Floria"" on behalf of Claire."

Modern_Family,2xh7mu,fernando_69,26,Wed May 13 06:54:43 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that Sofia and Julie seem to be in-character, having claire that envy look while holding wine and Sofia with that ""I'm so beautiful"" look, while Ty and Eric are acting completely opposed as their characters would; Ty ignoring gloria and Eric fully inmersed in the view."
Modern_Family,2xh7mu,Cabanur,15,Sat Feb 28 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"This gave me an idea for a future episode: Mitch/Cam find a girly mag (or web history, whatever) and start to accuse each other. They find out it was from Lilly, and they have a knee-jerk reaction against her liking the same sex, then realize they are doing exactly what their parents did."
Modern_Family,2xh7mu,GeorgeTaylorG,9,Sun Mar 1 00:01:34 2015 UTC,I think Lily being gay has already been done before.
Modern_Family,2xh7mu,dilln,19,Sun Mar 1 00:32:49 2015 UTC,"""Why do you think you're gay sweetie?""  ""My friend Aldo's parents are Italian and so he's Italian. You and daddy are gay and so I'm gay.""  ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"""

Fuck me, I am pretty sure he popped a boner that day in shooting. If Julie Bowen had licked my face when I was 16 ...  ok, I'll be in my bunk"
