SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,LGBTLibrarian,228,Tue Jul 21 12:24:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, on principle, if I was in that situation I wouldn't shoot someone like that on sight. I would probably call the police and then yell at the guy that I own a gun and to stay away, and if he actually broke in I would probably shoot.  I'm fairly certain the vast majority of rational gun owners in American would do similarly.  Edit: Also, it's important to note that Americans saying online ""I'd shoot that guy"" or ""He'd get shot"" or whatever isn't really representative of what Americans would and actually do. It's just internet bravado, and to assume that Americans would ""shoot first and ask questions later"" instead of first calling the police or doing something else to scare off the intruder is misguided. It's not as if Americans don't full well understand the consequences of killing and the value of a human life. Americans aren't nonchalant about murdering people, and we can usually also distinguish a serious threat from just some guy. The news reports accidental shootings because it makes good news. ""Responsible gunowning homeowner defends house by threatening would-be robber with a firearm"" doesn't."

SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,WhyIsMyCoffeeCold,11,Tue Jul 21 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"Eight or nine years ago I was in Austin and there was a road rage incident on the Mopac freeway.  These guys got pissed off at each other and started shooting at one another while driving at speed, like a cop movie or something.  Other cars all around...that's a bad idea.  I don't remember how that resolved itself.  Couldn't immediately find an article online.  This is a different incident in which only one guy shot at another guy.  Austin's a very chill city most of the time but I've seen and been the victim of more road rage there than any other city I've ever spent any amount of time in.  One time I was in the middle lane of a six lane divided road, and I needed to pull off because I got a call on my cell for work.  There was a guy in a small penis truck in the right lane coming up really fast, so I waited for him to pass and then I quickly maneuvered to get behind him and then turn into a parking lot.  For some reason he took exception to this, and turned right at the next stoplight and then entered the same parking lot I pulled into from the other side.  He parked about 30 feet away from me, got out of his pickup truck and walked toward my car very slowly.  When I got closer I could tell he had a gun.  He leaned in toward my window and I pretended to be talking to the police, giving a description of him.  He went away.  After this I actually bought a gun.  A couple months later I was waiting at the light at 6th and Lamar.  Always a big clusterfuck there.  I have no idea what I did but this guy got so pissed at me he got out of his car and started pounding on my window.  I got the gun out of the glovebox and he took off running, leaving his car in traffic behind me.  I called the cops and had to deal with them for like an hour.  In Texas it's legal to carry a gun in your car without a permit as long as it's concealed, but the cops still gave me a big hassle.  That guy was fucked up on meth or something and I legitimately feared for my life.  He wasn't at all calm and calculating like the other guy in the parking lot.  I moved not long after that incident and I kept carrying the gun as my new job required carrying several thousand dollars in cash through some of the most fucked up parts of Dallas.  I never once had an incident there and stopped carrying it after a few months.  The only experience I've had with guns in Dallas wasn't even a personal one.  A client of mine shot his whole family and killed himself.  Even shot the dog.  And he seemed like a pretty nice guy.  It was pretty shocking.  Today the gun sits locked in a case on the top shelf of my closet, hidden behind other junk.  I'd get rid of it but it would just be sold to someone else.  I'd rather keep it myself unloaded and stored away.  Generally I'm against guns.  Too many morons have them and I don't want to contribute to the problem.  Anyway, yeah, people can be crazy.  Really crazy."

SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,Defengar,19,Tue Jul 21 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for completely misreading and misinterpreting my comment.   If you'd like for me to be more clear: ""Some people would rather confront a robber with a firearm of their own in order to scare them off, or, at the worst, injure and possibly kill them than have to deal with emotional trauma and the financial loss that results from a robbery, as well as the possible physical threat of having a hostile criminal in your house. In addition, many people find the legal process and the process of getting compensation for a robbery cumbersome and would not like to have often irreplaceable objects stolen when they can safely scare off a criminal with the threat of a gun. As such, some people choose to defend themselves, their families, and their possessions with firearms, not because of any inherent belief that the lives of others are somehow less significant than objects, but rather for the emotional, financial, and physical security that results from it."""
SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,drswnemo,21,Tue Jul 21 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not calling any Americans stupid for having such an opinion. I don't want to start any gun drama here. But I honestly have to say that this sounds crazy to me (German).  Of course there are cultural differences. I don't have any statistics, but I believe that homicides happen way, way, way, way, way, way, way less here than in the US. So when someone breaks into my house, I would never in a million years think ""Oh shit this could be a murderer"". That wouldn't even cross my mind. That's why I'd never confront an intruder with a deadly weapon. I mean, not that I'd have a deadly weapon in my house in the first place, but that's not the point. Maybe, if I could muster up enough courage, I'd try to scare the intruder off, and I'd call the police, but that's it. But actually (potentionally) killing a person for breaking into your house? That's just insane to me."
SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,Jeanpuetz,11,Tue Jul 21 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"If you compare gun deaths, or even gun homicides, in America to justified homicides (i.e. shooting a robber) there are many, many more ""unjustified"" homicides.

SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,relyne,23,Tue Jul 21 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think that totally misreads the issue.  It's not about stuff, for most people at least.  Stuff is stuff, that's what renter's insurance is for.    It's the fact that your one safe place in the world is no longer safe.  That is traumatic and causes lasting harm.  Plus, if I'm home that means this person made a conscious choice that they would rather confront me in my home than just take my stuff while I'm gone.  On top of that, it now puts my family in danger.  I don't think theft should warrant the death penalty, but if you come into my house, armed, while I'm home - that isn't just theft."

This can only worsen the situation, all the more that someone who's stupid enough to rob an occupied house is probably a broke kid who's going to flip their shit and do something stupid when you confront them. And possibly they've got a gun as well. The end result is one of you dead and the other under murder charges, against the robber having the police on their heels and you having to deal with insurance."
SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,houad,10,Tue Jul 21 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend never confronting a criminal.    Agreed. So if the person broke into your house, how are you going to avoid confronting them?"
SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,Andy_B_Goode,21,Tue Jul 21 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know how your house is. Escape. Hide. Pretend to have a loud shower. If you can't avoid actually meeting the guy be calm and tell them to please go away and that you've called the police. All of this is better for both of you than threatening them.  Edit : thinking about it, it's probably better to yell you've called the police before the guy actually sees you, to reduce the risk of violence."
SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,houad,5,Tue Jul 21 17:21:32 2015 UTC,"Call the police, yell out the door to the guy that I've called the police. Get my gun (if I had one), yell to the guy that I'm armed. Move to an easily defendable position of the house. If the guy breaks into the house tell him I will shoot if he does not leave immediately. If he is still threatening, shoot.  Just blasting a guy who isn't an immediate threat to your life is not reasonable.  Edit: If I don't have a gun. Lock myself into a room with some other weapon and wait for the guy to leave or for the police to come. Better to have some of your shit stolen than risk dying or killing someone."

SubredditDrama,3e2bhd,Andy_B_Goode,14,Tue Jul 21 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"actually, i think there's a decent chance that the guy would get shot. especially in Texas. the vast majority of gun owners can, reading about this second hand on the internet, say with assurance that they would not shoot the trespasser. real life isn't so neat and clean.   now, i cherry picked my examples. it's unlikely that any near misses are actually reported on. so, who knows, maybe ninety nine out of a hundred gun owners do not escalate to maximum violence immediately. but if it were me in this hypothetical and i had a gun, i might very well shoot the guy. not because i'm gung ho about property rights or shooting motherfuckers, but because if i were freaked out i might not act with a rational mind that correctly assesses a threat. we're biologically hardwired to think that shadows can sometimes be far more dangerous than they really are.  which is the problem with guns. they help mistakes transcend to fatal permanence. and it's also the problem with gimp suits, which make it hard to tell a prank from a dangerous creep. assuming this story is true (lol, course not, it's the internet), either one or both of the parties are lucky a gun was not involved."

I looked into the statistics and it looks to be a similar PTSD rate for assault/attempted murder, and I'm assuming the assault rape is not insignificant because domestic abuse is so high, so Im guessing they are just expected to deal with it unlike rape victims because American culture is so violence heavy."
SubredditDrama,3e13ne,Sailor_mini_moon,46,Tue Jul 21 13:39:38 2015 UTC,"Rape victims are expected to just deal with it outside of feminist spaces. I found this out the hard way. Lots of ""its not healthy to hide from it"", and belief that rape isnt that bad if it wasnt done by a stranger with excessive injury. Ptsd rates are pretty high for rape and sexual assault victims- 94% in the first two weeks, and 50% after that. You can find this information here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323517/. Also in the article, almost all rape victims experience rape trauma syndrome, consisting of three phases, the acute phase, denial, and integration into ones life. You can see it in much more detail in the article. Rape and sexual assault are also very common, bumping the numbers up more. The other issue is that youre right, our culture is very violence heavy. It is much easier to get an NC-17 warning by showing sex or a woman orgasming than with brutal violence. Rape is the intersection of the two-it is the more acceptable form of sex to show according to ratings. It straddles this line; often shown as sexy and titillating; a particular aspect of scenes that many sex crime survivors find deeply troubling- especially in a society that treats our pain as unreasonable. The desire for a warning about rape comes from survivors, asking for this to become a thing. I dont hear assault survivors coming forward this way. Perhaps they have different triggers. They also have no equivalent to rape trauma syndrome, arent told their assault was sexy, arent accused of lying.  I couldnt find literature looking at ptsd from assault in so much detail: you can see however, that rape and combat produce much higher incidence of ptsd than other traumas: http://www.ptsd.va.gov/ptsd/m/public/how_common.asp This likely contributes as well."
SubredditDrama,3e13ne,Dewey_Darl,11,Tue Jul 21 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"This seems like sophistry. I don't understand how you can honestly think that assault victims are ""expected to deal with it"" but sexual assault victims aren't. And why are you, in your own words, assuming and guessing so much? You do realize a lot has been written about this, right? If you just looked up the rates of PTSD, why can't you be bothered to link to your source? Or any source for that matter?

SubredditDrama,3e13ne,Broodaskani,4,Tue Jul 21 09:28:05 2015 UTC,"A quick googling brought me to this article, which states:   The lifetime prevalence of PTSD for women who have been sexually assaulted is 50% (10). Moreover, sexual assault is the most frequent cause of PTSD in women, with one study reporting that 94% of women experienced PTSD symptoms during the first two weeks after an assault (9).""

Honestly, practically speaking, it's probably because you can more easily portray murder without making it too graphic for audiences/ratings agencies. The fact that your victim character isn't walking around afterward showing how traumatized they are helps too. Which is also convenient for the narrative - most mysteries treat the crime as just a puzzle, which is easier to do without a victim around.

It makes for great background noise, there is no doubt - look at how many movies use the same basic ""style"" of music for background ambiance, because it doesn't get in the way of what's happening on the screen, but often gives massive emotional cues.  On the other hand, actively engaging in the music can be really, really fun, under the influence or not. I mean, if you are the type of person that gets pleasure out of engaging with music, whatever that happens to mean to you, then the classical canon has a lot going for it.   *Shrug*  In the end, it's only music. It's crazy important culturally, but music is really only as important as people make it. You can't make people like what you like, or in the same way, so why bother getting all butthurt about how people choose to listen to it?"

SubredditDrama,3e263i,_thepet,8,Tue Jul 21 18:36:23 2015 UTC,Rachmaninoff is the Nickelback of classical music?   An astute observation! I would say so: Nickelback is entrenched in the Pop Rock/Post Grunge sound of the 90's/00's. Rachmaninoff was entrenched in the gushing Romantic era sound. Both were not innovative but massively popular...more or less an accurate comparison.

They're probably all under 23 or so. That metabolism is going to crash and burn pretty soon, and it's not going to be pretty. I was surprised, actually, at my 10 year high school reunion how many women I knew didn't get enormously fat, while being a bit overwhelmed by how many of my incredibly thin nerdy dude friends got to be fat beardy dudes. Generally, everyone was a little heavier, but it really showed in the guys.  Aging is a bitch."

(lol)  There's also the issue that feminism is focused on gender egalitarianism, though not excluding other forms of (in)equality. Sure, you could just call every single civil rights advancement ""equality"" but it helps to know when people are talking about, say, marriage equality for LGBT, income equality via government redistribution, or gender equality.   I see MRAs use that argument all the time though. Guess synonyms are too complex for their nuanced discussions. ""How can it be equality if equal is not in its roots!?"""

You often now see boomers working alongside millennials, and of course, the class talked about the differences in attitudes and opinions and really how to work together with those kinds of people.  The thing that stuck out was the statement that millenials are now and will for a long time be the largest age group in the U.S.  They're outpacing boomers, and the reality is, it isn't millenials living in the boomers world now.  It's boomers living in the millenials world.    Which really put it into perspective at how much the boomers are losing their shit over things like gay marriage, marijuana legalization, equal rights, and all that. They need to realize it isn't their world anymore, and it's time to hand off the torch."

Anyone who feels that men are inferior to women is no brother of mine.    I have a feeling OP is behind his computer right now shaking his head and thinking ""whelp, that's enough internet for me today.""  On that note, it's really apparent the average age and relationship status of a person who spends their time going on and on about divorces fuck men over. Of course they do. They fuck everyone over. You're giving up your entire life, your house, your relationship, and the future you thought you'd have together. That's traumatic no matter how you slice it. That guy was obviously laboring under the pretense that OP was going to jump on the ""bitches ain't shit"" bandwagon with him, only to be slapped in the face by OP's healthy, normal reaction to an actual divorce, not a hypothetical one that might exist some day so he can cling to his persecution complex.

A Christian would react accordingly if they truly thought someone will be tortured to extreme measures FOR ETERNITY in Hell.  There'd have to be at least some form of desperation if a friend wasn't being open to salvation.  At any moment their family member, friend, etc. could die and they would eternally be damned to Hell.  Yet they'd probably not act much like it.    If you prodded them no doubt they'd say they could do better with trying to convince them.  Checking on them to try and see if they'll open up, unrelenting attempts to reach out, devoting extensive time to searching for more information to help convince them, trying to live the word of God by far above anything else in their lives.  If they're true believers why wouldn't they act like this is an oncoming freight train?  If their friend was in the tracks with a train coming his way and they could only scream for him to move, would they scream until the last possible second?  Yet here they are knowing full well someone's about to eternally burn in Hell but they've obviously scheduled in so much more before them.  Eating a chocolate Sunday, watching a few funny videos, etc.  An hour or two of leisure time a day could be devoted to making sure someone doesn't suffer eternal torture."

SubredditDrama,3e18a1,PM_ME_YOUR__EYES,17,Tue Jul 21 08:04:35 2015 UTC,"Um. Well, alright, I'm not exactly sure what denomination of Christianity you're basing this idea of needing to convert everyone because otherwise they'll be sent to hell, but that's not, at least from my experience, how that works.   From what I've been taught as a Christian is that it is not a white/black, heaven/hell dispute whether or not you're a Christian. Because of the most important thing that makes those of us who call ourselves Christian, Christian. The way I've been told, Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins. Which means that no matter what you've done in your life, you're forgiven. He'd rather die a thousand unrightful deaths than have your soul forever burn in hell. Therefore, in dying for the world's sins, we're all forgiven upon death and allowed to enter heaven. Regardless of sins, regardless of religion.   Then why is Christianity still a thing? I like to think of it like a really good book. You read this book, and you think ""yeah, that's pretty great, it's got a lot of life lessons and it told me that no matter what I do, I'm going to be okay."" Which opens you up to wanting to live with the lessons from the book, be nice to people, cherish life, love. Should you want to share the book with someone you care about, that's awesome, and if they love it too, they can do the same thing. It's a way to live and love life, as well as give thanks where thanks is due for saving you from worrying about your mortal sins.   Some people still don't think of it this way, but I know a lot of people who do. So I understand people thinking that we're all worried about damnation and gay marriage. But there are denominations that don't believe that stuff, who accept gay people, who do good work to improve the world, and we should be focused on them, not the bigots."

He also issued a challenge To White Church Leaders to confront institutionalized racism, in his ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"", Many churches responded to his challenge with unanimous support... in 2013, which, graciously, notes that they were silent on the matter and failed to adequately address the issues in the intervening time.   The Letter itself was a response to calls from several prominent clergymen for negotiations rather than protests or demonstrations.  He had a lot of people in the church(es) on his side standing with him. As you said, he was a minister. But the church itself was not the entity moving forward, because the church itself was not unanimous on the concept- that is why it took until 2013 for an official response and an admission that they were in fact dragging their feet on the things that he was calling for.  Saying the church organized the Civil rights movement because Martin was a minister and part of the church and therefore it was the church was doing is a bit of a false comparison. Considering that even the white moderates of the time- both inside and outside the church- painted him as an extremist, it is difficult to really get behind the idea that the Church was ""front and center for organizing the Civil Rights Movement""."

SubredditDrama,3e18a1,fungwah,-9,Tue Jul 21 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"Because the definition of a ""liberal Christian"" and an ""atheist/agnostic"" are nearly the same.  From Obama:     So, I’m rooted in the Christian tradition. I believe that there are many paths to the same place, and that is a belief that there is a higher power, a belief that we are connected as a people. That there are values that transcend race or culture, that move us forward, and there’s an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively to take responsibility to make those values lived.   In other words, Obama assuredly does not believe that you must have faith and believe that Jesus Christ is our lord and savior to be saved and go to heaven. According to a lot of Christians then (of course not all), Obama is not a Christian.    Following the same logic, why is he still spending his time with things like holding sermons, and singing Amazing Grace in a church?   The answer is obvious and are directly addressed in Obama's interviews and books. Obama believes in the power of the church to do practical, good things for the world."

She loves him, she doesn't want to hurt anyone, she's the victim of circumstances outside of her control.  She's conflicted and that means she's not a bad person!  And by making it about the response from anonymous internet people, not her own actual guilt, she gets to feel bad enough, but not too bad (is it any surprise she responded to the one legitimately supportive comment).  Then for the final twist, she gets to look at all of the ""OMG you're awful"" as ""they don't really know me.""

SubredditDrama,3dxdlz,UndeadMsScarlet,10,Mon Jul 20 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, if one's intent is to have some sort of relationship with another person, it should be entered into in good faith.  Hiding the fact that one is married (or otherwise not single) from a potential partner is wrong, even if one's significant other is okay with it, as the new partner isn't being given all the facts about the relationship. Everyone should be given the chance to be on board with the terms of the relationship, and while I wouldn't expect someone to include their status in their first breath with their introduction, it should come out fairly early on if the intent is to become romantically or sexually involved.  You may be surprised at the number of people out there who are non-monogamous, though it's certainly not the majority. In US society (where I am) there's a lot of stigma towards anything other than monogamy, so dating sites end up being a good resource for people looking to date/hookup who aren't single and want to be upfront about it. In that case, relationship status is kind of given right away with introductions, so in a way it is like ""hi, I'm Debbie, I'm open, wanna hookup?"" but it also allows better filtering out of people who aren't interested in being involved with a married person than just meeting people out and about in daily life."

Let's look at some of the crazy shit you've said: Realistically I see Ashley Madison as a marriage preservation tool.   And   Not really question, but I want to make sure that everyone else knows what Mr Biderman knows. There are few or no women on Ashley Madison. Ads and messages ""from"" women are in fact from employees of Ashley Madison. The business model is fairly simple. The would-be adulterer buys the privilege of sending X messages, say 50 for $100. He uses them to respond to ads supposedly from women (unbeknownst to him, of course, they are just plants). When he starts to run low, one of his messages will be answered. A woman who is, miraculously, exactly what he was looking for and lives nearby, will start up a conversation with him. Things will be looking really good just when he runs out of messages. He'll have to buy a whole new package of 50 or 100 but someone that women will never as responsive -- until he starts running low again. Personally, I think it's a pretty sleazy business, but what the hell. (No, I'm not a victim. I used to run an honest dating site.)"

Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient burritos, and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent fast-food joints; so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the toilet; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking nacho who had come from the queer dark Taco Bell on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from food court to the deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the intestine, induced by the brisk devouring of so spicy a burrito by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder."

OMG no because they might get my data!  When redditors think they wouldn't be the subject of a privacy violation, they're totally on board with using it to ferret out bad behavior.

For them, cheating is when you lie/hide shit (which is especially fucked up in a relationship where telling your partner about your sexual trysts is encouraged), and jealousy is when their needs aren't taken care of.  It's really not that radical or weird, it's usually just two people who want to fuck other people but want to spend the rest of their lives together. Dan Savage calls his version monogam-ish.

Open relationships and polyamorous relationships, while similar, are not the same thing and usually carry very different rules.   Open relationships are more about sex. You're still in the one relationship but you an your partner have agreed on certain terms that allows you to seek sexual gratification from others. (Think wife swapping)   Polyamorous relationships are more about being in a romantic partnership with more than one person which can also take many forms depending on who's in it and with whom. Those guys with ten wives are in a form of poly relationship. The wives are together but they're all (hopefully consensually) cool with being with the same dude. Or it could be a web of five people all together with each other. Or any other dynamic your imagination can take you."

Its not that we wish them any ill will, its just that due to experience we know it probably won't work out and why waste our time and their time?   This is fucking hilarious because I've seen many self-proclaimed 'mascs' act in very 'femme' ways, not to mention that a love for physical activities in no way correlates to having a less flamboyant personality.  Also, isn't the story self-defeating since the poster picked out someone who presented themselves as 'masc' but was not anyway, so what makes him think that dating only 'masc'-presenting men will solve his issues with 'femme' personalities?"

Masc is subjective, but some people are fooling themselves.   not to mention that a love for physical activities in no way correlates to having a less flamboyant personality.   There is a correlation. I've dated a lot of guys, if a guy likes sports hes more likely to be masculine, if a guy likes musicals, hes more likely not. It's in no way a guarantee though.    Also, isn't the story self-defeating since the poster picked out someone who presented themselves as 'masc' but was not anyway, so what makes him think that dating only 'masc'-presenting men will solve his issues with 'femme' personalities?

I do get that people can sometimes behave in stereotypical ways, but as you said it's not a guarantee.   How else do you go about trying to date other masc guys?   Oh I agree, but the story has very little to do with guys who are upfront with their 'femme' interests so it was confusing to bring it up in the first place. (Also, likes drag =/= booty pop to Katy Perry songs in public.) And maybe it's just me, but I don't think you need a 100% alignment in interests for compatibility.  A personality match is probably more important, so I'd rather think of others on an obnoxious/not obnoxious scale instead. Obnoxious behaviours transcend the 'masc'/'femme' dichotomy imo."

Its not the same, but it also isn't that different to me, both are massive turnoffs. Public appearance does matter to me, if someone asked me ""Hey was that your boyfriend doing drag last night and singing Cher at the bar in front of the crowd?"" I might be a bit embarrassed. Feminine activities/mannerisms/body features/looks whatever just don't do it for me. I'm into big masculine men."

I think all gay guys, especially younger ones, go through a phase where they try to downplay any stereotypically gay or feminine aspects of their personalities to not be associated with the ""other gays."" Most everyone grows out of it once you realize that ideas of masculinity and femininity are entirely subjective and largely meaningless, but not everyone does.   There's nothing wrong with wanting to date a guy who is into sports and physical activities, just like there's nothing wrong if I don't want to date a guy who doesn't at least appreciate my love for supernatural and occult horror films. They don't seem to understand that the problem is that they're continuing to perpetuate ideas that masculinity  can only be performed by liking certain things, and it's troubling that all of those things are traditionally associated with heteronormative masculinity. I can like Lady Gaga and run marathons and do homebrewing, it's almost as if trying to slot people into ""masc"" or ""femme"" is pointless because most people have well-rounded personalities and multiple interests.  Besides, it doesn't really matter how ""masc"" you are. If you have your dick in my mouth, you're just as gay as I am."
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,dreadnought_scout,10,Tue Jul 21 13:10:56 2015 UTC,"Gaybros has always been a Catch-22, and while I like the idea in theory, I've learned over time it's not really feasible. Having a community for masculine gay guys and masculine interests doesn't seem naturally that problematic, but it's a victim of crosssectionality. Between hostile forces like femme-haters, masc-worshippers, and feminine gays with the desire to be perceived as masculine, it can lack a coherent identity. More strict moderation can very easily be seen as too exclusionary towards femmes.   Gaybros as a whole doesn't know what it wants but every individual has their idea of what it should be."
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,ReallyCreative,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think all gay guys, especially younger ones, go through a phase where they try to downplay any stereotypically gay or feminine aspects of their personalities to not be associated with the ""other gays.""   Nope. Some might try to downplay stereotypically feminine habits/interests so as to not get beat up by close-minded peers, while others don't really have the luxury of being able to ""pass"" as anything but flaming in the first place. This whole ""not like those faggy gays"" dance is hardly universal."
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,yourdadsbff,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"But just because someone falls into more traditional gender roles doesn't mean it's bad. Just like if someone is attracted to people who fall into traditional gender roles it's not bad. The point of accepting others for how they are is being okay with people having heteronormative traits AND non heteronormative traits. I consider myself to be a fairly heteronormative, masculine gay male. Sure I have some feminine qualities about me, but if I placed myself somewhere on a spectrum with one side being masculine and the other side being feminine, I'd definitely fall on the masculine side.  And that's okay.  Yes, your point that no matter where you fall, you're still just as gay as most gay men is an important one (but I'd argue that sexuality is also a spectrum so it's literally possible to be more gay than others simply by virtue of where you fall on the Kinsey Scale), but just because someone thinks they fall into a more traditional heteronormative role, it doesn't mean they're trying to impede progress any. Ironically, that's kind of one of the major points of feminism; giving yourself the autonomy to identify and express yourself how you want, even if that identity is that of a more traditional, heteronormative role."
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,mrtman327,10,Tue Jul 21 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"Dude, I'm the same way. I definitely lean more towards the traditionally masculine side of things. I'd rather go to a nice quiet pub and have a beer than go to some loud gay bar for overpriced cocktails, I'm more inclined to listen to Fleet Foxes than the diva du juor, and while I care about clothes and fashion, I dress more in a WASPY/workwear style. I still think drag queens are pretty cool, and I like campy Barbra Streisand movies, though, and somehow, because of that, I'm somehow less masculine, which is ludicrous. It just bothers me that people shit on more traditionally feminine people, especially when it's gay men doing it to other gay men, because it's super sexist and homophobic.   If you want to identify in a heteronormative, masculine way, go for it! That's how I tend present myself too, and I normally like to date guys who present in the same way. I just have a big problem with the ideas that masculine is better than feminine, and that gender roles are inherent and immutable and not socially determined."
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,dreadnought_scout,0,Tue Jul 21 14:36:40 2015 UTC,Not wanting to date someone because they're a drag queen has nothing to do with heteronormativity. Wearing women's clothes is feminine. There's no one who can argue that it isn't. It has queen in the name.   Me not wanting to date a drag queen is as valid as someone not wanting to date me because I spend a ton of time playing video games. They're both valid because it's personal preference.   Are masc and femme dumb concepts? Sure but someone claiming they're femme will just save us both a terrible date because I can't stand people who act like that.
SubredditDrama,3e0wou,CyprusWHM,13,Tue Jul 21 13:35:35 2015 UTC,"Once again for the people in the back, the problem isn't with wanting to date people who have similar interests or personalities. Frankly, I'm probably not going to date a super flamboyant guy either. Not because he's feminine, but more because we won't have much in common. You know what I won't do though? I'm not going to be a jerk and run back to my little circlejerk subreddit and rant about how gross ""femme"" guys are, and how I'm better because I'm more traditionally masculine, and how the evil gay mainstream cabal is just wanting to keep regular, masculine guys like me down, and oh god, why won't my straight friends fall in love with me, I'm just totally like them. I'll politely tell them I'm not interested and continue going about my day.  Also, besides the fact that ascribing a ""good"" value to traditionally masculine things, and a ""bad"" value to traditionally feminine things is a sexist, shitty thing to do, trying to slot activities and interests into gendered categories doesn't work. I like baking, which is traditionally feminine, if we're working with modern, western gender roles, and my best friend (who is a girl) enjoys football, which is traditionally masculine. My liking of baking doesn't make me feminine anymore than liking football makes my friend masculine, they're just interests, nothing more. You don't like things like sports or beer because they're inherently masculine, you just like them. Stop perpetuating heteronormative gender roles, they don't help anyone, especially vulnerable gay youth."

His insistence that he wasn't feminine was portraying it as negative, since he didn't want to be associated with it.   If anything, the ""obviously"" gay teens have an easier time coming out.

SubredditDrama,3e0wou,SweetLenore,0,Tue Jul 21 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"When my buddy and I were in high school he came out and was in a bad way because our area was pretty hit and miss with how people treated gay people so when he met more gay men he spent a lot of time with them. One of our friends was a fairly feminine guy who crossdressed from time to time and a few masculine guys and he didn't treat any of them differently than the others.  A few years after he moved to another town and got more into the gay scene he started getting more and more hostile toward feminine men but I didn't really think too much of it because, yeah okay, sometimes they could be a bit much. I ended up not speaking to him for a few months around then and when we started talking again he was talking about some of the people he met and was especially happy to mention about the femme guy he made cry when they had sex like it was some kind of great accomplishment. He also enjoyed calling himself and his buddies gay, but saying the femme guys that he ran into in clubs were fags and being really shitty when talking about them.  I probably shouldn't have said ""This is what made my friend change"", but it felt like it was what changed him at the time and it always makes me sad to see stuff like this since it reminds me of him."

Her response was basically along the lines of this: I know what I did was wrong, but your brother never should have bugged my phone - that's illegal! She also went on to talk about how abusive my dad had been, which I know there is some truth to when an angry man fears death and doesn't know how to handle it. The worst part is, I'm pretty sure almost 2 years later and she is still having the affair. It makes me sick to my stomach everyday, but I've chosen to stay with my dad and help him until the end.

With regards to sex, I think I'd be more weirded out by sudden chess terminology than with actual ""daddy"" play.   Calling your partner Daddy has nothing to do with your actual father.[1]   And don't make her feel bad for her sexual interests, either. That's not cool, and really just makes you a complete douchebag that's probably going to cause her some pretty big insecurity issues.

The term 'baby' got brought up in that post and I dated a girl who asked me to never call her that after I said it once because her dad always called her his 'baby girl'.

The statistics for continued involvement and having residence with their child are super low. Not saying every teenage father is like this, but it's unlikely whomever the father is wants to raise a child regardless or what he says he will and won't do.

SubredditDrama,3dycij,drswnemo,30,Mon Jul 20 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"So, I'd like to think I'd tell the father myself, but at the same time, I can think of a hundred reasons not to. Chief among them is the mental and emotional consequences I will have to bear. If I have already decided to abort, not only do I bear the guilt for having made such a colossal mistake getting pregnant in the first place, I also have to bear the shame of aborting because I don't have to resources (physically or mentally) to deal with the consequences of my actions (taking the ""easy out"").  But say I tell the dad. It can go three major ways (most other reactions would be variations on these), as I see it:  1/ dad doesn't care at all. So now I'm having to deal with the guilt and the shame as well as a broken heart. And maybe now I'm going through all of this mostly alone (friends/family don't always fill the need for love like a SO can, even when the SO doesn't know why you're upset).  2/ dad doesn't want me to abort. Even though I know, logically, that us two 15 year olds would never be able to make this work, dad's willingness makes me question myself. And now I have to convince myself all over again that I'm making the right decision, but undoubtedly, there will also be a part of me second guessing myself. And I don't necessarily believe that this 15 year old boy when faced with this situation even actually understands the true consequences. A woman is forced to understand because it's not a hypothetical baby that will emerge into the world in 9 months, to her, that baby is already changing her body that very minute. I think that makes it way more real to her. And ultimately, the guy knows it not his decision so it's easier to argue knowing that it's not on you to action anything you're saying.   And 3/ the best case scenario, dad supports your decision and is 100% there for you and years from now you marry and have babies and live happily ever after (or at least make it to prom before breaking up but remain friends on fb).   I hope I explained no. 2 well enough. That would be my big fear. That he either talks me into keeping the baby and it's ME who has to deal with the consequences on a day to day basis. Or he (someone I love and trust) basically calls me a murderer and a coward, making a bad situation worse, and I have to live with that added guilt for the rest of life.   At 15, unless I knew I could trust him to be a no.3 dad, I probably wouldn't have told him either."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,angeliqu,80,Mon Jul 20 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Such claims usually arise because of the thought ""If she doesn't want it and I do, I have no say. If she wants it and I don't, I have no say and am legally responsible for the child's care."" It isn't a thought process without merit but unfortunately there isn't really a great solution to the issue. On one hand you have a father/man who has to say goodbye to his child. On the other hand you are taking away a mother/women's ability to control her body. Sure, it's easy to point at dead beat dad example as being a jerk about the situation or just wanting to get out of child support. But there are men out there who genuinely might have wanted the child and are harmed by the ordeal. If a woman wanted a child but was injured and miscarried, most wouldn't say the fetus wasn't real yet so it doesn't matter, that she didn't lose a child. It's a little dishonest to say the same to a father in this sort of situation.  Again, just a shitty situation without a great solution."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,Corrik,15,Mon Jul 20 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, yeah, it isn't fair to the unwilling father. But you know what else isn't fair? If a couple wants a kid, it's the woman who has to physically carry the fetus around for nine months, risk all the complications of pregnancy, go through childbirth, and then (possibly) nurse the baby for the next few months, all while taking off from work. All the man has to do is orgasm once, and we all know how hard it is for them to do that.  Pregnancy is unfair to both parties, really, and that's kind of all we can ask for until we get high tech test tubes for baby growing at a competitive commercial price."

If you desperately want it but she doesn't you're out of luck. I think the people who kinda laugh at the guys ""hah, they think it's theirs"" is showing a bit of a lack of compassion. It's a tough place to be.  That said, there's no good answer to all the problems when one parent wants a kid and the other doesn't. I think it sucks the guy has no say in the matter, but I don't see a better option on the table. Maybe one day we'll be able to extract the fetus safely and grow it in a lab but until then, no good answer.   I feel bad for anyone in either position, it's an awful one."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,PyreDruid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"There won't be a good answer, because you're asking a bad question. There will never be a father's right to a fetus, because there is no legal entity of ""Father,"" or ""Mother,"" for that matter, until a baby is actually born. It is quite literally a part of a woman's body.  I can appreciate the injustice you're feeling about a situation of being locked into supporting a child after it's born, but the answer to that is better control of male fertility, not control of a woman's body."

I swear to christ, I want to sympathize, but nothing here has convinced me that taking someone else's paychecks so you can have a child (that only you want) is okay. If you know that you can't care for a child, terminate the pregnancy. It's just a clump of cells, not a baby."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,itstoocolduphere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:10 2015 UTC,It's difficult. On one hand I wouldn't mind if the father could give up his parental rights more easily. But if that were the case we would have a lot more children with no fathers. Someone has to take care of this tiny sack of skin that didn't ask for being born or their parents being bullheaded. The bottomline remains: you can't force a woman to go through a medical procedure that can end badly even today (future inability to conceive) and very often leaves an emotional bruise on a woman who was even dead set on going through with it.  I don't think there's a best solution for this situation. Only a third-best.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,Maerunis,31,Tue Jul 21 06:51:34 2015 UTC,How do you justify not supporting your own child because you can't be bothered? Thats a human being.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,thesilvertongue,10,Tue Jul 21 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"The same way an abortion can be justified, like not being ready to raise a child. It shouldn't be possible forever, maybe until 8-12 weeks after the father was informed. To be sure that both want to have children the father may also be able to sign before conception, so both can have a discussion if they want the child and decide together even before trying.  In the end, society will pay the price for raising that child, but it's better than a father that didn't want to be one. I also don't believe that the option to opt out of fatherhood will be an extremely popular one anyway."

SubredditDrama,3dycij,fuckthepolis2,44,Mon Jul 20 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"With a topic like abortion, it turns real quickly into devolving whether or not the man should have a say. If most of reddit (what like 3/4ths or something?) is young, single men, they probably don't have either enough life experience to be empathetic towards why a high school girl might not be so into telling her beau she is pregnant or why she is considering an abortion (I mean, have you met a high schooler? Not exactly the pinnacle of rational thought here.) Or many reddit users aren't even in relationships and fail to understand when relationships are not the best and routinely suffer breakdowns in communication. Often over stupid shit too, like who does dishes, let alone, hey babe, I'm pregnant, who do we address this? None of the comments surprise me.   I've counseled a great number of high school and college ladies. They feel horribly alone and are often terrified if they are in a relationship of their partner leaving them.  If they have the baby, it is highly likely their relationship is over. (I don't have my stats with me, but all you have to do is watch one season of Teen Mom and you see literally only one couple stayed together and they still have a ton of problems.) Every. Single. Young. Couple. Splits.  Especially when a baby enters the picture.  Knowing the odds are 99% against you, even if the father is willing to be economically supportive, doesn't mean you will get ANY emotional support. It means a lot of sacrifice physically and emotionally on the woman, which we have to weigh against the father's feelings being hurt by the opportunity cost of not having a child (though as a teen, I'm not sure that would exactly be a negative.) I simply think the scale tips in favor of the woman because the emotional and physical repercussions are simply a magnitude greater. This doesn't mean a man feels nothing when a woman is pregnant, but we can't fool ourselves that the parties share an equal burden, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy (best, worst, whatever.)  Yes, a man may experience some affects, but they don't realize how much a woman's body is affected and especially with post-birth complications. I have several friends who gave birth under ideal circumstances and their complications were (and still are) horrible. Everything from uterine prolapses, bladder/kidney/uterine infections, perineal tearing and restitching, hemorrhaging, etc. on top of issues with your breasts (swelling, clogged ducts, chaffed bleeding nipples) and on top of that all the hormonal issues, like postpartum depression, inability to have sex, and difficulty losing weight. It isn't just poof the baby is out and you and your baby iare okey-dokey. Even for teens or young people.  And that is without even understanding the risks to  a baby, with all the stress of potentially losing your relationship, losing your home, losing physical, economic, and future security.    The girls I've counseled who have given birth often have babies with low birth weights and health issues stemming from that.  Then, the father bails out of the relationship after a few months. (Even if he keeps in contact with his child, it doesn't negate the fact that he isn't or perhaps can't be an emotional support or cornerstone for the mother.) It's harder for a woman to bail on the baby, between breast feeding and the love cocktail hormone that happens. So while feelings surrounding an abortion may be equal, the physical and emotional side affects of pregnancy are a burden only the mother feels. And every single reddit discussion on abortion always comes down to people failing to be empathetic. You don't have to make the choice, but goddammit, if people could understand why someone might want or need to."

The whole thing sucks all round, but I don't think we have a better solution. The father can want the kid and lose it in an abortion or not want it and be forced into parenthood and child support - I agree that the mother should have the right to decide if she has an abortion or not, but it's not a perfect solution for everybody involved unfortunately.

SubredditDrama,3dycij,missbombshell,24,Tue Jul 21 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"It's really easy to spin it as ""empathy"" when you collapse the whole event of baby-making to one decision, which is at the leisure of women and not men.  Bringing a kid into the world requires a series of events, only one of which places the man at a disadvantage. In all other cases, the woman is at a significant disadvantage, but you don't see people whine nearly as much as that.   Both parties consent to intercourse which is known to have a non-zero chance of conception (advantage score - men: 0, women: 0). Conception occurs, at which time a woman's body undergoes some pretty unpleasant reactions. Meanwhile, nothing happens to the dude. He may not even know. (Men: 1, Women: 0) Feeling ill and generally gross, the woman shells out for a doctor's visit and/or pregnancy test (Men: 2, Women: 0). The woman finds out she's pregnant, and has to deal with the emotional reality of that, and the burden of having to make a decision (Men: 3, Women: 0). Woman makes a decision, without the input of the guy (Men: 3, Women: 1). Worst case scenario: she carries to term at enormous physical cost and choses to raise the baby herself at her own expense and at the opportunity cost of 18 years of her life, while holding the man accountable for child support (Men: 3, Women: 1… because raising a kid yourself is not easy, and neither is being on the hook for a kid you don't want). Best case scenario: she opts for an abortion at her expense and has to jump through her state's loopholes to get one while the father agrees with her decision (Men: 4, Women: 1). Or option three: she opts for an abortion at her expense and has to jump through her state's loopholes while the father wants her to carry to term (Men: 3, Women: 1… because the burden of abortion is pretty equitable to the burden of seeing a baby you want ""killed"" in your opinion).   So, let's see. In the much-debated worst case scenario of the whore keeping the kid, men are still up 2 points on women on the biological inconvenience of having kids. In the more rosy scenario of everyone agreeing to an abortion, he's up 3 points. In a more contentious scenario where he wants the kid and she doesn't, he's still up 2 points.  And that doesn't even touch what happens if she wants to abort, he says no and he'll stick around, and then he fucks off and refuses to pay child support. Which is probably just as common as dudes being ""forced"" to pay support to some willful whore having kids without his permission, and would put him up a whopping 5 points over her.  But it's really cool how in all circumstances, there's a series of decisions that happen with pregnancy, only one of which places the dude at a disadvantage. Every other social, political, financial, emotional, and physical burden is disproportionally on the shoulders of women. Or it's equitable, such as the decision to have intercourse in the first place.  But no, let's whine endlessly about how people don't have empathy for the poor guys (there must be millions of them!) who don't want some money-grubbing slut getting a small sum for the totally easy task of raising a kid for 18 years.  Rather than, you know, the enormous financial burdens that single women face, considering that the epidemic of female-headed single parent households are an actual epidemic, and constitute the majority of women and children in poverty.  Clearly, being a single mother is such a great way to make money.  So, yes. I do have empathy for reluctant fathers facing an 18-year financial burden they didn't want. But that empathy is, by far, dwarfed by the millions of women worldwide who raise their children at enormous cost to themselves. If we really want to talk about the gendered nature of pregnancy, birth, childhood, and more, the burden overwhelmingly falls on women -- whether it's mothers themselves, or grandparents, or low-paid daycare employees. The reality of birth and raising children places women at an enormous disadvantage in basically every measurable index of human success, and many of those disadvantages are woefully underdressed in this modern age of abortion and birth control (much of which is slowly being eroded by conservatives anyway).  It's like ignoring the elephant in the room to contemplate a mouse. It's still there, and anyone sensible can see it. But the people who want me to believe it's just as noticeable as that elephant, and probably even more important… well. It's pretty obvious that they have some pretty big biases in their priorities."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,beanfiddler,-9,Tue Jul 21 00:40:54 2015 UTC,Are you actually literally keeping score on a gender issue? Did that just happen?
SubredditDrama,3dycij,metallink11,-11,Mon Jul 20 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"I vastly oversimplified the issue, you're correct, and collapsed it to only the most common scenarios (as they are debated in the defaults) to illustrate the point that the gender burden of everything to do with children falls vastly on women. And also to make the point that wringing our hands for the inconveniences of biology when it comes to men and conception is totally overwrought when nobody seems willing to be honest about how they know, intellectually, that the burden of conception, birth, and childcare falls overwhelmingly on women.  It's obnoxious, in other words, that nobody can just simply feel sorry for a teenage girl stuck in an impossible situation loaded with judgment no matter she choses without people, en masse, whining endlessly about how unfair birth and conception is for guys.  Like, yo, you don't fool anyone. These people actually don't give two fucks about actual guys stuck in that situation, they just care about hypotheticals they make up to justify their own persecution complex, which is completely divorced from the reality of whom childbirth and childcare actually affects the most.  It's like some white dude moseying on into a thread about police shooting black kids and whining about how a cop was mean to him when he was pulled over for running a red. Yes, we all know that the institution of law enforcement in America is woefully corrupt, but do we really have to do this What About White People thing right now?  This is how ""debates"" like this all go:   Someone brings up how an issue (pregnancy, police brutality, hell even something as random as availability of foundation for people of dark skin tones etc) is overwhelmingly disadvantageous for a certain minority demographic. Someone comes in with the ""What About…"" line to make sure we all know that the issue affects them too, hypothetically. Someone points out that it's not even in the same ballpark, and that they're completely off-topic. Everyone starts a big fight about whether or not white people / men have it as bad as black people / women and whether or not it's really reverse racism or reverse sexism to refuse to talk about men's problems or white people problem's in a thread that isn't about white people / male problems. Crisis averted! Nobody has an honest and uncomfortable discussion about sexism and racism as they exist as vast epidemics and unjust institutions, they just have a pissing match about whether or not men and white people are the real victims and women/black people have naughty tones they don't like.   Repeat ad nauseum. This is how it has always been, and how it always will be. It's not original. It's not intelligent. It's blatant derailing to avoid confronting the obvious injustices in our society and the uncomfortable realization that somewhere out there, someone has it worse than you, and they don't give a shit about your problems.  Just like you don't give a shit about theirs. So, in the end, we can all agree that white people and black people and men and women are equally terrible and do nothing to fix and address the vestiges of terrible shit like sexism and racism because it's more comfortable to contemplate our navels."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,beanfiddler,-10,Mon Jul 20 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"Lets see, you make a long post pointing out on how many people in discussions about injustice to point how people will usually walk in and start going on about ""what about my oppression blah blah blah"".  However, you are doing this in the context in a post specifically talking about, well the questions of a person being denied the ability to have a child. I think you should probably at least, ask yourself about the irony of your words. You are doing what you are complaining about.  Frankly, I think we can both at the same time, try to end sexism while at the same time, at least have a discussion about how in certain circumstances a guy or girl can feel wronged by their partner and maybe think of some way to rectify that."

SubredditDrama,3dycij,justcool393,13,Tue Jul 21 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"Bean, I remember you posted something about your relationship a while ago that might help the point I'm trying to make to you in particular, as the last time this debate came up you were similarly lacking in empathy for guys in this situation.  You knew objectively it was more important to spend some time with your mom because of her birthday/mother's day, but you also felt an emotional pull to your girlfriend despite pure, objective logic.   I tried to be understanding of you in that thread, but if I tallied it out like you just did, it would be a landslide in favor of your mother that day.  Would that have helped you feel any better?  probably not, because to you it was a more nuanced decision.  I don't understand why when I write about being understanding of the position of men in this debate, you respond with snark and a lack of understanding?  Like I said in a comment above:   sane men know they SHOULDN'T have any say over a woman's body, but still have hopes/dreams/feeling involved in the matter.   I tried to look at your afforementioned situation with the empathy and understanding of you being in a messy situation.  Why are you so averse to doing the same in this situation?  Why when I say ""maybe have empathy for men"" you interpret it as:   But no, let's whine endlessly about how people don't have empathy for the poor guys (there must be millions of them!) who don't want some money-grubbing slut getting a small sum for the totally easy task of raising a kid for 18 years."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,Oxus007,16,Mon Jul 20 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"That's obvious. The discussion happens because if the reverse happens, and mom says ""yes, I want the baby"", but dad says ""no"", his opinion doesn't matter. He still has to financially support the child for 18 years.   Well that's how biology works, and in neither situation does the man get to control the womans body.   It's not a balanced system and people need to come to terms with that in both scenarios it's up the the woman no matter what."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,CarmineCerise,-12,Mon Jul 20 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"Correct.  If you slow down for a second, I'm not advocating that a man's desires in this situation should supersede a woman's right to her body.  What I'm saying is maybe we can be less outright hostile towards ""men"" in this situation and realize they have their own wants/desires/dreams involved in pregnancies that get aborted (or not), and they have absolutely 0 control.  That's not a nice place to be in."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,Oxus007,17,Mon Jul 20 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"No I understand the point you're trying to make but at the end of the day, what I'm saying is when you take all what you're saying into account, then what? It doesn't change anything about the situation.   Sure it's sad that a guy might be really upset by not having a child but when it comes down to it, it doesn't matter, and it never will."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,CarmineCerise,-20,Mon Jul 20 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that the guy's opinion doesn't matter, basically? Just ""shut up and pay child support?""   Very understanding view you have there."

SubredditDrama,3dycij,CarmineCerise,-18,Mon Jul 20 18:26:11 2015 UTC,Then what is the point of having a partner if you won't listen to his feedback? Might as well just use a sperm donor if you're going to take that attitude.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,SerElderberry,4,Mon Jul 20 18:27:34 2015 UTC,He's not much of a partner if he can't understand that her choices about her body are up to her and she is under no obligation to abort or not abort a pregnancy based on his desires.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,CarmineCerise,7,Mon Jul 20 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yea and if she chooses to have the baby and the pregnancy was an accident, the guy shouldn't have to be responsible for child support.   It's either ""I'm having an abortion and there's nothing you can do about."" or ""I'm keeping the baby and you're paying for it.""   Not fair for the guy involved but you don't seem to care about that either way."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,SerElderberry,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually. If you are so paranoid about it you should have worn a condom.  Clearly the only reason you care way more about the male in the situation is because that's the more familiar perspective."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,GobtheCyberPunk,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"Condoms fail or people fuck up.

SubredditDrama,3dycij,franticantelope,-15,Mon Jul 20 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"Condoms actually have very high success rate if used correctly, and there are even more fail-proof contraception methods. Abortion should always be a last resort."

SubredditDrama,3dycij,blaakid,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is probably the one subject in which I disagree with the majority opinion on this subreddit.   I absolutely agree that it should completely be the decision of a woman what she does with her body, but each parent should get the freedom of choosing to be a parent in my opinion. For the father, that would mean giving up his right to be the father of the child during the same period that the mother can choose to terminate the pregnancy.   It seems similarly cruel to me to force a man to pay for 18 years of a child's life as it would be to force a woman to carry her child to term. Neither of them signed up for either of those scenarios when they had sex."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,OOHnirav,-16,Mon Jul 20 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"My point excactly, well said :)"
SubredditDrama,3dycij,blaakid,13,Tue Jul 21 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"So if mom can't afford the baby, she can abandon it at a safe haven without dad's consent and that's totally fine and understandable.   Uh, you do realize that the story you linked to ended with the biological father getting custody? Obviously the law doesn't think that's ""totally fine and understandable"".   But if dad can't afford the baby, he has no such option and is labeled an evil child-abandoning deadbeat.   Ooh, another swing-and-a-miss. Child support isn't a one-size-fits-all situation; it's calculated by your ability to pay. And, if something goes wrong, (like you lose your job, or become disabled), you can petition the court to lower it, and it will happen. (That's the step most guys don't do, and end up shooting themselves in the foot, but whose fault is that?)  Plus, let's examine this logic; it's like saying that you get a DUI (a situation with a known risk that you consciously chose to enter) and can't afford the fines, so you dodge the fines, and now people have the audacity to call you a dead beat?! Oh, the nerve of them!   I've said it a million times on reddit: If you're so scared of those pregnant female harpies stealing your precious bodily fluids, don't have sex. Problem solved.  *Edited to remove unnecessary snark."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,FaFaFoley,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"Again, if you are paranoid about it, wear a condom."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,GobtheCyberPunk,9,Mon Jul 20 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but you really gotta stop spouting condoms as a complete solution. Even with perfect use, condoms have a 2% failure rate (and a 15% failure rate with typical use).   The argument you're making should account for accidents where the man did everything right. I'm not really trying to take sides here (I do believe women should always be able to abort though) since it's such a complex matter, but I do recognize that it can suck for the guy (although I don't have a better solution than our current system)."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,AnUnchartedIsland,6,Mon Jul 20 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck that. You can't have it both ways. If the pregnancy is accidental and he doesn't want the child but she decides to have it anyway, he should in no way be responsible for child support and he should not be forced to stay."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,SerElderberry,-4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:02 2015 UTC,he should in no way be responsible for child support and he should not be forced to stay.   And who care's about the child he's responsible for! Obviously not the father.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,CarmineCerise,12,Mon Jul 20 21:52:02 2015 UTC,The government does. They'll force him to pay money for a child he doesn't want and throw him in jail if he refuses. It's why I'm arguing in the first place.  But you don't seem to think the above is an issue. Telling.
SubredditDrama,3dycij,SerElderberry,9,Mon Jul 20 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"Because the choice is between ""forcing"" a man to take responsibility for engaging in the risk of unprotected sex for the sake of the child, and the other is opening the door for financial extortion of the woman.  Moreover the man has the ability to use a condom, or at least confirm with his partner whether they would keep a child from unprotected sex before they actually do it."
SubredditDrama,3dycij,GobtheCyberPunk,5,Mon Jul 20 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Easy solution is probably to use condoms and don't get people pregnant if you can't support a child.  I realize it isn't foolproof, but most people who find themselves in this situation weren't trying that hard to avoid it."

I did however, didn't get the sense that you guys that are upset I didn't inform the man, know anything at all about why I didn't choose to tell him. You do not know his state of well-being right now. He is a depressed kid, who does drugs on the daily, and doesn't have his shit together. You think someone like that would be able to make an educated informed decision about the care of another human being? I think truly in arguments where there is one side that is favoured more, the other needs to feel that same oppression. I genuinely think, the mature men in this post understand, it is not their ""right"" to know about this. It is the woman's body, therefore all my decision. I really don't care about all of you calling me an ""irresponsible teenager"" a ""whore"" because obviously you don't know me, so I am not even going to rant about that. I just think that the boy I concieved the child with is irresponsible, he had a similar situation happen to him with a previous girlfriend ( a scare) and that straight up depressed him for a while, and stressed him out to the max. Why would I do that to someone I care about? I am not in a relationship with him in anyway, btw. We are distant friends, because of his life path right now. I want him to be happy, and knowing about this would not make him happy. The amount of burden I suffered through dealing with this situation, I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, let alone a friend.

What about if the mother decides to smoke crack and the baby ends up having major birth defects.

Can the father micromanage a woman's life and change her diet to ensure a healthy baby? What about forcing prenatal care? Can he force feed her prenatal vitamins? What about bedrest, some pregnancies need that as well to have a healthy baby, does this give a father a right to chain the woman to a bed against her will?"

I can understand not liking it (especially if you are not a hip hop fan), but it has been considered a highly acclaimed and influential album for 10 years now. I don't like Rush, but I admit that they are hugely influential. I feel like it is just an attempt to diminish him by insulting his greatest accomplishment.   I always recommend Late Registration as a first Kanye listening, just because I feel like it has broader appeal while College Dropout is more for people who are already hip hop fans."

I have no investment in saying Kanye is literally a god or anything like that, but it's a good album. It is pleasing to listen to. I don't know how you can call it ""fucking horrible""."

I feel like a lot of people who call Dropout horrible haven't actually listened to it and just call it out because they have heard of it and they want to belittle Kanye.

I love TBAB, I think it's the best album released this year hands down, but without sounding too pretentious I think it's a pretty ""complicated"" album to get into without knowing anything about rap and Kendrick Lamar himself.  I wouldn't introduce any of my friends to hiphop with TBAB, but on the other hand not too many of my friends are avid music listeners either, so I don't know what kind of point I'm trying to make.  Definitely listen to it, but keep an open mind about it and maybe if you don't like it give it some time and listen to it again.  Plus Good Kid maad City is also an essential album on its own, don't skip that either."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,saragoldfarb,2,Tue Jul 21 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"Well, TPAB was the first hiphop album I listened to all the way through and I only just got into the genre a few months ago.

Chuck Berry's eyes pop out of his head but John just rolls with it. It's fucking insane. Funny YouTube bid, though.

The only reason Drake is not closing the games is because he was last games' closing act. It's the Pan-American Games. They always have an artist from the America's close, not necessarily the host country. Drake had as many ties to Guadalajara as Kanye does to Toronto, but you didn't see this much rabble when Drake did it.   Edit: Just because I looked it up: Nickelback, Ricky Martin, and Three Days Grace also closed the 2011 games. Two Canadian rock bands, a Puerto Rican singer, and a Canadian rapper playing in Guadalajara, Mexico. But no petition about that."

SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,LieBaron,5,Mon Jul 20 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"i think the thing that put ye over the top is the fact that he raps and produces   Isn't this just shifting goalposts though? There's nothing inherent about producing and rapping that qualifies more significant impact, relevance or acclaim. Rappers make the career of producers more often than producers make the career of rappers. I'm not even much of a fan of Hova but I think it's undeniable that he has broken more people's careers, had a more significant impact and influence on the culture and received more acclaim than almost anyone else alive.   I don't deny the significance of Kanye, but putting him above someone like Jay-Z just because he makes beats is a little weird.  I would probably put Wayne above Kanye in this sense too - no, he wasn't a producer, but he basically single handedly changed even the basic model of distribution of rap music (mixtapes as serious vehicles in themselves from serious artists, as opposed to promotional material or something for struggle rappers) as well as how people even rap at all - there are very, very few significant rap artists active today that do not bear at least some mark of Wayne's influence on their creative voice. You can't really the same about Kanye, as significant as he is."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,smileyman,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"It's not wrong, though. I mean his impact on hip-hop and pop is immense, and the 'fanboys' include most music critics. Yeah, some of it is just hype for hype's sake, but it's not like that wasn't a thing for, say, Dylan."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,IAMA_LongHorse,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:49 2015 UTC,"O man, someone is not going to like that comparison."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,thenuge26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Haha, right? But honestly I have a hard time thinking of other artists whose work was being taken so seriously as art by his fans while also topping the charts. That mix of deliberately (and successfully) pushing the artistic boundaries of a genre while embracing superstardom is extremely rare.  Besides, it's not like Dylan didn't have his haters or his own assholish cocky moments."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,tibby_throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"It's okay to not like Kanye or his music, but you need to have your head wayyyy in the sand to deny his cultural impact. Taylor Swift can spar with Kanye in mainstream popularity, but critics don't laud her for taking risks or pushing creative boundaries. Arcade Fire and Jack White are critical darlings with sold out tours, but their shows aren't nearly the scale.   Is Kanye my favorite artist? Nope. I don't listen to him too often - he's not even my favorite rap act. But the man's the rockstar of the moment. My opinion on his music has nothing to do with it."

SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,miniflip,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:41:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Beatles really started to push the genre of pop until Sgt Pepper, and that album was heavily influenced by the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.  Some of their individual songs pushed the boundaries, but most of them were pure pop.   Revolver had a couple of songs that pushed the boundaries (thinking specifically here of Eleanor Rigby and Taxman), as did Rubber Soul (Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man), but the entire concept and execution of Sgt Pepper was amazing, and I don't think it was until then that they consciously tried to push boundaries."
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,grundo1561,7,Mon Jul 20 19:06:23 2015 UTC,It's cliche for a reason.
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,Dont-be_an-Asshole,4,Mon Jul 20 19:13:25 2015 UTC,Elvis is up there too.  Blues was a southern black genre until he made it mainstream and rock music is heavily influenced by blues.
SubredditDrama,3dz4rs,youre_being_creepy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think Bowie is a solid comparison.

SubredditDrama,3dxdid,snallygaster,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"...that has nothing to do with it. Everyone can understand how it feels to have their nudes shared without permission if they put themselves into that situation. This scenario involved having nudes leaked on 4chan, not placed on RealGirls or some revenge porn websites. Though it doesn't even matter; it's not about how male vs. female nudes are consumed.

SubredditDrama,3dxdid,EmergencyChocolate,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"Why does everything have to be turned into a pissing contest over which gender has it worse? Yeah, revenge porn is primarily a female issue, but that isn't relevant here at all. The form of revenge porn in OP is something that affects high amounts of both men and women (4chan sharing), and the issue is that the commenters can't understand the perspective because the OP affected someone whose perspective they haven't been exposed to (but can understand it with a male-tailored analogy). no need to turn this into a 'who has it worse?' discussion;  there are enough of those already."

SubredditDrama,3dxdid,demmian,43,Mon Jul 20 12:13:45 2015 UTC,Those minute hints are usually that someone didn't strip the location info from the jpeg file.

That's 10% of the subscriber count gained between 5 days in the last month and a half.  Also, looking at the the average uniques per day, it was about 30k in the week or two pre-Fattening that still has daily stats.  After that, it jumped up to 40k during the interim between the Fattening and the blackout, and now it's more like 55k in the few weeks since the blackout.

Even now, pretty frequently, I stop in my tracks when I remember what I did. At the time it seemed victimless, and even though no one ever found out, the guilt that I did something so fucked up and misogynistic is something I'll have to carry for the rest of my life.

SubredditDrama,3dxdid,fromheretogardena,33,Mon Jul 20 09:41:42 2015 UTC,"""Victim blaming"" is when one places the onus on a victim of a crime rather than its perpetrator. So, you might say ""Sure, you were mugged, but you were walking down a dark alley so you were kind of asking for it"" or ""If you locked your house, you wouldn't have been burgled."" The truth is that one should be able to walk down alleys without expecting to be mugged. Or, in this case, one should be fine with sharing naked pictures with someone they trust without fearing that those pictures will be shared with strangers out of spite. The real perpetrator is the guy sharing the pictures, not the girl who took them.  Honestly, you should have seen this coming. Placing blame on a female victim of a psuedo-sexual incident - in many states a crime? It's kind of your fault someone is accusing you of victim blaming."
SubredditDrama,3dxdid,bonjouramigos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:21:43 2015 UTC,"Surely there's a middle ground here where someone sending nude pics, especially considering that it was to a person that they've never met before, isn't terribly smart and the guy posting them is scummy."

That's kind of the main argument for Marijuana legalization, right? Literally the only negative consequence is you can be arrested. Why blame the smoker when it's better to just not arrest people?  Plus there's nothing dumb about sending a private message to someone that includes a nude picture of yourself. Heck, I'm a man and I send nudes to everyone. Literally everyone I know. I take a quick snap using a selfie stick, hit ""send to all contacts"" and I'm off. It's 1030am where I am and I've already send 100s of nudes and I'll probably send 100s more by lunch time."

It's not wholly about blame though; it's largely about preventing crimes from being perpetrated against you. If you tape all the cash you have on hand onto your back and walk about in a large city, you should expect for someone to take a swipe or two at it. If you get an email from a Nigerian prince offering great returns if you can send a bit of cash over to help secure his inheritance, you should expect to not ever see a penny of that inheritance. My guess is that you take precautions, not because you don't want to be blamed, but because you aren't a dumbfuck that always expects the best from people."

I was only putting counterpoints to what you said here:   If the only concern about an action is that someone could commit a crime against you if you do it, there's no reason to blame anyone but the perpetrator.   I think my points perfectly demonstrated how retarded the above is. Also, If you think it occurs without incident, then I suppose none of your friends/coworkers have showed you pics (whether you really wanted to see them or not) that others have sent them, right? My coworkers sure as fuck have, and I'd venture to guess quite a few people here have been in the same position.    I'm sure you purchase goods online, and that to do so you use a credit card. You know there's a chance Newegg or Amazon or a small, online retailer could use your credit card to ruin your credit and bankrupt you. But my guess is you do it anyway because you're not a paranoid dumb fuck too paralyzed by his irrational fear of victimization that he doesn't enjoy himself.   No idea what Newegg is, but yes, I trust Amazon and my bank to safeguard my accounts, not so much smaller online retailers though. Then again, I have no idea why someone would compare institutions with policies and departments in place to make sure my information stays secure with a potential jilted ex-lover. If my debit information is stolen and used in a nefarious manner, I can cancel my card and resolve the issue with my bank and (sometimes) the retailer as well. Now, do you really think nude photos once uploaded and distributed across the internet behave in the same way? Of course not, no one can prevent someone from saving the photo indefinitely."

I understand your point is a pragmatic one, and that you're saying shit happens. Any time you use your credit card you run the risk of having your information stolen. Any time you eat food, you run the risk the person who prepared it spit in it. Do we tell people not to use a credit card or eat out? No. We tell people not to steal or spit in food.  Psychopaths will behave like psychopaths, surely. But the main complaint about victim blaming is there will be some heartbroken kid who wants his ex girlfriend or boyfriend to suffer as much as he or she does. They will think about all the pictures they saved on their phone, and they will excuse their behavior by saying ""This is his or her fault. He or she knew the risk. What I'm doing is acceptable."" The conversation should focus on deterring the person who is most morally culpable, the picture sharer, not the person who wanted to have a fun, sexy time with someone they liked.  BTW, I use the shtick because supposed grown ups use words like ""retarded"" to describe arguments. The shtick is my song of smug superiority."

Sure, if you looked around you could have avoided the accident, but this only resolves a problem of accident happening. Even if you didn't look around and just moved, you were still in the right - the person who runs into you is at fault.  With naked pics it's similar. You could have not sent them and avoid having them leaked, but even if you sent them it's not your fault they were leaked - the leaker is at fault. You can try to avoid the consequence, but not doing so doesn't make you guilty, as you had a full right to do it anyway and it's someone else who causes it."

Until there's a boycott against something the activists like. Then it's a witch-hunt.   Edit: to add, it feels like a lot of the vigor behind reactionary movements these days comes from frustration with the court of public opinion. For a long time, the general public was just not comfortable talking about discrimination. Now - within the space of 5 years - a bakery that refuses to serve same-sex couples can't just use ""religion"" to side-step accountability. You can't make disparaging comments about Hispanic Americans or immigrant communities and expect the public to be cool with it. It must be incredibly scary for these people to see the ground shift beneath their feet so quickly. It's not really about government policy or even corporate policies, its about the mainstream culture no longer accommodating or respecting people that defend discrimination anymore."

On the other hand, Romania, or more accurately the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were never fully incorporated in the Ottoman Empire, but were allowed to enjoy a large degree of self-rule.

So you are saying the current spouse abuse in USA is acceptable because a theocratic country is doing worse?  Difference is that we have the chance to change it in our secular American society more than in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I'd rather do what I can than just sit there and say ""oh they have it worse in XX country so it's acceptable"""
SubredditDrama,3dyqrl,takesteady1234,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"Christian abuse of women is not comparable to Muslim abuse of women?   Pretty much. Treatment of women in muslim dominated countries is not comparable at all to western or christian dominated ones. Why is this so controversial? It's a statement of fact.    We still don't give women the right to abortions in some areas of the country. We still have people who constantly attack women's rights.    Are you fucking serious?  This isn't about abortion in the south or redpillers/mras saying stuff on the internet. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills right now.  At least here in the US women have basic rights like being able to go to school without getting shot in the head, the right to vote, the ability to drive, not having your clitoris hacked off by the age of 13,  not getting stoned to death for infidelity, and many many more human rights abuses that I can't think of right now because I'm hung over. So no, the two are not comparable. Why are you so intent on justifying this behavior? How about just say 'oh wow that's fucked up and really should change' with no qualifiers.  You can do that without making less of feminist problems in the US.   edit: To answer your question, yeah it's fucking better"

SubredditDrama,3dyqrl,rudyrussoforsenate,0,Tue Jul 21 10:18:39 2015 UTC,Never said it was?   large minority of atheists and less religious people   So what you're trying to tell me is that a good chunk of the ~80% of Americans who identify as some form of Christians aren't the type who are mostly Christian on Christmas and Easter?  I think you and I are sorta arguing the same thing in a different manner though. A big part of why American women aren't as likely to have acid thrown in their face is because we're a far more secular nation than a lot of countries in the Middle East. So I think it's more secular vs fundamentalist than Christian vs Muslim.
SubredditDrama,3dyqrl,AWookieeFromKashyyyk,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:10 2015 UTC,Actually a large part of the opposition towards this is that the Romanian Government is funding it and giving away a huge portion of very valuable land in the capital city as part of a deal with the Turkish Government who will then send the state sponsored religion to run it for less than half a percent of the country who are Muslim at all nevermind the more radical/traditional Turkish sect. Another issue is the Turkish Government refusing to allow the Romanian Orthodox Church to set up anywhere in their country. The entire thing is a bit odd.

He has two bank accounts, a regular one and a savings account. His post was about how each account had been put into a negative £100,000 balance (or there abouts) meaning over both accounts he was down £200,000.  He said the bank have no idea what's going on and are struggling to resolve it. He and his partner have been going to the press and they have started writing about it.  Then this afternoon someone on /r/unitedkingdom realised the guy was the same person who hacked the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) and got details of thousands of women who used them for advice and to arrange abortions. BPAS was eventually fined £200k for data protection failures (the same amount the person involved has been put into debt). He failed to mention any of this history in his original thread and now people are turning against him and starting to believe it's more than a coincidence that his negative balance is the same as the fine placed on BPAS."

This amount was placed on each of his accounts, hence creating the -200g total, not pulled from one account in a lump sum.

As little as.5 percent THC is required for the user to feel high— depending, of course, on who the user is, the set and setting, and the amount he has smoked—but this would be very weak dope.   http://www.psychedelic-library.org/high_culture11.htm"

The laws are that you have to store people's data securely so it doesn't get into the hands of unauthorised people. In this case they did lose customers data to the hacker so they broke the law and should be fined.   Same goes with any company that handles people's data. 200k isn't much at all if a lot of data was assessed.

The only reason it usually spreads that much is because someone is too ashamed to go to the doctor.  There are two kinds: both treatments start with the removal of the ball. The first type then goes into radiation. The second type doesn't require radiation unless it recurs, as it is much less aggressive.

Not only are they redundant for availability's sake, they're also redundant in the sense that each operation is done by multiple CPUs and the results checked against each other to detect errors caused by cosmic radiation (seriously, bitflips). They have insane transaction throughput and very defined interfaces to the outside world. That last bit is actually the important part.

For all we know the police suspect him of actually selling some stolen information, but haven't gone public because the investigation is ongoing, but it could also be a mistake on the bank's part (playing it safe until they're told explicitly that the money in the account is legitimate).  A hacker doing something like this is pretty unlikely. Best case scenario they get some higher-up's password and access to the correct computer (this isn't something you can do over the internet), the bank would still catch such a drastic change to an account and flag it for review pretty quickly."

Absolutely repulsive. You disagree with a woman's right to choose-- or, to be specific, two choices that women actively made-- so you take deliberate steps to release sensitive information and put thousands and thousands of women in harm's way? What a terrible intersection of narcissism and misogyny. Women made choices that I DIDN'T LIKE, so FUCK THEM ALL!!! I'm going to see to it that they GET HURT!!! And he has the audacity to play the victim, to whinge about ""making mistakes.""  I wish I could see the fun in the rest of the drama, but this shit makes me sick.   My mum works as an OB/GYN; while she doesn't perform abortions, one of her colleagues does. Once, a few years ago, someone was able to hack the hospital information and get access to the personal emails of the entire OB/GYN team, sending dozens and dozens of messages about how they intended to ""take vengeance against the baby killers"" and ""destroy the whores"" who had been to the clinic.  They had to install a blast door with a closed-circuit camera to screen those getting into the abortion part of the clinic, hire security, improve transit conditions for those coming to the clinic, etc., etc. People get threatened, get attacked, get stalked, and occasionally get murdered by anti-abortion believers. And this is Canada, home of Morgentaler and absolutely no legal regulations against abortions.  Fuck, this is bullshit. I'm glad he went to jail and I'm impressed that people were able to work out his identity, but furious that people are still committing such heinous acts against the safety and security of women. 1 in 3 women will have an abortion at some point in her lifetime.

Yeah, because others found out why his bank accounts were in the red: he was a pro-lifer, and he hacked BPAS to further his political objectives. Now he's trying to get others to sympathize with the trainwreck of his own making. Not very bright."

SubredditDrama,3dupgr,ndrew452,146,Sun Jul 19 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"We're actually jumping the gun again. It could just be that the bank account problem is completely unrelated to the hacking incident, and that the similar monetary amounts are pure coincidence.  I'm starting to suspect that making assumptions based on vague information isn't the way to go."
SubredditDrama,3dupgr,ToxicPancakes,32,Sun Jul 19 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"Very true. I jumped to the conclusion that the 200k fine was related, but it probably isn't. OP would have gotten notice of proceeding, or at least a judgment, before they debited his account. And the bank would likely have know why the account was debited if it was to satisfy a judgment.   Either way, munch munch munch."
SubredditDrama,3dupgr,ndrew452,25,Sun Jul 19 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"If they suspected him of doing something like another hacking the 200k debt could be their attempts to freeze the account and investigate. This was actually brought up many times in the original thread (bank employee saying when they see this it's usually a means to freeze the account and keep the suspect from potentially ill gotten gains). I doubt he will be charged the 200k that the BPAS had to pay, that was a fine on them for not properly protecting the information of their patients. OP had to pay by going to jail.   So, basically, there is a chance they are related. Not in the ""pay what you owe!"" way but a ""we're suspicious of or keeping an eye on you,"" kind of way."

Some bank workers are explaining that this is a tactic used to freeze accounts. Why would his account be frozen? He's probably not telling us everything.   I ended up not retweeting and honestly forgot about this story until now.   Congrats, Reddit, you've made me into a cynical asshole- for the greater good."

It's gotten to the point where so many people think it makes them a special snowflake to have something ""wrong"" that they'll cling to anything, even a self diagnosis.   It makes it very annoying and difficult for people who actually suffer from the top tier of popular self diagnosis. I mean, if I had a dollar for everytime I was accused of faking depression and told I don't need pills, I'd be able to actually afford my shrink for an hour (huehuehue).   Basically this was a long and ranty way to say that yes, that was a red flag for me, but not a deal killer.   But you get it, right? Kind of sucks that we've been conditioned to distrust like this.

One girl wore what looked like nude colored leotards so it looked like she was naked possibly.   Girls standing and dancing. Girls in glass boxes wiggling around. Girls in mirrored boxes wiggling around.   Gradually the white color themes get more and more red. I'd assume something about losing virginity but it came across so much more like being about periods.   At one point a barbie doll has red paint pour on its head.   Then a bunch of shots that would make Georgia okeef proud. A purse being unzipped. Eyes and mouth close ups of them opening in vulva symbolism. Other items being opened in symbolic ways. Sexual stuff. But not sexy stuff.

SubredditDrama,3dymhe,canti28,11,Mon Jul 20 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"I'd be on the side that they have less say over their image. Due to the huge amount of kpop female groups, in order to stand out, sexy themes are on the rise for female groups. (A huge example is of EXID's Up and Down, in which a fancam of member Hani dancing the routine went viral last year, and EXID went from a no-namer to award show winner.)  Stella's label are hardly known in the industry, so again, the sexy image might be to get both Stella and the label well known."

SubredditDrama,3dymhe,krutopatkin,9,Mon Jul 20 20:03:33 2015 UTC,I think that can be said about any topic.  My buddy and I got in a big discussion in line for Ant-Man with the people behind us about the movie Man of Steel.  We hated it and the other guys loved it.  It was all good fun.

SubredditDrama,3dymhe,E-Rok,9,Mon Jul 20 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"But to an outsider these types of groups just seem like artificial, producer orchestrated acts, not like...actual musical groups.   That's what they are (with some noteworthy exceptions here and there). Kpop fans tend to enjoy the performance aspect, appreciate the production, inform themselves to a degree about how the sausage gets made (producers, composers and song writers are known by name, as are dance coreographers and some video directors) and enjoy following the rivalry between competing agencies. Furthermore, hiphop from Korea greatly overlaps with kpop on publicity channels (including /r/kpop) and fandom and sports remarkable genuine performer-songwriter talent, unlike strictly kpop.  Obviously sex and personality marketing are big components as well, and many kpop fans are certainly very young - the 20-something core demo on the sub is a bit older tho, and many there are also active followers of Korean band and indie artists.  Is any of it important? Not really - it's an entertainment-based hobby/diversion, and you can run into a broad variety of people (gender, ethnicity, age, occupation) in it, which is neat."

SubredditDrama,3dymhe,skooterr,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the video didn't seem that bad to me.  It reminds me of Hyuna's video for 'Red' and Rania's Dr. Feelgood video, which was much, much more explicit than this. Though the shot of a really close-up crotch at 1:20 was a bit startling.   If you want exploitative videos, I always find Hyomin's 'Nice Body' much worse. There is nothing redeemable about the song or the lyrics. Same with 'Up&Down' by EXID. Honestly, given how sexual all kpop is, I don't really see how you can complain about this."
SubredditDrama,3dymhe,spacecanucks,5,Tue Jul 21 00:55:31 2015 UTC,I think it's weird to complain about it anyway. Kpop is not even close to the only genre of music that is sexualized. I'd argue the likes of Lady Gaga or Nikki Minaj are much worse.

It doesn't need to be a diagnosis she was suspecting, it just needs to be a good explanation. This is why one of her kids had glasses at 1 year old. You can barely find glasses that small anywhere.

The person giving her advice gives absolutely no information on exactly what those doctors did that resulted in them continuously searching for a new doctor.  That's great that they found help, but OP is explaining that all of the doctors she went to spent thousands of dollars attempting to solve her problem.  They didn't just blow OP off like the 'advice givers' lazy doctors apparently did.  She has a point.  These doctors tried to help her, and the people criticizing her in that thread are ignoring that fact.  The answer isn't always, ""keep trying"".

Dan Schneider, the main writer and producer for Nickelodeon shows, has been identified as one of the central organizers of the Pedowood scandal, he may also draw his genetic ancestry from the Line of Blood so you know hes a bad guy.  Dan Schneider has used his position at Nickelodeon to implant subliminal messages within the shows he creates in order to sexualize young children, this includes placing foot fetish scenes within iCarly.  At some point the Line of Blood made a deal with Stalinist cultural-Marxist sleeper-cells, AKA: SJWs, to launch the final offensive against the white race. The final offensive was to take the form of Nickelodeon hiring a man by the name of ""Jonathan Butler"" to co-produce a show named ""Bella and the Bulldogs"".  Jonathan Butler, before coming to work at Nickelodeon, produced a movie called ""The Cuckold"" which is about race play cuckold fetishes. Bella and the Bulldogs contains obvious Cuckold iconography and subliminal messaging in the form of a white girl being friends with a black boy and a white boy at the same time.

From what I understand is the black kid is the strong many type and the white kid not so much and stuck in the friend zone as she chooses the black kid.  So since cuckolding is obviously a black man having sex with a white woman instead of the white man it's horrible garbage. Because God forbid a white girl ever have a relationship with a black boy.  You can see issues with this in Hollywood as well. I for the life of me cannot think of a movie where the love interest for the black actor is a white actress.

Some relevant bits from ""What This Cruel War Was Over"":   The loss of slavery would call white men's right to rule over blacks into question, and once right to rule in any sphere was weakened, it's legitimacy became suspect in every sphere.      Without slavery, the Enquirer warned, the daughters of honest white yeomen would be helpless against the sexual advances of black men. Soldiers frequently and emphatically echoed this theme. One Georgia recruit fretted about rumors that slaves who thought the war meant freedom were already discussing ""whom they would make their wives among the young [white] ladies.""      By depriving white southern men of the rights and privileges due to the white male head of household,  abolition would leave white southern men powerless, propertyless, and degraded in real, not simply symbolic, senses.      Unmarried as well as married white men had the duty to protect and right to control white women's bodies and morals . . . Men who failed to provide such protection did not deserve the love of a woman, another key hallmark of true manhood. Other indicators if white manhood included personal mobility and the right to bear arms."

SubredditDrama,3dymfo,jodics,15,Mon Jul 20 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah and no.  There are cases when people just play up the stereotypes of another culture to use that ""exotic mystique"" as a gimmick accessory.  Then there are decades long collaborative enterprises between people of varying backgrounds.  For example, a lot of Jazz is the fusion of African rhythms brought over by slaves, and white instrumentation and melodic sensibilities.  Something like a quarter of Jazz standards are contrafacts of Gershwin's I got rhythm, for example.  But even in cases like those, the dominant culture can overshadow those in the subculture through mainstream attention.  Brubeck was embarassed by the fact that he was featured on the cover of Time magazine instead of Duke Ellington, a fact that Brubeck attributes to his whiteness.  When this happens, it can produce a diluting effect where people from the dominant culture (Brubeck, Evans, etc.) can have more influence over the genre than a similarly skilled black musician more engaged in their  musical tradition (soul, blues, spirituals)  would."
SubredditDrama,3dymfo,FeloniousMonk94,5,Mon Jul 20 22:36:38 2015 UTC,"Not only Jazz. Blues has it roots in African music as well which then was turned into RnB and from that we got rock and roll.   The idea that only the ""original"" culture are allowed their culture is strange. Culture have been mixed for as long as there have been cultures to mix. The only somewhat reasonable argument against appropriation is that it makes fun of the original but that feels a bit like a straw man to me. Being racist/bigoted/a dick is never cool, no matter the context. So banning all forms of cultural cross-pollination to stop some people being racist makes little sense."
SubredditDrama,3dymfo,Zotamedu,6,Tue Jul 21 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting anything like banning.  What I am saying is that when the majority can shape the incentives for what music gets produced, they can dilute whatever it is that makes the original fusion special.  I didn't mention blues, because that really is a black dominated genre with few if any white innovators.  Players like SRV and Clapton are skilled, to be sure, but they didn't have a substantial influence on the genre as a whole as Gershwin, Porter and others had an influence on jazz.  What I do think is that popular attention (i.e mass appeal among people who happen to be white) can have a pernicious effect in diluting that artform to be more palatable for the masses, in this particular case, white masses.    Of course, there's nothing wrong with a white person listening to or playing black music, but I think there is something wrong with white musicians having huge advantages in visibility when their more daring but less white contemporaries are still out of the limelight.  This will have industry effects in incentivising more popular and less ""alien"" or ""exotic"" music being produced."
SubredditDrama,3dymfo,FeloniousMonk94,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I was unclear, I never meant to imply that you wanted it banned, it was aimed to the people who argue that appropriation is the worst thing ever.   It's true that few white people have done anything important in blues but the link to RnB and Rock&Roll is quite important. A lot of our western music has it's roots in a combination of European ""classical"" music mixed with African rhythms. Just check who the great musicians of rock have been influenced by. Jimmy Page has a long list of blues guitarists including B.B. King as influences. Page himself tends to be high on the list of more modern artists. Even the whitest musical genre in the world, country music"" has roots in blues.   That sounds like a bit of a oversimplification to me. It can work the other way around as well. Other cultures getting air time in the media can spark an increased interest in the ""original"". Also, would an unknown eastern artist ever have a chance in the west without ""appropriation""? Are you actually removing anything from the system?  Lets have a look at a related subject. Did Skrillex destroy years of dubstep when he dumped his old screamo band to start a dubstep or ""brostep"" revolution? Did a decade of dubstep all of a sudden become bad? I know I listened to some early dubstep after Skrillex and I would never have known it existed otherwise. Quite a few of the old fans were salty but now more people know of the genre and how it was around the turn of the millennium.   How many black blues musicians did not get famous because of Clapton? How many white people got into blues as a genre thanks to Clapton?"
SubredditDrama,3dymfo,Zotamedu,3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"That is a really good explanation, thank you"
SubredditDrama,3dymfo,jodics,10,Tue Jul 21 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"No problem, and I'm thankful that you didn't dismiss the idea out of hand.  The problem is that there are people on both sides that selectively lose their ability to interpret nuance when it comes to things like this.  Some say whenever a white person engages in an cultural activity that is mainly associated with or originated from people who identify with a different culture, that white person is always engaging in cultural appropriation and is being destructive.  I think this is plainly incorrect.  There have been white innovators in cultural enterprises with many black people, for example, in Jazz, Blues, Hip Hop, Fusion and so on.  But it might be that white musicians in these genres get undue attention and the art form gets watered down.    And it even changes the financial incentives for the music industry as a whole-  the ""pop-ified"" bands with mass appeal are more likely to get signed and promoted due to market demands."

SubredditDrama,3dvplz,whitesock,16,Mon Jul 20 02:04:07 2015 UTC,Can someone explain this to a non-CK player (or someone whose head the joke went over)?
SubredditDrama,3dvplz,PlayMp1,56,Mon Jul 20 05:32:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! I play CKII.  ""Crown authority"" is a mechanic in CKII that determines how powerful the king in his realm vs how many privileges the lower nobility has. On low crown authority, the king needs to ask permission from his direct vassals (meaning, not the vassals of his vassals) before he can call them to war. On higher crown authority, he doesn't need to and they automatically give him control of their units. On low crown authority, vassals can wage war against eachother while on higher crown authority they cannot.   Crown authority can get higher on lower if the king asks his vassals and they put it into a vote. Sometimes having higher crown authority can be good for a vassal because that means, for example, that he can change inheritance laws from gavelkind (my lands are split between heirs) to primogeniture (my eldest gets everything). So playing the game is all about balancing this.  A faction is something vassals can start when they want to make their liege do something. You can start a faction for independence, for lowering crown authority, changing crown laws or putting someone else on the throne. When enough people join a faction, the faction leader can give the liege an ultimatum to do what he says or face a rebellion. One of the more common factions are for lowering crown authority.  So the title is basically a fancy way of saying ""this guy is pissed about the mods and wants other people to join him""."
SubredditDrama,3dvplz,whitesock,23,Mon Jul 20 05:53:08 2015 UTC,"On low crown authority, the king needs to ask permission from his direct vassals   That is definitely not the case, at least in vanilla + all expansions playing a feudal character (i.e., not nomadic or tribal). More crown authority gives you a higher minimum levy instead, so their opinion of you matters less. So, for example, at medium crown authority, you get +40% minimum levy from all direct vassals (feudal, church, republic, doesn't matter).   This means that no matter what, they have to give you at least 40% of their possible liege levy to you despite what they think of your character, so characters at -100 opinion will just give the 40%, and characters at +100 opinion will give you the 40% plus whatever amount your Feudal Levies demesne law sets as the maximum levy (80% is the default, 100% is pretty easy to use though). So if you have 100% maximum levies and 40% minimum, you'll get somewhere between 40 and 100% of your potential vassal levies.   Levies, by the way, are soldiers!  It also gives you access to the Seniority succession law (oldest dynasty member inherits) and gives you the ability to revoke infidel/heretic titles for free (so if somehow you gain control of a Muslim duke and you're a Catholic, you can revoke his titles without your other vassals caring), and disables internal wars, so your vassals stop fighting each other over stupid shit.  At max/absolute crown authority, you get +80% minimum levy, but your vassals hate you because you're nearly an all powerful absolute monarch. However, if you're good enough at the diplomatic maneuvering and such, you can maintain this and keep an extremely large army, which makes it less likely for factions to actually declare their rebellion. On the downside, your vassals can no longer wage war period, including on other realms, so you'll never see one of your vassals expand your realm through one of their own wars (I once gained all of Scotland while playing Reformed Germanic Scandinavian empire without putting in an ounce of effort because one of my vassals declared a prepared invasion).   Usually most people try to get to High crown authority because that gives you access to primogeniture (eldest inherits), and it doesn't have the downsides of Absolute authority (vassals hating you and vassals can't declare any wars). You also get +60% minimum levy, which is enough to handle most things. Also popular is Medium authority with Elective Monarchy for the succession - get diplomatic characters and nominate your favorite dynasty member and persuade everyone else to vote for them. Or even better: make sure your entire realm, vassals and all, is from your dynasty!  I've done all of these, but my personal favorite is playing as a republic so I can make that dolla-dolla bill y'all, pick whoever I want as my heir, and field hilarious amounts of mercs.  Edit: Oh yeah, and once you're an empire, you do want absolute crown authority so you can enact Imperial Administration and get +25 to your vassal limit and free duchy revocation. 25 higher vassal limit is ridiculously useful, as it lets you keep your vassals smaller and therefore weaker, especially if you also want a more centralized realm (i.e., you own more provinces directly, making you stronger, while having a smaller vassal limit) or you want to have kingdom or duchy viceroyalties (viceroyalties = king and ducal titles that revert to the liege when the holder dies, allowing you to pick whoever you want to become the next king/duke)."

SubredditDrama,3dvplz,ttumblrbots,10,Mon Jul 20 10:05:41 2015 UTC,"To explain the linked comment itself:  Jewish courtiers will sometimes show up in your character's court, and they often have great skills in diplomacy or stewardship due to their time spent abroad or serving in other courts, so it's often to your advantage to make use of them and treat them well*.  You can also borrow 300 gold from rich Jewish merchants, though this makes temple vassals (bishops, etc.) dislike you until you pay the loan back (with 50 gold of interest). I guess it's a ""no usury"" thing.  Alternately, you can expel Jews from your realm, rounding them up and seizing 200 gold from them before having them make an exodus elsewhere. This carries some serious consequences: you'll suffer a minor diplomacy penalty, skilled Jewish courtiers will no longer arrive at your court, and since Jews are important to the cultural, economic, and military progress of your society, you'll occasionally suffer technology penalties due to their absence. However, if you owe Jewish merchants money and then expel them, you don't owe them money anymore. They can be welcomed back in twenty years' time or a generation later, whichever comes first.  This gives rise to a common strategy, especially early in the game: borrow money from the Jews, then expel them for an easy 500 gold in total at the cost of a minor diplomacy and technology penalty (which doesn't hurt you all that much, especially early when you have few or no vassals and your technology progress is terrible anyway).  Pretty vile, really, but somewhat historically accurate, and in a game rife with the potential for murder, betrayal, infanticide, filicide, incest, religious discrimination, political mutilation (if you play in the Byzantine Empire), and even options like ""take concubine"" and ""settle tribe"" (euphemisms for sex slavery and genocide, respectively), it fits.  tl;dr: The whole thing is (partially) a joke about the Jews in the game.  *Just don't make one your spymaster––he'll hate you for being an infidel, so he'll be very willing to plot against you, and if someone gets your spymaster in on a plot to murder you, you're as good as dead."

""I may be boring, ignorant and illiterate, but thank God I'm not black!""  It's also a kind of transference of responsibility and way to assume control. There's this pervasive idea that we are the masters of our own reality, you're poor? Work harder! You're fat? Work out more! You get hassled by the cops? Don't commit any crime! Pretty soon you begin to figure out that some of these issues are waaaay outside of your control, systemic poverty hurts for generations, getting hassled by cops usually comes with the territory if you're a minority etc."

Strawman: your perfectly accurate description of my position makes it sound silly, therefore your argument is wrong.   False equivalence: the two things you compare aren't identical in every way so I'm going to ignore the relevant shared characteristics in order to dismiss your argument based on an unimportant detail.  Slippery slope: there are no bounds to my paranoia and wild speculation, therefore no action can ever be taken for fear of the consequences - unless it supports my goal, then appealing to the consequences is a fallacy (see below).  Appeal to consequences: Saying my actions will lead to negative outcomes is illogical (see above).  Fallacy fallacy: A stupid trick people try to use to tell me to stop throwing out fallacies in hopes that one will stick when they realise I've beaten them in debate.   Edited to add some more:  No True Scotsman: your dissenting from my inaccurate or misleading characterisation of a position or group is simply an attempt to disassociate yourself from the self-serving caricature I have assembled.

SubredditDrama,3dvplz,dontmovetoportland,23,Mon Jul 20 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"There's a good comment by Daniel Dennett as he replies to Sam Harris' views on free will where he gives his advice for laymen who try to dismiss the conclusions of experts:   I would hope that Harris would pause at this point to wonder—just wonder—whether maybe his philosophical colleagues had seen some points that had somehow escaped him in his canvassing of compatibilism.  As I tell my undergraduate students, whenever they encounter in their required reading a claim or argument that seems just plain stupid, they should probably double check to make sure they are not misreading the “preposterous” passage in question. It is possible that they have uncovered a howling error that has somehow gone unnoticed by the profession for generations, but not very likely.  In this instance, the chances that Harris has underestimated and misinterpreted compatibilism seem particularly good, since the points he defends later in the book agree right down the line with compatibilism; he himself is a compatibilist in everything but name!   [My bold].  The most frustrating thing about most of these fallacies is that if you only quickly skim the opening line of the wiki article you get the mistaken impression that they're always fallacious and always wrong.   But if I appeal to a valid, relevant authority who is stating the field's consensus position - then that is considered great evidence. It's not fallacious at all. If I say my friend is a dentist and he doesn't believe evolution is true, then there's a fallacy there (with the important part in a discussion being where you explain why and how it leads to a faulty conclusion, not just namedrop and give the definition of a fallacy)."

It's a right, and, in general, people should avoid infringing the rights of others except when those rights conflict with other rights. But banning people from a forum doesn't infringe on their freedom of speech, because the forum is privately hosted, and they're welcome to host their own speech themselves if they so choose. No one would be surprised if the Democratic party was hosting a forum for discussing Democratic party strategies and issues, and removed content that was critical of them or counter to their message. Does Reddit suddenly have an additional moral obligation just because they don't have a specific political affiliation?"

Reddit is also a business, and they are doing what they think is the best thing to do when it comes to enticing advertisers.   Reddit is a large, and still growing, community. I bet the creators had no idea that it would ever get this big. When it comes to steering a community like Reddit, you learn as you go. Especially after major dramas like r/jailbait and the Fappening, which cast Reddit in a bad light. This is why I think that FPH was banned: it was getting a LOT of attention both on and off Reddit, and it did not look good for Reddit.  We may not agree with their actions. For example: I think the admins should nuke r/coontown from orbit, but I continue to use Reddit because I agree with most of the things that the admins do, and I like the Reddit community because of it."

Garden-variety American liberals think that reddit is flooded with naive high school libertarians (/r/EnoughLibertarianSpam).  People further to the left (like people you might find in /r/shitliberalssay) seem to agree that reddit is overrun with brogressives who are basically posers pretending they're lefties.  KiA-ers think that reddit has been literally infiltrated by touchy-feely hugbox tumblr people.  SRS and SRD and other social-issue lefties tend to believe that there's an disturbing undercurrent of far-right reactionism in the defaults.  In short, everybody tends to think their greatest enemy is the one in control.  At the very least, metasphere subreddits are always out to highlight their greatest enemies being obnoxious in big default threads.  So, to apply this theory to /r/shitliberalssay, they think of themselves as far-left egalitarians who want to bring prosperity to all through socialism.  The sub was set up to mock boring, tepid American liberalism, so naturally, their greatest enemy is boring, tepid American liberals.  But since the far-lefties also believe deeply in equality across race, sex, and gender, they're especially opposed to the American liberal who says racist and/or sexist and/or transphobic shit.  How prevalent is this breed of liberal?  It's hard to say, really.  But you can imagine, at least, that it's easy for places like /r/shitliberalssay to think they're everywhere."

We also found out afterwards that mom and dad (who were seperated) had also banned that show until they were older.   I felt like my parents for a second until i downloaded a season of the simpsons and they found it hilarious! their humour hits on so many goddamn levels.   We also woke up one morning to see what kids watch on TV on Saturday Mornings... there are sadly no more cartoons for these fucking kids anymore to let their imagination run wild.

Now let me ask you this, would you rather be falsely accused of rape and convicted, spending years of your life in prison (where there is a very high chance that you will be raped yourself) for a crime you didn't commit and a fucking lifetime of being stigmatized as an all around terrible human being or raped one time?"

Having been raped before,and considering how few rapists actually get convicted, i'll take my chances at trial.    I wasn't trying to attack you, but you have to realize that many many many people, especially on reddit, truly believe that false rape accusations are 1) worse than rape and 2) more prevalent than rape and 3) that people who falsely accuse people of rape should be imprisoned as if they committed a rape."

Falsely accusing someone of rape is a terrible thing. It should most definitely be punished as a crime. People who do this aren't just hurting the lives of people they falsely accuse, they're hurting the chances of actual rape victims to be taken seriously. It's a really, truly disgusting thing to do to someone, in my opinion. I'd say it's pretty much on par with being a rapist. If it's not on the same level of rape, it's like maybe two notches down."

During this time transgender activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson who briefly ran a transgender outreach program called S.T.A.R (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) identified as drag queens and tranvestites:   ""Gay Pride organisers tried to ban transvestites from the parade in 1978 because after all, you turn on TV and there was a gay pride parade and all they show is the drag queens. So what Sylvia & Marsha did, is they went ahead of the opening banner as two transvestites with some friends, they marched in front of the parade so it made them end up leading the whole parade! So the committee decided 'well, we've gotta start including transvestites in our parade'"" - Randolfe Wicker, Human Rights Activist   ""She would talk about how there was nobody to represent her and her rights as a transvestite, 'cause they had all these gay men and all these gay women working at the gay center, but they had no transvestites.

They are some of the most intolerant, hateful and intransigent fringe by far.   Was this person ever really one to begin with? It's really really weird and fucked up to me whenever I see this ""you've lost a powerful ally"" talk. Because the point of being an ally is literally being open the concerns and needs of a marginalized community even if they some times conflict with your own interests. You don't have to agree with every single thing said by every single member of that group. Just be aware and be open to listening to them about it and don't act like said group needs to cater to your every whim to earn your acceptance of their existence.  But I keep seeing more and more people who talk about being an ally like it's a bargaining chip with regards to these groups. In my own experience I've seen it where cis heterosexual people try to claim they deserve a spot in the LGBTQA banner because of their support and if someone disagrees they'll talk about losing respect or faith in the GSM community because they feel excluded and that because of that one thing they'll be less likely to support the community as a whole.

SubredditDrama,3dxebn,murexmuris,7,Mon Jul 20 09:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's depressing how many people took this as an opportunity to have an anti-trans circlejerk. One pride parade decided not to have drag performances, so obviously all trans people are toxic and hateful! At least the community downvoted them."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,Dain42,7,Mon Jul 20 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"I generally like /r/ainbow, but (just like /r/gaymers and especially /r/gaybros) there is this stupid undercurrent of what would probably currently be characterized as ""anti-SJW"" sentiment and anti-trans sentiment.  I get that some of that is because of the whole /r/LGBT dramapocalypse a few years ago, but gosh is it annoying to find dickbags like that in an LGBT group. I mean, gay people have been the beneficiaries of so much social justice activism that it's almost offensive to hear gay kids like some these ones taking up the language of the opposition to their own equality.  EDIT: At least most of the worst shit is getting downvoted. But not all of it. sigh  Most of the people on the subs I mentioned are decent and nice. But a couple turds steaming on the lawn really do spoil your enjoyment of it a bit. You have to be careful where you tread, at the least."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,murexmuris,4,Mon Jul 20 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can actually understand the anti-SJW backlash to some extent, don't support it but when you've been exposed to some of the more extreme corners of internet social justice it can be easy to develop that attitude. But that doesn't mean you can just call all behavior you disagree with ""toxic"" and hurtful. I've seen LGBT (including trans) people acting toxic to one another; that parade banning drag is not an example, no matter how much people disagree with it. /soapbox"
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,Dain42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can actually understand the anti-SJW backlash to some extent,   Honestly, I have trouble understanding it at all. Sure, there are always people who take things too far. And there always will be. But the kind of wave of anger and recriminations against even mainstream social justice concepts and movements is outright absurd in light of the fact that the hyper-offended few tend to be the edgiest of edge cases (pun intended, if you don't mind).  At this point, I think the backlash is louder, more organized, and more prominent than the so-called ""Social Justice Warrior""* class ever was. Which is a pretty deep irony, if you ask me.  I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, I suppose. I do try to understand things from other perspectives, generally, and I can understand how it could be annoying to run into a particular hyper-offended person, rare as they may be. But this particular perspective that we're talking about has basically exceeded my capacity for empathy at this point.    * Whatever that means at this point. Basically nothing, in my opinion, the way it gets bandied about and tossed at anyone who even tries to say, ""Why don't we try being nice?"""
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,murexmuris,2,Tue Jul 21 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"Nah you can disagree with me. I don't understand, or at least don't excuse, the more organized movement against social justice. I meant more that I could understand people's frustration with extreme SJW stuff."

SubredditDrama,3dxebn,zxcv1992,3,Mon Jul 20 09:29:56 2015 UTC,What did the deleted comment say ?
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,nekosune,6,Mon Jul 20 09:38:32 2015 UTC,"TBH I only have a vague memory myself, but it was about how no one in /r/ainbow wants them and how they should get out of the subreddit, with more colourful language"
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,GobtheCyberPunk,-4,Mon Jul 20 09:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well of course rainbow sides with the drag queens - it doesn't matter if the (often deliberate by Queens like RuPaul) conflation of trans identities and drag is a huge part of the community at this point. What's more important than ending transphobic social perceptions is their self-expression of course. Doesn't matter if many drag performers use words that have been used as slurs against trans people as part of their performance, or deliberately go out of their way to make sure cishet people conflate them with trans identities. No, if an unaware cishet person conflates the two, that's obviously their problem. And there's absolutely no obligation to help trans people by educating the difference, since drag performers are more common than trans people, because again, that's not their problem. Don't want to make cis LGB people too uncomfortable in the movement, now.  I don't think drag should be banned at all, but at least in terms of pride parades which are explicitly about the identities of GSM people (and no, no matter how hard you try, self-expression is not on that fundamental of a level), the movement should dissociate drag from them until the drag community has adequately addressed its transphobic elements. I believe in the right of artistic self-expression, but the respect of fundamental identities, especially those which are so marginalized and oppressed, is more important.  I guarantee there will be many angry rainbow denizens who will argue with me, but since that subreddit was founded by frozen peach warriors of course there's instant hostility to the idea of any social obligation whatsoever."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,DblackRabbit,21,Mon Jul 20 11:05:58 2015 UTC,"No, if an unaware cishet person conflates the two, that's obviously their problem.   Well yes, it is. You can't tell someone to stop being themselves because bigots people do shit. I don't smack watermelon out of other black people's hands."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,KlokWerkN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"I was rather vocal in that thread and I think a lot of /r/ainbow people were trying to take what I was saying and turning it into a ""ban Drag because of my feels"" sort of message. I was just trying to say that a lot of times people try to make drag out to be this great thing for the trans community when really it's not. Do I have a problem with drag? No, and many trans people would agree. We all started with trying to express our femininity (or masculinity for trans men) and find what made us feel comfortable. However I feel like the message often with drag is ""Being feminine/masculine vs what my gender dictates is okay because this is drag"" instead of it just being... gender bending. I don't know I'm sure this doesn't make sense but I feel like people use the title of drag as an excuse to hide behind instead of just presenting feminine or masculine. Before I transitioned and really came out as trans I was just a feminine gay guy that wore mostly feminine clothing, but never felt the need to explain away what I was doing to hide behind a title.  Which leads to my kind of TLDR: A lot of people mix trans and drag but I don't feel like the drag community does enough to say ""hey this is all about how gender roles are dumb and it's okay to be feminine/masculine"" instead of ""hey look a guy in a dress""!"
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,DblackRabbit,14,Mon Jul 20 16:00:50 2015 UTC,The idea that the drag community has to be the one make the distinction because other people mix them is leading to respectability politics.
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,KlokWerkN,9,Mon Jul 20 16:21:06 2015 UTC,But when they like to constantly throw out slurs like tranny and shemale all the time it doesn't do much benefit to trans people who are on the reciving end of those words :/
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,DblackRabbit,9,Mon Jul 20 16:24:08 2015 UTC,am I suppose to stop saying the n-word because racist people say it?
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,KlokWerkN,3,Mon Jul 20 16:30:03 2015 UTC,But why use it at all?
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,DblackRabbit,9,Mon Jul 20 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Because its our word, I can use it because its mine now, I'm not going to change my life because others use it as justification to be assholes, because me changing isn't going to change their minds, it just me giving things up in vain."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,KlokWerkN,5,Mon Jul 20 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a trans person, I guess using similar context tranny and shemale are mine to use. However as a member of that population that they are targeted towards I don't particularly like being referred to as such. The only person who can determine if a slur is offensive or not is really the person who is being targeted by it, to me personally I think it's offensive and has too many negative connotations so I don't use it and frown upon it's use. Can I determine what is offensive for other people in other groups? No, however I just avoid slurs since I don't see a point."
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,DblackRabbit,6,Mon Jul 20 16:38:35 2015 UTC,Are transvestites and Drag Queens not called slurs also? Are the drag queen referring to you as such are other drag queens?
SubredditDrama,3dxebn,ltg313,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"No, because you're black. Drag queens using those slurs is much more like white people using the N-word."

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,amartz,95,Mon Jul 20 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Because it's not for the one year old. No logical person looks at this and thinks the parents literally bought this cake as a gift for a one year old.   This amazingly patient explanation is, of course, promptly rejected.  Debunked using anecdotal evidence, even."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,superslab,54,Mon Jul 20 05:13:04 2015 UTC,"We spent ~$75 on the cake for our one-year old because a bakery near our house makes awesome tasting cake and we don't have many excuses to get one.  If I'm going to spend a day chasing toddlers in the park, I damn well want some awesome cake at the end.    The kid will probably want cheap sugary crap as soon as he has opinions."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,Pollux10,16,Mon Jul 20 12:10:11 2015 UTC,"It's been shown in studies that a small child literally has no limit on the amount of sugar they will willingly consume. I think it's about 8 yrs old or so when their taste buds begin moving beyond ""all the sugar all the time"". Just something to keep in mind, something that tastes good to you may simply be too bland to a small child, which is why they tend to prefer the ""cheap sugary crap""."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,Defenestratio,7,Mon Jul 20 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"I thought it was the other way around, that taste buds lose their ""strength"" as you age, and that's why kids like plain things, but grow to like food with more spices and flavors."

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,kurin,12,Mon Jul 20 15:14:22 2015 UTC,I'm sure your Steam collection looks like a silly waste to a lot of people.   Someone actually brings up the fact that the dude who's getting all huffy about the cake has spent hundreds of dollars on an Xbox One and games for it. He then insists that an Xbox is an investment but a cake is not.
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,Mr_Tulip,7,Mon Jul 20 20:03:02 2015 UTC,Okay so a cake is clearly not an investment but in what world is an xbox one an investment? An investment is something you can expect to make money off of. Does he expect to make it as a pro gamer or something? I'm sure the answer is infuriatingly stupid either way.

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,bombadilsboots,16,Mon Jul 20 07:39:25 2015 UTC,I like how people are like saying how the one year old won't remember it. As though the mom doesn't already know that. It's more about the get together.   The funny thing is that $100 wasn't even enough to pull off a two tier cake of that quality. Making their argument that they spent too much money even more stupid.
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,SweetLenore,5,Mon Jul 20 10:11:51 2015 UTC,SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET SPENT MONEY ON SOMETHING I DIDN'T PERSONALLY APPROVE OF.   I better voice my opinion of their waste of money on my device that cost even more that I use to waste time on reddit!

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,Defenestratio,6,Mon Jul 20 07:31:53 2015 UTC,My brother and I share a birthday. Normally we have separate birthday parties but one year we had a huge combined party and a shared cake that was ~$150 because it had to be huge and feed a fuckton of people.
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,KiraKira_,10,Mon Jul 20 12:55:38 2015 UTC,"Is it common to spend that much on birthday cakes?  If someone's got the money for it, I think it's great if they want to splurge on something pretty or unique,  but I only ever got those Wal-Mart sheet cakes, which are like $30 or so."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,SweetLenore,11,Mon Jul 20 05:45:56 2015 UTC,Walmart cakes aren't exactly the highest quality and are generally garbage. So of course it's going to be cheaper at Walmart. That's kind of what society has come to. People think everything should be dirt cheap and don't understand the amount of time put into a cake like the one pictured.
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,Sarandana,3,Mon Jul 20 10:14:00 2015 UTC,"Publix cakes are the shit. They're my family's go-to cake for birthdays and special events.  Actually, anything from their bakery section is delicious. Especially their cannolis and the buttercream frosting they use on their cakes. Just one of the many reasons why Publix is the superior grocery store."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,mynameisevan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:45 2015 UTC,I've always heard that when you buy an expensive cake what you're really buying is the decoration and the actual cake probably comes out of a box of cake mix you could get at any grocery store.

I don't see how this is so extreme to people. It's a cake for something that comes once a year. It's not that insane if that's what you are into.   I mean, it's within the realm of reality for a middle class family to spend a large amount of money on a nice cake once in a while. I don't understand why everyone is so baffled. There's plenty of things that cost $100 that I wouldn't want to spend my money on but at the same I can understand how someone else might be into something I'm not."

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,empathogen75,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"Because you don't seem to understand that spending $100 on a cake is an extravagant expense for people that don't make very much money.  They think that a walmart cake is perfectly fine.  Hell, they might SPLURGE on a cake from walmart, because ordinarily they'd just make it themselves.   I'm what I would call upper-middle class now.  I saved up and spent $800 on a dinner for two a few weeks ago, so I get that good food is worth paying for if you have money.  But I grew up poor -- my parents put clothes on layaway at kmart, and some weeks barely had enough money to feed all of us.  I've been to places in Guatemala and Mexico where a family of four might live off of $100 a month or even less.  I've had a friend that was homeless and lived off of nothing but ramen and bread for 4 months.      If you don't have money, then just having something in your belly is good enough.  The idea that someone might spend $100 on a cake when they could make one at home for $10 sounds obscene when you're broke.  I'm not objecting to you spending your money how you want, I'm mostly objecting to the idea that someone thinking that this is an extravagant expense is evidence of some kind of decline in society.  Some people just don't have very much money, and for them it is an extravagant expense."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,nkots,10,Mon Jul 20 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"Cakes are expensive. People who make them put a lot of work into them. If you think spending $100 for a quality product that took hours of work is insane, then you don't buy it. I think spending $60,000 on a car is insane, but I understand why people do. They appreciate the craftsmanship and quality of the more expensive car. A $60,000 car, like a $100 cake, is not an extravagant expense. That's what you pay to get the product you want. I just happen to not be able to afford it.   It's one thing to not be able to afford something, like me not being able to afford a more expensive car or the guy in the post not being able to afford a $100 cake. But to act like it's a ""crazy expense"" just shows that people don't understand that if you want something good you have to pay money for it."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,empathogen75,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:06:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, a quality cake is worth $100.  The question is whether buying a quality cake for a 1 year old's birthday party is an extravagant expense.  I think it's absurd, personally."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,SweetLenore,7,Mon Jul 20 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly objecting to the idea that someone thinking that this is an extravagant expense is evidence of some kind of decline in society.   It does show a decline in society and the way people view skilled work and quality products. Part of the Walmart culture is that everything should be so incredibly cheap that you literally have to use sweatshops from foreign countries to make it as cheap as people want. People see a shitty cake at Walmart and think that's on the same level as the one pictured and don't even know that just looking at the ingredients will give you a view on why it's cheaper and why you maybe shouldn't be eating it.  Many people seem to have a very immature view on the world where products just appear out of thin air. And part of the reason many americans have that view is because we've been led to believe that buying a set of plates for $5 and a bundle of towels for $3.99 is normal. Then create a culture where when a normal price shows up people balk at it likes it's such a ripoff and ridiculous and they are smarter and better cause they go to Walmart. They don't even consider why things there (from towels to cakes) might be so incredibly cheap.  Various people from the poor, the middle class and the upper middle class all have this problem. And it shows a lack of understanding on what products actually cost to make and what labor is worth. Yeah, it shows a decline in society.   Not being able to afford a $100 cake is fine. But going ""lawl, Walmart's cake are like $30"" shows exactly what I mean."

At Walmart, all the overhead, electricity, etc is taken care of by corporate. Walmart's cakes show up at the store, frozen from some central bakery. A minimum wage employee squirts on some frosting from an industrial-sized tub and the 'decorator' (who might make $10/hr)  might fancy it up a bit.  A private bakery in my area charges $35/tier and then a bit more for fancy decoration...that cake (ETA- the Pinterest one.) would easily be $100. The private baker has to pay her rent and electricity, buy supplies, bake the damn cake, spend hours decorating it and still try to turn a profit.  Trying to compare the two is ridiculous."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,techtechvpi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair if you are paid minimum, are struggling to get by, or are raised by people who have been through that, pushing for better deals is going to be a necessary byproduct. It doesn't necessarily mean there's less appreciation for quality if you go for the Walmart cake or say that about it. Though I do agree a lot of people will skip out on a superior product even when it's just a bit more expensive with only the deal in mind."
SubredditDrama,3dwo81,HawkCawCaw,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:17 2015 UTC,"$100 really isn't a huge deal for a custom birthday cake.

SubredditDrama,3dwo81,empathogen75,0,Mon Jul 20 16:16:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't consider anyone that thinks $100 is a meaningful amount of money to be upper-middle class.

Because it assumes that all men are born rapists, thus you need to teach them not to, and it also completely excludes female rapists.

The best policy once a thread has been linked is to stop all voting in the thread, since this helps you avoid getting accidentally caught up in antibrigade measures."

But if you're wondering what it is in general, Feminist theory is a branch of literary criticism that can be applied to other texts, like games. It's incredibly complex, but the short version is that it privileges the feminine voice and interprets literature (and other stuff) as taking place in a patriarchal context to one degree or another.   That's it in a nutshell. And as I say, it's not my area. I only know as much about it as you pick up when getting a PhD in literature, and some of the stuff I've read for my own edification."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,TheIdesOfLurch,9,Mon Jul 20 01:08:49 2015 UTC,"No no, I know what that is. I was curious on your take on the game, damn it."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,Aikidi,11,Mon Jul 20 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm not qualified to do a feminist read of the game. I didn't like it, and I don't really even remember it. Probably a good entry point would be the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth, in that it's a classic example of male-dominated power differential which infantalizes Elizabeth and robs her of her agency. That's pretty facile though.   I guess you could dive into all the goobledegook multiple worlds shit at the end, talk about the fractionally of identity in a patriarchal structure and the ultimate delability of femaleness versus the indelibality of maleness, but now I'm wandering into the territory of I mostly don't know what I'm talking about.   Also, I wonder how long it's going to take for someone to wander in here and call me an SJW?"
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,TheIdesOfLurch,9,Mon Jul 20 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"FILTHY SJ just kidding, interesting takes on the game.  I think it was more of a ""nice try"" but fell short, Elizabeth having the powers she had was interesting, but somehow despite being a semi-godlike character she still felt like a damsel in distress most of the time.  Comparing it to Ellie in Last of Us it's clear how flat of a character she is in comparison and how much less agency she has, even though the dynamic between Booker/Elizabeth and Joel/Ellie is very similar."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,Aikidi,8,Mon Jul 20 02:34:05 2015 UTC,"I've actually talked about this in here before, but I find that Ellie is a pretty agency-free character as well, ultimately. She comes off as a strong character, but if you scratch the surface it become clear that she is not."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,TheIdesOfLurch,7,Mon Jul 20 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"She is a child, but also I think it depends on the section of the game. The DLC for instance is all Ellie and does a lot for her character as a whole imo. But to each their own."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,Aikidi,6,Mon Jul 20 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"It's not just that she's a child. Children can have agency. Hers is stripped from her by Joel in the end because, driven by his desire to supplant her as his daughter, the ultimate decision is taken away from her. Not that I think that's bad; I think that game is fantastic.   Also, I have not played the DLC so I definitely don't have the entire picture. I'm sure it fleshes her out quite a bit. Still, I'm not sure how anything in it could alter the perception of the ending of the game proper, unless at some point she's like ""I knew Joel was lying to me, but I chose to ignore it."" Just because a character if fleshed out doesn't mean they're in control. I think people confuse he with a strong character because she's brash and gets to do some killin'."
SubredditDrama,3dv1lp,Galle_,9,Mon Jul 20 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"Oh totally, but that is Joel's huge flaw. In that sense I think it is a loss of Ellie's agency not as a failure of the writers but as a failure of a character within the story. Which in turn can be sort of a look at the failures of traditional patriarchal ""heroes"" in a lot of stories.  I think she is a rich character but maybe not ""strong"" in the ""total master of her destiny"" sense.  And it isn't as though The Last of Us is an Audre Lorde essay or anything, I just think that it's a well written story with two good protagonists."

SubredditDrama,3dtx6t,TooHappyFappy,9,Sun Jul 19 21:00:55 2015 UTC,Those conspiracies were once dismissed as insane until they were proven correct.

SubredditDrama,3dtx6t,ComedicSans,5,Sun Jul 19 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"If it has no evidence, it's a crock of shit until there's evidence. That's how logic works.  Just because they got a few right doesn't mean any of the other ones are right. Luck is pretty random, so those could be the only ones those idiots ever get right.  EDIT: You're also falling victim to a flaw of human logic called confirmation bias. You know of the ones that were right because they were pretty big news, and that confirms your thoughts that maybe they're not all that batshit. However, do you know of all the theories that have no evidence behind them yet are believed fervently by those idiots, are you taking them all into account when composing your opinion?"
SubredditDrama,3dtx6t,Hypocritical_Oath,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:15:44 2015 UTC,Speculating that things go on that we don't know about and discussing what those things could be is illogical? Okay.  Painting an entire group of people with one brush is pretty damn illogical.

You've got a dog in this fight don't you? You're trying to seem impartial and like you haven't decided one way or the other, but is that true?"

If that's a dog in the fight then yeah, guilty as charged. I do question authority and don't just accept everything that's commonly believed.   That said, you jump right to lizard people though the vast majority of people who would consider themselves a conspiracy theorist think that's ridiculous, too. They may be even more pissed off at those people than you are because it allows people like you to dismiss everything legitimate they have to say unless they have concrete proof. They can't just have a reasonable argument to have people even consider it, it's gotta be explicit because of the reputation lizard people have given them.  You're using broad strokes and no matter the subject that's always illogical. When you criticize the the group because of the views of the fringe you're just as mistaken and wrong as the fringe itself."
SubredditDrama,3dtx6t,TooHappyFappy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"The difference being that there is actual legitimate evidence and confirmation that they carried out the 3 you mentioned.  MLK's court of law argument demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge of the differences between a civil and criminal court case.  The magic bullet theory demonstrates a lack of knowledge with regards to readily available information like the actual layout of the car and the positioning of the victims. Indeed the only way you can come to the magic bullet theory is by choosing to ignore actual evidence or by simply parroting other ignorant conspiracy theorists who buy into it.  The Jet fuel theory shows a lack of knowledge with regards to the structural integrity of steel.  Each of those 3 instances are reasons to dismiss someones opinion if they choose to believe in them because it demonstrates that they have no ability to actually fact check things they choose to believe in, so anything else that they claim to be true is likely built upon equally shabby foundations."

The MLK theory is largely baseless but does make people curious when a U.S. court finds some fault, it's not like they carry no weight."

It seems that the US's judgement has been so universally flawed that there might be a fundamental problem with the idea itself; perhaps it is that movements that need foreign support don't have domestic support, leading to oppression. And maybe its that popular movements are closer to socialism than apitalism -- meaning the US is almost necessarily going to be on the unpopular side of everything.   I think if you looked at the history, from Hawaii to the Philipines to Central America to Chile to Iran to Afghanistan to Argentina to Saudi Arabia, you'd be less casual about it.

You are saying it's ok for countries to support some ""social movements"" in some countries and oppose others. I suppose I agree with you there, but these ""social movements"" have a tendency to turn into civil wars and military dictatorships.   OK: Air America Radio or funding democracy movements or non-violent, civil consensus building measures.  Not OK: Expanded torture education (School of the Americas), selling weapons (everywhere), supporting violent overthrow of democratically elected regimes (Chile), propping up corrupt governments (Egypt, Pakistan), etc.   As far as the individual countries are concerned, I think they are better off  without major world powers goading them into civil war or sponsoring terrorism. It might be better to be an outright client state of one side instead.   Which brings us to what is best for the meddling powers. After the end of the cold war, I don't know what justifies our military spending or expanding global military presence. We don't seem to have an exceptionally beneficial trade situation for that expense, and our biggest advantage is our size and that the dollar is the global currency... so I don't know about Ethiopa or Angola, but what about the United States?

The countries there are a fiction, which is why there are constant wars between different ethnic groups (who often speak entirely different languages). If an ethnic group wants to throw in with the communists to get weapons, they probably will. In that situation, not much has changed, except one side has more guns.   I'm thinking more of places like Iran -- where a democratic government was replaced with a Western puppet who was then overthrown by a ""people's revolution"" of theocrats. It seems the more we meddle, the more problems we make; the recent asinine idiocy over Iran only convinces me that this will be the United States' SOP until we run out of money -- the way the British did after WWII."

SubredditDrama,3dvbx2,toclosetotheedge,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I'm talking about those few weeks before the album came out when The Blacker The Berry was the only hit released and people wondered what it was about. That he addresses black-on-black crime like it was something black people should care about more than white-on-black crime (or so it seemed to by most people's interpretations back then), plus his comments after the Ferguson riots, is what makes me believe he isn't so much the Antichrist to ""white people who listen to hip hop"" as the other comment make him out to be."

SubredditDrama,3dvbx2,toclosetotheedge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think what he said was inherently bad, but his timing as well as his wording definitely could've been better. Kendrick feels that both white people and black people can work together to erase racism, which I don't think is the worst opinion you can have.  Azaelia Banks and other people took his wording as saying that black people are the ones responsible for racism, which is a ridiculous and terrible idea and not what he was saying."
SubredditDrama,3dvbx2,OrangeAdventure,2,Mon Jul 20 09:16:29 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but Azaelia Banks is a moron and shouldn't be listened to at all besides when someone puts on 212."

Thing is that even though the current generation might be (more) comfortable with racial issues, the ones in charge of the hiring process now are mostly 50-ish years old.

SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,robotortoise,42,Mon Jul 20 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"My (rescue) cat has a tattoo, and the infection it gave her nearly killed her.  12 years ago, when she was desexed (neutered), it was customary at some rescue shelters to put a small tattoo in the cat's ear. To tell which cats were ready for adoption, I guess. She was about four months old when I adopted her, and she had recently had her operation and the tattoo. I presume they did it while she was under.  A few days after she came to live with us, she was suddenly very unwell. I could see that the tattoo was badly infected, so we took her to the shelter (free vet care), and she stayed in their vet hospital for a week.   So in short: if those are real, FUCK THAT GUY. And if they're not, fuck him for drawing on his poor cat with a fucking sharpie. Douche."

SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,TheIdesOfLurch,5,Mon Jul 20 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, maybe! My rescue cat is two this year. She wasn't spayed when I got her. They include the spaying fee in the adoption fee, to be done by their affiliated vet, or waive it if you can show documentation of spaying in a certain amount of time. I'm lucky enough to have a friend who's a veterinarian, so my Olive's spay was relatively cheap.   Anyhow, that's the system I'm familiar with: desexing after adoption. I have no idea if that's relative to locale or time, but it seems like it would be a good idea to just write ""kitty has had their naughty bits neutralized"" on a piece of paper, hang it on the cage, and have that bit of info entered into a spreadsheet or some shit."
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,BlackCaaaaat,3,Mon Jul 20 05:02:26 2015 UTC,"Spaying after adoption sounds risky, in terms of more kittens. I know it's free, but people forget, or can't be bothered taking the cat in."
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,TheIdesOfLurch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"It's not free, in my experience. The adoption center I worked with was pretty draconian. Tons of paperwork, and they wouldn't give us our kitten until our landlord gave the okay, even though we live in an a standalone house.   Ultimately it's a good thing though! It's a fucking pain in the ass, but it weeds out the less-than-competent adopters. At least in theory. There's a part of me that worries about rules so stringent that they dissuade otherwise perfectly acceptable people from adopting."

SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,nichtschleppend,27,Sun Jul 19 22:21:55 2015 UTC,I highhhhhhlllyyyyy doubt that the cat would have submitted to being tattoo'd while conscious.
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,snallygaster,32,Sun Jul 19 22:28:19 2015 UTC,Meaning that it was probably some bro with access to supplies rather someone actually qualified for the job of proper sedation.
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,snallygaster,15,Sun Jul 19 22:30:30 2015 UTC,heh in that case even without animal cruelty that's gotta be a crime.  or a rogue vet. urf.
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,BlackCaaaaat,18,Sun Jul 19 22:42:04 2015 UTC,I'm sure someone who thinks it is cool to tattoo their cat has some friends with access to every sedative and tranquilizer under the sun. I think it's more likely that the dude dosed his cat with GHB or Xanax than it is that a licensed vet agreed to sedate the cat for tattoos. I imagine that a vet could lose their license for tranquilizing a pet for a cosmetic procedure like this.
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,legumey,20,Sun Jul 19 22:50:57 2015 UTC,There's not really Anything good about this. The tattoo artist is not cool. The owner bro isn't cool. The assumed sedation bro isn't cool. Generally a group of people that represent a misappropriation of carbon.

The only reason anyone cares about this is because cute kitties. Reminder that this is an everyday practice
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,omcagk,37,Sun Jul 19 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Tattooing cats is like tattooing babies. It's unspeakably painful, only done for visual pleasure for the owner/parent because the cat/child has no say in the matter. There is no other benefit. Branding, while not exactly humane, serves a purpose. I can't speak about the modern practice, but it at least used to be meant to keep livestock from different establishments easily separated if they should mix together  somehow."
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,omcagk,16,Sun Jul 19 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"I've branded plenty of cattle. It's still a widely used method of keeping track of animals (ear tags get lost, tattoos can fade, etc). I prefer freeze branding, which is branding with liquid nitrogen rather than intense heat. The hair grows back white instead of whatever color the cow's fur was before, so it's like a permanent dye job. As soon as it makes contact with the skin the nerves die. The cows don't yell or move when you brand them - also doesn't smell nearly as bad as hot branding, and freeze brands heal a lot quicker.  Not for nothing, but I scrolled through your debate with this guy and I suggest actually speaking with producers rather than assuming all operations are ""deplorable"" or ""cruel."" It's one thing to absorb clips released from animal rights groups and dramatic documentaries, it's another to actually go to operations. Many farms give tours (agritourism is a huge thing in fact)...even some feedlots offer tours, if you want to see a yard. I've been on farms as small as a dozen cattle up to thousands in a herd, and if there's one thing that's consistent it's that farmers care about the livelihood of their animals. Aside from the fact that we're not all sociopaths like Food, Inc, PETA, and the rest like to claim, and actually respect the animals we use for food, it doesn't make any economical sense to have sick, abused, or mistreated animals. They won't thrive, they won't breed, they won't produce, etc, if they aren't in good health.  Just some food for thought (bad pun I know). Most of the myths perpetuated around the internet are just that.  I also find it insulting to constantly read on reddit and basically everywhere on the internet that farmers only care about money/profits or don't care about the welfare of an animal. I respect the livestock I've worked with over the years and you better believe I'd be first in line to deal with someone actually harming my animals. But I think there's a huge disconnect between the public and producers. Common husbandry practices are distorted into odd torture methods, animal behaviors that are normal to farmers may seem strange to the public who has never even touch a cow in their life, etc.  Sorry for the rambling reply, haha."
SubredditDrama,3dvi5a,4f4c414f,4,Mon Jul 20 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! And thank you for the respect you give your animals. In my opinion, every living creature deserves to have the best life possible. Doesn't matter if they're a pet or bred for food. They deserve to be happy. The idea of young calves being strapped down so tightly that they're unable to move just for the sake of white meat just makes me sick. I would love to be able to live in an area with family owned farms rather than major chain supermarkets.   Of course I understand that every owner and operator will run their establishment differently, but I'm mostly talking about factory farms being deplorable. The typical PETA style horribleness. I had no intention of making a blanket statement so I hope I didn't offend you."

That article goes on and on and on about the repercussions to the parents and how terrible they feel. None of that changes the fact that the child is dead. As bad as their life is going forward, at least they're alive to enjoy it. You can't say the same for the child.  And as my suggestion would suggest, nobody's talking about sending them to prison and throwing away the key. This is an incredibly low form of a homicide charge, with penalties ranging from 6 months to 15 years.   The bottom line is these parents owe a duty to their child that they colossally failed in. I don't care how bad you feel, how inadvertant it was, how sorry you are: you fucked up and your child died, you deserve to be punished. When a D.A. declines to press charges, he's protecting the parents instead of doing his job -- which is to protect the victims, especially here where the victim can no longer speak on his or her own behalf.   I'm baffled that this ""dilemma"" even exists. There's nothing ambiguous here, this is a case of people not carrying out their elected positions/jobs responsibly."
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,bougeotte15,35,Sun Jul 19 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Prosecution usually has discretion whether or not to charge. They make that decision based on several factors, including what a successful case would actually achieve.  There are many, many cases of people playing around, negligently responsible for the deaths of their friends. Here too, the prosecution can and does on occasion decline to prosecute.   Why? Look at the goals of sentencing. Provide justice for the victims. Deter future criminal acts by the defendant, or similar acts by others. Protect the community from further harms.  To deal with these factors in reverse:   The facts can and often do suggest that jailing the defendant will not make the community any safer. Where there is no pattern of negligence - and no intent to cause harm - you're not protecting the community from further dangerous acts by the distraught parent. To deter others? People like to believe that adding a jail sentence onto anything will stop people from doing it. But there are two problems: with crimes of intention, people typically act believing that they will not be caught - or not caring that they might. With, for lack of a better term, mistakes, nobody believes that they are going to leave their child in the car to die. That's something that happens to ""other people"". The sentence doesn't deter the act when it's so abstractly distant from everyday life.  And people act as if legal deterrents are the only deterrents. Even if you could get away with it scott-free, most people would recoil in horror at the thought of leaving their child to that fate. And those few that would do it intentionally? They are charged, with every offence the prosecution can throw at them. To deter future crimes by the defendant? It goes without saying that a sentence will achieve precisely nothing here that a lifetime of excruciating guilt cannot. Justice for the victim. This is the only tenet of sentencing where you can really make an argument. I wouldn't fault you for making your case here. But personally, I would ask, what justice is achieved? For a murder victim, there is satisfaction in knowing that your murderer will not get away for what they have done to you. For a victim of UDA (unlawful and dangerous act) manslaughter - say a 'one-punch' death - you'd want to know that the bastard stupid enough, violent enough or drunk enough to end your life is going to fucking feel the consequences of what they've done.   It's when you get to negligent manslaughter that the line starts to fade. There are plenty of instances where punishments should be and are still meted out. But there are also examples where it doesn't feel appropriate. My great-aunt and uncle forgot one of their four children once, and left her in a park. They were very lucky - and received one hell of a dressing-down from the man that found and watched her until they came back. Had the circumstances been a little different, do I feel comfortable knowing that they could have gone to jail? Would my aunt have wanted it?   So what's left? The sentence is imposed because we feel instinctively that something so egregiously wrong has happened that there needs to be some negative outcome for it. Every time a child dies like this, it is a tragedy. Except that tragedy doesn't begin to describe the scope of it - because it was totally preventable.   But criminal charges don't protect anyone. They don't stop it happening again in the future. They're certainly not going to teach the 'criminal' a lesson that isn't already etched in their heart. The perpetrator is also a victim of their own acts - as are their friends and extended families. And the only 'justice' is to hurt those left behind. That brings satisfaction to no one.  It's a numbers game. There are 350M people in the USA, and 20x that in the rest of the world. People are not omniscient - and with so many people making small mistakes on a daily basis, this will occasionally happen. And it is a small mistake - one more thing on the daily mental checklist - even if the consequences are huge. If we're serious about it, we need cars to be obnoxious about baby seats - not to keep punishing people after the fact."

Sometimes there just really isn't a benefit to charging someone in this type of case. A parent who left their kid in the car is going to run with that guilt for the rest of their lives. Putting them in jail, handing out fines, putting on probation, etc. just isn't going to help. The guilt alone is punishment enough."
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,Monkey_Junk,40,Mon Jul 20 15:09:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's just an extreme end of our justice system that forces us to ask how and why we punish people and for what.

No, there's no intent to harm the child here and obviously the parents feels terrible, but that doesn't alleviate them from all responsibility.

A reasonable person would never consciously leave their child in a car, no, but the issue is that forgetfully doing so could be within the scope of regular human fallibility and not always due to negligence. The article makes a case that there are circumstances where anyone could forget their child in a hot car, no matter how caring or responsible they are.

It can, says Mark McDaniel, PhD, a psychology professor at the university of Washington at St. Louis.  According to statistics compiled by a national childs’ safety advocacy group, in about 40 percent of cases authorities examine the evidence, determine that the child’s death was a terrible accident -- a mistake of memory that delivers a lifelong sentence of guilt far greater than any a judge or jury could mete out  “The quality of prior parental care seems to be irrelevant,” he said. “The important factors that keep showing up involve a combination of stress, emotion, lack of sleep, and change in routine, where the basal ganglia is trying to do what it’s supposed to do, and the conscious mind is too weakened to resist. What happens is that the memory circuits in a vulnerable hippocampus literally get overwritten, like with a computer program. Unless the memory circuit is rebooted—such as if the child cries, or, you know, if the wife mentions the child in the back—it can entirely disappear.”"

These products are not huge sellers. They have likely run up against the same marketing problem that confronted three NASA engineers a few years ago.  In 2000, Chris Edwards, Terry Mack and Edward Modlin began to work on just such a product after one of their colleagues, Kevin Shelton, accidentally left his 9-month-old son to die in the parking lot of NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The inventors patented a device with weight sensors and a keychain alarm. Based on aerospace technology, it was easy to use; it was relatively cheap, and it worked.  Janette Fennell had high hopes for this product: The dramatic narrative behind it, she felt, and the fact that it came from NASA, created a likelihood of widespread publicity and public acceptance.  That was five years ago. The device still isn’t on the shelves. The inventors could not find a commercial partner willing to manufacture it. One big problem was liability. If you made it, you could face enormous lawsuits if it malfunctioned and a child died. But another big problem was psychological: Marketing studies suggested it wouldn’t sell well.  The problem is this simple: People think this could never happen to them."

What happens is that the memory circuits in a vulnerable hippocampus literally get overwritten, like with a computer program. Unless the memory circuit is rebooted—such as if the child cries, or, you know, if the wife mentions the child in the back—it can entirely disappear.”   ?"

A middle ground exits between ""Depraved Murder"" and ""Completely Innocent.""  The parent in this case negligently performed actions that directly lead to the death of a child.  That the person didn't intend to cause harm means, yes, it's not murder, but there is still a victim, a dead victim, and it is the duty of a just society to seek justice on behalf of those who cannot."

Most of these cases involve parents who are otherwise perfectly adequate when it comes to taking care of their kids, and through an accident of stress, lack of sleep, a busy schedule, and faulty memory, they kill their children.  And then they have to spend the rest of their lives dealing with that.  I don't see how our society would at all be improved if these folks were to spend time in prison for this kind of crime."
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,Existential_Owl,29,Sun Jul 19 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Likelihood to recommit is a factor, but not the only factor.  A person who would otherwise not be dead, is dead.  The situation is tragic, and not intentional.  But someone is dead.  Because the victim cannot seek justice, it falls to the courts to do so.  Regardless of the circumstances.   ""Equal Justice Under Law"" is simply not the same as ""Punish People, But Only If They Don't Feel Bad Afterward."""
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,MackDaddyVelli,4,Sun Jul 19 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, someone is dead.  What, exactly, would sending the parents, who feel an incalculable, unimaginable amount of grief, to prison do to rectify that do?  It's not about ""we don't have to punish them because they feel bad and apologized.""  It's more along the lines of the fact that there is not a punishment that can be dealt by human hands that fits this crime.  For every day, for the rest of their lives, these people will wake up knowing that their child, their greatest joy in life, the thing that gave them purpose in existence, their contribution to the future of humanity that they loved more than anything in the world died slowly, painfully, and alone because of their negligence.  Every time they wake up, and every night before bed, they will be reminded of that fact.  It is the kind of torturous memory that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  There would be no justice in sending them to prison.  Sending them to prison would not be a punishment for them.  Sending them to prison would be a minor inconvenience compared to the infinite torture that is inflicted on them by their own mind.  And there's no sense in wasting the time of the American courts and the American penal system (both of which are already overburdened and need massive reform anyway) acting like we as a society are even capable of doling out a just punishment."
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,Existential_Owl,14,Sun Jul 19 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"there is not a punishment that can be dealt by human hands that fits this crime.   Yes there is.  It's called Negligent Homicide and, in many jurisdictions, can carry a sentence of less than a year in prison.   It is the kind of torturous memory that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.   If we, the people, had the ability to ask the victim, ""Do you want the authorities to press charges?"", then this would be a valid point to bring up.  If the person in question were the victim of a break-in, or a sexual assault, or an attempted murder, then the victim may choose to seek justice, or they may choose to forgive the perpetrators.  In the case of a homicide (negligent or otherwise), the victim doesn't get that choice.  It is the burden of the justice system to seek redress on behalf of those who have had that choice taken away from them.  It doesn't matter how the alleged feels about their actions; it's about justice for the victim."

It doesn't matter how the alleged feels about their action; it's about justice for the victim.   And I'm saying that the justice is inherent in the act.  The proper punishment is administered automatically by the conscience of the perpetrator.  The state doesn't need to act in order for justice to be served."

One of the major political justifications for our current legal system is deterrence—even though the evidence suggests that rehabilitation would be a loftier goal.   What exactly do you mean by justice?   ""Justice. [juhs-tis].  Noun.  5. the administering of deserved punishment or reward."""
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,rhynodegreat,3,Sun Jul 19 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'm asking what the sentence would be.  More generally, I don't think it would be just to punish the parents for making a mistake, even if that mistake was fatal. Justice is more nuanced than ""Oh you killed someone? Ok, life in prison."" There are always special circumstances."
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,Aikidi,7,Sun Jul 19 23:46:42 2015 UTC,So you just presume that a child who was killed entirely on accident would want their parents convicted of homicide? Who are you to decide what the deceased wants to happen to their parents?

SubredditDrama,3duz0a,ElectricFleshlight,8,Sun Jul 19 23:22:55 2015 UTC,"A few years ago my husband and I took our dog to the park for a late evening walk.  It was a nice evening, maybe 65 degrees, clear sky.  We spent some time walking around talking about our jobs, our home life, whatever came to mind.  We got back into the car and decided to swing by a Dairy Queen to pick up some milkshakes from the drive thru.  We got our shakes and pulled into a large empty parking lot overlooking the city, and continued talking for another hour while the dog curled up and slept in the backseat.  Tired, we decided it was time to go home.  We drove back, holding hands, happy with the wonderful evening we were able to spend together.  We got home, went inside, and snuggled on the couch to watch the latest episode of Breaking Bad.  When it was over I filled up the dog's food bowl, expecting her to come running, but she wasn't anywhere to be found.  Confused, I called her name, and then suddenly with a jolt I realized:  we left her in the back seat.  I ran out to the car and there she was peering through the window happy as a clam, tail wagging at full speed, perfectly fine.  I felt like a total shithead and a failure as a pet owner, because we honestly thought we had taken her inside.  To this day I'm extremely grateful it was night time and a comfortable temperature, and I've since made it a habit to leave my bag in the back seat whenever I'm in the car.  That way I always reach into the back to get it, and at this point it's muscle memory.   My worst fear is this happening with a child, because I know it can happen to me."

But second, this is a wonderful way to prevent this accident. If not a bag, your cell phone and/or wallet. Most people bring those items everywhere, unlike our dog or baby, so we'll always check for these things, know the feeling of them missing in our pockets, or at least have a habit of putting them down when we get home. Only downside I can think of is that some people will have trouble forming the new 'bag/phone/wallet in backseat' habit."

The people who think they dropped their kid off at daycare but forgot... that sounds like a total accident and I can understand how that would happen completely accidentally to an otherwise non-negligent parent. Your mind goes on autopilot when you're on your way to work and once you're there you're so involved and assume the kid is at daycare. I'm the person that autopilots all morning and then wonders: did I turn off my hot flat iron? Did I lock the door? Did I turn off the coffee machine? But it sounds like the child was to be in the parents care at home in this story because they got home and took a nap. It seems negligent that neither parent was like ""oh we have time for a nap because the baby is quiet.. wait,  where's the baby?"" But who knows the circumstances. I can't imagine not planning or checking what your baby is doing before you lay down at all though."

Prison isn't just to keep dangerous people out of society, but it is a punishment for what they did.

That kid died a slow miserable death because mom and dad forgot him.  They didn't walk away from the car for a second and then quickly go back to find their kid dead.  That would be an accident.  Forgetting about your kid for a long of enough time that he died of the intense heat in your car crosses the line into negligence.  There is a difference between an accident and negligence.
SubredditDrama,3duz0a,missbombshell,7,Sun Jul 19 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Forgetting is a quick accident. An example from the Washington Post article is the guy who left his kid in the car while working.

I'm trying to justify it to myself by saying my current PC is getting up there in age (I built it in 2009 and it has stayed mostly stock since then) and by saying I can re-purpose the current system to finally set up a home server.

The only reasons he's polling well are because he's been getting a huge amount of media attention and voters that aren't totally fucking crazy have split their vote among the huge number of serious candidates.  A lot of his views and actions are political poison for republicans, like his former support of abortion and the fact that he's donated more money to democrats (including Hillary) than to republicans, so once people seriously look at his history, he's done.  Even if he somehow wins the primary, the republicans can't win without support from Hispanic voters, and he's already alienated them.

Even if he ran as a third party candidate, I'd be shocked if he got more than a few percent of the popular vote.  Really, he'd just take a few percent of the vote from the republican candidate in swing states, giving the democratic nominee a significant advantage.

Even then, less than half of people over 65 support him.    Sure, he's doing great with Republicans, but he's turning more people away from Republicans at the same time."

Once the lower-tier candidates start falling off their votes are much likely to consolidate on guys like Walker and Bush than they are to switch to Trump. He's the sort of guy that's either top on your list or off of it entirely, with the possible exception of Ben Carson fans I guess. That guy's a fucking nut too.

There is even a discussion on how it's perceived to be handed out too frequently on the wiki page for it.    And, you keep on mentioning stuff that isn't the Bronze Star.

SubredditDrama,3dugoe,safarispiff,30,Sun Jul 19 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well, having been tortured kind of puts you off the stuff, regardless of political affiliation."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,libelecsBlackWolf,17,Sun Jul 19 20:53:28 2015 UTC,McCain lost his teeth to a ball-peen hammer.  He has a personal relationship with torture that other people just don't have.
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,davidreiss666,12,Mon Jul 20 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with McCain the Senator is that he personalizes a lot of his politics. He has a bad temper, holds a grudge like a mofo, and sometimes gives the appearance of doing things out of spite. He swung left after getting pissed at Bush (for very good reason) and went pretty far to the right following Obama's election. We can't mindread him, but it's well-known that he got bent at Obama over what he perceived as some sort of legislative betrayal in the Senate and there's a common perception that he's gone out of his way to fuck with him once he became President because of that."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,SorosPRothschildEsq,18,Sun Jul 19 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"I remember back in '08 they were hammering him for his service problems, then Palin came along and it was just easier to focus on her and subsequent missteps."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,dirtyrogue,19,Sun Jul 19 17:32:01 2015 UTC,I remember back in '08 they were hammering him for his service problems   Like what? The only thing I remember was far left blogs criticizing the fact he was involved in a lot of flight accidents before becoming a POW. The reality was that fires and wrecks were a lot more common back then.
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,GhostofRFS,4,Sun Jul 19 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Like what?   I remember when General Clark(who was running for the DNC nomination) made a snarky ""losing 5 planes doesn't make you a hero"" comment.  Oddly, it never made much traction in the media like it did with Trump, maybe because he was a vet himself."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,R_B_Kazenzakis,6,Mon Jul 20 00:30:11 2015 UTC,Flight issues and using his name for special privileges are the two I remember.
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,dirtyrogue,16,Sun Jul 19 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"Odd thing to claim, since he was offered early release because of his father's status and refused because it goes against the Code of Conduct."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,GhostofRFS,5,Sun Jul 19 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"But isn't his lack of other notable actions kinda due to him being a POW?  I get that it's a hypothetical ""heroism"" situation, but it seems a little like criticizing a guy in prison for idk not getting his car inspected or something."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,Yuputka,9,Mon Jul 20 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Not to belittle his experience as a POW, but I think they're arguing that the idea of a War Hero implies something a little less, er, passive and more like something between that and a made up Rambo-like scenario.  someone else pointed out his actions in the USS Forrestal fire. I'd say that that's heroic."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,GingerbreadKlansman,6,Sun Jul 19 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"Not to belittle his experience as a POW, but I think they're arguing that the idea of a War Hero implies something a little less, er, passive and more like something between that and a made up Rambo-like scenario.   I think there are a lot of POWs who caved and acted in propaganda pieces...while McCain didn't.  People like him and Admiral Stockdale certainly stuck to the code of conduct as best as possible while many weren't able to(Stockdale famously wanted to bring quite a few POWs up on charges because they failed to adhere to it).  Hence ""heroic""."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,R_B_Kazenzakis,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"Making it through his POW experience was a bit more than just a passive thing though.   I'm a left wing liberal, I disagree with McCain on a lot of policy stuff.   But more than 99% of people would just give up and just die instead of allowing themselves to be treated the way the North Vietnamese treated McCain and many of his fellow prisoners.   Survival wasn't a passive thing on his part, nor was it simple."
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,davidreiss666,22,Mon Jul 20 00:20:34 2015 UTC,This is a long way to go just to make Jeb seem more reasonable.
SubredditDrama,3dugoe,secondarykip,3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Most people fuck up along the way, and regardless of how you feel about any other aspect of McCain's personality or politics, most people never get a chance for even one great moment.  McCain's great moment was refusing to be released (from torture, no less) if his fellow POWs were not released with him. That takes serious stones.  Most people don't even approach that, ever. Those who do don't then go on to become senators and almost president. McCain is pretty incredible any way you slice it."

SubredditDrama,3dwnha,chimpfunkz,5,Mon Jul 20 08:19:27 2015 UTC,Regular human injuries provide the vast majority of data used in rehabilitative medicine. Whatever data they're gathering is not worth the torture of those animals.
SubredditDrama,3dwnha,Yerwun,4,Mon Jul 20 09:15:44 2015 UTC,That's probably because animal testing is so comparatively rare.
SubredditDrama,3dwnha,Nixflyn,5,Mon Jul 20 10:16:16 2015 UTC,"No, it's because humans have a unique  spinal and muscular anatomy, so the only way to learn about  spinal injuries in humans is to study spinal injuries in humans."
SubredditDrama,3dwnha,Yerwun,3,Mon Jul 20 10:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to be the big conundrum right now. We don't have the knowledge or computational power to accurately model in situ biology, so we have to do real world experiments, so the question becomes which is more ethical: human or animal testing?"

SubredditDrama,3dwnha,Wiseduck5,0,Mon Jul 20 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"The issue is not with how effective the research is, the issue is whether it is ethical to conduct at all.  I mean, I could learn a lot about spine injuries in humans by taking prisoners on death row and bashing their heads in using the same techniques used on those chimpanzees. The data would be even more valid than the chimpanzee data since the anatomy isn't close to human, it is human. Human testing would be far quicker and more informative than animal testing, so why aren't we doing it?"
SubredditDrama,3dwnha,wotoan,6,Mon Jul 20 15:53:12 2015 UTC,There's the problem. Researchers are trying to find a solution on a sliding scale of ethical vs quick data. I have no solution myself.

SubredditDrama,3dwnha,ttumblrbots,2,Mon Jul 20 03:47:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the things they do to animals are barbaric and really don't serve enough of a purpose to be in any way justified. For example, lesion studies. This is where they destroy a part of an animal's brain to see what will happen to it. It might make it blind or paralysed or both, eat until it dies, be unable to sleep until it slowly goes insane and dies, starve itself. What marvelous data.  Except that it's almost never of any real use and in this day of fMRIs is inexcusable (though imo it always was).  Did you know that in the 50s, there was this stupid hypothesis that you couldn't feel fear if you couldn't feel your body? Did they go and test this dumbass notion with the consent of some paraplegic humans? No; they severed dogs' spinal chords and then checked to see if they could still scare them. What do you know, they could. Thanks doggy for your noble contribution.  Shit like this still happens today, all the time. Sometimes I think we're horrible animals."
SubredditDrama,3dwnha,Yerwun,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:24:45 2015 UTC,"The amount of lesion studies that took place in the 50s was enormous compared to the amount of studies now. It has become pretty hard to get permits for lesion studies, especially in primates. Those rarely ever happen anymore, especially with the emergence of TMS, fMRI and similar techniques.   there was this stupid hypothesis that you couldn't feel fear if you couldn't feel your body   This might seem stupid now but keep in mind that back then we just didn't know. I'm not arguing about the techniques they used though, it was horrifying. But keep in mind that once upon a time we thought that the sun orbited the earth. What's common knowledge now has been researched at some point in the past so that's really not an argument."

Transgender rights should just be acknowledged. The importance of black lives should just be a given. Equal pay should just be granted. But they're not. And so our passion and energy as liberals, leftists, whatever, is directed one way rather than another. How hard can we fight for electoral reform when all our energy goes into fighting for ours and others' rights just to be happy? That's what I'm saying.   This is the problem with American politics. Our politicians thrive on social issues. They bang the drum for us and reap the benefits.   It's possible to be a champion of social justice and still be incredibly frustrated and disillusioned. There's always a group being disenfranchised. There's always a group fighting against the interests of the disenfranchised group. Rinse. Repeat. This is how two party politics works. Us vs Them.

SubredditDrama,3dw0cw,Deceptiveideas,9,Mon Jul 20 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"Man, I remember when ELI5 was created.  It was such a neat idea.  And there were those early growing pains about whether it should be explained like you were literally five or just as to a layman, and they ultimately decided on a layman.  And for a while there, it usually had some pretty swell content.  Then, it went the way of all pretty swell subreddits that get defaulted."
SubredditDrama,3dw0cw,MackDaddyVelli,6,Mon Jul 20 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, I remember subscribing to it long before it had such a heavy userbase and a default.   Once subs become defaults, the quality of them dives down to horrible levels. There's just too many users complaining about every bit of moderation. 2X for example is just a former shadow of its self and most of its original userbase has left.  I don't think the moderator did anything wrong here. I also feel like the ""Getting beat by your Daddy"" is a bad example to use. ELI5 tries to make sure the top posts aren't all humor so people focus on the answer and not the humor. As in the case here, there were multiple users commenting on the Daddy comment."
SubredditDrama,3dw0cw,MackDaddyVelli,10,Mon Jul 20 01:10:11 2015 UTC,"2X for example is just a former shadow of its self and most of its original userbase has left.   2X is, I think the most tragic example of this phenomenon.  I saw a thread a week or two ago about another celebrity calling herself an ""egalitarian"" instead of a feminist, and any comment on that post that promoted feminism or called the celebrity misguided for promoting this non-existent distinction was insanely downvoted, and all of the top comments were cheering her on and calling feminism old and outdated.  It blew my damn mind how dramatically that sub has changed since it was made a default.  It's kind of an ironic catch-22 for the admins.  They want to have good defaults to show new users their best face, but the userbase (or at least the participatory userbase) is so disproportionately young, white, sexist, racist boys that any default subreddit very quickly becomes the dregs of the site."

You have to understand that when a woman doesn't want feminism, no means no. Did feminism do great things for women in the past? Sure! But that was a different time, and modern women don't owe feminists any more than a person would owe someone sex because ""i'm always nice to you!"" or ""we've did it before!"", or African Americans owe the Republican party for fighting against racism before the party switch."

After being given a dictionary definition of feminism, then it was 57% who identified as feminists, 47% of men, and 67% of women.  Of course the other discussion is why so many people wouldn't call themselves feminists, unless it's defined to them.

It's similar to the IRA as there is no longer a single IRA.  So when someone says the IRA did this or that they are not actually talking about the original IRA but one of the off shoots of it.

I saw a thread the other day where a guy at a work party saw two co-workers (one married with kids and one engaged) make out when they were wasted. They avoided each other after that and didn't seem to be having an affair or anything, so the guy figured informing their partners wasn't the best thing to do. Instead, his wife did it anonymously. He was kind of irked, and all /r/relationships did was call him a coward for not doing it himself and say his wife was a way better person than him.  Am I crazy? In the scheme of a whole marriage, is being stupid and kissing someone drunk literally the worsr thing ever?

Like if you wanna talk about one partner breaching trust and needing to come clean why can't it be the guy threatening suicide if she leaves? Don't you think being abusive and controlling might be a 'cause' as well.  And I'm saying this as someone who was cheated on in a similar way. Looking back I contributed to her decision as much, if not more so, because of my behavior. Her breaking up with me a few hours earlier would not have helped anything, it usually just leads to ""she's banging dudes too soon."""
SubredditDrama,3du2ry,barrywhiteseadiving,15,Sun Jul 19 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"but cheating is very clean-cut   No, it's not. As barrywhiteseadiving noted, it's particularly not clean-cut when abuse is involved. We don't know the extent of the abuse here, and it sounds like the OP is reluctant to describe it in too much detail because he was friends with the guy. But things like threatening suicide if you break up with them, or being ""hurtful in arguments,"" put you into a situation where you don't feel like you can get out of the relationship, even though you might desperately want to, where you're terrified of the other person and what they might do, and where at the same time you no longer have the emotional support you need in a relationship despite the abuse meaning you need it even more. This puts you into a place where you can quickly become attached to someone who starts trying to provide emotional support, but at the same time, you're terrified of breaking up because you don't know what the person might do, and your will and reason is broken from having experienced the abuse for so long.  I was actually in a similar situation once, except as the person in the abusive relationship. I had been suffering in it for two years, and felt like I couldn't do anything to get out of it: there was constant emotional abuse involved, frequent physical abuse to the level of my lying to others about injuries, her threats to kill herself or kill both of us if I broke up with her, her threats to say that I had raped her, have me thrown out of university, and destroy my family's company, and so on... even if some of these seem implausible in hindsight, your perspective gets skewed when living in such a relationship, and I also felt that I needed to try to help her, even if she absolutely refused to get help for her significant psychological issues. So I was stuck going home every day knowing that she'd probably have been watching television or exercising most of the day, and there was a good chance she'd beat me, or at least spend the night yelling at me. She had caused me to drive away most of my friends, and had destroyed my finances, such that I didn't have much of a life beyond being with her.  Then a friend of mine, who seemed to realize that something was wrong with the relationship, as some people did, and felt that she wanted to do something about it, started talking to me more. When I started talking about the relationship, she was horrified, and tried to emotionally support me, while I was happy to have someone to talk with. We ended up emotionally attached to each other, and she gave me the strength and support that I needed to be able to break up with my girlfriend, something I don't think I would have been able to do on my own. But the emotional attachment did lead to us cheating as well. On my part, the abuse had left me a mess, and on her part, I think she thought little enough of my girlfriend that she didn't care.  Of course, in my story, unlike the thread's, I broke up with my girlfriend, she had a fit, ended up in a temporary psych hold, then crashed a party we had gone to, attacked my friend, and then threatened me into staying with her and enduring the abuse for two more years..."

The wife was in an abusive relationship, and while he was serving a sentence for convicted domestic violence, she met someone else and began an affair. She moved out before her husband's sentence was up and took their kids.  .... not a great example, though, since shortly after that he stabbed her to death during a custody exchange in the parking lot.

Relationships aren't something most people fall from the womb, fully formed about.  They are usually a process of bad judgement and experience informing us on how to do it better in the future.  Cheating is shitty behavior, but it's also a pretty common happening in relationships, so focusing on how to turn it into a learning experience rather than a self-immolating one is probably always going to be more productive.  It's just an easy way to gin up the outrage machine, and that's a more fun indulgence for most people."

I wouldn't call it a complete shitstorm.   Previous to those deletions,  there a lot of comments about bias, questionable American support of Israel, and someone even innocently recommend a similar doc from the BBC. A lot of it was healthy discussion, but some of it came dangerously to antisemitism and included conspiracy theories such as denial of how bad the holocaust was. I can definitely understand some of the deletes, but I'm not sure if the mods needed to go full scorched earth.  For instance, the discussion I was in, was about the different biases of news media such as Al Jazeera. There wasn't anything that was anti-Semitic or very controversial in that thread. I'm kind of disappointed because I put effort into my post.  This is also my third time posting this as it keeps getting deleted haha.

No, the argument is that the point where contributing to discussion was over because a brigade of 'da joos' posters arrived.  It's not an unusual internet discussion forum moderation tactic to nuke an entire comment thread when it gets shitty enough that the vast majority of new replies are going to be off-topic or rule-breaking, even if it means a handful of legitimate comments get taken out in the crossfire.  In fact it's so not unusual that I have never been involved with an internet forum that didn't thread nuke once in a while in my 15-ish year career of message board dwelling, and I'm positive that there are some older dudes than me who can attest to it happening before then even.

SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,GravityKills,8,Sun Jul 19 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"The exact phrasing used by Cato and the other Roman Senators isn't fully agreed upon.    The memetic form of the Delenda Est line favors ""Delenda est Cathago"", as seen in Exhibit A: Lord Chancellor Shaftsbury's speeches in Parliament circa 1672.  So, with regards to making a historical allusion, ""Delenda Est Freeze Peach"" is slightly closer to the intent behind the reference than ""Freeze Peach Delenda Est.""  Drops mic"

SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,TheIdesOfLurch,11,Sun Jul 19 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said it should be ""Freeze Peach Delenda Est.""  Is it a possible translation? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a serial shitposter who once read a history book (while sitting on the actual shitter), I am telling you, specifically, in serial shitposting, no one quotes Cato as saying ""Cathago Delenda Est."" If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""Cathago Delenda Est"" you're referring to the wikipedia interpretation of Cato's infamous remark, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for saying ""Delenda est Freeze Peach"" instead of ""Freeze Peach Delenda Est"" is because I can't grammar a dead language?  Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling out the O-V-S word order as needing to be S-O-V? It's not one or the other, that's not how literary allusions work. They're both. ""Delenda est Freeze Peach"" is ""Delenda est Cathago"" and is a member of the literary allusion family. But that's not what you said. You said ""Your flair should be 'Freeze Peach Delenda Est'"", which is not true unless you're okay with eschewing the memetic use of the original phrase, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

And yet I don't remember /r/documentaries getting upset when the 'Hitler was okay I guess' documentary was downvoted when it got posted by an actual neo-Nazi. This time around it gets a special pass when an anti-Semite posts this video, though.  This documentary was produced by Al-Jazeera based off of the works of James Ennes, a survivor of the USS Liberty incident who turned conspiratist because he insists the attack was deliberate (all US government reports concluded it was an accident).   The sources are so steeped in bias that if we take this ""documentary"" seriously then we need to take Dinesh D'Souza's America: Imagine the World Without Her as fact as well. Although something tells me the crowd in there claiming the documentary is legitimate probably have that one on their favorites list as well..."
SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,jackrousseau,-14,Mon Jul 20 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"Every USS Liberty veteran on record about the incident insists in very strong terms that it was deliberate. It's pretty clearly folly to trust any government when it comes to incidents of geopolitical importance, after all. The fact that the USG rushed an investigation (10 days when months were needed) is not a good sign.  Here's a good piece about it. http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-liberty_tuesoct02-story.html"
SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,_lol_reddit_,26,Sun Jul 19 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"The NSA Israeli radio chatter released in 2003 confirms that the pilots absolutely believed they were attacking an Egyptian ship.  Vets that were part of a traumatic experience are hardly the voice of reason. And no, every USS Liberty vet did not go on record saying it was deliberate (which is precisely why Ennes's work is worthless, as he ignores the sources that go against him).  The ultimate problem with the ""it was deliberate"" camp is that it makes zero sense whatsoever other than it trying to confirm an anti-Semitic belief that Israel is evil and will attack even its allies in an attempt to make them believe it was an enemy who did (And if that was the case, then why leave radio chatter fingerprints all over it? Because there was never any doubt the jets were Israeli).  FF is an all too common thing in war. When the US or the Soviets or the British accidentally killed civilians in FF incidents, everyone kind of just grumbled and nodded their head saying, ""Accidents happen."" When Israel has a FF incident, all of the sudden the country the size of New Jersey is held to extraordinary circumstances once again and everyone insists it couldn't possibly have been an accident."
SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,jackrousseau,-13,Sun Jul 19 04:39:24 2015 UTC,"Edit: Why not read the Chicago Tribune piece instead of reflexively downvoting? It is well researched and entirely credible.   The NSA Israeli radio chatter released in 2003 confirms that the pilots absolutely believed they were attacking an Egyptian ship.   Read that piece, then. They found several people who went on record saying it was bullshit, and edited.  ""The attack ""couldn't be anything else but deliberate,"" the NSA's director, Lt. Gen. Marshall Carter, later told Congress.  ""I don't think you'll find many people at NSA who believe it was accidental,"" Benson Buffham, a former deputy NSA director, said in an interview...  The transcript published by the Jerusalem Post bore scant resemblance to the one that in 1967 rolled off the teletype machine behind the sealed vault door at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, where Steve Forslund worked as an intelligence analyst for the 544th Air Reconnaissance Technical Wing, then the highest-level strategic planning office in the Air Force.  ""The ground control station stated that the target was American and for the aircraft to confirm it,"" Forslund recalled. ""The aircraft did confirm the identity of the target as American, by the American flag.  ""The ground control station ordered the aircraft to attack and sink the target and ensure they left no survivors.""  Forslund said he clearly recalled ""the obvious frustration of the controller over the inability of the pilots to sink the target quickly and completely.""  ""He kept insisting the mission had to sink the target, and was frustrated with the pilots' responses that it didn't sink.""  Nor, Forslund said, was he the only member of his unit to have read the transcripts. ""Everybody saw these,"" said Forslund, now retired after 26 years in the military.  Forslund's recollections are supported by those of two other Air Force intelligence specialists, working in widely separate locations, who say they also saw the transcripts of the attacking Israeli pilots' communications.  One is James Gotcher, now an attorney in California, who was then serving with the Air Force Security Service's 6924th Security Squadron, an adjunct of the NSA, at Son Tra, Vietnam.  ""It was clear that the Israeli aircraft were being vectored directly at USS Liberty,"" Gotcher recalled in an e-mail. ""Later, around the time Liberty got off a distress call, the controllers seemed to panic and urged the aircraft to 'complete the job' and get out of there.""  Six thousand miles from Omaha, on the Mediterranean island of Crete, Air Force Capt. Richard Block was commanding an intelligence wing of more than 100 analysts and cryptologists monitoring Middle Eastern communications.  The transcripts Block remembered seeing ""were teletypes, way beyond Top Secret. Some of the pilots did not want to attack,"" Block said. ""The pilots said, 'This is an American ship. Do you still want us to attack?'  ""And ground control came back and said, 'Yes, follow orders.'""  Gotcher and Forslund agreed with Block that the Jerusalem Post transcript was not at all like what they remember reading.  ""There is simply no way that [the Post transcript is] the same as what I saw,"" Gotcher said. ""More to the point, for anyone familiar with air-to-ground [communications] procedures, that simply isn't the way pilots and controllers communicate.""  Block, now a child protection caseworker in Florida, observed that ""the fact that the Israeli pilots clearly identified the ship as American and asked for further instructions from ground control appears to be a missing part of that Jerusalem Post article.""  Arieh O'Sullivan, the Post reporter who made the newspaper's transcript, said the Israeli Air Force tapes he listened to contained blank spaces. He said he assumed those blank spaces occurred while Israeli pilots were conducting their strafing runs and had nothing to communicate.  'But sir, it's an American ship!'  Forslund, Gotcher and Block are not alone in claiming to have read transcripts of the attack that they said left no doubt the Israelis knew they were attempting to sink a U.S. Navy ship.  Many ears were tuned to the battles being fought in and around the Sinai during the Six-Day War, including those belonging to other Arab nations with a keen interest in the outcome.  ""I had a Libyan naval captain who was listening in that day,"" said a retired CIA officer, who spoke on condition that he not be named discussing a clandestine informant.  ""He thought history would change its course,"" the CIA officer recalled. ""Israel attacking the U.S. He was certain, listening in to the Israeli and American comms [communications], that it was deliberate.""  The late Dwight Porter, the American ambassador to Lebanon during the Six-Day War, told friends and family members that he had been shown English-language transcripts of Israeli pilots talking to their controllers.  A close friend, William Chandler, the former head of the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line Co., said Porter recalled one of the pilots protesting, ""But sir, it's an American ship -- I can see the flag!' To which the ground control responded, 'Never mind; hit it!'""  Porter, who asked that his recollections not be made public while he was alive because they involved classified information, also discussed the transcripts during a lunch in 2000 at the Cosmos Club in Washington with another retired American diplomat, Andrew Kilgore, the former U.S. ambassador to Qatar.  Kilgore recalled Porter saying that he ""saw the telex, read it, and passed it right back"" to the embassy official who had shown it to him. He quoted Porter as recalling that the transcript showed ""Israel was attacking, and they know it's an American ship.""  Haviland Smith, a young CIA officer stationed in Beirut during the Six-Day War, said that although he never saw the transcript, he had ""heard on a number of occasions exactly the story that you just told me about what that transcript contained.""  He had later been told, Smith recalled, ""that ultimately all of the transcripts were deep-sixed. I was told that they were deep-sixed because the administration did not wish to embarrass the Israelis.""  That's an overwhelming amount of information that you just ignored. Are all these independent sources making it up in exactly the same way? I doubt it.   The ultimate problem with the ""it was deliberate"" camp is that it makes zero sense whatsoever   It makes a shitload of sense. The Israelis were afraid they would get the blame for starting a war, since they knew the Liberty was listening in. So they sink it, kill everyone, and boom - no proof they started a war. It's not difficult to understand."

So was the attack on the Chinese embassy.  The question is, was it a deliberate attack on what they believed to be an American ship?  The answer is...probably not.  There are a bunch of problems with the claim.  Anyway, here's my go-to blurb about it.  Keep in mind, I link to the Liberty's own log books in it, for those of you who do the ""Liberty Vets on record..."" thing.  The USS Liberty was a AGI -a surveillance ship-, in the USN in the late 60s.  Her sister ship was the USS Pueblo which was attacked by the North Koreans with LCDR ""Pete"" Bucher captured.    But this is about the USS Liberty.  During the Six-Day War she was in the Eastern Mediterranean and bombed by Israeli aircraft, followed up with a flyby by a Israeli helicopter and an attack by Israeli MTBs.  The Liberty limped back to Malta.  It was a horrible event and the Israelis have since maintained it was a accident, and even given reparations.  So naturally the ""THE JOOS"" crowd is out in force about it, and has been basically since Day 1.  There are some problems with the assumption that the Israelis attacked the Liberty knowing it was an American naval vessel:   The use of Napalm instead of actual anti-ship munitions indicates that it was a ad hoc action on the part of the IDF, presumably if they had had this planned out from the get-go they would chosen munitions that would have surely gotten rid of all witnesses. Much has been made of the the large holiday flag that was present on the port yardarm when the MTBs attacked.  Problem?  They attacked abaft off the starboard quarter, while the ship had 'large areas of the ship with flames and heavy smoke' . People seem to be starting with the assumption that the Israelis themselves are so competent that they couldn't have misidentified the Liberty(yet really screwed the pooch on munitions choice).  In fact, the IDF is far, far from competent.  They only appear to be so because they are fighting neighbors who are basically the absolute bottom of the barrel in quality.  These are the same guys who had the EW suite of their ships turned off and unmanned in a area suspected to have anti-ship missiles.  The Israelis are not supersoldiers, far from it. Even if they were on the same tier as Western militaries, Many times have Western militaries have acted similarly stupidly.  In case you're too lazy to click on the links, that's Australian-on-American, American-on-Australian, and Turkish-on-Turkish.  Within a decade of the Liberty incident.  The number increases the further out we get, in either direction."

The Jews or the Muslims?"").  Like I said, your actual line of thinking is: ""Well, people are saying positive things about Israel--it must be shills!"" At which point you should just pick up your /r/conspiracy card now and go the whole nine yards."
SubredditDrama,3dt2ix,jackrousseau,-9,Sun Jul 19 12:52:59 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, you along with everyone else has noticed that anti-Semites and Nazis live on Reddit in large numbers. How that translates into ""they're going to bat for the Palestinians, who they also think are subhuman"" is beyond me.   Thinking Hasbara actually affects the voting patterns in Reddit is pretty laughable   If you get to a thread and set some comments at +10 and others at -10, the hive mind will take over and replicate it. Reddit works like that. It is extremely easily to manipulate opinion, which is why there are constantly shitstorms about it.   your actual line of thinking is: ""Well, people are saying positive things about Israel--it must be shills!""   No, and I explained very clearly how that's a god damn stupid caricature. Educate yourself on how Bayesian thinking works and how you can string together a series of events with different probabilities of being true to get an updated probability. There is a lot of extremely suspicious behavior going on. Who the fuck consistently has 6-8 hours a day to post talking points? What kind of a human being would do that for free?"

I posted my full list here on SRD some time ago but the mods didn't take it too kindly (understandably, it promotes witch hunts, as it turns out of actual witches). Nice to see I was right, and makes sense when I take those particular folks on I get downvote bombed near immediately.  Truth be told, I got super pissed off about it once and strongly considered getting a bunch of virtual machines running to mass produce alts and downvote bomb them the fuck back for a laugh, but I figured it was too much work and not worth being banned myself for. I'm sure someone does that though. Like Unidan.  I'm banned from /r/conspiracy by that vaping bird mask guy but I would gladly share my entire list and other info in private."

It is censorship, and I personally think its wrong.  Most of the comments are directed at the deletion of comments, their community is expressing opposition to the mods actions.  When your userbase is at odds with the direction your sub is taking, I don't know, that might be a problem.  If it was just a vocal minority posting a bunch of wackjob conspirtard nonsense then the community would self regulate it by downvoting posts it didn't like.

Regardless of anyone's opinion on the matter, YouTube (and probably some news sites as well) popularized the whole AdBlock trend.

I like watching a sitcom on Youtube and most of those videos have four video ads for one episode which is especially annoying when I want to watch the videos to fall asleep, but don't want to get up to the computer every time a commercial begins, which would be necessary to skip the ads after five seconds, some of which will otherwise go for two minutes.  So basically my question is: Can I (de)activate ABP for only certain YT channels? I don't think it's possible, which is unfortunate because I'd really like to support content I like, like I do it with other sites as well."

They're probably not up there entirely legally. My suggestion would be that you'd be better off torrenting them. Downloaded content tends to be a much nicer experience in general than streaming content.  But to answer your question, I have heard of some extensions that will allow selective blocking of ads on YouTube channels, but they're their own specific extension, not ABP. And I'm not sure exactly which extension that would be, because I've never used it. You could try Googling ""YouTube channel ad blocker"" or something like that, I guess."
SubredditDrama,3dt2l4,Zagorath,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion.  I don't torrent anything because it can lead to hefty fines where I live. I actually am thankful, it's just annoying to see people who upload content they didn't create themselves and adding several ads, while most content creators just have an ad at the very beginning of their videos."

SubredditDrama,3dt2l4,Zagorath,7,Mon Jul 20 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, but I mainly use Adblock because I don't want some terribly coded ad bringing my laptop or tablet down. And I don't want to get infected with something. Even the mainstream ad providers have been tricked into serving up some sort of malware.   If the site I'm visiting decides to block me based on my use of a blocker, than I think that's completely fair. I'd also be fine if a site asked me for a buck or two for access in exchange for blocking the ads. This would also be fair, especially for a site where I'd play around with it for an hour and then completely forget about it afterwards."

Some of the more annoying youtube ads is making it really tempting to install one though, like the ones that goes on for minutes if you don't interrupt it (I like to sometimes have a youtube playlist on my second monitor autoplay videos while i'm doing something)."
SubredditDrama,3dt2l4,Ailure,4,Sun Jul 19 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"While we're talking rationalizations, I have AD/HD and adblocking is a godsend for me. In the distant past I'd have to bring up instances of Notepad and position them strategically over the screen just to concentrate on the page's content. To me it's pretty straightforward: ads are designed specifically to be just attention-grabbing enough to achieve their goals with the general public. Which means for me they're just way too attention-grabbing.  I try to be fair, and compromise with custom filters that let non-obtrusive ads through while still blocking anything animated mercilessly. But that's not really a compromise that a lot of advertisers respect properly and there's always problems."

Not to mention this is already a dumb post. There's little to no drama. No one is happy about it, but there's not really a group arguing FOR it either.   TL;DR ads aren't the problem, the complete blockage of site is.  Edit: so this was basically at +8ish til the brigading from whoever has such a vested interest in advertising. Guess you're totally okay in blind content denial without some way to know what's on that site beforehand. Even though malware can come from these ads still has you guys all on board attacking me for worrying about my security. Really classy."

The fact is the sites that tend to be good about it, and are more suggesting instead of demanding, are just more respectable as a whole.

I want them to respect the user. The reason we got to this point to begin with is THEY posted pop-up ads, ads inside of ads, hidden window ads, ads that play sound without being asked, ads that open windows with redirect loops, ads linking to malware, so on and so forth.

I use it to protect my system just like my antivirus. I heavily disagree with giving anyone the benefit of the doubt on the internet. This is how your system gets loaded with viruses, this is how your passwords get snooped, this is how your identity can be compromised.   I'll pass. I didn't even fiddle around with this guy's site just because it was so late at night, and still is. But I just don't like the idea of a complete site lock for adblock users.

I already said it in another comment. The advertisers started this. The pop ups, the automatic sound playing ads, the ""magically appears when you click something"" ads, the redirect loops, the viruses, the malware.

I don't agree with that   I think you need to expand on this, since this is where people are disagreeing with you.   You are getting a service from them, they have to pay for that service, the way in which they pay for that service is through ads. If you're denying them the revenue from that you're actually costing them money by enjoying their website, since they're paying to host stuff for you to see without getting any form of reimbursement.  You said somewhere else you want them to respect the user: why do you feel like you're entitled to that? they're a website giving you shit for free, you are doing nothing that would make them obliged to treat you in a certain way.

Literally nothing changes if I use adblock or not? So it goes right to the whitelist. Shitty popups? Ads that play sound? Easy. Blacklist.  This here is new. It doesn't even give me the option to see the site at all. I don't know what's on it. I have no way to basically scout out like I would any other site. I think that's a little absurd.   I seem to be getting all these downvotes as if I'm sitting here saying ""fuck advertisements"". I have never said this. I have very specifically said that specific types of advertisements are indeed things I am not comfortable with. Let me preface by saying I didn't bother going to the site, this rubbed me the wrong way so much. That said,  if the banner ad opened a pop-up and had a child yelling for no reason and flashed lights in a strobe, is that okay?

Google is in its current form, no ads, nothing going on. Everything is cool, right?  Now lets picture that same homepage with Flashing strobe ads. Make one of them make lots of noise for nothing. Make the other override the browser entirely and link somewhere else.   You'd probably want adblock here now, right? Hypothetical Google's ads are overbearing. And they're not the only ones. Site after site have been doing this. Older sites open up to malware. Its ugly on the net.  Now you want to go to hypothetical Reddit, right? Having dealt with years and years of popups and other nonsense. There's a handful of good sites. Reddit doesn't throw ads all over, you're cool with that. You can whitelist the site as 'safe'.   Along comes site C. Uhhhh. EBay. Now you hear cool things about hypothetical eBay. It was a top post on Reddit. Pretty big deal. But you can't see the page because of an anti-adblock script.   So is hypothetical eBay a shitty website like hypothetical Google? Or is it more of the slick, pristeen, clean hypothetical Reddit?  The issue is that there is no way to know. And this is my issue. This has nothing to do with ads and everything to do with security. I guess that's downvote worthy"

And you're not getting it. You DO know plenty about the ad situation. If you go to most sites with Adblock on, they'll have every ad replaced with something. Cute pictures, big text block with the ""please disable adblock"". These do exist. You act like you can't see them with adblock. There are sites who have their own original drawings you only see in place of Adblock blank spaces. If you wanna do that, by all means.   Its basically buying a product that says ""some assembly required"". Which beats the alternative with shit like this site that cut everything out. This is like going to that company, wanting to buy said car, but the car is behind a special wall. Its an opaque wall and you can't see in the box at all. Still wanna buy that car? I'd just find a new one at a different dealership.   I doubt that guy's site had anything different than you could do with Reason or Fruity Loops.

Advertisers had their chance and they fucked up with popups, laggy flash ads, and redirects. You can't support ""nice"" ads without supporting the ad industry and the idea of ads- I want to see direct monetization (reddit gold etc) so I don't support ads.  It's like, if 99% of steak was rancid and 1% was great, some people would say ""We'd better all buy that 1% so eventually the great steak is more popular"".

A smaller website can't do that. By blocking ads, am I just screwing over the small guys?   My gut reaction is ""that's their problem"" but I really don't see a way for them to make money. And I definitely think they deserve to be able to make money, I can't disagree with that. There's that tipping service, flattr? Again, that's going to be inconsistent until you have a big userbase whereas ads will just generate revenue proportionate to pageviews.

Sure, it's easy for a Dave Grohl to say ""guys, fuck making money off CD sales, just go tour and so it for the love"". The guy is sitting on a pile of cash and is spitting in the face of up and coming musicians who are barely making it from paycheck to paycheck.  But I just had a think about online ads. Are they really that terrible? The only times I really, really get annoyed by ads is on porn websites and flash game sites, but purely because they are animated and flash all around. On the average website, it appears more like Google AdWords or smaller, targeted, yet unobtrusive headers and banners.   One idea that goes into a different direction is a service that would act as a central ""wallet"". It tracks domain visits and will take a tiny amount out of your wallet to pay to the websites. That makes adverts obsolete, but I'm sure there are lots and lots of problems with that idea."

There's a new annoyance now though that are just as bad as those ads and pop ups were 15 years ago.  Every major site I go to from HomeDepot to Microsoft to BestBuy, will hit me with 3 pop up modals that cannot be blocked by adblock.   Please take this survey to tell us about our website. I've taken one to finally tell them the popups were annoying and I got the same survey again the following week. Do you want to live chat? Eerily similar to the porn ads that were all over, these modals actually move around the screen trying to get you to talk to ""support"" Please sign up for our newsletter, website, whatever. Every time I follow a link to Twitter, site is blocked by a sign up window I have to close. Some sites don't even let you read it without signing up.

I have at times pirated an album or movie but much like when I go over the speed limit on the road or don't pay my road tax on time, I know what I'm doing is wrong. Companies don't have to give you anything for cheaper, they don't have to price their electronic books the same as their physical. They are under no obligation to price things in a way that adheres to your moral code of pricing and thinking that anyone that doesn't pirate is a ""sucker"" is the typical 'the world owes me something' kind of attitude that I think is way to prevalent amongst the online community."

Not all theft necessarily results in people being ""locked up in prison""; if I steal a chocolate bar from a shop I'm committing a crime but it will most likely result in a warning from the police. Nonetheless, it is still theft.   That's why I'm asking you exactly what you think piracy is if it is not theft?

I already pointed out how in the vast majority of rapes it doesn't work because the victim trusts the perpetrator.   First off, if I don't believe in rape culture then I don't think it does that, on account of me rejecting its existence. So you're assuming a premise I don't necessarily agree with to reach a conclusion you know I don't agree with.  Secondly, people generally don't care if you leave early, don't get completely shit-faced, or whatever because you're trying to be careful. Hell, if a girl tries to walk home late at night most guys will offer to walk with her.    The article author pointed to rape culture to explain some phenomenon that was encountered. Even without acknowledging rape culture is a thing these phenomenon still happen.   I was obviously being hyperbolic to make a point. I don't know why you're taking what was clearly a joke so literally, while simultaneously missing the point of it.     You're telling me to stop being hyperbolic and then use the ""it's just a joke"" excuse to get yourself out of doing the same.   Didn't you just acknowledge the fact that most women are raped by people they know, and not strangers in bars? By your own admission, this worry is illogical.   In fact, it is given the evidence. That is the problem with telling women to ""be careful"". Although other things do happen in these situations.  College campuses might be the exception to what I said though.  Anyways, nice conversation but I gotta long trip ahead of me."

Whether they get drunk or not is inconsequential to the fact that they often get raped by someone they know. Someone they feel safe with.   Considering it applies to a large percentage of rapes yes, it is. Besides that, it was meant as an example of how telling people to protect themselves does work.    I already pointed out how in the vast majority of rapes it doesn't work because the victim trusts the perpetrator.   You can protect yourself while trusting someone, as I have already pointed out.    The article author pointed to rape culture to explain some phenomenon that was encountered. Even without acknowledging rape culture is a thing these phenomenon still happen.   Not really.    You're telling me to stop being hyperbolic and then use the ""it's just a joke"" excuse to get yourself out of doing the same.   There is a difference between me using a joke to illustrate a point and you using buzzwords to deflect it.    In fact, it is given the evidence.

I thought the top comment and top reply to that comment was spot on. Is it an impossible demand for you not to leave your front door wide open to deter burglaries?   ""Impossible demands""?!  It's simple, you say we meet in public. If the person pushes to meet in private, YOU DON'T GO OUT WITH THEM!  This isn't impossible! Normal men understand you are trying to reduce the risk, anyone who doesn't... It's a red flag women! Don't argue with them, cut them the fuck loose and keep looking for a normal guy!

SubredditDrama,3dw9ic,IvanLu,0,Mon Jul 20 13:28:41 2015 UTC,'rape culture' is literally in the title.  Twice.
SubredditDrama,3dw9ic,WorseThanHipster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:00 2015 UTC,So what? That doesn't disprove the point that exercising caution does not equate to endorsing rape culture which MissP appears to be suggesting.
SubredditDrama,3dw9ic,IvanLu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"It's always a tough question.  The language of 'common sense' and 'caution' are common tropes in victim blaming and dismissal of rape culture (not saying the words mean that).  This is actually gone over in the comic, wherin' the character is assaulted in somoene else's home, and is met with 'why did you go home alone with him?'  That sort of questioning happens very very often, especially by people that are there to 'help' such as college administrators or police officers.    It is actually a key component of the theory behind rape culture.  Rape culture is not about a culture that endorses rape; 'Perpetuating rape culture' does not imply anyone is pro-rape.  This is the most common misinterpretation of the words 'rape culture'.  Rape culture is about a culture that enables rapists, intentionally or not, through various mechanisms such as the one I just described.  No one is arguing against any use of common sense, nor does anyone equate it with endorsing rape culture.  Those are both extremes and frankly, straw men.  *Edit: I'd also like to point out that the equating 'not trusting a man on the first date' with 'common sense' approach is endorsing the idea the all men are potentially rapists.  Most men wouldn't refuse to go to a woman's home after a first date (out of fear), while women are all but 'expected' not to go home with a man on a first date.  They call it 'common sense' while at the same time complaining that woman treat them right off that bat as if they're a potential threat."
SubredditDrama,3dw9ic,WorseThanHipster,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:53 2015 UTC,"This is actually gone over in the comic, wherin' the character is assaulted in somoene else's home, and is met with 'why did you go home alone with him?' That sort of questioning happens very very often, especially by people that are there to 'help' such as college administrators or police officers.   How is this any different from ""Why didn't you lock your front door?"" Should we start shaming police inspectors who pose that question to burgled homeowners? Does this amount to victim blaming as well?   Rape culture is about a culture that enables rapists, intentionally or not, through various mechanisms such as the one I just described.   Unfortunately, I think the term rape culture is now just an epithet, much like MRA/TRP/SJW. It's used to label rather than diagnose the problem. In fact RAINN, the largest anti-sexual assault organisation in the US stated it quite clearly here:   “In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture” for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime,” said the letter to the task force from RAINN’s president, Scott Berkowitz, and vice president for public policy, Rebecca O’Connor.   Further down RAINN basically reiterated the notion behind #notallmen, that research shows college rapes are committed by a small number of perpetrators.    RAINN’s recommendations pointed to research that suggests that more than 90% of college rapes are committed by about 3% of college men (reliable research about female perpetrators is harder to come by). Based on that pattern of assaults by repeat offenders, RAINN stressed the importance of treating sexual assaults on campuses as the serious crimes that they are, and ensuring that there are meaningful consequences.   No one is arguing against any use of common sense, nor does anyone equate it with endorsing rape culture. Those are both extremes and frankly, straw men.   Why not address MissP's arguments instead of sidetracking them and stating grand banalities? MissP argued in the thread that women couldn't exercise their use of common sense because society presumably shames women for doing so. Do you agree with her?   *Edit: I'd also like to point out that the equating 'not trusting a man on the first date' with 'common sense' approach is endorsing the idea the all men are potentially rapists. Most men wouldn't refuse to go to a woman's home after a first date (out of fear), while women are all but 'expected' not to go home with a man on a first date. They call it 'common sense' while at the same time complaining that woman treat them right off that bat as if they're a potential threat.   Who is 'they' here? Are they widespread? Do most or all men complain that way or are you overgeneralising the behaviour of some men? Methinks you are doing the latter. The idea is that if you don't feel safe, don't do it.  Don't think this is particularly hard to understand or follow."

The pea-sized blob in the center of the CPU, followed by sticking the heatsink on it method is generally the go-to, but it's somewhat outdated these days and not necessarily optimal.  It was the optimal method years ago when the important parts of most CPUs were a square-shaped chip in the dead center of the thing, but that's not necessarily the case in some modern CPUs: http://i.imgur.com/FyFMhst.jpg  For that reason, the pea-shaped blob was replaced with the rice-sized blob for some CPUs since the more elongated rice grain shape is more likely to cover the elongated chip shape.  The pea blob method ends up being almost identical performance-wise to any other method though so it doesn't really matter to anybody who isn't an overclocking enthusiast."

SubredditDrama,3dtzr1,Jgold101,2,Sun Jul 19 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"There's still no proper consensus on the proper way but the pea in the middle approach is the easiest. You need something rigid and flat to get a good spread yourself but you run less risk of missing the corners. I prefer the pea approach since I don't overclock so I really don't need optimized cooling efficiency and it's just so much easier. Thermal paste tends to be sticky and annoying to mess around with.   Also, yes the entire point of a TIM (Thermal Interface Material) is to conduct heat. Specifically, to conduct heat better than air. As most people know, air is a rather good insulator. It conducts heat but not very well. We can put some numbers on it. Air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 W/m K, copper has 401 W/m K, aluminium has 204 W/m K and most thermal pastes have 0.2-2 W/m K. So not even close to the thermal conductivity of metal but still an order of magnitude or two better than air. The ideal solution would be to solder the IHS and the cooler together so it's all metal but that is highly impractical. So a paste or grease is used because it's much better than nothing."

I always use an old credit card, which makes it fairly easy to get a very even spread, and I've always had excellent temps this way. (I do overclock)  But the pea drop approach is more hassle-free obviously, and it works just as well according to most people, so it's really down to personal preference."

It is a good mathematical discussion topic.   http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.to.0.power.html  I think the general modern consensus is 00 = 1, however."

That's fantasy from a book, c'mon I thought we were over this...) and have since taken cover in Israel, using their infiltrated people to control sectors of the US government to fund their shitty nation to kill the real Semitic jews and not the fake-o Obamaland Ashkenazi Rothschild banker ""jews"" (e.g. they glued on some twirly side burns). Basically, ironically of all, they have managed to once again use the Jews as a scapegoat for their horrific crimes, and the easily divisible people that fall into hate movements like the KKK and white supremacists who then engage in warfare on their behalf. It's quite nefarious and conspiratorial. But let me ask you this, excuse the apeal but assuming I was right about all this, would it really surprise you that I come to the conclusion that ultimately, the Nazis are behind this? Spefically the same Nazis behind the Holocaust (which wasn't about ethnic cleansing but was a sick human experimentation program, Japan is also guilty of this. America is too though far as I know we never went far as they did, well there's at least not as many bodies), those Nazis, that THEY did 9/11? That THEY are responsible for false flag attacks, for pushing for the current police state in the US? I mean come on, they're fucking Nazis   REAL TALK.

""True free speech policies"" suffer from Gresham's Law when it comes to online communities like Reddit. They just aren't built for it for many important (and difficult to solve) reasons, such as online sockpuppeting, and the bad and the ugly drive the good completely out. Then you get /r/conspiracy.

SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,missbombshell,32,Sun Jul 19 01:31:35 2015 UTC,"tbf, this is a perfect opportunity for WotC to put a policy in place to ban violent and sex offenders from competitions (At least banning them from going to higher rankings, like pro-player status and beyond). They most likely didn't have the policy in place because they optimistically thought the only focus for players would be on the game but, seeing as we are humans, there are cases in which the little niche that MtG is isn't always as safe as other may think.  It'll be hard, of course, but that shouldn't discourage them from trying to make the community a safer place for everyone."

Prominent player magic the gathering card player Zach Jesse gets a high placing at one of the most important magic tournaments. A writer named Drew Levin points out on twitter that Zach Jesse is a convicted sex offender. Looking back, almost 10 years ago Zach Jesse anally and vaginally raped his friend who was passed out after drinking alcohol. To get out of a conviction of rape, Jesse pleaded guilty to a less charge of sexual battery, serving only a couple months in prison which a lot of people attribute to the affluence of his parents. He was allowed back into college right after on a scholarship after writing a paper on his involvement. the small subreddit was made as somewhat of a containment zone after TRP/MRA types (gamergaters tried to ""lend their aid"") flooded the front page of the main magic sub, and the offshoot was made to divert attention."

His parents helped get him into a better facility that was barely 'punishment' and not at all real 'rehabilitation'. They talk about how lucky both he and his victim are because alcohol is the real danger here and they could have both died from drinking and that is the real lesson people should learn. It's basically just been constant reinforcement of the idea that what he did wasn't that big of a deal and that he doesn't need to face more serious consequences."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,duckduckCROW,22,Sun Jul 19 09:10:49 2015 UTC,Lol and remember how he said he was probably rejected because it was the same time the Rolling Stones article about that rape came out?  This guy takes no responsibility for anything and that's what really showed it.

This should really make the banning even more justifiable and understandable for the people who don't get it: He's essentially saying he has no control over anything. Things like rape just happen. Oops. Not his fault. He can't control things.   If this is what he is basically arguing at this point (and ever since), how the fuck does anyone think he isn't a danger to others?"

SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,duckduckCROW,3,Sun Jul 19 11:41:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's probably because a lot of law schools, especially shitty ones, just hand out scholarships to everyone because the price of tution is so ridiculously inflated anyway. It's like Macy's marking up clothes 30% and then giving you ""30% off"" in a ""sale"" that never seems to end.  The school also doesn't really care if he ever gets admitted to the bar. They already got his money and can just throw him into a job from the school that they use to inflate their 9-months-after-employment statistics before kicking him to the curb."

Because it sounds like $30,000 total, and the 3 year cost of attendance (including living expenses) is $208,801.  In either case they report that their average scholarship award is around $23,000. I'm just saying that the school's award of this scholarship was more likely due to them handing out scholarships to almost everyone (97 out of 131 students) rather than it being in support of him personally or what he wrote in his essay.  Like I said, the legal market sucks and law schools are just out for your money. I doubt they put a single ounce of thought into whether he could actually get bar certified."

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Magic The Gathering and Wizards of the Coast are BUSINESSES and they do not want to be associated with anything that will cost them money. Allowing a well-known pro player who is also a known rapist to continue to play in competitions = Bad PR because now tons of people will know what competitions he's at and less people will most likely show up to those specific competitions. Less people going to competitions = Less people playing = Less cards being bought = Less $$$.  It's also a safety issue since he would most likely be harassed by other players at events, so this indirectly protects him.  And finally, he's a fucking rapist holy shit. There is a reason the sex offender registry exists and not a ""drug dealer registry"" or a ""grand theft auto registry"".

Chapin and then looking up following reports on Edward Romesburg's cause of death, I've only found that they initially suspected an accidental or intentional overdose (specifically an ecstasy overdose) and that, while ecstasy od was ruled out, they did investigate it and finally conclude that it was a suicide. Though I'm still trying to find the specific substance used. So no murder at all. Though that sure does sound more exciting.  Also, Chapin has been publishing articles on how words mean things and the environment is toxic and people need to stop throwing around words like ""rape"" and ""faggot"" at tournaments for awhile now. So he'll either be called a murderer or a SJW (same diff, right?), regardless."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,kurashu89,5,Sun Jul 19 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"A piece of info you may not be aware of is that Patrick Chapin basically got off because the key witness against him was murdered right before the trial.   A witness died. The idea that he was murdered, or murdered by Chapin is wild speculation."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,missbombshell,38,Sun Jul 19 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Aren't most convicted murderers in jail for life/a really long time? Because, reasonably, the law sees them as a danger to the public (why MtG members don't see this with sex offenders baffles me).    Maybe if he was charged with manslaughter, there would be more debate depending on the situation."

The M:TCG sub was freaking out about it a couple of weeks back. Not sure how they managed to attract so many naysayers already."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,ReNoLuK,33,Sun Jul 19 00:39:22 2015 UTC,the magictcg sub was massively pro-that-guy partly due to mods taking his side and bringing out the iron fist

SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,SJHalflingRanger,7,Sun Jul 19 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"well the general idea was to just bury the whole thing. After the subreddit was made, like 6 moderators just got up and left. the demographic has changed consistently, when it first was made, people were more on jesses side than wizards decision. Nowadays its just kept up and visited by MRA/TRP fuck women types."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,khanfusion,4,Sun Jul 19 00:56:27 2015 UTC,The mra/gg/trp folks don't go there (thus the worst rape apologists get down votes). It's a very low traffic sub so brigades have no incentive going there as it's not a venue toboush their agenda. It's mostly mtg that are still outrage either by the ban or by the support that jesse got. It's more moderate than the original threads as the brigades are gone.
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,SJHalflingRanger,5,Sun Jul 19 18:34:21 2015 UTC,I'm just very surprised by the voting I guess.

SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,kratistos,3,Sun Jul 19 06:52:41 2015 UTC,The point of that sub is to keep the posts on this topic from taking over the main Magic the Gathering sub. Better to let the nutters have their own peanut paradise.
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,Bhangbhangduc,4,Sun Jul 19 10:14:26 2015 UTC,That sub was made by the magictcg mods to divert conversation from the main one.
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,TempusThales,15,Sun Jul 19 02:23:42 2015 UTC,I was wondering how an anti rape comment got upvoted and then I realised it wasn't the magic sub.
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,Myliobatidae,25,Sun Jul 19 09:55:40 2015 UTC,I really don't believe this. Imagine a prominent neo-nazi starts doing well in GPs. I think Jesse's banning totally sets up a precedent that would reasonably lead to this guy fearing for his DCI number as well. I've seen many people who support Jesse's banning bite the bullet and say that Wizards should ban known neonazis or racists or whatever. So I don't think anyone on any side of this issue really only thinks this will apply to violent felons.   Maybe it is because I'm German and we usually have a slightly different view on what to do with neo nazis but it's hard for me to view that as anything negative.
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,Zorkamork,11,Sun Jul 19 09:42:40 2015 UTC,"Ja, oder?  It took me a while to understand why anybody would have a problem with banning Nazis from your tournaments."
SubredditDrama,3dsbxm,Zeeker12,9,Sun Jul 19 13:53:35 2015 UTC,I feel like that case is so specific that the poster of that post either knows a prominent neo=nazi or is one himself.

The upvoted continued to be upvoted and the down continued to go down.   I've seen threads where the down/up votes get brigaded so hard from SRD that they switch directions.   I feel like the site needs to figure out a way to combat that. Cause trying to tell thousands of people not to vote apparently isn't working.

It's the weekend users who can go either way. I've seen a lot of high income, high stress professionals in their twenties do their weekend coke binge then act perfectly respectable otherwise.

The good parents I knew that partied a lot kept it out of their house, and usually they only went out a few times a year (6 or less).   Like it or not, having a kid means your life has to change.

Anyway that comic that was posted was old, I recognize it from the last few years of SG-1 I think unless I'm confusing it with all the other kawaii comics made at the time by the teen girl fanbase.

But I also don't get how anyone can argue that is not aimed at teen girls. The fact that it's two girls gossiping about a boy who exists within those strips simply as a romantic interest for a girl implies the target audience is girls. Teen is implied by the fact that they are acting like children in the drawings rather than the grown ass adults they were in the tv series. The whole ""omg this boy looks so cute but I can't say so because I'm too shy and embarrassed to talk to cute boys!"" is something people usually grow out of by the time they've completed high school, and college, and medical school, and rise to the rank of Major in the United States Air Force.

Black Americans are way more criminal and violent than any other group in America, yet they are always portrayed as noble victims by media. Black Americans are chosen over equally or more qualified individuals of other ethnicities for jobs and college admissions in the name of 'diversity' and Affirmative Action. Black Americans who can't earn can depend on welfare while black africans just starve and die.  Their bad condition is due to their own shortcomings.

What they do say is that ""it is literally impossible for him to win"" rants are silly. This is politics. Frontrunners fuck up. No-name candidates come from behind. It's unpredictable. To that end, the most important line you gave is wrong:   And the fact that only one insurgent campaign has ever worked, and that was Obama   McGovern was definitely an insurgent, and he won the nomination. He was fucked by his VP choice among other things (D operatives not wanting to lose control of the party to the New Left) in the general, but he won the nomination.  You're writing as if the polls tell all, months before polls have much meaning."

No one thought a black dude with a weird name had a chance against Clinton either.   Is it likely? No. Is it utterly impossible? No.
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,Hammedatha,-9,Sun Jul 19 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"Like what, though? Nobody's ever made an issues based argument that I know of. The reasons seem to be:  1) He's a socialist!!!!11  2) Polls show he's not well known among minorities!  3) He doesn't have billions of dollars like Hillary does!  4) At this extremely early stage, polls show he trails Hillary!  None of these things imply shit all, really. Candidates can and do surmount these sorts of things easily (at least in quality, if not quantity - it IS a large poll deficit), all the time. What pols succeed or fail on often comes down to issues, which nobody touches when it comes down to Sanders. They just mindlessly repeat 1-4 over and over, even as the Hillary poll advantage shrinks and Sanders makes loot from small donors."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,jackrousseau,23,Sun Jul 19 14:11:06 2015 UTC,Socialism won't win in the general and you know that.  Money matters and he's a drop in the bucket compared to Hillary.  Name recognition matters more and he's even further behind on that. That and his complete and total lack of legislative success and a pretty lame Washington resume make him the longest shot with an active following online (where voter turnout is a crap shoot at best.   And his stance on issues is the first thing anyone brings up. He's a volatile leftist equivalent of the Tea Party who would lead to far more obstruction and gridlock than anyone else.
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,AOBCD-8663,12,Sun Jul 19 14:31:35 2015 UTC,Makes loot from small donors? Which candidate do you think will have more money by a landslide?  Polling isn't a guessing game.

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,jackrousseau,5,Sun Jul 19 14:51:58 2015 UTC,Except making it that far and winning an election are two completely different things. Look at how many people have crashed and burned in the GOP in the last two elections during the campaigns.

It's not mindless repetition, its a substantive list of factors that show exactly why Sanders is very unlikely to win."

Even just a few days before the election, polls are often inaccurate gauges of the winner, fraught and very often misleading. But now, about a year before the election? Polls are pretty damn close to worthless.   That's not to say Sanders is likely to win, he is definitely the underdog, but that doesn't change the fact that polls this early are a terrible gauge of anything other than general popularity entering into the ring.  Every single election year, people bring up early polls as if they matter, and every year, I have to have this conversation with someone.... sigh, it gets old, man.... it gets real old..."

The two party system is bullshit and liberals are never going to turn it around in any serious way (although a higher minimum wage, maybe some free tuition would be worth voting for).  But, all that being said, the current arguments people are using here are really bad. Does he have a low probability of success? Yeah. Does he have like a 0.001% chance? Hell no, it's much higher than that. There have been so many ridiculous political upsets in history. Worse, it's the primary we're talking about, so discouraging anyone who isn't voting for the front runner would logically lead to the most mainstream and elite-friendly candidate winning literally every time. This isn't a Nader thing at all."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,YungSnuggie,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Like?   George McGovern in '72 is a good one. He lost the general due to a lot of causes (mostly beyond his control) but he won the nomination. Also remember that Bill Clinton was a fucking nobody at the beginning of the 1992 cycle.   Especially post-citizens united, whoever spends the most wins.   That's definitely not true. Money matters when one candidate doesn't have enough to make themselves known; it has quickly diminishing returns above that. Ask Carly Fiorina: she tried to buy her way into a Senate seat and burned her way through a significant amount of her own personal fortune (lol).   Nobody has ever come from 40 points and billions of dollars behind to beat a machine like Clinton.   It's also true that the giant billion dollar machines are very new, giving us a small sample size.

We are currently in the part of the cycle where all the loonies have their time to shine, before primaries happen and people start realizing how incompetent everyone is.  Right now, Donald Trump is leading the GOP.  And he isn't going to win.  No one expects him to get the ticket.    Remember the last election cycle, every GOP candidate had a few weeks in the number one slot, but they all fell through so that the only sensible candidate, Romney, survived.    In other words, don't take polls too seriously at this point.  I predict that Hilary won't lead the second-comer by 40 points wihtin a few months.  Either sanders will rise all the way up to 20-30 percent, or another candidate will.  But Hillary will probably gain serious competition from her party soon.  It's worth noting that while Sanders isn't doing so well in Iowa, SC and Florida, he is quickly closing in on Hill in the most important primary state: New Hampshire.  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html  If he keeps doing well here in NH, the news will keep talking about him (because political news is obsessed with NH), and he will rise in stature in other states accordingly.  And if he wins the primary (outside chance), that will be very bad news for Clinton."

As it stands, while she is a democrat and has some liberal policies, she's far too much of a moderate for my liking. She's pro-business when the businesses need more regulation. She's a bit Laissez Faire in her economics. She's willing to compromise on social reforms. And she isn't putting much focus on rights for the downtrodden.   Sanders is putting the focus on all of that, and while Clinton currently isn't responding, she will be forced to at some point, and she will be forced to agree with Sanders, or she's going to be very unpopular with her base.  This is not an election cycle for compromise. There are no moderate republicans who might vote democrat if Hillary leans to the right just far enough. The republicans hate the very name democrat, and will never vote for anyone with that brand. So, the proper course of action is to rile up the base and the independents, and to get them voting for what they like, which is social and economic reforms, and rights for the middle and working classes. Bernie can and probably will force Hillary into doing that, which will help her (or his, if he wins) odds."

The jig is up, no need to hide it anymore, lets just come out and state our intent and see if we can rally whats left of the base.

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,mrsamsa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think that they are very important actually - first, to know how to focus on where to broadcast your message and what you need to do (for example, how much ground can be made up just by getting more name recognition). In addition, having a decently high polling can help bring more people in."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,matgopack,7,Mon Jul 20 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"Except Sanders isn't harmful to their cause - just the opposite. Shouting down the one candidate who's most likely to actually listen and respond to your concerns isn't good strategy. To get a proper leftist candidate elected, you need more groups than #blacklivesmatter: you need the pipefitters' union locals, you need the local LGBTQIA groups, you need the liberal churches, i.e.  you need to be running a big tent. It's not hypocritical to let everyone air their concerns in an orderly manner, or to let a candidate speak after you've spent time yelling at him."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,thisisstephen,4,Sun Jul 19 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really speaking about Sanders in particular but more just the idea that it's bad to criticise people who broadly agree with you. I get that sometimes you have to make compromises when it comes to furthering your goal and the goal of others, but people seem to say it just when someone is being criticised by someone within their own broad group.  For example, sometimes a prominent feminist will say something silly about trans* people, so the feminist community will largely criticise them and ask them for an apology, learn more about the topic, etc, and they'll get accused of ""eating their own"" or ""turning on each other"". It just seems really weird to think that something that they view as a serious problem (transphobia in my example) should be ignored even though it could easily be addressed and fixed.  With Sanders, I don't know a whole lot about him but from what I've heard his main plan to address problems in society is to try to fix economic issues and (I think) his idea is that all other social issues will flow from there. Whereas the black community is asking him to address racial issues because obviously fixing economic issues isn't going to fix the majority of racial (or other social) issues and that's clearly what they care about."

When minority groups peacefully protest like this or even when they start rioting, the point is that they've tried asking nicely for a long time and nothing has come of it.   Maybe they will lose allies, maybe they'll gain some. But the one thing for certain is that they weren't being listened to anyway so they had nothing to lose in their eyes."

That's not to say that Sanders doesn't need to up his game on minority engagement and deal with issues like racism and sexism as well - he is certainly lacking in that respect - but there is a definite tendency among certain Clinton supporters to get too caught up in the minutiae of identity politics so they miss how these fit into the bigger picture of liberation."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,MackDaddyVelli,6,Tue Jul 21 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly.  I'm generally a pretty big fan of Sanders, but I'll be the first to admit that the guy isn't exactly doing a good job of talking about minority issues like racism and sexism.  He called it out briefly at a speech in Iowa last night, but he really needs to incorporate it into his platform on a larger scale if he's going to appeal to anybody but middle class white men.  On a certain level it makes sense that he's more or less ignored them until now.  Sanders' platform has been running on a very neo-Marxist platform in terms of framing a lot of his rhetoric around economic class conflict.  But it's high damned time he pull his head out of the sand and realize that there are other social conflicts present in American society that need to be talked about and need to be dealt with, and he'll never win the black vote or the women's vote or the Latino vote without talking about those issues."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,DuvalEaton,6,Sun Jul 19 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"Well that is a bit of a schism in leftist politics really. I mean many people such as marxists and other leftists schools of thought will argue that ultimately stuff like racial and ethnic conflicts stem from economic inequality and that if that issue is rectified, then the other conflicts will disappear. On the other hand you have many people in the identity-politics left who argue that if not at the forefront, then there should be at least equal time given to both more basic economic issues and minority issues.  It seems to me the Sanders is more of the school of thought of the former, and the fact that he is ofc an old cis white man probably doesn't help with the messaging heh. Ultimately it seems that Sanders should probably do more to at least reach out to the identity politics side of the spectrum to buttress his progressive support, though it would be kinda ironic if this ends up helping Clinton since she arguably has had a more checkered pass with these issues than Bernie has heh."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,subheight640,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:18:39 2015 UTC,"The more Sanders talks about minority issues, the less white men will want to vote for Sanders.   IMO there's a big reason why Sanders is so popular on white, male dominated Reddit, whereas Clinton, who votes nearly the same way as Sanders 95% of the time, isn't. Identity politics...  The more Sanders talks about minority issues, the more he ""shows"" that he cannot identify with the issues of white man, and that he is taking sides on racial politics in favor of the minorities.   Hell, many Reddit libertarians have admitted to their love of Sanders ,despite the fact that Sander's ideology is seemingly completely counter to right libertarian politics and the political polar opposite of Ron Paul.   I mean, how could this be...??? I think it comes down to identity politics. Sander's affiliations are clean enough to be trusted by reddit's core demographic, whereas Obama's and Hilary's affiliations are not. The actual actions these politicians have done are ultimately less important than who they are affiliated with."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,seanziewonzie,13,Sun Jul 19 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"You did, I believe. The point he is making is concerned with the fact that Sanders never talks about minority issues.  Sanders policies are much less libertarian than Clinton's, and- indeed- help minorities more. So why is Sanders more popular even among the libertarian sphere? Because Sanders doesn't talk about race like Clinton does (during this specific election), and so the overwhelmingly white libertarian/moderate circles don't feel uncomfortable.  The user is saying Bernie knows this and has tailored his campaign to have that specific effect. I don't agree nor do I disagree."

Also Clinton is far more likely to send troops off the war, where minorities and the poor are disproportionally represented.   Keep in mind just because they had similar voting records in the Senate does not mean they will use the Presidency in the same manner.   Also why not try and speak with him instead of going with the intention to disrupt?

Don't get me wrong he's probably my favorite current candidate from either party, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

Blocking highways and disrupting traffic (and they did let emergency vehicles through whenever possible, to my knowledge - didn't Chris Christie have someone die in an ambulance with his political revenge bridge closure?) is a pretty good tactic. The general rule is that you have to credibly threaten elites with enough damage that it's worth their while to just fix whatever is fucking you over.  It's easy to be annoyed if you already have all the rights the protesters are asking for. It's a lot harder to imagine living a life without said rights and wondering what you'd do in their place."

Borderline cases are usually swept under the rug.   the answer is quite a few places   After Ferguson started things, of course - none of that would have happened if people just did nothing. Police militarization wasn't in the national discourse, and neither was police brutality against minorities, really. The riots and the ridiculous response changed all that.   Some of those results include driving out business owners and more affluent residents.   So maybe political leaders should make reforms before they're forced to by the threat of riots and economic losses? If you're desperate then you do what you can to make an impact.

Of course there isn't and likely will never will be evidence either way.  The thing is that Clinton can't directly attack Sanders on economic issues without enraging progressives, so their campaign has to use surrogates. Call Claire McCaskill to say ""nobody will vote for a socialist"", tell your staffers to anonymously mention ""Sanders is bad with minorities"" to every reporter in sight, and so on. BlackLivesMatter is a pretty amorphous, distributed organization, so it wouldn't be too hard to convince a group of them to ruin a Sanders and O'Malley event either. Of course there's also the fact that O'Malley's policies really contributed to the Baltimore situation (fuck that guy) and Sanders has focused on class issues without a whole lot of specifics regarding minorities (although he did very well at La Raza recently too!), so it is entirely plausibly just some angry protesters taking orders from no one.  I remember when Eliot Spitzer tried to get back into politics recently, running for NYC Comptroller and some ""feminist groups"" popped up out of nowhere to bash him for hiring a prostitute. He ended up losing the Democratic nomination. This is important because Spitzer, whatever his personal failings, actually came down pretty hard on corrupt Wall Street bankers, and made a seriously large amount of financially powerful enemies. It was a weird coincidence that some surprisingly well-funded feminists spontaneously decided that hiring a prostitute some years prior made one of the better American financial regulators a horrible fit for the job.  You can easily get labeled a conspiracy theorist for talking about these sorts of tactics, because only rarely do you catch candidates in the act of carrying out dirty tricks campaigns. But they happen a lot in the US. It's pretty bad."

This was on the front page within the last week, and it has links to CNN and Fox polls that show that he is polling incredibly low with them.  So yeah, maybe it is an ""opposition tactic"", but it is true, and more importantly his support(or more specifically lack thereof) from minorities does matter, and his supporters should be concerned about that."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,lurker093287h,9,Sun Jul 19 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"That was interesting, I am not super familiar with Sanders but he seems like a social democrat basically on economic issues, if he does get a chance to legislate policy this would be pretty unambiguously better for the lives of most black and Latin people, because of racial wage disparity and other things his policies are more likely to effect these groups disproportionately, so it's pretty interesting that Clinton is polling higher in those areas when she is somewhat to the right of him on economic issues.   I am going to randomly speculate about this: I  think that Clinton has more or less inherited the political alliance of her husband and iirc this involved the various soft racial political blocks and political machines that he was managed to knit together in his run for president, this could be influencing things directly or indirectly with name recognition etc,  perhaps also identity politics plays a role in that even though sanders would be better for most people on economic issues (which seem central to some majority of voters) Clinton is making right noises and striking the right tone etc. It could also be basic name recognition or policy awareness where Sanders is based in a particular state and isn't that prominent in the urban areas that have large ethnic minorities."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,rstcp,18,Sun Jul 19 12:35:24 2015 UTC,"Sanders has like sub 30% name recognition among minorities. He polls low because no one knows who he is. It's possible that he would still be behind Clinton if he was more widely known, but we can't know for sure since that would require a reality in which he is known better."
SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,jackrousseau,3,Sun Jul 19 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree (and I think I mentioned that in some of those random speculations), but I think that if people knew his name and what he wants to do vs what Clinton wants to do then he would obviously win, but getting people to know that is a different story."

SubredditDrama,3dsx7o,Feldsteinrothmanberg,5,Sun Jul 19 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"There was a really good interview with Doug Henwood and Adolph Reed  (some of my favourite socialist curmudgeons you can download it here ctrl+f adolph if it doesn't link directly) that I listened to the other day that kind of reminded me of this kind of stuff.   A quote    How the issue is defined in public discussion, it makes me wonder what the ultimate political ramifications of this issue are going to be, what the response is gonna be. It's a tad conspiratorial but it makes me wonder what ideological work heightened public attention to this issue is likely to perform. I don't mean to suggest that there is a deep conspiratorial department in the bourgeoisie that makes stuff like this up, they aren't that smart, but it is the case that there are sort of deep thinking elements of the bipartisan ruling class that are prepared to work overtime...to produce socially acceptable definitions of the natiure of these problems [that] are system maintaining instead of system challenging.   Henwood: (paraphrasing)...we're seeing the mobilisation of the nation and the Salon liberals to go after Bernie sanders, I'm not the biggest sanders fan in the world but he's bringing up some issues that I think both of us find important, and there going after him for not embracing the black lives matters movement, [and] I think it was Stephen gillers in the nation yesterday going on about 'criticisms of Hillary Clinton are just anxieties about powerful woman'...    [the actual quote is ""*today, as in 1994, criticism of Hillary’s ethics is a reaction to the rise of women in political and professional life. A lot of people still have a problem with powerful women*""]    ...we're seeing these tropes used to defend this politician [Clinton] who's at the heart of American power and has been for decades. Some how sanders is the reactionary in this model.    I've given Bernie some money...there is a possibility that some trade union interests and others might condense around this movement around the candidacy and might start a strategic discussion of the kind that I've been arguing we need to have that will extend beyond however long  Bernie's in the race, so in that sense he could be like a rabbit in a 5,000 meter race. That said I've been kind of taken aback by some of the...de-facto race baiting of him...I was struck, around 2008 I was an officer in the AAUP and I spent a lot of time among my boomer feminist coigues  and was really kind of surprised at how much the support of Clinton (v obama) came from that demographic...on explicitly identiaran grounds,  people would say ""I'm backing her because she's a woman and that's my identity, "" and granted that is what blacks and others were doing with Obama too right, but I think it says something about the overall debasement of the politics...I've never been a Hillary basher...but the way this thing is going to play out is the way it's always going to play out, nomatter what Bernie does we're gonna wind up being called on to vote for her as the lesser evil because republicans are more dangerous and this time that might be right   I'm just kind of stunned both at the kind of crudely gender based defensiveness about Clinton, but even more that the way to protect here is to attack sanders on race grounds. As if his calls for economic redistribution wouldn't have much greater impact on many more black people than any of the respected racial voices that write on alternet would call for.    I can't imagine what reforms of the Policing system in the US would have more effect on the lives of black Americans than the kind of redistribution that sanders is talking about.    Yeah...To me that speaks eloquently fo the class cocoon within which all of this conversation occurs. I mean the nation MSNBC, the new republic, a lot of the American Prospect (although they tend to be a little better than others), and all of that stuff that comes from 'the internet fund-raising left' as I sometimes call it and the black studies based blogosphere. It seems to me that it's tantamount to a confession of a class politics"

You don't have to be the ""don't make a fuss"" type to see this in action.  edit- A lot of activists on the US left are so suspicious of party politics that they are good at alienating them. Steve Israel (D-NY), chair of DCCC, the hill committee for the Dems infamously tried to reach out to Occupy folk & got rebuffed. This was when several congressmen were making statements in support of OWS. Plus more senior party figures remember the massive losses they had when ceded ground to certain activist groups (see jackrousseau's earlier mention of McGovern '72).  edit2electricboogaloo- Reading transcripts, I may be laying blame too heavy on the protesters.

Do you think that some relaxation of 'stress' policing in poor urban areas and prosecuting police who kill people, plus maybe some more black councillors and police people are that much more important or will affect more poor black people than allowing the  government to negotiate drug prices, universal pre-Kindergarten, increased Protection for workers (including environmental and job security) some kind of reduction of tuition fees at all public Universities, a huge infrastructure jobs program and a 'green New Deal' and a full employment Act,  a medicare Buy-In,  and the expansion of Social Security Benefits.   I mean even if you do, those things would more or less solve the problem of stress policing without having to confront it so directly (with little in the way of structural results), because more jobs and rising wages basically means the end of the collapsed urban ghetto, full employment essentially means the end of mass incarceration as a means to 'manage' poverty and the kind of revenue collection policies that provoke hatred of the police, universal pre-kindergarten, full employment and an expansion of social security basically ends 'workfare' policies.

Also, I think the severity of traffic here is blown out of proportion, at least in regards to local only as i dont have much experience with other cities traffic strengths and weaknesses. As someone who has been driving since the late 80's my commute hasn't changed that much. A bus from university to downtown takes pretty much the same amount of time today as it did in the 90's. Traveling to Redmond is also the same. I just think as a native I've always avoided 405 and i5 during rush.

LA is bad. Horrible. Being crowded on Lincoln and taking an hour to move a mile is harsh. Taking 3+ hours to cross town is worse. 2 hours to get away from LAX to the 405 is hell.   Seattle occasionally rivals those times, without having anywhere near the throughput, and that's the issue. That's why I don't consider it overstated. We're horrible at moving large numbers of people."

And unlike in say NYC or DC or hell even Vancouver where I can just take a subway over here in Seattle I have to either drive in the traffic or rely on the unreliable buses.  I take the 24 downtown and the 31/32 to UW quite a lot and it seems like for every time that its smooth sailing I'll be stuck in traffic most of the time.

And that sentence right there is why a lot of locals to the PNW hate transplants.  It's not that all transplants do that, nor even a significant minority.

A lot of people in your position have come here with expectations that the area cannot meet.  They believe the hype.  And when they show up and find out that it's not like an episode of Portlandia, they begin to complain.  Now like I said, that's not the majority of transplants.  But it's just enough of them that it's gone from the occasional event to a near-constant and frustrating occurrence.  I mod /r/portland, and we remove 3-5 posts every day of someone asking for advice on how to move to Portland with no pre-set plant at all.  We had to start removing those posts because no one was giving answers anymore, just telling people to fuck off.    Now, I don't know you or your story, so I'm not in any position to pass any sort of judgement.  I simply picked up on your statement about moving here with no pre-established job, recognized it for the common complaint I see in my sub, and expanded on that."

I imagine many scenarios are like that because that's a pretty reasonable circumstance to occur in life. I also understand the desire some people will have to pack up and go somewhere new without any solid plan, because that's also a reasonable trajectory for people's lives to take. What I don't get, however, is this pointless hostility towards people who do that. You might as well get angry at people for asking for dinner suggestions; you're not actually inconvenienced at all. And seriously, if you're getting frustrated about people asking for advice regarding moving to a city, then sticky that stuff or make a moving-specific sub or series of threads, and just message the people when that pops up on your sub."
SubredditDrama,3drel6,khanfusion,11,Sat Jul 18 22:01:43 2015 UTC,"I imagine many scenarios are like that   It can be for sure, but many scenarios not like that. For example, someone posted on r/Seattle saying that they were a young musician from Austin and he wanted to make it big in Seattle. His questions where something along the lines of ""where can I find a booker, does anyone have a free practice space I can play, can someone gee a show... etc."" I gave him some real advice such as ""you won't find a booker until your well known, you will not find a free place to practice, nobody will book you until your well known."" He through it back in my face since he didn't like the answer that he was going to have to do what we all have done. Play for free, live in poverty and don't stop trying. The crux of his point is that it's a Catch 22, which is really the problem you are running into. How to get a good job in Seattle? It's tough because you don't know anyone, how do I meet people withought a job? The answer is simple, but bitter to swallow. You won't find a good job initially unless you've been actively recruited, at least not for a few years. You will not find a cool place to live either. It takes time, and this city is based on networking. It's a small city and people who have been here long know pretty much everybody. They will always prefer someone they know over someone they dont.   The truth is, give it time. In a few years you won't have a problem."
SubredditDrama,3drel6,eyesonjune,7,Sat Jul 18 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"In the case you just provided regarding the musician, I'd say it's perfectly acceptable to fuck with a person like that. I mean, holy shit, what a weird sense of entitlement. On the other hand, maybe you don't fuck with him, because he might just be crazy.  As far as my life goes, I've managed to leverage at least one of my skill sets into employment. But it was pretty hard, because of the lack of contacts... and I knew it was going to be an issue well before we got here."
SubredditDrama,3drel6,khanfusion,4,Sat Jul 18 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, contacts are the primary for sure. Just keep at it and in a few years you'll be where all of us are."

It's not about the act of asking questions, it's what those questions represent.  Our economy isn't the best, having more people move here and tax our already limited resources frustrates long term residents.  Plus there's a notion that's held by many that the world ""transplant"" actually means ""Californian.""  Specifically, southern Californian.  And the PNW has hated California since long before I was born.  One of Oregon's former governors in fact famously said, ""I urge them to come and come many, many times to enjoy the beauty of Oregon. But I also ask them, for heaven’s sake, don’t move here to live.”  That was the governor speaking in 1971.  Now, I think I'm being 100% clear on what I'm trying to say.  I'm trying to explain WHY these mindsets exist.  Personally I don't really care who moves here or doesn't, the PNW is a gorgeous place to live and I can fully understand why people would want to be here.  I do care when people don't properly plan, because their welfare is at stake and I don't want to see their lives ruined through bad decision making.   And seriously, if you're getting frustrated about people asking for advice regarding moving to a city, then sticky that stuff or make a moving-specific sub or series of threads, and just message the people when that pops up on your sub.

It's certainly not confined to the subreddit, for example once some lady who moved from Colorado two years earlier made a """"""tongue-in-cheek"""""" infographic on why Austin sucks, and why you shouldn't move here which was frankly insulting to people like me who were born here and are active in trying to alleviate some of the issues (such as traffic) that come with +14% 5 year growth.

Boston and New York City are full of by far the rudest people, nobody on the West coast even comes close.  I laugh, though, when I see people say that the traffic in Seattle is out of control and they don't need any more people there clogging up the streets. Some of the traffic here (Phoenix) is an absolute nightmare, and our public transportation system is far worse. And that's nothing compared to basically all of California. I dread going to Oakland, San Jose, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. The traffic is absolutely insane, and the people who drive in it are even more insane.  On that note, what is something I absolutely must do when I'm in Seattle?

SubredditDrama,3drel6,Centidoterian,12,Sat Jul 18 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"A serious answer here: In the 1970s, we had a governor named Tom McCall who made national news by his controversial statement asking out-of-staters to visit our beautiful state but, for the love of God, don't move here! McCall was a popular and revered figure, a famously progressive Republican, and since that time, Oregonians (which often include Portlanders) have taken up the slogan.  Also, as a person who has lived in both Seattle and Portland, I give my opinion on the difference. Seattle is a striving place, breathtakingly beautiful and a small world-class city. Portland is a lot more mellow, willing to accept its fate, and sometimes feels like the biggest small town on the planet.  There is a rivalry and love between the two states that's amusing. Oregon constantly measures itself against Washington, and Washington envies Oregon's coastline and climate.  I like how Washington will never consider an income tax, while talking about a sales tax in Oregon will call out a lynch mob."

Everyone calling for single families to move out of Seattle, and those who have been here for generations, are generally not from Seattle. So it's kind of weird from a native perspective.

SubredditDrama,3dszya,csreid,2,Mon Jul 20 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"Someone needs to draw this guy a Punnett square of possible outcomes (I know that's not really how Punnett squares work but bear with me):  Top left quadrant: keep car, no attorney, convicted.  Bottom left quadrant: keep car, no attorney, acquitted.  Top right quadrant: sell car, hire attorney, convicted anyway.  Bottom right quadrant: sell car, hire attorney, acquitted.  Now if we were putting percentages on likelihood of outcome given attorney vs no attorney, pretty sure the odds of acquittal go WAY up with representation. In that case, no jail time, no loss of earning potential due to felony sheet. The difference this makes over the course of a lifetime (or even over the course of the year or more you're not in jail!) will replace any car owned by a 21-year old who can't afford an attorney. And if convicted, I dare say sentencing would still go more smoothly. For some reason I imagine judges just love throwing the book at defendants who go pro se in felony cases.  Now the keep-car options: if convicted, you won't be using your car for a year or more anyway, and you'll lose more than the cars value in wages while you're inside (oh and the car is depreciating the whole time). Odds of a conviction are higher. Odds of sentencing being a complete gong show are ridiculously high. But wait! If you secure an acquittal in a court of law, against a trained prosecuting attorney with the resources of the state behind them, you walk away with no record and you get to keep your car!   This sounds like a winning strategy. I mean, if OP were diagnosed with cancer and had to either sell his car to keep up his insurance premiums or let the insurance lapse and rely on his own medical knowledge accrued over twenty one years of solid decision making, we all know we'd tell him to keep the Saturn."

We're given minimal information about the situation itself but are still expected to completely buy into the narrative that David is the ""good"" parent and that the wife is the ""bad"" parent, despite the fact that David's family sides with her (though OP assures us that it's only because ""they don't know the real Beth"" but somehow he, the ""friend"", does).  Child support payments are mentioned as a terrible, negative fate to be avoided at all costs (""he's afraid she'll get full custody and he'll have to pay forever""). This ""loving dad"" would apparently move heaven and earth and break the law for the love of his son, but draws the line at having to actually pay money for the kid's upkeep.  Finally, our OP makes the bold move of dropping any pretense of objectivity and admits that he's seen ""horror stories on mensrights"". Once he says that it's pretty easy to re-read the post and see it for the melodramatic piece of fiction that it is. And in this case, it's really a relief.

Sadly, in plenty of places it's not illegal for a parent to take a child wherever the fuck they want, even against the express wishes of the other parent, if there's no custody/parenting agreement in place. So, if they're not divorced yet, he could be totally in the clear. From reading the thread, it seems like Canada has specific exceptions for taking kids in the manner, but quite a few (maybe all?) US states don't (as evidenced by this type of question popping up over there regularly, and the answer being ""(s)he's the mom/dad, no it's not illegal."""

My husband offered a pre-nup that addressed my concerns and basically would compensate me if I gave up years of professional advancement to take care of our family domestically only to be facing divorce and extreme financial hardship. I don't ever expect to get divorced and it meant a lot to me that my husband places concrete value on what I do domestically. To my surprise our lawyer told us this was the most common type of pre-nuptial agreements he did outside of severely skewed asset/income levels. Something that was also made very clear to me is that pre-nuptials are shaky in court. If I say, inherited a lot of money and then got a divorce, there'd be a very real possibility of the pre-nup basically being thrown out the window. Every time I read about pre-nups on reddit I get the sense that the people talking about them don't realize how they actually work."

So yeah, kidnapping, not a good idea. Kidnapping and taking kid(s) over borders, even worse idea."
SubredditDrama,3drg52,fuckinayyylmao,19,Sat Jul 18 19:21:09 2015 UTC,Yeah most kidnapping is related to custody battles rather than strangers in the bushes.  There are all these strange laws for getting travel documents for children to prevent that too.
SubredditDrama,3drg52,thesilvertongue,6,Sat Jul 18 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"There was a case in the UK recently, where a mother was originally awarded joint custody of her child with the father. She claimed the father was abusive, which there was no evidence, and when she discovered the father would get full custody, decided to flee with her child. Thankfully she turned herself in, but it's worth regarding that both genders can do this. It's also important that cases like this are handled in a ""firm but fair"" way, otherwise it runs the risk of creating repeat scenarios.

He probably does have reason to worry, because everything about this situation points to him being an inactive father whose primary goal is to control the mother, not care for the child. Of course the solution to that is exactly the opposite of what he wants to do, but if he were reasonable enough to realize that then this thread would never have existed in the first place."

SubredditDrama,3dqoa6,leadnpotatoes,12,Sun Jul 19 06:33:13 2015 UTC,"I guess so, the way they are arguing in that thread s I think it's sort of begging the question more than a little bit, but it's an interesting question and I've been thinking about this lately. It is good for areas/countries/etc to focus on their own crimes and treat them as unique and worthy to learn about, that seems fine, but sometimes I feel like it's a legitimate criticism that when there is a particular goal in mind it can create a narrative that is can skew the whole picture.   This is a kind of tangential example form popular stereotypes around history in the UK;  the Romans were taught in history in the imperial era because they were seen as a kind of kindred to the British Empire and the culture pre-dating that was seen as barbarian and uncivilised etc, towards the end of that and with the rise of celtic nationalism in the UK there was a counter to this where the Romans kept their association with the British Empire and were seen as brutal invaders (which is true) of a Celtic society that it's implied was morally superior (which isn't true).   Another example is this comment in the op thread   From what I learned in Black History class in the 90's, the African concept of slavery was radically different from the US concept. As in slaves were treated as human beings and could even eventually earn their freedom and marry into the family. I guess it wasn't as barbaric?    I used to think this (about the Caribbean aswell), but actually, depending on the slave trade it's more complex than that. Slavery in Africa, the Islamic empires and other places sort of related was obviously brutal and nasty, often involving death on the way and terrible treatment. 'Chattel slavery' that may or may not have been hereditary depending on where you lived and often involving doing similar things like agricultural work was practised in lots of other places that weren't the European colonies. Though it was more diverse and involved complex relationships some of the time there is evidence that chattel slavery was practised in parts of Africa for example (PDF warning)   Large numbers of chattel-slaves (as opposed to various kinds of semi-slavery) were used in cultivation and in animal husbandry. The kind of employment varied through time and place. In the northern coastal plains the sedentary communities used slaves both in small-holdings  and  on  larger  estates;  here  men,  preferably  strong  young  men,  were  required.More were probably required therefore since the Arab/nomadic disdain for agricultural work became widespread. From the  fifteenth century AD onwards, plantation agriculture can  be  recognized  north  and  south  of  the  Sahara,  while  in  the  north  more  slaves  were obtained to export to plantations in Southern Europe and the Levant. A special development in the Islamic period was the cultivation, particularly of date palms and cereals, in the oases of the Sahara made available by camel pastoralism and essential both for nomad diet  and  for  feeding  caravans,  especially  slave  caravans.  Controlled  by  nomad  tribes,whose  males  especially  despised  manual  work,  the  oases  were  dependent  upon  slave labour, requiring agile and strong young men. They were also used in animal husbandry,especially  small  stock  but  also  camels.  Another  development  was  in  plantation  agriculture in the north plains, especially sugar cane for export in the  fifteenth century.  While  free men might take part in mining/quarrying, especially in the eastern deserts for gold and  precious stones, the bulk  of  the work  was done  by  chattel-slaves in  both state enterprises and private ones. Here too active males were required. More were employed,in  the  Sahara,  in  salt  extraction,  especially  at  sites  like  Taghata  and  Bilma  where  slave colonies  provided  salt  for the  extensive  trade  through  the  sub-Saharan savannah populations,  especially  in  the  sixteenth  to  nineteenth  centuries AD (Levtzion  and  Hopkins1981)   there were a few places where 'surplus' slaves were used for sacrifice also. The numbers are lower (and over a longer period) but still estimated to be maybe  3.5 to 4 million so not insubstantial and this extract from  the Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery gives a good description of one such place, what they don't say is that the Sokoto Caliphate was a state of maybe 10 million people at it's height and perhaps one of the largest slave states in history.   Exceptions included those mainly Muslim savannah areas where slaves were needed for labour-intensive enterprises such as gold or salt mining, or were shipped as commodities in distant markets themselves, carrying other commodities on their heads. In time there were even some plantations growing crops for export, as in the Sokoto Caliphate of upper Nigeria, where laves toiled in the fields in gangs and lived in separate quarters. In almost exact parallel with  plantation America, their masters provided them with one or two days off per week to work their own provision grounds.    So I kind of think this gives a somewhat skewed picture but this shouldn't take away form the awfulness of European slavery chattel, plantation and otherwise and I obviously think it's a good thing that people learn about that."

SubredditDrama,3dqoa6,lookatmetype,11,Sat Jul 18 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"Sugar production also contributed to the decline of the environment and economy in Haiti.  This continued long after the slaves rebelled against the French in the 1790s and early 1800s.  In the 1980s, sugar production costs in Haiti were three times more than the world price.  You're correct that sugar production is incredibly messy and historically left to slave labor and migrants.  Nowadays, it's also left to impoverished farmers.  Add in deforestation (to make room for more sugar and fuelwood for sugar production), soil erosion, rugged terrain, tropical storms, droughts, the 2010 earthquake -- it's not sustainable.    Coffee is now the primary crop and sugar is second but there is still a high level of food insecurity in that country.

SubredditDrama,3dqoa6,skooterr,10,Sat Jul 18 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"From someobe with knowledge in this matter: the concept of slavery in many African cultures was very different then American slavery. Not justifying it, but this is why it isnt as well known or hated.  Slaves most commonly came from wars in which losers were enslaved. These slaves were generally used as houseworkera, and their treatment was more as workers rather then slaves. While the US was forced labor, African slavery was more akin to a job which provided housing food, and even healthcare.   Furthermore, there is a lot of ecidence that slaves were viewed as almost a part of the family. It was not uncommon to marry a slave, not by force but my choice, and people took great pride in their good treatment of their slaves, it aas seen as shameful if your slaves were not well fed and healthy, just as having underfed or unhealthy family members could be viewed as shameful.  Furthermore, there was a much greater level of upward mobility. Children of slaves were not bound into slavery, and considered full members of the community. There are many examples of children of slaves rising into positions of political and social power, and also cases of slaves themselves reaching some form of power. The easiest way to see slavery in West Africa is as a way to intigrate defeated tribal groups into society.  Now, that said Africa is a hug place and this is from my knowledgebase, which is primarily in West Africa, particularly Ghana. There are a lot of factors to consider, and outside slavery, both European and Islamic, was horrible. Nor am I defending slavery as a practice, it is undeniably awful to believe that owning other human beings is morally correct, but we have to acknowledge that there are certainly regional differences between slavery."

I'm pretty much on my own all day, and the work is pretty mindless, so I almost always have an earphone in. I always listen to something while I do chores, and sometimes, if I feel like being overstimulated, while I play video games. I adore the medium, and I'll listen to almost anything I can get my ears on. But for some unimaginable reason, a podcast about reddit and redditors has no appeal to me whatsoever. I get enough of reddit from this sub. There are so many amazing podcasts, and I learn fascinating things and hear incredible stories every day.

SubredditDrama,3drzo4,char_char_,6,Sun Jul 19 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the podcasts I listen to. I generally like the conversational type podcasts instead of the overly produced ones.  Infinite Monkey Cage: BBC radio show. Brian Cox and others discuss science-y stuff. (It unfortunately doesn't come on that often. Maybe 12 episodes a year.)  No Such Thing as a Fish: QI Elves make jokes about interesting trivia. Whenever a new episode comes out, I generally see the facts discussed heavily upvoted in TIL.  In Our Time: BBC radio show. The format is Melvyn Bragg discusses a topic with 3 professors on a particular topic. I have no idea how they come up with the topics, but the last few episodes were about Frida Kahlo, Frederick the Great, extremophiles, the novel Jane Eyre, and utilitarianism.  Hello Internet: You may not like this one because goodness knows they can't stay on a topic, but this is CGP Grey and Brady Haran (two YouTubers) discussing ... stuff. It's the self-described Two Guys Talking genre, and both of them are good enough talkers that it doesn't seem to be boring, even though one notable episode was about good and bad state flags — a topic not exactly suited for a podcast."

SubredditDrama,3drzo4,Mistuhbull,3,Sun Jul 19 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned good ol' NPR. Maybe it's because it's so obvious. The lot of em are so good I think it's worth mentioning even if they're obvious: this American life, planet money, snap judgement, story corps, wait wait (or their sister podcast, how to do everything), marketplace, on the media, science friday, and last but not least, fresh air. The NPR podcasts that I left out are in my opinion way too over-produced and are a bit obnoxious such as radiolab, invisibilia, or the ted radio hour. BTW, the ted talks are sometimes really really really really bad. There was a person who once said viet people can't think in conditionals (e.g. if I had failed this test, I would have failed this class, and my graduation would have been delayed) because the viet language doesn't have the exact word to describe that. One, it does. I know. I'm viet. Two, even if itdidn't, not having an exact word doesn't mean it can't be experienced. Think of all of those german words that describe specific things that we don't have in English, for example schadenfreude which describe the pleasure you get from seeing someone else's misfortune (e.g. someone getting pulled over by the cops). Clearly, we can experience and can describe such an experience. Anyways, rant over.. podcasting suggestions continue!  I don't really like any of the stuff-series podcasts (e.g. stuff you missed in history class, stuff to blow your mind, stuff your mom never told you) except, ""stuff you should know,"" because I like the personalities. But they're a powerhouse in podcasting, and that's for a reason. They're all pretty decent quality.  In terms of science and analysis podcasts, I have an army of suggestions.  Analysis:   99% invisible talks about design issues. A favorite of mine went over the design of the dollar bill. I thought it hilarious (though they certainly don't try to be) and a really interesting piece on something I have ALWAYS had and never thought about. True to the name, the design of the dollar bill was nearly invisible to me, but deeper analysis shows an item with meticulous, yet completely wacky, design.   EconTalk is an economics podcast hosted by a professor from Stanford who gives hour long interviews with, typically, other professors. Some of which are nobel prize laureates. At first, it's daunting to step into the world of economics with no formal training, but the host, Russ Roberts, always tries to explain jargon and his philosophy is that you'll learn a bit more every time even if you don't understand everything! And that was totally the case. I've slowly really come to appreciate a lot of economic theories and have been recommended incredibly fascinating books and topics by his guests. Recently, I loved the episode with Bent Flyvbjerg. He and Russ talked about big projects such as bridges. It sounds dry, but if you'll give it an hour, you'll come away with a much bigger appreciation for the whole process of planning, funding and building big projects.  BBC's More or less, Behind the stats, looks into commonly quoted numbers and determines their validity. It's eye opening to see which numbers die under the light (e.g. more planes are crashing, heavy running was shown to be hazardous to your health) and which are true (e.g. 1/9 death row inmates were subsequently freed). Half of their show is tutting the media on using shady and outright terrible statistics.   Science podcasts: (disclaimer: I'm a molecular biologist and so the list below veers into podcasts relating to issues that are near and dear to both my heart and profession. understandably, my interests may not be as interesting to you! )  This week in X (virology, parasitism, microbiology). professors from universities such as Colombia discuss issues of the day (E.g. ebola, MERS corona virus outbreaks), scientific papers, and case studies (only TWiP). Jargon heavy, but the hosts do aim towards biologists AND laypeople and so they DO try to explain jargon. If you have an interest in hearing a group of prominent and well respected researchers talking about things relating to their work as if you were a layperson and in the room with them (where you are considered, but not completely catered to), then this is great.  Boutique scientific journal pocasts: These podcasts are hosted by top tier scientific journals and typically feature the myriad of scientific papers in their journals. While it is geared towards scientists, it's geared towards a general scientific audience meaning it assumes basic concepts, but does not assume technical field expertise. For instance, they will usually assume things like basic statistics, but typically never assume intimate knowledge of any of the subjects of discussion because their journal's topics are so disparate (from ecology to microbiology to physics). Names: Science magazine podcast, Nature podcast, PNAS science sessions.  More molecular biologist podcasts geared with a lot of jargon: Science signaling podcast and neuropod.  I'm a laboratory worker and a lot of that includes semi-brainless routine work (such as literally smashing brains in a pestle and mortar, or dispensing small amounts of volume). With the above list, I'm never short of anything to listen to. I update my podcasting app every week and my playlist has never been below 40 hours. I'm constantly pruning because I'll never have time to listen to it all!  edit: I did not expect to write you an essay, but once I started with one recommendation, I couldn't not recommend the rest...!"

If you're saying ""ridley family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of zebezae, which includes things from space pirates to those fucking things that fly out of the ceiling when you walk under them.

A few months (?) ago, he got into a rather large argument about jackdaws crows in a default, and over the course of it the admins discovered that he used a number (5?) of alt accounts to upvote himself, and that he had done so in the past as well.

SubredditDrama,3drzo4,oikoik1,12,Sat Jul 18 22:38:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recap. I'll save the full drama for some other time when I'm bored.
SubredditDrama,3drzo4,Wallace_Grover,28,Sat Jul 18 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"The more relevant part, IMO, is that he would downvote others who provided the correct information if they answered before him. Not just upvote himself. He also poisoned conversation, you could have someone write a beautiful answer and people would just respond by pinging Unidan with his username and saying ""Can you confirm?"" I suppose he couldn't help that, but his loss wasn't really a negative considering the details behind the scenes. I personally think there should've been a movement to email Binghamton University and make them aware of the type of person representing them."

SubredditDrama,3drzo4,lovememychem,11,Sun Jul 19 12:56:37 2015 UTC,Well that's a dick move. It's one thing to stroke your own ego by upvoting your own stuff but manipulating other peoples answers just to boost your own sense of self worth is seriously shitty.

SubredditDrama,3dth73,shakypears,5,Sun Jul 19 11:16:21 2015 UTC,"the game is pretty alright up until about disc 3. everything with Esthar, post-war Laguna, Lunatic Pandora, and Ultimecia's time compression felt very rushed and thrown together. I mean, even Laguna pretty much shrugs when you inquire more about Ultimecia, which just makes her a badly handled foe overall. Adel had more backstory than her!  it just seems like, if they hadn't abandoned the political intrigue they had going on, there might've been something awesome there.   instead, you have Squall and Rinoa suddenly being in love when all their interactions beforehand show us there's absolutely nothing those two would like about each other, Seifer ends up getting to be a good guy even though he pretty willingly did some terrible shit, and the White SeeDs are so forgettable they could've been removed without changing the story more than a couple lines.   plus, the whole ""omg we all grew up in the same orphanage"" thing was just...ugh. that whole substory felt like a terrible version of the P2: Innocent Sin backstory/main plot element regarding the Masked Circle. it served absolutely no purpose, wasn't utilized to do anything worthwhile, and pops up just as quickly as it disappears."
SubredditDrama,3dth73,lifestyled,5,Sun Jul 19 15:04:39 2015 UTC,you have Squall and Rinoa suddenly being in love when all their interactions beforehand show us there's absolutely nothing those two would like about each other   This. At least the Cloud/Aerith/Zack thing kind of makes sense.
SubredditDrama,3dth73,AndyLorentz,4,Sun Jul 19 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Cloud is rendered a nutbar by inhumane experimentation and ends up taking on the personality of his buddy, who is Aerith's long-lost beau. She's intensely weirded out by this and wants to follow him around to figure out just what the hell is going on.  It makes sense!"
SubredditDrama,3dth73,shakypears,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"Meh. People talk about FFVIII falling apart, but the end of FFVII was pretty damn incoherent too. The stuff about Zack, Cloud, and Sephiroth came totally out of left field."
SubredditDrama,3dth73,pluckydame,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:42 2015 UTC,I actually recently replayed it. There are a lot of clues early on that Cloud isn't who he seems.   I got FFVIII on Steam Sale awhile back. Guess I should play it again.
SubredditDrama,3dth73,AndyLorentz,2,Sun Jul 19 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I played it, but from what I recall, Zack wasn't introduced until really late in the game. I think that was part of the issue to me. And while there's obviously something weird about Cloud, surprise human experimentation is kind of a big thing to just spring on people.    I think there were just as many, if not more clues about, for instance, the orphanage thing in FFVIII. (For instance, how Quistis is protective of Squall in particular.)"
SubredditDrama,3dth73,pluckydame,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"Zack wasn't introduced until Cloud and Tifa fall into the Lifestream and they begin to piece together his shattered memories. There are previous clues, such as on the date with Aerith, she says things like, ""You remind me of him"", and ""I'm trying to figure out who the real Cloud is.""  Apparently the Crisis Core games feature Zack as the main character, and they flesh out the events leading up to FF7."
SubredditDrama,3dth73,AndyLorentz,5,Sun Jul 19 21:07:05 2015 UTC,When it turned out that all the main characters were somehow all part of the same orphanage but they didn't realize it until later I was floored at how stupid it all was. Like...you wouldn't have noticed earlier? Even a little bit?  One of many reasons FF8 is among my least favorite.
SubredditDrama,3dth73,lolpancakeslol,3,Sun Jul 19 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"the justification is ""well GF usage ruins a person's memory, and Irvine knew about them all growing up together because he didn't use GFs that much so his memory was intact but he doesn't tell anyone until the world is like already going to shit and that's the whole reason he choked when trying to assassinate Edea"" but, like...just seems like flimsy justification. if GF usage is so bad it makes them all forget about living together in the orphanage, how does schooling at the Gardens work? wouldn't the kids just be forgetting a lot of their earliest years of education? do they have to constantly reteach this stuff to those kids?   and then, once their time together in the orphanage is brought up, they all remember it clearly without issue. so GF usage makes them forget stuff but it's easily remembered and retained?   just sounds like a faulty story element."
SubredditDrama,3dth73,lifestyled,5,Sun Jul 19 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"I never thought about that, how DOES education work if they're always forgetting everything?  Oh and how about the squid man in the basement of Balamb Garden? WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT?"
SubredditDrama,3dth73,lolpancakeslol,2,Sun Jul 19 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"NORG. yeah, that's another thing that bugged me, how you fight him and get like maybe a minute of backstory about how he was the original funder of Balamb Garden and SeeD and all that with Edea, but that's it.   his intention was to turn you over to Edea for trying to assassinate her, which ok, I guess makes sense, since she's trying to destroy the Garden at the time. but yeah, you never hear anything about him until that moment, not from anyone in the Garden, and then after you beat him he more or less is forgotten by the story.   which parallels my feelings with the Shumi and the Shumi Village as a whole, how there are these great areas that should have such a fantastic side quest and involvement in the story, but they're just given tiny little bits then are never relevant.   especially true with the Centra, who are supposed to be some super awesome ancient civilization, but have literally nothing involving them in the story other than a short entry in the in-game encyclopedia and visiting the ruins doesn't tell you anything about them."
SubredditDrama,3dth73,lifestyled,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"I assume the students don't start using GFs seriously until pretty late in their education. GFs are pretty hardcore, so giving them to actual children seems like a terrible idea.    So, if they don't start using GFs until later on, it makes sense that they would only have lost a limited number of memories. AND it makes sense that the memories lost would be the ones they use the least like, say, who they were in an orphanage with over a decade ago.    As for how they were able to regain and then retain those memories. I dunno. Maybe Ellone? The extent of her powers isn't 100% clear. Maybe when she was sending them back in time she was also helping to restore their memories."

SubredditDrama,3dth73,AndyLorentz,3,Sun Jul 19 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy IX is amazing. It has probably my favorite story. Except for the Necron thing.   Yeah, there's some weird stuff in FFVIII. I liked the characters, the setting, and the music, so I'm admittedly pretty willing to overlook some of the WTF moments, I guess. By comparison, most people like FFVII, but to me, it had the same weaknesses with WTF moments with much less likable characters and a worse setting and music."

SubredditDrama,3dth73,AndyLorentz,3,Sun Jul 19 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"FFIX has some pretty great music. It's my favorite soundtrack after VIII.    I should try playing FF6, then.

SubredditDrama,3dth73,pluckydame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"To me, the main plot of the game, and the focus on Squall's character development, is him slowly learning that it is OK to let people get close to him, Rinoa being the main example. It is through her love, and the love her feels back, that he is able to grow from a lonely kid eager to keep everyone as far away from him to prevent himself from getting hurt, to a true leader of men, willing to risk his own life in order to save the people he cares about. Their love is shown time and again to be a force for good that brings out the better of not just him, but her too.  Having that love be the cause of one of them turning to evil and causing so much pain runs counter to that, and of the positive things it causes to happen.  Sorry if that's not a good explanation, it's late were I am."

SubredditDrama,3drfac,MimesAreShite,5,Sun Jul 19 02:14:33 2015 UTC,man every time brits talk about food it just makes me sad for you folks
SubredditDrama,3drfac,Sojourner_Truth,9,Sun Jul 19 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"I used to run events for developers in NYC. One of the things I prided myself on was always getting really good food at these events, because it was a minimal extra cost and people loved it, like it would color their entire perception of the event for the better. I'm talking shit like gourmet sandwiches, beautiful salads, handmade deserts, the works. It would cost maybe a dollar more per person per meal to do it that way than to just order a bunch of Chipotle burritos, sometimes it even ended up being cheaper once I knew the caterers well enough.   One time I ran one of these events in London. I didn't have any catering connections myself out there, but I did some searching and had my people on the ground do some, and we found some guys who were really well reviewed and said all the right things to us, so we hired them.  Come the day of the event, and I'm livid. The food? The worst sandwiches I've ever had. Each sandwich: dry, heavy bread (think stale pumpernickel), one really thick cut chewy piece of meat, thick cut raw onions, one slice of cheese, and way too much mustard on the bottom piece of bread. There was literally nothing but these nasty-ass sandwiches. I was mortified, but put on the happy face because our sponsors had paid big bucks for the event and my job was to make sure everything felt smooth to them.  So I go over to discuss the food with them and apologize, and I come across the group from the sponsor company devouring the sandwiches. ""Oh my god 1point618,"" they tell me, ""You were really right about how great this food is.""   What?  And I look around, and all the developers are eating happily. In fact, the rest of the day all anyone could talk about was how great the food was, so much better than any event they'd ever been too.

When you define numbers in the set theory, you start with an empty set, a set containing an empty set, a set containing an empty set and the previous set, a set containing three previous sets (including the empty set) and so on. This way the number of items in a set is the number you're defining, and the empty set corresponds to zero."
SubredditDrama,3drfac,channingman,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"That's... a weird way of defining the natural numbers, but okay.  EDIT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers  Apparently there are a ton of issues with this definition."
SubredditDrama,3drfac,tsehable,2,Sun Jul 19 00:07:38 2015 UTC,To be fair though these problems are not particular to this definition of the naturals. They appear in any formal system that can express Peano-arithmetic which is the standard list of properties we expect natural numbers to have. So all definitions of numbers have these problems.  This definition is standard since historically we have wanted to unify mathematics into a single theory with as few undefined concepts as possible. Set theory seemed to be the unifier for most of the last century.
SubredditDrama,3drfac,channingman,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:17:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not. But throughout all of my mathematical career, which is admittedly small, I have never seen 0 defined as a natural number nor have i seen the set theory definition as shown."
SubredditDrama,3drfac,vendric,2,Sun Jul 19 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"In pretty much every algebra text I've read, 0 is included in N.  This makes N with addition into a left-cancellative commutative semigroup, which can be naturally extended into a group (isomorphic to the integers under addition).

SubredditDrama,3drfac,innrautha,4,Sat Jul 18 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"The term ""Natural Number"" does not have an universally accepted definition. Some take it to mean ""counting numbers"", i.e. 1,2,3,...; others take it to mean non-negative integers (0,1,2,3,...). Any mathematical research paper that uses that term will have at the beginning a sentence stating whether or not the author is considering zero to be a natural number. Many have taken to just using ℤ+ or ℤ+∪{0} notation.  Phrases such as ""In this paper the Natural numbers are taken to include zero"" are not uncommon."

In my experience, ""whole number"" is just used as an informal equivalent of ""integer"", which I'm guessing means the same thing everywhere.

Despite years of requests from donators to restrict the requesters on the sub to established reddit accounts in order prevent scammers from using the sub to take advantage of people, Backpackwayne continues to allow brand new accounts and suspected scammers to post and is very ban heavy on people who question the motives and flimsy stories of the /r/assistance requesters.  As a result, the /r/assistance sub is consistently flooded with shady requests and brand new accounts getting donations and then abandoning or deleting their accounts.  A handful of reddit users have been reporting reddit users that use /r/assistance to spam reddit with multiple requests for money and goods to /r/spam.  This has resulted in ~100 /r/assistance requesters who use reddit solely to beg for money and goods being shadowbanned, including a few confirmed scammers.  Backpackwayne does not want this to continue to happen and believes that people who post requests on his /r/assistance sub should not have to abide by the general spam rules of reddit.

SubredditDrama,3dq5mx,woesky,10,Sat Jul 18 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I think the reason most of all that our favorite turkish nationalist (the downvoted dude is a notorious turkish nationalist on /r/europe and over there) is pissed off is that Turkey gets a blanket color but a lot of countries get multi colored. He probably has a lot of RES tags saying ""cray cray"", I know I have him tagged""Grey Wolf"", so he probably gets a fair amount of auto-downvotes from the tag. When the reality is Turkey probably deserves an orange or yellow near syria, a yellow near armenia and kurdistan, and a green for most tourist areas. But if you have to give it an overall rating I think yellow is reasonable."
SubredditDrama,3dq5mx,optimalg,3,Sat Jul 18 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"I looked it up, and the Foreign Ministry seems mostly concerned about postelectoral violence and demonstrations. I guess that, as a government concerned with the safety of your citizens, you'd rather want to have a yellow color where it should have been green than the other way around.

There may be a bombing, but its not likely to affect a tourist area, ISIS is scared of Turkey at the moment and Turkey does not want to miltiary intervene due to the population being against it (and its not that the majority support ISIS, the vast majority dont but they also dont like Assad), and the Kurds generally try to avoid tourist areas nowadays because of how precious international support is to their existence currently."

Plus, other denotations on the map are just silly. I've spent time in Costa Rica, and outside of ridiculously rural routes used for drug traffickers and some parts of San Jose (just like any other modern urban area) the country is incredibly safe. And you see that squiggle of red in Peru? That runs along the Andy'sAndes, and likely represents where Maoist Shining Path rebels used to be. I say used to because their presence is basically a thing of the past now. The urban parts of Peru are incredibly modern, and the countryside is filled with hospitable and warm people.

Possibly Serbian or Bulgarian too, but I would have expected a more ""oppress people for millions of years and enslave them"" comment. Poland very specifically denies the very real ethnic cleansing of germans from poland after ww2 so they dont have the possibility of allowing property to be reclaimed, and they rephrase it as ""the realities of war"" or ""we were forced by the soviets."" not exactly genocide denial, dont get me wrong, but they do the exact same sort of shit. So do Greece and Armenia mind you, they also deny the historic turkish or azeri populations that they ethnically cleansed of ever existing, not to say again, that it is on par with genocide, but they are not exactly shining shining beacons of moral fiber either. In fact the human rights watch has hundreds of pages on their treatment of turkic minorities, and the armenians and azerbaijanis both ethnically cleansed each other in the 90s. So yeah, bullshit. You cant even call an organization an ethnic turk whatever in Greece without getting it disbanded and getting yourself arrested. Real liberal there. Turkey has issues but its clear you have you biases.   Edit: TIL that believing that the ottoman empire committed genocide, while also acknowledging that its neighbors also committed ethnic cleansing and still deny it to this day without being called a shithole literally makes me a neo-nazi. Stay classy reddit. Stay classy."

Assyrian, Greek, and Armenian. But if its easier for you to call me a genocide denier, rather than somebody who acknowledges crimes committed by all sides, I guess whatever allows you to sleep at night. Nationalism is a hell of a drug. Dont completely avoid confronting what happened, and come to terms with the fact that while what Turkey did was worse, the greeks and armenians, and poles are committed shady shit as well (while again, not quite being on the same level as genocide)."

Whenever I mention the ethnic cleansing by Armenians of Azerbaijanis they usually accuse me of being a genocide denialist. I will then post something like that and they will stop responding or do something like this. Its sad really, the same type of nationalist that causes them to hate on my nuanced opinion is the same idea that allows for turks to deny the genocide."

TLDR: I basically asked if you do or do not deny crimes against humanity. They are perfectly reasonable questions SINCE YOU FUCKING ACCUSED ME OF GENOCIDE DENIAL. Like holy shit, that is LITERALLY probably the most insulting thing you can say to me. That is like calling me a neo-nazi, and not being facetious, not like the neo-nazis, but like literally fucking a neo-nazi. Stop claiming harassment for a single PM, I did not want to start a huge debate on the topic on a public forum, but not only did you just call be a fucking equivalent of a neo-nazi, you then said I was harassing you FOR DEFENDING MYSELF after you me that? I am super angry if you cant tell, but I have a very legitimate reason to be. BTW here is the PM I sent him.    Question:   How is acknowledging crimes against humanity committed by Armenians denial of the Armenian genocide? I would like that answered, because I guess I therefor cant acknowledge the terrible crimes committed against the Armenian people if that is the case. Does denial of the Bosnian genocide in Serbia make it a quote ""shithole"" as well? Was Germany a shithole until a month ago when it finally called the Herero and Hamaqua genocide a genocide after denying it for more than a century? Is the Armenian ethnic cleansing of the Azerbaijanis from their own country considered acceptable in light of the ongoing war with the Azerbaijanis? Where the various massacres against civilian populations also considered acceptable in light of the ongoing conflict? In that case how does that contrast from the Armenian genocide? In my opinion both are completely unacceptable but I would like your thoughts on the matter.    Thank you for your time."
SubredditDrama,3dq5mx,woesky,0,Sat Jul 18 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Ethnic cleansing of germans? Just like germans were forced by the millions to move westward, so were the poles out of their pre ww2 eastern territories whose homes were now occupied by ukrainians and white ruthenians. From the way you wrote that, it sounds like you think all the Eastern bloc countries accepted communism, and not that it was ""forced by the soviets.""  Plus there were Germans who settled in those houses during the war while their polish inhabitants were slaughtered/sent off to germany for slave labour."
SubredditDrama,3dq5mx,Riverrun_past_eve,0,Sat Jul 18 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"I never denied that the Poles were not ethnically cleansed either, in fact the intention was to imply that even the victims can do shady shit. The fact is though that during ww2 there was a sentiment that if the war was won, danzig would most definitely go to the Poles, as well as more than likely silesia. So there was a yearning for a plan LIKE the Oder–Neisse, just not as extreme, it was only as a result for the need to further resettle refugees. There was a sentiment among the opposition pre war for something like this, which was close to the exact plan implemented. So in a sense they were forced by the Soviets to accept the western boundaries for what they were, but there was a strong sentiment that they should get more land, so it was like ""oh darn, we totally did not want these territories to begin with."" the ""recovered"" terrories were solidly ethnically german, even pre war, although with a strong polish minority. I dont think the the poles wanted communism, but they were certainly not against getting territory to the west, although they most definitely did not want to give up territory in the east. Sorry if its kind of unclear, but you get what I'm saying right? Basically assuming the Soviets had not decided to take any polish territory or taken it over, they still would have wanted territory to the west as reverence in the outcome of a win during the war. Although that does kind of go into alternate history."

While this isn't a perfect analogy, consider if you went to a restaurant and, on the way to the washroom, noticed they had a back room where a bunch of skinheads were eating.

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,jimmahdean,39,Fri Jul 17 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the part I consider imperfect as well. One way to look at it is that the users are the customers, and of course we (normal users) ""pay"" through some combination of advertising and gilding, and the skinheads, for the purposes of the analogy, don't pay.  Really, though, the users are sort of the product, with the idea being that Reddit is selling their attention to advertisers. So in that case, in a restaurant, the product is the food. So the users are the food and the advertisers are the customers. In this case, I guess the customer wanders into the kitchen and finds they have a bunch of guys making ice cream cakes that look like Adolf Hitler, and they're just storing them in a walk in freezer marked ""Do not sell""."

Before this decision, people were criticizing the perverse incentives that reddit had from having ads on racist subs - in that reddit made just as much money from bringing new people to the site for racism as it did bringing new users for non-crazy purposes.  To play devil's advocate: this addresses that concern. They now profit far more for bringing new users who are mainly interested in non-objectionable content to reddit than they do from bringing in new users who are mainly interested in the objectionable content subs."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,MaryJaneThotsen,33,Fri Jul 17 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"Let's be a little more cynical. It's not the gildings, but the network: someone who goes to /r/hatespeech is likely to go to /r/aww or /r/guns or /r/foodporn from time to time just out of the virtue of already being on reddit and thus reenter the ""paying"" part of reddit than someone who stays on hatespeech.com's forums. Likewise, someone who's drawn from /r/mildhatespeech to /r/hatespeech probably still follows the original subreddits that brought them to the site."

If I were a mod for r/blackladies, personally I'd be more concerned that u/spez reiterated his support for killing the moderator's ability to actually delete comments, without acknowledging any of the concerns people had with the idea.  If he goes through with that, it will kill places like r/blackladies more thoroughly than if Reddit actively started advertising the racists subs on Stormfront.  Then again, I guess the idea must be that if they do something like that, they'll just close up the sub and go off-site?

But, well, the story's the same pretty much everywhere on the internet. People break the rules because they don't understand them, or don't care; when the moderators zap their comments, they get defensive because they feel like they've been called bad people and want to justify themselves. And since it's rarely the worst person in the world who's had their comment removed, someone else is likely to be similarly ill-informed or judgmental, and agree that a questionable thing wasn't over the line.  If you instituted this sort of policy nearly anywhere (private forums, forums that have months-long initiation processes, and forums that require payment excluded), you'd see a similar problem arise. Even places that generally trust their moderators will have their faith eroded by semi-regular flare-ups over this sort of thing. The only hypothetical antidote would be to swiftly ban anyone who questioned their judgment, which doesn't really sound like a healthy recipe for a community to me.  Trying this in a place where users already distrust the mods and are convinced there's some kind of massive conspiracy against them... Well, it's not hard to imagine how it would go."

I get ticked off when someone talks about rape is no big deal; people ask why I'm getting so angry or high-handedly proclaim there's no use talking to someone so irrational. I decide there's no point in talking to someone so stupid as to think that rape is no big deal; comment goes unchallenged, or possibly results in a group of people convincing themselves that women are just overreacting. I calmly and reasonably have to justify why my bodily autonomy is important to someone who thinks rape is no big deal. It is a irritating, stressful affair that puts me in a sour mood for the rest of the day, and at the end of the day he probably still doesn't see me as wholly human. I make snarky, passive-aggressive comments at the guy talking about how rape is no big deal. I ""win"", but the already dismal quality of discussion in whatever community this happens in continues to degrade.   Of course, most halfway-decent sites will ban things on that level...

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,igward,74,Fri Jul 17 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:  •The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.  •A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was somehow so we can better learn the rules.  •A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.  •A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.  edit: A spam area makes more sense than hiding it entirely.   Emphasis added.  Every tool the moderators had to delete posts would now just hide them. And the only concern he addressed was people concerned that moderators would start using the spam tool as a work-around to actually delete stuff, so he edited it to an ""exile to spam pile"" option.  In every one of his bullet points, he wants every moderator-deleted comment to be visible, and the only reassurances he made was a bit of vague wording in the original post suggesting that he might make it difficult to use. Which, in my opinion, will probably result in someone coming up with a tool to make it not difficult to use, now that it would actually be possible.  He does make some vague motions about better tools to combat trolls, but does anyone really think that will happen?  EDIT: Fixed broken formatting."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,78456753456246,100,Fri Jul 17 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"That's what cracked me up the most, that he thinks people are going to look at the deleted comments to ""learn the rules.""

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Dacryphile,83,Fri Jul 17 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"What I found most baffling was how narrow the reasons he considered were: ""Off-topic"", ""Trolling"", and ""Spam"".  If I'm a moderator looking to calm a brewing flamewar by nuking a comment thread, what does that fall under? Things may have been getting abusive, but that's not really ""trolling"", and I question whether a toolset designed around that presumption would be appropriate. And hiding the entire thing as off-topic isn't likely to solve the problem - it's probably going to spill over to the other threads, particularly if certain lines have been crossed.  What about actually wanting to censor dissent? Not in the stupid conspiracy-laden nonsense way, but the very normal ""No holocaust denial, no claiming all African-American teens are criminals, no claiming women have half the intelligence and drive of men"" sort of way. If I run a subreddit, and believe cutting off oxygen to these views are the best way of solving the problem, why can't I declare these topics forbidden from my domain? Why am I being forced to either waste hours of my time rebutting these views, or leave them up unchallenged? To say nothing of the effect of people in my community who actually are being called subhuman. I guess this could fall under the heading of ""trolling"", but there's an awful lot of otherwise-normal users who get downright racist if the opportunity arises - calling it ""trolling"" really understates the problem in my opinion.  What about breaking the ToS by posting personal information or CP? This is pretty serious stuff that also isn't necessarily trolling - if I say ""To heck with it, Milo's gone too far this time. Here's his address and personal phone number - go crazy."", I'm not necessarily a troll, just someone with downright horrible judgment whose created a problem that needs to be immediately dealt with. And if I'm just a somewhat unstable person having a bad day, the mods might not necessarily want me banned (the obvious result of turning me in to the admins) - just for the problem to go away.  I kind of feel like I'm being told that subreddits are no longer allowed to have rules anymore, because that wasn't one of the listed grounds for deletion - that setting ""rules"" is only declaring what is and isn't on-topic.  Maybe it's just an issue of framing, but I don't really get the idea that /u/spez really understands what moderators do around here. I'm sure I don't really understand either, but I can see at least a few problems that having such a limited vision could cause."

Like...not only have they not done anything about the problem, they have decided that they are going to give the subreddits their official seals of approval. They've just empowered them.

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Minxie,51,Sat Jul 18 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not that they want to side with racists. Their M.O from day one has been ""do as little as possible"".

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,ImNotJesus,300,Sat Jul 18 02:27:45 2015 UTC,"This is nothing new, the admins have a history of siding with racists over /r/blackladies. Hell they even banned one of /r/blackladies mods for interfering with the culture of certain (racist) subreddits."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Nurglings,166,Sat Jul 18 06:51:29 2015 UTC,Why do you think the admins prefer racists to /r/blackladies?   Are they just cowards?
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Minxie,310,Fri Jul 17 19:48:42 2015 UTC,I think they started out with a really stupid ideology where everyone is going to sit down together and rationally debate ideas until the truth is determined and everyone walks away wiser.  Environments like that are perfect for shitty ideas that don't get traction in normal places.  Now years down the line they're stuck upholding a failed idea because they're scared to look like hypocrites or piss off the base too much.
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,dontmovetoportland,119,Fri Jul 17 22:30:54 2015 UTC,John Stuart Mills was wholly unprepared for the internet.
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Cthonic,129,Fri Jul 17 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"Well the thing about the marketplace of ideas is that it only works if ideas that are determined by the community to be bad go away. In this case, far from going away, they are being artificially empowered by the admins. That's the funny thing, really, is that for all this talk of free speech, people seem to have forgotten that the right to free speech is a practical one, and not a good in itself."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,MackDaddyVelli,86,Fri Jul 17 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"More than that, the ""marketplace of ideas"" fails when people's beliefs are not just held because of rational arguments, but because of conscious and subconscious biases and irrational prejudice.  When anti-vaxxers, Holocaust deniers, and other bigots cannot be swayed from their views, then it is lunacy to allow them to continue to use the public space for spout their bullshit."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,GobtheCyberPunk,42,Fri Jul 17 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"More than that, the ""marketplace of ideas"" fails when people's beliefs are not just held because of rational arguments, but because of conscious and subconscious biases and irrational prejudice.   Under this argument, the ""marketplace of ideas"" always fails. There's no human who truly holds all of their beliefs purely based upon reason.  That said, I agree completely that dangerous and harmful views do not need to be subsidized or allowed on private property, and Reddit just harms themselves and their community by continuing with such a dumb idea."
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,Aethelric,8,Fri Jul 17 20:26:59 2015 UTC,Also the marketplace of ideas is only half the picture. No forum works without rules. Even in Mills' case the marketplace only exists in the first place because the state provides the necessary safe space for it to exist and flourish.
SubredditDrama,3dniy9,wrc-wolf,16,Fri Jul 17 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't know.  A lot of people just use pithy quotes from Mill, and haven't actually read On Liberty.  For example:  ""Before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take some notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinions should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do not pass the bounds of fair discussion....In general, opinions contrary to those commonly received can only obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the most cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever deviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really does deter people from professing contrary opinions."""

SubredditDrama,3dniy9,valarmorghulis13,188,Fri Jul 17 20:49:24 2015 UTC,"The more I look at my country the more I realize most Americans are deeply racist in the sense that they'll immediately brush off any criticism of racism as being misguided or paranoid. We're filled with this idea that when black people are saying they are being discriminated against that it means they must be lying or have some sort of ulterior motive. Hell, Dylan Roof murdered 9 people explicitly because of their skin color and a good chunk of the conservative (read: white) media went out of it's way to act like it wasn't racially motivated domestic terrorism. Because they just flat out don't want to admit that this part of our culture exists and that our ignoring it has serious real world consequences.   I think this is what the reddit admins aren't getting here. You can talk about MLK all you want, but if this was the 60's a massive chunk of the reddit user base would be calling him a race baiting lunatic.   Reddit letting these openly racist subs exist is perpetuating that culture. It is giving that ignorance a place to grow. And I'm starting to think a lot of the reddit admins are more privy to it then they want to admit."

They fall back on dramatic dialogue they pick up from comic books, movies, and video games because they can't express arguments or beliefs in a conversational way.

It's one of those things that, once you lose that perception of importance, you can't really reclaim it.

On one hand I know people in this site pretend to be black to hide racist opinions. On the other hand black people are not a hive mind so sometimes they are going to have different ideas.

Instead it should be ""my son and me"" or ""me and my son"", both of which are object pronouns.

Other countries, like the UK, require psych approval to even get hormones, so it varies depending on where you are."
SubredditDrama,3dpgk0,Ughable,6,Sat Jul 18 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"TBH, that's slightly a falsehood for informed consent.  It's fairly rare to find places that have it, so those who live near it are in the minority. Here's an example of a PDF someone put together listing all the ones that were confirmed, of which there's literally none in my state of Florida. So most people will be forced to go through psych approval, unless they're lucky as hell to live near a place that has IC.  Same for surgery, a few doctors totally might do any surgery without a therapist's letter, but that's fairly uncommon from what I understand.   I think countries with health care like the NHS are more stringent about psych approval across the board, but then they actually do cover stuff. Versus in the US where most isn't even covered by their private insurances, due to trans exclusions, resulting in them being OOP expenses."

Even a breast augmentation requires more than just walking into the clinic and getting it done one day. Transitioning, in my country, requires a lengthy period of counselling, then being prescribed hormones, then taking those hormones for the rest of your life, waiting for your body to change fully for the first couple of years, and then after several years, if they choose it, undergoing a extensive and painful series of surgical procedures. Unfortunately, it's not just going into the hospital one day, shouting ""GIRL ME"" and walking out a lady.   People who think that trans people do all of this for gender don't have half a clue about how much it takes to go through the entire transition period."

Did I, anywhere in my post, insult you, or do anything than point out the clear hypocrisy in your claim to ""have nothing against transpeople""?  And you come here, trying to play the victim but in your comment you still refuse to call her Caitlyn even when people have explained to you in no uncertain terms exactly why this is hurtful and insulting. Don't pretend that nothing you said was derogatory when you talk about how Jenner ""castrated himself and left behind a fistula"".   If you'd turned up and even seemed slightly apologetic for how much of a dick you were being, I'd be way more sympathetic, but seriously, no apology, no regret, just ""my feelings can be hurt too"" and ""hey man I have a right to my opinions"".

SubredditDrama,3dpgk0,FixinThePlanet,83,Sat Jul 18 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"It's gotten worse because it's getting better.   A couple years ago, the conversation about the trans community just didn't happen. Most of the world only knew about transgender people as a punchline, and while the total lack of conversation could be perceived as a lack of hate from the outside, the truth is that trying to talk about it privately with people who you actually know was a harrowing experience.   My ex-girlfriend, who frequented tumblr and vocally supported transgender people there, said I was being silly and worrying to much when I told her I was starting to think I was trans. She actually managed to convince me that I wasn't, which just left me feeling awful for way longer than I needed to. But she had never actually met someone who was trans, so despite claiming she was supportive so that she could appear on the right side of history, the truth was she didn't have any idea of how to deal with it.  Now with people like Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner taking center stage, people are starting to become more aware. My family and friends are incredibly supportive, and despite not having actually begun HRT and such yet, I've never felt better about myself since coming out.  But now the people who won't accept change and don't like things being different are also starting to join the conversation where they otherwise never had a conversation to join. And that sucks, but it's a side effect of the conversation happening at all."

In addition to the risk of birth defects, people with exposure to high concentrations of Bisphenol A appear to have more Type 2 Diabetes & CVD.  The other problem is that BPA is finding its way into new paper supply by people recycling thermal paper.  When it ends up getting pulped and recycled, the non-thermal paper product that gets made from it will have some BPA too.    They've put a tinfoil lizard-people spin on it, but underneath that, BPA does seem to be a legitimate public health risk that the FDA is trying to understand better, and explore options to replace."

As someone who is a top chef who studies burgers, I am telling you, specifically, in the culinary arts, no one calls chicken sandwiches burgers. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""burger family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of sandwiches, which includes things from grilled cheese to patty melts to reubens .  So your reasoning for calling a chicken sandwich a burger is because random people ""call the sandwiches burgers?"" Let's get BLTs and meatball subs in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a chef or a cook? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A chicken sandwich is a chicken sandwich and a member of the burger family. But that's not what you said. You said a chicken sandwich is a burger, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the burger family burgers, which means you'd call blue flatbreads, paninis, and other sandwiches burgers, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

It's an art form, different regions of the country have different styles, etc. This kind of barbeque is Serious Business, but is not usually something you'd do at a party because it takes a long time (although sometimes people will start smoking a whole pig in the morning, then invite people over when it's close to done).  Sometimes, a ""barbeque"" refers to cooking food outdoors, using intense heat from a gas or charcoal grill.

SubredditDrama,3dokds,Bossmonkey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"That's not the kind of ""bbq"" people are talking about in that thread.  What you just described is called a cookout in large parts of the US, particularly the South.  BBQ is a type of food, usually slow roasted pork or beef, or less traditionally chicken, usually with a spicy seasoning and some kind of vinegar or tomato based sauce.  A barbecue pit is what bbq is cooked in traditionally, especially in the Carolinas.  In the old days, it was literally a hole in the ground filled with hot coals that the meat was suspended over to cook for hours.  Some places still cook BBQ like this, but usually a BBQ pit is a brick or cinderblock structure that serves the same function.  BBQ can vary considerably in different parts of the South, sometimes even within the same state, so rivalries about these different styles exist between different parts of the country.  And as far as being boring, keep in mind the main point of slow cooking, besides making really tender meat, is to sit around with your friends and get drunk."

SubredditDrama,3dokds,papaHans,2,Sat Jul 18 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"i know that  It's beef brisket. It is the ends of the brisket that they cut off, they're burnt and much more tasty than the rest of the brisket. They're sort of a happy accident they used to get discarded because they aren't as juicy and fatty as the rest of the brisket until people realized how delicious they were.   http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/08/what-are-burnt-ends-brisket-barbecue.html  And yeah I'm not usually getting fries with BBQ, most places have a full line of other sides, like baked beans, veggies, corn on the cob, in Georgia we have something called Brunswick Stew https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_stew."

SubredditDrama,3dokds,papaHans,2,Sat Jul 18 16:54:13 2015 UTC,Oh that sucks. I would make myself sick on shellfish while visiting New England.   You can probably find Brunswick Stew as far north as upstate SC but it'll be better in Georgia.   When you get into the SC low country they make something called hash. http://gardenandgun.com/article/hashmasters Which is similar to Brunswick stew but very different at the same time it is served over rice.  Low country SC also has the runny vinegar based sauce that I think is my favorite for pulled pork.

I feel /r/conspiracy could do better with people that actually tried though.  Have a well written copy paste for the far outside weird stuff.  If someone wants to bring up the flat Earth theory again, they need to find a fault in the logic that the sub came up with.  Just paste that to them and leave it, instead of constantly entertaining them.  Not just link some youtube videos of a fucking hand and say, oooh think about it."
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,crackeraddict,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. A copypasta would be the opposite of trying. The fact is that I don't really see a substantive difference between a flat earther conspiracy theorist and many of the others. If anything, they should be accommodating toward them."
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,NeedsMoreReeds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"There are some theories and ideas that just simply aren't worth our effort nor time to actively discuss and disprove every single time someone brings them up.   To be fair that's the point of their sub.  Anything and everything can be possible.  It's hard to draw a line without possibly missing something or becoming a sub that they don't want, censorship and all that.   Yeah, I think the original objection is a bit off-point.  The key idea should be that while everything should be open to discussion, that discussion happening should be an actually meaningful event: you evaluate presented arguments, come to a conclusion that they have no merit whatsoever, and don't discuss the subject ever again unless there's some new arguments.  Flat-earthers on the other hand seem to have this really weird attitude where they are ""keeping an open mind"" not toward possibilities, but even towards the arguments themselves that were thoroughly disproven. That actually devalues the idea of having discussions about anything because it makes them inconsequential."

My point was that if he was bragging about his intelligence and he had actually gone to college, he would definitely have mentioned his 4.0 gpa and his summa cum laude before he mentioned honors classes."
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,TheIdesOfLurch,4,Fri Jul 17 19:58:11 2015 UTC,Some colleges actually do have honors programs. I've never read about one that I would ever consider though because they pad their curricula with bullshit that probably have nothing to do with your major just so you can say you did something different and special.
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,MohnJaddenLunar,9,Fri Jul 17 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I noticed about my undergrad's honors program.

SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,TheIdesOfLurch,4,Fri Jul 17 21:27:42 2015 UTC,"My departments honors program simply requires that one take an extra, difficult, in major class and write a undergraduate thesis on some research topic within the field."
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,RyeDo,27,Fri Jul 17 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"The university where I work has an honors program that's quite good.  You work with a faculty member to produce an honors thesis, there are dedicated honors courses in every major that are more in-depth and cap the class size at a lower number (I think it's 12, it's been a while since I've taught one). You can even arrange an honors contract in classes that are not honors. They also get to register before anyone else and their printing is free."

I don't judge people who enter those programs as idiots, nor do I think the work they do isn't difficult or not valuable. But I had a pretty strong focus that I wanted to pursue and entering an honors program that forced me to do a lot of work aside from my major just wasn't for me AT ALL. It doesn't help that the program at my particular university isn't what I would consider excellent. It came across as just a more work intensive, constricted, and accelerated version of the common core the rest of us undergrad students had to take."
SubredditDrama,3dnfzb,Hammedatha,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"I guess it all comes down to the strength of the program. The general idea is that you take some outside honors classes for the edification of it (your experience may vary) and the line on your resume.

SubredditDrama,3dpamf,Kujara,7,Sat Jul 18 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"Basically, there is this idea in conspiracy theories that when the building was hit by the plane (As told in the ""official story""), it wouldn't have collapsed as it did.   The common argument that they use is that when the plane hit the building and caused the top floors to lose their support and fall down, they should not have continued to fall past that. The idea they argue is that since the building already held the weight, it should not be further collapsed by that weight falling. Hence, the assumption that there had to be some internal reason (Explosives, designed to fail, etc.) that the building collapsed.   What he is trying to show with the video, horribly, is that the cardboard box hitting the tower of boxes did not cause it to further collapse. Hence, there had to be another factor because the “free” box fell at free fall speeds (Which really doesn’t mean anything.)   What they are missing is that there is a difference between what is called a static load and a dynamic load. A static load is one that stays constant, i.e. the weight of the floors above it. A dynamic would be the floors collapsing onto it. The floors collapsing would cause a load more than that of the static load because there is momentum to it. Easiest way to see this for yourself, place a basketball on your chest. You can definitely feel it there. Now throw it straight up or have someone drop it on you, you will definitely notice a difference.   Now, the reason the video doesn’t show this is that in engineering there is a phrase “Anyone can build a bridge that stands up, it takes an engineer to design a bridge that will barely stand up”. It is possible to design a building so it would resist the dynamic load better, the cost would be outrageous. So the building is designed to withhold the static load with a safety factor high enough that outside of extreme circumstances (A plane crashing into it) it will stay up. That is why the cardboard box analogy is wrong, same with the guys example of him doing his small scale testing, is that they are not designing it correctly. (Note: There are other reasons the cardboard box is a shit comparison, but I am not going to go into it.)  Source: Knows physics, knows many civil engineers"

A large side impact such as that would disrupt the balanced structure.  And then once floors start falling it's more like a house of thick cards."

Anyway, this little sidebar is no longer worth my time. Best of luck to you and your clearly troubled life.  Commenter - Maybe it's your inability to take a joke mixed with your superiority complex then?  OP - That must be it! Thanks for the insight, doc. Take care now.  Commenter - Maybe it's your inability to give up the last word then?  OP - More like a combination of me being principled and loathing you at the moment. By the time I wake up, I'll have forgotten you exist.  Commenter - Maybe it's your bad memory then?  OP - Yikes, wrong again there mensa. I'm sure that, much to my and everyone else's chagrin, we'll have to sit back as you reconfigure your pitiful excuse for armchair psychology.  Commenter - Maybe it's because you don't realize when you're being trolled on the internet then?  OP - Mhmm, cause of the two of us, I've clearly been the one to demonstrate the depths of human idiocy.  Commenter - Maybe it's 'cause you forget the apostrophe when shortening because to 'cause?  OP - Nah. I skipped it cause this is the internet and I can. Any other theories? Cause clearly I trust the opinion of someone who knows zero things about me but decides to get personal pleasure out of attempting to hurt me.  Commenter - Maybe it's 'cause you think people are out to get you?   Edit: OP would go on to say this when she woke up (in case this gets deleted too):   Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. Furthermore, I'm just going through a really hard time and wanted someone to feel connected to. I put ""shouldn't have to"" in quotations not to express a superiority, but to express my difficulty in connecting easily in real life the way other people seem to. Anyway, I certainly didn't think I'd have so many people calling me a cunt or basically cutting me down in any way they could over such little information. So...I'll try not to let that get to me but honestly, I don't know what'll happen now. I'm pretty low."

A key to waking up almost every morning to an inbox stuffed to the brim with consensual pictures of women's breasts and genitalia taken only for you and no one else.  And it's not just online! I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've been on the train when a woman (usually around an 8/10. Notice I said 8/10 and not 10/10. That's to give credence to my story because if I said 10/10 you wouldn't believe me. It also makes me look like I have really high standards when in fact I do not) when a woman stops me and kind of cocks her head to the side and looks at me deep in thought.  Haha and I always just smile and say ""It's alright, miss. You can ask me. I get this all the time."" Then she always blurts put ""Wow. Are you THE /u/bonjouramigos? The guy whose gildings have paid for almost 2 entire weeks of Reddit server time? You're really hot, too. And muscular. And by the way you're dressed I can tell you're rich because that's a pretty expensive OFFICIAL World of Warcraft t-shirt you're wearing. Wow. Panties. Dropped.""  And then, naturally, we bang.

I was pretty certain, so I looked into it; this is a post with 0 points and is getting slightly more attention than the occasional post on there that gets about 300 points. And when I say occasional, there are about two posts within the top of all time there that are less than a year old, and they've all got around 400 points or so.  It's pretty blatant, really.  Edit: fucking wow, those comments. If you're not from /r/all, and you even upvoted, let alone contributed to any of that bullshit you should be fucking ashamed of your self. Bunch of fucking morons. Have fun getting the sub banned because you couldn't help but beg for attention and Internet points."
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,acroniosa,96,Fri Jul 17 13:51:23 2015 UTC,And this is why I always laugh when people say SRD doesn't brigade
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,apiratewithadd,50,Fri Jul 17 15:09:02 2015 UTC,It honestly didn't happen all that much before. I've noticed it happening more and more after ask the recent meta drama. I think all the extra people we picked up aren't the sit and watch type.

SubredditDrama,3dlugt,the_omega99,5,Fri Jul 17 21:23:20 2015 UTC,I understand that 1000% as well but it is hard to deny a subset of SRD does exactly what we say we shouldn't. I'm NOT accusing SRS btw. I'm just saying in general.

SubredditDrama,3dlugt,apiratewithadd,17,Fri Jul 17 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"I think the important distinction when people talk about subreddit's brigading is whether the brigading is condoned or encouraged. /r/SubredditDrama doesn't condone it at all. I'm not sure why the fuck there's so many members in this sub that can't understand why what they're doing is wrong.  As an aside, I really love when someone posts slightly old drama in this sub. It becomes immediately obvious when popcorn pissers comment."
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,FedoraBorealis,13,Fri Jul 17 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"If a subreddit doesn't condone it, but they do link to comments, and those comments are routinely brigaded ... I mean, /r/SubredditDrama is brigading, you can't make the claim that it's not. If the end result of the subreddit's culture is that brigading happens (and quite a bit of it), does it really matter that much whether it's condoned by the mods? The results seem like what matters to me, not the philosophical stance of the people running the subreddit. If I'm in a small sub and get shat on because I was featured in a frontpage post on a large sub, I don't think it matters too much to me that people have been told not to do it."
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,TheLazySocialist,9,Fri Jul 17 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I think if the admins would actually make NP mean ""no participation"" and not ""pretty please don't participate"" there'd be a big difference.  In addition to actually disabling the voting (I doubt that many people change to a non-NP URL just to vote), they could do things like scramble the URL to make it harder to get to the non-NP site from the NP site."
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,theAmazingShitlord,3,Fri Jul 17 19:59:21 2015 UTC,Mmmm piss flavoring
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,danielkuzmin,9,Fri Jul 17 20:04:23 2015 UTC,There was a time where the sub accepted that and didn't try to ring up excuses for itself. Must be all the new members from the Fattening.

SubredditDrama,3dlugt,delta_baryon,36,Fri Jul 17 18:29:20 2015 UTC,I'm a bit unsure what people are objecting to. She didn't like being told she had a shitty personality. How dare she?

SubredditDrama,3dlugt,NotJohnStamos,18,Fri Jul 17 16:34:35 2015 UTC,She might just be getting downvoted by regulars of the sub.

SubredditDrama,3dlugt,apiratewithadd,35,Fri Jul 17 14:25:10 2015 UTC,Brigading from here happens way too often. What's worse is people have to willingly take time to remove the NP from the link to do so.
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,ALaccountant,22,Fri Jul 17 14:27:27 2015 UTC,That really sucks. I didn't think we were bad about that. No wonder other pages call us out.
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,Amelaclya1,10,Fri Jul 17 15:38:51 2015 UTC,Keep in mind at lot of the brigading and popcorn pissing is done by people who never post here. They just use the front page of the sub as jumping links.
SubredditDrama,3dlugt,Tofinochris,8,Fri Jul 17 16:28:40 2015 UTC,If they are coming from here it is still our fault. Same thing with FPH which I agree had a large number of members cross the line the mods had set up.

For instance, why rail only against a round earth or climate change or the moon landing, etc, when you could question far more fundamental scientific principles?  Where are the people claiming, ""potential energy don't real,"" and accusing anyone who believes otherwise of being a shill for BIG STATIONARY ROCK ON THE HILLTOP?

SubredditDrama,3dogeo,Chairboy,5,Sat Jul 18 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"This is perfect, we could make a whole branch of flat earth conspiracy based around this.  The flat earth is accelerating upwards and the reason space rockets always turn sideways a minute after launch is because they're actually trying to blast towards the edge of the disc that everyone in NASA knows about and tries to hide from us.  That's why NASA launches out of Florida: it's convenient access to the so-called Bermuda triangle which is actually the outer edge of the earth. That's why ships disappear, they fall off.  It's not even a triangle, it's actually the outer circumference of the flat earth and it's only a conspiracy of cartographers that leads us to believe otherwise.  How'd I do?"

SubredditDrama,3dogeo,Sta-au,5,Sat Jul 18 02:40:19 2015 UTC,"What I always have wondered about these people is that how can they think the world is flat? The Greeks, the Maya, the Sumerians, the ancient Chinese all figured out the shape of the world. So where does this belief that the world is flat come from? It's like they're saying it's flat just to be contrary."
SubredditDrama,3dogeo,hobgob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:09 2015 UTC,"I was browsing the flat earth subreddit earlier today after the couple of flat earth people that got posted today. One of the posters was incredibly religious I guess and firmly believed it because of some sort of biblical interpretation and not questioning god or whatever. The rest seem like they had some sort of epiphany that that the world was flat because of something that contradicted the round world to them. The stubbornness on the issue is incredible though. Pictures and videos of earth from space aren't enough, the fact that physics wouldn't work the way it does doesn't matter, the obvious discrepancies that the flat earth model causes get glossed over... A lot of it gets attributed to I suppose the grandest conspiracy ever. I saw some post that exposing it would topple the corrupt nasa and government so maybe some of that is part of the motivation lol"
SubredditDrama,3dogeo,Sta-au,11,Sat Jul 18 08:10:21 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm a bit rusty on my biblical beliefs and my only real knowledge of this stuff has to do with archaeological works.. But where does it say anywhere in the Torah or New Testament that the world is flat? I mean I have extremely limited knowledge of this stuff but I don't recall anything about the shape of the world.  And I guess I was wrong about the Sumerians knowing the Earth was round.
SubredditDrama,3dogeo,TheFunBurglar,10,Sat Jul 18 09:39:18 2015 UTC,"It is mostly in Isaiah if I remember correctly, and really the whole thing depends on using translations derived from the King James Version (which has a few problems but that's another topic).  So for example you have:   Isaiah 40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in;   This is kind of an interesting passage, as you find it used both by flat earthers (claiming that it means a flat circle, not a sphere) as well as some Christian apologists (claiming it means ancient Israelities knew the earth was a sphere, and usually also asserting that they knew this before anyone else). The Hebrew term used (חוּג or chug) is kind of ambiguous, as it is variously translated as circle, vault, and horizon. For instance in Job 22:14, we have the original Hebrew: וְלֹ֣א יִרְאֶ֑ה וְח֥וּג שָׁ֝מַ֗יִם יִתְהַלָּֽךְ׃ Which is translated (in the KJV) as:   and he walketh in the circuit of heaven   But then you have the same line in the New American Standard bible as:   And He walks on the vault of heaven.   In other places in the bible you find the use of the term ""four corners of the earth"" or ""four quarters of the earth"". Interestingly enough, in Isaiah 11:12, this term is used - the same book that later describes the Earth as a circle. So we have:   He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.   The word translated as ""quarters"" is כַּנְפ֥וֹת, (kan·p̄ō·wṯ) which is variously translated as corners, quarters, or ends. The exact same word is used in Deuteronomy to describe fringes on the corners of sacred garments, for instance. That kind of implies something like a 2-dimensional surface that has defined corners, which obviously precludes a sphere.  There's also a lot of instances where the Earth is described as having pillars or foundations, which goes into a more three dimensional view of the Earth.  Just personal opinion, though, but I assume all this stuff is just poetic license on the part of the authors. They didn't really have any idea what the shape of the Earth was and probably didn't much care. One of the common denominators among ancient societies that had a good understanding of the shape of the earth was that they were concerned with things like astrology, and so were observing the skies and drawing conclusions from those observations. Sometimes they were also seafarers and were able to observe the curvature of the Earth. The ancient Israelites were pastoralists and relatively confined geographically. Astrology was regarded as a corrupting foreign influence (it is something foreign priests did). So most of what we see laid downed definitively is stuff about land use and how to distinguish yourself from your out-group neighbours, not detailed information on the motion of heavenly bodies."

There is still a pretty solid core of subscribers that are there for the slapfights and name calling and they tend to upvote the good content.

The only real way to keep a forum at that delicate equilibrium as it grows in size and attracts new members is to strictly enforce a high degree of civility, and remove comments that don't meet that standard. Not every forum really needs this, but if you want to keep interesting discussions happening and don't want an echo chamber, then that's precisely what you need.   aGG got caught in 1, where KiA and Ghazi went the other way."

That's the point.  If someone made an even more extreme statement that was meant to mock the sort of thing a racist would say about black people, there might be a chance it would be funny. Unfortunately, the watermelon joke, just like the attack helicopter copypasta, punch downwards at an oppressed group for no particular reason. It doesn't matter how much you exaggerate a dumb prejudicial statement, it's still a dumb prejudicial statement. The fact that the copypasta was originally created to mock GSM people and is very often brought up in issues surrounding gender and sexuality just makes it even more obvious it's not benign."

I believe I have the ability to laugh at a joke while still being accepting of trans issues. Others believe that the subject matter of a joke and its potential effect on others matters more. So, were basically at loggerheads. I'm not trying to defend my right to be shitty to others.

The point is that it would be absurd if someone did so identify.  But even if you dispute this (and so think that it wouldn't be absurd for someone to sexually identify as an attack helicopter), it seems to me that granting such an absurdity doesn't oblige anyone to think that all non-cis self-identifications are absurd, and so fails to be transphobic.  Of course, it could be used in a transphobic way or given a transphobic meaning (e.g. if it were meant to suggest that transgender self-identifications are like identifying as an attack helicopter), but I think the copypasta is silly enough to be funny on its own without any transphobic meaning, ala someone who claims ""Jedi"" as their religion.

Sure, but it doesn't have to be making fun of real-world self-identifications.  It could merely be making fun of a hypothetical absurd person who sexually identifies as an attack helicopter.  Like if someone wrote a joke about writing something silly in the religion box (and it might be funnier the more serious the hypothetical person is about the silly ""religion"").   I don't think it's reasonable to view the copypasta as existing in a vacuum. Even the people who vehemently defend its use acknowledge that it is making fun of something. It's parody, which inherently calls the legitimacy of the thing being parodied into question.   Sure, but you can parody Star Wars without thinking Star Wars sucks (see e.g. Eddie Izzard's funny Darth Vader routine).  You can parody religious identification with, say, Jedi self-identifications without thinking that all or most religious identifications are stupid.  Of course that doesn't mean this parody was crafted with such benign intentions, or that it is generally read with such benign meaning.  I'm no scholar on the subject, so I can't make any pronouncements on the matter.  But sexually identifying as an attack helicopter is a funny idea, because attack helicopters don't really have sexuality.  I see it as a funny category error, like religiously identifying as an asshole.

I'm religious and I enjoy religious parodies.  I'm Christian and I enjoy parodies of Christianity.  I like being challenged, and I like laughing.

The only way I see to avoid viewing that copypasta as transphobic is to think of it as completely separated from any reality. I don't think that's reasonable, since parody relies on referencing things that already exist.   Sure.  This copypasta, for instance, references sexual identification and attack helicopters.  I take sexual identification seriously, but I don't take sexual identification as an attack helicopter seriously.  And I find it interesting that sexually identifying as an attack helicopter is absurd (so not all sexual identifications are reasonable--it would be unreasonable to sexually identify as an attack helicopter), but that other kinds of sexual identifications aren't absurd.  It makes me want to figure out where the line goes (if there is a line at all) and why.  So not only do I not find this copypasta transphobic, I find it intellectually stimulating, and it makes me want to find out what principles of self-identification there are which affirm transgenderism but reject attack-helicopterism.  [It may be that the answer is trivial and my desire to know betrays a lack of rudimentary scholarship.]  Again, this is not to say that my reading is the majority reading of the copypasta.  Perhaps the general reading is that it's transphobic and hurtful/oppressive; perhaps it is generally used to mock transgendered people.    I think it's perfectly consistent to reject the claim that the copypasta is inherently transphobic (i.e., every reasonable interpretation is transphobic), since I think my interpretation is both reasonable and not transphobic, but to oppose its general use if the general reading or general purpose is transphobic."

People who have grown up have realized that ""it's just a joke"" is not a reasonable reply to bigoted humor. Period.   I'm not sure how this remark is relevant to my post, since I haven't argued that ""It's just a joke"" is a reasonable reply to bigoted humor.    Rather, I've argued that there is a reasonable interpretation of the text that isn't bigoted--but isn't necessarily a popular or widespread reading, nor the only reasonable interpretation, so that generally speaking the text may be given a bigoted meaning (and could be objected to on those grounds).  You see, the argument seems to be that the copypasta is inherently bigoted, such that every reasonable interpretation of it is bigoted.  This is the argument that I've been disputing.  I think it's important to distinguish objecting to the copypasta in situ, based on a particular usage/reading or a general collection of usages/readings, and objecting to the copypasta per se, that is regardless of context.    If the copypasta is inherently bigoted, then any interpretation is objectionable, being either bigoted or unreasonable, and thus one objects to the copypasta per se.  If the copypasta isn't inherently bigoted, then one objects to it only when it is issued or read with a bigoted interpretation (and this may indeed characterize the majority of instances of the copypasta).  But the objections are different in principle, since the in situ objection considers context while the per se objection needn't consider context."

Hell, I don't recall Riot or Valve putting subscription requirements to view in source quality.  Unless evo is in very bad financial situation, $12 is overpriced.

SubredditDrama,3dpl4q,PenisEngineMechanic,2,Sun Jul 19 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"The difference for the OGN stream is that the money was directly going to casters, and the translators. That money was basically going directly to running the show because it was a completely new department with no sponsor, and no real money. EVO has been financially stable ever since EVO was really a thing. Every year they have huge ass sponsorships on a grand scale, for a fighting game at least, and every sponsor from big to small clamoring to be a part of it. EVO brings in a lot of money every year, the head of EVO doesn't even work, he just waits until the next EVO every year and cruises solely off that. To me at least, The only time I've seen EVO struggle was when Melee got confirmed for EVO and they needed like 500 CRTs, which Red Bull(?) stepped in and helped them out. With all these sponsors, and all the money coming in, and the amount of money they are dealing out as EVO is one of the lowest paying majors almost always, There is literally no reason for this to be a thing. And At least OGN's payment was 7.99. 11.99 just to watch high quality is pretty steep. And dont say they need money to run the stream, there are so many streamers who would do it totally for free no strings attached."

I can make quesadillas any time I want to, with tortillas, butter, cheese and chicken. The chicken I keep around in the freezer because it's a good thing to take out, cook it up with poultry seasoning, and put in the fridge to make a bunch of meals out of.   Now if you wanted to make a picture perfect chipotle burrito, it would probably cost more.  I guess my point is, unless you are going to a really good Mexican restaurant, you can make versions yourself cheaper at home. Though I have a really hard time finding good Mexican restaurants.

Also   Sour cream (though I don't put this on anymore)   Yeah it's slightly bland but fuck, Chipotle is actually comparatively cheap compared to other fast food chains. $7 ($9 with double meat) for a 1000 Calorie meal, with way more nutritional variety than a burger+fries/McDonalds, and a easy way to hit your macros. I don't really know of anywhere else that uses relatively high quality ingredients at low cost. I think the best thing about Chipotle is the subtle taste where it doesn't taste like crappy Fast Food.  Also, Chipotle is the fastest fast food you can get. They will make that burrito for you in 30 seconds without a line. If you go to McDonald's, or Burger King, or Taco Bell, or anything else, you can be waiting for like 10 minutes. The only reason you wait at Chiptotle is if the place is packed with a line out the door.

It's not super authentic, but for white people concerned with authenticity, they can hold it above Taco Bell for the sake of it not having Dorito shells, liquid cheese, etc. and also hold it above Taco Bell on health matters. They heavily promote themselves as a socially conscious company as well, which a lot of people like- they try VERY hard to make it known that they use recycled paper for napkins, organic produce, antibiotic-free meat, etc.   All that said, I myself like Chipotle well enough, though I haven't had it in years. The barbacoa meat is quite nice as I recall, and I'm a fan of the vegetarian burrito bowls, as you get free guacamole along with some good grilled peppers and onions."

SubredditDrama,3domc1,TruePrep1818,3,Sat Jul 18 01:37:16 2015 UTC,Socialist economies tended to be a lot more environmentally destructive per unit of economic output. It's fairly hard to avoid given that socialist economies couldn't really improve on efficiency in the way capitalist economies could - thus growth had to focus on increasing inputs.

SubredditDrama,3domc1,KnightModern,8,Sat Jul 18 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"You should read Murray Bookchin.   Modern industrial civilization is inherently destructive on one level or another, but a major difference is that capitalism is a system that is centered around two things: one is unlimited growth and expansion, and the other is profit.   The first means that capitalism is going to constantly require more and more resources to stay afloat, and the latter means that cutting corners by say, dumping waste in a river, is smart business sense.   Socialism, specifically more libertarian variants of it, is by contrast a large scaling down of the economy and a restructuring of it based on sustainability and human need rather then on generating a profit."

I'd guess that the fact that pre-industrial humans lived more sustainably was just because we didn't have the ability to completely exhaust most resources without heavy industry.

SubredditDrama,3domc1,foodlibrary,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but you're wrong. The transition was supposed to be capitalism to socialism, accumulating enough capital to start redistribution and ownership reform as the entire idea from the start. Marx believed that just how capitalism took a transition from purely artisan markets to factories, so would socialism take the transition from factories to workers cooperatives.   The transition is from capitalism to socialism to communism. They weren't orthodox marxists either. The orthodox marxists were the mensheviks, and they lost and probably exiled or killed later on.    The idea was that only capitalist nations can transition towards socialism because only capitalism can promise the amount of growth necessary to propel humanity. However, the efficiency saw a set back when it interfered with everyday life for the sake of profit. Marx saw that as a necessary evil. Then the transition to socialism could occur.   Yes, that is an orthodox marxist belief. However, Lenin and the bolsheviks believed that revolution could occur in backwater countries, like Russia. Russia was a feudal society inhabited by land hoeing peasants. This belief probably came from the failure of the socialist revolution in Germany, which Marx saw as the best place for revolution due to its level of industrialization.   Now here's the important part, the nations that always referred to themselves as communist or socialist always ended up being either state capitalist nations or centrally planned nations. Why? Because they never transitioned to capitalism in the first place, they never expanded and felt the irony of it all like western Europe had faced. Instead, they preferred central planning.   1: socialism and central planning aren't mutually exclusive theoretically, and probably aren't in reality unless you believe the state is inherently exploitative and nondemocratic. And as much as state capitalism is used to critique these states, its probably better to call them degenerated workers states.  State capitalism is the plan that Lenin initially put the USSR on to compensate for not being capitalist. It should have gone for 60 years, but Stalin ended it early. State capitalism also refers to current countries like China, which operate for profit.     Sadly, none of them did. I for one, am a socialist, and I support markets, but not capitalism since the two aren't intrinsic.   Are you a market socialist?"

SubredditDrama,3domc1,Ragark,4,Sat Jul 18 07:42:51 2015 UTC,"Socialism is a system of ownership concerning workers cooperatives in an economy that can run like a market economy or purely democratic society.   While it's true that many socialists advocate this model, it isn't the sole definition of socialism.   According to Marx, socialism would involve the administration of a state that takes the product of labour to recoup the losses of production, further expand production, fund public services, and then distribute the remainder to workers on the basis of their labour time. None of this necessitates workers cooperatives, or even a democratic state.  Of course Marx isn't the be all and end all of socialist thought, but claiming decentralised networks of workers cooperatives is the sole definition of socialist society is just as baseless as Marxist-Leninists who declare that the vanguard state is the sole definition of socialist society."
SubredditDrama,3domc1,rrrrrrt,3,Sat Jul 18 09:14:36 2015 UTC,"But the transitional state is socialism. I think Marx is quite clear on that.

I'm quite aware of what libertarian, democratic and market variants of socialism entail. These simply aren't the sole agreed upon definition of socialism, nor are they necessarily the historically most common definition of socialism. It's true that this is a definition most commonly accepted by socialists in the first world, I might accept that, but on a global scale models of state based socialism are much more common in the developing world (which outnumber first world socialists by a pretty great deal).  Again, I'm not saying libertarian socialism is an illegitimate form, or that state directed models are necessarily in any way better. I'm just saying that the idea that libertarian, democratic or market oriented socialism are the only and most definitive definition of socialism is on its face a ridiculous claim and not much better than a ""no true Scotsman"" argument.  I'm sure you'd find it particularly offensive if a Marxist-Leninist was to tell you that vanguard state directed socialism was the only form of socialism. Yet you're making basically the exact same argument here as they would be.  You're perfectly free to advocate this particular model of socialism, more power to you if you choose to do so. You have no basis to claim that it is the only possible variant, to the extent of it being the very definition of socialism, though."

I am directly referencing the Critique of the Gotha Programme, in which Marx quite explicitly lays out the necessity of the state in the transitional period, and details the function of the state as distributing the products of labour.  There is simply nothing in Marx's thought that suggests socialism necessitates a lack of centralisation, the presence of direct democracy, or networks of worker owned cooperatives. That's not to say socialism can't look like any of these things - of course it can - but it could also look like a single party state."

I'm not sure where you're basing this claim from. Marx was above all a pragmatist in political concerns - he repeatedly qualified that any claim he made about what socialism would look like would be subject to the contingencies of the society it arose in. He pretty much abjectly refused to lay out a particular definitive model of socialism because he understood that the material realities of socialism wouldn't be something that he could easily predict. One of the most fundamental points of his thought was his refusal to engage in utopian planning of a future society.  Any attempt to claim that a form of socialism best suits Marx's vision - from decentralised, democratic workers communes to the vanguard party-state - is inherently flawed."

It's of course not the only system that can have skewed incentives, as we saw with authoritarian state socialism.   The short version is that under capitalism, as a business manager you have a strong incentive to make quarterly profit forecasts and a much less strong incentive to think about the 50-year sustainability of your business practices. If you use a discount rate of 5%, the monetary value of solving a problem that happens 50 years from now is only about 9% of the value of solving a problem happening right now. In an anarchist world, say, people would be much more free to focus on the concerns of their children and so on."

But that's not some perverse incentive invented by capitalism. Positive interest rates reflect a reality - resources can be invested to create more resources in the future. Spending right now to fix a future problem has to be weighed against investing the money for a while and then having more resources to solve it.  This is something that a rational decision maker takes into account whether they're trying to make money as a business or trying to survive on a deserted island - time value is not unique to any system or situation, it's basic resource management."
SubredditDrama,3domc1,NeedsMoreReeds,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"But that's not some perverse incentive invented by capitalism.   But it is. The logic of markets under capitalism makes the distinction between applications where discount rates should be used and applications where they should not be used pretty foggy. Not everything is directly translatable into a monetary cost, which makes such calculations go wildly off base. For sustainable practices to be effective, they need to rely on more than just calculations of the Net Present Value of solving problems.  Again, I only gave the short form of the argument. There's obviously more to it than that."

When you're talking about public goods like environment and resources, it's pretty hard to deal with that in any sort of capitalist idea. You need government and democracy."

SubredditDrama,3domc1,maxthegeek1,0,Sat Jul 18 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"For proponents of that argument, the situation is worse than that. It's pretty clear that the major societal ideas, reforms and institutions that led to science as an extremely productive force were being put into place during the Renaissance, quite a bit before capitalism as we understood it existed. At best, whatever form of dominant political economy that exists, unless completely totalitarian and anti-science (or completely terrible at allocating resources), would only make changes at the margins of scientific thought.  But yeah, an extremely large amount of basic math and science research (and even applied math and science research) and even larger amounts of social science research have been publicly funded in the last century or so, meaning that the question of the ownership of the means of production has been kind of irrelevant in that respect.  Capitalists have to argue that private ownership of the means of production combined with the institution of wage labor is the primary driver of new scientific thought, which is pretty laughable in almost every respect when you think about it. It might be true when it comes to having lots of brands of TVs, but it's a pretty good bet the basic science of the TV was not done by some researcher looking to make huge profits.

My issue is that a lot of people just assume all socialism is Marxist-Leninism, which it most assuredly is not. So whenever I get into a discussion about these issues I end up having a bunch of people scream about the soviet union to me, even though I'm an anarchist and the soviet union has absolutely nothing to do with what I actually believe. And even when I make that point as clear as day people still go on about Stalin and shit.   It's tiring, let me put it that way.

Surely if people believe that X is bad and Y is good, and others who broadly fall within the same political group as them happened to do or say X, then they'd be hypocrities or ineffectual assholes if they gave them a pass due to a weird tribal affiliation?"

Ever seen that show? The guys there are paired with very beautiful women that have a lot going for them   This is where things start to get weird.  I'm pretty sure the concept of the matchmaking show is that Person A seeking ""a relationship"" is often gigantically stunted either socially or emotionally, and has to be profusely coached toward how to act and appear around other human beings of the same/opposite sex.  And the bevy of willing ""dates"" are not exactly upwardly mobile SVP's taking a break from ball-busting on the trading floor to get a blow out and pose seductively for the camera.

Is it just the first ""dateable"" woman he sees? Does he find a group of dateable women and message them all? Or randomly select from that pool?  I'm guessing that he's implicitly ranking them on some scale, even if he is loathe to assign a number to it.

Conversely, I know plenty of women that are interesting but I wouldn't date simply because I'm not sexually attracted to them (whyever) but I'm good friends with.

What they do show is women being held to a higher standard - the same standard as men. For instance, if some women talk shit about short guys, those women shouldn't be suprised if men turn round and make comments about their weight. Men shouldn't make rude comments about women's weight, and women shouldn't make rude comments about guys' height. If men creep on or sexually assault women, they should expect to get called out, and vice versa. It's simple really."

You immoral assclowns obviously aren’t grown up enough to make these decisions by yourselves. This should be a motherfucking apology you scumbags.   Comment with 900-some stars.  Edit: And another comment framing it as a hit on reddit's credibility!   The article was an unconscionable attack on a low-profile gay man and his family, because he is the CFO of Gawker’s rival company and Reddit-owners Conde Nast. Gawker’s attack only worked, because we live in a world where LGBTQ people are still seen as shameful, undeserving of families, and their sexual endeavors are considered taboo. The attack relied upon a fringe far-right homophobic blackmailer, who seeks out targets with the intention of outing them as gay. Indeed, Gawker’s extortionist believes that Obama retroactive caused 9/11, that Sodomites are causing natural disasters, and Other Strange Tales. The Daily Caller got an exclusive interview with the man that Gawker used to out an LGBTQ person in hiding.  The article followed a series of articles over the past week, assailing Conde Nast’s Reddit property for its (admittedly sometimes bigoted) readership and its policies. But the timing and nature of this hit piece against Conde Nast’s CFO makes all of this seem especially suspect. Apparently, when calling your opponents bigoted doesn’t work, you use 1970s-style media shaming tactics, targeting its leadership for their sexuality.

The ""nerds rule the world"" thing is silly whether it's from nerds or about them, but the rest of the point is essentially Gamergate 101: if you're offended by what someone says, it doesn't matter, you're just being offended to be offended.

It's important to recognize the distinction, but at the same time the only people I've seen ever seriously try to call for some kind of divorce of the T from the LGBT movement are a) LGB people who don't want to make their fight harder so to speak, understandable but unfortunate, b) actually transphobic, or c) trans people who hurl around ""cis"" as an insult.

SubredditDrama,3dlkm8,SJHalflingRanger,7,Fri Jul 17 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's see how concise I can make this. When Gamergate was still in its planning stage on 4chan/IRC, #NotYourShield was envisioned as a companion hashtag. Their worry was that SJWs win all debates because saying ""we represent women and minorities, checkmate white males"" is an automatic win. The idea of NYS is that it would appear to be an independent hashtag that represented minorities, saying critics of Gamergate didn't represent them.  It's not commented on that much anymore by outside observers, but if you ever go on Twitter you'll see almost all Gamergate content still uses the NYS hashtag as well as GG. In practice it's just  Gamergate under a different brand name, and seldom mentioned outside of gater circles."

But it was also flooded with new Twitter accounts that used pictures of minorities they got from stock images or new stories. By the time I heard of GG last September, NYS was written off as all sockpuppets. Which wasn't entirely fair, but has a large element of truth to it.  NYS continues to work in the sense that gaters themselves talk about it a lot and use it for internal propaganda.

Well here is a link to a dictionary entry saying it is a transistor, are mechanics hateful now? Words have different meanings based on context. In this context it is meant describe a transgender person, not a car part. But I don't think it is hateful. I didn't even know it was a derogatory term. Yes, which is exactly why I just told you that it is But I don't think it is derogatory Whether or not you think it is is irrelevant, it is considered derogatory by transgenders people But I don't think it is derogatory, stop trying to censor me.

SubredditDrama,3dm10c,pitaenigma,7,Fri Jul 17 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I dislike most of the characters in Breaking Bad.  Walt quickly shows himself to be an asshole. Skyler is kinda bitchy in season 1, even though we symphatize with her in later seasons. Marie is terrible, but it would probably be spoilers for someone not past season 1. Hank is a racist asshole. Jesse is an addict that constantly screws up. Etc.  But, the story is good enough for me to easily be able to move past the dislikeable characters. All seasons work together so well.

I don't mind characters being evil but Frank and Walter are just so banal and human. Their motivations are like anyone elses but they're just not able to stop.   It puts me off.

Not, I think, because it was emblematic of Don's inherent cowardice or because he took another man's life and had been lying to everyone about it. No, simply because not being an actual war hero meant that Don didn't live up to his caveman ideal of what a man should be. It was hilarious. After watching an entire season of Don being a generally awful person in his personal life and the show very clearly showing the ramifications of that, he was turned off because of one of the more understandable things Don did (I don't think the show really blames Don for what happened in Korea, his home life was pretty awful)."
SubredditDrama,3dm10c,Treeducks,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"That seemed to be a pretty common way of watching mad men, in a way it kinda makes sense because it's way more subtle and below the surface than most TV shows people normally are exposed to, and there's also a surface-level look and narrative that seems really glitzy and appealing. I love the show but I know when I first watched season 1 I was missing tons of the subtleties and real stuff going on under the surface, just getting drawn along by the period look and all the drinking/smoking/sex. Back when it started it caused a fair amount of buzz but it never captured a huge audience, and it may just have been that most people didn't get it. It's something of a spiritual successor to the sopranos, and while that show was way more popular, it also definitely had people watching it more for the mob/violence stuff than for any subtleties or character stuff going on under the surface."
SubredditDrama,3dm10c,123456789075,4,Sat Jul 18 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"God the Sopranos was a great show. It's weird, but despite being a huge part of the reason there is so much good TV right now (Breaking Bad and Mad Men objectively wouldn't exist if the Sopranos hadn't come first) the Sopranos doesn't get talked about all that much anymore. Like everyone's seen or heard of the Wire, but there doesn't seem to be that much of a clamor to celebrate the Sopranos. I think the fact that it wasn't on when there were a lot of people writing reviews on the internet, as well as the fact that a lot of today's cultural tastemakers were being read Harry Potter while it was on has a lot to do with it."
SubredditDrama,3dm10c,Treeducks,3,Fri Jul 17 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"The Sopranos was also HBO's first big show, they weren't really known for much beyond movies and the occasional stand-up special. Combined with the internet not being very big back then probably helps explain why it isn't as talked about these days. I definitely remember it being pretty popular when it was still on the air, but even then it was to a niche audience because most people didn't have HBO or didn't care enough to watch with someone who did. Now you can just borrow someone's HBO-Go info or watch through more illicit means when all else fails.  I just wish OZ had been half as popular as The Sopranos, I fuckin' love OZ."

Don't get me wrong, he definitely was in it for very selfish reasons and many times put his family second but he's neither completely a villain or an anti-hero."

It's clear from forums like this reddit one that a lot of people still do."
SubredditDrama,3dm10c,EmergencyChocolate,7,Fri Jul 17 17:32:25 2015 UTC,"I know Vince described the show once as one where ""the protagonist becomes the antagonist"", and also that in contrast to most TV shows, where the main character can stay the same person season after season, he wanted to experiment with one who constantly changed. Who knows if he had one particular moment in mind when the viewers would turn, but I think you're pretty much right, that he'd start off with a character who's somewhat sympathetic and then keep dragging him down through the mud until no one could possible still like him, but he obviously underestimated dudebro redditers and their ability to root for a monster."

I'll avoid Godwining this discussion but many of the worst people in recorded history loved and cared for their spouses and children.    Walter is completely a villain.  That he occasionally cared for his family didn't stop him from destroying several others.

She definitely bears some culpability for playing along with Walter (she admits as much herself at the end of the series) but as far as the main cast goes she is objectively one of the least terrible people. Only Hank and Marie come out looking better than her in the end. Well, Junior too (is he even prominent enough to be considered a main character?)  A lot of the hatred is definitely informed by misogyny, but part of it is that we are set up to dislike her from jump, as a way to hoodwink us into liking Walt. Her portrayal in the first season is so clearly and deliberately meant to make the audience dislike her that I can't believe anyone here really doesn't understand it (even if they didn't fall for it themselves).   The hate is also partly due to the fact that Skyler represents the main source of family drama in the show, and plenty of viewers found it boring compared to the meth drama. So they identified their boredom with Skyler, and started to hate her for ""getting in Walt's way"" (read: getting in the way of the interesting action).   In all it's a shame because it's pretty clear that your sympathy for Skyler is supposed to be in inverse proportion to your sympathy for Walt, and many, many people missed the point completely."

Walt tries to throw the potted plant into his window to break in but it's too heavy so he awkwardly drags it over to the window and then tips it over as he's trying to pick it up. Little things like that are totally how I feel half the time I try to do anything in public."

SubredditDrama,3dm10c,aceavengers,6,Sat Jul 18 03:00:30 2015 UTC,Is alcohol good for a child at any point? Critical for child development? Provide any nutritional value to the mother or child? Then there will always be a group of people who perceive drinking while pregnant as a selfish act.  Parents are expected to make sacrifices for the best interest of their children and to anyone who is not suffering from alcoholism sobriety for eight or so months in pursuit of the protection of one's child is a simple matter.

Alcohol should be viewed the same way as all other medications a woman may take during pregnancy (or any other time): what is the risk/reward trade-off? A fetus won't die from one glass of wine, but high cortisol (stress hormone) may affect birth weight and obesity risk even into adulthood, or the mother and the fetus may die from eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure), not to mention the intangible effects of general, chronic stress on relationships.  And from a more ethically murky perspective (one I happen to agree with), a woman doesn't relinquish the right to make her own medical decisions just because she's pregnant, especially when there's no evidence that small amounts of alcohol are dangerous during late-stage pregnancy.  I'm not a mother, and I don't think I personally would choose to drink during pregnancy, but I damn sure would continue taking my anti-depressant!"

Her husband is a kingpin meth manufacturer and repeatedly puts his family in danger and has had a few opportunities to walk away with a decent amount of money, but doesn't because of his pride. He's responsible for several deaths. She fucks Ted while they were in the process of getting divorced. He's arguably rapey toward Skylar in at least one, maybe two scenes.   But hey, she's the one who's a cunt and Walt's the badass.  And yes, I know about how they portray him as sympathetic as he is the main character and all that. It's still annoying to see people shit on Skylar because it's ""cool"" to hate on the bitchy wife.

SubredditDrama,3dm10c,obnoxiouslybigrobot,5,Fri Jul 17 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. Does disliking Skylar give a platform for misogynists to spout off, sure, but I don't think disliking her character means you are automatically one. I think the writers purposefully made her unlikable. At least in the first season. She was basically a caricature of a nagging, over-bearing wife. Even before Walt started his spiral into evil criminal mastermind, he comments that he's never able to make any choices in his own life. Skylar basically is so domineering that Walt felt suffocated.   I think the writers had to set her up that way to get you on Walt's side from the beginning. As the show progressed, they gave her some character development, and her actions seemed to be more justified once she found out what Walt was doing. But before that she was just awful for almost no reason."

When the show starts, everyone in Walt's life is kind of thoughtlessly awful.  Skyler, Hank, Walter Jr., anyone he deals with in a professional capacity, they're all making him feel small, even if in later seasons they don't seem to be the kind of people who would do that.  Skyler can be combative, but you don't really see the kind of nagging and dismissiveness she does at first in later seasons.  Hank comes across as bullying Walt even at Walt's own birthday party, but we later learn Hank likes and respects Walt a lot.  Besides setting up Walt as a sympathetic protagonist, I almost wonder if the reason they're so relatively nasty at first is that we're meant to be seeing it subjectively from Walt's point of view, so we're seeing these generally normal, nice people through Walt's lens of resentment and misery."
SubredditDrama,3dm10c,ArtSchnurple,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:45 2015 UTC,I don't think it goes as deep as that. It's just a case of the showrunners still trying to find a foothold on their characters in the first season.

We only ban people for comments they make within the subreddit (or for pissing, of course).   You are the same mods who permabanned that other user based on a screenshot of their interaction with IrbyTremor, via PMs. That was not a comment within the subreddit.  I mean, that was a good call in my humble opinion, I don't want the people like them around. But I don't want the people like IrbyTremor around either, and if it was OK to ban the former, it should also be OK and actually desirable to ban the latter as well. Based on the very same screenshot that you did the the first banning on.  You don't even need my word that she is she because in the screenshot she's on her current account."

Maybe you should post what the original ban was for then.  Because it really looks shifty as fuck, you know?  Like, the some user over there is, ""Oh you were banned, here's a PM screenshot showing that you're a horrible racist"". Strongly implying that that's why they were banned. And also implying that they are an alt of some mod, because they have that modmail screenshot, or maybe some mod leaked it to them, I don't know. The fact is that it's a modmail screenshot.  Now you here are, ""Oh, disregard that screenshot, it had nothing to do with their banning, we banned them for ban evasion"".  Well, which was it then?  For the record, again, I don't have any problem with that user being banned. I have a problem with IrbyTremor not being banned at the same time or at all despite the blatant homophobia, and I'm beginning to have a problem with the modteam playing tricks with me.

It's been so long I had to look him up in our ban system to double check.    Well, which was it then?   Hmm, I'm going to go with the facts stated by the person who can actually see the ban histories and notes over random commenters speculating and getting in a tizzy with zero information.   We're not banning anyone for shit they say in other subs or other subs' modmail, so please don't perpetuate that. We're not the morality police. We strictly enforce our own rules, in our own sub. If he had been a racist ass in SRD he would have been banned for that. But not for doing it elsewhere."

There's a definite difference between he and she in Mandarin, even if it's only one radical. It'd certainly make me raise an eyebrow, at least! Incidentally, did you know that to make a gender-neutral pronoun, Chinese netizens write ""ta"" in Latin characters? I thought that was weird and mildly uncomfortable because it's just two Latin characters amongst a bunch of Chinese ones.   Japanese also has he and she, but they're not so commonly used, like most non-first person pronouns. Generally people refer to each other by name whenever the circumstances permit, and 彼 (he) & 彼女 (she) meaning ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" respectively don't really help.  It's a similar situation with German and Freund/Freundin, they mean friend but can also mean boyfriend/girlfriend.

People start to question OP's legitimacy (even if it later turns out to be true).  OP gets submitted to /r/quityourbullshit, /r/thathappened, etc.   Here's where the cycle splits:  a. OP responds to the people questioning their validity.   b. OP doesn't respond at all.   Under option 'a', the post gets submitted to the various drama subs and maybe even /r/bestof again (which repeats the cycle). If they say anything particularly funny, they might have a brief spurt of popularity on /r/circlejerk. A particularly dedicated poster might even release an update during peak contrarianism, further lengthening the cycle.   Under option 'b', people forget about it pretty quickly and nothing else really happens.   This happens at least once a week, if not daily. It was entertaining for a little while, but now I mostly focus on the first two steps -- it's way more positive and fun. Even if it turns out to be a troll, you'll still help people out, so it's not a big deal."

But more specifically than language, I figure if they just arrived 2 years ago, and their English is not good and they don't have money, they're not going to be on Reddit.

You can, however, potentially sue them in cases where they have explicitly or impliedly waived their immunity. The issue is finding a court that is willing to hear the case and that has jurisdiction. There are some situations where by entering into a commercial agreement they agree that you should have remedy for breach of contract, BUT the NY courts usually refuse to hear pretty much any case with a few exceptions.

OP isn't my client, and i really don't care if OP is lying. I go off what's presented in the post, and if OP gets inapplicable advice because they didn't give the full story, that's OP's problem. Not that being honest guarantees good information on that sub anyway... a fair chunk of terrible advice gets bandied around, supported in large part (I would hope...) by non-lawyer votes.  In any case, it's not always in someone's interest to hang even all their good facts out for all to see in advance of litigation.

Like, there's a middle ground you know. You can take 15 seconds out of your life to extend the very basic graces of decorum to your server, and I can guarantee that the vast majority of servers would be totally fine with that and totally ready to NOT be talking to you.

Little pleasantries like ""I'm good, you?"" or just the please and thank you routine you should have learned in kindergarten serve a purpose, in that they mark you as a polite and pleasant member of society. And when something does go wrong, being pleasant and polite is a good way to motivate people to want to fix the issue.   Like, there was a new takeout place in my neighborhood a few years ago, and as with any new place, they hadn't gotten their footing yet. The shouty rude lady in front of me got her order fixed. But being pleasant and polite about asking for the part of mine that was left out also scored me a free slice of cheesecake.

If the food takes too long, that isn't the waiters fault; if your food isn't cooked how you wanted it, that isn't the waiters fault.  There are pretty much no reasons to be rude to a waiter, even if they are rude to you, (which they almost never are, in my experience) you should take the high ground and still be polite.  Idk, I feel bad when I'm rude to people, even if they didn't deserve my politeness.  I guess some people don't."

SubredditDrama,3dmhvi,DerangedDesperado,6,Fri Jul 17 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"WITH TIPS they make minimum wage.  Most waiters make like 3 bucks and hour as a wage from their employer.  EDIT: My point is, is that if everyone thought that they didn't need to tip, then waiters wouldn't be making jack shit for money.  I wasn't trying to say that if you get annoyed with a waiter and leave a smaller tip or w/e that you're literally hitler and ruining the waiters life.  I realized that my initial comments weren't as clear as I thought they were.  With that being said, I still just generally leave 15% no matter what."
SubredditDrama,3dmhvi,MisdemeanorOutlaw,3,Fri Jul 17 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yes thats what i said. Thats what they're making. Thats with people stiffing them or whatever. Quit your job taking tips making close to twenty bucks and hour and join up a job at wal mart or something. Youll be wanting to go  back to dealing with jerks making twice as much pretty quick. Fact is, youre getting tips, some people might not and people act like its the worst god damned thing in the world. Most people in the US do tip. I'd be willing to wager, fore the most part, that the people that over tip at least come close to breaking even than those that dont. Most waitstafff that ive gone out with have over tipped imo, usually aroudn 30 percent or so.   So yes, with tips they're making good money and you can average out their earnings and come up with how much they're making an hour. Where it comes from doesnt matter.   Also, letes not forget that if you for some reason fall below the minimum wage the employer is supposed to make that up but honestly, how often does that happen?   Waitstaff minimum wage changes by state too, here in illinois its 4.90 an hour so if you just do one table an hour and get five bucks your're already making over illinois minimum wage."

SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,Darren_Carrigan,7,Fri Jul 17 12:35:34 2015 UTC,I'm still lost.
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,nethodsod,4,Fri Jul 17 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Well, instead of looking at just one post someone else selected for you (which is ironically the sort of media controlling behavior the sub is against) you could go there and look at posts by a couple different posters.  The subreddit is essentially the intersection of occult philosophy and postmodern philosophers like Deleuze. This gives you posts where people discuss the symbolic problems of capitalist (or other) structures of society, and the way in which symbols, signs, and language in general influence our thoughts. These are often done in an academically playful way.  Here are a few posts that exemplify this. One of them is by me, so it may be biased...  https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3c7d1j/trinity_or_lilith_a_metaphilosophical_foray_into/ https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3c848t/cultural_all_too_cultural/ https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3d1e6n/why_antiauthoritarians_are_diagnosed_as_mentally/"
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,Darren_Carrigan,12,Fri Jul 17 13:35:45 2015 UTC,See that sounds cool. But when I'm clicking it just seems like people are over complicating their posts to seem more important.  Feels like most of the sub should be on /r/iamverysmart
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,nethodsod,-2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, the kind of person who gets into either postmodern philosophy or ""real"" occultism, tends to think they are very smart. They are, at least, usually very educated.  A lot of the posts are overcomplicated. That is a feature of both occultism and postmodernism, but not without reason. I'd suggest that there are two paths to stripping away cultural meaning, excess and deficit.   An explosion of neologisms and serpentine sentences will force you to grapple with the words directly, rather than take them at face value. Take a look at http://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/1024finn1.htm.  Alternatively, one can become so spartan in their tongue, that a single word becomes all inclusive. This is like the extreme minimalism of the Zen Buddhist who, when asked what Buddha nature was, said, ""Mu,"" which translates to ""not,"" or ""nothing.""  I won't judge the actual value of the posts for you. Not everyone is as well spoken as Deleuze, Joyce, or Crowley. But all three of them made a maximalist style work for them, and so the people that like their thoughts, will likely also attempt to imitate their style, even if they aren't very good at it."
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,Darren_Carrigan,4,Fri Jul 17 14:16:05 2015 UTC,I'm beginning to see what you're getting at. Guess it isn't for me. Maybe because I can't Reddit for longer than a minute or two. (Work redditor) so I'm a fan of posts and subs which get to the point
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,Impassionata,2,Fri Jul 17 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this type of literate subreddit requires that you do the whole swish all the words around in your mouth and see what you spit out thing.  ""The point"" of someone's lengthy screed may not be what you choose to react to or take away, if you can even divine what they're saying at all.  (Sometimes it is a bit like taking an essay as a dream.)    Creative weirdness also doesn't arrange itself that imperatively."

SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,nethodsod,5,Fri Jul 17 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"Well, occultists I'd like to call legitimate don't take their mythical metaphors literally. Some do, of course, but many more take a Jungian route, wherein Ares might exemplify the active warlike aspect of both one's own mind, and the universe at large.  You could set up a ritual like you suggested, waving a wand as generative genital over the rhizome, the macrocosmic universe in all it's unlayered layers, to spread the seed of your will through some symbolic field of play.  But if you aren't blindsided by the smoke and mirrors, it's the same as acting out poetry of the mind, like the ancient Greek actors who became, invoked, the gods they played.  ...  More to your question, western mystery tradition occultism attempts to offer solutions to many of the problems that postmodernism opens up.

SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,nethodsod,11,Fri Jul 17 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"So... Yes.   More to your question, western mystery tradition occultism attempts to offer solutions to many of the problems that postmodernism opens up.   Please elaborate, I am entirely fascinated, although I must confess also completely unable to take you seriously.   At the very least, it presents a way to create and control your own mind in a world where everything is a sign constantly being reinterpreted by your culture for its own, often consumerist, ends.

SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,RawbHaze,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate, I am entirely fascinated, although I must confess also completely unable to take you seriously.   You shouldn't! Part of the point of postmodernism is to be suspicious of ""grand narratives"" that explain how the world is and ought to be.  I would like to point out that I don't approach magick in the hypothetical way I presented. I practice a sort of free form shamanism that happens to use western symbols. Mostly it's for aesthetic inspiration (I'm an artist, musician, and writer), and to work through emotional or philosophical issues I have with my life.   What? But all you're doing is latching on to another set of signs, same as every counterculture.   There are two key differences. The first is that this set of signs, unless you join some sort of occult organization, is totally personal. It's self dictated, and is thus not used by some ""other"" culture to manipulate you. You use it to manipulate yourself.  The second is that you are aware that that's what you're doing, and you're doing it because you realize that thought and communication are impossible without signs. A lot of people don't realize the myriad ways their culture and use of language directs their thought, so they just go along with it.  Again, I can't speak for anyone else, but the general gist is that, if you want to understand another person, you've got to understand the way they use signs. If you want to understand yourself. You've got to understand the way you use signs. You need to be able to jump between networks of signs, in order to avoid becoming trapped in one. And it seems that you can't leave signs altogether, without ceasing to be."

It's not an -ism in that sense.    totally personal   There is literally no such thing. In fact such a thing is an impossibility; meaning is always and inherently social."
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,Theotropho,2,Fri Jul 17 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"What? No. Postmodernism doesn't have a point. It's not an -ism in that sense.   For postmodernism in general, as in anything after modernism, you're definitely right. However, and perhaps I should have been clearer, I was talking about postmodern philosophy (like Deleuze) and critical theory.  The most essential element of postmodern philosophy is the denial of grand narratives, or in literary terms, ""the death of the author."" I won't lecture you about it, but Lyotard's ""The Postmodern Condition"" is an excellent, short, and academically respected book that describes the most fundamental features of postmodern philosophy.   There is literally no such thing. In fact such a thing is an impossibility; meaning is always and inherently social.   Sure. But totally personally created? You can get pretty close. You could invent a language, as many have done, and then develop a world view within that language. Arguably, that's what Kelly and Dee did with their Enochian system of magick.  Wittgenstein also wrote a bit about personal languages, modes of meaning making only known to a single person. But I haven't actually read a whole work of Wittgenstein, so I'll refrain from going further into that."

If you want to understand yourself first do so without signs.  Johnny Naturehack Merril could show you the world."
SubredditDrama,3dm0sp,farbarismo,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, I used to practice what chaos magick. I got tired of Carroll brand magick though, since in constantly switching between systems of signs, you don't really work the symbols very far into your mind. And I think doing so is very important if one is to have particularly ""meaningful"" dreams or visions.   Further, I do actually study traditional works. I just don't automatically agree with them. I'd like to think I'm a little more structured than jerking off over doodles and wishing for more money.   If you want to understand yourself first do so without signs.   I would argue that it is impossible to understand anything without signs. Information is in-formation, to use a Joycean pun. Information arises from organization. One needs symbols and signs to have any sort of meaning. To be totally free of signs might be like nirvanna, or total abolition of mind. Not inherently a bad thing, but not precisely what I use magick for.   Johnny Naturehack Merril could show you the world.   Just googled him. He certainly looks interesting, but I'm not seeing him doing anything without signs, at least at a cursory glance. It looks like he has made a new set of signs.   Is there a certain article or video that you were thinking of?"

SubredditDrama,3dk98f,chaanach,14,Fri Jul 17 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"A couple things, though I don't presume to know the mind of Yishan Wong:   I don't know if you've ever spent time with successful entrepreneurs but I've had the privilege. They are very, very smart, and you don't become CEO of a company like Reddit without being the best of the best, especially if you're a minority. Everyone underestimates how tremendously difficult it is to simply maintain a major corporation, much less hit profits and demonstrate growth every quarter. Yishan may not ever have a C-level position again, but he'll also never have trouble finding work as a consultant or adviser. For a guy of Yishan's caliber, that's a lucrative career, easily six figures a year. If he has no desire to work as an executive again, that would explain why he's being so free with his comments. Reddit is enormous. At this point, it probably has more trolls than 4chan, 8chan, and Voat combined, and Yishan's endured a considerable amount of Internet abuse. Dave Chappelle walked away. Why can't Yishan? No amount of money is worth your health or your sanity. If I remember correctly, he's a husband and a father, which he has very wisely chosen not to talk about on one of the largest websites in the world that's also host to a growing number of unsavory communities. No amount of money is worth endangering your family over, either. I'm assuming that giving up the CEO gig has also given him a lot more time to spend with his loved ones. Seems like a great trade to me. He's got a sharp mind for business and is most certainly a multimillionaire. With some shrewd investments, he can probably continue to live very comfortably for the rest of his life. Folks that are rich and smart always find ways to make more money. BioWare was founded by three medical doctors. Like literally, three guys who graduated med school together decided to start a videogame company on a whim and turned it into one of the most sought after developers in the industry. All three of those guys are retired from the games industry now and doing just fine. Ray Muzyka is an angel investor and Greg Zeschuk runs a web series about craft beer. I'd also like to point out that both Muzyka and Zeschuk retired amidst controversy, when Mass Effect 3 was released to a massive fan backlash regarding the ending. Fans were literally sending Muzyka and Zeschuk death threats for the ending and trying to dox them. You and Yishan are both selling him a little short here. If he wanted to get back in the game, he could. Easily. Not with a huge company like Reddit, but maybe a promising start-up or a hungry journeyman corporation willing to take a risk on a maverick CEO. But from the looks of his posts, he's really tired of dealing with Internet abuse and corporate bullshit, so I doubt he'll resurface as an executive, at least any time soon."

The church shooters little manifesto even enthusiastically praised Asians.  Racist hate ideology has become more nuisanced, which I actually think makes it more dangerous. In the old days it was pretty much just hate for any group that wasn't white. These days it's people who think since they don't despise Asians it means they are just being race realists . They think they're just judging each group for their aggregate behavior. So they can say a bunch of good things about Asians and then relentless hate on black people and in their mind think they're judging behavior instead of just blindly hating on non whites."

SubredditDrama,3dk98f,aznbayb,37,Thu Jul 16 23:25:48 2015 UTC,Or perhaps the DMA/IAB brand safety standards happen to be a great foundation for reducing legitimate damage to a community from hatemongers.  They're the standards for a reason.
SubredditDrama,3dk98f,Existential_Owl,7,Thu Jul 16 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"That's a great point. I work closely with these standards on a daily basis, and it could be because I'm used to seeing this sort of thing at work, but it's just uncanny that these are the exact criteria we ask for web publishers to fulfill before we run ads with them, content-wise (though some advertisers balk at most sites with user generated content).  Hell, the part he mentions about not monetizing porn or hateful content but keeping it under various restrictions is straight out of the Playboy playbook (who recently monetized by moving their porn to another domain). To me, it looks like they're doing everything that some IAB-compliant ad exchange has specifically asked of them, and probably that talks have already been had with their brand safety teams. (My money's on Google AdSense or AOL's ONE platform, but there are other players).   Like I said, this could be bias, but I don't see why he'd mention any of this, especially the ""not monetizing on porn/hate"" part if this weren't bs."
SubredditDrama,3dk98f,FranksFamousSunTea,3,Fri Jul 17 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"I think you need to go one layer deeper. Here's a question to start with: why were these standards chosen?  Sure, groups like the IAB have a list of rules they follow, and you have experience following those rules, but what is the reason for them putting together these sorts of standards in the first place?  No one gets up one day to arbitrarily decide on a set of rules. Each restriction has a solid foundation of logic; the purpose of the restriction is to achieve or protect something from being damaged by the act that has been restricted.  So, the answer to my earlier question: people smarter than both of us spent a lot of time researching the effect on a brand of appearing to be linked with distasteful actions. Whether it is porn or hate mongering, they found that the average person will form a negative impression of your brand if it appears connected to such acts. Advertisers request IAB compliance because they know that non-compliance is going to hurt them.  What Huffman is trying to to is promote user growth, but because of the very same reason underpinning the selection of IAB criteria, he needs to avoid the reddit brand itself from being associated with distasteful actions to achieve this. So, given the success of IAB criteria for protecting advertisers' brands, he's likely under the impression that this criteria will get the same success protecting reddit's brand. Huffman and his board are all internet tech guys and IAB criteria is the only real familiarity they'd have on trying to curb brand damage. It's likely the only tool they know of.  Is it a naive move? Probably, since these subreddits leak into the publicly visible parts."
SubredditDrama,3dk98f,OrangeAdventure,6,Fri Jul 17 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well, here's one great point- The top guys with the IAB are incredibly intelligent people and have taken on the tough job of setting an industry standard ad tech. They're asily smarter than both of us, and also totally awesome folks.  What you might have missed, however, is that the QAG 2.0 (soon to be updated with TAG) standards aren't for protecting the publisher's (reddit's, in this case) brand. They're for the demand side- for protecting advertisers who want to put display ads and video on the site.   And it shows. Look at the nature of these standards. If reddit doesn't want to monetize, why did they section off porn, too? Also, why does he say they won't monetize on porn or hate subs if he's not going to monetize on any subs?"

SubredditDrama,3djk1m,Surfacing710,218,Thu Jul 16 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"So reading through the post, is it basically restating what the rules are and not banning anything?"
SubredditDrama,3djk1m,TheEmoSpeeds666,123,Thu Jul 16 20:07:13 2015 UTC,And announcing a slight change to non-pornographic NSFW/NSFL content.
SubredditDrama,3djk1m,TheBoilerAtDoor6,143,Thu Jul 16 20:08:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty big change:    Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.   emphasis mine. Having to log in takes a way a lot of the visibility of this stuff. It also works with respect to the claim that ""if you ban those subs, they will spill all over reddit"", which I don't necessarily agree with, but lots of people seem to think so."
SubredditDrama,3djk1m,sonnyforelli,25,Thu Jul 16 20:37:36 2015 UTC,does this hopefully mean oldschoolcool won't just be hot women from the 60's and 70's in sexy poses anymore?
SubredditDrama,3djk1m,SirT6,38,Thu Jul 16 20:16:00 2015 UTC,It looks like r/rapingwomen (apparently that is a thing) will be banned.

SubredditDrama,3djk1m,gamas,42,Thu Jul 16 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding:   There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:   The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship. A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was somehow so we can better learn the rules. A mod deleted the post because it was spam. No need for anyone to see this at all. A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.    I honestly always thought that Reddit should use the old GameFAQs system of replacing deleted posts with ""[This post has been deleted at the request of the user]"", and ""[This post was deleted by a moderator for violating the TOS]"", so I welcome this suggestion.  (although I don't agree with the idea of the admins overriding what the mods consider acceptable to delete, I think maybe the new mod tools should set up deleted message templates.)"

SRD is always prattling on about how racist it is to say ""I'd never date a black girl"" or ""I don't find ANY black women attractive"", but the fact is nearly no one is making those arguments. People say things like ""I find that I'm less attracted to black women on average"", but SRD still flips its SJW lid. People act like they are handing out fucking medals for pointing out that things are racist.   Average SRD user: ""Durr durr, maybe you should consider why you don't find black women attractive. Society is racist  and has conditioned you to find darker skin, natural black hair, and other physical features associated with PoC as less attractive. It's society maaaan. Nothing exists in a vacuum!!!""   Well, I'm real fucking happy that you just took an introductory sociology course, read two articles on rational wiki, and discovered marijuana. Freshman year sure is fun, don't forget to study though. And you're right, it's just like... society maaaan. Society IS racist. And nothing can exist in a vacuum. That's why it wouldn't be unfair to categorize the interior of the average SRD user's skull as a vacuum, because there sure as hell isn't anything in there.  Don't you dare bring up short guys though. That's different you know. People just have personal preferences completely devoid of any conditioning by society and shouldn't be shamed for them. The ones who should be shamed are those fucking short goobergaters. I'll bet they're lost causers too! I read about it on /r/badhistory. Also, DAE being a virgin is something to be ashamed of and mocking young angry men is totally a progressive thing to do?   And don't get me started on asian men. I don't hate asian males, just asian male culture. Their gender is clearly the most salient part of their identity so it's perfectly alright to dismiss their racial struggles. They're not really PoC anyways. Just a bunch of angry TRP neckbeards. Probably virgins too.   Now pathetic ignorant bigots like IrbyTremor are completely justified in the cartoonish hatred they express for others because they are a proud brave WoC who know the struggles of living in a white supremacist patriarchy. Those guys at /r/hapas though? Bunch of privileged loser proto-Elliot Rodgers with mommy issues. They're all clearly mentally ill. Also it's totes cool and nbd to characterize my ideological opponents as mentally ill.   In fact, using mental illness as an insult is one of the most progressive things you can do. The only thing that is more progressive is conflating any sexual attraction to legal minors with pedophilia. DAE pedophiles with a dictionary? Check out this dank video on how to pronounce ephebophile!!  In closing, Sansa getting raped in GoT is truly the rodney king being beaten moment of our generation. Brogressives have infiltrated the government at every level and passive-aggressive posts on circlebroke may be the only way to stop them. Progressive 20 year-old white male american undergrads are truly the last line of resistance against the encroaching neo-reactionary threat.  TL;DR: Why did the purge end up being such a bust?

I was under the impression it's just hatemongering and brigading/manipulation of comments in defaults).   it's either because they don't care about minority lives (stormfront is linked to several political/racially motivated murders) and they seriously only see offending white women as a problem, or they only care when it doesn't cost them significant amounts of pageviews.  completely despicable. this site is going to be so dead so fast if they don't pull their heads out of their asses and completely ban the ultrarightwing 'chimpire' bullshit so they can actually say they neither affiliate with nor profit from their activities.  I'm not saying antifeminist content is somehow acceptable, but there is a tangible difference between enabling hurt feelings and enabling violence/murder that is absolutely being ignored by the reddit admins if the plan as described goes through."

But the problem is there are a bunch of other issues that laypeople are likely to miss. Like here, he references the bail reform act of 1984, so that's straightforward right?

SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,BolshevikMuppet,4,Fri Jul 17 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple.  The frogist has to be treated as if he's innocent until proven guilty and the burden of proof is high.  Police officers and detectives are often overworked so anything that's difficult to prove (like who put dead frogs on someone's car, motive is not enough) will likely not be pursued.  At this point the frogist is free (even if found guilty the punishment for a first time offender in this sort of situation is often not very harsh) and even more pissed off and radicalized because she took action against him.  I'm not a lawyer but through personal experiences and my profession I'm very familiar with how these things tend to go.  Unfortunately even in fairly cut and dry domestic violence cases not enough is able to be done until it's too late and the process in and of itself is often very traumatic to the victim.  I'd call the police, but I understand why someone might just want to hope it goes away.  I think judging someone negatively on that is often something done when there's not much or any experience with the realities...our detective shows have misled us to a great degree.  Tl;dr: While in an ideal justice system reporting would be a no brainer, we live in the real world and it's a way more complex and painful process than most realize."

Realistically not much can be done.  It would take more resources than are economically feasible to link the frogist to the frogs beyond a reasonable doubt so, while I would report him personally, most likely the only outcome would be it would anger him enough to take more extreme actions and provide a record of prior actions to help prosecute him after he's done those.  It's a bad situation all around, not any really good option."
SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,IAmASolipsist,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer either, so I understand this misconception: reporting something to the police is justified even if it can't get a conviction alone. The police come to the courts (theoretically, under Magna Carter) at the same social level as the defendant.  Let's say the police charge a man with, for example, theft. If they can show up in court and say:   We have 2 people reporting robbery with this man's description during March 2015   That is a much weaker case than,   We have 15 reports of robbery matching this man's description during March 2015   The more evidence the prosecution has (regardless of prosecutor) the more likely a conviction occurs.  TL;DR It's about the bigger picture"
SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,Satafly,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're agreeing with me as that's what I intended to imply about having a legal paper trail.  But at some point the victim has to worry more about her own benefit than the potential use a report could have the future.  Personally I have and would choose to report, but I understand and don't think it's ""wrong"" or speaks poorly of someone who chooses not to.  I also really hope I didn't imply it would be a waste of police time.  I meant to say that the actual police would likely see it as a waste of time because of how little could be accomplished versus resources they'd have to put in it...and I fully realize how screwed up it is that economics play such a major role in our justice system.  There also are just some bad people in the justice system with their own agendas, bigotry and sloth.  Some even are good but end up doing bad things sometimes due to incomplete information or assumptions.  One important thing I've learned from working with police on domestic abuse awareness campaigns is that even if you do choose not to prosecute it is fairly safe and generally not a problem to ask to file a report without action.  Most commonly this would occur if police are called and the victim decides not to prosecute (for whatever reason, these things are emotionally complex) they can ask for the instance and statements to be recorded and those can help a lot later.  However, again, doing so might be a good idea but I can't really blame someone for being too afraid to do so...there's no simple or great answer."
SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,IAmASolipsist,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:10 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen from working with police departments and personal experience it's much more likely to end in her death if she reports as it will anger him more and it's unlikely much, if anything, would be/could be done.

Stalking and abuse of this sort is often not punished harshly for first time offenders (though this can vary by jurisdiction, even going to jail for more than a month generally only happens in extreme and clear cut cases).  This is not to mention actually linking the frog murderer to the murderer and placement of the frogs may be difficult.  This is sad, but the PD only have so much funding and generally don't do intense investigations unless the crime is considered important for public relations or severe enough.  If I were this woman I would pursue it regardless, however it's unlikely the guy would be punished and now this psychopath is way more pissed off for her ""ratting"" on him and is more likely to act even more extremely and violently.  Even with reporting of stalking or domestic violence it's common that nothing really useful is done until something majorly bad happened.  My desire for justice makes me wish she would do something but knowing what happened to me and people I know and have interviewed I can't blame a person for just wanting it to stop in hopes their life isn't further ruined.  And though I'm not in law I have a lot of experience with this area due to personal experiences and doing a lot of PSA work for various police departments about this stuff.  I don't know all PD dynamics in all areas (it varies a lot) I have talked with a lot of police officers in both large and small cities and even the ones I've not been a huge fan of have mentioned these issues.  Regardless, this is an insanely complex issue so the guy criticizing the woman for not taking legal action is a giant asshole as he can't relate and he obviously doesn't know how difficult legal action can be in a ""getting anything good done"" and ""revictimization"" sense.  Tl;dr: The alleged lawyer has many good points but does act childishly throughout, the other guy is an asshole for judging someone in a situation he can't relate to and with knowledge mostly gained from watching Law and Order: SVU reruns."

I wish I could post there, but in general and in any situation where you feel your physical safety may be in danger in a way you can't avoid a good self defense measure that most don't think about is a small fog horn.  The loud noise often startles the aggressor long enough for you to run, generally notifies everyone around to look, and generally makes the aggressor think it's more likely other people will look and they'll be caught.  Obviously a cellphone or some way to quickly contact help is important as well.  Of course all situations are different and the ability for people to hand any given situation varies drastically by person so this is just a suggestion I've heard recommended by domestic abuse detectives and victim advocates.

Unfortunately entertainment via human suffering is something that's existed for a hell of a lot longer than the internet.  It's a complex issue and the causes vary per person, but I definitely think anger and dissatisfaction at oneself or circumstance can lead to a desire to see suffering in others as a sort of really screwed up catharsis and also a desire for others to be forced to identify and understand one's own pain.

SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,Kyldus,7,Fri Jul 17 04:26:26 2015 UTC,How dare those hypothetical women laugh. We must approximate their hypothetical wrongs
SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,PootiePoots,-22,Fri Jul 17 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"Scroll down for Tl;Dr, but I really suggest you (/u/reallycreative) read the whole thing.  I have a few problems with what you are doing, namely, being uncharitable, and (this problem stems from the first) creating a strawman out of what you actually agree with. So I'm going to do two things in order to show why I have these problems, the first is to explain what the principle of charity is, and why one ought to follow it, and secondly what a modus tollens is, and why you are strawmanning his.  So, what's this about being charitable?  In any philosophy 101 class, one of the very first things you learn (along with the five famous forms, one of which we will deal with later) is the principle of charity. The principle of charity, simply put, is taking an argument and interpreting it in the best possible light.   For example, I would assume you have a problem with people on Reddit painting all feminists as people who want the 1920's back, only with gender reversal (i.e. women being in power, men getting no input, all that jazz). This is a problem. First, because many feminists would not agree that this is their goal, they want equality among the sexes, and going back to the 1920's in anyway hinders that goal. Second, because, even if you are successful in attacking that stance anyway, you haven't made any real progress as the original argument still stands. Think of it as a game of chess. Your goal is to take out the queen, but instead of actually going after the queen, you go after the pawn. This doesn't do you any good, the queen still stands, and the pawn doesn't really matter.  So, if you want to attack any argument, be charitable. Get it to a point where the person presenting the argument can agree, and the argument is good enough to where the person agrees ""yes, this is my argument."" Otherwise, you're not doing any good by your misrepresentation, as the actual argument still stands, and you've just wasted your time by attacking a false argument.  Onto the second point.  His argument has two statements:  S1. I think as men, we need to laugh as hard and as loud as the women when John Bobbit got his dick cut off.   S2. Personally, I think both situations are NOT funny.  And what I believe his conclusion to be, contained in S2:  S3. Both situations are not funny  Now, let's use what we just learned to these statements, which from now on I will use the term ""premises,"" to indicate that they support the conclusion. Now we can interpret what the premises are, and we can do it charitably.  I believe the first premise should look something like this:  C1. If women ought to laugh at men's suffering, men ought to laugh at women's suffering.  And the second, the one you dismiss as him not believing, as this:  C2. Men ought not to laugh at women's suffering.  Notice here, I did not directly translate it directly. This is because I want to be charitable to his argument. In his untranslated premise, S2, I believe that is where we find the conclusion. You see, neither situation is funny to him, he blatantly says that. And S1 says that men need to laugh as loud as women, not that men need to simply laugh, but that their laughter is also contingent on the laughter of women. But here he is saying, neither situation is funny, that is, in neither situation should anyone laugh. Which is where I get the conclusion:  C3A.  We ought not to laugh at the suffering of either sex.  However, for the purpose of keeping the argument simple, I will further translate it as:  C3B. Women ought not to laugh at at men's suffering.  Notice, if you look at the five famous forms, that C1, C2, C3B, is a case of modus tollens. That is, C1 presents a conditional statement (if a, then b, or, A->B), C2 presents a negation of the consequent (Not b, or, ~B), which leads us to the conclusion of C3B (Not A, or, ~A). Which is a valid form.  Now, your job is, after being charitable, is to deny one of the premises, either C1 or C2, if you want. Now I notice you actually agree with this argument, so I will not go into detail on how to do that.  (As a side, I don't believe C1-C3B is properly translated. For example, if I really wanted to take time on this argument, I would include conjunctions, and use predicate logic, (which is a little much to explain), and have more than two premises. But the example argument is still sufficient to explain my problems, although I would be happy to really translate the argument if anyone believes I did a poor job.)  Either way, I feel you leave out a statement that is paramount in the argument, namely, C2, not because you didn't see it (your original comment shows that you did), rather you leave it out because you either needed something to circle jerk against, or you felt you couldn't argue against him, in which case you created a straw men.  This is not anything I have against you, I just see this as a problem all throughout SRD, an SRS, one of which I happen to enjoy, if it wasn't for sightings of uncharitableness, which really get to me. This isn't so much a gender or ideology thing for me, but from a logic standpoint I can't stand when people do something like this.  Tl;Dr, You leave out a critical premise in his argument, translate incorrectly, when you actually agree with him. And, if you don't, you should be charitable to him."

The quoted OP is gendering the situation and baiting arguments. You don't have to take philosophy courses to read between the lines and see someone's intentions in their writing. A literature or writing course will teach you about subtext. Riddle me this, why is anything the quoted OP said relevant to the topic of a woman getting acid attacked?

SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,SRDmodsBlow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure: I've had a rant built up for a while. I chose a bad argument to use it on. The Bobbit example sucks, the comparison sucks, it's just an all around bad argument.  But I do feel that if we are charitable, which we should be, there is a point to be made. Which is what I'm getting at, being charitable is more classy, it makes for a better counter argument too.  Oh, what do I care. I've been downvoted, no one will listen, give this comment all the downvotes you want. I tried to be nice, I really did, but in the end, biases will be biases, you really can't win by trying to be more moderate. Whatever."
SubredditDrama,3dk9ir,AusOffroader,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"I agree--it's good to be charitable! Discounting one part of an argument because another part is fundamentally flawed is not always accurate or fair.    I've been downvoted, no one will listen, give this comment all the downvotes you want. I tried to be nice, I really did, but in the end, biases will be biases, you really can't win by trying to be more moderate.    I think your problem here is that you chose to hang a perfectly good hat (i.e. ""let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater"" if I may paraphrase) on a truly sorry peg. And when you align yourself with an illogical argument, people are going to tear it to pieces. Had you clarified your stance on the argument instead of defending it, perhaps things would have been more successful. But I don't think the message you should take away should be ""you can't win by trying to be moderate"" because you're not coming off as moderate (at least not in all of your other comments about this). When you rant, you gotta pick something your rant is relevant to, otherwise you're going to get slammed--don't turn this into a ""people just don't get me!"" situation."

Hell no.  And certainly nothing would get him held without bail pending trial, since most states (I want to say all, but I'm not 100% sure about some of the crazier ones) have bail as a matter of right absent very specific extenuating circumstances.  Incidentally, the bail reform act of 1984 isn't at all applicable here. None of the crimes it'd be possible to charge this guy with fall under federal jurisdiction.

SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,Frostav,22,Fri Jul 17 23:38:25 2015 UTC,"Also, well-done steak is the best   Man, I know the rarejerk is strong on Reddit but I recently had some well-made rare and medium-rare steak and...damn. Like, I can seriously understand what they mean they rarejerk. That shit is good"
SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,prpldrank,6,Fri Jul 17 06:41:05 2015 UTC,"Works with burgers too. Get yourself some ground beef from a place that is very clean and freshly grinds their beef. Bring it home and immediately form it into patties.   Get your grill going and salt and pepper the first Patty and immediately pop it on the grill. Wait about three/four minutes and salt and pepper the second Patty and immediately pop that one on.   Turn the first Patty first and after about 90 seconds, the second.   Onfe the first Patty is firm under a finger, pull both patties. Build your burgers identically side by side, cut them in half, and dig in. You should have a mid rare burger and a mid well burger. Decide which you like better. It won't even be close."
SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,Infin1ty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"It won't even be close   You're right, the medium-well will definitely be better. I love a medium rare steak, but for me a burger should never be cooked anything other than medium-well to well done. You don't see the best burger joints putting out anything that has pink, and that's because it doesn't taste nearly as good."
SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,prpldrank,3,Fri Jul 17 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"Not true.    It is usually not possible for restaurants to make a safe burger unless its medium or further. This is because the act of grinding usually ""laces"" the beef with bacteria. If you grind at a sanitary station and immediately form and cook the patty it's fine though. Hence my phrasing to op.    Medium rare burgers are far superior in flavor to medium or mid well. But it's just not sustainable for most places to serve them safely."
SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,Homomojojojo,4,Fri Jul 17 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"There are often laws that prevent them from serving burgers with pink, and restaurants have to concern themselves with contamination. All the best burger joints in Chicago go medium by default.  A well done burger is just as dry and tasteless as a well done steak.  Before I moved to Chicago which has some of the best food in the country, I was like you, and didn't even know that s burger could be cooked anything but well done.   Take this for instance:  http://m.yelp.com/biz_photos/kumas-corner-chicago?menu-item=kuma-burger&select=gdPQKiMi4yyyY0LDuWc7kg&skip_bridge=true  And this:  http://m.yelp.com/biz_photos/au-cheval-chicago?select=2CMZwGBWpIyMU9660P16jQ  Kuma's and Au Cheval consistently show up as being not only some of the best burgers in Chicago but also the entire US."

SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,snookums,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"As well they shouldn't. Ground beef is mixed from more than one cow, magnifying the risk of infection if the meat isn't thoroughly cooked. The lowest any restaurant should cook a burger is medium well. If you want a rare or medium rare burger, you need to make sure it's ground from only one animal on a clean grinder. That'll minimize the risk of infection."

SubredditDrama,3dl6i2,firestar1215,6,Fri Jul 17 09:58:31 2015 UTC,"well, I'll explain my dislike for it. I actually find the pizza to taste okay, but the thing is I live in a college town so there are pizza places all over the place, not to mention a local place that has some of the best pizza around. So I have to judge a place by price, taste, and how much. So for dominos, which I find only okay, and not terribly filling, I don't even put it on my list of pizza places. Most of the time I do either, pizza hut, the local place, or Pie five. Pizza hut because I can get two medium pizzas that taste good for only about 20ish, the local place because while it's a little more on the expensive side, their stuff is really filling and tastes amazing. Pie five is good when you are out and want pizza because it's really filling and super cheap.   Yes I take my pizza very seriously >.>"

I'm not saying you have to sympathize, it just goes a lot deeper than ""report them"" because most blue collar workers are more concerned with paying rent and feeding their kids than being ripped off a little at work. it's really depressing, though, and I've heard some sad stories from coworkers when they worked in other restaurants."

Tipping 15-20% of the bill before tax (""some would say 15-30% now,"" says Lynn) is the average range for waitstaff, skewing higher for great service. Leaving 10% reflects substandard service, zero abominable.   this is pretty consistent with what i've heard from friends in the service industry, and i don't even live in a metropolitan area.  i still don't understand why thinking an 18% tip is not outstanding is ""entitlement"" in some way, maybe every average tipper just wants to feel like they're a really good tipper?  obviously none of this applies to people who aren't in the united states."

SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,Xaguta,0,Fri Jul 17 14:31:11 2015 UTC,Then what was the point of you saying no server deserves 30%? It seems to me that's what he was implying by saying 30% was outstanding.
SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,potato1,3,Fri Jul 17 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Ugh.   Because 30% is an insane amount to tip, because it means that out of the money you're spending on your restaurant experience, 23% you pay to the server, while the other 77% you pay is divided up to pay everything else in the restaurant. That includes all the wages of cooks cooking your meal in the back, bussers, host, cost of ingredients, rent, licenses and taxes paid by that business.   All while the server doesn't have any business costs, and unless they're working at a truly high-end restaurant, no particular need for a skillset. While doing a fairly comfortable job."
SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,Xaguta,0,Fri Jul 17 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly what he was implying by saying that 30 was outstanding, as in far more than he would reasonably expect."
SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,foppishfox,3,Fri Jul 17 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"My ""What the fuck"" was aimed at the people who tipped 30%. Not his claim that he'd consider a 30% tip outstanding. Although he does imply of course that anything under 30% is not outstanding, which it is fair to disagree on."
SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,Xaguta,0,Fri Jul 17 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"Clearly you've never served. Servers spend entire shifts on their feet with no mandatory breaks (due to loopholes in the labor laws), get paid 2.13 an hour, which they hardly even see (I've had $0.10 paychecks), and get screamed at and looked down upon by entitled jackasses day in and day out. And since when did I say I ""deserved"" 30%? I said it was outstanding, as in unusual, out of the ordinary, generous, etc."
SubredditDrama,3dkvmp,ttumblrbots,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"You didn't say that. I think the people who tip 30% for your job performance are being stupid. If a 20% tip is average to you you can deal with a couple of assholes a day.   A lot of people need to deal with assholes on a daily basis for a lot less money than you're making. You know goddamn well you're clearing a lot more than minimum wage because of tips. There are a lot of hard workers in this world, and you're one of the lucky ones.   Do you provide value to the restaurant? Absolutely. Is that value worth 23% of gross restaurant revenue? Absolutely not.  If a server isn't earning what his service is worth he should work in a more expensive restaurant."

One day I'm going to get all of my thoughts down about that, but I think the simplest way of putting it is that Reddit (and in many ways, everywhere) is in a state where there is a constant arms race over who can be the most hyperbolic, the most passionate or the most verbose. It's ridiculous and frustrating, but at the same time, it's basically a popcorn machine for us, here.  In the end I think it's more likely people who say shit like that are just trying to hard to be accepted in a shitty environment than actually damaged, but then again, too much exposure to the environment they are trying to please could probably lead to some kind of damage, and that train of thought leads me to the giant wall of text I hope to someday write on this bullshit."

I know a couple of girls who were raped and both of them said they didn't care and that it's not something they think or dwell about. Verbatim, ""It's not that big of a deal.""  Take that with a grain of salt, because I only know what they said.   That's not to say rape isn't mentally traumatizing 99 percent of the time.  Just in some cases, people might actually think that cheating is worse and would affect them worse."

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,CantaloupeCamper,19,Fri Jul 17 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"That initial comment is such an interesting thought exercise.   A girl at work was dating a guy and tried to break up with him after about a month or two. The guy literally cried for her not to leave and she relented. She didn't respect him after that though. Later she cheated on him with a random person a few weeks later and eventually broke up with him, while probably correctly not disclosing that she cheated. He also apparently told her almost every one of his girlfriend had cheated on him.   A month or two later, she started dating someone new and it was going well and she asked me how can you tell if a guy will be faithful, which was kind of out of nowhere question. She was dishonest in her relationship and now feared people would be dishonest back and became paranoid. I think that's just how some people react to becoming cheaters. I can't say I have too much sympathy."

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,gasolinerainbow,5,Fri Jul 17 02:22:07 2015 UTC,Definitely.  I've been in two relationships that didn't end because the other party threatened to hurt themselves. They both ended with me calling an ambulance.

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,SevenLight,-32,Thu Jul 16 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"A few years ago my SO of five years (both in late 20's) started seeing someone behind my back.  When it came to light and we broke up, it was the most emotionally catastrophic thing I had ever experienced.  I gave very serious thought to committing suicide because of how betrayed, hopeless, and worthless I felt.  It took me a year and a half to get to a baseline level of stabilization, and now, three years later, I'm still haunted by it almost every day and frequently lose sleep over it.  I remain convinced I will never be able to get into a close relationship ever again.  So, if I had to choose between that and getting the shit kicked out of me and violently raped (by a stranger), I would choose the rape in a heartbeat.  I'm not trying to minimize rape, but I can understand this guys argument from personal experience.  Honestly, I think I'd rather be murdered than go through those years of emotional torment again."

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,treebog,4,Fri Jul 17 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"I have plenty of perspective on it, and I believe I am quite empathetic in general.  Nor was it my first relationship.  I don't want to go into details, but there were children involved (hers, not mine), it lasted five years, everyone seemed content until the end, and it ended at the drop of a hat.  It was not dissimilar from losing a family in an instant whom I was never going to be able to see or essentially talk to every again.  They became dead to me, not by my wishes, overnight.  I figure you're empathetic enough to understand how this could lead to some serious mental trauma that even a big daddy-pants grown up could suffer from.  Again, I am sorry for comparing it to rape and I'm sure there are people who would be more traumatized by rape than ending a long-term relationship.  Having had three years to reflect on the emotional trauma I've been though, however, I still feel like I'd easily prefer some other horrible trauma than go through that again."

They're just people with no more insight into my life and mind than any other person, and substantially less than my own.  The only things that help are time, alcohol, and narcotics.  Not all the time, just when my mind is overwhelmed, which is increasingly less frequent."
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,bobjammit,23,Fri Jul 17 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're a troll or not, but I'm not in the habit of dismissing mental health issues just because it's on the internet, so here goes: as somebody who's experienced both rape and cheating by several long-term partners, cheating is waaaaaaay easier to get over, because you're more likely to have a support system you're already familiar with. If normalcy were Earth and cheating were, Mars, then rape is a whole other galaxy.  And therapy isn't just you being a passive patient led toward mental health by a professional. Good therapy is a patient and a professional working together to figure out how to integrate you into a functional life that you're satisfied with. And I know this part is going to be hard to hear, but really, really big part of a functional and healthy lifestyle is not abusing alcohol and opiates. Your coping habits aren't just unhealthy, they could kill you.   Remember what I said about having a support system you're already familiar with? I was referring to your friends and family. They don't have to play the part of your therapist; they can and should already be a part of your life, and just spending time with people who love you can be hugely helpful toward developing healthy thinking patterns and coping skills. Please, please don't resort to abusing substances to calm down!"
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,nothingtoworryabout,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not really interested in discussing this much further, but I'll address your main points.  All the support systems, therapy, friends, and family, were totally incapable of changing my thought patters so that I didn't have constant intrusive thoughts throughout the day and especially when trying to sleep reminding me of the life I had unexpectedly lost.  Everything else they told me or could possibly tell me was useless if that could not be stopped.  I speculate that this is why a lot of vets kill themselves despite having support groups and being in therapy.  You have to be able to stop the intrusive thoughts/memories.  Not to compare myself to combat vets... digging my hole deeper :|  As for drugs, all of the ones I used were prescription, and as such had limited to zero abuse potential.  I didn't buy anything on the street, except pot.  No opiates.  Just benzos.  Benedryl too, actually.  Alcohol was indeed abused on and off at times.  I would use these if I knew that I was going to be unable to sleep at night because my brain just wouldn't stop reflecting on five years of history that had been lost.  I tried it without... inevitably I'd be up all night, thinking a variety of self-destructive things.  So most of the time I'd bite two liquid benedryl caps (100mg) to fall asleep quickly, but still feel like shit the next day.  If I had benzo to spare, that was a huge help in making me feel normal and happy and also worked as a sleep aid.  Alcohol pretty frequently for the same purpose.  As I said, not so much anymore.  Obviously other people can handle it differently and be less impacted than me, and for other people it would be less of a big deal than being raped.  I was really meaning to make my whole commentary be 'from my perspective... blah blah blah' but I understand everyone who feels like shitting on me for saying so."
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,Afrodisiac333,-17,Fri Jul 17 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"I was referring to your friends and family.    You have to be joking, right?

I'm not even sure how you can claim that friends or family will help, are you upper class or female or something?"
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,nothingtoworryabout,18,Fri Jul 17 05:47:35 2015 UTC,What does being upper class or a woman have to do with anything? A support system is important regardless of a person's background.

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,bobjammit,3,Fri Jul 17 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"This discussion is essentially oppression olympics between rape and cheating.  I chose my olympic victor based on the fact that it involves a betrayal of years of close emotional attachment and trust as well as potential loss of family, while the other does not involve those aspects, as I stipulated with my 'by a stranger' remark.  If other elements were to be brought in, such as being raped by a family member or SO, I would reevaluate my perspective considerably.  I can only assure you that I have all the empathy in the world for rape victims and believe it to be one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed.  However, I am stating from my own experience that the long term trauma from cheating is extremely substantial due to the many personal linkages it has with the rest of your life, whereas rape is somewhat more of an isolated event, with my stranger caveat.  That being said, people have different coping mechanisms than I do, and some people would be able to adapt better to being betrayed by their partner of many years than they would to being sexually assaulted.  I probably should have just written a wall of text in my first post to include all the caveats and avoid having to respond to everything."
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,Georgia-OQueefe,11,Fri Jul 17 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"not trying to minimize rape   You just did that though. As someone who was raped by a boyfriend after an arguement, it's ruined a large part of my life. It's made me incredibly fearful and on guard around people I'm attracted to, to the point where it's hard for me to form long lasting romantic relationships and even harder for them not to fracture. If I sense someone becoming interested in me faster than I'm ready for, then I grow distant as I don't know how to tell if that person is merely interested or if they'll turn into the controlling abusive person my ex was. I know you clarified that you think things would be better if it was a stranger rape but as a survivor of a rape by an intimate partner I don't see myself dealing with a rape by a stranger all that much better. I'll take someone cheating on me rather than the hell being raped continues to put me through 4 years later any day."

I also after re-reading your post realize I didn't address the part where you talked about feeling suicidal and I want to apologize for referring to what you went through as merely getting cheated on, when it clearly hit you very hard and created some rather deep emotions. I don't take suicide lightly either and I don't think that those feelings are easy to deal with as well and I apologize for minimizing that."
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,ryan_goslings_smile,3,Fri Jul 17 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"No. The ""stranger"" part not important because then you are just afraid of strangers and being by yourself at parties, concerts, bars, festivals, etc. you are paranoid and hyperaware for a good time afterwards, you are scared of engaging with people the gender of your attacker. You may even become sucidal and will have panic attacks and flashbacks for years and years to come. But please continue trying to justify your self-centered statement. It's not ""oppression olympics"" and that language continues to minimize trauma of rape victims."

To me this sounds less horrible than what I went though.  It's largely, although not wholly, externalized; it doesn't draw entirely on years of personal experiences you went through with someone you loved and were building a life with.  As for the suicidal thoughts/panic attacks/flashbacks, those are all things I experienced for years and still occasionally do.  It basically is a form oppression olympics because the argument is 'my horrible suffering is worse than your horrible suffering'."

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,TotesMessenger,15,Fri Jul 17 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Rape is worse than being cheated on for either gender. But it's obviously immature men/boys here who think that rape is no big deal that are commenting about their ""abusive"" ex's.  If I had to guess, rape was considered less painful to you as an adult because of what happened to you as a child. Which shows just how insanely damaging rape can be to someone's self esteem. That having your body victimized is worse than having someone leave you in a relationship is really a horrible thought to have. It means that your self-worth is in the gutter and from what you posted, it sounds like it partially got that way from what happened to you as a child."

I'm hardly able to write this out without having my heart beat uncomfortably fast and the shivers shooting down my spine. I'm in therapy for it. For me the rape didn't give me lasting pain.

That's pretty bad. Did they fuck up, fall to sexual attraction and immediately regret and confess? That's not as bad, IMO.

SubredditDrama,3dk21z,SaintBecket,-71,Fri Jul 17 03:23:56 2015 UTC,In most circumstances I'd rather be raped than be cheated on so long as it wasn't a violent rape and I didn't get any STD's etc. Obviously most people are different though.

I feel like if you're going to try and have a discussion about whether or not you'd rather be raped or cheated on, specifying what quality of rape you'd be okay with doesn't make much sense.       You don't get to pick how rape goes down. It's not like you can talk to a rapist and be like ""Hey bro, we'll be cool as long as you don't have STD's and put that knife away."" The whole thing about rape is that you have no control.     I'm probably just being pedantic, but I thought that was just straight up weird."

I don't think it's good for discussion/state of the sub if we tell people to just not share their honest, respectful thoughts/feelings on a topic just because we don't agree with it.  I'm inclined to kinda agree that it's not entirely accurate to say to say that for all people, rape is always worse than cheating. My girlfriend is deathly afraid of becoming pregnant to the point where someone asked her seriously if she'd rather get pregnant or would she rather die. She had to stop and actually think about it. That's something that should be a no brainer but to her, because of her emotional baggage, pregnancy would be a fate worse than death. I can see some people have some emotional baggage that makes being betrayed by the ones closes to you worse than a stranger abusing you, I don't think it's SUCH an outrageous comment, worthy of 87 net downvotes on two comments."

I don't really mind an unfaithful partner, although I'd prefer it if ithey told me before having sex with someone else. I'm very open minded :)   Rape, on the other hand, I never want to experience that. But for someone who thinks being cheated on is the worst thing ever, that's how I'd describe rape to them."
SubredditDrama,3dk21z,FlavsT,4,Fri Jul 17 10:12:25 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! You described it so well I assumed that you were a survivor. But yeah - one of the things that caused me the most problems after being raped was this feeling that my body had betrayed me (in that it attracted the rapist, in how it responded to being raped, in not being strong enough to fight him off, etc). Very similar to the feeling of betrayal that comes with being cheated on. You can leave an unfaithful partner, though, hate them and be angry without hurting yourself, and eventually leave them behind and move on. Rape victims are stuck in their body for the rest of their life, however, and they have to figure out a way to forgive their body and care for it and treat it well, when all they want to do is punish it. I think if you told people like the OP above, who had such a rough time with being cheated on, that they had to go back and live with their unfaithful spouse in tight quarters for the rest of their lives...I think they might start to realise why a lot of rape survivors end up killing themselves or harbouring addictions. :/  Btw, good on you for having a good attitude toward open relationships. :)"

I'm on mobile so I don't have sources, but I recall there being no documented cases of cis people exploiting bathroom laws to get into the other bathroom. Unlike what many people seem to think, bathrooms aren't a particularly good place for sexual assault, because they're still relatively public. Not is it a good place to see naked people, because you rarely see naked people in the bathroom. Even in a locker room, most people would feel too ashamed, and realize that porn is a better way to see people naked."

I.E. Bill Cosby the prolific date rapist. Could have had any number of affairs without forcing people, but decided to resort to weird shit anyway.   I think some people get off on being convoluted, and I don't doubt that someone, somewhere, is going to ""use"" this as a way to rape people, because this narrative is so deeply ingrained in the public psyche.

SubredditDrama,3diu50,genderish,10,Thu Jul 16 21:13:55 2015 UTC,what toilets do they expect trans people to use anyway? Are they not allowed to go at all? Do they think they don't pee or poop any more after hormones and/or surgery?
SubredditDrama,3diu50,llkkjjhhggffddssaa,-35,Fri Jul 17 06:13:47 2015 UTC,Do you not see how some people may find it a little weird though? At what point of the transition do they start using the other bathroom? It's something I've never really thought about but I'd love to be informed. I don't think it's that farfetched to say some people may be uncomfortable with it but that's not to say they should be.
SubredditDrama,3diu50,Lilusa,55,Thu Jul 16 18:32:58 2015 UTC,I think I pass decently but even still I am terrified of using either bathroom because someone might find me weird or creepy. I end up looking for single stall unisex bathrooms or holding it until I'm somewhere safe.   I'm of the opinion that trans bathroom rights debate resembles the gun debate. Taking away all the law abiding citizens guns means only criminals have guns. So now you have made trans people suffer in the wrong room (literally suffer cause holy shit those assault statistics) and you haven't stopped a single creep from violating women in the women's room.

It's something I've never really thought about until today and really sucks for the people like yourself that have to deal with it. It doesn't really seem to have an easy solution but in my opinion all bathrooms should be unisex.

SubredditDrama,3diu50,boom_shoes,74,Thu Jul 16 18:43:04 2015 UTC,The counterpoint is that a newly transitioning person going to the bathroom of their birth gender is likely even more dangerous/uncomfortable as it basically outs them.

SubredditDrama,3diu50,Chel_of_the_sea,31,Thu Jul 16 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"When you get right down to it, gender segregated bathrooms are ultimately about people feeling more comfortable with it that way. If you accidentally walk into the wrong one, or a group of women takes over the empty men's room because the line for the ladies' is ridiculously long (each has happened in my life once or twice) society doesn't collapse around your ears. If you use a stall, nobody even sees any part of anyone else that's usually covered in public.   Therefore, it's my opinion that trans people should use the public bathroom they feel comfortable in. They're labeled for people's comfort, and trans people are in fact people.   The hypothetical man in a dress who goes into the ladies' room to peep would be very disappointed. We don't actually get naked in there."

After he broke the world record in 1938, it was revealed that he was in fact a man. They actually do tests to confirm the sex of people competing in the olympics which is in itself quite controversial.

They've changed their policy on this several times over the years, and AFAIK they don't do routine gender testing now.  The earlier attempts to do so threw up lots of false positives (often women with asymptomatic intersex conditions), and the consensus now is that trans women don't have an advantage over cis women as long as they have been on HRT for a while.  If they come off HRT, that would presumably show up on standard doping tests.   Anyway, I agree, the basic argument that anyone would go through the trouble of faking your gender just to see a boob is ridiculous. It sounds like the plot of a bad 80's movie.

The armchair psychology and medical degrees from the University of Bigotry have been dusted off in a serious way for this one. I'm an Irish psychology graduate studying to get into clinical training, and here's the actual story:  This law makes it legal for people to choose their own legal gender without medical consultation. Which I, and most people, consider a great move for trans rights. However to undergo hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery, a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (ie being trans) is still necessary. THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY A BAD THING. For a start, it is obviously necessary to make sure the people who want to undergo surgery are actually trans and are of sound mind. Secondly, CALLING IT A DISORDER DOESN'T MEAN CALLING THEM 'CRAZY'. It's just a term for the fact that when someone's body doesn't match their gender identity, something has obviously gone awry and it causes significant distress. Also, it means that treatment is state-funded.  Finally, the approved treatment for this problem is changing the body to match the person's gender identity. The reason for that is that the overwhelming majority of studies show people are much happier after transitioning. Suggesting changing the mind to match the body instead is seen as unsupported, currently impossible and fairly barbaric by most of the psychological/psychiatric community.   And I'm done."

I'm having a neurosurgeon remove my ability to feel empathy for other people. From now on I want you guys to call me ""Redditor"" and respect my right to belittle people who are different to me. If you can't accept me you're a SJW and need to learn how to take a joke. Thank you for being so understanding."

It's something I struggle with because I get such varied answers on the subject from people who think they're experts when in reality it's obviously not fully figured out yet.  However, allowing people to ""choose"" their gender shouldn't really concern anybody else other than the person, so people who don't like that can fuck off and mind their own shit business. I might think some of the trans theories of sex and gender are, sometimes, absolutely absurd, but I don't doubt that people have personal identities that don't match the ""gender"" they were assigned at birth, so this can't possibly be a bad thing."

SubredditDrama,3dgizm,salacio,83,Thu Jul 16 12:06:06 2015 UTC,I think it's more that the admins basically run /r/iama and mods can't do anything about it except housekeeping. The typos just sort of underlined that fact.

They saw, at least in CasualConversation, that she understood the site. Which she didn't seem to show during her tenure.  I got that she probably was caught up with other work, but her clearing the air probably should have been done. Yes, the racism and sexism was definitely uncalled for, and I understand her position, but redditors felt that it was impersonal, and her going to major media before talking to reddit itself seemed like a slap in the face to the mods (this was brought in one of the mod subreddits).  Even during the ""Promote ideas protect people"" thing, they could have worded it better or clarified when people said that ""reddit was being turned into a safe space"", which well, let's be honest, it isn't.  However, after the announcement (and to a point, before that), people turned on Steve fast. It's ironic that I believe it was /u/go1dfish (he's hard-banned) in /r/subredditcancer that forsaw them changing policy and that /u/ekjp was on a glass cliff.  If reddit's management actually showed any competency, this would have never blown out of proportion, AMAgeddon would have never happened, and the outrage from that event would have died off.

It shows a real immaturity to be upset the CEO of the website isn't spending too much time Redditing.   her going to major media before talking to reddit itself   Reddit wasn't having any of her shit. Whatever she would have said, they'd just have shouted at her and called her names. Anyway, I think she was trying to elevate Reddit out of the dark ages.   seemed like a slap in the face to the mods    The majority of users didn't take up arms due to the mods. Instead, it was just a tool to legitamize their hatred and vileness. They were insulting her long before this happened.    If reddit's management actually showed any competency   Reddit's management fumbled in a ridiculously hard place to be in. Again, the hate, vitroil and the dangerous people in here.

When wars start in the real world people come in and sell all the weapons to make that cash money. This is the war economy. Now look at popcorn as money. Now let's just assume that Orville Redenbacher didn't actually die. He was frozen moments before death. The Orville Redenbacher company then set forth to find a cure to his heart attack. But what is the number one thing they need? Money. But in the 21st century popcorn just isn't selling the way it used to during the great popcorn boom (The cold war. The most dramatic of wars.) Now let's look at the facts. Lately Reddit has seen a boom of drama. If you do some simple research you can see a direct correlation in popcorn sales. Just in time for presidential elections. Coincidence? I don't think so.

SubredditDrama,3dgizm,barrybadhoer,2,Thu Jul 16 04:00:11 2015 UTC,He's gonne post a link to voat?
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,justcool393,4,Thu Jul 16 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"Better yet, we could get him on /r/Voat's mod team."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,Obeeeee,7,Thu Jul 16 04:35:10 2015 UTC,It's been boiling over for months; just wait for the shitshow from the purge announcement tomorrow.
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,Marvelina,15,Thu Jul 16 03:12:42 2015 UTC,"We keep saying that because it always has. But this past month it hasn't, instead it just keeps escalating."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,helium_farts,5,Thu Jul 16 03:15:21 2015 UTC,Which is why for the first time in 9 years I think that the doom and gloom crowd might be right.  Reddit has been getting hammered left and right lately and sooner or later someone or something will land a knock out.
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,45,Thu Jul 16 05:17:22 2015 UTC,"And SRD fiddles as it burns. This truly is our finest hour.  I mean, I don't know if this is the end. I've seen plenty of hysterical warnings of things being the death of reddit. But I'm starting to feel like it's not implausible."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,lemonfreedom,37,Thu Jul 16 02:55:38 2015 UTC,I was reading through some of SRD's top posts of all time. It was funny seeing people talk abut Doxxtober or the Karmanaut debacle as potentially being the death of reddit
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,28,Thu Jul 16 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"We had no idea what was coming. No idea. I keep expecting it to end, but they just keep finding new and impressive ways to make it worse for themselves. They haven't even broached the inevitable discussion of how this site ever makes money, and already we're on the brink. God help anyone who was dumb enough to put venture capital into this ship."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,winterd,13,Thu Jul 16 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"They haven't even broached the inevitable discussion of how this site ever makes money, and already we're on the brink.   What if this is like Enron, where everybody thinks it's successful but it's really quite the opposite?"
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,birdsofterrordise,5,Thu Jul 16 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"That's why there is this idea that there will be a tech bubble to burst soon. After apps were being bought for an insane amount of money and everyone is assuming their idea is worth billions, it just isn't sustainable. Though I'd argue reddit is more valuable than other tech pursuits, it probably isn't worth as much as they want it to be."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,junkit33,10,Thu Jul 16 10:28:17 2015 UTC,"Reddit won't end until a viable competitor gets up and running.  Reddit was already humming along nicely when Digg revolted.  Voat isn't even close yet to where Reddit was at that time.  Tomorrow's giant censorship plan unveiling may push the necessary critical mass over to Voat though, so that will be interesting.  If they can get their server situation in order (which I'm highly skeptical of until they build the team with more experienced engineers), they could take the torch from Reddit.  There's also a very real possibility that Reddit just shuts its doors down one day.  If they burn through all of that huge round of funding without figuring out a profitable model, it's pretty much time to declare the experiment over.  At that point somebody will buy the site for a fire sale and make some radical changes that probably won't work, then eventually shut it all down.  The only thing that's pretty certain is Reddit won't last forever."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,_TheRooseIsLoose_,13,Thu Jul 16 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Voat's the worst possible ship to jump to.  It's a stop-gap at best.  It's built on the same style as reddit, so if it ends up getting as successful as reddit it'll have to deal with the same infrastructure problems and will have to try to monetize, which will require the same choices reddit's making now.  Assuming it can get to that point, which is iffy."

SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,7,Thu Jul 16 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, I always expected it would be about money; I never thought for a second this site could make any, and I still don't see how it does. But if they manage to sink this ship before we even get that far...well, that would be glorious, yes."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,The_Rat_Cook,8,Thu Jul 16 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, this site is going down over money, no doubt. But the behavior of the admins makes me feel like some rug is going to be pulled out from under them soon. Or maybe Spez will fix the monitization issue by destroying Reddit's seedy underbelly, and we can go back to the easy days of /r/lgbt drama."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,5,Thu Jul 16 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"Or maybe Spez will fix the monitization issue by destroying Reddit's seedy underbelly   Even if they do that, they've still got a problem that Myspace wasn't able to solve and Twitter still hasn't; they've got no data to sell. Advertising isn't enough; they need additional revenue streams."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,The_Rat_Cook,4,Thu Jul 16 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I don't think Reddit will explode because of that. It'll just fade away. I don't expect Reddit to do something that Twitter hasn't."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,3,Thu Jul 16 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, but I'm holding out hope for the glorious implosion."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,lemonfreedom,3,Thu Jul 16 03:32:47 2015 UTC,There's plenty of data. They just need to figure out a way to monetize it
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,DuckSosu,3,Thu Jul 16 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"Or maybe Spez will fix the monitization issue by destroying Reddit's seedy underbelly   I've seen tons of people saying this, but I wonder how much of reddit's inability to monetize has to do with its ""seedy underbelly"". It seems like a lot of speculation. If by some magic reddit suddenly has a super great reputation overnight would it start making money hand over fist?"
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,doubleheresy,5,Thu Jul 16 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"Reddit's inability to monetize is almost entirely due to the fact that it collects almost zero useful data.  Right from the start, Facebook gets your age, your email, your location, your birthday, and the sort of things you like. This is free fucking money. But here's what personal information snoopsnoo can find about me:  I have a mom and a dad. Wow. Big reveal. I also apparently have a son. Maybe my ex just really doesn't wanna talk to me.  My likes include simplicity, food, and Bloodstone on Storm.   I like to read books.  And I am a champion yurt decorator.  I don't even hide how I live, where I live, or what a shambles my life is, but if that's the kind of data Reddit can offer up, I think advertisers might pass."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,postirony,168,Thu Jul 16 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think what amuses me more than anything is the total lack of organizational courage here. Take the sub, start a competing sub, cave and replace/re-hire Victoria, whatever; just do something decisive. This mealy mouthed, passive-aggressive, plastering reddit's politics all over the place shit can't do anything positive for the site in the long run."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,Kai_Daigoji,103,Thu Jul 16 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"I think what amuses me more than anything is the total lack of organizational courage here   The last few weeks have made it clear that they have no clue what they're doing.  It's like they suddenly realized, after 10 years, hey, we should have a consistent content policy.  It's pure shooting from the hip, and every move they've made is reactive, not a long term policy decision.  As an upside for Victoria, there's a certain schadenfreude in watching your former employer fail miserably after assuming your job was easy/non-essential."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,________FiZZ________,23,Thu Jul 16 03:47:59 2015 UTC,Is there anything suggesting that this whole situation hasn't actually made the site more popular?
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,robotortoise,31,Thu Jul 16 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"Is there anything suggesting that this whole situation hasn't actually made the site more popular?   Hm, I looked at two sources and they both seem to indicate traffic actually DID go down in June/July, or at least didn't increase.  Source 1  Source 2  Maybe the articles about reddit only interested reddit users?"
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,________FiZZ________,21,Thu Jul 16 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"I suppose I meant it like this.  Let's say traffic goes down for the next 4 months costing reddit 10 dollars. If the changes that they made result in them being able to sell ads for 20 dollars more, they end up on top.  A lot of people are claiming that the leadership of the site is incompetent, maybe they should wonder what the goals are instead."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,R_Sholes,4,Thu Jul 16 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Looking at defaults' traffic stats, there's blackout day (and lost data for June 26-28) visible in page views, but otherwise it's going as usual. Daily subscriptions grew by about 5k/day since June, though."
SubredditDrama,3dgizm,pilgrimboy,6,Thu Jul 16 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a downward trend since April. You have the Fattening, AMAgeddeon, along with the frustration in some circles over shadowbanning. Add the Purge to the list, it will go down even more.  But like others have said, they could actually be achieving their goals to make money. So the daily subscription gains may be more than lost out the back door. In the end, they just want to sell, so it doesn't matter unless the perceived value of Reddit in investors' minds plunges."

SubredditDrama,3dgizm,justcool393,23,Thu Jul 16 03:51:58 2015 UTC,"I can see it right now.   Morals, reddit and You  Today, reddit will go forward in our new policy. We are very proud of our AMA team that has been pushing the envelope within regards to celebrity guests.  And this brings us to our new policy. At reddit, we value freedom of expression over everything. This means that controversial subreddits will never be under threat of explusion from this website. But we are also a moral group. Because we value freedom of speech above all, we have to make sure that subreddits that have distasteful content. This is because we are a government, if you will. Of a new type of community. Where people are free to express their ideas and share their content.  So, in effect beginning today, we will be banning subreddits that provide content that do not fall under the controversial banner.  We want to uphold the ideal of free speech, because we want reddit to be a discussion platform, for where all walks of life can express their ideas, no matter how controversial. We do not decide morals, and we at reddit believe that it would be unethical to decide what types of content we should disallow. You are reddit, and you decide what is moral.  As always we want to hear your thoughts and feedback on the new policy regarding content that is harmful to reddit.   Fuck. That actually turned out half-decent, even if I was trying for it to sound bad. I should apply for the Writer job at reddit."

Step 2: Make some argument about what you assume the post is about.  Step 3: Double down when someone points out you didn't read the link/article.  Step 4: Triple down when they point out you aren't addressing what was in the discussion.  Step 5: Click the link.  Step 6: delete all your comments because you suddenly realize how dumb they look.

Who knows what else that could lead to (especially if it came to money or other things being sent to the house).

If she started to get angry, I'd walk away. Then I'd come back a few hours later and try again.  now we have a pretty solid relationship. we don't really do much to make each other angry anymore, or at least anything past mild annoyance.

Kind of.  18 U.S.C 1702 is what he's referring to (mostly), but that has to do with intentional obstruction, there'd be no way to prove that the mother had any specific intent when she opened it.  And that's the ballgame here, there's no way to demonstrate the requisite intent, no requisite intent?  No crime.  1701 is a lesser offense, but also only arguably applies, since she didn't retard the passage of the mail, it was properly conveyed to the address, which then becomes a 100% civil issue if one of the other residents took the property.  To put it another way: the mail was delivered to the appropriate address, anything after that is likely not within the scope of 1701.  I get that there's a certain amount of criminal law people think they know because of the media, but it's really important if we're going to throw around ""it's a federal crime"" to know what the crime is, and what elements must be satisfied to prove it.

SubredditDrama,3dhu85,attackzac21,0,Thu Jul 16 23:05:11 2015 UTC,"You know, that emotional pit you fall into when you lose everything. Or they might be going all in and make a bit of money, and then proceed to lose all of it.  Usually I don't think their starting capital will be significant later on in their lives. But by losing all their money I really hope they'll figure something out. And they might've had a glimse on a lot of money and then squandered it, that's a useful lesson too.  And in reality it's a very cheap lesson, but a very important lesson.  I'm in the bitcoin trading scene and learning proper bankroll management is a very important skill.  I hope you understand what i mean. As long as the subreddit makes sure people understand why it's bad to gamble. As long as you have a serious community , it should be beneficial.  I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.  I'm regarding skill based gambling. I'm not talking about those things where everyone puts money into a pot and they have an equal chance of winning. That's just a lottery. I think that's also something that is the fault of the streamers. I'm not sure if they're sponsored but a lot of streamers openly support those lotteries and Sodapoppin gambles on Blackjack. Seriously I don't think they should be doing that.  But in regards to skill based betting, and also things like arbitrage. These things aren't a big problem. It's a great learning opportunity for kids. And as long as the community isn't promosing making a ton of money then it's fine. As long as they understand the risks.  What do you mean by kids? I think they can be quite smart. There's a lot of lessons in micro and macroeconomics with these virtual ecosystems. And betting is a type of prediction market.  Also where do you think all the money is coming from. I think it's partly attributed to kids spending money on the game."

SubredditDrama,3dhu85,freewheelinCW,7,Thu Jul 16 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"CSGO is an extremely competitive first person shooter that has created a conglomerous betting scene. High profile teams frequently compete in tournaments, and third party sites allow users to bet on their choice of team using virtual, cosmetic skins (some worth $300-$500).  As far as I know, the use of using virtual skins makes this legal (in a grey sense) for minors. Most of the CSGO community however (atleast on /r/globaloffensive) hates betting sites for tarnishing the sportsmanship of the game and attracting hostile, underage people with gambling addictions."
SubredditDrama,3dhu85,freewheelinCW,3,Thu Jul 16 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"I don't play CSGO, but I think the gambling and allowing to trade makes all the whole economy worth more and gives it more liquidity.

SubredditDrama,3dhu85,pnt510,2,Thu Jul 16 22:39:07 2015 UTC,Personally I feel as though people should be able to do what they want with skins. But I can sympathize with people that believe the gambling aspect of it puts too much money into the game.  And we see what happens when sports become to economy focused/commercialized.
SubredditDrama,3dhu85,TOMMPTTTC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:19 2015 UTC,I feel the economy focus becomes half the game. Which is incredibly cool. I don't actually participate in them though.  It's really interesting that there are lot of people who participate solely on the economy side. All the people who decide to arbitrage key/ref prices. Or hat prices.  I think the price is largely due to how many people are willing to quick buy. All those people are injecting money into the game but at a discount. And they're doing it to make a profit. It's all those people who believe it'll still be worth something x amount of time in the future.  I really think that the economy focus is what makes Valve games unique. It really gives them another edge. (You still need a great game for the economy to work). But the economy aspect really helps.

The dude was totally against slavery, but joined the south because of Southern heritage.   Prime candidate for badhistory.  http://www.civilwarhome.com/leepierce.html   I was much pleased the with President's message. His views of the systematic and progressive efforts of certain people at the North to interfere with and change the domestic institutions of the South are truthfully and faithfully expressed. The consequences of their plans and purposes are also clearly set forth. These people must be aware that their object is both unlawful and foreign to them and to their duty, and that this institution, for which they are irresponsible and non-accountable, can only be changed by them through the agency of a civil and servile war. There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil. It is idle to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it is a greater evil to the white than to the colored race. While my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more deeply engaged for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better things. How long their servitude may be necessary is known and ordered by a merciful Providence. Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild and melting influences of Christianity than from the storm and tempest of fiery controversy. This influence, though slow, is sure. The doctrines and miracles of our Saviour have required nearly two thousand years to convert but a small portion of the human race, and even among Christian nations what gross errors still exist! While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is still onward, and give it the aid of our prayers, let us leave the progress as well as the results in the hands of Him who, chooses to work by slow influences, and with whom a thousand years are but as a single day. Although the abolitionist must know this, must know that he has neither the right not the power of operating, except by moral means; that to benefit the slave he must not excite angry feelings in the master; that, although he may not approve the mode by which Providence accomplishes its purpose, the results will be the same; and that the reason he gives for interference in matters he has no concern with, holds good for every kind of interference with our neighbor, -still, I fear he will persevere in his evil course. . . . Is it not strange that the descendants of those Pilgrim Fathers who crossed the Atlantic to preserve their own freedom have always proved the most intolerant of the spiritual liberty of others?   tl;dr: ""Yeah, slavery is bad...but have you considered how bad it is for us white people to have to own slaves? Plus, black people are better off here in America. Also, only Jesus should free the slaves. I just wish those Yankees would realize that they're trampling all over their freedom."""

Your opinion is the same as the white majorities and everyone has heard it thousands of times already.   Can someone explain why this isn't racist, or at least why it's standard and acceptable in places?  Even here in SRD, I see ""typical white dude blah blah blah"" often."
SubredditDrama,3dhv31,Oxus007,139,Thu Jul 16 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'm on a lunch break so I'll try to answer:  I think it depends on what you consider the word ""racist"" to mean. Generally speaking, when people say ""black people can't be racist against white people"" or ""gays can't be straight-phobic"" or ""women can't be sexist towards men"", they aren't saying these things never ever happen, they're saying in general and on a large scale, it isn't happening. ""Racism"" in this term is describing a systematic phenomenon that exists in all areas of life, from beauty, education, job, safety, etc.  So, for example: A black dude goes up to a white person and calls them a cracker and says he hates white people. That guy is definitely being a racist person.  But if we zoom out, is there mass racism against white people happening? Is there history of white people being killed en mass for being white? Is there past and present stories of white neighborhoods or churches being burned down just because they were white? Is there statistical evidence that white people are losing out on jobs based on their names? Is there data that shows white children feel ugly because there is a black beauty standard in our society? Is there statistical data that shows how white characters in shows and in movies are rare and usually token characters? Is there statistical or video evidence that white people are getting stopped unlawfully by police much more thank black people? Is there history behind the word ""cracker"" that shows how it was used to hurt white people, and it's still used in that way today?  Were there large black hate movements that hated white people and killed white people, and do they still exist in high numbers today?   Etc.  So, when a white person says something racist, of course it's going to sting more because they are the majority and there is a past and present history of white people abusing their power and oppressing minorities. When a minority says something racist, it doesn't have the same affect. I mean be honest, do you really feel anything when someone calls you a cracker? I'm not talking about just being offended, I'm talking afraid, or angry, because when it comes to the N word or other slurs, those are words that people have said while they beat up and killed oppressed minorities. They are words that are meant to remind people that they are nothing, that they are beneath the majority.   Think of it another way: If you're an adult and a kid comes up to you and calls you a piece of shit, are you going to get mad and lash out at them? Are you going to be freaked out and afraid for your life? Likely, you won't. You'll either laugh or ignore them, they aren't a threat to you. But let's say it was the other way around: You're a child and a large adult comes up to you and cusses you out. How would your average child react in that scenario? Could they just ignore it? Likely not, they're going to be afraid because the adult is bigger and a threat."
SubredditDrama,3dhv31,BernforBernie,119,Thu Jul 16 16:22:50 2015 UTC,It is just the basic distinction between systematic racism and non-systematic racism. I think the distinction became popular online because people were sick of white people derailing the conversation about something as serious as the mass disenfranchisement of black people to talk about how someone on the street corner called them a honky once. There are a ton of people that like to pretend that everything is equal including racism. It isn't.

SubredditDrama,3dhv31,popcorny27,52,Thu Jul 16 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"The flip side of the coin is that I've also seen it used to dismiss people who had the shit kicked out of them for being white. Which can be annoying and quite hurtful as well. Systemic racism does exist on a different level, I'm not denying that, but it's easy to see why someone might get a little miffed by the idea that their experiences with prejudice and racism don't count.   I think ""White people don't suffer from systemic oppression, or racism on a national or even just local governmental level"" is a lot less likely to rile people up than ""X people can't be racist against white people"", since that second one has the possibility of telling them ""Your experiences with racial prejudice don't count."""

Your opinion is the same as the white majorities and everyone has heard it thousands of times already.   This seems to me like the mod is completely dismissing a person's opinion based solely on their skin color.  The counter argument a lot of the time is something along the lines of: ""well they are being ironic, trying to show you what it's like for the other side"".  That argument falls completely flat to me, as even as a small child I learned two wrongs don't make a right.  Also, I know you are not comparing minorities to children in a literal sense, but:    If you're an adult and a kid comes up to you and calls you a piece of shit, are you going to get mad and lash out at them? Are you going to be freaked out and afraid for your life? Likely, you won't.   The response to this line of thinking is often that white intellectuals are treating minorities like children needing their protection, as opposed to equals needing a partner.  I don't prescribe to that completely, but I think there's a kernel of truth there.  Similar to the whole ""teach men not to rape"" campaign can be argued as treating women as ""lessers"" needing protection."

I can't speak for everyone, but in my experience when people start talking like this it's because it's an argument they have heard a million times and they are tired of it. I know personally that I get really tired of hearing the same arguments from guys who say women who get raped were ""asking for it"" when they decided to wear a short skirt at a party. There have been a few times when I completely stopped talking to guys who have made these arguments with me because I'm human and I don't feel like I have to educate these guys, especially when you give them data or tell them where they can find more information. It gets draining and sometimes people let their emotions get in the way of their judgment and they end up snapping.  Note, that I'm not saying this is the right response to have. I can 100% agree with you that sometimes people who argue like this are in the wrong. I'm just trying to answer 1. why people say that ""black people can't be racist against white people"", and 2. why some people disengage in debates or arguments, especially arguments that are very common or come from people who already have their minds made up and are just trying to start shit.

My example was just to show how being racist is more hurtful when someone from the majority says something VS the minority. That is not saying that minorities are stupid or that white people are better than them; rather, it's showing that there is a massive power difference  when it comes to how racism affects each side, and acting that they are both the same is silly and just not true.  The ""teach men not to rape"" example is also not saying women are weak or ""lesser"", they are in fact saying it is not their fault that they are victims when it comes to rape and that men are the ones that need to be trained not to rape, rather than the common (and ineffective) theory that we should train women to be ""less of a target""."

This is obviously an entirely new discussion, but I speak to this as a martial arts instructor who teaches women's self-defense classes, and also works on a college campus.  There is push back in many places when women's awareness and self-defense classes are implemented, claiming that it is ""blaming the victim"", and that women should not need to learn things that are, in-fact, empowering.  Also,    they are in fact saying women are not the victims when it comes to rape and that men are the ones that need to be trained not to rape   I will reject this line of thinking until the day I die.  ""Men"" do NOT need to be 'trained"" not to rape.  Men AND women are victims of rape, men AND women are perpetrators of rape.   No campaign aimed at teaching men not to rape will ever be effective, because no one who is a violent criminal will think ""you know what, this pamphlet is correct, I shouldn't rape!""  Teaching everyone about what consent means, and empowering everyone (aka martial arts/self-defense classes) will make a difference."

To me the problem is that consent isn't taught very well at all, and this of course has terrible consequences, not only does it lead to rape, it leads to people not understanding they've been raped.  The problem with too many of these campaigns is that they got interpreted as targeting men, which led to a backlash. You got all the ""women can rape"" arguments and ""I know not to rape"" arguments. Many of these problems to me would be solved if consent was taught at a younger age, and less gender focused, because at the end of the day, if someone feels wrongly targeted, they'll become hostile, and won't accept others opinions on the topic, and turn inwards."

For example if two people get drunk and have consensual drunken sex, one, and only one , of them can later regret it and decide it's rape/sexual assault (unless both are male, then either can).  The college hearings are so biased in favor of the accuser, and the effects are so devastating to the accused (essentially being blackballed from academia) that it's easy to see how some people feel men are being targeted."
SubredditDrama,3dhv31,BernforBernie,4,Thu Jul 16 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"Which is why it's important to teach people (not men in particular, but people in general) that rape isn't just having sex with somebody when they've clearly and explicitly said no, but it can also be having sex with somebody who's in no position to consent, like being drunk/high. If you're lucky, you'll get through to a bunch of people who might not have considered that kind of thing rape before, and will be more careful from then on.   Also, ""teach men not to rape"" is a bad thing because most men don't need to be taught this. Most men know that rape is bad, and the ones who don't see it as bad aren't going to be convinced by some poster telling them to get consent first."
SubredditDrama,3dhv31,Oxus007,27,Thu Jul 16 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"There is push back in many places when women's awareness and self-defense classes are implemented, claiming that it is ""blaming the victim"", and that women should not need to learn things that are, in-fact, empowering   I'd like to see that, cause unless someone is advertising self defense as a way to not get raped, I see no reason why people would be against this and haven't heard of any push back against it... in fact, I just read a (Forbes? Can't remember) article that women getting fitter and stronger is trending and expected to grow even bigger (think Crossfit and MMA).   No campaign aimed at teaching men not to rape will ever be effective, because no one who is a violent criminal will think ""you know what, this pamphlet is correct, I shouldn't rape!""   I think you are missing the points of these campaigns. Rape crimes are often from friends and people the victims were close to, not some violent criminal that dragged them behind a dumpster in a dark alley. These campaigns teach about consent, because sadly there are a lot of guys who DON'T know proper consent. I have a large family and I was shocked at some of my brothers and nephew's views on sex were. They aren't bad people at all, but their views on consent were wrong and have the potential to be dangerous. Even on reddit you see a lot of young men who think if a woman says ""no"" but she's still making out with you, then ""obviously"" she wants it and you aren't raping her if you keep going even after she said stop.   Those type of guys do need education because those kinds of rape are very common. While there are definitely violent rapists out there, there are also a lot of guys who are not bad people but unfortunately follow traditional and wrong rules of consent.   If you aren't one of those guys then obviously that campaign is not meant for you."

I'd have to actually see it, cause personally, I haven't heard of any push back for self defense class. They are quite popular at my University, too.

I definitely agree that consent needs to be taught to everyone, and thankfully it sounds like a lot of health classes are teaching everyone about proper consent during sex education these days. However, targeted campaigns are quite common and shouldn't be looked at as saying one demographic is bad while the other isn't, it's just another way to raise awareness for a certain subject. Think about cancer campaigns, just because there is one campaign to raise awareness about breast cancers, it doesn't mean that brain cancer is less important or that you can't have a separate campaign about it."

SubredditDrama,3dhv31,rocktheprovince,14,Thu Jul 16 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"Well sure it works. But if you agree that a culture of sexual coercion exists, the struggle is mainly against the oppressive notion that you can violate someone's bodily autonomy. That needs to be challenged. On an individual and even a collective level people should be more aware of their surroundings, and capable of defending themselves if possible. In all situations, sexual or otherwise. You just can't present that as a solution itself to rape."

Teaching everyone about what consent means, and empowering everyone (aka martial arts/self-defense classes) will make a difference.   I agree and disagree. I've never been a sexual predator, but at a young age a lot of that anti-rape propaganda (I use this term positively) certainly made me re-evaluate what sexual coersion actually is and how it exists all around you well beyond physically raping someone. I think these are more effective in fighting underlying conceptions about sex and autonomy, because like you say, a violent criminal won't care. But normal people can absolutely see these things and learn from them."
SubredditDrama,3dhv31,siempreloco31,13,Thu Jul 16 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yes men and women are victims of rape but at massively different rates, and the rapists of both men and women are most likely to be men. 90% of rapists of men are other men.   In the meantime areas that have run campaigns to teach men not to rape report significant drops in assault rates. It is effective and helpful.  From my own perspective I teach law, and as part of that I've gone around to schools and spoken to kids about consent and so on. In 9 years of doing that I can count the number of senior kids (around 17-18 i.e. old enough to be sentenced as adults) who could correctly explain the legal concept of consent before a class on one hand.  They genuinely don't know what consent is and how it works, and they recieve enormous amounts of pressure socially to have sex, and a whole bunch of mixed messages about what is and isn't ok from the media/porn/society/the internet.   When someone doesn't know or understand what the right thing is you need to teach them. Hoping they just figure it out without raping someone isn't working.   Rape doesn't require intent, you can rape someone and be convicted without intending to do so, which means understanding where the lines are is critical. Do you really think all rapists go out and think 'whelp I'm gonna rape someone today?'. Of course not. The majority of rapes happen between people who know eachother, the creepy guy in the dark alley is a comparably rare scenario. When interviewed most convicted rapists do not acknowledge they are rapists, not because the actually aren't rapists legally, but because they don't understand what rape actually is legally, and their behaviour doesn't fit in with what they understand rape to be (i.e. they weren't a creepy guy in an alley or whatever). In research where people are interviewed and asked if they have participated in various rape scenarios that are described without using the work 'rape' a consistant 15-20% of male participants acknowledge having raped somebody, so it isn't true to paint rapists as some tiny minority of people that you'll never encounter in your day to day life. All of these thing point to education having a significant role in preventing rape. They all point to people not knowing and understanding what rape actually is.   How do you fix that if not via education?"

Maybe they could donate to Voat or another site to get bigger servers, if reddit really is going to fail because people like him leave. If Reddit fails for that reason, sounds like its alternatives could get a lot of users!=advertising revenue!  Or he could start his own FPH/anti-feminist+ website, see if he gets subscribers and go from there?    Or if he stays around Reddit he should not be surprised that more and more users disagree with what he has to say and do some primary research on the topics he complains about? ""Know thine enemy"" kind of thing? I guess once a person has bought into these ideologies that even if they do primary research that he will see what he was taught to see anyway? Maybe when he's 30 or something his fevor will die down and he can read things without turning red and going blind [when people are upset their reading comprehension can go way down so it is a kind of ""blindness""]?"

I'll just do a couple of pointers for some basic questions people ask. For example the problem of evil. The conclusion I got to based on what I was taught is that because God gave us free will, we were free to introduce sin (which is anything contradictory to the nature of God) into the world, and we did. Well, Adam and Eve did. We could say we wouldn't do the same, but then we do, every day. This corrupted the world, like, mold or a disease. God can't be near us because of sin, and really, we pushed him away because well, we want to do our own thing.  Suffering itself is more nebulous because its just so personal. I mean, we all suffer. Generally its considered to be part of this fallen world, because the world isn't perfect anymore, and because others have the ability to hurt us if they want to. I could go on and on about sinful nature too I guess, but that would be a bit of  a rabbit trail.  Some suffering is more along the lines of martyrdom, where we suffer because we love God and the devil wants to destroy that.  And some suffering like illness or natural disaster just seems meaningless, but its not considered to be God causing it, more like he stepped back because after all, we did push him away to begin with. I never believed God caused suffering, either because he has a plan or otherwise, but I believe he doesn't always intervene because this is the world we created for ourselves, in a way. But he loves us so he's still there. I believe all good things come from God, where all bad things are just a result of the fall. I guess maybe that's kind of a glass half full approach? In any case, this was probably terrible, I try not to discuss these things, so I'm not used to spelling out what I think in detail. Sorry about that. As others pointed out, there are some good starting places for research."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,bombadilsboots,27,Mon Jul 20 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"Western Christianity does this a lot. Eastern Orthodoxy goes a little deeper into the state of suffering. The Church is meant to be a ""hospital"" of sorts where people come together as a community to attempt to alleviate both physical and spiritual suffering. Suffering is meant , in some ways, to bring us closer to god. Asceticism is still regarded pretty highly among Orthodox Christians. We fast before major feasts , and still fast twice a week (which means a vegan diet with some fish days). I'm not saying this as truth or anything, but it bugs me when people cop out with ""mysterious ways"" because it effectively ends what could be an interesting discussion."

After Stephen Fry brought it up in an interview that one time the sub was flooded with inarticulate ramblings about it and a lot of the sub has just defaulted to dismissing those discussions, though obviously while still being willing to engage with an earnest poster.

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,_watching,3,Thu Jul 16 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'd question 1.  There is a very anthropocentric account of the natural world in Christian thought.  The millions of nonhuman species serve the teleological function of serving beings with rationality (humans), and have no moral worth themselves.  Wasn't there a theologian who accounted for the existence of gnats as being ennobling to people who must develop the diligence to swat them?  I know there are moral theologians like Charles C. Camosy who challenge this picture, and mention non-human persons (like angels) but the centrality of humans to creation seems pretty fundamental to most Christians.   I'd qualify this section with the statement that I'm pretty ignorant of a lot of Christian history and theology, so please don't think I'm trying to sound authoritative.  With respect to your second point, I think it is at tension with your first point.  If God created all these varying forms of life for human use and abuse, then why would he not have created the natural world (read: known universe) in a similarly anthropocentric way?  I'm not saying that one view inexorably leads to the other, but they seem natural bedmates.  As for the third point you make, I don't see how the distinction between the logical POE and the evidential POE is relevant.  If either succeeds, we have sufficient reason to dismiss the Christian understanding of God."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,FeloniousMonk94,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:50 2015 UTC,"I welcome intelligent argument over this because I'm actually very interested in this question part of why I got annoyed with a comment that I felt explored it badly. I just don't get a chance to talk about it often, so don't worry about sounding argumentative or faux-authoritative. tbh w/ all the shit filling up my inbox atm thanks to the ""purge"" I was happy to see this response.   Wasn't there a theologian who accounted for the existence of gnats as being ennobling to people who must develop the diligence to swat them?   Maybe I stated things weirdly because this is what I'm talking about. Animals, historically, aren't generally seen as objects of moral concern in the same way humans are, AFAIK. It doesn't make sense to ask a guy who thinks gnats are invented to encourage killing them why God would allow for cruelty towards animals, right? I didn't mean to say Christians think animals are completely irrelevant or non-important, just that they're more liable to dismiss the idea that God can't exist because benevolence contradicts cruelty towards animals because they're likely to not weigh human and animal suffering equally.   WRT the second point, I agree there is a tension here, and would have thought CSG's comment pretty good if it explored that tension. My points are just what I see as obvious exploitation of things CSG didn't cover, or possible big holes in their argument. The issue is that my critique has it both ways because their comment tries to - both that the suffering of animals is important, and that humans are the goal. T  Lastly, since my comment is based on ""this is a bad comment"" not anything else, I basically agree and disagree. Sure, if either succeeds, that's great. One has historically not succeeded, but has been repeated ad nauseam on this particular board, so it's worth being specific in order to strengthen your argument and removing one obstacle to communication."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,_watching,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have much to disagree with you about.  I will agree that CSG could have been more open and inviting in his phrasing as well.  (I think you were a bit hard on him though)  Anyway, although I personally think the objection from animal suffering is sound (and I think you do too?), there are forms of human suffering that do not originate from human sin.  Theists must account for all manner of natural atrocities if their theodicy is to succeed.  When I was going through a prolonged depressive episode two years ago, I almost found the idea of an apathetic or malevolent god compelling.  It surprises me the belief in a malevolent god is not more prevalent throughout human civilizations, because of all traits God is said to possess, omnibenevolence seems the hardest to argue for as being necessary to God.  (I think arguing that god is omnipotent and omniscient is relatively easy if that god created everything)"
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,FeloniousMonk94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"On the first bit CSG responded to me. As that comment shows, I am a lot less hard on their position once they explained it.  And yeah, I totally agree that apathetic, malevolent, or ""orange and blue morality"" gods are more compelling for the same reason. Because there is a TON of shit that doesn't make sense when explained by free will or original sin. Like - y'know, the POE that comes up with tornadoes, or asteroids. The closest to satisfied I have ever gotten over that was someone basically saying ""Well, the Christian God doesn't value just being happy. It values overcoming adversity and coming closer together and is trying to facilitate that.""  Which is a totally batshit version of God but one that explains things a bit more fully. Most people don't believe in a God that created a shitty existence on purpose to mess with us, though."

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,carl_sagans_ghost__,5,Thu Jul 16 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"This is my third attempt writing this comment god damn. My computer legit turned itself off midway through the last one. Christ.  Anywho, that was vague so I want to clarify it by doing a line by line.      No.    [insert standard complaints about ""that's a lot of certainty for something you can't prove"" here]   Consider the fact that creatures have been suffering and going extinct for millions of years on this planet. This suffering is unnecessary. If God's ultimate goal was to create humans beings, then he would have just created us from the start.    This is part of the poorly articulated part - I wasn't originally aware that this wasn't two points. I thought it was ""problem of evil"" and then ""also it'd be more efficient to make us first"" - scanning the comments I can see others are confused in the same way. This is because they didn't flesh out their point.  But let's tackle the point - basically it's ""Evolutionary history is full of horrific suffering. Wouldn't a benevolent God just create us first if that's his goal to avoid all that?""   It's very weird to assume God's primary goal is to make humans, considering he also put a whole lot of effort into making vast, unoccupied sections of space/whole other planets, as well as termites and creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean. God's ultimate plan and motivations are a mystery to Christians, and assuming that the end goal is us is a bad place to start. Why does this assume God gives a shit about the suffering of animals? As a vegetarian I don't love these bits of Christianity, but God pretty explicitly calls for animal sacrifice in parts of the Bible, encourages humans to eat animals, tells humans that they have dominion over other animals - I mean, Christians aren't all settled on the question of if animals have souls, even. This is why the usual track is to argue that shitty things happen to human beings, and therefore God is bad. So that makes it a more faulty argument - a lot of Christians could just counter with ""who cares about dinosaur-on-dinosaur cruelty"". The argument overall is poorly articulated in that it immediately falls into the common pitfall of problem of evil arguments. Basically, there are two problems of evil that are levied against Christian God - humans are dicks to each other, and the planet is a dick to us. The former is easily handwaved with ""free will"". The latter is actually really difficult to answer. The argument would be less of the standard ""atheist comes into /r/Christianity, posts very basic form of problem of evil, acts smug"" if they had been more specific and obviously aware of former discussion on this topic in the sub.    Instead what we see when we look at the history of the planet is exactly what we should expect if there is no God; suffering, death, extinction, over unfathomable periods of time.   As well as beauty, unfathomable complexity, and everything that creates the awe that we feel when we comprehend the universe - which is a big part of a Christian's faith. This is a pretty unsophisticated view of history in general. But yeah, again, the immediate response is ""why wouldn't we expect that under a God?""  Overall, the tone of the comment is pretty blunt and total. There's no concessions that this is an active discussion, or nuances to be explored. It's presented as an open and shut case. This is a pretty good sign of someone unwilling to pursue discussion in the sub, and their followup comments confirm that --   I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about.      thats nice   followed by the infuriatingly disingenuous    It was nice. What's the problem?"
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,_watching,9,Thu Jul 16 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's very weird to assume God's primary goal is to make humans   No it isn't. Many Christians explicitly say that God's goal in creating life was to have creatures that could know and be known by him. After all, on Christianity God incarnates himself as a human to suffer and die in order to save human beings. Given this, humans are clearly of incomprehensible importance in the universe to God, if not centrally important, if he considers them worth being crucified for.    he also put a whole lot of effort into making vast, unoccupied sections of space   As Lewis pointed out, the size argument is not a good one. Size has nothing to do with importance. A man's leg is much bigger than his neocortex, but the latter is infinitely more important than the former. You cannot show that humans are not important in the grand scheme of the universe because we are relatively small in spatial terms.    Why does this assume God gives a shit about the suffering of animals?   Because on Christianity God is supposed to be morally perfect, and a morally perfect being would avoid unnecessary suffering.    there are two problems of evil that are levied against Christian God - humans are dicks to each other, and the planet is a dick to us. The former is easily handwaved with ""free will"". The latter is actually really difficult to answer.   Which is why I'm employing the latter, although with the slight twist of not focusing on natural human suffering but rather natural animal suffering, which is even more difficult to answer because it avoids the counter-argument that children with cancer for example are being challenged and edified spiritually through their suffering.    There's no concessions that this is an active discussion, or nuances to be explored. It's presented as an open and shut case.   It is presented as something which I think is true. I'm not going to imply concessions when I don't think I have to make any. People are free to challenge me and I will respond. It was a shame that my original comment was merely downvoted though."

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,master_ov_khaos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:43:22 2015 UTC,"Well the argument about suffering is a weak argument, God created man and has given them free will since the beginning which is why he didn't stop Adam and Eve from eating the fruit and wasn't watching them at all times, its why the Cain was able to murder Abel, if God stopped it then humans wouldn't really have free will. If there was no suffering then that would mean God would be intervening every time a man wanted to sin then man wouldn't really have free will and there wouldn't be a point to creating us, a living being that can think for itself, he may as well would have created machines that follow a program and can't deviate from it"

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,NeedsMoreReeds,5,Thu Jul 16 21:25:44 2015 UTC,"Well, intrinsic worth is what we want or think is valuable for its own sake.  Examples might be beauty, wisdom, happiness, and health.  Instrumental worth is what is good or valuable insofar as it contributes to or participates in those intrinsic values- being intelligent, prudent, skeptical, temperate, etc.  So, obedience to legitimate authorities might be a good instrumental trait to have- you obey when you should obey.  But the goodness of obedience does not consist in obedience itself, but some intrinsic value- you obey because it makes you and/or others better off, or increases the amount of an intrinsic value in the world.  We can ask: ""Why obey?"" and any legitimate authority could answer in terms of intrinsic value: ""Because to obey would to create value in some way (e.g make everyone happier or healthier)"""

The whole concept of 'sin' is a terrible way to think about morality and encourages Just World Hypothesis. It essentially shames you for your humanity, which is gross.  Disobeying your parents when you're a child doesn't mean anything done to you is your fault. It just means you disobeyed your parents.

It is not acceptable to burn children who don't listen to you.   But under the flimsy concept of sin, we literally deserve anything that happens to us because we're hideously evil human creatures. Any concept of justice or fairness is thrown out. If anything, the concept of scale is thrown out for the idea of sin. The child and the murderer are both sinners so it has no meaning. 'Sinner' is basically just a slur toward humans."

The child that touches the stove despite the parent's warnings received consequences to his actions. Who's saying anything about burning children? Parents are there to raise their children and teach them the importance of obeying the law while they're still in a low-stakes environment.   I get that you don't like the concept of sin, but really what else would you call it. The murderer and the child both disobeyed. Very different degrees of severity of course, but still the same fundamental concept. One broke the law, the other broke the parents' rules. Surely you don't deny that all humans can and do act wrongfully towards each other right?"
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,mosdefin,7,Thu Jul 16 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"All the concept of sin teaches you is that you are horrible just for your own existence.

The murderer and the child both disobeyed.   Disobedience isn't always a bad thing, whether its disobeying the law or disobeying your parents or disobeying your religion. What matters is that we make choices and those choices have consequences to ourselves and the people around us. Obedience isn't a virtue. Fuck obedience."

Fortunately for the child, he learned that while the stakes were still low and a burned hand was his only punishment.   You are right. There are some instances were it's right to disobey.

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,jokul,18,Thu Jul 16 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"Leibniz was famous for what became known as the ""best of all possible worlds"" answer (largely remembered as a joke because it was mocked in Candide).  He basically said that if the world is logically consistent and it also had to account for the existence of imperfect humans, then by a kind of butterfly effect there are going to be some aspects of existence that are less than ideal.  The claim is that any world better than the one we currently live in is impossible because it would violate cause and effect somehow.  It has the benefit of being entirely un-disprovable, but it puts any supporter in the awkward position of having to explain why a world without that earthquake that destroyed your house is logically impossible.  Well, the dude also believed in pre-ordained harmony between body and soul, another hilarious but un-disprovable idea.  Saint Irenaeus had something similar, based on the idea of transformative evil.  Since cause and effect are necessary and humans are imperfect, humans need hardship in order to spiritually grow and evolve.  Again, it leaves itself wide open to specific appeals to emotion (""do we really need this many diseases to know what hardship is?""), but the idea that a world with some difficulties in it is better than a world with none holds some water.  For a rigorous theological argument in favor, see that episode of The Twilight Zone where the mobster goes to ""heaven"" and he wins at everything 100% of the time.  That was a good episode.  So yeah, no solutions are entirely satisfactory theodicies, but I see the problem of evil brought up on the ""debate religion"" subs all the time, and seemingly every atheist believes that they were the first one to think of it."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,carl_sagans_ghost__,12,Thu Jul 16 15:44:50 2015 UTC,The claim is that any world better than the one we currently live in is impossible because it would violate cause and effect somehow   Wow this is complete nonsense.

SubredditDrama,3di8zp,carl_sagans_ghost__,8,Thu Jul 16 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I brought up the problem of natural evil, not because I believe nobody has ever heard of it before, but because I think it's a good argument that justifies believing that an omni-God does not exist. The problem of moral evil has a decent explanation; free will necessarily means that humans can choose evil, but the problem of natural evil has no such counter-argument. Specifically I refer to the problem of the unnecessary suffering of animals, because there is no possible counter-argument in which the theist claims that this natural suffering is edifying for creatures in some way.   Creatures have been evolving, suffering, and going extinct for millions of years, and this is unnecessary. If God's ultimate goal was to produce human beings for relationship with himself, being omnipotent he could have specially created human beings from the start for that purpose. So given this, what is more likely? That an omni-God created myriad ways of natural suffering for evolving creatures over millions of years, or that there is no such God and life on earth is ultimately accidental? I think the latter is clearly more likely, and I've yet to hear a theodicy which addresses my specific argument."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,GaiusPompeius,2,Fri Jul 17 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"That's certainly a fair point: both theodicies I mentioned are basically trying to explain natural evil, and while neither one is really convincing enough to change anybody's mind, they're mainly meant to reconcile existing faith with the problem of evil, so the believer can say their beliefs are still internally consistent.  So it's better to find problems with individual theodicies rather than stopping at just presenting the existence of evil.  As for your second point, the answer is pretty much part of the ""cause and effect"" parts of the theodicies.  Spiritual growth can't happen without trials, because that would be an effect without a cause and that's impossible in a logically consistent world.  As for the omnipotence paradox aspect of it (""Can't God do anything?""), the general answer is that any meaningful use of the word ""omnipotent"" must mean ""able to do all things that are logically possible"".  C.S. Lewis said that it's like asking why God can't create a square circle: the idea is self-contradictory and hence is a failure of human language that such a thing sounds meaningful to us in the first place.  So, the theodicies that stress the need for logical consistency in the world do kind of address your points, it's just that none of them are really convincing enough to change someone's mind unless they want to believe them.  But on the other hand, it's hard to attack them because you'd have to prove that counterfactuals are possible."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,sillet,6,Thu Jul 16 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"Spiritual growth can't happen without trials   There are problems here. God presumably has had no trials, and is at a spiritual apex. As far as I know the angels that God created were created in heaven from the start, no trials involved. Babies that die undergo no trials or growth on earth, and presumably they go to heaven and enjoy being in glory. And of course because God is simply omnipotent, there's nothing logically impossible about creating beings that already posses a certain level of spiritual ability/power, e.g. the angels.   Even if I grant that things like earthquakes, cancer, and bot flies and necessary for the spiritual development of human beings, that actually does nothing to address my argument which concerns the suffering of non-human animals over millions of years of the evolutionary process."
SubredditDrama,3di8zp,cruelandusual,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"Again coming from a Christian standpoint rather than my own personal beliefs: God is completely different than mankind and any attempt to anthropomorphize God is going to fail.  The Bible says practically nothing about the lives or histories of angels.  Different denominations have different ways of dealing with children who die during the ""age of innocence"": Catholics believe that since they are no guilty of any personal sin, their original sin can be absolved by the mercy of God (limbo is another idea).  And spiritual level isn't something that can be measured on a Dragonball Z scouter: evil is a privation which means that becoming is a different thing than being: not less desirable, but different.  As for animals, I guess they don't have souls, so maybe the noumenon of a dog doesn't experience suffering the same way a human does?  Again, non-disprovable unless you know how to experience the thing-in-itself!"

Even though they might not find them attractive personally, most people can acknowledge that the person pictured would be viewed as least above average by a majority of people.   Otherwise it just descends into this. Perhaps this is an interesting difference between how people regard attractiveness, he was being overly confident and presumptuous (imo so was the parent comment implying that the guys are all average with too high standards etc, and should jump at the chance of somebody who they don't find attractive messaging them, and they just responded in kind), but for most guys that I know, it wouldn't stop them admitting that the girl equivalent of that guy was still attractive.   Like this super edgy lady from this drama thread says she literally hates men (somewhere in there) and drinks from a 'male tears' cup,  I don't think she's a very nice person from what you can tell of her  (sometimes nsfw) post history, but I can still admit that she's attractive and people were even underneath her 'male tears' cup and in the drama thread (there are more examples if you want)."

I'm only criticising him to this extent because he seems very up his ass when we consider that he was waiting with imgur uploads of pictures of himself to randomly plop into conversations about how ""not average"" he is.   He is very average if you take everything into account, he could definitely be above average if he fixed those things so I stand by what I said."

I'm quite surprised by the exaggeration of men over 6 feet, I fall into that category, and don't really get why a man of that height would bump up his stats."

SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,SilverSpooky,28,Thu Jul 16 13:34:42 2015 UTC,That's probably just because most men don't take many pictures of themselves and/or don't really care about updating them on their social media.

It's kind of the odd part of online dating, I think, that people are simultaneously more and less guarded when it comes to their less desirable traits.   Maybe it's because I'm not dating, but why would it help to hide something like physical appearance? It's going to come out."

SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,srdov,15,Thu Jul 16 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"Based on my time on OkC, men post old photos of themselves from when they were in the best shape of their life.  I once went out with a guy who claimed to be an Elite Rugby Player and owner of a gym/personal trainer.  This was true, about a five years before we started talking.  He was easily 400lbs and required a rest break on the stairs up to his apartment.  It was really sad, honestly.  I ended up sticking around for the rest of the date out of pity, then politely brushed off his attempts at setting a second one.  And the thing is, I like bigger guys.  Not on death's door big, but larger than average.  Had he been honest and up front about his appearance, I might have gotten to know him better, or at least given him the benefit of the doubt.  Instead I spent the whole date trying to figure out if he was delusional, or if he just thought I was a complete idiot who wouldn't notice the difference.  Also, men seem to constantly add a few inches to their height.  Everyone is either 5'10"" or above, even if in person it's pretty clear they're rather short (and I'm 5'3"" so again, this isn't a trait I would have cared about, if they had been honest in the first place).  I did meet my (now) husband on Okcupid though, and he was exactly as advertised.  I even contacted him first and pursued him pretty strongly.  He's also a rather large dude."

I think it would be different if they allowed people to be as vague as they can be with weight (e.g. ""short"", ""average"", ""tall"")."
SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,libelecsBlackWolf,14,Fri Jul 17 05:32:19 2015 UTC,"From my dating experience, women use the angles to conceal things like weight gain while men use older photos of themselves (if they were thinner at some point, don't know what the rest would do but I haven't encountered that yet)."
SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,BigBadMrBitches,9,Thu Jul 16 14:53:42 2015 UTC,I wonder if men can be guilty of this as well?    Short guys not taking pictures that make them look smaller-than-average.
SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,notlizardperson,6,Thu Jul 16 14:46:31 2015 UTC,Yes they can. A lot of men have slim faces but huge bodies.

I think the difference is, when I've gone on dates and the guy is much larger than his pictures indicated, I stick around and have nice conversation and if he asks me out again I tell him thanks but the chemistry wasn't there.  I don't run and complain on ROKC.    They did some news story thing about this a while ago and men would often get angry/leave the date if she was fatter than her pictures while women just rolled with it, had a nice date, and were willing to get to know the guy before deciding on another date."

I'm not saying there's not anything to that, but I remember something like this making the rounds on the internet and there were some problems with it. For example the guy acknowledged that he had gained significant weight weight while the girl (broad? dame? There was a topic about this just yesterday.) acted like she only gained a few pounds. The guy still acted like charming person while the girl didn't. Also the girl's fat makeup didn't look good. She didn't look like she simply gained weight, she looked like there was something medically wrong with her."
SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,seshfan,3,Thu Jul 16 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but I think the audience of OKC is mostly men. So more of the pictures posted will be of women's profiles and users are more likely to identify with the same experiences they've had."

A girl living with her parents in Italy or wherever might be able to go drinking and spend the night at my house on a whim, but women in the US I've met seem to have to always have to notify their parents of anything so they can't be as spontaneous, and they also want me to meet their parents far sooner.

I'd rather make good choices and move out when I can financially support myself and help out of parents while I'm here since they don't make much money themselves.

Because your primary rubric for contacting a person is going to be appearance, you don't get the organic experience of being introduced to someone at a BBQ or cocktail party whose looks might not initially blow you out of the water but whose personality or character or sense of humor is so stellar they captivate you almost immediately. Like, if I saw a pic of Amy Schumer I wouldn't immediately be amazed, but if I met her at a party I'm pretty sure I'd be all heart-eyes emoji at her in three minutes flat.

People really underestimate how much a personality or emotional connection can make you physically attracted to another person.

SubredditDrama,3dhg9q,pineapple2048,8,Thu Jul 16 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"I just saw the coolest ted talk about this. Apparently the normal sequence for sex is a 4-part process: desire > arousal > orgasm > resolution. But in a significant percentage of the population, desire and arousal are inverted - meaning that for a lot of people, they simply don't get horny organically. Most people just experience desire as a free-floating thing; something makes them think about sex, which sparks desire, which leads to arousal then to orgasm.   So for a lot of ""dead bedroom"" couples, you have one person who just doesn't THINK about sex very often. Their brains need physical stimulation - physical arousal - before the actual desire phase kicks in and they remember ""Oh yeah, I DO like having sex."" They don't have a negative sex drive, just a dormant one.  The counselor who gave the talk basically said that the best way to deal with this is for the ""inverted desire"" partner to not reject advances from the higher libido partner, for a couple of reasons: first, because the higher libido partner has a need for sex, and so the low-desire partner should compromise for that reason (because that is how healthy partnerships work), but ALSO because most of the time, the low-desire partner will actually really get into and enjoy sex once physical arousal has been accomplished.   So basically date nights and scheduled sex are a good thing for inverted desire/arousal people. I thought that was interesting."

Most people will be within one standard deviation on a normalized curve.  So, if we assume that there's a really sharp clustering around ""5"" and then some outliers in both directions, five could still be the average and most people could still be (close enough to the average to be called) average.

I guess the simplest way to put it would be this: if the US has an average ten year ranking that includes the ups and downs of sports is currently 8 (made that number up) then the number would be 1 to 5 (again, made up) if we had our best athletes playing the sport.

But sort of like them (except the fact that you are already far better than them at football), there is more keeping you back than just athletes. You're a nation of 300-odd million. You've already got a fair number of people playing the game. The problem isn't really manpower, it's developing a footballing and coaching culture.

I think you're looking at this the wrong way. The US doesn't dominate women's soccer because they have objectively better athletes than the rest of the world, they dominate because they were first to embrace the sport. For the past 20 years, no other country has had the sheer amount of players as the US, so it makes sense that they've always been extremely competitive internationally. As we saw this year with the expanded 24 team field and record worldwide ratings, more people are starting to care, which will lead to more investment by more nations, which will close the gap that exists between the traditional powers like the US and the newer arrivals like the Colombians.  On the other hand, most nations on the men's side are already at or near their potential, so it's not like the US can walk into dominance unless we disband the NBA and NFL to force the best athletes into soccer."

The only event that would come remotely close to a worldwide best-on-best competition would probably be the Olympics, and that's never really been dominated by any country (although the US is always near the top of the medal count).   My assumption is that so long as soccer is the first choice for women in this country, we will continue our dominance regardless of the resources/effort put into it by other countries.   The head start that you have will probably last a few more player cycles, but I really think that there's so much untapped potential in the sport globally that the dominance will have to end one day. Countries like Argentina haven't even got their program off the ground and into the WWC yet. You've got to think that the women have a somewhat comparable talent level to the men, so who knows what will happen when they start to receive a higher level of coaching and training from a young age?

I've got these numbos responding to me saying ""it's not about height!"" And they're right.

It folded after 3 years. Japan's women (who reached the women's world cup final) play in an amateur league, while the US women now play in a semi-pro league.

Its still not even broadcast in the overwhelming majority of countries.  4) Canada got to host the women's World Cup because no other country wanted it.  5) For the last Women's World Cup, 93% of the total global TV viewership was from the USA.  6) Over 22.8 million Americans watched the final game. This is comparable to the World Series Finals (men's baseball) and NBA Finals (men's basketball). Nowhere else on the planet does women's soccer get even a quarter of this audience.  7) The current US women's team coach is from England, yet she never played soccer in England as there were no leagues. She came to the US and only started playing soccer there.   8) Women's soccer was banned in England until 1971. The Football Assocation claimed that ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females"".  9) The US women's player Alex Morgan earns over $3 million per year, and gets nationwide advertising campaigns and is a household name. Other players like Hope Solo, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm are also household names.  10) England's highest paid women's soccer player earns £65,000 per year and had a part time job. Most women's players are amateur, and among those few who do get paid almost all are semi-pro. For comparison sakes, England soccer star Wayne Rooney earns £300,000 (about $470,000) EVERY SINGLE WEEK Ronaldo earned $80 million last year, Messi $72 million."

Height means nothing if you do not have the positioning, reflexes, agility, aerial ability (hint, just because you're tall doesn't mean you know how to catch a ball that is being crossed) and many other qualities even the shit keepers have.

It's fine to question if he would know positioning (but the fair arguement is to assume he has been trained since he was a kid), however to question anything about athletic ability (reflexes, agility, aerial ability) is insane. Those are all things that are directly releated to basketball and he would be among the best in all three categories while be bigger than all his competitors in the individual categories. The only arguement that can make sense is if smaller players inheretly have an advantage in soccer.  Under your logic Dez Bryant wouldn't be able to be a good defensive Center Fielder because he isn't used to how the ball travels off the bat. All that boils down to is inexperience. Start him when he's a freshman in high school and he'd be a Golden Glove candidate. Catching a ball is catching a ball no matter the sport and requires the same talents."

SuperBunnyhop - Kojima vs. Konami: An Investigation sums up the rumors leading up to this video which contains supposed internal emails about what had been going on at Konami which put Konami in a pretty damning light. The Jimquisition - Konami is Konami: This video was released a few days after the above video (which was DMCA'd by Konami btw)  covering some of Konami's previous fuck ups in the past few years and their awful habit of burning bridges with anyone they work with in the industry ESPECIALLY on the press side.
SubredditDrama,3dhocp,xXKILLA_D21Xx,6,Thu Jul 16 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"Konami has been very spiteful towards Kojima lately, and I really can't see Kojima wanting his name taken off the box. It's possible, but very unlikely.  Honestly it's not unusual. When Konami and Kojima split, they literally just started removing his name from his previous games and tore down his projects. They canceled Silent Hills, going so far as to remove the free (and quite awesome) playable teaser, PT, from the Playstation store. Just recently they shut down Kojima studios when they were working crunch time on MGSV, so there might not be any post-launch support (hopefully Konami isn't that spitefull). They are really trying to scorch Kojimas work, and it's not good."
SubredditDrama,3dhocp,InvalidArgument56,6,Thu Jul 16 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"And I would be willing to bet that 90% or more of the people who buy MGS V know who Kojima is, and know he was involved in this game."

SubredditDrama,3dhocp,robotortoise,3,Thu Jul 16 16:16:33 2015 UTC,It's interesting that a lot of these types of developers/directors are Japanese because the other person who came to mind for me was Hidetaka Miazaki. The Souls series isn't nearly as popular but most people in that fanbase know that he's the one who's really driving the series forward. The only American who comes to mind immediately is Ken Levine but he doesn't have anywhere near the fame or recognition than some Japanese directors have.

Japanese gaming culture is a bit different from western culture in that regard actually. Their game developers are more well know and have more of a celebrity status. That's not very common in the west, at least not yet. We know some old legends such as Carmack, Shafer, Molyneux and Ramero. We also know of the ones who had a mental breakdown such as Phil Fish. I think it's kind of sad. An auteur driven gaming scene is quite interesting. Board games can sell based on the designer alone. You know what to expect. Same with movies. If it has Michael Bay on the cover, you know what you get. Same if it says Wes Anderson. I hope the Japanese auteur movement spreads to the rest of the world."

SubredditDrama,3diac1,zaron5551,6,Thu Jul 16 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense for Atheists to entertain the notion either way.  Jesus being a real person or not has no bearing on the core tenant of atheism.   Moreover, Jesus is one of the most redeemable characters in the bible; why pick a fight with everyone who doesn't agree exactly with you, especially when your motives are political. It's as odd of an obsession as it is poor strategery."

SubredditDrama,3diac1,mrpeach32,-6,Thu Jul 16 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"Christianity makes very few statements about actual facts.  Most of what they talk about is their particular belief in magic.  Since, apparently, it is taboo to argue against their magic or ask for proof of it we are forced to instead argue against the few facts that they present if you want to try and argue against the stranglehold their belief in magic has on the politics and culture of large portions of the world.  Those facts pretty consistently turn out to be false or at least highly suspect. That's what leads so many militant types to argue against historical Jesus even if it isn't a particularly good hill to die on."
SubredditDrama,3diac1,Alchemistmerlin,8,Thu Jul 16 16:29:57 2015 UTC,What? It's no less taboo to criticize the existence of Jesus than it is to criticize any other aspect of Christianity. It's just more wrong.
SubredditDrama,3diac1,_watching,2,Thu Jul 16 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Like I said, its a bad hill to die on.  I agree that it is the wrong fact to focus on because its generally agreed on by historians that there was at least one dude in the area named Jesus who did things.  My point was that the desire to focus on facts is what leads some folks to that arguing point.   As for why they get stuck there? Stubbornness mostly.  Jesus factually not existing would be a super helpful tool for the sort of person who wants to see the Christian churches less powerful in the US so some folks fixate on it despite being told otherwise."
SubredditDrama,3diac1,Alchemistmerlin,5,Thu Jul 16 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Dude. The guy existed. Contemporary Roman governors and the Jewish ruling class discuss and analyze him at length. If he didn't exist they literally could have talked to their associates who were there and waved the whole thing away.  You don't spend laborious text books worth of writings disproving the miracles of a guy who never existed. Especially not when you were present for the proceedings   Not to mention, no one would have been on board with something that supposedly happened in their town. Christianity started in jerusalem with the people who lived there.   They wouldn't have said ""oh hey a guy who never lived was executed right there and I totes didn't see it or his thousands of supposed followers. and I never say him almost starting a revolution in my temple that I live in.  I better believe this to the point of being killed myself.""  They would have said ""bullshit, there was no preacher named Jesus, becuase I was fucking there"" and it would have ended with that.     Whether or not he was the messiah is the only question of worth and it's not one that can be answered objectively.    The dude existed. Get the fuck over it. arguing otherwise is ignorant and stupid. Disbelieve the magic all you want. Bhudda existed too. So did alexander the great, and documentation for both of them is sketchier than jesus.   Modern, credible historians will tell you the same thing."

SubredditDrama,3diac1,SkrongLikeViking,11,Thu Jul 16 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"The idea that one jewish guy started a big revolution back in the Roman Empire just sounds like bullshit.   What revolution are you referring to? Christianity wasn't exactly an armed uprising that toppled the government, its a religion that became more and more popular over time.    People that are commiting sedition get dealt with swiftly and always have.   ...That's exactly what happened to him. Remember the whole cross thing? Kind of a big part of the Jesus story?  Not to mention, we have a ton of more modern examples of one person starting a movement that winds up being incredibly influential years later. Hell, look at Mormonism - you can argue against its beliefs, but it'd be idiotic to argue that Joseph Smith couldn't have existed."
SubredditDrama,3diac1,fungwah,6,Thu Jul 16 21:59:51 2015 UTC,"Apparently   dude is latched onto by Jews looking for a Messiah and quickly killed after short career preaching - small religious movement is expanded by evangelists bringing in intrigued non-Jews, who steadily expand the faith despite persecution   is just fucking outlandish, lol."
SubredditDrama,3diac1,_watching,2,Thu Jul 16 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"I just belive one man wouldn't have been allowed to get away with sedition for as long as Jesus did.   Well, if we take the Gospels as accurate about Jesus's teachings and death, he wasn't being seditious outright (a lot of the discussion between him and the Pharisees are them trying to trick him into acknowledging that he actually opposes Rome, which he refuses to do). Not to mention the minute he shows up in the capital, they kill him a week later. That's not exactly letting him run around being seditious for that long.   It seems more logical to me that many men were spreading those philosophies and continuously getting executed.    Sure, and there's a whole legacy of that after Jesus's death - Peter supposedly gets killed in Rome, etc. That doesn't really discount the existence of someone to start the whole thing, though.   Joseph Smith wasn't a threat to an Empire and wasn't a revolutionary figuire.   Maybe not in the same way, but if you look at the early history of the Mormon Church, they were definitely seen as a threat to society. Smith himself even got killed by a mob after being charged with treason after declaring martial law in the city he ran. (Wiki with more info)   Ideas are harder to destroy than one man.    Sure, that's the whole point of the story! Jesus gets killed, his followers take over, Christianity spreads. Honestly, I'd suggest you read up on the early Christian church - the story of how it spreads and evolves under Roman rule is pretty fascinating."
SubredditDrama,3diac1,fungwah,4,Thu Jul 16 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"I was very intrigued by arguments about The Nazarene, and I think at least for me it was because it's one of those rare situations where Christianity makes claims about the Natural World.  So, from a historical perspective if we can reliably reconstruct the life of this person, or point to where certain Biblical claims just don't make any sense, then it sort of poisons the well.  That sort of stuff is very appealing."

I understand the need for them though, as the entire subreddit will be a clusterfuck if people are just allowed to go crazy.    I think one good solution would be to ""refresh"" the megathread after a certain amount of time.    I'll explain what I mean by this with an example.  Instead of having one megathread for drama over the course of 20 hours with 2500 comments like yesterday.. have 5 mega threads, one every 4 hours, with something like 500 comments a piece.  Hide the previous megathreads when a new one is created, but make sure the older ones are all linked in the newest one so that they're still visible.    4 hours each might be too much or too little, and obviously the comments won't be evenly divided, but it will still be better than what goes on now.  You could even make it a comment limit instead of a time limit for when the drama starts to die down, or just refresh the thread whenever new things happen if you really want to take a more proactive stance.    This will allow new comments to reach the top, allow the drama to be shifted onto new topics without erasing the old ones, continually push the newer content to people's front page, probably make the drama a bit more organized, keep the subreddit from becoming a clusterfuck of threads, and it will even give the creators of the megathreads a chance to pass the burden of keeping it updated onto someone else if they want.      Its a little extra work, but I think it will be worth it."

The stickied thread would serve as a means of organizing all of the littler threads-- it would be updated live with links to individual threads.  If we did a megathread every 5 hours, I think we might run into the same problem of stuff getting buried, and we wouldn't be able to keep up with the latest news by skimming the front page. Think of a newspaper; the biggest drama should be featured in the most prominent place and should have it's own headline.   Sorry if this is confusing, I'm on my phone at work.

SubredditDrama,3df467,SimulatedFamily,24,Wed Jul 15 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"This.  Megathreads are a helpful resource, but having multiple dedicated threads to specific things help foster discussion.    The front page of SRD tomorrow should basically be given over to this, Oh Highest Holy Histrionics Day.  For all other dramas are baser, and therefore, deserve lesser status in the eyes of the dramaturg."
SubredditDrama,3df467,Gandesa,44,Wed Jul 15 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you to all of the SRD mods for overseeing this beautiful shitstorm and for offering us this space for community feedback about mod policies. I'm currently writing this on my break at work, so it's not going to be as eloquent as I'd like it to be, and I'll be back later with clarifications.     Let's talk about megathreads.  Yesterday, our benevolent Lord Yishan bestowed unto us a particularly buttery comment which quickly spawned a magnificent SRD thread. That thread was how I learned about Yishan's comment, and it was clearly quite popular (receiving nearly 500 upvotes and 530 comments before it was removed), so I was very surprised to see that it was removed by the mod team only a couple of hours after it had been posted. I completely understand why the mods want to keep the front page clean and tidy (and you all do a great job) but I think that, in this case, the SRD policy of condensing all related posts into a single megathread served to bury the most interesting drama of all, which should have been featured on the front page for all to see.   /u/TLH053 did a great job of addressing the problem with megathreads in this comment (+180). To quote from her comment, reducing all of the glorious drama to a single post is a problem because, among other reasons:    ""Half the time I hear about this drama is when it makes it to my front page, which doesn't happen if everything has to be contained to one constantly updated thread for 10-15 hours."" ""Its annoying to go through comments looking for ones on a specific part of the drama when everything on top is from several hours before it even happened and everything in new is a collection of shit from dozens of threads from different parts of the drama."" ""When you sort by new, you wind up being forced to see all the shitposts you wouldn't have otherwise bothered with or would have been removed before you saw them"" ""Its just not real interesting to have to keep checking the same thread and hoping there was an update while also not getting to truly discuss anything related to any of the updated parts without going through a bunch of unrelated or shit comments""   Edit: I want to again emphasize the fact that many people only learn about this metadrama when SRD posts reach the front page of Reddit. I'm sure that the post about Yishan's comment would have hit the front page if it had stayed up, which would have enabled his comment to be seen by a much wider audience. It's also great for SRD when our posts hit the front page-- it boosts our membership and brings more people into the conversation. We're shooting ourselves in the foot by limiting ourselves to one post.  Yes, having multiple threads will mean that this drama will dominate the SRD front page, but shouldn't it? IMO, this kind of  metadrama is far more interesting than the everyday stuff that's featured here. The fact that the megathread has over 2500+ comments is a testament to the fact that this discussion is to big to be contained to a single thread.     So, here is my proposed solution to the megathread problem:    One big stickied post featuring a regularly updated narrative summary of all of the drama, complete with witty commentary like the beautiful recap threads we've seen in the past. IMO, threads like this are more skimmable than live feeds and do a great job of summarizing drama in an entertaining way.  PLUS individual posts for major events. This would make it easy to figure out what's going on just by skimming the SRD front page, and SRD posts about really big stuff like Yishan's comment would reach the front page of reddit. The main stickied post would contain links to the individual threads in order to keep everything organized.  Mods would use their discretion to remove repeat posts or minor posts that clutter the sub (I'd say that if a post has been up for a few hours and it hasn't received many upvotes, it can be safely removed).    Think of a newspaper. It should be organized so that the biggest drama is highlighted and easy to find.   IIRC, this is how SRD has handled most metadrama in the past, and it has worked beautifully. I'm going to go look for examples, I'll update when I find some.  Let me know what you think.    Edit: If anyone here subs to ASOIAF, think of how they handled the final episode of season 5-- there were individual threads for each part of the story, and one big stickied thread that linked to all of them. This was a very effective way of organizing things and keeping good discussions from getting buried under shitposts."

Me and you apparently:   Signing a non-disparagement indicates that you have no intention to do this, so the company can then say ""Ok, if anyone comes asking for a reference on this guy, we needn't say he was fired, just give a mildly positive reference."" Even if you don't sign the non-disparagement, the company will give you the benefit of the doubt and not disparage you or make any negative statements first.

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,W_LothianAnswer,10,Thu Jul 16 12:46:13 2015 UTC,"As an American, its interesting to see people in other countries where gun ownership is significantly lower than the US argue over things like knife crime and taser ownership.  Things like this aren't talked about at all here because the discussion is so gun-centric.    I've honestly never in my life thought about whether or not it is ok for someone to carry a taser."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,MisdemeanorOutlaw,9,Thu Jul 16 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of it is that in the UK, most people generally accept that if there is a crime - you get yourself somewhere safe and wait for the police. The police usually turn up in five minutes. This is because dealing with criminals as a civilian increases the risk of injury or death and can make it more complicated if it goes to court.   On top of that, tasers can cause breathing difficulties and can be deadly when used on people with heart conditions. There have been a couple of incidents where the UK police have tasered people and it has resulted in their death. That is in the hands of trained professionals. And honestly? That's fine by me. I live in a high crime area and have never once even felt scared. This is even at night, I'm not sure anyone in this country really needs a weapon to defend themselves. Might be different in the states.    On top of that, if they were legal and easily available, you kinda don't want criminals having easy access to something that could incapacitate people."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,spacecanucks,7,Thu Jul 16 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that tasers can potentially be deadly.  I was just staying that it seems odd in comparison to the U.S. because it's basically the exact same conversation that people have about guns over here, only about a weapon that is infinitely less dangerous."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,MisdemeanorOutlaw,3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"It definitely is weird. It's weird the other way, we can't even carry pepper spray here and over the pond, you guys can have guns. You can't even collect historical guns here unless you destroy their ability to fire."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,spacecanucks,3,Thu Jul 16 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true, I'm almost certain that Historical guns can be kept untouched as long as you have a powder License."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,reducedosprey,2,Thu Jul 16 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but last time I checked there are a fuckton of hoops to jump through, so for most casual people, it's easier to just have it rendered useless. I think the ideal is being somewhere rural, living alone with access to suitable storage, no history of mental illness, being a member of re-enactment societies and such. It's almost impossible if you live in a city.   It has been a while since I last checked, mind you."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,spacecanucks,2,Thu Jul 16 16:32:17 2015 UTC,I think it is more common than you might think outside or urban areas. Yes there are hoops to jump though but most farmers now know the ins and outs of the process better than most police officers.
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,SkrongLikeViking,3,Thu Jul 16 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Just on the point of the tazers being lethal thing. Generally speaking fist fighting is more lethal than a taser.  If a cop comes after you with a baton it's going to kill you easier and faster than a taser, designed expressly to inflict pain, can. They will rarely kill, and not even remotely as often as other methods.   Another issue with the uk is that they can devote more of their money and resources to policing a few largish metropolitan areas and a couple of  officers each in rural areas. More money in a geographically miniscule area makes for very effective enforcement.   In the US an area the size of the UK might only be policed by ten officers at any given time and the same population is hugely distributed. In large cities, the funding aspect is still an issue because the state is expected to run the enforcement show with minimal federal support.   We're basically trying to control an area larger than Europe with a smaller population and fewer resources. So things aren't so easy as in a place like Switzerland where a bicycle can get you across the country in under a weekend or the military can respond to anything in under 10 minutes notice.     In rural areas, police response time in a deadly emergency might be 45 minutes, if it comes at all. One time my dad almost got into a violent altercation with a drunk who threatened to come back and kill him.   My dad called the cops who sent one officer who arrived 45 minutes later, driving over 100 miles per hour. He arrived just 2 minutes ahead of the drunk who was now armed.    And according to official crime statistics, the UKs per capita violent crime rate is nearly double that of the US, but murder rate is significantly lower. So you're more likely to be violently assaulted in the UK, but less likely to die from such an encounter."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,spacecanucks,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't think I was criticizing the US. I'm not. I get that the US has different needs and can't function the same way.  That said, just because the US is bigger, doesn't mean that LE should be as shitty as it is in metropolitan USA.   Just because a taser is much less likely to be fatal, doesn't mean that regular civilians should have access to them. They're just not needed.   On top of that, the US actually has a higher rate of violent crime. When you see statistics for the UK, they are crimes against the person. The 'violent' crime could be as simple as threatening someone or throwing beer into their faces, it can also be a sexual crime (even groping). The US definition of violent crime is aggravated assault, robbery and rape."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,rick_from_chicago,16,Fri Jul 17 00:35:41 2015 UTC,"Man, I had no idea taser ownership could be a contentious issue in countries that aren't the US. Seems like a pretty innocuous thing for a person to carry, comparatively."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,AndyLorentz,10,Thu Jul 16 13:18:19 2015 UTC,"Ironically, in some places in the U.S., you can get a license to carry a concealed handgun, but it's illegal to carry a concealed taser."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,fuckthepolis2,5,Thu Jul 16 14:49:58 2015 UTC,Laws for stuff like that gets weird fast in some countries.    You really want to make carrying tasers legal? I'm pretty sure that would benefit the attackers more so than potential victims.   I don't get this line of thought.  Something is legal so now the people intent on doing crimes can...do crimes?
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,MrSirHoppus,17,Thu Jul 16 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"Makes it easier for people to commit crimes yeah.  The problem people never really get is that criminality isn't as clear cut as; I want to commit a crime, I shall go out and commit said crime and nothing can stop me.  It's more often than not, ""This just became a whole lot easier to do"" and so they do it. Right now, tasers are illegal and hard to find, so there's obviously not a lot of taser crime. Tasers become legal, there's gonna be a lot of people who either couldn't stomach stabbing someone or didn't want to go to jail for that or assault, who'd now be realising they could pretty much tase/incapacitate someone and do whatever they were planning, and it'd be hell of a lot easier.  Hell, even non-criminals, get in a drunken fight outside a bar. Pull out a taser. Argument with your spouse, taser. Idiot sixteen year olds who want to taser someone, taser. With crime, it's as much whether or not there's an avenue for it, as it is anything. It's why you lock your doors. Sure, there's probably a thief out there who wants to get into your house, come rain or shine, but if you've got an unlocked open door, then even a normal everyday guy who had no ""intent on doing crime"" might consider taking a peak and taking advantage of this opportunity."

I live in a not too legitimate end of my city, and I never really have to worry about getting stabbed or shot or anything if there are some lads loitering about because they don't posses the means to do so.  But, you legalise tasers, suddenly me walking home at night and getting a bit of verbal stick from them could escalate into something more dangerous because they have the means to do so."

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,alyalyaly123xd,3,Fri Jul 17 00:00:10 2015 UTC,"Assumed it'd be easier in comparison to getting physical. Tazer requires getting near somebody and shooting them. Whacking them with a pipe involves strength, also has the risk of them fighting back.  Both work it just seems to me like a tazer would be easier to use, would give them the edge in a fight"

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,Aegeus,8,Thu Jul 16 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"He means they could commit crimes more easily.  Sure you could commit crimes with anything, even without a knife, but having the right tool for the job makes it easier.  I don't know if that's true - it seems logical for guns, but I dunno if Tasers are so much more effective that they'll change the game for criminals.  I've never tried robbing someone."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,reducedosprey,10,Thu Jul 16 14:08:08 2015 UTC,The thinking behind it is that if you are threatened during a Robbery the criminal is far more likely to shoot you with a Taser instead of a gun as they can follow through of their threats of violence without becoming a murder.

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,hoodoo-operator,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:46:42 2015 UTC,"the UK is kinda weird about weapons (I'm saying this as an american though). Owning pepper spray is completely illegal. Not carrying, just owning it is illegal. It's actually in the same legal category as machine guns, because it's considered a poison gas, so even if you have a gun license you can't buy it.  I can totally understand regulating deadly weapons, but banning completely nonlethal weapons that are purely defensive seems to weird to me."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,Mephistopholees,18,Thu Jul 16 15:22:36 2015 UTC,purely defensive    I'm fairly certain I can use pepper spray offensively
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,hoodoo-operator,-4,Thu Jul 16 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"well you could, but in practice the criminal use of pepper spray is pretty rare. I mean, most criminals generally want to rob people, and that's fairly difficult to do after you pepper sprayed. Threatening them with a knife or gun so they give you their stuff is more effective and more common.  Honestly the same thing kind of goes for tasers too. They hurt but they don't really cause serious injury (though the high powered ones police use can), and because of that they don't really lend themselves to criminal use."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,Statoke,10,Thu Jul 16 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, most criminals generally want to rob people, and that's fairly difficult to do after you pepper sprayed.    People wouldn't go out and buy pepper spray because they wouldn't thing they need it, carrying protection is not a British thing at all. But you know who might buy it, a criminal. It would make robberies much easier because you'd spray the victim and they can't fight back because they're in pain."
SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,hoodoo-operator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said, they're both legal here, and it doesn't happen.

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,gamas,5,Thu Jul 16 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"But guns are illegal (in most cases) here as well. The fact is, most robberies are crimes of opportunity. Whilst robbers could go out and purchase a gun on the black market, its an awful lot of effort and risk just to go out and commit petty theft. Knives, knuckle dusters and pepper sprays work just as easily as an intimidation strategy.  Gun crime in the UK is usually reserved just for organised crime. You can avoid ever being a victim of gun crime in the UK by never getting involved with gangs or buying illicit goods through a smuggling ring (and also by not making an enemy out of some upper class rural sycophant, as they most likely have legal hunting rifles - that Agatha Christie shit does actually happen in the Tory heartlands)."

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,hoodoo-operator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point was just that in practice weapons like knives and knuckle dusters and clubs are much better at intimidation than weapons that are specifically designed to not do any damage, like pepper spray.  Like, I said, it's just surprising that a weapon that doesn't actually do any harm is illegal, because that seems like the one type of weapon that would be allowed. But in the UK there seems to be a huge amount of opposition, both culturally and legally, to using any kind of weapon in self defense, even things that are fairly harmless."

SubredditDrama,3dhzdj,serpentine91,3,Thu Jul 16 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if taser use by criminals would increase if tasers were legal in the UK. I currently do not have data at hand but I presume most criminals are poor and commit robberies because they either suffer from financial hardships, need money for drugs, or both. I don't believe that many of them would use some of the money they robbed of people to buy a comparatively expensive taser. (I think the gun-like versions go for 300-500 €) Pepper spray is legal were I live and I can't remember hearing about a robbery being committed with it which might be due to it also being seen as a weapon for women who are afraid of rapists.  Concerning my personal opinion on the whole self defense tools topic, I usually do not carry more than 50€ if I know I will be out late at night and I carry an extendable baton with me. The later is mostly because I feel safer with it, despite knowing that even though I live in the ""bad"" part of town the chances of actually being robbed are pretty low as long as you don't intentionally walk through a certain park at night which is known for being popular with drug dealers. Secondly, as most sane self defense instructors will tell you, if someone threatens you and wants your money you should give him your money because he will most likely go away and money is easier to replace than your health. I believe self defense tools, or weapons are most beneficial for women because they might actually encounter a rapist, and unless they've trained for a couple of years I would consider their chances in an unarmed fight against a determined, taller and stronger attacker pretty slim."

Furthermore, unlike most Redditors, he never lurked. He jumped right in. Because of that I expect that he doesn't really know the passive side of Reddit, sitting back and watching everything unfold. He does it out of habit and for him Reddit just works differently.   Sharing content can be extremely exciting and it's a good time killer."

SubredditDrama,3df7oz,workpuppy,29,Thu Jul 16 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"His ability to accumulate karma upsets some people for ... really no good reason.    I've been on reddit a while now and I dislike him, but not because he has a lot of karma.   I know it's cool for kids these days to be counter culture and the truly hip kids are anti-counter culture, and the super hip are the ones who claim to be above it all, but I look at it from a logical (somewhat selfish) standpoint:   Accidental reposting is normal and fine. It's going to happen and it's inevitable. Sometimes even purposeful reposting is fine if it's been a while since something was last posted, but reposting for the sake of reposting adds nothing new to reddit. It's not OC and over time, has a net negative effect on reddit because it drowns out original content. Reposts directly and indirectly hurt original content. And I like OC, so my reasons for disliking him are a bit selfish.  I think reddit should be encouraging original and unique content and reposting for the sake of it is the antithesis of that."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,mentop,5,Thu Jul 16 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"Shrug. Most of the stuff I see of his, I've never seen before. And all his crossposting means that it makes it out of the defaults to the second and third tier subs I frequent, which I appreciate."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,workpuppy,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's bad for 2 reasons; One, stealing content for crossposting means people won't ever leave the larger subreddits to find interesting stuff and discover amazing new niche communities. The whole point of the subreddit system is that content can get divided up and segmented off. Crossposting defeats the purpose of people having to leave the big subs. People should be exploring reddit.   Secondly, even if it's stuff you haven't seen before, the odds of him posting stuff you have seen before go up every day you're on this site. It may not affect you personally but I see what OP is saying, it has a negative effect on reddit overall. That is, if there was less reposts, that means there would be more original content by default. You may be content with what he does, but that doesn't mean your experience couldn't be even better. Why settle for mediocrity?"
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,smileyman,4,Thu Jul 16 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fallacious assumption. If there was no crossposting, the vast majority of content would show up briefly in a default, and then vanish, and never be seen by any niche communities at all.  As for ""a negative effect on reddit overall"" I disagree completely. I see the same shit all the time, and while he may crosspost like a demon, he does it with fresh content.   You call it a repost because it shows up in more than one place, but I see things I've seen over and over for years making the frontpage, and compared to that, I don't really give a damn if I see something I've only seen once show up in two different subs."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,Galle_,17,Thu Jul 16 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"And I like OC, so my reasons for disliking him are a bit selfish.   What the hell are you doing on any place on reddit then? There are maybe a half dozen to a dozen subs that are actually dedicated to original content, and if you're subscribed to any of the major pic or gif subs then you have no fucking excuse, because the vast majority of that content isn't original.   This whole argument is ridiculous. First, the vast majority of content that gets posted to reddit is taken from somewhere else. Very, very little of it is original content.  Secondly, what Gallowboob does isn't actually reposting. He cross posts stuff to other subs that he thinks might enjoy it. That's as legitimate as the same news article showing up at /r/books, /r/fantasy, /r/asoiaf, and /r/gameofthrones because it talks about Martin. Nobody accuses those people of ""reposting"", or ""crossposting"", or some other such drivel.   Thirdly, not everybody has the same god damn fucking front page as everybody else. I can always tell when someone is subscribed to one of the default pic or gif subs because when something shows up in one of the smaller subs that I'm subscribed to they whine about it being reposted. Guess what? I'm not subscribed to any of the defaults, and my front page is decidedly not the same front page as yours or any other redditors.   So who fucking cares if he takes content from one sub and posts it to another sub? Downvote that shit and move on if you don't like it."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,Ebu-Gogo,7,Thu Jul 16 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"Nobody ""accuses"" those people of crossposting, because it totally is crossposting, and crossposting to multiple relevant subs is totally acceptable, even praiseworthy.  I honestly do not understand what the issue people have with GallowBoob is. He's part of the background at the absolute worst."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,buzzkillpop,8,Thu Jul 16 02:41:37 2015 UTC,I just feel an innate dislike for powerusers.  Though I don't really spend much time actively hating the guy. The people who keep derailing every thread he's in are worse.
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,QnA,2,Thu Jul 16 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"As another commenter pointed out, you do realize that crossposting and reposting are two very separate things, and they're not mutually exclusive, right? Just because someone crossposts doesn't mean they don't repost."
SubredditDrama,3df7oz,GhostofRFS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:18:18 2015 UTC,"What the hell are you doing on any place on reddit then?   You can be a cynic if you want (the kids think that's hip too, it's not) but reddit has a lot of places where there is original content aplenty. You just have to subscribe to the right subreddits. Reddit is what you make of it, if your front page sucks, then that's on you friend.    There are maybe a half dozen to a dozen subs that are actually dedicated to original content   Wha? I have at least 50 that are dedicated to original content in my subscriptions just off the top of my head. There are hundreds, if not more with a focus on OC. Sure, some are smaller and more niche but it's a far cry from a half a dozen.   This whole argument is ridiculous.    And yet, my comment appeared to get under your skin. Your comment comes across as slightly hostile considering that my comment was mostly just an observation (and less of a critique) that I did also admit was mostly for selfish reasons.    Thirdly, not everybody has the same god damn fucking front page as everybody else.   Aggressive, aren't we. You didn't read my comment, or comprehend it. I never said anything about me seeing reposts. I said it has a net negative effect on reddit overall. My post was about the meta impact on reddit from these serial reposters.   I'm subscribed to they whine about it being reposted.   I was ""whining"" about reposts in general, as a concept, because it drags the site quality down as a whole. I'm not affected by it personally all that much.    Secondly, what Gallowboob does isn't actually reposting.   First, my comment was more about serial reposters in general (which does include the likes of GallowBoob). Secondly, Gallowboob does repost. Yes, he also cross-posts but that doesn't mean he isn't reposting shit either. He gets busted & called out all the time for it. Being a cross poster and being a reposter are not mutually exclusive things.   So who fucking cares if he takes content from one sub and posts it to another sub?   You appear to be taking this awfully personal. Quite a few subs have banned him for blatant repostery so it's definitely an issue and not ""innocent cross-posting"" as you're implying."

The first time I experienced it, in the comment sections under Cracked articles, I was struck by how much the representives had in common with the conspiracy theorists and trolls that tend to clog the comments in political blogs, and started following. Watching a conspiracy develop in real time was captivating for me, and it being the first big one to develop in gaming circles was the icing on the cake. My background is in sociology, so  I was already the type of person who is interested in how groups form and evolve.  It's pretty much died down now though, I don't follow it as much.

SubredditDrama,3dekmo,Grandy12,70,Wed Jul 15 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Video games are new to this sort of criticism in general and a large portion of their fans just aren't accustomed to thinking critically about them at all. There are a large number of gamers who are very used to the whole thing being a big insular boys club designed to cater specifically to the sensibilities of edgy teenage boys, and now that the industry is slowly realizing how big it's gotten and how much broader it is than that single demographic they are completely thrown off by the fact that sometimes other tastes are being catered to, and other sensibilities considered.    This seems to have upset them so greatly that they are now convinced that everyone who isn't trying to keep the whole games industry all about them and what they want must be the enemy. To make things worse there were already several other conservative backlash movements going in close proximity with all the MRA/Redipill nonsense so it was fairly easy for these groups to support and learn from each other, and so naturally gamergate very quickly had a huge set of rhetoric to adopt about why it's awful that women should be involved in their videogames, which bleeds right into existing anti-feminism narratives.  The whole thing is quite the big stupid mess."
SubredditDrama,3dekmo,Murrabbit,13,Wed Jul 15 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'm basically the same, it was frustrating but fascinating to watch. Do you think it's really died down? Do you think they were a loud minority or are ""gamers"" still stuck?  Also in the same world of watching online communities develop, related to video games, I've had a ton of fun leaving Twitch Plays Pokemon on my list of subscribed subreddits. It started as a mass group of mild Pokemon fans making jokes about a weird nostalgic experiment, and has over the past year and a half transformed into an intensely tight knit community of insanely devoted Pokemon fans who continue to find new versions of Pokemon to collectively play, and are immensely dedicated to the lore they develop. Like, people make ANNOUNCEMENT posts when they decide to leave the community, it's nuts. Not my cup of tea anymore, but really fun to watch."
SubredditDrama,3dekmo,XelaO,30,Wed Jul 15 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it ever really penetrated gaming at large. Most gamers don't even use online forums, and Gamergate couldn't even lock down that portion of gamers. Game studios either ignore them or make jokes about them in their games. They're unwelcome at conventions and laughed at. Anecdotally, I've never encountered anyone who even seemed to know what I was referring to when joking about it in multiplayer games.  It's not going to go away entirely, but probably just the current core is eventually going to migrate to another nerd culture flashpoint and rebrand.  There's occasionally bursts of activity, but it's mostly just reassuring each other that GG is still going strong.  Gamerghazi barely covers GG anymore, and Twitter anti-GG is almost entirely devoted to personal drama. I think they've been a laughingstock too long and numbers have shrunk and/or they've become more insular."

I think a lot of people recognise this image, for example, and remember when a lot of the main sources for game journalism were essentially brought out by big publishers.   GG, however, only seemed to get interested and take an issue when the ethics in videogame journalism debate began to involve women and minorities. It's less about ethics in videogame journalism, and more about the ethics of the role of women and minorities in videogames and videogame journalism, and I think GG make their views on that debate quite clear."

But the ZQ drama fit in perfectly with how GG people percieve ""SJW"" tactics. It was a woman, who used her sexuality as leverage in a business relationship, in order to support her non-traditional game. That's basically persecuted neckbeard bingo right there. The ethics in Journalism bit only came after people looked at their outrage and said ""who cares what she did, if anything at all.""

Ironically, for a group of highly ethical, rigorous fact-checkers, they swallowed that hook, line, sinker, pole, and tackle-box, and they stick to it even after the OP recanted.  But it was always about being pissed off at women/minorities/other people.  They claimed that they were pissed that a game had gotten a favorable review, and that review was written by the guy that the developer was romantically involved with!!!!11!!  Except, it wasn't.  He didn't review her game, and he only wrote an article with her featured in it about a Gamejam months before their supposed dalliance.  But little things like ""facts"" could not deter them, so they continued to doxx her and threaten her life.   Then, someone wrote an article about how the gaming community has evolved, matured, and diversified, and that the notion of gamers as pasty, socially-inept, Cheeto-stained grubworms was largely a myth, and that games need to be written for diverse crowds, with an eye on the experiences and tastes of a wider audience, no longer beholden to whitebread dudebro stereotypes.  In a surprisingly (not really) heroic lack of basic reading comprehension, they took it as a declaration of hostilities by the minions of Social Justice, against which they must resist, as only heroic gamepatriots do!  At which point they literally and figuratively lay on the floor and proceeded to pound their feet whenever they felt slighted.  Which happened to be approximately every 9 seconds.

Although I'm kind of an easy going Daddy, I shower with both my kids, sometimes me, wife, son and daughter all at once! Daughter is just 2, but son is 5 now.  I use it as an opportunity to show him how to clean under his foreskin, ""can you give that winky a wash please mate, otherwise it'll get stinky!"" and it's just kinda more handy to be in there with them than to get your clothes all wet trying to help them from outside. We walk around naked quite often anyway, and don't really hide ourselves from the kids at all. I don't really like the idea of any kind of body shame being inadvertantly absorbed by them, so we just kinda act natural.  My son rocks around naked quite often too, even just on his own, but he has what must be a natural aversion to folks outside the family seeing him naked as he'll run upstairs and get dressed if anyone knocks the door or anything.  The only awkward shower experience we've had so far, was while showering with both kids a few months back, i was washing my face, all incapacitated and vulnerable with eyes closed a soapy face, and my daughter (2) decided to grab my dick.

Or, perhaps, just perhaps, sometimes we punish behavior that is itself morally reprehensible. I know, I know, this just gave someone an idea-boner to liken this to how homosexuality was once a crime.

No matter what side you're on (the ""fucking kill all those cockroaches"" side or the ""i believe they can be good as long as they don't act on it"" side) this is super interesting. To quote this piece from the NYT (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0): ""A pedophile should be held responsible for his conduct — but not for the underlying attraction. Arguing for the rights of scorned and misunderstood groups is never popular, particularly when they are associated with real harm. But the fact that pedophilia is so despised is precisely why our responses to it, in criminal justice and mental health, have been so inconsistent and counterproductive. Acknowledging that pedophiles have a mental disorder, and removing the obstacles to their coming forward and seeking help, is not only the right thing to do, but it would also advance efforts to protect children from harm."""

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,CuvisTheConqueror,36,Wed Jul 15 22:07:07 2015 UTC,I mean this in the most polite way: Fuck off.   I don't have anything to add.  I just wanted to highlight this magnificent line.
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,ANAL_CAVITIES,5,Wed Jul 15 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, broncosandwrestling (the mod who originally made the post) was telling Rev_Jim_Ignatowski (the guy who apparently has a problem with the bronies, or with there being a post about the bronies, or with the SquaredCircle community, or... something, probably everything) to fuck off.  He's on the pro-Brony side, or at least neutral, even if he is providing plenty of butter."

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,Statoke,10,Wed Jul 15 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"Okeydokeyday, here are some thoughts on MLP and MLP-hate (full disclosure, I consider myself a brony):  1) MLP is just a show. In that sense you are correct.  2) MLP fandom as an internet phenomenon began on 4chan because of course it did. It gained steam as a tolerance movement.  3) These days, MLP is mostly like a normal fandom. However, true to its 4chan roots, the MLP fandom often moves en-masse (as evidenced by the SquaredCircle drama).  As with any large group, there are sub-groups that are annoying and sub-groups that are less so. Some people got introduced to the annoying ones first, and have a bad opinion of the fandom in general because of it.  Anyway, here and here is some drama, though it is more recent. There is also plenty of within-fandom drama, such as this. But the biggest drama in MLP history is probably still Derpygate (a popular fandom-named character's name was changed because it was deemed offensive - it has since been changed back)."
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,VintageLydia,7,Thu Jul 16 02:19:15 2015 UTC,You seem to miss a big part: cloppers. I know most aren't into pony porn but that is a big reason for the hate.
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,ltg313,7,Thu Jul 16 01:49:54 2015 UTC,Especially the not well tagged easily searched pony porn Little Suzy comes across trying to find things about her favorite show.
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,SmilesTheEmo,3,Thu Jul 16 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"You missed the other major part of brony hate, which is how seriously ya'll take your show. The sheer magnitude of obsession which a not-insignificant portion of bronies display is unnerving. There's no adventure time convention."
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,Nerdlinger,4,Thu Jul 16 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think it started with a few of the more obsessive fans being annoying, and then blossomed into bandwagoning. It's just cool to hate them for it. I had a friend who was into it in highschool, and nobody really cared because he hardly even talked about it unless you asked him. He was just a normal guy in a rainbow dash jacket."

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,Belori77,19,Wed Jul 15 23:17:25 2015 UTC,Some people were really bothered by this. At least it got new people into wrestling

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,pandas795,9,Wed Jul 15 23:50:31 2015 UTC,I love the wrestling content on r/mylittlepony. The SC people's reactions to watching the show are great
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,sonnyforelli,-56,Thu Jul 16 00:30:07 2015 UTC,yeah whatever you got a bunch of pedophiles on your board now great job

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,pandas795,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"That /u/BorkTalk post got questionable for a split second, and righted itself pretty quick.  That aside, I think I'm remembering exactly what I love so much about pro-wrestling through this sub-swap and learning exactly what makes them love their fandom so much.   This is what the internet was born for."
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,ZeframCochrane-,17,Thu Jul 16 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"I'm taking part in this as an /r/squaredcircle subscriber going over to /r/mylittlepony.   I've been watching the show, and actively participating in posts in the sub.   I said this in a few posts there, I'll say it here too.   I've always said that I'd watch anything that someone wanted me to get into provided that they watch a few hours of wrestling in return. I'd never ever expected Bronies to step up to that particular plate, but, they did.   I felt it necesscary to join the sub-swap for this reason alone. After I made the jump I found a few more reasons.   1) First and foremost, THIS IS FUN!  2) Their user base consists of what I would generally describe as some of the friendliest people on Reddit.  3) Their user base, mixing with the user base of /r/squaredcircle has benefitted both fandoms immensely.  4) A lot of people in both fandoms are having a lot of fun with it.  5) Was anyone else aware that some of the bronies are insanely talented?  These are just stupid smarks complaining about possibly having to scroll an extra page or two to see the latest on what Dave Meltzer thinks about absolute bullshit or what Nakamura ate for breakfast."
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,Statoke,7,Thu Jul 16 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I don't get the ""brony"" hate. I bucking love MLP, but it's okay because Im a girl? They have some pretty epic references in every episode, like the Big Lebowski, Doctor Who and a ton more. The ponies are colleged aged aged and the animation is awesome. Also, like /u/ZeframCochrane- said, the userbase is so welcoming and friendly. I love the episode discussions, it doesn't even feel like the typical toxic reddit. /rant"

SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,bashella,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to take the swap as seriously as I can, so I haven't been browsing much of SC over the last 48 hours.   I knew there'd be a few people bringing the popcorn though."
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,ttumblrbots,4,Thu Jul 16 01:54:56 2015 UTC,Oh you're one of those people who hate Meltzer and anything not WWE.
SubredditDrama,3dfn5j,tehnod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I've got tons of love for NJPW, ROH, CZW, AAA, and Lucha Underground as well.   I think Meltzer's relevance is starting to fade."
