EarthPorn,3e1xz5,jhc1415,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Beautiful. I used to live in Moab, which is a couple miles down the road from Arches National Park.  There's a sort of urban legend (or rural legend, I guess) that the names for Delicate Arch and Landscape Arch were accidentally swapped, because if you look at the two arches it makes way more sense the other way around: Delicate arch has an amazing landscape behind it and Landscape arch looks extremely delicate. The story's false but I can see the logic behind it!"

EarthPorn,3e1xz5,jhc1415,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of the name swap with Landscape Arch but I agree that does make sense. I had always heard that the original names for Delicate Arch made reference to how it looks like a pair of pants, and according to at least one source the arch was called ""The Chaps"" and/or ""The Schoolmarm's Bloomers"" back before its current name was coined in the 30s.  I also remember once hearing that it used to be called ""The Trousers"" by an old park ranger (this was back in the early 90s) but I've never been able to find a source to back up that claim. More interesting, I think, would be the name(s) the local Native American tribes (Pueblo, Ute, Navajo, etc.) may have had for the site for the thousands of years they were there before any Europeans showed up."
EarthPorn,3e1xz5,Frencil,3,Tue Jul 21 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. One of the more awesome things about living in Utah were the ruins and cliff art dotted all over the area, especially the petroglyphs and pictographs that are high up on the canyon walls along the Colorado River.

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,Elios000,16,Mon Jul 20 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"L2 isn't that crazy when you remember that the important frame of reference is the sun.

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,GiantZebra43,4,Tue Jul 21 00:53:46 2015 UTC,None of this makes any sense.. Why would it work like that?
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,frankenham,12,Tue Jul 21 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"L-points are gravitationally unstable, so definitely not forever -- but even without stationkeeping it will drift relatively little over hundreds of years. Pretty amazing stuff."

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,lordkrike,10,Mon Jul 20 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are right, things in L1 do not last forever, but they do last long enough that any mission that we send there isn't likely to outlast their orbit."
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,gingersaurus82,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"You need to periodically adjust the orbit at these points. If you didn't need to, there would likely be much more stuff hanging around at those spots."
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,khajiitFTW,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:43 2015 UTC,So does that mean there is always a very tiny shadow of the satellite being cast on the Earth?   EDIT: Nevermind.. Sun is too big and sends light in more than one direction.

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,McDouchevorhang,7,Mon Jul 20 21:56:59 2015 UTC,So somewhere down there is a shadow from that thing (probably not noticeable)...
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,lordkrike,12,Mon Jul 20 22:45:59 2015 UTC,Not really.  The light is so diffused at that distance that the drop in illumination is probably not measurable without special equipment.  The umbra of that satellite probably isn't even a kilometer long.
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,MrLewayne,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:34 2015 UTC,If the satellite was orbiting the earth at L1 between the sun and the earth theoretically would it cast a shadow on to land? I can't imagine the people that would see it every day. I wonder if NASA has a formal complaint center.
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,Dantonn,11,Mon Jul 20 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"The probe is too small and too far away from Earth for its umbra (the full, proper shadow you probably have in mind where the object blocks all light) to reach the planet. The penumbra/antumbra will almost certainly be unnoticeable to anyone not using specialized equipment.  The wiki article on shadow types has some pretty decent diagrams if you're unfamiliar with the terms.  Edit: did some basic math (and someone more awake or less rusty please feel free to check) and I'm getting the umbra stretching out ~200m behind the probe, which is pretty much nothing compared to the ~1.5 million km it is from Earth."
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,One_Mikey,3,Mon Jul 20 23:08:04 2015 UTC,The light would be diffused through our atmosphere. The 'shadow' would not be noticeable.
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,jetRink,22,Mon Jul 20 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"More importantly, at that distance, the satellite is simply too small to completely block the sun and create a shadow on earth. This photo of the International Space Station will help to visualize that.  If you're standing in its ""shadow"" (technically a partial shadow), the sun will only be very slightly dimmer."
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,kanst,21,Mon Jul 20 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"To add context to your picture, the ISS is ~60 times wider than DSCOVR and DSCOVR is 3,600 times further away from earth."
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,docboz,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:24 2015 UTC,Really its as simple as a fruit fly on a light bulb
EarthPorn,3dyxd4,likeAgoss,12,Tue Jul 21 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"more importantly, the sun isn't a point-source, so the amount of light blocked by a 54""x72"" satellite placed 930,000 miles away is going to be negligible.     The sun has an angular diameter of about 30 minutes of arc when viewed from the earth,  but the DSCOVR only has an angular diameter of 1.2*10-9 minutes of arc.    Atmospheric diffusion doesn't count for much when it's only blocking something like one ten billionth of the light coming from the sun."

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,alexm42,5,Tue Jul 21 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"The Moon doesn't come between the Earth and the spacecraft every month because its orbit is slightly inclined, by roughly 5 degrees from Earth's orbit around the sun.

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,Lorneehax37,9,Tue Jul 21 01:57:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is about 5.5 s but just so people aren't confused by the math, the speed of light is 300 million m/s so only 300,000 km/s."

If seeing bits of the planet is enough for you you can watch:   Landsat 7 and 8 Aqua and Terra METOP 1 and 2 Starting from a few months, Sentinel-2 HDEV cameras aboard ISS   That's off the top of my bookmarks, but lots of other birds are nowadays sharing images on the open. Himawari-8 takes astounding images (WARNING: 160 Mb png) but I don't know where to find them or if they're available).  Algo, if instead od RGB you can you are interested in more exotic products (IR, radar imaginery, human lights at night) those are available too =)"

EarthPorn,3dyxd4,ZombieChief,9,Tue Jul 21 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"Neil deGrasse Tyson wrote some nice words today for this photo:   Dear Facebook Universe,  At the request of the White House, I offer reflections on the attached image of our home, released today, July 20, 2015, forty-six years to the day after the first bootprints were left on the Moon.    Earth. Not mounted on a stand, with color-coded state and national boundaries, as schoolroom globes are prone to display. Instead, we see our world as only a cosmic perspective can provide: Blue Oceans -- Dry Land -- White Clouds -- Polar Ice. A Sun-lit planet, teeming with life, framed in darkness.  In 1972, when NASA’s Apollo 17 astronauts first captured an entire hemisphere of our planet, we were treated to such a view. The Blue Marble, it was called. The Space Program’s unprecedented images of Earth compelled us all to think deeply about our dependence on nature and the fate of our civilization.  Of course, at the time, we had other distractions. Between 1968 and 1972, the United States would experience some of its most turbulent years in memory, simultaneously enduring a hot war in Southeast Asia, a Cold War with the Soviet Union, the Civil Rights Movement, campus unrest, and assassinations. Yet that’s precisely when we voyaged to the Moon, paused, looked back, and discovered Earth for the first time.  The year 1970 would celebrate the first Earth Day. In that same year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were formed with strong bipartisan support. In 1972, the pesticide DDT was banned and the Clean Water Act was passed. And one year later, the Endangered Species Act would be enacted, the catalytic converter would be introduced, and unleaded automotive emission standards would be set. A stunning admission that we’re all in this together, with a common future on a shared planet.  Regrettably, we still live in a turbulent world. But we now have at our disposal, not simply a photograph of our home to reflect upon, but continual data of our rotating planet, captured 13 times per day, by the robotic Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), a specially designed space camera & telescope, launched and positioned a million miles from Earth.  We will now be able to measure and track Sun-induced space weather as well as global climactic trends in ozone levels, aerosols, vegetation, volcanic ash, and Earth reflectivity, all in high resolution; just the kind of data our civilization needs to make informed cultural, political, and scientific decisions that affect our future. Occasions such as this offer renewed confidence that we may ultimately become responsible shepherds of our own fate, and the fate of that fragile home we call Earth.  Neil deGrasse Tyson  American Museum of Natural History, New York City"

EarthPorn,3dzkpr,c4rlito,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:33 2015 UTC,i'm guessing you were at a spot where you could set up camp for the night. I had some friends who got that same experience at Yosemite and were basking in the sunset when they realized they had no idea how they'd get down in the dark.  They eventually made their way down one step at a time with their very weak fliphones backlights (this was before the era of smartphones).
EarthPorn,3dzkpr,auffenauger,3,Mon Jul 20 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"Close! We were actually staying at a hotel just down the road.  This was taken at Glacier Point, so there are definitely campgrounds nearby."

EarthPorn,3dzkpr,UScossie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"Awesome shot man. I've been shooting for a while but I've just recently started shooting landscape and even more recently decided to really try, rather than just shooting pretty landscapes while I backpack. I shoot a D7000, so fairly comparable to your camera. If you don't mind me asking, do you use any filters or do much post processing? I find that with most of my shots I have to do quite a bit of editing, but landscape have such a wide dynamic range that I'm starting to just think that's the nature of landscape photography."
EarthPorn,3dzkpr,lukeoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for the kind words.  I'll sometimes use an ND filter/polarizing filter, but the ND filter effect can also be achieved in Lightroom now.  Censors are SUPER powerful currently, and you can really pull a lot of details out of an image even without filters(though ND/polarizes are staples for many landscape shooters).  As far as editing, I shoot in RAW, so you HAVE to edit the basics of blacks, whites, highlights, and shadows.  When shooting JPEG's, your camera is deciding those for you based on algorithms.  The artistry comes into how you personally interpret what you saw.  I stray away from really heavy editing, and prefer a natural look, but you'd be doing a disservice to your photos if you didn't clean them up a bit in LR."

I live in PA about 40 minutes from Ithaca and Cayuga has been my family's lake choice ever since I can remember. Just had the boat out on Sunday with the GF and some friends. It was a blast!

U street has been written about as having the best in the country.  Flash is newer, a bit smaller and arguably has an even better system than U hall.  They're in walking distance of each other.  Between them is the 9:30 club, always in the top 10 of places to see a show in the USA.  DC is a great place for live music."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,snapbackchinos,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:45 2015 UTC,The image was a combination of four 286-second exposures. 286 seconds is over four-and-a-half minutes.  Notice the grasses are blurry.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,zbufferz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:36 2015 UTC,Wow I totally misread the exposures. I think I skimmed and just saw 1/280.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Phayze87,5,Mon Jul 20 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"The reason he needs at least two exposures is because both the sky and the ground are in focus.  The sky is in focus because he used a star tracker (a thingy that moves the camera in sync with the rotation of the earth so the stars stay in focus).  But a star tracker would cause the ground to go blurry, so he needed a separate shot that had the ground focused (but which would have had a blurry sky.  He composites the at least two exposures together to keep the sharp sky and the sharp ground."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,kylem683,3,Mon Jul 20 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"Stunning photo, my lord. I recently embarked down the path of photography and astro/star-scapes have always been an interest of mine, but I am still so new I haven't been able to achieve anything even remotely this beautiful.  I'm running a crop sensor camera, my wide angle kit lens (18-55mm) starts like f4 or f5.6 or something. Do you need anything else besides a tripod and star tracker thing to get started with super long exposures like this? (PS: I'd love to see a pic of the camera attached to the star tracker cause I still have no idea how it works.)"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Phayze87,2,Mon Jul 20 11:36:10 2015 UTC,You may want to invest in a wider aperture lens. Being able to open up a lens to f2 or so will allow you to lower your iso and reduce the noise of your image.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ChrisLW,2,Mon Jul 20 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I recently got a 50mm prime @ 1.4, but as I mentioned in an above post I'm hesitant to use it due to the fact that I have a crop sensor so my 50mm because like a 75 or 80mm."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,MaxHannibal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but can give you a few pointers.  Most important will be to use something other than your 18-55 kit lens.  The focal length isn't bad, but you'll get better results with a faster lens.  The OP is using a Samyang/Rokinon manual focus lens with a fast (2.8) aperture.  By going with a manual focus, the lens doesn't cost nearly as much (and doing astrophotography, you don't need autofocus anyway.)  You could also see about renting a fast lens from a local camera store, and experimenting with 30 second or so exposures before dropping the coin on a dedicated lens and astro-mount (30 seconds with a short focal length being about the max you can pull off before the stars make trails in your photo).  That's what I did to nab this shot at Copper Breaks State Park in Texas earlier this year.  I'll likely try again later this summer to get some shots of the Milky Way, like the OP did.  Good luck!"

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Andy1_1,5,Mon Jul 20 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"You have to if you're a fan. I've seen them at festivals, clubs and they even did a live set on KCRW. Every show was spot on perfect and most of what you hear on the album is performed live — percussion, brass, vocalists, fucking sitars. In my opinion THAT is how you play 'electronic' live. You don't want to miss the opportunity if you have a chance to go."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,f1del1us,9,Mon Jul 20 03:03:53 2015 UTC,Fantastic. What is star tracker?
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ObecalpEffect,29,Mon Jul 20 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"A star tracker is a device that (very slowly) turns your camera to match the rotation of the earth so that you don't get star trails when taking extremely long exposures.  Normally you'd be limited to 20-30 seconds of exposure before star trailing appears (that's a loose generalization, the max time is actually based on your focal length, see the Rule of 500 )."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ObecalpEffect,7,Mon Jul 20 03:25:15 2015 UTC,Does it have to be precisely calibrated based on your location?
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,lil-rap,12,Mon Jul 20 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. For an Equatorial mount like the one I use, there is a scope that needs to be aligned with Polaris (or in the Southern hemishpere, Sigma Octantis).   There are also mounts that actually measure and follow the movement of night-sky objects using a sensor, but those are generally bigger, heavier, and much more expensive."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,redhedhempgal,6,Mon Jul 20 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to wrap my head around how the camera is rotating with the stars, so they don't streak, but why then aren't the trees blurred?  Did you take some static shots of just the trees and then merge them with the star shots?  Did you light the trees some how?  They look quite nice."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,46,Mon Jul 20 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you've got it exactly right.  I take the same shot with the tracker on and off, no other settings are changed, then I combine them in post.  Here's an example of what that looks like from a previous shoot:  http://i.imgur.com/J6j1yLg.jpg"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,ParadiseForParasites,5,Mon Jul 20 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Just out of curiosity, and sorry if you mentioned it already, which star tracker are you using?  Is it something like this?  http://www.firstlightoptics.com/blog/vixen-polarie-star-tracker-mount-review.html"
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,8,Mon Jul 20 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"I have an iOptron, but it's almost exactly like that Vixen Polarie (and a little bit cheaper I believe)."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,midnightsmith,7,Mon Jul 20 04:46:59 2015 UTC,"I also have the iOptron and love it, but I have yet to do any composite images with it.

Shameless plug, here is my website: www.nicholaslindsey.zenfolio.com"

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,your_message_here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:04 2015 UTC,Very nice examples! So do you cut out the stars and overlay on the non blurry trees and such? If so that seems like a long process considering all the small details of trees and bushes you have to work around. Do you use a vector mask of some sort? Kinda mid level photoshop skills here and would love to experiment.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,coding_is_fun,4,Mon Jul 20 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"You could easily use a layer mask to paint over the blurred areas from one picture or use the pen tool to do the same thing essentially, if that makes sense."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,skeptical_views,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well that depends who you talk to, historians can't even seem to agree.   In her article “Reclaiming the word ‘Squaw’ in the Name of the Ancestors,” Dr. Bruchac wrote the following excerpt about the meaning of squaw.  “The word has been interpreted by modern activists as a slanderous assault against Native American women. But traditional Algonkian speakers, in both Indian and English, still say words like ‘nidobaskwa’=a female friend, ‘manigebeskwa’=woman of the woods, or ‘Squaw Sachem’=female chief. When Abenaki people sing the Birth Song, they address ‘nuncksquassis’=‘little woman baby’.”  “I understand the concern of Indian women who feel insulted by this word, but I respectfully suggest that we reclaim our language rather than let it be taken over,” wrote Bruchac."

EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Jowitness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:37 2015 UTC,I know nothing about photography so bear with me. Why do the hills and trees appear to be illuminated by something as bright as the sun but the night sky looks so radiant? I can't wrap my head around it.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,-Zuko-,4,Mon Jul 20 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize.  It's not a natural phenomenon, although similar can be achieved when there is a very small sliver of a moon (which is actually what I was hoping to get, but my timing was off by a few days. TONIGHT would be a good night to do the same with the moon before it sets around 10:40). In this case, the hill is illuminated by ""light pollution"" from the concert and whatnot going on a half mile down the hill behind the camera."
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Oldenough33,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:32 2015 UTC,That's interesting. It makes the picture look amazing.
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,DogeMcDogeyDoge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:01 2015 UTC,i tried shooting my first night sky photography when i was camping. i completely failed and i didn't see any stars in my photos. :(
EarthPorn,3dwcvf,Rob_63,3,Mon Jul 20 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"I shot my second photo last night in a light polluted area and it came out fantastic! Here are some tips from what I have learnt:  Make sure it is a clear dark night (around midnight is good) and you can see a few stars with the naked eye. Try to avoid shooting if there is a full moon as this will cause light pollution. Either use a tripod if you have one, or just find a flat stable surface to lay your camera on (facing up). Set camera to use a 2 sec timer (so camera doesn't shake when it opens the shutter) Set image format to RAW (if you can for the most detail).  Zoom in and point towards the brightest star you can see, manually focus the camera on this star. Start with a low ISO (100-400) and try a shutter speed of 10-15 seconds. You can get away with higher exposures without a tracking mount but it depends on your focal length. I usually stick to 10-20 seconds or you start to see star trails. You normally want your aperture as high as you can get it so your lens takes in the most light (my lens only goes to f3.5). Point the camera at the sky and take a test photo.  Check your results, can you see any more stars? Are they sharp? Is the sky still dark enough? (not too important but you don't want a really pale blue or you won't see anything either.  Now just play with your shutter speed, ISO and focus until you get a decent shot with sharp stars. This is do-able in light polluted areas.  I took this last night (it was stacked in deep sky stacker to make it more detailed though!).  http://postimg.org/image/tzjed0bdh/ 10 x 13 sec exposures, 800 ISO, f3.5."
