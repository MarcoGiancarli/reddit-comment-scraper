progresspics,3e0027,Bethanym9884,24,Mon Jul 20 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"Although I know I'll need one in order to lose the next 10lbs, I don't have much of a routine right now. I limit my portion sizes, eat out less often than I used to, and maintain awareness of what and how much I eat. I haven't put much effort into counting calories. I tried to maintain a food and workout journal at the beginning but it was a lot of work and usually left me feeling discouraged if I didn't reach my goals for the week. I run about three miles per day now but it took a long time to get into it. What really helped me lose weight was staying focused on how my new habits made me feel better and reminding myself that I was committing to a new lifestyle rather than making temporary changes.  I started trying to lose weight around September of last year when I decided that I wanted a dog. I planned to walk twice a day for at least a mile as practice for the puppy's arrival in December. Walking everywhere made me realize how out of shape I was, so I pushed myself to jog off and on during my walks until it hurt. After a while, I noticed that jogging wasn't actually painful. I started being able to differentiate between being in real pain and being uncomfortable. I have always had a problem overeating. The discomfort I felt from eating too much just wasn't worth it when I realized that it was comparable to intense exercise. What definitely was painful was the acid reflux I used to have at night before I started eating right and exercising. I almost cried when I noticed that I hadn't had a single night of sleep lost due to stomach pain since January.  Despite hating it intensely when I first started losing weight, I've really grown to love running. I hope my dog will eventually feel the same way, but he is way lazier than I anticipated. He's nine months now, just over 100 lbs, and would much prefer being carried like a sack of potatoes to walking any distance in the Florida heat. It really is amazing how much stronger and healthier I've become in the past year, and /r/progresspics has played a major role in inspiring me to stay on track and keep pushing forward. I didn't think I was going to post my pictures (hence the horrible ""before"" pics) but I really felt like I owed it to the community in case someone else needed some encouragement. Remember to stay positive even when you experience setbacks and if anybody needs an accountability partner for their workouts, feel free to PM me."

You carry a 100lb dog in the Florida heat & humidity?  Damn, that's determination.  I thought I was some kind of hero when I carried my 30lb sick dog for a few hundred yards.  I envy you -- I can't stand heat & humidity.  I break out in heat prickles when it's warm and humid so I don't leave the house much during the summer."
progresspics,3e0027,skinnybully,3,Tue Jul 21 13:10:40 2015 UTC,I stopped trying to carry him when he hit 50lbs. Now he gets one early morning and one late night walk. I run while he's napping in the afternoon when it's the most miserable outside.

I got to 180 and stayed there, but after a few years and a sedentary job I krept up to close to 200lbs, and had to switch gears.  Now I swim 4000yds/3700m Tues/Thursday/Saturday and I run 4 miles Mon/Tues/Wed.  I calorie count for a few weeks here and there to be aware of what I consume.  I aim for 200-300cal bfast 400-600 cal lunch 200 cal snack and 800 cal dinner.  Swimming days are heavier, running days are lighter.   Finding an online fitness community helped me a lot.  So did joining a swim team where I made friends to work out with.  If anyone needs any advice for kicking snacking, cooking healthier, or swimming hit me up."

I've been stuck here for a few months now and while I continually feel healthier,  I'm not losing anymore weight.  I'm about an inch shorter than you so I'm thinking around 175 would be a healthy weight for me.  Any tips?"
progresspics,3e2sk1,Fakesighs,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"I see that you've successfully ran keto (congrats!) What does your daily intake and expenditures look like? What has really helped me is measurements--Take them down down, and stuff them away for later. (Neck, calves, thighs, waist, forearms, etc etc, just make sure you look up how to properly measure so you don't doubt the progression later.) Sometimes when I'm feeling down that my scale hasn't budged, I check out my measurements and I'm pleasantly surprised! When I say 'getting serious-ish' it's because my boyfriend and I love to cook yummy recipes and eat out, and sometimes cheat meals turn into cheat days, or I completely stop counting my calories for a few days, but nothing crazy like 3000+ calories. Getting serious was also meeting my boyfriend in April last year at 208 lbs being happy for the first time in YEARS, and deciding I wanted to be the best man, emotionally and physically, for him and myself. (boy, it's hard to diet and date at the same time) X-X"

progresspics,3e259e,2wolves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:51 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you're doing resistance training as you try to lose those extra 5 lbs of fat.  You are now in the territory where you have a good chance of losing mostly muscle if you don't.  At your age and apparent fitness level, you should be able to still make muscle gains with a slight deficit.  I know because I've been close to where you are now and have done it.  And I'm considerably older than you.  Good luck!"

progresspics,3e13s1,Chraphie,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:06 2015 UTC,Hey man Thanks. My exercise is tailored to my diet. Im currently working with a lean body building coach who i will see once a month so he can adapt my plan for me. but for exercise i work out every part of my body once with 3 sets of ten to 15 reps. i always start with 3 sets of as many push-ups as i can do. and end with crunches and swimmers. At the end b4 the crunches i do 5 sets of 15-20 squats then when im done i do a 30 min walk. the diet is amazing. i eat alot of food. i am building my metabolizm. no dairy and light on sugar but as long as it fits my plan i can have it. im really hoping to take this all the way. Good luck to you!

progresspics,3dyzmi,runningsober,7,Mon Jul 20 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"Meh it's all good. I've always said if I wasn't afraid of the sides like gyno and hair loss, I would be on gear for sure - the results are fantastic and supplemented with hard work, just make for the body I would have really loved to have had (a similar 2-215lbs weight, far lower bodyfat). Right now, to get really 'beach ready' in my eyes, requires a caloric intake that is difficult to maintain over the long-term. I'm more just focused on long-term health, a good body image for my soon to be born child, and staying active."
progresspics,3dyzmi,runningsober,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for specifying the gear-status. Some of us who aren't willing to take it personally, even though we couldn't care less if others do, like to know what is reasonably achievable natty. When I saw your pics, literally the first thing I thought was ""goddam it, I can't tell if he's juicing or not, but I want to look like that."" Thanks for letting me know what's possible. Perhaps in another 12 months I'll be able to post my own progress pics, and I'll be using you as a benchmark, since we are the same height and age."
progresspics,3dyzmi,Amerikaner83,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, after this amount of time you can achieve more I reckon.

progresspics,3dyzmi,DuckFan83,3,Mon Jul 20 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"SOrry, macros on a cut currently (while eating via IF simply for convenience and satiety) are no more then 2k cals, no less then 1500; Protein around .7-1g/lb goal bodyweight; the rest is whatever. It works out to 1 big meat portion at dinner (chicken/turkey/beef whatever) and the rest filled in with support meals (eggs and toast; protein smoothie; oatmeal bowl, whatever I'm hungry for). Lifting are 5 day bro splits chest/arms/back/shoulders/legs, running every other day trying to get my cardio endurance up. Sorry for generalizing, I do track my cals, but have been doing so for such a long time I literally do so in my head now."
progresspics,3dyzmi,DuckFan83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:47 2015 UTC,"Cheers. There's definitely plenty of % bodyfat to lose, so I would say far more then realistic as it can look a whole lot better (and I also hope will, in 3-4 weeks time). I just am in a comfortable place right now where I bust balls on a cut if I want to look leaner...ease up usually over winter and just manage calories far more lazily, then repeat.  edit - people on gear look awesome a ton of the time, definitely not taking anything from them. I just felt so decieved when I first started out, wanting to look a certain way aka Men's Fitness magazine covers, only to realize I wasn't getting outworked, but that it was due to usage. I don't think anyone should get defensive if they do use it - in fact, they are more comitted to the sport/hobby/lifestyle then others - it just sucked a bit to know it wasn't getting outworked in the gym, just outsmarted with the science."
progresspics,3dyzmi,ttip,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, I feel the exact same way. A lot of guys achieve really fantastic physiques with steroids, and there's no shame in that at all.  I just don't like that people will claim natural when they're obviously not, as that skews the perception for everyone else. Most girls have no idea that the guys they're drooling over in movies have bodies that aren't actually achievable naturally, and, like you said, it leads to a lot of disappointed guys who think they must be doing something wrong because they're not suddenly turning into Chris Evans, even after busting their ass for months or years at the gym."
progresspics,3dyzmi,pure_ego,0,Mon Jul 20 21:27:06 2015 UTC,4.5 years is a realistic timescale for such a transformation. It's only when idiots post similar transformations achieved in < 6 months then try and claim it because of their chicken and broccoli diet and 50-bicep curls a-day workout that my blood begins to boil.  Fantastic achievement buddy. Well done! An inspiration for many.

I still have no clue how I wasn't morbidly obese.   And I guess my genetics are pretty good. I get a lot of vascularity from my mom. Even before lifting I still had decent chest veins.

I feel like a fraud sometimes when people talk about how hard I've worked and and how much dedication I must have; because once I mentally chose this path... eating the bread or the cupcake was never an option or a temptation.

progresspics,3dvkdz,BloodyWraps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.  I really appreciate the kind words! Well, basically every day consists of a variation of the following 3-4 days a week: I warm up on the bike for 5 minutes (learned the hard way to do that) Stretch thoroughly for ~10 Minutes. 20 minutes high intensity on the ARC Trainer (similar to a elliptical but kicks my ass more) Then I jump into a weight routine.  I hit every muscle group for every workout.  Nursing school doesn't allow much else. I pick a focus, such as shoulders and I'll still do all my usual lifts, but I will add about 2-3 exercises for that focus area for the day.  I never completely skip a group.  Most my lifts are 2x5 or 2x10.  I use a mixture of free weights and machines to accomplish this.  And then I just eat 1500 calories a day with about 140g of protein being part of that.  Almost 0 junk food/fast food.  And endless amounts of water every single day.  Sorry for the messy format.  I am more than happy to answer something I missed.  Not used to losing weight yet haha."

progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,7,Sun Jul 19 04:46:27 2015 UTC,I went from 218lbs to 162lbs the first 3 months. After that i readjusted my macros and and started cardio only twice weekly. Also had to reduce my caloric intake because i had lost weight and my TDEE had reduced.
progresspics,3dsm23,darknecross,5,Sun Jul 19 04:48:55 2015 UTC,56 lbs in 3 months!!!! Damn!!!
progresspics,3dsm23,Spaghetti-hoes,3,Sun Jul 19 07:08:29 2015 UTC,that's a 200000 calorie deficit in 3 months...which is a 2200 deficit per day...
progresspics,3dsm23,darknecross,6,Sun Jul 19 14:50:59 2015 UTC,How many calories do you think running literally 3.2 miles a day burns? Now add a caloric deficit? Now add that he was 218 and his body had a shit ton of fat reserves to get rid of? Yup.
progresspics,3dsm23,Spaghetti-hoes,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:14:43 2015 UTC,Go read up on crash dieting. There's a point where deficits hinder weight loss.
progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,4,Sun Jul 19 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"Not really. All deficits eventually slow down your metabolism. The idea of crash dieting is to get it over with, ideally before your metabolism takes a hit. Then you just have to slowly raise your intake after you're done so you don't gain weight back."
progresspics,3dsm23,Jerzup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:16:38 2015 UTC,No dude. It spikes your stress hormones and tanks your weight loss.
progresspics,3dsm23,Ebonyks,3,Sun Jul 19 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"You can't gain nor maintain weight on a large caloric deficit. Say, for someone like me, who's TDEE is around 3,500 calories, eating 2,000 a day will definitely make me lose weight. Fast, too. So, instead of taking 5 weeks to lose just 5 pounds on a 500 calorie deficit, I could lose 5 pounds in less than two weeks at a 1500 calorie deficit. Which just happened, because I got food poisoning. I lost 5 pounds (some from water weight) in about 4 days."
progresspics,3dsm23,Funk9K,0,Mon Jul 20 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually got into an argument over someone else a few days ago because I brought up metabolic damage and crash dieting, he said that it doesn't exist and I argued it very obviously did when someone 215 was eating 1800 and wasn't in a deficit anymore."
progresspics,3dsm23,thankyouforfu,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:57 2015 UTC,That's crazy. He probably only ate 2000 calories a day. I train twice a day and I only burn around 4500 calories

I've done almost the same on keto (55 pounds down since Jan. 1).  Do your insecurities want to accuse me of being on gear, too?  Add to that the ""after"" pics are taken with very favorable lighting, and I don't see how anybody with any knowledge of the subject would have the knee-jerk reflex you did of accusing him of using gear.  There are some submissions in this sub that are clearly on some sort of PEDs.  This is far from one of them."

I started off barely reaching the 30 minute mark (which is average I think) and it took me 5 months (20 weeks) to lower my best 5k to 25 minutes.

progresspics,3dsm23,LTUTD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:16:49 2015 UTC,"Well, if you've never moved or done anything fitness/sports related including running/biking/rowing/lifting etc. I'd also say it's highly doubtful you can even run 5km, especially at that size.  Your body develops itself to sustain what it needs to, not what you want it to be able to. That means you have to run in order to actually build your body to be capable of running further etc. If he had truly never done anything fitness related AT ALL EVER, I'd also say even being able to run 5km is doubtful.  I don't think he's on gear, I just think he has put in a lot of effort before his ""before"" pics in January, to gain muscle size (he clearly has in his before pics) and overall decent fitness.  edit: 5min/km is a pretty decent pace. Not fast not slow, but definitely still not something someone with no previous training whatsoever could ever do."

progresspics,3dsm23,ShareHappyness,4,Sun Jul 19 05:14:54 2015 UTC,is the top right picture the same as your bottom two? you still got some loose skin around your chest/ab area?
progresspics,3dsm23,sojtucker,5,Sun Jul 19 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"The top right picture was about 4 months ago. The bottom pics were about 6 hours ago. Skin has tightened up really well. Exfoliation and moisturized daily and 10,000mcg of biotin every morning."
progresspics,3dsm23,TarAldarion,4,Sun Jul 19 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"Hey mind if I ask a question since you look so great.  Did you have some fat left over before you put on the muscle or did you reach you goal weight then muscle? Can you tell me the brands of the moisturizer or the biotin? I am contemplating on going on a clean bulk or continuing to eat below maintenance, even after 100lbs I still have a wobbly stomach :("
progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,3,Sun Jul 19 08:50:32 2015 UTC,I have only lost muscle so far. Everything was just under the fat. Any lotion is good. I use whatever is layin around. Its just important to exfoliate daily.

progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,7,Sun Jul 19 14:41:02 2015 UTC,What was your workout regime?
progresspics,3dsm23,Drayzen,11,Sun Jul 19 04:18:17 2015 UTC,The first 3 months i focused on carb cycling and morning cardio. 5k a day for 90 days. It was super challenging but very rewarding.
progresspics,3dsm23,TarAldarion,11,Sun Jul 19 04:41:31 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate more on this? Maybe give me a plan I can follow? I want to do exactly what you did. We basically have the same stats.
progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,9,Sun Jul 19 05:00:58 2015 UTC,Thats really all there was to it. I woke up and would run a 5k and make sure it was under 25 minutes. For the rest of the day i followed iifym and ate at a 20% caloric deficit of my TDEE.
progresspics,3dsm23,point1edu,17,Sun Jul 19 05:06:42 2015 UTC,Woah 5k in under 25 minutes at 218 lbs?  Did you run in high school or something?
progresspics,3dsm23,Drayzen,7,Sun Jul 19 08:31:59 2015 UTC,I would have to be in pretty great shape just to hit 25 minutes.... I hate running.
progresspics,3dsm23,TarAldarion,3,Sun Jul 19 09:16:17 2015 UTC,Yea I'm calling bullshit on that time
progresspics,3dsm23,dr_naive,9,Sun Jul 19 12:47:52 2015 UTC,"That's only 3 miles. so 8 minutes a mile isn't that ""bullshit"" if you push yourself."
progresspics,3dsm23,Drayzen,4,Sun Jul 19 13:03:22 2015 UTC,Yeah it'd be difficult for the first week or two but 8 minute miles are pretty easy to obtain.  edit: typo
progresspics,3dsm23,ColonelSlur,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"Running 1 mile in 8 mins ain't hard. However, running 3 miles in 25 mins is quite hard since you're getting progressively tired as you keep going. That means his first mile was like 6, 2nd was like 8, third was 10. And this is when he was at an obese weight of 218."
progresspics,3dsm23,Drayzen,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I grudgingly ran cross country in HS and was never in great shape. I attended a small school where if you played basketball, they made you pick up an early fall sport...which was CC for me. I was 6'2, 200 at the time(oh how I miss that) and would consistently hit 22:00 to 24:00 for a 5K...and I was the slow guy on the team.   I can see him easily hitting under 25 minutes at 24 years old if his cardio is strong."

This kid still had to eat right, all of the time. He clearly exercised religiously. Two things I'm willing to bet 99 percent of you throwing around accusations struggle with immensely. Steroids are not cheat codes, you still have to put in very hard work. With all of that said YOU DONT EVEN KNOW IF HE DID STERIODS OR NOT but this is reddit afterall so you're gonna have Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil, and the whole fuckin gang coming in here thinking they know shit just to rain on this kids parade who obviously whether you want to accuse of using steroids or not, worked very hard to get where he is today and only wanted to share and inspire (some of) the sad individuals of this thread.

progresspics,3dsm23,_Ashes_,6,Sun Jul 19 16:48:53 2015 UTC,Did you even read?  I did the math for the 60+ pounds.  2.5 pounds per week is totally doable naturally.  5k is 3.1 miles.  25/3.1 is a hair over 8 minutes per mile.  The mindset that considers an 8-minute mile impressive is kind of pathetic.  That's barely over jogging speed.  Though it makes sense.  It's the same kind of mindset that thinks an 8-minute mile is impressive that would have the knee-jerk reaction to accuse OP of using gear to achieve his progress in the last six months.

I got a fitbit which has helped immensely with keeping me active and honest with my caloric intake.  My main source of exercise has been running.

That said if I can pull together the will to take control of that aspect of my life I truly believe anyone can. You can do it friend. We let our wrought define who we are to the point we forget ourselves. It's amazing trying to pick up the pieces we've forgotten and relearn what we're capable of. You can do it.

progresspics,3dstie,funchords,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:35:27 2015 UTC,It's an illusion. It looks tight when standing. Buy if you have me bend over the loose skin around my stomach just flops down. Stomach and butt are my two problem areas with that. I got lucky in that my arms stayed fine.

progresspics,3dqeb0,just_secondhand_news,9,Sat Jul 18 17:35:42 2015 UTC,Weighing less and having loose skin is still more attractive than being overweight.
progresspics,3dqeb0,Scarbane,4,Sat Jul 18 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Like the other person said, the drawbacks of loose skin pale in comparison to the benefits of the weight loss itself.

progresspics,3dqeb0,hyperkeys,5,Sat Jul 18 19:51:50 2015 UTC,"wow did not expect this all i can say is THANKYOU!   You guys ave just motivated me so much   How i started, well basically it taken something really embarrassing for me to start this journey and that thing was on holiday to spain. i went to go on a roller coaster...and i couldn't fit in the seat ( The top pictures are from that holiday) Anyway they the people who work there where not subtle about telling me that they announced it over the the speakers and let me tell you when you have to walk past a line full of people laughing at what the guy over the speaker said that shit is SOUL CRUSHING.   I was in bits all day about it ruined my holiday (haven't been on a holiday since that one) but they day after i said to myself when i get back off this holiday am going to get myself in shape.   It started with research read up on everything you can listen to everyone then decide how you will go about it. Like i decided to diet for 2 months figure it out find out what food works for me ect, then i watched an advert for insanity (when you have zero self esteem stepping into a gym in one of the hardest things you can do) so i went down the road of doing it in the front room of my house when no body was in or awake because i was embarrassed to let people see me workout.  So i got insanity.... and i HATED MYSELF for torturing myself like this lol. no just kidding a little bit, i decided it was too hard to do everyday so how i did it was do insanity, day of rest, insanity, day of rest and so on until i started being able to move properly.  The day came where i choose to just do it properly so hit it hard do the whole 60 days without any rest and let me tell you i was worn out, i was broken, but i was happy, for the first time i felt like i done something in my life worth doing when you finish day 60 and look at your before and after pictures nothing beats that feeling.   after the 2 months dieting and the insanity  i was about 70 pounds down started getting more confidence. So the next stage was to find a gym was looking for a gym and found out a gym was opening around the corner from me and it was cheap and 24/7 (Pure gym in the uk)  joined the gym the day it opened i dragged my uncle down to it.   Right my uncle is a monster am talking 6""6 260 pounds of muscle he shown me the ropes when it came to weight training. for the first month had me on a full body routine of just compound movements making sure form is perfect just to make sure am not hurting myself.    So in the gym i went 3 times a week  did a full body routine starting with 3 sets of squats for 8 reps only 60kg, then barbell bench press 40kg again 3 sets for 8, dead lift now my uncle wouldn't let me do more than the bar until my form was spot on because you can snap your shit up doing dead lifts, then i went on to do barbell shoulder press  just the barbell  again 3 sets of 8.  thats was it for the first month and man was i in pin i was using muscles i never used before but i felt good. SO YEAH that basically how i got started if you guys want i can give you full details in like a video would be easer to talk then to right.. just let me know   AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH   P.S Sorry about the bad grammar and spelling and punctuation"

progresspics,3dshe0,Ray_adverb12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:09 2015 UTC,Thank you! I went from ZERO physical activity to at least ~50 crunches a day
progresspics,3dshe0,eknoteri,3,Sun Jul 19 03:51:44 2015 UTC,Is that the only working out you're doing? Keep in mind there are much better core workouts that will give you ab definition at a lower body fat % than crunches (which are actually pretty bad for your back).
progresspics,3dshe0,Crash_Gordon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"No, just the absolute base. I've been doing an hour on the elliptical and a bit of weights and squats, but suggestions are very welcomed!"
progresspics,3dshe0,enoons,4,Sun Jul 19 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"Oh great! Whatever gets you moving is generally considered the best workout :)  I only bring up crunches because they are discouraged as a core exercise in general because of the repetitive back flexion, which can cause herniation and disk bulge. Additionally, they're just not the most effective workout for abs.   Some ""better"" exercises for ab/core strength are plank variations, heavy squats, bird dogs, bicycles, supermans, push-ups on a stability ball.  This thread is also pretty informative though it's written by a layman."

progresspics,3dnsbv,Fancy_Pantsu,17,Sat Jul 18 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"The elliptical was my best friend. Low impact, and I could watch netflix or read while working out. The main thing with the diet was eating fewer calories. I tried to eat filling foods like vegetables so I could stay full and keep my caloric intake down.  I kept track of my lean mass as well, mainly checking BF% ahead of weight loss (BMI). I made sure I wasn't losing muscle along the way.  Something that may surprise you is that over the course of the last year I only had a workout partner for 5-10 workouts. The funny part is that people would ask ""How did you do it?"" and I told them the one thing they didn't want to hear. Eat Less, Exercise More.  You have to stay self motivated, you have to want it and know you can achieve it.  Beyond that, I never want my future children to be ridiculed the way that I was as a kid."

I feel you on that one, dude.  I started working out last September and it wasn't until April that I even managed to find a friend who was willing to go along with me.  Nothing opened my eyes up to that whole ""inactive society"" thing more than having to go to the gym by myself consistently and try to stay motivated.  (Congrats for managing the same!)"

progresspics,3ds5oz,cecilricky,8,Sat Jul 18 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Time. Your skin will take the same amount of time to snap back whether you lose the weight slowly or quickly. If it's going to take 2 years to tighten up as much as possible, then if you lost the weight in 1 month, it's going to look loose for 23 months, if you lost the weight in 18 months it would only look loose for 6. That's just an example, nobody knows how long your skin will take.  The biggest factors are ensuring that you lose enough body fat that there isn't any to weigh down the skin any more (excess skin is no thicker than the skin on the back of your hand - any more is fat), and time.  Most surgeries for skin removal are completely unnecessary. A family friend is a plastic surgeon and he says you should wait a minimum of 2 years maintaining at your lowest weight before even considering surgery. Your skin can change a lot in that time."

progresspics,3do2uc,Pineapple_Ninja,6,Fri Jul 17 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"For the first month, I focused solely on diet and making sure I could hit my target calories and macros using MyFitnessPal. Then I started doing StrongLifts 5x5, basically doing a full body workout three times a week. After that, I just continued lifting and eating at a deficit for a few months. Then I added in cardio (tennis, running, basketball) maybe 2 to 3 times a week. After stalling at 180 lbs for a month, I jumped on the keto train, which helped me lose the last 7 lbs. If you're stalling either increase activity or decrease calories. Eventually you'll break through, just don't give up."

progresspics,3do8rv,didntyouhearimadeer,7,Sat Jul 18 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"thank you. when I was really working to lose the weight, I ate 1200, did cardio 45 minutes to an hour 4 or 5 times a week (I ate back calories burned) and tried to weight train 2-3x a week (but I struggle with this because I do not enjoy lifting).

progresspics,3do8rv,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"I fluctuate between 115-120 pounds. 114 is pretty low for me so that weight would be very hard to maintain. Sometimes it goes up too much for my liking, and then I just spend the next few weeks being extra careful, eating a lot of salad and lean protein, maybe doing extra cardio. I have a really hectic job most of the year, so I don't get a lot of time to eat honestly. If I had more time on my hands I would probably gain more weight back."

progresspics,3dl4wh,crunchymango,100,Fri Jul 17 04:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'2. I started with Weight Watchers. Just the app, no group meetings. It helped me reestablish a basic sense of normal food portions and hunger cues. After about 2 months of WW, i switched over to counting my macros on My Fitness Pal. Now, it wasn't just about eating less, it was also making sure I hit daily protein/carb/fat targets. I also started hitting the gym. I'd go 4-5 days/week for 1 hour to either lift weights or do cardio (sprints on the treadmill, spinning, or Zumba classes :). It took me about 7 months to lose 50lbs."
progresspics,3dl4wh,Decembermouse,16,Fri Jul 17 09:45:45 2015 UTC,"What were/are your macros? You look incredible, by the way."
progresspics,3dl4wh,Blazingcrono,25,Fri Jul 17 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! :)  I do 40% carb/35% protein/25% fat. For me, this translates into a daily target of 130g carb, 113g protein, and 36g fat."
progresspics,3dl4wh,Decembermouse,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:20 2015 UTC,Only 1300 calories a day? That takes some discipline.
progresspics,3dl4wh,drayzie,45,Fri Jul 17 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Remember, I'm a 5'2 female. I'm a little thing lol. I can assure you I'm not walking around hungry. I'll also have a cheat day every 2 weeks when I don't track macros and eat whatever I'm craving.  I may reverse diet during the fall/winter and see if I can maintain on slightly increased calories."
progresspics,3dl4wh,aweezy,4,Fri Jul 17 15:12:52 2015 UTC,Go you! I keep succumbing to the cheat days and it's definitely hurting me :(  You look great though! Are you willing to disclose the weight from before and after?
progresspics,3dl4wh,solace_v,19,Fri Jul 17 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I went from 175 to 125.  Cravings and appetite control was, hands down, my biggest hurdle starting out. I highly recommend Weight Watchers. You ""budget"" your points to your liking in order to feel satiated. I was 175lbs, on a caloric deficit, and never felt hungry. It ""rebooted"" my system, changed my relationship with food, and allowed me to cross over to the (more rigorous, IMO) macro counting plan."
progresspics,3dl4wh,IamTheShark,2,Fri Jul 17 16:08:23 2015 UTC,Yeah me being a 185 pound guy definitely skews my perception of what's enough food. I'm trying to shoot for 1700 per day and it's really difficult.

progresspics,3dl4wh,anthronerd2016,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I never dedicated a day to working out abs, and I honestly didn't do many crunches or typical ab exercises. Any ab work was a byproduct of keeping a tight core and proper posture while lifting.  Out of the 4-5 days/week I went to the gym, 3 days included cardio (two days were 20 minutes of HITT, like sprints on the treadmill, and one day was an hour-long class like spinning)."

progresspics,3dl4wh,aZombieSlayer,3,Fri Jul 17 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't train abs specifically.  I did a 4-day lifting split, alternating lower and upper body:    Legs & butt Back & biceps Chest, shoulders, triceps Butt & calves   20 minutes of HIIT cardio were added to 2 of the lifting days above. I also sometimes threw in 1 cardio-only day (usually a class). So, total of 4-5 days/week in the gym."

I started by using the Weight Watchers app. Keeping track of what I was eating helped me reestablish normal food portions and hunger cues. At 175, I was eating for fun, whether or not I was legit hungry. I also had no idea how much I was supposed to be eating.   After 2 months, I switched over to tracking macros using My Fitness Pal. I wanted to make sure that in addition to hitting daily calorie goals, I was also hitting carb/protein/fat goals. This is when I also started going to the gym. I'd go for 1 hour 4-5 days/week. I'd either lift weights or do cardio (treadmill, spinning, Zumba :). I needed help getting started with weightlifting, but couldn't afford a personal trainer, so I signed up for the strength classes at my gym.

Such a simple statement, but I've never thought of eating in this way. I totally did this when I was heavier, too. Still struggling with it, even though I've reached a healthy weight. How did you stop eating for fun? Did you find something else to replace it? Or did you just change your perspective and try to eat for energy rather than for fun?"
progresspics,3dl4wh,emrose28,11,Fri Jul 17 14:13:15 2015 UTC,"Self awareness. I realized I was eating my emotions. I dealt with stress, boredom, anxiety, sadness, etc by eating. It's much easier to do that than to do the hard work of introspection and addressing your feelings.  Now, I don't eat mindlessly. I like the feeling of being ""light,"" of not eating myself into a food coma and feeling sluggish. I also stopped eating past 8pm, which made a huge impact."

Every 2 weeks, I'll have a day where I don't track and eat what I'm craving.  When I was trying to lose weight, I'd hit the gym 4-5 days/week for 1 hour. I'd do cardio and weight lifting. Sprints on the treadmill, spinning, Zumba classes lol. :] Now, at maintenance, I'll go 3-4 times a week, sometimes less."

I signed up for the strength classes at my gym, which taught me a lot in regards to proper form, and boosted my confidence.

Started off on SL5X5 until I hit a hard plateau. On June 1, 2015 I switched to PHAT for a more hypertrophy-based training program. The latter 6 months were a mix of accidental cutting and a slow bulk, but I'm happy with the end result of less fat than from 6 months ago.   Diet  Mostly kept my diet consistent. The major difference is I added a 900cal+ shake. I messed around with a different combination of ingredients, but the best was a shake with Peanut Butter, Whey, Milk, a banana, oats, and sometimes olive oil (if I needed the extra 100-200 cals).   Supplements were whey, creatine, and a multivitamin.   Tried to keep all the shots consistent in terms of angling and conditions and lighting but the pics were taking in 3 different bathrooms, haha. If there are any more questions, I'd be happy to answer."

I have a gastric sleeve procedure, and have made drastic changes in my diet (very low carb, low fat, high protein), I'm careful about vitamin and nutrient intake, and have increased my physical activity level a lot. It's a long process (about a year and a half total so far, and another 6 months of 'dieting' although I'm already moving into a maintenance mode now.) It's a great tool for weight loss if used correctly."

progresspics,3dnn4l,shackletron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"lol - well, I would say though that lapband and gastric bypass are very different from gastric sleeve (you have to do a lot of research before having surgery to know what you want and what you're getting into.) The lapband is hardly ever used these days, it has proven to be very ineffective and often has to be adjusted far too frequently. Bypass is good, but more invasive and has greater risk for complications. Getting a sleeve is a ton of work, many people don't realize this. Just prepping for it is about a six month process, and many people lose interest / lose commitment in the process. However statistically it keeps weight off longer than another other form of weight loss, which is why I chose it."

progresspics,3dmflb,greenpinkie,6,Fri Jul 17 13:33:29 2015 UTC,"Started tracking calories and working out in late January. The first 20 pounds came off in less than 12 weeks, then I cut my deficit to make sure it would  be sustainable and minimise loose skin. Now averaging about a pound a week, with body fat around 30%. The second pic is the first time I've seen a vaguely defined muscle in my upper arm in years! Yay for deltoids!  I could probably double my rate of loss without too much trouble, but this feels better. 4-5x strength and 2x cardio each week on 1200-1300 is not fun. 1400-1500 makes it easy. Will probably cut back on cals a tiny bit more over the next few months, with the aim of losing another 20 to get under 145 with 25% body fat by the end of October. Then it'll be maintenance plus heavier lifting as we roll into the southern hemisphere summer!"
progresspics,3dmflb,thankyouforfu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:49:59 2015 UTC,"Nice job! Try eating 1250-1300 calories on days you don't exercise, and 1350-1400 on days you do exercise. And eat a bit more carbs on days you exercise as well. Also, consider eating more protein and less carbs overall. Figure out your macros, and consider eating something like 40/40/20 (protein, fat, carbs) to lose more weight -- protein is extremely important in keeping muscle mass while losing pounds."

progresspics,3dmb18,Sugarpiehoneybitch,4,Fri Jul 17 21:36:29 2015 UTC,I do creative substitutions quite a bit myself.  Try using collagen instead of oil in almost anything.  Saves 95% of the calories with same or better mouthfeel.  Last night I actually used red pepper soup as a salad dressing and served it to 6 people who couldn't get enough... but they didn't know what or why.
progresspics,3dmb18,TheBoldManLaughsOnce,2,Fri Jul 17 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I haven't seen collagen for sale in any of my supermarkets. I must look into it.  I really enjoy omlettes, scrambled eggs and whatnot but I hate the idea of adding ~100 calories just to have them. Fry light 1 cal spray is the bee's knees though! Great when you want to grill stuff without it getting stuck too.  All that being said, tomato based sauces just aren't the same without olive oil :)"
progresspics,3dmb18,TheBoldManLaughsOnce,2,Fri Jul 17 14:50:37 2015 UTC,Gelatin is sold in markets.  Pretty much the same thing.  I get it by making stock with bones and reducing it.

I think I'm a coca-cola addict and think this is the main reason I am 'kinda chubby', plus I get a few spots and I think the coke is really bad for my skin. I switched to sugar-free cola at home and have 'cut down' how much I drink but I still find it tough when I'm going to work and I want the sugar/caffeine. Any advise?  And you look great! I don't mind chunky boys but the weight loss really does suit you!"
progresspics,3dmb18,013cqbche,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't even bother with diet drinks. I don't think it's worth it because it's not just the sugar you're addicted to; it's the sweetness and the rewarding neurotransmitters your brain releases when you consume them. A short lived reward and you always want more.  I won't lie, it was pretty tough at first but I just drank plenty of water and replaced the caffeine habit with lots of coffee. No sugar. I drink the sugar free ones now when I'm drinking (mix em with spirits) but nowadays, the idea of even drinking normal sugary soft drinks sickens me. It takes time but it's worth it :)"
progresspics,3dmb18,floor-pi,3,Sat Jul 18 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you! On your advise I have only drank water at work tonight and one black coffee to keep me going, work nights so definitely need some caffeine haha :)"

I also added yoga about 3x a week and cycle short distances instead of driving. I think more importantly I cut down on my alcohol intake.

I didn't really go to the gym if that's any consolation. IMO walking and cycling are easy and enjoyable forms of exercise. You don't have to kill yourself on a treadmill!  However, as I said above, probably 90% of this loss was due to calorie counting!   You can totally do it :) as long as it's on your terms."

I felt compelled, though, because for the first time today I looked at my reflection and thought, ""Wow. I'm really doing it.""  I decided midway through January 2015 that enough was enough and that I couldn't continue my life feeling like an uncomfortable blob. I also feared the example that I was setting for my daughter. So I changed. I eat real food, limit my intake and I move a lot more. At 330 lbs, the amount I had to lose seemed so overwhelming. It's still easy to dismiss compliments or to ignore when people recognize what I've done as an accomplishment-- sure, I'm down 80 but I still have so long to go. I do feel like I can make it now, though. I know that my progress is great and I don't plan on giving up any time soon!  Anyway, just popping in!

I pretty much shave every morning or every other morning. When I took the second set of pictures, the face one was a few minutes before I posted it and I had worked a double-shift...but completely ran outta time the morning of because I missed my alarm. The shirtless was a 3-day weekend that I decided to just be lazy with and do nothing productive.  Definitely not as bad than when I was bigger though! Especially now that my hair is lighter from being out in the sun, it does not look anywhere near as pedo-y.   TL;DR - Don't worry, it ain't news. The stache disappears on the daily."

progresspics,3dlly1,i_dnt_always_comment,2,Sat Jul 18 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"Not really actually! I drink about 140 fl oz of water throughout the day so it keeps my water cycle flowing and my skin moisturized/elastic. The only thing remotely close to loose skin is the little last bit of thin fat I have around my abs that will probably go away when I lose just a bit more.  Probably the worst would be in my inner thighs, but that's pretty much the same thing. I've always had large quads and glutes, so being from NYC I was asked more than once if I was puerto rican ಠ_ಠ.  Thanks though! I posted my face on facebook (first face picture in years) and because every year I kinda use a script to delete everything from the year prior, a lot of people I had met in the past 3 years never saw me skinny. I put the picture with the caption ""100 down!"" because, hey I round up I guess."
progresspics,3dlly1,barronleger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:55 2015 UTC,Your process?
progresspics,3dlly1,somanyroads,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"It was more of a passive weight loss due to me breaking my wrist and fucking up my knee last July (They're almost back to 100% now though!). I also have a hernia that I will be consulted about fixing next month. So my strategy is:   Drinking lots of water. I refill my 33.5 fl Oz water bottle four times a day, so I drink minimum 134 fl oz a day. It also helps with preventing or minimizing loose skin because of hydration helping to naturally moisturize skin and also by keeping the elasticity high. Working long work weeks! I actually love doing this. It gives me both a reason to stand a ton and move around, socialize with both some of my best friends and also new clients every day. Being an extrovert, I can be hit with bas depression if I feel cooped up every day at my house. I also live about 35 minutes from work in the country, so there are more deer out here than humans. Watching what and how much I eat. I always make sure I end up minimum 1200 calories of actual real food (I'm a pretty decent cook, but I always love me some seasoned grilled chicken which, luckily, is a pretty good, lean meal to eat) and maximum 1800 depending on my expected level of activity. I also can't eat large meals without feeling sick from the hernia being pressed against, so the ""5 small meal"" strategy works wonders. I avoid as much sugar as possible. I've never been a huge fan of sugary stuff to begin with, so thats lucky. However, people who are hooked on soda and candy and other stuff with probably have trouble with this one. I keep myself preoccupied, mentally and physically. This one was hard considering I would eat when I was bored or stress.   I've got to run to work right now though! When I remember more things for this list, I'll come back and edit them in."

progresspics,3dl17f,TehSpringRoll,2,Fri Jul 17 06:37:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I started out doing keto + full body lifts.  I went from 209 to about 180.  I got complacent and fell off.  I went back up to 192 and I was disgusted with myself.  I started doing intermittent fasting + keto, and it really shredded the fat super fast.  However, I was doing an IF schedule of 23/1.  It's a little extreme, but it worked for me."
progresspics,3dl17f,xangelxv2,2,Fri Jul 17 06:42:24 2015 UTC,"Damn, looking at this, this is where I want to be in about a year as well. I'm around the same weight as your BEFORE picture. Truly inspirational. I was wondering if you could message me in detail what your diet/routine was and explain some stuff like what is iF schedule of 23/1 and etc."
progresspics,3dl17f,verifiedshitlord,3,Fri Jul 17 11:03:43 2015 UTC,"Hey bro,  I'm glad that you are making the effort to try to make a change.   I'm definitely not an expert, but I'll tell you what I think works.  I did keto which is high fat, moderate protein, and low carb. You wanna try to lower your total calories either by lower fat or carb.    With low carb, you get to eat things like roasted chicken with the skin, sauteed broccoli with cheese and bacon.  Similarly, with low fat you would be eating boiled chicken breast with no skin, boiled broccoli, bread, potatoes, or rice. For me, it's much easier to eat low carb than low fat which is why I chose keto.    Full body lifts are like bench, squat, deadlift, pull up, push up, etc.  These kind of exercises are great for building muscle, if you are doing low rep, high weight.    Intermittent fasting is basically just putting your body in a fasted state to maximize the amount of time that your body is changing fat into glucose (burning fat).  When you fast, your body is encouraged to burn fat because there is no glucose to burn, so it converts your fat into glucose.  Some people do a schedule of 16/8 where you don't eat for 16 hours and eat all of your calories in 8 hours.  I did it to the extreme where I don't eat for 23 hours and I eat all of my calories in 1 hour.  The problem with this is actually finishing your food.  When you don't eat for 23 hours and you have set your caloric goal for a 500 calorie deficit (so say i use 2000 calories a day, 500 calorie deficit would be 1500) .  Then that means I have to eat 1500 calories in that 1  hour.  That's actually more difficult than you would think.  But if you make your calorie deficit too high and if you don't eat enough protein, then you will start burning MUSCLE, which is not what you want to do.  But if you make your calorie deficit too high and you don't eat enough fat, then you won't have any energy to work out. It's pretty counter intuitive but you should check out all of the great resources that reddit has.     https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq   I read this probably like 200 times.    Also, check out this post by another asian guy.  He REALLY inspired me, I hope he does the same for you.  his post: https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/19wsr4/hi_loseit_i_went_from_215_19_at_bodyfat_to_187_at/  his pics!!!:  http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#5  this guy seriously got me feeling like I have got to take control of my life and improve myself.  it was very inspiring.    good luck man, I hope you don't mind that I didn't pm you.  I want to share the love with everyone."

progresspics,3di3vs,Speedtouch1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"As far as diet goes nothing out of the ordinary. I use MyFitnessPal religiously to stay on track. I just eventually had my diet down to a science. I would generally eat the same things for breakfast/lunch/snacks and add variety to my dinner to keep it from getting stale. After my first 6 months I would add a cheat day every sunday. I wouldnt workout and eat something out of the norm while not going overboard.   My workouts consisted of p90x3 and the new p90 program. I lost a ton of weight the first 3 months. I think it was around 45 pounds. I would do ab ripper, go for a 30 minute walk, then a p90x3 workout and do that 6 days a week. After my first program was over i slipped a little bit. I think i gained back around 8 pounds or so before i just said ""what the hell are you doing man?!?"". Thats when i heard about Tony's new p90 workout. It is heavily catered towards beginners. So i got back in to my routine using those workouts to start slow again and work my way back up to where i was. After that i did another round of x3 and now i have set my own custom schedule.   This next year I want to start running and am thinking of ways to change up my workouts. As you progress you have to equally progress your workouts if you want to keep seeing progress. I've been thinking about trying crossfit but we will see where that goes!  Thanks!"

Going to the gym was not enough so I made changes in what I ate. I ditched my morning Starbucks runs and I started counting calories, I'm a visual person so seeing exactly what I ate helped me a lot. I added about 40 mins of cardio (stairs, jogging, walking, box jumps) to my workout routines and hit weights for about 20 mins. I'm a mother of 2 so by the time I got around to dinner it would be super late and I would crash right after (a big no no) so I started meal prepping."

progresspics,3dep7h,ilouisa,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for your kind words!! The leggings in the picture are from a brand named RBX. They are awesome! So easy to move around in and go hiking. I also have another pair from Vogo and I love them almost as much. I got them both from TJ Maxx for about $15! :)

I know some of it was water weight but I must admit I LOVE seeing at least 1 lb drop off every day on my scale.   Thanks I am glad you like my hair color. I love it as well.

progresspics,3dfx07,mytwocats11,2,Thu Jul 16 00:27:44 2015 UTC,That's a pretty substantial difference really! I know it's hard to see on yourself but I see it. I've lost 38 lbs (a little over 17kg) myself and I certainly can't see the difference the way others can.
progresspics,3dfx07,sniffing_accountant,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think that because I wasn't very big in the first place my, weightloss is harder to see, it has just trimmed me inches down in all areas!

progresspics,3dew5j,ApocryphalCanon,2,Thu Jul 16 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"Well its a long story. But I got in an accident causing me to be declared 25% disabled. I just kept gaining, and the pain got worse. So I decided to get gastric bypass surgery. I lost the first 40 lbs on counting calories, got the surgery in april '14 and lost roughly 80 lbs following that. And now I can eat quite normal again, so I am using macros to manage my food intake and lift weights. 4 times a week.  Allthough currently I am dealing with impinchment in my right shoulder and a slipped disc in my back, so full focus on my diet at the moment and walking/swimming as much as I can.   TL;DR Lost 40 lbs, got gastric bypass surgery, lost some more. Counting calories and lifting weights."
progresspics,3dew5j,PC_blood_letter,2,Thu Jul 16 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"And what kept me going was my before and afterpics and not wanting to go back to the pain hell I was in. My body was my prison! I broke out, I dont want to do any more time on the inside!"

progresspics,3deumr,anywayzz,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:01 2015 UTC,Yeah! You're headed in the right direction. Just think.. 4 or 5 months you'll be there or almost there! What are you doing to lose weight?
progresspics,3deumr,anywayzz,3,Wed Jul 15 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"That just gave me such a boost :) the idea of actually reaching my goal at some point is really exciting haha!  I'm tracking on MFP religiously for food, ditching my horrible soda habit for different kinds of tea, using my FitBit to track activity and I've been running a few times a week (I'm upto 5K without stopping and trying to improve!) + trying to do more active things for fun with my boyfriend and friends, like instead of lying around watching Netflix we've been trying to play tennis or soccer or hike or basically anything that involves moving haha :)   I've been trying pretty hard but I'm getting discouraged because it's been ~1.5 months now and I'm only 9 lbs down. I guess I'll have to kick it into high gear!"
progresspics,3deumr,Lilidawn,3,Thu Jul 16 00:19:16 2015 UTC,My biggest problem was when I ate. I'd eat right before bed. Once I stopped doing that and using myfitnesspal religiously.. The pounds started falling off. And running! Who knew how much that would affect weight loss?! I love running now! It's great that your boyfriend is helping you. Makes things so much easier when you have encouragement like that. :)
progresspics,3deumr,anywayzz,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...I should probably pay more attention to the timing of when I eat, it is 10pm here and I just had a snack! I'll definitely keep that in mind for the future :) I love running now too, and I'm glad it has worked for you!!  And yeah, he's been great! He's not overweight but he put on a few pounds working at a desk job for an internship over the winter and he wanted to take that off plus he enjoys being active anyways - it's great having someone like that around!

progresspics,3dfajb,generalpansy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Before: 7/26/2014. Not sure exactly what I weighed, but it was more than 180 lbs.  Today (still ""During""): 7/15/2015. 158 lbs. This is a result of logging everything I eat and sticking to 1250-1350 calories daily since May. No gym yet, but soon! My current goal is 140 lbs, but my ultimate goal is 130-135 lbs.  My husband has also lost a huge amount of weight in the past year! No progress pics of him, but I just wanted to acknowledge how much easier it is to do this with a supportive SO by your side.  (also, my MyFitnessPal username is generalpansy if anyone would like to be friends!)"
progresspics,3dfajb,Larakine,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the weight loss!     So... We're basically twins.     I'm a smidge taller & older (26) but same starting weight, same start date (mid May), same-ish approach (I <3 MFP, not really exercised but going to start as soon as I don't hate myself in a swim suit), same calorie allowance, same progress (I weighed in at just under 158 this morning), same goal weight and I also have a supportive SO who's also trying to lose weight (we're having a race over who's first to lose 20lbs).  :)     I don't do MFP socially and I haven't really been talking about weight loss with anyone except my SO, but I'm gonna add you!"
progresspics,3dfajb,loftio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I accepted your friend request. :) When I joined MFP, I went through one of those ""add me!"" posts for new members on their message board and added ladies with similar stats to me. It makes me feel more accountable for my food choices since I know other people will see them, and it also just feels like I'm part of a secret badass girl gang motivating each other to get healthy!   Also, congrats to you and your SO on your progress as well!"
progresspics,3dfajb,japarker47,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"That's brill progress. I've started calorie counting again using MFP. Can I ask, do you allow yourself any cheat days (for example I've visited my family and can't avoid mum trying to feed me treats!) where you don't count at all or do you log those days too?"
progresspics,3dfajb,baddhinky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you! My best advice to you is to do whatever makes you feel like you're making sustainable changes. All of my previous attempts at weight loss failed miserably because I thought I had to cut out all snacks and treats, which led me to ""cheat day"" binges and lying to myself about how much I was really eating on those days.   What I do is I try to make room for a treat or a snack in my regular daily budget. I know this doesn't work for everyone because sometimes it's impossible to eat just two squares of chocolate, but I find that it really helped me feel like I wasn't depriving myself. I give myself a pass some days when I know I'll be eating over (like dinner at a friend's house or special occasions), but it's intentional and I log everything as best as I can.   The most important thing to remember is that you're only human. You're trying to make a huge lifestyle change, and there will be days when you mess up and go over. When that happens, accept it and move on. Don't beat yourself up about it, don't make yourself feel guilty, just say ""oops, i'll try to do better tomorrow."""
progresspics,3dfajb,dreamgal042,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"Looking a bit roomier these days.  Terrific progress both from you and your husband! I agree with you, as I am in the same boat (my wife and I are in this together), it is SO much easier when it's a team game!"

progresspics,3debky,funchords,3,Wed Jul 15 18:01:27 2015 UTC,I'm hoping to keep it going. I honestly didn't even really notice a huge difference until I went to buy some new pants and found I could comfortably wear a 38 instead of a 40 (my old 42s fell straight off). Planning a 10 mile hike on the Appalachian Trail this weekend which will be my longest yet but hoping my daily hikes will have prepared me :)
progresspics,3debky,ricecilantrolime,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:19 2015 UTC,Is that app mfp? cool that they tell you % lost
progresspics,3debky,JCSwneu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:47:01 2015 UTC,Yep I use it on my iPhone every day and track what I eat as well as exercise. I don't really think TOO much about altering my diet but I think tracking really does make me feel more accountable. Like I'd be less likely to get some big fast food meal because I would feel guilty about having to track it haha
progresspics,3debky,grassfedgrass,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with hiking!
progresspics,3debky,mytwocats11,2,Thu Jul 16 03:13:39 2015 UTC,"That's awesome.  Hiking is so underrated, probably because it does take more time than some other workouts, but it's good for the mind.  Throw in some good hills and you've got glutes, abs and quads covered."
progresspics,3debky,mytwocats11,3,Thu Jul 16 03:28:27 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly. I really have fallen in love with it because it does take a little longer but it's much more relaxing than being on a treadmill and it doesn't feel like exercise. I just go for a nice walk in the woods with my dog and then when I finish my shirt looks like I went swimming in it
progresspics,3debky,Southern_Oak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:39 2015 UTC,That's why I love it too. Although it definitely feels like exercise after a certain point (I do about 25 miles on weekends sometimes and boy do I feel it on Monday).
progresspics,3debky,giantblueox,3,Thu Jul 16 13:56:21 2015 UTC,I've never done that long of a hike before but I am planning a 10 mile section of the appalachian trail on Sunday which will be my longest hike ever. So I'm excited to see how my daily hikes have hopefully conditioned me for it
progresspics,3debky,chrisbsi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:21 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I usually just do laps around a state park. We do have some pretty ones here in MI though.
progresspics,3debky,jjl39,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:32 2015 UTC,This is the spot where I go all the time. It's a nice little trail just minutes from my office so it's easy to get out and go every day :)

progresspics,3df50b,urban_maelstrom,4,Wed Jul 15 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Legs are mostly plyometric work, and single leg movements.  i.e. pistol squats, jumping lunges (alternating), box jumps, and sprinting...  I tend to focus on more explosive and challenging work rather than focus on time under tension or the amount of weight.  I usually focus on balance, flexibility, and speed."
progresspics,3df50b,Babyjclark3,3,Thu Jul 16 02:18:49 2015 UTC,What is your typical weekly workout routine?  Where do you get your protein from? And iron and calcium? What is a typical food chart for your day? (I'm looking into eating less meat but really haven't figured out how some people do it).
progresspics,3df50b,OlBastard,3,Thu Jul 16 04:34:01 2015 UTC,"The thing about protein is that its overrated. It is exploited by the supplement companies... the amount of protein you actually need is not much and should get enough from any diet as long as you eat plenty of food. Kale is a great source of calcium, and on top of that any  type of greens are 1. alkaline 2. help with opening the blood vessels which is great before a workout 3. great antioxidant properties. So my favorite meals are salads, along with avacados, tomatoes. Beans are a great vegan protein source as well as nuts.  As for my workout routine, I usually do a full body workout for about an hour and a half, 3-4 times a week allowing for maximal recovery periods, and cardio 2-3 times a week."

progresspics,3db2qb,scribblerontheroof,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:56:09 2015 UTC,"well I struggled most of my life with binge eating and gained a lot of weight after I had my son in 2012. After countless diets and trying to eat healthy nothing was working. I had gastric sleeve in november, and this was done primarily to combat the binge eating (i really didn't eat horribly, just never had an off button)   after this I cut portions (given) as well as counting calories and making sure to get a sufficient amount of protein, also I have been training for a marathon at the end of the year so lots of running and weight training.   I also have been taking a line of vitamin supplements to help with energy and gastric issues. So I take plexus slim every morning and use their probiotics to balance the bacteria within my stomach and help me sleep better at night."

progresspics,3dbqps,Yo_whats_up,4,Wed Jul 15 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"My diet was, above all else, consistent. Breakfast was small (typically mixed nuts and fruit). Lunch was also pretty small (typically some other blend of mixed nuts). I still liked to feel like I could eat without guilt, so I usually saved like half of my calories for dinner (typically some kind of pasta with red sauce) and an evening snack (something low calorie, but filling, like popchips or pretzels with hummus). I let myself ""cheat"" maybe once or twice a month (more often as I lost the weight), but the trick was to minimize the damage... i.e. eating pizza, but not an entire pizza... the calorie difference isn't that huge with that approach to cheating, but the mental difference is amazing... small cheats still leave hope; big cheats made me give up in the past."

We used to be big into gaming and eating meals out of boxes, frozen or ""just add water."" We both put the weight on quickly thanks to that lifestyle. I've always had my baby fat so when even more packed on, I had enough. Mostly we changed our diet, more home cooked meals from scratch, less eating out, drinking more water, the basics. We did start running at the gym for about 20 minutes every few days. I already have a job that requires me to constantly be on my feet so getting exercise wasn't a big deal. We started hiking and enjoying the outdoors, no more candy in front of the computer while video gaming. It seems almost too good to be true that that was all we had to do. However, I will admit we are both now tiny twig people and would appreciate any tips on how to build the muscle without bulking up again."

I work in Midtown Manhattan so lunch options are often expensive and caloric. Another big factor for me is planning my meals. Even when I go out to eat, I look at the menu before to know what I want and do research. I always log the calories first to make sure there are no surprises after eating. I generally avoid pasta, bread, and tortillas as well. However, I do eat anything I want - just am cautious and aware of how many calories are involved and adjusting the portion accordingly."
progresspics,3dbter,grassfedgrass,4,Wed Jul 15 12:20:38 2015 UTC,Nothing makes us aware of what we put into our bodies like tracking calories.  Weighing and measuring food is a sobering experience and it really helps to see where the food budget money goes.

progresspics,3d9ktk,TheAntiCynic,2,Tue Jul 14 16:10:46 2015 UTC,Herbalife is a scam and a half.  Thanks for being honest.
progresspics,3d9ktk,TheAntiCynic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:36:08 2015 UTC,Why is herbalife a scam?  Is it because it's a pyramid scheme?  Do you know of others who have had similar experience like op?
progresspics,3d9ktk,nomoominshere,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:09:16 2015 UTC,There's a lot of documentation on the internet about this.  But also because the products are a bit overpriced and not that great.

We actually have a guy that just turned 40 this week that's lost 180+ pounds in a little over a year.   It's all about setting your mind to it and then crushing it.

progresspics,3d9ktk,M4Silver,3,Tue Jul 14 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Nice job!  Curious - you didn't really explain how you lost a bunch of weight but your blood work still ended up way worse.  Was it because, even though you had lost weight, you were still eating terribly?  Also, after that, you said you really committed to the gym, but did you commit to a better diet?  What's been your diet since you made that change?"
progresspics,3d9ktk,Slowestgreyhound,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"The first 50 pounds that I lost was really gradual, like over the course of four years and my nutrition, while i thought was pretty good, was really bad. Again I think my blood results worsened as a result of years of poor diet and the Herbalife shakes I was taking.   As for now, I started a new eating plan when I joined my current gym and learned how to really eat healthy. They started me on a super strict diet but now I eat pretty much what I want so long as it fits in my daily macros. Also tracking my food on MFP and meal prepping are essential tools for my success."
progresspics,3d9ktk,GDTBATH,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for sharing and explaining everything in detail.  You look amazing.  Your transformation is specially admirable because everyone in you family is overweight.  Not only that you changed your self, but you broke the cycle; two of the life's hardest things to do. I am really surprised to hear about herbalife.  Do you know specifically why your blood work got worse while you were substituting meals with herbalife?  If anyone else can chime in I would really appreciate it."

progresspics,3daslw,TheColostomizer,4,Tue Jul 14 22:02:50 2015 UTC,That's honestly why I posted this!  I was so discouraged by basically every source online telling me that you can't really lose that pouch from previous weight gain. There was such a long period of time (years) that I thought I would never be able to achieve my goal of having abs that show.  I'm glad this post is encouraging! Good luck and you can do it!
progresspics,3daslw,AmouTsukasa,2,Tue Jul 14 22:17:24 2015 UTC,Looking awesome. Did you have lots of loose skin? If you dont mind me asking.
progresspics,3daslw,AmouTsukasa,3,Wed Jul 15 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/Qs4VEYr Ask anything you'd like! Uploaded that pic ust to show you an example. Not even my worst spot but those are hard pictures to take! So yes, I did and still do. It just isn't as noticeable since I try to workout a lot and eat healthy to keep my skin tight. I was very lucky to grow a little after initial major weight loss too. But remember clearly the discouragement that loose skin and stretch marks caused me. I contemplated surgery, and still sometimes do when I'm being very self-judgemental. The fact that most people love putting down your accomplishments by pointing out the flaws you still have doesn't help. So now I always recommend losing the weight slowly and using coconut oil or other skin products to improve elasticity during the weight loss. And of course exercise exercise exercise. It naturally helps tighten skin, which is why I don't really have any sagging skin anymore. Sorry for the long reply, but I hope I was helpful!"
progresspics,3daslw,leftylugnutz,3,Wed Jul 15 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you didnt post that picture I would not have guessed you had loose skin what so ever. You'd probably understand that getting the weight off is more of a priority so slowly probably won't be the case haha. I'm glad you posted this, lots of photos of surgery but if you can look this good without... I rather this then pay tons of money for a more prominent scar as well."

Can I ask specifically what kind of exercises you do for your back, or if you follow any kind of routine?   For four months that is insane progress. How much of a deficit did you eat at/did you do any cardio? Very impressed man, the hard work shows."
progresspics,3daslw,ConvertsToMetric,2,Wed Jul 15 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my man. Appreciate the encouragement!  I'll be honest, these are only about 1 month apart. Which seems to have people riled up and calling bullshit. But I have previous experience in the gym, so good muscle memory, and was really over weight, which causes me to gain fat really really quickly.   As for back, I always give credit to P90X. A lot of people think it's a gimmick. Well I started and finished my first 90 days using assistance. Ended up doing another cycle and upon completion was able to rep out 30 pull ups in a row and complete each workout with ease. Followed that with back day literally consisting of just pull ups. About 10-12 sets of ten or the first couple sets did 15-20 and adjusted the rest to that.   My workout regimen is now pretty diverse. It mostly consists of body weight workouts, calisthenics, and some weights. I literally don't have a set order ever. I love just switching days and muscle groups up that Most people usually workout together. Been told that's ""bro science"" but hell it really works better than anything else for me. I hate running so I turn what most people would make a 1 1/2- 2 hr workout and condense it into a 30-45 min workout. I do this by super setting like crazy. Usually 3 sets of 7-10 different workouts with a minute or two break after completing 1 whole superset. So that really turned into my cardio and keeps muscle endurance up there.   As for diet, I usually have two protien shakes (breakfast and lunch) but sometimes skip the first one. I finish my day with fresh grilled meats or fish with usually two different types of veggies for dinner. One big thing for my body is no eating 3 hours before bed.  I calorie counted and macro'd for my initial major weight loss and absolutely hated it!   Sorry my replies are fuckin gargantuan, brotha! My passion is health and fitness, and can't resist trying to help out and go on and on about what helped me."

progresspics,3db7th,chapsticksandy,11,Tue Jul 14 22:40:43 2015 UTC,"First off, you look great! Awesome work so far! You need to be honest with yourself and appreciate all the work you've done up till now. Second, I would heavily recommend a fitness routine of some kind and I don't just mean running. Not saying you need to go to the gym but SOMETHING that will incorporate upper and lower body (martial arts, climbing, various sports etc..) it will go a long way in changing your body shape. Find something though that you ENJOY so that it can be something you will stick with."
progresspics,3db7th,s4ltydog,3,Tue Jul 14 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"I've been working out regularly since March of 2014. Just as a measure of improvement, I've increased my max bench by 100 lbs. I've made plenty of improvements in other areas, but I guess it's not really showing."
progresspics,3db7th,s4ltydog,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:06 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I'm no lifting pro by ANY means but maybe switch up the routine a bit. Shock the system you know? Otherwise just keep it up! As I said you've made some awesome progress so far!
progresspics,3db7th,AmouTsukasa,4,Wed Jul 15 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"Dude great progress! You are at a great number now! You look awesome. Just maintain and gain muscle. Majority lean muscle at that height and 150 looks great. Maybe that will help with the dysmorphia and maybe in the end you'll be looking towards gaining mass again, not fat but muscle mass! I for sure did.  Good luck and don't look down on yourself. You did a fantasic job and look great."
progresspics,3db7th,leftylugnutz,3,Wed Jul 15 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"Good work man, seriously, slimming down that much has done a ton for your aesthetics. I wouldn't worry about your image, as a stranger I see nothing to be embarrassed or worried about.  It looks like you have hit your first goal, losing weight. I read that you have been lifting since March (so you're 4 months in) so you should ask yourself what your new goal is. I would recommend trying to gain muscle if you still like lifting! I didn't see any huge improvements until I had been at it for 5 months (thats when other people starting commenting on gainz)  You want to make sure you are lifting heavy but more importantly REGULARLY. At least 4-5 times a week. Work on increasing your weights on reps by 5-10 pounds every week or every other week. Also make sure you are getting enough protein. I personally like my three day routine, A- Push, B- pull, C- Legs/shoulders so it looks like  ABCxABC with x being a rest day. Throw in some core workouts and some cardio or HIIT training a few days a week and you will definitely see some progress, hell, I already see plenty.   There are tons of variables and by no means is this an end all solution, but you have already put a ton of work into your body. You keep at it and it WILL show.   Good luck man! Kill it!"

As soon as you start seeing results with your lifting you realize you can create any shape you want and start to get a lot more bold in terms of your desires. I've been lifting for 3 years and I think anyone would consider me to be fit but I'm at a point where I still think it'll take a year to get where I want to be. Just keep at it, no one tells you how long it takes to truly transform."

Last year I made an agreement with myself that I would stop making decisions out of negative emotions. It doesn't help all the time, but it helps me to be more honest with myself. If you feel like your beard is your protection, it's time to let it go. You can always grow it back. If you truly love your beard and are not using it as a shield, then leave it! It's your face, man. That's the mug you show everyone you meet! Gotta be honest with yourself and show the world who you are, bearded or not."

Come up with like 5-10 possible shapes/styles/lengths, etc, and then work your way through them fullest/longest to shortest?  You'd have a nice album of all the possible looks you might choose to adopt again one day.  Plus, unless you decide you have to go back to the look you're rocking today, it won't take 2 years.  Good luck."

progresspics,3d4awn,tiagor2,140,Tue Jul 14 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"After three years of diet and exercise, I've returned to the same body weight as the start of my fitness journey. The documented start, anyway; I was 15-20 pounds heavier in 2011, but hadn't started taking progress pictures at the time.  I wanted to post before/after photos at my original weight just to illustrate a point: the number on the scale doesn't tell the whole story. The same weight can mean vastly different things in terms of health, fitness and appearance. If you're obsessing over what the scale says to the exclusion of all else, then you may be missing the bigger picture.  If anyone is interested in the 'how', you can take a look at the progress post I made at /r/fitness last summer. That post covered the basics of my training and diet strategy, and has more intermediate progress pics. It's a year old, but the last year has basically been more of the same, so it's still relevant. I don't intend to write up a similarly detailed progress post again this summer, as there's been only marginal progress in my physique over the last year, and very little has changed compared to what I wrote last year. There have been some minor tweaks to my routine, but the only notable change in the last year is that I supplemented with caffeine and ephedrine for this spring's cut.  This is actually the second time that I've been at my original weight. I first hit 137 in January while bulking up, and have just cut back down again. Regretfully, I didn't take any progress pictures during the bulk. I wish I did, because I was actually leaner when I bulked past 137 lbs than I am now.  Satisfaction with my long term change aside, I've actually been very disappointed with my results over the last few months. I met (or readily exceeded) the strength goals I set for my winter bulk, and reached 145 lbs @ 12.5% body fat before I transitioned into cutting back down. My goal for the cut was to hit 137 lbs with body fat below 9% by the start of the summer. That... did not work out as planned. I'm three weeks late getting to the goal weight, and with BF about 2 points higher than I wanted it. I had a much harder time than in previous years retaining muscle mass on a cut, and lost a lot more strength than I was prepared for.  At this point, I'm undecided whether I'll keep going with the cut, or change my diet for maintenance or a slow bulk for the rest of the summer. I'm not as lean as I want to be, but losing muscle and constantly struggling to lift the same weights as last week is frustrating at best, and depressing at worst; I don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice any more muscle on the quest for perfectly shredded abs.  One last thing to state the obvious that I'm sure some people will comment on: yes, the image quality of my bathroom mirror selfies has improved over the years (better camera and years of practice); yes, tanning and body hair management is a considerable part of the difference."
progresspics,3d4awn,ciscomd,8,Mon Jul 13 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in the body hair management part. I'm as hairy as you are, and had partners hint to me that I should consider shaving/waxing my torso/shoulder/arms. That coupled with the tattoos I plan on getting makes me really think about it. However, my experience with the other areas of hair that I do manage (head, beard, groin) tells me that it's a constant, boring, itchy endeavor.  So basically, how hard is it? How painful is it? How itchy is it?"

We have similar backgrounds, what with the skinny fat and nerdiness (this isn't an insult. I like graphs too). The only difference is that I used to be skinny fit, then in the last couple years I've become skinny fat. I hate it and I am completely disgusted with my body. I went from 160 lbs to 190 lbs in 2 years. So, like you, aesthetics are above strength, mainly because I know I'm already fit, being that I've been active my whole life (skateboarding and parkour). Thing is, I became much less active in the past 2 years, thus the significant pudge around the midsection.  Over the past 6 months, however, I've started to reel it in and try to get my diet under control while actively lifting for the first time in my life (never picked up a weight until this past January). My problem is staying consistent, in that I will track my diet down to the calorie, but after 3-4 weeks I'm like, ""Fuck it! Nothing is working! I'm still fat!"" and I stop tracking. So, it's kinda self-fulfilling prophecy.  Today, though, I'm starting once again, so this is a perfectly timed post from you. I will use it as motivation to move forward and to remind myself that, unfortunately, transformations like this take time. I want to be my former self in 12 weeks, not 12 months. I hope this time next year I'll be able to make a progress post much like yours, complete with graphs and charts and shit. Until then, it's a day by day struggle.  Thanks for the post. Stay strong!"

The fact that your progress is slowing down or you're having to make tradeoffs for additional ""progress"" is a good thing, it lets you know you're getting close to your genetic potential. You might see progress for another year, but ultimately you're getting close to your 'ideal' ... So what you choose to do after that is up to you.

progresspics,3d4awn,Brigante87,11,Mon Jul 13 15:27:18 2015 UTC,There's quite a difference. The chest hair and muscle change I understand. The movement of the belly button confuses and intrigues me. That thing moved up several inches.
progresspics,3d4awn,PictureTraveller,9,Mon Jul 13 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"So, now I'm doing some literal navel-gazing. Thanks for making me super self-conscious about my belly button.  I guess the apparent movement would be due to a few factors. One, my pants are a lot lower in the after pictures. Lower rise jeans versus cheap Walmart pants, and they're intentionally pulled down lower on the hips that I would normally wear them. Seriously, if I didn't manscape, you'd probably be seeing where the goody trail turns into pubic jungle here. Also, the camera angle is lower, I'm standing straighter, and the belly is solid and being held firm instead of flabby and distended."

You're the gal with the incredible transformation, intimidating bows, and what appears to be a growing shoe collection in the background. I upvoted without commenting on your thread the other week, but congrats on your own job well done.  The wax and shave question is never a straight forward answer. In the case of this picture:   Chest and abs were self-waxed at home with Veet strips two weeks prior (first time I've tried this) Shoulders and upper back were done with an epilator, I think a week prior (I've been doing this off and on for a couple years) Upper arms are shaved (electric) Just about everything else gets an electric trimmer   Most of the year, I just trim everything as the best compromise for appearance and effort. Shaving the chest isn't an option for me, as the ingrown hairs are too bad; some leave marks that take months to disappear, and I worry that really bad ones could leave longer term scars. Epilating the chest is literally bloody and looks pretty horrific for a solid week or two, so I gave up on that long ago. Waxing, with proper skin care, looks pretty gnarly for the first few days after, but looks fine after a week."
progresspics,3d4awn,CinEther,12,Tue Jul 14 10:52:59 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, hi! Haha! That sounds like so much work. I haven't shaved my legs in a week (but my leg hair is super fine and blonde too, so it's really hard to see) because I have super sensitive skin and I tend to break out. I tried the veet strips and had welts for over a week. I've never used an epilator before, it sounds painful.   Anyways, you look amazing and thank you so much for responding to me and for the kind words! :D"
progresspics,3d4awn,krokenlochen,4,Mon Jul 13 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"Epilators do hurt more than waxing, and problems like skin irritation tend to be worse as well. That said, the chest is the only area where it's exceedingly unpleasant. I don't know if it's just me or if it's true for most men, but chest hair is by far the hardest to attack. The back might be worse for guys that are particularly hirsute - I'm fortunate in that I only have a scattered stray hairs on my upper back."

progresspics,3d4awn,XApparition-,7,Mon Jul 13 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Question for you - during the initial year, how much cardio did you work in? I'm skinny fat and am always worried about the cardio aspect as people keep saying to limit cardio and just bulk till you hit a goal bulking weight.  From the looks of it, during your first year, it seems like you did both lift and run - can you expand on your schedule during this time in terms of mixing cardio with lifts?"
progresspics,3d4awn,aswokei,4,Mon Jul 13 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Steady state cardio isn't something that I ever kept track of - I just did it as time permitted, or necessity demanded. I mostly did cardio when I had reading to do, so in some cases (before exams if I was behind with my textbook reading) I'd spend 3-4 straight hours straight on a cardio machine. It was never consistent, so I can't expand in any detail.  I can say that, after I finished university this year and no longer had any textbooks to force me into cardio, I realized that I was probably under-estimating how much of an impact it had on my caloric maintenance level."

progresspics,3d83g3,Zeplove25,2,Tue Jul 14 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. If I feel under the beard, there's definitely a budding jawline springing up. Thanks!"
progresspics,3d83g3,ArsenicGerbil,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean man, I went from 260 to 205lbs and literally looking at my body in the mirror I felt like i was looking at the exact same shape as before I started working out.  Obviously I knew I was getting stronger wearing smaller pant/shirt sizes and everbody was complimenting me, but my brain played tricks on me whenever I looked in the mirror I still saw that overweight guy lazy AF.  Can definitely see your change, keep it up man."
progresspics,3d83g3,leftylugnutz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely see it. Face is sharper, jawline more sloped."
progresspics,3d83g3,powerarmee,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:15 2015 UTC,I think my beard may be hiding the jawline to some extent. But I can't bring myself to shave it haha
progresspics,3d83g3,powerarmee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"You don't see the difference because you are used to ""knowing"" what you look like in the mirror. You're still seeing what you ""know."" Eventually you will walk by a mirror or a window and catch your reflection and think ""woah who is that"" and realize it's you. You do look SO different. Congratulations on all of your hard work :)"
progresspics,3d83g3,chackzo,3,Tue Jul 14 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, I notice the fact that I'm down from ""XL is tight"" to ""L is somewhat roomy"". So there is that!   I definitely think you're right here. I see myself every day, and so if I'm losing a couple pounds a week, it's not very obvious. Whereas people who only see me every few months seem to think I look like an entirely different person."
progresspics,3d9msa,Jemjemxx91,3,Tue Jul 14 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"I looked at your other post and I can definitely see how much weight you've from that picture. Amazing work, almost 100lbs lost is such an achievement. Do you feel awesome? You must feel awesome. You look great in both pictures."

progresspics,3d6y1a,bonkette,3,Tue Jul 14 13:20:04 2015 UTC,Your face doesn't look chubby. Just because you have soft features (ie not hard cuts) doesn't  make it chubby. You look so much healthier!

As someone who actually knows about makeup, I can tell you that she definitely contoured her face in this photo, but you can only contour so much. Don't be an idiot who thinks losing nearly 100 pounds won't define your chin and cheekbones."

progresspics,3d5y8f,dr_kaizer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"lift wise, I did the exact same routine bulking as I did cutting.   Monday: Chest/Delts emphasis on chest  Tues: Legs and Abs  Wed: Chest/Delts  Thurs: Back/legs  Friday: Chest/Delts emphasis on delts  I'm a rather weak individual for my size.  I would love to be stronger so I added in some low rep high weight to help with strength during the bulk.  All days average around 30-35 sets, except back day which gets 40.  each set starts at 12 reps and as the weight increases drops to 3 over 5 sets.  Basketball for cardio once a week during the cut."

I'm no expert on nutrition but have been training for years, I can give you a little bro sci that's worked for me.  This is a typical day's eating. I try to eat every 3 hours and always try get about 30grams (at least) of protein per meal.  9am I have 2 scrambled eggs and beans (I use baked beans, I don't know if you've heard of them, probably any type of bean would work as long as you can eat them with eggs!)  At 12pm I'll have an all in 1 supplement shake. USN anabolic muscle fuel works for me.  At 3pm I'll have 2 wholemean bread and peanut butter sandwiches with fruit/ nuts/ yogurt.  At 6pm I'll have chicken, rice and greens.  At 9pm I'll have another shake.  Follow that meal routine everyday (you can swap the chicken for fish/ Turkey ect) and I promise you'll grow.  Give me a message if you want any more ideas!"

Lollies I have a hard time not eating but I do have some cheat days every month.   Most of the carbs I was craving was because of the flavours they can carry...so now I have pasta sauce with zoodles, burritos without the wrap, yiros salad, etc. and I get to eat decadent stuff like bacon and salmon and peanut butter (sugar free kind!), as well as melted butter on vegetables, etc. it's luxurious!  I guess it works for me because a cheat will kick me out of Keto, so it's no longer ""oh I'll just have a few lollies"" and then eating the whole packet. I just don't have it at all."

progresspics,3d0u58,bumbletowne,2,Mon Jul 13 13:45:55 2015 UTC,I have kind of a weird question: how did you handle entering foods you made by hand in MFP? I've found the tool cumbersome since I make everything by hand. It literally takes me 2-3 hours a day to figure out proportions and ingredients going from other sites to figure out calories per proportion.   I'm just looking for shortcuts.
progresspics,3d0u58,enrichmentonly,9,Mon Jul 13 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"It definitely should not be taking you two hours a day. My SO likes the recipe tool, but I just enter things as I add them to the food. Weigh on the food scale, dump it in. If I'm cooking for me, I just enter it like that. If I'm cooking for both of us, I divide what it weighs out to by 2 and then just split what I made in half before serving. I don't often make things with more servings than that, but when I do, I just split it based on how my servings I am making. I would say it takes me zero extra time because I do it while I'm cooking, but I am also a lazy cook who doesn't make fancy shit very often."
progresspics,3d0u58,wendy_stop_that,4,Mon Jul 13 00:21:34 2015 UTC,Ah. I am definitely a foodie. Every meal is fancy home cooked from raw ingredients and it ends up taking forever. I usually end up ditching doing this because it is such a chore. I guess a scale and doing it while cooking would cut down on the time. Thanks for the help.
progresspics,3d0u58,potentialredditor,8,Mon Jul 13 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"I am definitely a foodie. Every meal is fancy home cooked from raw ingredients and it ends up taking forever.   This is exactly why I couldn't lose weight. No matter how healthy the recipe is, by the time you've tasted and tested, the calories add up and it's so hard to keep track of everything.    My meals consist of 3-4 ingredients, max.  It's the only way I ever lose any wieght.  Example- Tilapia seasoned with citrus peppercorn seasoning and broccoli sauteed with a bit of himalayan sea salt and butter. Or arugula+avocado+tuna+bolthouse farms greek yogurt dressing."

Question: How/why do you have different caloric intakes each day? I was trying to figure out a way to divide out my weekly caloric intake so I could have one cheat day and not feel terrible about being in the red (if you know what I mean).
progresspics,3d0u58,ogstoph,10,Mon Jul 13 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I work out a lot. If you worked out as much as I work out, you absolutely could.   The calories change because I log my cardio."
progresspics,3d0u58,kazneus,0,Mon Jul 13 04:59:33 2015 UTC,How often/much do you work out? I've heard from some that you shouldn't eat what you burned off. Thoughts on that? Did you change your diet? Did you start just cardio and add weights? I am doing mainly cardio because I get super bored with doing weights.
progresspics,3d0u58,FlowerTaming,7,Mon Jul 13 05:43:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if you are trying to maintain your weight and you don't eat back what you burn in some way or another (be it TDEE or the MFP method)... you won't succeed. You'll keep losing. Also plenty of people on MFP and the like log shit that is not really exercise (""Oh I cleaned for 90 minutes!""), eat it back, and sabotage themselves. But, in my opinion, if you are heavily working out and do not fuel that at all, you're not helping yourself and you're going to feel like shit.   And yes, I started by cutting calories, but it turned out that exercising more and also eating more was both way more enjoyable and made me feel WAY better. I did a variety of cardio-y things (Jillian Michael's 30 day shred, Insanity), then added the /r/bodyweightfitness beginner routine, then changed my cardio-y things around December (running, swimming), then switched from body weight to lifting heavy in February.   Now, I lift 3 days a week for about an hour (legs/abs/shoulders one day, then chest/triceps, then back/biceps) and in theory I run two days a week, swim two days a week, and bike two days a week, but I definitely lean on the running side because it's always an option (outside is never closed!), and I do miss cardio days on occasion, especially when I am on vacation, which I just was! (Getting back in the swing of things today.) If you ask MFP how much I exercise, it looks like this (though this is just cardio; weights are an additional 3 hours a week on top of this.): http://imgur.com/sIZ6PpC"

progresspics,3d2urt,mmmagnetic,2,Mon Jul 13 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"Until very recently, I looked much like you in the before pic, but with a bit more belly fat. Over the past years, multiple people have pointed out my weight in a ""good natured"" way :  -My girlfriends grandmother (she was known for being brash)  -The boyfriend of my cousin (he gave a little slap on my gut)  -Multiple other random friends, one said ""Wow, it's so cold today! Aren't you freezing in your thin jacket? Or is your belly keeping you warm? Haha!"" That was an adult woman who I would never have guessed would be able to do such an off the mark comment. She's a nice person usually so I wasn't really angry, but man, that one stung. She must have realized what a terrible joke that was.   Maybe here in Germany people celebrate their directness a bit too much sometimes (a common trope is that Americans are ""shallow"" and never say what they really think), but I was really thinking that if I was a woman, nobody would have dared to point out the obvious in such a nonchalant manner to me.   That started really motivating me, though. Did basic calorie counting and simple bodyweight exercise at home, and my beer gut, slight moobs and especially my fatty face stated slimming very fast.   People pointing out how you lost weight is an incredible feeling, but seeing the progress every day in the mirror is an even greater reward. I spent my 20s with that annoying beer gut, but now in my early 30 I begin to think that I'm starting to look better than ever before in my life.   So, yeah, upfront honest can sting like hell, but in the end, it's just pointing out the obvious - something we ourselves can be very blind to. I used to be blind to my own road to chubbiness for years and years.   And in the end, being fat isn't part of your personality. I think people pointed it out so much because they knew it would be so easy to lose that abdominal fat (and it really is). If I had been morbidly obese, people would very likely not mentioned it because that would just be cruel, but in retrospect I think people were just saying ""hey, you're getting pretty fat here, maybe hold the cookies for a while.""  That's why I think the space between hurting feelings and saying like it is is a fine line worth walking. You can love yourself AND strive to be more aware of what your body really needs.  Edit : sorry, ended up only talking about myself. Your progress is amazing! Does your son point our your muscles like he pointed out your moobs? :D"

progresspics,3d33kk,walrus42,2,Mon Jul 13 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I started off with those dumbells that adjust from 5-50lbs and a bench. I would do a lot of flys and presses trying to build up some chest and deltoid strength, then I would work on my core the next day holding myself in plank position and doing crunches and legs lifts, then the next day curls and skull crushers etc, but then I got a gym membership and that has helped out immensely.   When I first started at the gym I was doing a lot of high rep (12-15 reps x 3-4 sets) weight lifts, but I wasn't adding any size, so within the past month I just switched up my routine to a lower rep routine (5-7 reps x 5 sets) and my body has started responding really well.   Monday Chest   15 minutes on the stair master to get the blood flowing  incline dumbells 5x4  incline flys 10x4  flat bench 5x5  decline bench 5x5  cable flys 15x5  forward dips until failure  push-ups until failure   Tuesday legs   15 minutes on the stair master  7x5 squats  7x5 hamstring curl  7x5 quad curls  10x5 calf raises   Wednesday back/shoulders split   15 minutes stair master  15x3 pull-ups  10 x 4 bent over rows  10 x 4 bent over reverse flys  10 x 4 lat pull downs  10 x 3 deadlifts  15 x 3 lateral delt raises   10 x 3 standing overhead press   Thursday arms   7 x 5 barbell curls  7 x 5 concentration curls  7 x 5 hammer curls  7 x 5 preacher curls  7 x 5 tricep cable extensions (with the rope thing that you pull apart as you extend)  7 x 5 skull crushers  7 x 5 seated dips  body weight dips until failure  Then on saturdays is when I usually try to convince my friends to go to the gym with me, and we do whatever they are feeling those days and I work on some core/cardio"
progresspics,3d33kk,walrus42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"The beginning of that accurately describes my position. I have no gym membership and I'm working with either 12 or 25 pound dumb bells. I don't even have a bench, I just lay on the couch to do flys, and the rest I work on the floor. I've been doing all sorts of push-ups and chest exercises but I feel like I'll get nowhere decent without a gym membership"
progresspics,3d33kk,thankyouforfu,2,Mon Jul 13 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"well it will definitely help doing those, even if you are just doing pushups it will help build strength and your core. When I first started I wouldn't even do 10 proper form pushups. I started using the dumbbells regularly and got to a point where I would do 400 pushups of different variations in about half an hour before I got my gym membership. What you could do aswell it take a back pack and put some weights in it (or just anything heavy that won't hurt your back i.e; a bag of dogfood etc.) and tighten it down and use that when doing push ups to add weight. You might have to get ghetto about it, but if you are creative and motivated enough I'm sure you can figure it out."
progresspics,3d33kk,bigspinningbat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that. I actually tried the backpack trick and It was working for a while, until I figured if it works for push-ups, it might work for squats too. So when I was squatting, the backpack ripped. So I've gone back to just using dumbbells in very stupid ways. Hopefully I can get a membership soon, I'm not doing it all for looks, but that's a big part of it. I feel like I won't get that big with just dumbbells on the couch"

progresspics,3d2j8q,Valoween,2,Mon Jul 13 06:00:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I just started counting out 500 calories for breakfast, and 500 for lunch. Because my parents handle dinner, I felt I couldn't get an exact fix on the calorie count for that meal without being more obtrusive than I wanted to, so I just left it open.  After about a month and a half I stopped counting calories after I noticed that my natural eating habits had changed for the better. My weight loss slowed, but I was still losing weight. I may go back to counting later, but I'm not sure."

progresspics,3d1px9,Kingofthegnome,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:40:53 2015 UTC,Just heads up! I did Keto for 1 year and lost 60 pounds but gained back 40 over the course of 2 years after. When getting off keto DO NOT BINGE. You will be amazed how quick going from full keto can turn into sesame chicken and fried rice once a week. You body is operating at a defect so even eating 2200 calories after a few months of keto you will gain weight. When you get off the diet add fruit and veg back first and try to hold that for about 2-3 months (24 days to make a habit) then beans then rice. Try away from fried food and fast food for life(I am okay with subway but that is me).   Keep up the awesome work!
progresspics,3d1px9,CuredPorkBelly,3,Mon Jul 13 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We our family are doing keto as a lifestyle change, then when we are healthy weight switching to paleo. I have PCOS and can only eat 19 carbs a day per my endocrinologist."

progresspics,3d1px9,oxfordtwiel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:17 2015 UTC,Why would they get off keto if it's making them healthier?
progresspics,3d1px9,ma-ccc-slp,0,Wed Jul 15 09:08:13 2015 UTC,"Keto is good for a temporary solution. You lose weight very fast but gain a lot of it back. The first 2 weeks you deplete all your glycogen and water weight so getting off keto it is not uncommon to gain back 5-15 pounds in the first week. Also eating so much fat and red meat can really mess with your sugar levels turning you pre diabetic and can raise your cholesterol a ton. I was on keto and ate very little red meat but had a string cheese once a day and my cholesterol raised 40 points in a year. I think for 2-3 months is safe and 6 months is okay but I would never tell anyone to do it for years and years. Still being healthy is eating more greens, exercising more and limiting red meat and alcohol. It is slower but at the end of a year i you still up you will keep the weight off."
progresspics,3d1px9,ApocryphalCanon,2,Wed Jul 15 13:15:21 2015 UTC,Thanks but I'll  be sticking with keto long term.  I have no interest in putting the weight back on and getting fat and ugly again

progresspics,3d0jaa,thoroughbred_ofsin,20,Sun Jul 12 14:11:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to bulk up your arms and legs, start lifting weights. You won't look like a female body builder unless you make a conscious effort to do so, so don't worry about becoming too muscle-y or manly.  Here are two good starting resources:  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/womans_lean_sexy_bible.htm http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html  The second link is a list of muscles and so you could target specific areas you'd like to do workouts for. It gives some ideas. As well, there is /r/xxfitness for women and there's lots of advice in the wikis of fitness related subreddits as well."

progresspics,3d0jaa,annzabelle,5,Sun Jul 12 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"In order to add more shape and muscle to your body you'll need to start using weights, it's fun. I would advise to start on a routine that is full body and incorporates everything, legs, back, chest, arms, shoulders, core. Usually for a beginner routine I'd recommend frequency over volume and hitting each body part more times per week. So a 2 or 3 day split with one rest day would be great. Common 2 day split would be upper body/lower body. 3 day split maybe push/pull/legs. The wiki in /r/fitness would be a great starting point or /r/bodybuilding. The great thing about lifting is you can eat more and you will burn more calories because of the extra muscle, so lots of people can do minimal cardio and still stay lean. Hope this helps."

Finished that and then started running two miles about 3-4 times a week. So I did insanity and completely changed my diet. Cut out all soft drinks, got fast food maybe once a week, was eating a lot of lean protein.   I also started walking my dog more, and have walked him about 2-4 miles per day ever since day 1. As you can see in the after pic, I also got a fitbit which I recently began using alongside MFP.  I honestly have just been back into weights for a couple of weeks now but I do chest/triceps, legs, back/biceps all twice a week with a rest day usually on Sunday. Also doing an elliptical every day for 30 mins on level 10.  Recently, I eat a lot of grilled chicken, grilled turkey burgers, and Boars Head deli meats for my main meals along with salads, fresh fruit and nuts.   As for supplements/vitamins, I'm taking GNC AMP Wheybolic Extreme 60 Power as my post-workout shake along with a multivitamin, fish oil, and was taking vitamin D in the cold months."

progresspics,3d0vhu,EggzOverEazy,4,Sun Jul 12 16:12:48 2015 UTC,"In the past year and a half, I've finally made steps towards becoming the man I want to be. I started doing things that my fat kept me from doing, like playing racquetball, basketball, kickball, hiking, swimming, biking. My body responds real well to keto, so all my success has come from a high fat, low carb diet.  I started walking in March 2014, and by July 2014 I could run a 5k. Over the winter, I didn't run much and when I started running again in April of this year, a mile was difficult. Last week I did 6.5 miles in 66 minutes.   Jiu jitsu has been my main motivation in keeping the weight off, it was also one of the main reasons I lost the weight to begin with (if anyone is thinking about trying it, try it NOW, do NOT wait to lose weight!). I fell in the love with grappling, and I do it about every day now.  In August of 2014, I got a new job, got busy, and got cocky about my weight loss. I thought I could take it easy and not be so strict on myself, but I promptly gained 30 lbs. In March 2015 I did a jits tournament and was in the 200 lbs, heavyweight division. I got destroyed by very athletic competitors. I realized I was kidding myself if I thought I had my health under control. Since that embarrassment, I recommitted to jits and to the diet. I compete again at the end of this month, and I'm hoping to make a cut to 162 lbs to fight in the lightweight division.  Being strict is a lot easier than being careless. When I'm strict, I eat smart and I feel great. When I'm careless, I eat crap and feel like crap.  My life finally feels like something I can be proud of."

I remember seeing you last time around and being floored~  That being said, your last post photo has been taken and used to advertise some weightloss thing. I saw it on an ad a couple weeks back. I only remember for sure because I saved your picture in the motivation picture mountain album in my phone. (The skull being the thing that stuck out when I came across your pic being used on the ad.)  I can only recommend putting more stuff on your photo that would deter people from easily taking and using it for stuff like that."

progresspics,3cxytw,Soon2BDeleted,19,Sat Jul 11 23:43:19 2015 UTC,I always think it's awesome when couples achieve their weight goals together like this. I hear my friends often bitching about their spouses and being unable to say something like how about we work out together and not crumble the others self esteem. I'm not sure how you two decided to take this on together but it seems like you have good communication if you've gotten this far on the journey already.
progresspics,3cxytw,Sasha_Fire,5,Sat Jul 11 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"Answering on my throwaway.  My wife is overweight and cuts me down at every turn when I try and keep healthy. I have a bike that I ride (not as often as I should), I walk the dog daily, I go to the gym to work out at least once a week...but from her I get nothing but shit and trouble. She does the cooking so it's never anything healthy. If I want more healthy cooking I have to do it myself and she complains the whole time. Frankly, she needs it more than me but her poor self esteem and denial make it easier to cut me down for trying."

progresspics,3cxytw,Ur_favourite_psycho,5,Sun Jul 12 00:26:41 2015 UTC,She won't go any more because the therapist basically told her she was in the wrong.
progresspics,3cxytw,urection,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:34:14 2015 UTC,Doesn't that make you build up a ton of resentments and eventually not want to be with her?
progresspics,3cxytw,urection,3,Sun Jul 12 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. Next week is our 22nd wedding anniversary and each year gets harder and harder. I love her but she has hereditary health issues that if she doesn't address she'll be basically screwed (like her mom). But she refuses to do anything. She drinks, smokes a pack a day, eats like shit, refuses to exercise, and drinks at least a 6-12 sodas every day.  We are hardly physically intimate any longer and part of that is my lack of interest.  But it's hard to basically throw away 22 years of marriage for something that can be fixed with a little work. I envy OP and his husband for their relationship and healthy lifestyle."
progresspics,3cxytw,urection,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a candid response, I hear a lot of similar stuff like this from my friends now who have only been married 10 years or less. It's super off putting for me to even want to try to find someone in case I end up resenting them for not changing or growing as the years progress.   It sounds like she's digging herself to an early grave with her life style, I seriously hope she makes a change for herself even if it's not also for you. Hopefully she's open to change sometime so you're not feeling like this forever."

I avoid regular squats because I have horrible balance on that leg, but I spend time working on balance too. I can still run, I'll do about an 8 minute mile and that leg gets its own time for calf raises with no weight.

Turns out that was one of the things that was stopping us from getting pregnant (had tried for 9 years unsuccessfully). Got preggers and had a beautiful baby boy. He's going on four months old, but through the whole ordeal our time devoted to the gym and eating right has slipped away and we've gained about 40-50lbs back.   Keep at it no matter what life throws at you guys. And don't let your self slip. When you get to where you want to be saying ""not today"" or ""tomorrow"" is the first step in a landslide of ending up right back where you started.

However he wants to lose quite a bit more weight to get him back to his weight from when we first got together.   I have gained nearly 30lbs. Due to steroids for an autoimmune disorder on top of another 30 I wanted to lose before I got sick.   I REALLY need to lose the weight. My husband, looks great, but he has said time and again he isn't happy where he is and wants to lose the 30lbs. He's gained since we got together 6 years ago.

We really don't eat any bread anymore and pasta. I also used myfitness pal and watched my calories (1200), he didn't count his but definitely cut down on the amount he was eating We started to run regularly - 5 days a week usually around 3km on average We also started to do activities together like bike riding and tennis - so much fun!!"

progresspics,3cwa6g,rhunter99,8,Sat Jul 11 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"As I said earlier in the thread, motivation is overrated. It is sure to disappear somewhere down the journey. When it does, trust that the decision you took initially to start losing weight is the correct one.   And be disciplined. If you feel like the motivation is going, just be disciplined and stick to the regime even if you don't want to. To help with this,  dont thinking of it as losing a 100 lbs,  chop it down into smaller targets.  However, the best bit about the journey you're going to take is the mirror. Take pictures of yourself regularly and see how far you've come from when you started- that should give you a little boost to keep going.  Good luck!!"
progresspics,3cwa6g,nomoominshere,3,Sat Jul 11 18:00:47 2015 UTC,That's how I did it. I've still got 20lbs left but I started at 263 and am around 200 now.  I'd break it down into 10lb segments. It was a lot easier mentally that way.

progresspics,3cwa6g,Miller-STGT,17,Sat Jul 11 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"90% of it was a change in diet.  Ensured that I maintained a calorie deficit on most days, exercised  every now and then.  Maintaining a calorie deficit didn't mean that I had to give up everything g I loved eating either;  it just meant I had to eat those foods FAAAAR less  often. What really helped me keep going with the diet was to try and find ways to make my food tasty without making it u healthy. And, I had an easy  way to do so- indian recipes. Indian food can be surprisingly healthy, especially the vegetarian stuff.  Now that I've hit my target weight, I've started working out just to keep fit.  Also, people told me that I needed to be motivated to lose weight. I completely disagree with that; I think discipline is far more important."
progresspics,3cwa6g,Miller-STGT,5,Sat Jul 11 15:37:41 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100% on the motivation vs. discipline thing. It's all about discipline. Willpower and motivation runs out when discipline sticks by you and makes you just do it!   Also? You look very handsome. Hubba hubba!

progresspics,3cvvyf,tablasaurus,36,Sat Jul 11 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"(whoops, meant to add, F/26/5'10"" to my title, but totally spaced, sorry!)  Sooooo,  I don't typically discuss weight loss on public forums, because I have a lot of complicated feelings about it, but I wanted a space to celebrate my little milestone of only having 100 lbs to go. So here's my backstory!  I've been fat my entire life. I was born 10 lbs. 12 oz. and have been overweight every single day of my life since. When I was a teenager, I yo-yo dieted in a desperate attempt to not be overweight, only to fail because of my unrealistic goals every time, which eventually led to me giving up entirely. To ice that cake, I developed binge eating disorder in my young adulthood. I was absolutely fucking miserable.  A few years ago, I woke up and noticed my knees made a terrible crackling sound when I bent them, which was soon accompanied by a tremendous amount of pain. I hadn't weighed myself in a very long time, but the last time I had, I weighed 350 lbs at 5' 10"", which had taken a toll on my joints. My doctor diagnosed me with knee osteoarthritis, a condition prevelant in folks with bigger bodies. From a body image perspective, I had learned to love myself at whatever size I was, as I feel strongly that too much pressure is put on everyone to look a certain way. However, I was fucking miserable that my body was starting to stop functioning properly, and decided I was going to do something about it.  But ""doing something"" took several years. I just never found the self-motivation, and when my condition got so bad that even a light jog was excruciating, it became more difficult to even try. But eventually, a couple years later, I found exercises to alleviate pressure on my knees, and finally came to the realization that I needed to feed my body properly, not starve it. After a year of slow progress and another year of steady work, I have lost at least 90 pounds, and have never been happier or more confident. Again, it's not about vanity, just that I feel better in every way. Because I'm taking care of my body, I'm more motivated to take care of myself in other ways. I take better care of my hygiene, my mental health, and even the space I live in. My knees are still an issue, but I have noticed that the more active I am, and the more weight I lose, the less they hurt!  The picture on the left is the only full-body shot I had taken of myself when I was above 300lbs, probably somewhere around 350. I know, without a doubt, that 350 was not my highest weight, but I was too terrified to find out what it really was. At times when I beat myself up because I'm still so far from my goal, I just look at that photo and it keeps me on the right track.  For those of you with oer 100 pounds to lose: as hard as it is, do NOT let slow progress discourage you! Don't give up just because you have so much more to lose than your gym buddies. You can do this, no matter how long it takes, no matter how many times you fall off the wagon. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me!"

progresspics,3cxhtm,Daniellamb,7,Sat Jul 11 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"Hi there Reddit!  My name is Daniel and I wanted to share with you my weight loss journey.  Firstly, I apologize for not having more conventional pictures.  The idea of being half naked on the internet fills me with a lot of anxiety, and I don't have a lot of pictures of myself so I'm giving you what I have for now.    Some backstory: I was always a really fat little kid.  I remember being bullied for it a lot in school and not really understanding why they hated me for how I looked.  This led to some pretty early developing depression, which led to me eating more and more. By the time I was 11 years old, I had reached a height of 5'6 and a weight of 230 pounds.  I don't have any pictures of this, unfortunately.  Due to my depression and anxiety, I wanted to die all the time.  I hated myself for being fat because that's what everyone else had taught me to do.  I realize now that this wasn't a justified reasoning for losing weight, but we'll get to that later.  In the summer of 2003, I became severely depressed and switched to a vegetarian diet and had grown to my current height of 5'11.  Good work, right? Not really.  What this basically meant for me is that I limited myself food as much as possible and ran/lifted weights in my room for 3-5 hours a day.  As you can guess, I lost weight pretty quickly.  When my freshman year of high school started, I had dropped to 150 pounds (thankfully with no health issues due to my idiocy) and felt like a completely new person.  This resulted in 4 years of self hate and body dysmorphia since I still never felt like my body was adequate.  Despite this, I was able to make a lot of friends for the first time in my life, and even start dating.  Previously, girls would mock me when I asked them to ""date"" me.   Fast forward to 2008.  My depression and anxiety had hit a breaking point.  I was failing in school, had lost a majority of my friendships and had become a sever recluse.  They kicked me out of school because my grades had gone from straight A's to straight F's and my principle told me that I would not amount to anything in live because I lacked motivation.  This did little more than fuel my self-hate and give substance to it.  I lived with my grandmother at the time (story for another time), who I respected and loved.  I was ashamed at what I had done, so I packed my things and left without a word.  I spent the next 6 months living on couches and out of my car.  During this time, I got up to about 180 in weight, but not much more than that since I couldn't really afford to eat that much. I had abandoned vegetarianism completely since it was no longer sustainable.  Over the next few years, I worked minimum wage jobs and hardly left my house.  My depression ruled me, but I did have a girlfriend at the time.  She left me around 2010 because I had gotten back to 210 pounds and she ""couldn't handle me being such a pussy all the time"".  This was another low point in my life.  In 2011, I was starting to deal with my depression more effectively.  I decided that if I wanted to be happy, I needed to make positive changes in my life.  This is why in February 2011, I moved to Colorado with $2,000 in my wallet and a suitcase full of clothes. A close friend of mine had an aunt who let us stay with her initially.  I still am very close with her, she's an amazing woman and has taught me a lot about the power of positivist.  Fast forward some more to early 2014.  I had been with my girlfriend at the time for nearly 2 years.  When we started dating, I was about 200 pounds and she was 5'7 and 135.  We were in pretty good shape, all things considering.  By 2014, however, we had both gained about 50 pounds each.  We were extremely unhealthy, depressed, recluses, and unsure of what to do.  We broke up in April 2014 due to personal issues (not excluding the weight) and went our separate ways.  I moved back in with my friend's aunt and decided it was time for me to make some serious life changes.  I started watching what I ate, started walking more, running more and generally just having fun.  I dropped from 250 to 220 by December 2014.  This is the first time I can remember losing weight and feeling good about how I did it.  I felt invincible.  Around January I met my current girlfriend.  She and I were both a little chubby when we met and we decided that we were done complaining about our weight and ready to start a new life.  It was around that time that I bought a book called ""Thug Kitchen"".  Now, I don't normally like to advertise anything, but this book has probably saved my life in more ways than one.  As we read through the pages we slowly learned that none of the recipes called for meat or dairy.  Being that I've never done well with lactose in the first place, and neither of us have really eaten much meat in our lives, this caused a lighbulb effect.  Vegan.    Now, we're not living a vegan lifestyle necessarily, but our diet has switched to completely vegan as of late May. Since then, my stomach has stopped feeling bloated all the time, we've each lost 20 pounds and we feel the healthiest we ever have. My mood has improved ten-fold and my depression has become a million times more manageable.  My current goal is to get to 170 and see where we go from there.  I'd like to start going to the gym, but I still deal with a considerable amount of anxiety issues and I'm afraid of doing something wrong/being harassed by people.  I'm sure I'll get over this eventually, but right now I feel amazing and I'm excited for the future.  Misc Points:  I'm sorry if this is laid out poorly, I've never been much of a writer and putting all of this out for other's to see is terrifying to me. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of having my picture taken, so as I stated at the beginning, I'm just working with what I have.  I know that why I originally wanted to lose weight was unhealthy and for the wrong motivation.  Simply put, I was anorexic.  I don't tell people this, they don't take it seriously since I'm a guy.  You'd be surprised how little people understand about mental illness and how much damage ignorance to that can do. I've been cursed at, screamed at and made to feel like a piece of shit for sharing my journey through weight loss and mental illness. I was diagnosed with manic depression, generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD when I was young.  I've tried killing myself a few times (thankfully unsuccessfully) when I was younger, and still think about it on my worst days.  If you're struggling with depression or body image issues, please seek help from a professional.  This is something I've never done due to my fear of judgement and the shame I have for a lot of my problems, but I know it's the right thing to do.  Thankfully, I have a wonderful support system at this time and it's become less of an issue.  Just know that if you're struggling with mental illness, there are people who care out there and who will help. You are loved and life is worth it.  Make positive changes to your life and your attitude and it will pay off tenfold.  Despite being forced out/dropping out of school, I found a career when I moved to Denver and after 4 years of hard work, I've pretty much cemented myself in my industry. This played a big part I'm sure, as being broke and unable to afford lodging/food much of the time made my situation a whole lot worse.  I've left out a lot of details as this could probably be a 300 page story and I wanted to keep it as short as possible.  I'm also not trying to push a vegan diet.  That's just what is working for me.  There are a lot of healthy ways to lose weight, but my bad eating habits and depression usually cause me to fail with them.  I like being vegan because I make healthy meals and eat the fuck out of them.  I find that my portions are naturally changing, and I'm not forcing myself to starve.  In any case, thank you for reading my story and I hope that it can be some kind of motivation for someone to make positive changes in their life."

progresspics,3csrdo,Modotti,6,Fri Jul 10 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"YouTube + a program (Stronglifts, Strongcurves, Ice Cream Fitness, Starting Strength) made it so much easier for me to start doing weights. My physical weight loss slowed down but the ""toning"" and body composition changes have been truly dramatic. I highly recommend it!"
progresspics,3csrdo,theGuatemalanYMCA,2,Fri Jul 10 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Stronglifts is a great program to start.  Just download the free app and read about how it works on their website.  It's only 5 lifts, so you don't need to remember as much.  Just have someone show you/make sure you're using proper form.  You will end up (eventually) lifting quite heavy which will get you the best results (you won't end up looking bulky) and it covers all of your muscle groups."
progresspics,3csrdo,CrimeFightingScience,15,Sat Jul 11 01:09:26 2015 UTC,Just walk up to any dude in the gym and ask them to teach you - I 100% guarantee they will lol (because you are hot).  Find the one that looks like they know what they are doing xD

progresspics,3csrdo,OnceUponTheCross,3,Fri Jul 10 18:02:56 2015 UTC,Honestly it might be worth spending some money on a few personal training sessions to teach you some basic lifts and how to organize a workout routine.
progresspics,3csrdo,Summerie,3,Fri Jul 10 20:42:27 2015 UTC,To be honest only the people who are very self conscious will be judging you for making sure you are doing a workout correctly. In my opinion people only care about how they look themselves.

I contacted a personal trainer at my gym, worked with him for two months and now I know enough to do it on my own.  The thing that demotivates most people I think is that they're unsure of what to do and because of that they don't get enough/any results.  You look amazing btw, great job on the weightloss!"

progresspics,3csrdo,Wafflecone416,2,Fri Jul 10 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"It is best to understand that you need a plan.  Like what you do when you ""lift weights"".  The reason plans like 5x5 and Starting Strength are popular is that they prescribe a very specific formula you do 3 days a week.  Two workouts, A and B, and you alternate.  Do a lot of reading cause there is a lot of thought surrounding this stuff seems crazy and complicated, but a lot of the execution is usually as simple as memorizing a couple routines.  I personally made myself two PDF's and printed them out of the workouts and used them for reference for the first two weeks, now I know it by heart.    Good Job!"

progresspics,3csrdo,sniffing_accountant,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:56:20 2015 UTC,I've been going to the gym more than 4 years regularly 3-6 times a week and still pull out the youtube video once in a while when I'm uncertain about form.
progresspics,3csrdo,JeebusChrist,0,Sat Jul 11 02:20:57 2015 UTC,"At planet fitness they have FREE training. They will teach you the equipment. I spent so long on an elliptical staring at the weights section longingly but too afraid to get started. The first few days after I finally worked up the courage I'm sure I looked like an idiot and I was definitely embarrassed. But I pushed past it and now I know how to use (most of)  the machines. Also you would be surprised at how much strength training you can do with just the dumbells. Serious strength training,  not just holding five pound weights as you walk on the treadmill.   For what it's worth I think you look fantastic and don't need to lose another pound."

progresspics,3csrdo,Expert-here,9,Fri Jul 10 21:13:58 2015 UTC,How fat is distributed on your body is determined by your genetics more or less.  If your body doesn't particularly like to store fat in your boobs then they're going to shrink when you lose weight.  If it's any consolation you'll still look hotter skinnier even with less boobage.

progresspics,3csrdo,omgfuck,2,Fri Jul 10 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely go in for work if you can afford it and it makes you feel better about your body image, since your bust is one area that you don't have a whole lot of control over. After all the hard work you've done, the additional confidence boost is well deserved."
progresspics,3csrdo,jinguthepingu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:38:01 2015 UTC,My friend lost a bunch of weight and she just had them lifted and now they look great. No implants just a little tuck to correct that deflated look. And you won't need a bra after either.
progresspics,3csrdo,PantyHamster,35,Fri Jul 10 23:37:59 2015 UTC,You can be a model easy.

progresspics,3csrdo,japarker47,-9,Fri Jul 10 16:59:15 2015 UTC,Might need to be significantly taller but on being attractive absolutely.   Edit - Damn people are fucking aggressive on here today. Whys everybody being so dickish models are hired on height.
progresspics,3csrdo,Crash_Gordon,5,Fri Jul 10 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why people downvoted you, because you are right. She does not meet the minimal height requirement and, let's be honest, models weigh about 30 lbs less than her. I am not going to debate whether that is healthy or not, but it is what it is. No, she could not be a model, but that does not in any way minimise OP's achievements. Also, people who say stuff like ""oh, you could be a model!"" usually have no idea what models actually look like, how little they weigh and what other requirements they need to meet."
progresspics,3csrdo,souldecay,2,Sat Jul 11 06:10:15 2015 UTC,Yup thanks for understanding things beyond everybody thinking someone is mildly attractive therefore they should model.
progresspics,3csrdo,prodical,6,Sat Jul 11 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's very, very true. Most modelling opportunities will have a clear restriction on height. Slim body, fair skin, great facial structure doesn't mean anything when the dresses they want to show don't fit properly because your legs aren't long enough.  My cousin is an aspiring model/actress, more focus on acting than modelling, mostly because she's gotten turned down for modelling opportunities due to her height, 5'7"". Between 5'8"" - 6'0"" is pretty much the industry sweet spot - models who are outside of that range usually got into the industry due to fame/experience in other fields or had their modelling career built by a famous or well-known photographer.  That said, the height restrictions are much more relaxed for most catalog and bikini models, but it is up to the clothing designer and the photographers that choose who they put in their clothing/advertisements.  What you said isn't negative at all towards OP - who does look great! - it's just the truth of the modelling industry.  Additional edit: Even petite models are still generally 5'5"" and up, and there are very little opportunities that specifically ask for a petite model. All of this is of course, for what is considered to be ""fashion modelling"". Other aspects of modelling don't really have any requirement for height - like artistic photography."
progresspics,3csrdo,therealpignewton,5,Fri Jul 10 22:36:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why I'm not sure why I've been bombarded. Your Heights are a bit off BTW until you Crack like 6'3-6'4 taller is better. There's so many available girls wanting to be models nobody needs to be picky.

progresspics,3ct06x,bigasahouse,3,Sat Jul 11 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"No, I hated sports up until the age of 25. Then I started some cycling and running, but it was nothing to be considered serious and I've looked like in the before picture up until the age of 37. Also I did not care about nutrition up until age 37 at all.  It might be worth noting that I consider myself an absolutely regular guy in terms of body pre-disposition. I'm not one of those guys who literally can just look at a barbell at get muscular. Not at all. But I have one big asset and that is being very consistent and target-oriented with my goals."

Out of the two, allegedly copper peptides is the best bet.  Retinol can either be bought over the counter or as prescription for a stronger variant (e.g. Retin-A).   Copper peptides can be bought over the counter - I, myself, am thinking about this one to get rid of some stretch marks on my breasts, but I've heard that it works really well on other areas of your body too.  Only, the skin gets extra sensitive to sunlight when using copper peptides and retinol, so if your wife wants to try either she should use a good sunscreen or avoid the sun altogether. Also, it takes perhaps 6-9 months to see full results."

It was only 15 pounds and mostly fluids anyway."
progresspics,3coh5l,craylash,-8,Thu Jul 9 17:34:37 2015 UTC,Same. I find it sickening how the norm is to fatten up and give up weight-control over the course of the pregnancy.

progresspics,3coh5l,UrinalMint,2,Thu Jul 9 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that from most people, it's the lack of information on her routine which is causing issues. She says anyone can do it then gives no details? And that's disregarding how some women are really affected by loose skin, especially after twins. Stretch marks can ravage your belly and no amount of exercise and healthy living will ever really fix it."
progresspics,3coh5l,awfulmcnofilter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:28:12 2015 UTC,"Whether or not she did get medical assistance, OP doesn't owe anyone her routine or workouts. Diet and exercise. There's nothing else. Yes pregnancy can wreak havoc on a belly, but many women also walk away with the same belly they started with. To assume that since her stomach looks flat after twins that she MUST have had work done is just low and bitter."

Losing one's mobility is one thing. Losing the capacity to celebrate another's achievement is something else entirely.  It's time to get the surgery."

progresspics,3coh5l,hustl3tree5,7,Fri Jul 10 04:48:33 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, sir. I wonder how she manages enough time in the gym while still taking care of her kids or if she has nannies or something. (or she's a stay at home mom) That's what I wonder about when people show progress pictures like this and gain so little weight during their pregnancy. My sister is super fit and jogged with her boys in a stroller after she had them, which is how she lost the weight. However, she didn't have a job outside of her kids so she could schedule jogging when she didn't have any other obligations. I feel like saying ""anybody can do it"" this quickly is unfair to the moms who have jobs and have to choose between sacrificing time with their children and being fit. Anybody can eat right, but having time to exercise that heavily is a luxury that not everyone can afford.   This is not me bashing on OP, because her progress is amazing. I'm very impressed and it's awesome she can do this, however saying anybody can is unfair to the working moms who can't afford gym memberships, expensive double jogging strollers, or childcare. It also doesn't take into account the women with less than perfect pregnancies like your wife that have complications outside of their control.  Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not saying it's not possible for everyone to lose weight after pregnancy, just that the vast majority of women can't do it this quickly or that profoundly."
progresspics,3coh5l,stevencoys,0,Fri Jul 10 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like saying ""anybody can do it"" this quickly is unfair to the moms who   don't think its important enough and not willing to make the changes necessary.   You want it, you can have it. Period."
progresspics,3coh5l,Balleness,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:19 2015 UTC,Well a lot of my weight now is pure muscle so it's a bit skewed. I may have weighed 140lbs but I shed a ton of weight prior to putting on more weight during bulking for competition training.

progresspics,3cqvro,annzabelle,3,Fri Jul 10 08:24:17 2015 UTC,"I ran pretty much every day, but had rest days definitely. I could only managae a 12-minute mile at first, but I'm now at 7-ish minutes. I lifted light weights about every other day (I took weight training in gym class senior year), which helped a lot even though I wasn't power-lifting. Though, I do want to try bigger, non-dumbbell lifting soon.  I made sure to eat my fruits and veggies and measured my servings. I had oatmeal for breakfast, and then snacked through out the day instead of just having one big lunch, and I had a light-ish dinner. I can't eat nearly as much as I used to, my stomach has lost that capacity, ha. I stopped eating processed food. No junk food, but I never really ate that stuff anyway. I'm a vegetarian now, and that only processed thing I eat is from a local ice cream parlor, but it's Amish ice cream, so it's still not-all-that-processed.  I'm just lucky I got bear-genes from my dad which amplified the effects of even minor weight lifting. If I didn't answer your questions don't be afraid to ask more. Thanks!"

I took the second photo because I was feeling discouraged and wanted to see if there was actually any difference.  My goal weight is 150 lbs. I'm giving myself two years to hit this goal. My all time high weight (when I was pregnant) was 313. I lost 40 lbs within two or three weeks of giving birth (baby/placenta/water weight) but stalled back at what was around my pre-pregnancy weight.  Decided to give being healthier a go - started counting calories (around 1700 a day - MFP username: rubybramble) and c25k. I'm currently injured (BOO!) so my running has taken a back seat until I can see a doctor. I did buy a Tracy Anderson workout dvd so I'm excited to do that in the meantime.

progresspics,3cp5l1,dalmationsr0ck,4,Thu Jul 9 18:08:40 2015 UTC,"damn! that's impressive for just lifting! I guess then ramp up the cardio, do some HIIT to burn extra fat if you want. You look great now though congrats on the progress!"
progresspics,3cp5l1,KoNy_BoLoGnA,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:38 2015 UTC,Sorry but what is HIIT
progresspics,3cp5l1,dalmationsr0ck,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:10 2015 UTC,High intensity interval training. It will kick your ass but you can get like 45-60min of training done in less than half the time. It's brutal but I think a lot of fun and keeps your mind off the actual exercise.
progresspics,3cp5l1,SunkistOrange,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"High intensity interval! So you can do this in a circuit type workout where you do things like box jumps, lunge jumps, lost more (google it) and you can do it in Cardio/running/treadmill form - so like run on low intensity for 2 mins then 1 min EXTRA high (like sprinting/feel like youre gonna die) and repeat"
progresspics,3cp5l1,-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_--,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"It stands for High Intensity Interval Training. There are a ton of different site and routines, so you just have to google and find the right one for you, unless someone can suggest a good one?"

progresspics,3cp5l1,ItsMeShotty,3,Thu Jul 9 18:52:39 2015 UTC,thank you so much. I've always had natural muscle which kind of helps.
progresspics,3cp5l1,57001,2,Thu Jul 9 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"What are your goals?  To lose more weight?  Gain more muscle?  Both?  You look good at this point so you could probably focus less on cardio and more on toning, lifting weights, bodyweight exercises, core workouts, etc.  If you are still looking to lose weight, try mixing up the routine.  If you have been doing 30+ minute runs or something like that, switch to shorter, harder cardio sessions.  Your body gets used to your workouts after a while, so it's all about changing it up and finding something new that works.  Your calorie intake will probably have to drop too.  Once you get to a certain point, you start maintaining instead of losing weight."
progresspics,3cp5l1,bagelsandkittens,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"I would like to tone up, but no doubt I still have some body fat to lose. I'm also having problems with diet because of my work schedule."
progresspics,3cp5l1,bigchiefhoho,3,Thu Jul 9 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.  I'd say try to find out what your maintenance calories intake is and try to shoot for a couple hundred under it while upping cardio.  Try mixing up your lifting and incorporating other things into your routine.  It also helps to keep from getting bored at the gym and in your routine.  Work schedules are tough.  Try to prepare food in advance and have healthy snacks with you at work, etc.  Eventually you'll start losing and getting more toned.  It isn't an instant fix and can sometimes take a while for the body to adjust and start going in the direction you want it to again."

progresspics,3cp5l1,flembag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"Nice progress! We started at pretty much exactly the same spot. :)  If you're trying to lose fat, the answer is always diet. Exercise will make you look and feel better and will help burn a few calories, but if you've hit a stall with the weight-loss, you need to eat less. Maybe drop your calories by a 100-200 per day for a week or so and see if you start losing again. If you think your calories are already low enough, double-check your measuring. I usually find that my plateaus are caused by portion creep (ie, ""Oh, that looks like about half a cup!"" when it's really more like 3/4 cup), and measuring strictly gets things moving again."
progresspics,3cp5l1,flembag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"Great job. You look fantastic. Try incorporating a hiit workout for your cardio. Start lifting compound sets. I saw the biggest progress from squatting, ohp, bench, row, and DL."

You would be amazed at the differences you can make by changing little things in the way you are eating. Here are somethings to consider, and things that have helped me:  *Do you do cardio, and if so, how often.  *How often am I having cheat meals? *How often do you change up your workout? Someone previously had mentioned HIIT, which is a good form of training. DON'T do crossfit.  *Do you practice yoga?    Other than that, you look really good. Typically, when you feel like you're hitting a dead end, it's a sign that you need to make a change."

Most of my progress has been the result of living a keto lifestyle and eventually incorporating exercise. I was almost 31 years old and weighed 358.6lbs (I'm also 5'9"", btw). I was depressed, frustrated, had been single for a decade, and more than occasionally contemplated suicide. Smart eating is the tool. Exercise is the anti-depressant. Tough day at work? Go for a walk/jog/run/bike ride. Angry for whatever reason? Take it out on the iron. Consider it active meditation... physical therapy.  Regarding starting, just do it... whatever ""it"" is. Start small, start slow, but start anything. Walking. Jogging on an elliptical. Zumba. Any exercise is better than no exercise. I can't recall when I figured it out, because so many epiphanies are fraudulent, but at some point it really clicked that I was going to die. Regardless of when, how, or from what, I will die.

I have naturally high IGF levels (around 330), which I believe is from keto dieting, but if those drop I will probably add HGH. I'm hoping I won't need to for a few years because that shit is super expensive."

I started my quest back in December 2012 at 349lbs looking to get down to around 200lbs, hit an all-time low of 293.5lbs in April 2014, but I fell off off the wagon, so to speak. Back to square one and then some; I'm around 370lbs now.  What did you do to keep yourself motivated, on track, and to prevent yourself from overeating? That's my weakness."
progresspics,3ckk0l,urection,7,Thu Jul 9 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"I lost the weight on a keto diet. It worked exceptionally well for me. Keto is also a great diet for taming the appetite. Its hard to overeat on keto.  Also, I never focused on the end goal. It was too much to imagine, too far away, and hence not very motivational. I rather focused only on the very short term. Every pound I lost reinforced my will to lose the next one. Its simple, but focusing on the ""micro-achievements"" kept me on the course."

I would really recommend you start strength training sooner than later. It is extremely beneficial to weight loss and body recomposition and the sooner you get started the sooner you will see results. It is also a great stress reliever and an excellent confidence builder.

progresspics,3ckqnc,amj00,36,Wed Jul 8 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"Alright, so, I was dating the captain of the rugby team, so I was always at the house parties. Now... the main rugby house (my boyfriend at the time didn't live at this house, he was actually really neat) was gross. Gross doesn't describe how unsanitary this house was. Good thing their landlord virtually never came by because they would have legally been in trouble. Even with making repairs before their lease was up, they didn't get their security deposits back and still owed money.   We're talking holes in the walls & ceilings Broken glass all over the floors. They had to sweep paths when people were coming over. They didn't know that neither of the stoves in their house were broken until 1/2 through the 2nd semester when I went over to bake for them. One of them was actually being used to store dirty dishes that they forgot about because they simply didn't feel like washing them. They can thank the neighbors for those brownies. If they wanted light in a room, they had to remove 1 of 2 light bulbs, find designated room and screw said bulb in. One time they thought it would be fun to break their dryer with a metal bat.  They graffitied their own house walls.  Weekly weekday keggers. Mon-Wed? Didn't matter. I got paid in beer to come over and clean/do dishes. One guy offered to pay me $50 if I would let him rub my feet. Several times after being denied. Burns all over carpets/wood floors. Broken heavy duty and wooden doors and frames. Forever broken toilets/sinks with all tons of dude hair in them/mold/soap dispensers were 97% water 3% soap. The basement wasn't level and the drain in the middle of the concrete floor was forever flooded with beer, bodily fluids, bleach, red solo cups, etc. (nick named the cesspool) and had a plank across it for fun. Because why not?  They threw a perfectly good flat screen tv off of the balcony into a fire (which weren't allowed in city limits).  Stabbing one another with broken glass bottles wasn't an uncommon past time.   I think you get the point. These boys were crazy. I think it's also safe to assume that girls typically were not hanging out at their place but they ALWAYS protected me and made sure I was safe. Anyway, at their house parties, instead of yelling ""social"" they would yell ""bukkake"" and everyone would drink. Except I was the only girl who would also yell it and slam. This was apparently hilarious to the guys and it stuck with me.   Nothing like hearing ""Hey, bukkake!"" on your walk to class and knowing that greeting is aimed for you. And that is the reason behind being nicknamed bukkake in college. A real story for the grand kids someday...  Edit: I can't spell & added to the bullet points"
progresspics,3ckqnc,zanpher717,6,Wed Jul 8 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"That is fantastic, my goodness.  I kind of love the idea of shouting ""bukkake!"" with the intent being to drink.  You're a hell of a sport.  And probably a little lucky to have survived that house without ending up with MRSA or tetanus.    I lived in a shithole near UWM (not by your standards, though) with this incredibly dank, disgusting basement in which we held all our parties.  One time my boss showed up out of the blue after hearing me discussing a CEO's and corporate hoes theme at work that day.  He actually showed up and said, ""I heard CEO's are welcome here.""  The guy even brought several of his successful friends who, upon seeing the state of my house, left after about 30 minutes.  I was pretty embarrassed but I can look back on that and laugh.

I never thought I'd be able to be okay with not drinking alcohol but if you told me I could never have another one I would be fine with that. The less I drank the less I craved it. Now when I crave a beer, which isn't often, if I don't have one, 20 minutes later it doesn't even sound that good anymore.

progresspics,3ckqnc,xSolcii,6,Fri Jul 10 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yup! It doesn't take into account many things, like body shape, muscle mass, body frame, etc.; only height and weight. Every body is different, what might be a healthy weight for someone could not be for someone else, even when they're the same height.  Now, if your BMI is like 14 or 50... well yeah, you're not healthy. But for numbers closer to the normal range it's different."

That takes a while to burn off and then you're only burning off the alcohol, not other food you've eaten throughout the day. If you know you'll be drinking then exercise and cut calories from food and try to stick to lower calorie options like a vodka soda"

progresspics,3cmz21,ApocryphalCanon,0,Thu Jul 9 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"I do in the post farther on. It's that while it's true, there are a number of things you can do to facilitate the loss. Doing just calories in > calories out I lost 5lbs from October to December. After making sure I was getting the right nutrients (I actually upped by caloric intake from 1000 to 1200) and drinking more water (because water facilitates weight loss) I dropped almost 100 from December to Now.   The formula is good in principal, but due to other factors, increasing calories consumed caused me to lose faster."
progresspics,3cmz21,SNl9ER,14,Thu Jul 9 08:57:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really understand calorie counting because someone of your size shouldn't have been eating only 1000 calories to begin with..  Calories in/out is the only thing that matters if you eat the proper amount.   According to the calculator your tdee is 3,492. The most safe recommended weight loss if I'm not mistaken is 2lbs per week which is a deficit of 1,000 per day. That means you should be eating ~2,492 calories a day right now. I've also heard 1% per week is fine which in your case would currently be around 3.5lbs or a 1,750 deficit per day which still says you should be eating ~1,742 calories per day."

Calories in/out is the only thing that matters if you eat the proper amount.   And THERES the point!  I didn't understand it. I just went for 1000 calories, because every time I mentioned it, people were like ""oh, just calories in < calories out, that's all you need to know"" so I'm like ""oh ok, then I'll just shoot for like, 4 250 calorie meals a day.""  I didn't research it at first, because SO MANY people just parroted that the ONLY thing I had to consider was calories in < calories out.   But you can't even advocate it without qualifying it with ""if you eat the proper amount.""   ""You don't know how this works""  No shit, because I listened to people who said ""Calories in/out is the only thing that matters"" without qualifying it. Every time someone tries to qualify that - which is ALL this post is - it's shot down.  Right now my diet is 1500 cal/day using some serious supplemental food. I also have blood work done regularly to monitor my levels because I'm eating so little. But I went for 2 months doing 1000 cal/day, lost all of 5lbs. Really fucked me up, too. Met with a weight loss doctor who scolded me and set me straight. Stepped me up to 1200 for 12 weeks and now I'm up to 1500 daily and doing awesome with it.  I understand it, now. But I imagine there are countless people like me who just hear ""oh, calories in < calories out is all I need to know? ok"" and don't bother researching. Yes it's my fault for not researching more first, but it's damnable to say that ONLY calories in < calories out matters - because that glosses over doing it healthily."

This was through a doctor's guidance and the dude lost like 250 pounds. So when someone goes on crazy restrictive diets, your body already has the stored calories you've saved up for years, but it still requires the nutrients. So when on a 1000 calorie diet if you are eating the right things you should be fine. If its 100% McDonalds, then you will likely lose weight but do extreme damage to other parts of your body, like for instance hormones, as jcamson said."

But if you're only eating 1200 calories a day at some point you may run into hormonal irregularities. Obviously if it's working for you, by all means stick with it. I would just strongly recommend keeping an eye on your hormones. It's so easy to let things get out of whack on a deficit and such a pain to get them fixed."

The OP may have been a bit brash in his articulation in regards to calories in/calories out, but his overall point is accurate. He may have been eating the incorrect things and just measuring calories in/out, which would lead to the body not running efficiently. But when he upped his numbers he also made the switch to foods that were effective for his systems as a whole, which in turn spurred weight loss at a much faster/accurate rate.

I've slowly cut everything bad for me in my life, and added foods that promote my goals much more naturally and organically.  My tenants (and oversimplifications) as of today... Protein takes longer to digest, making you feel fuller longer. It also aids in muscle growth and recovery. Fat is not the enemy in the right quantites in the right foods. Carbohydrates are the devil... not really but we don't need them in the quantites we eat today.

I didn't look 500 pounds, at my worst I prob looked 400, but thats because between my height and people not really understanding what that kind of wight looks like assumed I was much less.   We both seemed to start our diet, acquire knowledge, and almost create a scientifically grounded weight loss plan.

Previous to that, I was taking a summer class and then going to the gym after. So I was weightlifting about 2 days a week, plus cardio. I looked pretty damn good and my arms were the strongest they have ever been!   So then school started and it got colder and I didn't feel like walking to the gym. I kept eating my normal amount. I also turned 21 so drinking was a thing now. My old apartment was right across from a pizza place that had $5 pizzas on Tuesdays... Needless to say, a lot of bad food choices happened. At the end of January I put my foot down.   I downloaded FatSecret and Steps. These two apps have helped me so much! I generally stick to pretty low carb (50-100g/day) and try to go for jogs at least 3 times a week. I've had my slip ups, but I don't get too upset over them.   Bonus body pic (about 148-150lbs)"

I'm sure your hardwork over the last three years will continue to pay off - and if you need motivation you can look not just at the progress others have made but at your own progress and take heart from that. Good luck for the future and thanks for your contribution to progresspics!

progresspics,3cjq3z,nomorechubrub,6,Wed Jul 8 13:16:49 2015 UTC,"I got diagnosed with PCOS a month ago and I'm yet to be put on any medications for it. I decided that I HAD to lose weight about two weeks ago now, I'm already diabetic because of a mitochondrial mutation and enough was enough. I'm really similar stats to you and I hope to reach 150 too! (I've never been lower than 165 in my adult life) I've started using MFP and sticking to a 1200 calorie, no more than 100g carbs a day diet, and trying to run 3 days a week with a walk every day. Do far I've only lost 3lbs (only... I know 3lbs in 2 weeks is good but I was promised a large drop in the first month as I'm eating 800 calories under my maintenance). How did you go about losing? I'd love to know more details!"

progresspics,3cjq3z,apricotmuffins,2,Wed Jul 8 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"I use MFP too! I have it set to lost 1lb a week and I eat between 1500-1600 calories a day. I make it a point to log absolutely everything, every cup of coffee, even unsweetened ice tea. I've found that with PCOS, literally every calorie counts. I actually don't really track carbs, protein, etc. I'm extremely picky, so I focus on just the calorie count and keep whatever it is that I want within that.   I mentioned below that I weigh myself almost every day at this stage, and I average those weights to get my weight for the week to help account for bloating.  Medication (aldactone and metformin) really was a huge help for me. PCOS definitely screwed with my blood sugar, and I have trouble getting and staying satiated without medication. My goal is to be able to keep lowering my dosage as I lose weight, though.  I run between 1-3 times a week, for 1 to 2 miles, and walk as much as possible, at least 2-3 miles a day. I'm not a big gym person, I prefer just being outside."

progresspics,3cjq3z,jackie716,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"Getting on the right medication and dosage was a huge part of it for me. My doctor lowered my dosage after I lost some of the weight, which I definitely felt was an accomplishment.  My other suggestion is patience. Women with PCOS tend to have lower BMR than non-PCOS women of similar weight - this is one of the REAL exceptions to calories in, calories out, so weight loss is just going to be slower, even if you stick to the calorie limit you set. That said, it's slower, but not impossible.  PCOS also causes me to bloat like crazy, so I don't beat myself up about daily/weekly fluctuations (I weigh myself daily and then take an average for the week)."

progresspics,3clzlm,Ariodude,5,Thu Jul 9 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  At first, I limited myself to roughly 2100 calories per day. I couldn't exercise because I had torn my patellar tendons in both my knees (slight tears) so I needed to take some time off from running, squatting, etc.. Over the course of about 4 months, I dropped to around 235-240. After that, I started doing 1900 calories per day. My average day looked like this:  Breakfast: 6 egg whites, a link of chicken sausage, 1 cup of mixed spinach, peppers, onions, and a piece of cinnamon raisin toat.  Snack: ~200 cal protein bar  Lunch: Chicken breast, 1 cup quinoa, 1 cup vegetable  Snack: Protein shake (2 scoops protein and 2 cups almond milk)  Dinner: Lean protein (chicken, lean steak, salmon, pork tenderloin) with rice/potatoes and a small salad.  I started back at the gym at this point, 5 days a week, as follows:  Monday: half mile warm up, biceps and triceps workout (lots of supersets and dropsets), some ""fun"" cardio like battle ropes or something like that, and then abs.  Tuesday: half mile warm up, legs legs legs. Lots of squats, lunges, kettlebell swings, and box jumps. I would finish off with sprints, typically.  Thursday: half mile warm up, deadlifts, back extensions, barbell rows, t-bar rows, the like.  Friday: half mile warm up, bench press, other assorted accessory chest work (dumbbell incline and decline press, flys, explosive pushups).  Saturday: half mile warm up, and I alternated working the olympic lifts like clean and jerk and snatch and plyometrics, and sometimes did both. Mostly so that I could use the strength I was building and to keep myself explosive. Ended with cardio and abs.  On my days off, I typically did a little yoga and called it a day. I was pretty sore.  Since I dropped to 195, I started trying to build mass, and was sitting at 210 with almost all the weight gained as nice muscle mass (mostly through powerlifting and a lot of hypertrophy, with cardio being mostly sprints). I'm now working to cut to 180!  Thanks for your comment :)"

progresspics,3chcnc,wosslogic,4,Wed Jul 8 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Honestly, I just started doing more physical activity. Nothing rigorous, but I started walking more and took the stairs way more often. I stopped sitting on my butt all the time! I also made my portion sizes smaller and didn't eat as much sugar or gluten. Lots of veggies and protein! Diets were annoying to me, so I just looked at it as a way of life and didn't stop myself from having pizza or ice cream every once in a while. It wasn't necessarily a quick process all the time, but it's been worth it!"

progresspics,3cht16,WyattManCanJump,3,Wed Jul 8 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"I started going to a kickboxing class twice a week and lifting on the other weekdays. I try to stay active on the weekends and will usually go on a long hike or kayak trip.   I stopped looking at eating as a competitive activity. It's ok if I don't eat an entire pizza in one sitting. I have come to terms with this.  Right now I'm focused on bulking up my traps, losing more back and belly fat, and getting my cardio in check. I get a really painful stitch in my right side every time I try to push my limits with cardio. Has anyone come across a good way of addressing stitches? I increased my potassium and electrolyte intake, but I still get them."
progresspics,3cht16,RisingUp73,2,Wed Jul 8 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"Your side stitch is most likely a spasm in your diaphragm (scientists still can't decide 100%). I used to get them as a runner if I suddenly increased my distance or pace, ate a larger meal before exercising and when I had weaker core muscles.  Electrolytes won't help in this case, Google how to manage side stitches, I know there are some good articles out there. I always put my hands on top of my head to lift some of the weight off my abdomen and that helped."
progresspics,3cht16,thankyouforfu,2,Wed Jul 8 03:14:06 2015 UTC,That is solid advice. I definitely notice that it happens most often when I increase intensity.
progresspics,3cht16,thankyouforfu,2,Wed Jul 8 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"I would recommend not ""pushing your limits"" with cardio.  Research has found that fat loss is best at about 60-75% your max heart rate. Considering your age, you'd burn the most calories at around 130-150 bpm. If you ""push"" it, you'll be up at 150-160, which is overdoing it a bit.  The best cardio you can do is HIIT & walking uphill on the treadmill, and if you have to be careful with your knees or whatnot, I recommend using an elliptical or recumbent bike."
progresspics,3cht16,sfall,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"I do the elliptical every now and then, but my main cardio comes from a 45 minute kickboxing class. It's usually a 400-500 calorie burn, and it's interval-based. I love it. I tend to get bored running in place. You're absolutely right about the knees. They already pop like crazy. I'll keep a closer eye on my heart rate and work on staying in that zone. Thanks!"

Then we did endurance weight training, wide standard narrow push ups, crunches, burpees, calf raises, jumping Jacks, squats, barrel Rolls etc. But the most important thing imo was the food. Once I started exercising, I found myself having a lower appetite. Ull soon realize that ur stomach has shrunk and ur capacity for food decreases by leaps and bounds.

Diet I just counted calories and high protein, and chocolate milk :).(no sodas and rarely drank alcohol) I am now officially the lightest of light weights!  For me if i was stalling a lift, I'd go down in weight and higher rep. My motivation is rather personal benefit of looking good naked, and another reason(family thing). Stats wise i'm pretty weak.   135x5(bench switched to dumbells) New gym../ 195x5(squat)/ 160x8(deadlift) Can't deadlift at new gym :(  If you see a body part that is lacking behind try to focus one or two exercises on it to add on to your routine. Don't however let others unless his a huge hulk tell you that you're on steroids!(this delayed me like a good 5 months)"

Do pull ups and chin ups, brah.  That will really widen your back up.  Your muscle imbalances should correct themselves if you keep doing compound exercises.  Barbell curls and dips should fix them, instead of doing isolated exercises per arm.  Or you could just do isolated exercises on the one arm for a week or two but I think compound exercises should balance your arms."

progresspics,3cexum,kymosabei,3,Tue Jul 7 13:54:46 2015 UTC,1) eat less
progresspics,3cexum,Ian_Dess,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"On that already. Been at a daily deficit for about two weeks now, just trying to get into a routine of portion and calorie control.  *Edit: I was mainly just looking for the other things he did on top of that."
progresspics,3cexum,kymosabei,-1,Tue Jul 7 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"1.) Start counting your calories and macros [fat, protein, carbs] on www.myfitnesspal.com if you aren't already.  2.) Cut down the carbs immediately -- stick to vegetables and fruits and try to keep carbs under 75 a day and shoot for 50 (/r/keto suggest you eat less than 20 net carbs a day, but /r/paleo allows you to eat more). Try to eat more protein, about .8 grams per lean body pound (or roughly 3/5 of your total weight). If you weight 200, eat about 120-130 grams of protein a day.  3.) Lift weights and do 4-6 hours of cardio a week. Walk after dinner, go to the gym and do the elliptical, whatever. Just start moving.  4.) Cut out all sugary drinks, period. Drink a ton of water.  I have no idea what your deficit is, but assuming you're a man under 6ft tall, you should be eating less than 1800 calories a day if you're more than 30 pounds overweight. That's plenty of food at first. As you lose weight, slowly lower your caloric intake to continue losing weight. A ton of people have lost weight and stayed healthy by only eating 1500 calories a day. Nonetheless, don't starve yourself, as this is a slow process that is a lifestyle change."
progresspics,3cexum,thankyouforfu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:51:15 2015 UTC,"MFP has me at 1,540 calories a day. I've managed to stay under that consistently not counting my first cheat day test last Saturday (which ended poorly and made Sunday a battle against eating).  I'm averaging 89.2 carbs a day, and 100.4g's of protein. Is watching that strictly going to make a massive impact?  I've also started a C25K program, and I'm on the third week. I had surgery a few months ago on my knee, so I don't know if I can do 4-6 hours of cardio a week."
progresspics,3cexum,kymosabei,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:34:35 2015 UTC,What kind of carbs are you eating? How much sugar are you consuming? How much fiber?  Protein helps build muscle and lose weight. I'd eat 20-30 grams more protein a day at the expense of carbs. You should eat roughly twice as much protein as carbs.   Ride a recumbent bike -- they're easy on the knees.
progresspics,3cexum,thankyouforfu,2,Tue Jul 7 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"What kind of carbs are you eating? How much sugar are you consuming? How much fiber?   I have a whole wheat tortilla wrap thing for lunch, then it looks like snack stuff (Boulder Olive Oil potato chips, which I no longer purchase); other than that, carbs are just coming from Broccoli really. Sugar is on average lower than 32g's. I think it's mostly from my yogurt.  Fiber is averaging 15-17g's (lunch and dinner, so broccoli and that wheat tortilla)."
progresspics,3cexum,kymosabei,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"Cut back the chips and yogurt, replace them with fruit.   And you'd have to eat 18 servings of broccoli to get the carbs you eat per day, so it's not broccoli doing it. It's the other junk.   Also, look for low carb tortillas instead.   Honestly, I'd cut carbs down to 60 or less a day. As I've already pointed out, you're probably not eating enough protein.   Nonetheless, make sure you're counting every single thing you put in your body. If you're truly only eating 1500 cals a day, you should average 1.5 pounds lost per week over your deficit."
progresspics,3cexum,thankyouforfu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I only eat one yogurt for lunch with the wrap thing (they're in individual small containers). Is that an acceptable amount? (I really enjoy it's addition to my lunch) :D"
progresspics,3cexum,kymosabei,0,Wed Jul 8 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's totally acceptable.  But again, you're eating 90 carbs a day.   20 or so for yogurt 20 or so for tortilla 20 for 4 servings of broccoli   That's only 60. You're still eating another 30 on average. And if your yogurt or tortilla is more than 20, look for a different brand.  You asked what the secret was, I shared it. If you're eating 1800 calories or less, you'll lose weight. If you aren't losing weight, you aren't being honest with yourself about what you're putting in your body. If you're just starting out, give it time, because you didn't gain all that weight in 1 month.  And what's with the fucking downvotes???"
progresspics,3cexum,thankyouforfu,2,Wed Jul 8 02:18:43 2015 UTC,"Of course! I'll be honest and say the biggest change I made was my diet. When I decided I wanted to lose weight, I stopped eating fried stuff and sweets. No kidding, for like 8 weeks, I ate: banana for breakfast, baked chicken on honey wheat bread for lunch, and baked chicken with fresh boiled green beans for dinner. I got a scale and made 6 oz of chicken, 3 for dinner and 3 for lunch the next day, and 2-3 oz of green beans. I eventually let myself have foods like hamburgers, fries, fried chicken, etc., but in moderation, usually twice a week at most. I cut out sodas and other sugary drinks, but I kept my coffee because coffee is life, I just stopped getting super fancy drinks and stuck with regular coffee with some cream and sugar (hot or iced).   Of course, I did develop a workout routine eventually. Started out easy, taking on the elliptical for 15-25 minutes. Doing some light work on machines and Dumbbells. But nowadays, I'm running 2 days a week and lifting at least 3. I go for runs in the neighborhood. I started out using the Couch to 5K app, which helped a lot, but now I use Runkeeper because it allows me more flexibility. I do the 5x5 workout in the gym, alternating between squats/bench/incline/forearms/bent over row and squats/calf workout/leg extensions/leg curls/arm curls/tricep workout. I always make sure to do squats no matter what.   I also ended up finding various ab exercises and creating a workout out of them. I do this 2 or 3 times a week. I don't know the names of all the exercises off the top of my head, but I'll figure them out tonight and let you know."
