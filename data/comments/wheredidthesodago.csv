wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,SwissArmsDude,50,Fri Jul 17 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"Because the energy isn't transferred thermally, it's transferred electromagnetically. A convection burner has a heating element. Electricity is applied to the heating element, which then generates heat via resistive losses as current passes through it. The heat then radiates from the element to the pan.  Induction heating uses very strong, very quickly changing magnetic fields. There is a large coil of wire under the ceramic stovetop. A large amount of electricity is applied to this coil at a high frequency. The current through the coil creates a magnetic field, which couples to the pan. The rapidly changing magnetic field creates rapidly changing electric currents in the metal pan (I'm sure you remember learning, or at least hearing about, Maxwell's Equations in highschool math or physics; this is a major application). These currents then cause the pan to heat up just like a heating element."

wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,grem75,14,Fri Jul 17 13:35:13 2015 UTC,A traditional electric stove is putting a large amount of electricity into a big resistor radiating heat in all directions and some of it is making it into your pan. Induction makes your pan the heating element.
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,moshisimo,4,Fri Jul 17 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking as opposed to a gas stove... But that's interesting. If you were to put them in order of efficiency, what would that be like?"
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,theforkofdamocles,7,Fri Jul 17 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"One source I checked tested efficiency: Gas = 40%, Electric = 74%, Induction = 84%.  Gas is typically much cheaper than electicity, but unless one is cooking many hours per day, most commenters say the difference in usage cost is negligible.  The initial cost for induction is often higher for the stove and due to high electrical draw setup and maybe getting more appropriate cookware, but many folks really love the efficiency factor (faster cook times, not as much heat in your kitchen) and the safety. I'm sold on induction for my next stove."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,moshisimo,5,Fri Jul 17 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not in the US, let me explain why I'm asking. Our gas prices are somewhat high and they increase every so often, a few times a year. Electricity prices are way more stable but we get charged by brackets. If you spend less than some amount of electricity a month, you get charged a certain amount of money per KW. If you exceed that amount you go into the next bracket and you then pay more per KW. There's a few brackets, by the way, not only two. So, if you spend just enough electricity to stay under a bracket limit this month but just barely over the limit the next, you're gonna notice a pretty steep difference in price.    What I'm curious about is if induction is efficient enough to make daily cooking not so much of an issue in terms of KW usage to account for when measuring electricity usage. I mean, I KNOW it's going to use electricity, I would like to know approximately how much, say, in average.    That made a lot more sense in my head. I hope it didn't come out all ramble-y."

In the store I worked at induction ranges (including oven and sometimes hood) started at like $1000 which was close to ten times as expensive as the low end ranges."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Fremen13,4,Fri Jul 17 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Wow. I've only seen gas stoves in pictures. Here everyone uses hotplates, and induction is becoming more and more common."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Stompedyourhousewith,7,Fri Jul 17 15:04:50 2015 UTC,The standard American household buys a range.  Different strokes for different folks?    I'm not sure on the reasons why we don't do the hot plate thing.
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Fremen13,3,Fri Jul 17 15:14:27 2015 UTC,Hot plates as in an electric range.  I think the main difference is that there aren't many houses with access to gas in Denmark. A gas range is pretty shit if you have to transport the gas yourself.
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Hellointhere,4,Fri Jul 17 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Oh haha, never heard that terminology used like that before.  Hot plates in America exclusively refer to tabletop devices.  Thanks for the knowledge!"
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Fremen13,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"induction ranges, like the full blown counter top ones, are very rare (edit back in the day). on home depot us, they only sell gas, electric, and hybrid stove ovens have 9 induction ranges. induction devices in america are usually only hot plate style."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Hellointhere,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:44 2015 UTC,I worked Appliances at Lowes a couple years ago for a summer job and we sold 3-4 different induction range models.  I actually managed to sell 2 of them using those fun pamphlets and magnets too.
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,Boxpopper,2,Fri Jul 17 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"No, electric uses more energy than induction.  When I was researching induction, most of the converts were from gas, as I am."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,guinness_blaine,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the upfront costs of the range.  The average gas range could be like $200-500, and electric would be slightly higher.  All of our induction ranges were $1000+, not even the same ballpark.  For us, induction was a luxury technology like double oven or 8 heating elements with variable sizes and wattage.    This would suggest a really long payback period IMO given electric and gas prices."
wheredidthesodago,3dm3bm,_HarleyQuinn_,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, it was expensive. But I like to cook and it was important to me so I was willing to spend a lot in induction.  You can buy single Hobs on Amazon that are much less expensive. I tried a Nuwave before I bought the cooktop. They are on Amazon for $60.00 to $150.00."

Also, I'm not a fan of letting the dog have his/her entire leash. I usually have the handle on my left wrist and control the slack with my right hand.

ACME, of course, is the brand of products Wily Coyote uses in the Roadrunner shorts, hence the reference to Looney Tunes, so it makes a little more sense than ""act mean.""  Then again, as I'm typing it out now, it's more likely he says ""act me"" and relies on the listener to hear ""ACME"" to make the reference work, but putting it in text that way wouldn't have made much sense to someone reading it."

More social support and better access to contraception for people who don't want kids—which is what the sub's all about—would prevent a lot of infanticide/child murder cases. Did redditors just assume that /r/childfree had somehow given the guy murder tips?

I use to go on it all the time because I felt very alone in a lot of ways in my life.  It helped at least that I wasn't the only person who doesn't want kids.  There was just a huge threat on /r/relationships about this guy who's wife tried ti give their kids up for adoption and how she told him when they met that she didn't really want kids.  People go on and on about how it's ""different when they're your own"" but if being biologically related is the reason people love their kids I want no part in that.   Maybe it is different when they're your own.  Maybe for you.  But maybe not for me.  I'm not taking any chances because that would mean gambling over a child's happiness.  Sorry for the rant but this just gets me."
wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,Error404-,2,Thu Jul 9 20:56:16 2015 UTC,It's because of the hostility the /r/childfree community has towards people who choose to be parents and to their children. Don't want children? Fine. Don't call other people's kids crotch droppings.

The best part was that the wife called for medical help before the husband ""discovered"" what had happened and called her. Surveillance cameras also showed him going out to check inside his car several times during the day.  Apparently, police found he was browsing /r/childfree just prior to the incident, and had the subreddit locked as evidence. It was down about a week, I think.  Now, /r/childfree would never suggest actually harming a child.

There was some of that, but for the most part it was a circlejerk of how children (and parents) are all awful. And some of the members were just downright toxic. Fuck that community."
wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,killswithspoon,91,Thu Jul 9 23:58:35 2015 UTC,I agree it is about 50/50 but I can understand the need to have a place you can circlejerk. Where else can they do that? Most of the population feels that having children is their sole purpose in life and its what give meaning to their existence. When you say no I don't agree the reactions can be simple to downright nasty. I think this is where the atheism and childfree groups draw very similar parallels. There are quite a large number of people who are openly hostile against those who do not believe in a higher power. Just as there are those that are openly hostile against people who chose not to have children. So for these two groups to be hostile in return isn't surprising.
wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,oneofmywhitefriends,235,Thu Jul 9 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"/r/childfree is to not wanting kids as /r/atheism is to not believing in God(s).

Say you don't want to have children?  ""They're different when they're your own, you'll regret it if you don't have them, you'll change your mind..""  It goes on.  Most of /r/childfree I feel is just venting frustrations to people who also don't want children and understand the criticism they face daily on the matter.   I know a lot of people think it's just all about hate... but it's mostly just an /r/offmychest for people who don't want kids."

wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,BaadKitteh,20,Thu Jul 9 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to what she is saying, I am woman in my 30s. I have literally had other women and men tell me I should just kill myself since I chose not to have children, because I took all meaning/worth out of my life when I made that choice. While this is on the extreme end of things and not as common, its happened to me a handful of times when it shouldn't have happened at all.  I more often just get people telling me how broken I am, how they feel so sorry for someone as damaged as me, and how they wonder what must have happened to me to mess me up so much in the head.  When my husband was in the military, and his ""friends"" found out I was childfree, they tried to convince him to divorce me and find a better woman. They tried to tell him that he was wasting his time with someone like me and he needed to find someone willing to give him children or he would regret it. He too is childfree and of course stuck up for me, but the fact that people have to audacity to be that way still hurts.  I know people who have been disowned by their entire families because they didn't have children. Hell, most of my family has disowned me and written me off as a lost cause because I chose not to (they are some of the people who have called me broken, one of my older cousins was one of the people who told me I might as well kill myself when she found out I got sterilized), only my mother and one of my aunts still speak to me.  The sub is a huge fucking circlejerk, but that is really okay to me. Its a place where we can commiserate, vent, bitch, complain and just get rid of these frustrations we have to deal with silently day to day, because we can't talk to most other people about it. To most people children are sacred and anyone who dares speak a negative word in regards to them is a monster and gets treated as such, and most people seem to take ""I don't want children"" as an insult to them."

wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,oneofmywhitefriends,18,Thu Jul 9 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"Not to say this as an attack against you, just that from my perspective it absolutely should be a legitimate movement, not just a private belief. The reasons I believe that are several: I believe that as a society, we really don't think critically about following the conventional path as much as we should.   There is a serious overpopulation issue in the world which is causing a drain on natural resources, particularly non-renewable ones. This is especially true in poor and unstable nations.  There is a macro economic issue: Who is going to employ all of these extra people, in a world where jobs are increasingly being mechanized? Are we creating a whole generation of people who will end up out of work and on welfare?   There are financial consequences to families having more kids than they can afford (even 1, for people who are very poor), leading to long term poverty, and potentially resorting to crime to make ends meet.   There are, especially important, social harms that are committed by bad, abusive, and neglectful parents; parents whom society would be better off if they chose not to have kids. [""Chose"" is the key word here. I'm not advocating sterilization or anything crazy like that!]  And then there are a lot of people who simply don't really want kids, but they have them anyway because of societal pressure. This type of pressure is sexist (it disproportionately burdens women), overbearing, and irresponsible, and it needs to stop: Think about it, if a person isn't absolutely ready and willing to have kids, they probably aren't ready for the responsibilities of parenthood, are they? And what about the interests of the children--don't kids deserve parents who are very loving and happy, rather than parents who are distant or resentful because they weren't able to pursue their own dreams?   Sorry for the long rant, but I think if people thought a little more about the consequences of reproducing without careful thought and long term planning, we would all be better off."
wheredidthesodago,3cpa9q,doofbaron,4,Thu Jul 9 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that people should be absolutely sure that they are the ones who want a child (not society wanting them to have a child) and furthermore that they absolutely want to take care of that child.   I'm not advocating that people should just have as many kids as possible without even considering it twice - that's stupid. People should be prepared to be good, loving parents and if they think they can't rise to the standard then they simply shouldn't have children (even if they may want them).  I am just saying that I fail to see the point of a sub like /r/childfree. All it is is people who don't have or want children complaining about the fact that they are, we have to admit, the minority in this world and that a lot of other people have children and are happy about it. Yes, a lot of parents can be annoying with their constant talk about their new baby or their little princess or how one of them is expecting. So just don't listen to them. There's people out there who just won't shut up about their cars or how awesome their job is, that sort of behavior isn't necessarily a ""parent thing"". Personally I'd much rather hear about a unique little person than a mass-produced hunk of metal that rolls around on wheels.

If you can't talk to the people around you because they're telling you ""you'll change your mind, don't be silly"", the sub can be a nice safe haven with like-minded people.  Some of the lingo on there is cringeworthy though- I have to stop reading posts when they talk about ""demon spawn"" and ""crotchfruit""!

Not even sure when (or if?) PC games were 64-bit to this day. My OS is 64-bit but when I rarely pay attention I still notice a lot of apps running 32-bit.  The biggest difference I can think of would be whether the game's process could reserve more than 2GB of RAM to itself. Even then there are some OS/programming tricks to eke out some more.
wheredidthesodago,3c75za,mrbooze,5,Mon Jul 6 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Most new games now a days actually are 64 bit but it's only been very recently that that's happened because most games didn't need more than 2gb of ram until the last 5 years.

wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,Psychedelic_Roc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Too busy fighting over the Euro, then"
wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,IAMA_Ghost_Boo,83,Sun Jul 5 05:33:33 2015 UTC,Sometimes I accidentally rip off a misshapen piece of paper towel. But not knowing how to rip it at all? What the heck. I need to see this product...  Edit: I see. A paper towel holder that magically increases the perforation between paper towel squares so that you don't even have to try to rip it. They just come off when you pull it straight forward. Somehow.
wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,Psychedelic_Roc,50,Sat Jul 4 15:14:32 2015 UTC,it looks like it just creates tension on the roll when you pull a piece. After a piece is ripped off the roll rebounds. At least that's what I gathered from the 480p video OP linked.
wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,IAMA_Ghost_Boo,19,Sat Jul 4 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that made it hard to grab a piece in the first place though? Like it wouldn't roll and you'd end up ripping in the middle of the piece, and then have to grab the roll and turn it manually to get more? My paper towel holder has gotten annoying like that before."
wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,TheLittleGoodWolf,10,Sat Jul 4 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"I thought about that too but they only show the people pulling one piece in the video, that's how they get you!"
wheredidthesodago,3c3vt3,EdibleVelvet,10,Sat Jul 4 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"I would assume the roll is meant to go just far enough to give you one piece and then break giving you resistance to rip off the piece. After you rip it off there is tension on the roll that pushes it back to it's original position enabling you to grab another piece if you want to.  There are a number of problems that can come from this, especially towards the end of the paper roll, but I wouldn't expect any less from a product like this."

It was pretty. With the first potato, I was left feeling a little unsatisfied. It was an anti-climax moment for me. Thankfully he made up for it by putting in a little more oomph into smashing the second potato.   I felt that smashing the third potato was unnecessary, I was satisfied enough with the second potato smashing however, others may not be and need to see that third potato smash to get their kicks, some may have even preferred to see a forth smashed potato but unfortunately the creators of the video made the decision not to add a forth potato.   This decision didn't come lightly though, a team of experts were brought in to help decide how many potatoes should be used for this video. The team of experts argued for days, several members of the team were members of the organisation PETP -People for the Ethical Treatment of Potatoes. They believed that the potatoes were being treated unfairly and wanted to withdraw all potatoes from the video.   This didn't go down to well with the other members of the team who believed that since the potatoes were being financially compensated for their time, they weren't being treated unfairly.   Originally the creators of the video wanted to have as many as 100 potato smashings in one scene. Those of the experts who were members of PETP fought long and hard for their cause, negotiating their way from 100 potato smashings down to three potato smashings. Despite having saved 97 potatoes from being smashed, the members of PETP still mourn the three that didn't make it.   ""I just wish that I could have done more. I wish that I could have saved them all. It's hard to celebrate for the potatoes that we saved when there were three that didn't make it."" -(Name withheld) One of the members of PETP who was brought in to be part of the decision making process.   The members of PETP have a long and hard battle ahead of them but they won't give up until they achieve their goal.    ""We want to save every single potato. We want to live in a world where no potato shall suffer. We want our children to grow up knowing that potatoes have rights, and they need to respect them!"""

I have two, 4 year old black male, 1 year old white female. They are insane about the water, they are not even scared of the sea, not even of the brave Atlantic in the dead of winter. The little girl gets scared if the waves are too high sometimes, so she tries to climb on top of the big guy (he lets her, he's a fucking gentleman, then swims to shore with her jammed sideways on his back). If he goes with her, or he swims alone and I'm waiting on the shore, he rarely goes more than 30 or 40 meters into the water, but in the summer when I swim with him, we just keep going in until we can barely see the shore anymore.   As soon as he sees any body of water, be it pool, lake, or the ocean, he just ignores everything else and makes a beeline for it, even if its below freezing.   He doesn't like the rain though, or storms."

This stage is characterized by a high degree of conformity and concern for peer approval as the individual attempts to form a personal identity by mimicking others and receiving feedback.  So, ""everyone will hate you and you'll be uncool if you don't..."" is very persuasive to a teenager in a way that it is not to an adult."

wheredidthesodago,3b3uyg,liemaid,3,Sun Jul 5 11:38:08 2015 UTC,"Erickson's stages are not always super distinct or clear-cut.  A person can be working on multiple stages at a time or can revisit previously completed stages at a later date, and outcomes from previous stages can influence how a person experiences later ones.  For instance, the next stage, Intimacy vs. Isolation, is commonly being explored by adolescents even as they work on Identity vs. Role Confusion.  It is possible that you moved through this stage faster than your peers, but it is also possible that you are misidentifying who your peers are.  ""Idgaf"" is a common role for adolescents to assume in their explorations of different roles.  It's been a core part of adolescence basically forever.  Non-comformity has a tendency to develop its own kind of conformity.  ""Peers"" doesn't mean everyone the same age in this context.  It means the people from whom the adolescent is modeling behaviors and attitudes and with whom the adolescent identifies.  Few adolescents don't pay attention to the opinions of those people."

In Boondock Saints though, it's ridiculous to pretend that we're supposed to do anything other than sympathize and agree with the ""saints."" Even when they're killing guys about whom we really know nothing or whether they deserve it, it's brushed over and we're not supposed to ask that sort of question.  It's actually very deceptive, especially at the end, the way the movie tries to frame the question as, ""Is it okay to kill complete scumbags?"" which is lol self-answering rhetorical masturbatory bullshit, when the real question is; who are the scumbags?  I mean this is most obvious in the climax where literally the only reason these guys don't kill each other is an unreal dumb plot device revealing that they're family (as if that automatically means now they're not scumbags- contrast this with a truly great work of violent cinema like Desperado for instance.)"

If it was nitrogen or something intert sure, and hopefully they'd return to breath normally after a loss of confusions with only a few dead brain cells but that's not how these work.  To compress a larger volume of gas easier, at least the can I have, uses difluoroethane (a refrigerant).  The gas being absorbed through the lunges into the bloodstream can cause a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. When the gas expands the temperature rapidly decreases which can also cause frostbite.

wheredidthesodago,3a6725,Biffmcgee,2,Thu Jun 18 08:53:39 2015 UTC,It's probably just a normal shirt they're having made that's been treated with something like Neverwet DWR or similar product.  Probably a more industrial type version that you wouldn't normally trust people to be able to apply themselves.  Otherwise I don't see how they'd get the hydrophilic coating to stay on after being washed.
wheredidthesodago,3a6725,BottingWorks,5,Thu Jun 18 11:12:02 2015 UTC,"Nope their kickstarter claims they've processed the fibers to create nano-textured fibrils which create an inherently superhydrophobic textile, no coating necessary. No commercial superhydrophobic  coating I know of is really durable enough to survive long term use on a fabric. I'm very interested in how the process works but obviously they're keeping it secret.   EDIT: the description is deliberately really vague. It sounds like it could be some kind of chemical vapor deposition since they're talking about it being ""applied at the molecular level""."
wheredidthesodago,3a6725,BottingWorks,4,Thu Jul 2 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"Can't help but feel like if they really invented such a thing, they'd be making billions licensing it to companies making breathable rain jackets, rather than selling shirts on kickstarter."

Dishes like this, a filet of beef with some kind of pâté or duxelles on top and then wrapped in pastry, were popular in continental Europe from the 1600's on; some folks believe it may have been a rebranding of a dish... Not unlike French fries/freedom fries, but I believe that dish was named for the duke of Wellington.  And based on ngram and other sources, it was very recent.. This is almost like spaghetti carbonara's muddied origin story. Anyways, there's that.  Edit: this is blowing my mind, this is the word usage for pâté compared with beefwellington - that 10 year pulse of popularity? Do people love it then feel guilty for a couple years?

The friction in between the small gap between the car seat and console is clipped in, this means that it doesn't provide movement, and the cup holders have almost no mass, because you need an object to move if you have mass. How did this make me a cup holder enthusiast? Well, long story sort I don't have a lot of room in my car, buying an additional car and strapping it on top of my car is far too expensive, so I buy additional cup holders to place into my stuff. In fact, I don't need to buy backpacks anymore, I just buy cup holders and stick then together, because of what I previously mentioned. Since they have almost no mass, those objects are essentially not in motion, in case if you have cups in your the cup holders the cups won't move.   Note: I am in no way am expert in cup holders, I only collect them for hobby purposes. If you feel that I have misinformed in some way, then please let me know."

Everything else is free for all.  I've seen a line of ten busses completely ignore the laws saying you must come to a complete stop before exiting a parking lot for traffic that has the right of way, and stop and block both lanes of the road to get where they're going.  They will block intersections.  They'll ignore yield signs.  They ignore the fact that legally they have to give the driver on the right right-of-way at unmarked intersections.    They basically go as and when they please because how can your shitbox fight a bus in a crash, and fuck the kids inside.  We do what we want.  ""/r/bitchimabus...""  But they never speed, that's for sure.  I got into a car wreak once that was entirely my fault, and ever since then I've been a very defensive driver, and I can't even tell you how many times I've almost nailed a bus with my kids in the car, that didn't obey a traffic law, and when you lay on your horn and flip them the bird because you reactively are freaking out, the bus driver will just look at you like, ""Pfft!  Bitch, I'm a bus"".  I had a co-worker who used to work driving a school bus, and when I told him their fuckig insane, he basically said ""If we ain't speeding we won't get pulled over and lose our jobs.  We got a schedule to keep, and it gets more and more unreasonable every year, and everyone is gonna stop before they hit a bus."""

The medical term is a dilator or sound and can be purchased on Amazon. Sterilize sounds with soap and water and then rinse with alcohol prior to every use Use ""Surgilube"" individual size lube.  It must be sterile - you should not use any other type of sex lube or spit Use disposable gauze cloths to carry or lay instruments on.  If you bother with all of the sterilization steps and drop in on the bed you need to start over. Take a shower immediately prior.   The goal of this process is to ensure sterility.  Sounding involves inserting a foreign object into an orifice that hasn't evolved for such activity and is prone to infection.  EDIT - few people PM'd asking for recommendations.  Beginners should stick with straight stainless steel one piece instruments.  Don't use curved J-shape or composite (with plastic tube or beads) as these can cause injury or risk leaving pieces inside you!"

wheredidthesodago,38e3wq,autowikibot,2,Thu Jun 4 03:39:35 2015 UTC,"Flehmen response:       The flehmen response (/ˈfleɪmən/; German: [ˈfleːmən]), also called the flehmen position, flehmen reaction, flehming, or flehmening, is a behaviour whereby an animal curls back its upper lips exposing its front teeth, inhales with the nostrils usually closed and then often holds this position for several seconds. It may be performed over a site or substance of particular interest to the animal (e.g. urine or faeces) or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals including ungulates and felids. The behaviour facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.

wheredidthesodago,38fqvq,startacker,60,Wed Jun 3 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"Item #: SCP-3658  Object Class: Euclid  Special Containment Procedures: Item SCP-3658 is to be kept in open kitchenware container of metal and submerged in boiling water, changed out every 4-6 hours. Carriage of SCP-3658 will require special nanocarbon oven mitts; under no circumstances is it to be touched directly except in the cases of experimentation with Class D or Class E personnel.  Description: Object is a species of organism assuming the appearance of a clump of pasta, each strand approximately 3 mm in thickness, and 200 mm in length. No organs or sensory nerves have been found in individuals, but when coalesced the hive appears to acquire basic navigational skills and even problem solving capabilities. Individuals die within 1-4 minutes when isolated, but when in a hive they become much more resilient. When in hive form, the temperature of the body becomes over 200°C in the vicinity of other lifeforms.  When in hive form, Class D and E personnel have reported burns through protective clothing - these burns eventually spread and take on the form of SCP-3658 within 3 hours, consuming the body. When observed, Dr. ███████ and Dr. █████ noted a ""strange discoloration... as if the surroundings have lost their color."" A link between this manipulation of light and SCP-3658 has been documented, but causation has failed to been uncovered."

Remember the episode of Family Guy where someone finds Lois' old porno? ""Well, I mean you gotta say you made porn or you made a porno. You don't say ""made a porn,"" it hits the ear wrong.""

wheredidthesodago,389sdt,ThresholdLurker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:07:54 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure how they made that segment.  The water flowing out of the bucket looks like it's coming from a fire hose.
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,FishWash,39,Thu Jun 4 01:22:19 2015 UTC,I think they used physics.
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,simcop2387,12,Tue Jun 2 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"water's heavy, there's a lot of pressure making it come out fast"
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,critically_damped,-12,Tue Jun 2 21:57:55 2015 UTC,Based on my own experience with 5 gallon buckets there wouldn't be enough pressure.  I'm guessing they hid a hose somewhere.
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,jnh14,5,Tue Jun 2 22:28:29 2015 UTC,"Sigh.    Bernoulli's principle says that the sum of the potential and kinetic energies per unit volume plus the pressure is a constant everywhere in the fluid.  Taking points at the top of the bucket, and at the hole itself, the pressure is the same (1 atmosphere), so we get (with h==0 at the hole)  (top of bucket) = (outside hole) d*g*h+(1/2)*d*v1^2 +P =  (1/2)*d*v2^2 + P v2^2 = v1^2 + 2*g*h   (*)  where d is the density of the fluid, and v1 is the rate at which the top water line drops, and v2 is the speed which water flows out of the hole, and h is the distance from the hole to the top of the bucket.  By continuity, v1 and v2 are related to the diameters of the bucket and the hole (d1 and d2) by  v1*A1 = v2*A2 v1*pi*(d1/2)^2 = v2*pi*(d2/2)^2 ==>  v1 = (d2/d1)^2*v2  Since the hole diameter d2 is approximately 1/10 the diameter of the bucket d2, we can say that v1 ~ 0.01*v2, and ignore it entirely in (*).  With this, we have   v2 = sqrt(2*g*h)  If the hole is 30 cm (~1 foot) below the water line, then this well be   v2 = sqrt(2*10 m/s2 * 0.3 m) ~ 2.4 m/s.  If the hole is only 10 cm above the bottom of the bucket, then it will fall for a time of   t = sqrt(2*y/g) = sqrt(2*0.1m/10m/s^2)~ .14 seconds  and so will travel a distance of 0.14*2.4 ~ .4 meters before it reaches the level of the bottom of the bucket.    It doesn't look like it shoots quite that far in the video, but it does go quite a ways.  My calculation assumed a completely full bucket, and it's pretty apparent from the video that it's not completely full.  But it should be apparent that the water pressure alone is enough to shoot the water out at the speed you see.  Edits for clarity, and because I arithmetiked wrong the first time."
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,ThisIs_MyName,5,Tue Jun 2 23:11:10 2015 UTC,v2 = sqrt(2*g*h)   Heh. Sqrt.
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,critically_damped,2,Wed Jun 3 03:07:24 2015 UTC,So...does this take into account viscosity? I'm sure that the actual flow rate should be lower than your calculation.
wheredidthesodago,389sdt,ThisIs_MyName,2,Wed Jun 3 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Water's not a very viscous material, and including viscosity won't change my answer enough to effect the 1 significant digit estimate."

Then later that night you have sex, and your pillow ends up back there again (from sex) and the sex pillow cycle starts all over again.  Did I mention I have sex?"

It just seems like a whole lot of effort to solve something that most people don't seem to have an issue with (swiping/tapping to pay).  Personally the issue I have with any new payment methods are the chances that someplace I go will even support it. I know 99% of places will just support good old card swiping. If I try to use my phone to pay, or now this ""Hands Free"" method, by the time a few stores have trouble processing said payments, I've pretty much negated any time saved by it.  This is why I still just stick to swiping a card... even though plenty of new tech seems neat."

If you get a smell in your sink it's usually from farther down than your disposal.  Garbage disposals are really not that blender-like.  They don't have a blade that spins and chops things up. Ok, some really expensive ones do, and commercial kitchens have that, but a home disposal is  usually an impeller design.  It's a disc with some stuff sticking up on it that spins.  That spinning force throws particles and water against  the sides of the disposal which have sharp surfaces on them to grind up the food.  In order for garbage disposals to work properly they need water to be running.  Without water the food doesn't flush properly through the system and contact the sides. Plus the water cools the motor and keeps it from burning out.  They're pretty beefy motors.  My garbage disposal is almost as big as my sump pump."

Because people take the pulp and try to cram it down their sinks and assume the disposal will take care of it.  Get a few stray cheerios in there?  No big deal, grind em up.  Get a couple spaghetti noodles? No big deal.  A whole handful?  That's dangerous because even though it will clear your sink easily, it's more likely to slow down, congeal and clog way down the line from the sink.  Garbage disposals are handy things to have, but people rely on them far too much.  Dump your food in the trash.  I probably use my disposal at most two or three times a week."

A lot of them have bladder problems or its such a bitch to get to the toilet they drink less water to avoid it. Alzheimers also makes you confused and drinking fluids is one of those things that gets lost (cups don't make sense anymore, thirst isn't recognized). Im an OTA but only worked with the elderly in clinicals so Im a mediocre source at best."

wheredidthesodago,37m477,heybuddy93,6,Fri May 29 04:12:37 2015 UTC,A cup can become unrecognizable as an object that quenches thirst. Their motor skills downgrade and they get other issues like Parkinson's or muscle loss that make it difficult to hold a cup steady or pick up something that weighs so much. There is adaptive equipment that make it easier but as they slide down the slope of Alzheimers it doesn't help and they become completely dependent on others.   Here is a website that has some of the adaptive equipment OTs use to help people be able to continue to eat and drink. Its pretty ingenious designs!   http://www.elderstore.com/cups-and-mugs_53.aspx

wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,labouts,12,Wed May 27 17:51:31 2015 UTC,I know several people (including myself) who can only squat to depth with weight on their back due to ankle flexibility issues.
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,KanadaKid19,10,Wed May 27 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"I've been squatting for two years now and I can just barely hit parallel.  Granted, I don't know anyone whose has as hard a time squatting as I do.  I know people who don't squat deeply enough, but they're perfectly capable of it."
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,Badrush,3,Wed May 27 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"If you squat against the wall, do you feel your thighs taking all the weight or your hips/torso?"
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,KanadaKid19,2,Wed May 27 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"I may get back to you when I have a wall to squat against to consider this, but for now I will say that when I use the hack squat machine, I can very easily bottom out on it quite comfortably.  It's only in a real squat, where I'm bending further at the hips to keep the weight centered over my foot, that I have difficulty getting low enough."
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,Badrush,6,Wed May 27 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have clarified. I didn't mean a wall squat but I meant face a wall, with toes touching the wall. Then try to squat, the wall will stop your knees from going past your toes.  If you are unable to get low without tipping backwards or you are feeling your thighs (quads) take on all the strain, then you are doing it wrong. If you feel it in your hips and a little in the quads then at least you know you have the right mechanical movement.  I was in the first group for about a month, then I realized that the key is to keep your abs very tight."
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,KanadaKid19,4,Wed May 27 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"I am utterly unable to get low against a wall. I can keep my knees within an inch of my toes doing it against a desk or something, but my head shoots significantly over the desk to keep balanced.  I feel both quads and quite hips both quite heavily while homding anywhere near parallel."
wheredidthesodago,37gwk5,Badrush,4,Wed May 27 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"I was having similar issues, I couldn't bring my face close enough and if I went too low I fell backwards.  Focus on engaging your abs and sitting down. Just keep trying that. Keep your feet shoulder width apart, don't let your feet start turning (means you are using the wrong muscles). I'd even say ignore the hips and quads. Just focus on abs and sitting in a chair almost.  Took me a month of daily attempts for it to finally click in. Then I was able to get lower and not fall. Barely feel it in my quads now."

Who actually does that anyway? Cars get scratches.. that's just what they do. What most people is deal with it. One, or a few scratches, over the course of a few years ownership is completely normal, expected, wear-and-tear and does literally nothing, NOTHING, to the overall value or resale value of your vehicle. Repairing them is literally throwing money in the garbage to satisfy your testosterone ego and or OCD.   Hell, the vast majority of Americans don't even own, aren't even close to owning, the vehicles they drive. Everything is either leased or on credit, financed, owned by the bank and being replaced every few years to ""keep up with the Jones's"" because God forbid you're seen driving a vehicle that's more than one model year old anyway."
wheredidthesodago,379zd2,GanjalfTheDank,4,Tue May 26 10:43:19 2015 UTC,You really don't think having a scratched up paint job on a car affects its resale value?
wheredidthesodago,379zd2,Yaroze,-3,Tue May 26 11:22:58 2015 UTC,"What constitutes a ""scratched up"" paint job? I don't think a ""scratched up paint job"" is something you could hope to fix without repainting the entire vehicle or other major work. I'm talk about individual scratches. Cars get scratches. It happens. It's just a car. It's just an object. It's purpose is transportation, not vanity. You do what makes economic sense. You don't dump money into something with no return. Cars are already one of the fastest depreciating and most expensive necessities in the first world. If a shopping cart hits your car and scratches the paint, it's not worth paying $1000 to fix the scratch unless your vehicle is worth well over $100,000."
wheredidthesodago,379zd2,Fhajad,6,Tue May 26 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"Depending on the depth of the scratch you really should get it fixed though. The paint is not just there for looks.

wheredidthesodago,36rvwu,Vakieh,55,Fri May 22 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"Suncream isn't about burning (though that is a handy side-effect).  Skin cancer is FUCKING BRUTAL, it is sneaky, it gets into everything that used to work and mangles it into an overgrown mess of all the other types of cancer.  You don't even have to burn for skin cancer to start happening, and the only warning you'll have about it is a mole. Underneath that mole might be a root of skin cancer, slowly growing down more than out. Once that sucker metastasizes, and it will if you don't get it cut out early, or if bits of the root are missed, you can expect lung cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, heart cancer, prostate cancer, bone cancer, basically pick a thing inside of you and it. is. fucked.  In Australia where I live, skin cancer kills a WHOLE lot of people who were complacent about burning, it nearly took my mother. Don't let it take you - sunscreen, hat, shirt, and if you don't need to be in the sun then go inside."

The aging effects of too much sun exposure start sooner than grandparent age or typical death age :/  In addition, I've had people I know/am close to who spent way too much time in the sun and got skin cancer.

The jokes were almost always centred on silly solutions to problems. Some of these solutions display ""foolish wisdom"" (reaching the correct answer by the wrong train of reasoning), while others are simply wrong.   Chełm tales were told by authors like Sholom Aleichem, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Solomon Simon. A typical Chełm story might begin, ""It is said that after God made the world, he filled it with people. He sent off an angel with two sacks, one full of wisdom and one full of foolishness. The second sack was of course much heavier. So after a time it started to drag. Soon it got caught on a mountaintop and so all the foolishness spilled out and fell into Chełm.""

Chances are it's crap though.  I was renting a car for a while that didn't have Bluetooth/Aux In while my car was in the shop.  The 12V jack was horribly positioned, and the only sub-$50 transmitter I could find on short notice plugged directly into the jack.  I couldn't see the display because of the akward angle that I had to put it in.  And the first day I used it (on a 3 hour drive), it died an hour in.  This cost me $30.

wheredidthesodago,36men4,disposablecontact,4,Wed May 20 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"By design, FM only does up to 15khz audio.  There is a brick wall filter at 15khz to protect the 19khz pilot tone.  That 19khz pilot tone is what tells the receiver to decode the signal as stereo (that ST light that flickers on and off is detecting the 19khz tone).

wheredidthesodago,36men4,disposablecontact,2,Wed May 20 23:00:24 2015 UTC,"It's called audio rectification.  Usually you'd increase the shielding on the device getting interference, but in the case of a cassette adapter there's probably little you can do other than keep the phone away from it.  If the phone is far away from the cassette and it's happening because of the cord plugged into the phone, again, there's very little you can do short of putting it in airplane mode."

wheredidthesodago,360w7d,SnorlaxMaster,30,Fri May 15 07:56:51 2015 UTC,"Psychedelics have the potential to break down your ego, your sense of individuality. Normally we keep this ""wall"" erected between the outside world and our inner model of the world. We do this to protect our long-held beliefs and keep our worldview consistent. This egocentric view is valuable from an evolutionary standpoint because it is the basis of our survival instincts, but it is also the thing holding back our creativity, our compassion and our ability to make positive changes in our lives.  When this wall gets torn down by psychedelics, and we lose this feeling of our mind - our thoughts and emotions - being something distinct from the outside world, we can experience ourselves as one with the universe, one with ""god"", one with nature, and one with the other individuals around us. This new perspective can cause a radical, lasting change in the way we experience life if we manage to integrate the experience while the effects of the drug are wearing off."

wheredidthesodago,350rjd,MassiveClusterFuck,60,Wed May 6 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"It really does work! In the UK you can get stuff from amazon called Toppik, same stuff as used in the gif. It's great on thining hair but isn't much use if you have a full on bald spot, it will still stick but you can notice that it's not hair, it kinda looks like one solid lump. It's water resistant and wind resistant so it won't come out of your hair if it's raining or windy.  Only draw backs I ever found with it was that you have to use a spray to help hold the fibre to your hair. Toppik offer their own spray but it's over priced and doesn't do as good a job as normal hair spray does. You also can't really run your fingers through your hair since you essentially drag the stuff out when you do this. Oh and if you sweat alot say you go for a jog or any exercise that will cause you to sweat more than normal the hair powder mixes with the sweat and turns the sweat green! Get some funny looks when that happens! It's also pretty expensive to buy. Even the smallest tub and will maybe only last a couple of weeks if you use it daily and have alot of thinning. I stopped using the stuff a few weeks ago and just bit the bullet and shaved all my hair off! So much easier than pissing about with the hair fibre."

wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,kingeryck,44,Sun May 3 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's not even that it cooks half as much ramen. It cooks the whole brick, then it magically halves the sodium by telling you to use half the seasoning packet."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,planecrazy11,13,Sun May 3 23:50:29 2015 UTC,That's even better!
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,AveragePacifist,2,Mon May 4 00:23:28 2015 UTC,I bet there's some sodium in the noodles.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,EmLeingod,4,Mon May 4 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"It cooks the whole brick. I have one and use it at least once a week, it's great. But yeah, it says on the package that you can use half a packet of seasoning, not the it cuts the sodium in half."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,jellyshoes11,5,Mon May 4 01:44:26 2015 UTC,There's a ramen cooker?
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Kassettenkind78,8,Mon May 4 04:41:44 2015 UTC,It's really just some container that you microwave or something.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,kingeryck,5,Mon May 4 04:53:18 2015 UTC,"Aww, I imagined something like a rice cooker... just smaller."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Kassettenkind78,8,Mon May 4 04:57:14 2015 UTC,"....and square....  edit ____________________________  WTF!?  The Rapid Ramen is a rapid success, growing to a multi-million dollar company in just two years,    Using a similar science, Johnson recently launched his second product - the Rapid Mac Cooker for macaroni and cheese.

wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,idiotness,104,Sun May 3 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, the slicer thing actually looks really useful.  ....I should probably never watch infomercials....."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,skyman724,121,Sun May 3 19:53:30 2015 UTC,Some infomercial stuff is actually pretty cool and potentially a great product......then they just fuck up the marketing strategy by making it exclusively available on a shopping medium that nobody used in the first place.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Theemuts,67,Sun May 3 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"There are so many old people who do nothing but sit in front of the tv all day, watching shopping channels. Believe me, their strategy will continue to work for a few years."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Owyn_Merrilin,7,Sun May 3 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"And even if everyone younger cuts the cord, QVC and the home shopping network are both carried on OTA TV these days, I get them as subchannels with a pair of rabbit ears. Actually twice over for both, for some reason."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,skyman724,10,Sun May 3 23:15:45 2015 UTC,Not if these people have anything to say about it.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,LascielCoin,8,Sun May 3 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"True. My grandma watches her telenovelas every day and she buys almost every product that is advertised during breaks. Old people will believe anything they hear.  If it's on tv, it must be true."

wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,grundo1561,1 point,Mon May 4 13:08:04 2015 UTC,"That's good :)   Looking back, that sounded super harsh. I really meant just getting old in general. It's going to suck to have your memory go, then you're going to start sucking at driving, and you'll have no idea how to use any current technology. Maybe you'll get stuck in a retirement home and never have visitors. Not fun."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,LascielCoin,1 point,Mon May 4 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I completely understand that.   But since our generation was raised with technology, I really hope we'll be able to keep up with it even when we're old. Video games would definitely make retirement homes a bit more bearable :)"
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,grundo1561,1 point,Mon May 4 13:14:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I've always hoped. I'll just be sitting in the lounge playing virtual reality games all day every day.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Cormophyte,11,Mon May 4 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the big drawback to a lot of that stuff is build quality. Those magic bullet mini blenders are actually a really convenient size for doing quick chopping jobs and throwing it in the dishwasher, but they're mostly made out of plastic and bits and pieces will snap right the fuck off on you."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,HedonisticFrog,2,Mon May 4 00:43:05 2015 UTC,The switch actually melted open in the one I bought for my girlfriend. I had to open it up and free the mechanism so it would work again. it also sounded horrible after I fixed it.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,alleigh25,3,Tue May 5 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"I got a few infomercial toys as presents when I was a kid. That was before they were sold in places like Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond.  The ones I had were actually pretty good, too. The only one that didn't work very well was a portable ""chalkboard"" with gel in it, but I think that was a free bonus with color change markers or something. My favorite was Better Blocks."

There is literally no limit to the buns you can put these burgers on. I'll never use my grill again.  How the fuck do they do that?  Last year my cousin tried to put some burgers on a sesame roll, but they were only rated for potato. My aunt's dead now."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,spigotface,11,Sun May 3 23:34:42 2015 UTC,The Omni Bowl will blow your fucking mind.

wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,AnalBananaStick,20,Mon May 4 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"iirc billy mays actually had standards about the shit he would advertize.   Like it couldn't be crap, actually had to work, and be useful. They had a TV show about it for a short while before he died I think."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Volatilize,11,Sun May 3 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing that too. Something about how he didn't want to just push crap on old people, and how he only got all yelly-shouty when he was actually passionate about it.  But I'm not sure how true that last part is, because I've never actually seen him not being yelly-shouty."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Lareit,5,Mon May 4 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"I saw nose hair trimmers on an infomercial as part of a general face grooming kit, one of those ""we'll throw in this nose hair trimmer"" I didn't buy it, despite having always had an issue with nose hairs. Saw the same thing in a Walmart for 7 bucks sometime later.  10 years later it still works like a charm. Only had to replace the battery once.  Informericals aren't always full of shit."
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,mcvays,3,Mon May 4 03:19:07 2015 UTC,That may be. But how often are you actually trimming your nose hair?
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Lareit,5,Mon May 4 04:43:46 2015 UTC,Once a month.
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,David-Puddy,3,Mon May 4 11:58:42 2015 UTC,it would probably be good once.  then it would be a shambled mess

wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,Dark-Ganon,7,Sun May 3 20:06:56 2015 UTC,the coke probably also had a bit to do with it
wheredidthesodago,34qrtc,OMyGaarrgghh,9,Mon May 4 01:23:19 2015 UTC,I only buy things when infomercial guys yell at me to do so. I watched the video. Now I must have that slider maker thing.
