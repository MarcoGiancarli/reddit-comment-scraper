Animals,3dxfaj,Gaggamaggot,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"Story time --- Back in 2005 I had a one year old patch tabby named Nina who had yet to go into heat. She was (and is) very small which probably delayed the onset of her mating cycle. Spring of that year I rescued three kittens from a retirement village who, along with their feral mother, were scheduled to be removed by animal control. I could not capture the mama, but got the kids home and prepared to bottle-feed them as they weren't yet weaned. Nina's initial reaction was a flurry of hisses, accompanied by baleful glares at me for daring to bring in these... these... creatures!  I named them Murray, Phoebe, and Zoot.  It was apparently a stressful time, for the next day she went into heat, with all the adorable mrrrrping, purring, and butt-up koochie dancing. The day after that she went out of heat as if by magic! Then... she started dragging the kittens under the bed. I investigated, and was shocked to find she was nursing them.  She had enough milk to get her own kittens, had she birthed any, from day one through weaning, and she set out to give it all to the terrible trio. In the end I practically had to pry them apart with a crowbar, their adolescent kitty tongues were rasping her nipples off and she refused to stop nursing. I kept them apart for about 10 days feeding them solid & canned food while she dried up.  They grew to be rather large, especially compared to Nina. Phoebe fell ill and passed last year. But Murray and Zoot are still with us, and Nina is still their mama. She don't take no crap from either of them."

If you're in the UK, vets have to accept wild animals without charging you, they will make the decision as to whether there's something they can do to help it, or if it's best to put it down humanely."
Animals,3dhr5z,feliss,0,Thu Jul 16 12:39:39 2015 UTC,I'm on vacation in spain atm and they don't really speak english here so calling a vet might be a problem.

Force feeding is traumatic for animals, please don't you really may do more harm than good. Try either cat food or small chopped fish. Take him off the water, he could drown if he's weak. Just keep him dry and quiet with access to a dish of water.  I volunteer at a wild animal shelter and am doing my thesis there on gulls."
Animals,3dhr5z,feliss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:51 2015 UTC,I'm just dripping water into his mouth so I don't think it's to bad? Definitely going to try to call a vet if we find one so don't worry about that :) Trying to give it fish but he wants none of that. He is not really able to move himselve but he seemed more happy in the water (might sound stupid). He keeps his head high. But I'll take him out and try to get him dry.  If we can't find a vet around it's probably going to be a shovel to the neck. Might sound cruel but it's the fastest way I can put him down at the moment (I hope you understand this? ).
Animals,3dhr5z,feliss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"That should be ok, force feeding is something quite different. Do you have a pic of it? Also where in Spain are you, maybe can help find details of a vet?"
Animals,3dhr5z,smallspark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"at the moment it started opening his mouth and closing it only slightly, not making any sound, still not eating.

Animals,3d788v,hunca_munca,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't write this, but I love it. Stumbled upon this a few weeks ago somewhere on reddit.   .Some of you, particularly  those who think they have recently lost a dog to “death”, don’t really understand this.  I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must.  Dogs never die.  They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt.  Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea.  Let’s not go for a walk.”  Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk.  It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is.  Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is.  Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.  However, dogs get very very sleepy.  That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die.  It’s a shame, really.  Dogs have so much to offer and people just  talk a lot.  When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart.  And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch!  Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts.  But they only wag when they wake up.  That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss!  Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best  place.”  When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time.  Wap, wap, wap.  After a while they sleep more.    (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour.  Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)  Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail.  After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog.  So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.  But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.”  There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it.  It’s just who they are.  I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart.  You’ve missed so much.  Excuse me, I have to go cry now."

Unfortunately it's chances of surviving aren't high, I linked how to hand raise a baby mouse below. Good luck and I hope the little one survives :)   http://www.thefunmouse.com/info/orphanedmice.cfm"

Animals,3cjrcg,Mule2go,2,Wed Jul 8 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"That is either a break or a deformed leg and I have bad news for you. We humanely put down these kind of cases. Unless you can find a vet to take care of this, he is better off being put down. If they can't perch, they can't live. This guy is also young enough to need feeding every 20 minutes, sunup to sundown.  Edit: just read your edit. That's some unbelievable luck to have a center that can set bird bones. Give them some $$😀"
Animals,3cl7dv,avidscifireader,3,Wed Jul 8 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"If they were pets they wouldn't be roaming around unsupervised. Catch them and bring them to the SPCA.  The kittens, that is."
Animals,3cdgdq,younggunn20,9,Tue Jul 7 01:31:18 2015 UTC,Are you sure he fell?  Did you see it or did you find him on the ground?  He looks old enough to go on the ground.  You should put him back.
Animals,3cdgdq,alex3omg,7,Tue Jul 7 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"We had a nasty storm and when it was over took my dog on a walk. Noticed him struggling on the grass hopping around trying to fly. Brought him inside and fed him a blueberry, he took flight in my living room. Picked him up went to the front door, and he exploded from my hands into the sky to a near by tree. Thanked me, then left my life forever."
Animals,3cdgdq,eaglesrun,4,Tue Jul 7 15:33:08 2015 UTC,If at all possible put him back in the nest.
Animals,3cdgdq,1upthebumnoharmdone,4,Tue Jul 7 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"He's a fledgling, they live close to nests. Put him back where you found him"
Animals,3cdgdq,Cbebop21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:50:37 2015 UTC,Contact your local wildlife centre if you can't get it back in the nest. They either come get it or you can take it in to them
Animals,3cdgdq,Shurik_826,-2,Tue Jul 7 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"I've seen these before, they jump out of nests, hop around learning to fly. Like a lot of species, if you touch the young, you leave your scent on them, good chance of abandonment by parent, be careful."
Animals,3cdgdq,amemut,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:30:20 2015 UTC,This is an old wives' tale. It is completely false. OP should just put it back in the nest.

They have no business trying to pretend that they're our equals; never were, never will.   Separate, and not equal.

Animals,3c3uo7,TardyBumpkin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:44:36 2015 UTC,Dr. House had a case with a detail like this. The answer was simply heat / warmth was attracting the cat.

Animals,3c1clt,redcolumbine,6,Fri Jul 3 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"As another said, you can surrender. No, you wont be able to keep the cat, but shell live. Also, as much as I dont want to say it, if you cant afford a large unexpected expense like this, it might not be the best time to get a new kitty anyways. Shit happens with animals you know?"
Animals,3c1clt,Lucaloo,5,Fri Jul 3 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"Can I ask where you are?  I may have resources in your area.    But yes, please find a no-kill and surrender her."

Animals,3c1clt,aquasponge,5,Sat Jul 4 01:11:22 2015 UTC,Okay listen. I don't care how much you want to keep a cute little kitten--you need to take it to a shelter and surrender it because you can't take it to get help or afford surgery for it. It needs to live. It may be harsh but it needs proper treatment that you can't provide it :/

Animals,3bvueu,ricksilber,10,Thu Jul 2 15:54:20 2015 UTC,That's really dumb. Sure it's your life and if you think a cool selfie is worth your life that's not my place. But if you did get killed the lion would be to blame and the park might have to kill it because it's not safe for tourists. Meanwhile the tourist was just being risky. So please just don't do stuff like this.
