It only fell out of favor because SGML elitists were all ""markup should be metadata, it shouldn't be presentation"" and began to roll up some stylesheet languages. CSS won like all format wars do -- because the major browsers adopted it.  Whither DSSSL? Whither Panorama?  Incidentally, SoftQuad's Panorama used an SGML stylesheet language that was itself in SGML. For some dumb reason the completely alien CSS language became the standard.

On the c64 however it was basic(there where several better ones then the built-in on cartridge) or assembler.

This blocks any technology from skimming or scanning your card""  anyone familiar with the concept of a Faraday Cage would realize this is just marketing bullshit for ""we put copper in the wallet""    I am halfway tempted to call myself and see if they will explain this to me before asking for a credit card.

It genuinely saves so much freaking time of people inserting their card, entering pin (we don't have signatures anymore), and waiting. It's just a quick tap and saves a solid 10+ seconds per customer who uses it. Not sure why it isn't taking off in America, as I understand Europe is somewhat in the same boat as Australia.   That said, I don't think this is a scam, really. Yes, it's misleading for people who don't have RFID, and while it is possible to have your card details swiped by a wireless reader, the chances are very low, and it's covered by most card providers' fraudulent transaction policies. It's not, however, illegal to sell people peace of mind."

itsaunixsystem,3cjygg,gsuberland,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:01:08 2015 UTC,I mean in this context it could be considered appropriate due to the aforementioned techno-bullshit and the article being related to technology.  I'm not really sure how they determine appropriateness.

itsaunixsystem,3c4r8p,NotCleverUser,4,Sun Jul 5 00:40:23 2015 UTC,Somehow he coded it from scratch within a few hours tops too.
itsaunixsystem,3c4r8p,thefury500,14,Sun Jul 5 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"In the movie he starts out as a 'layer 1' signals expert working for a satellite communications expert. That he runs Mac OS pretty much means he has a BSD distribution of a Unix system, which he uses for the software amd hardware tools he's made.  At layer 1 of the OSI model, things are just bits on the wire. No matter what the logical layer 2 technology being used.  The movie pretty much opens with this guy having already cracked the signal anomaly hidden in our satellites.   We also learn that reverse engineering the captured ship is where all out tech came from. Which probably shows why the aliens were able to use the satellites so easily, and he was able to understand the signal so soon.  Im the extended version, you also see the guy spending a lot of time inside the captured ship, seeing what was what, as well as what others had learned about it since the 60's.  If layer one is bits on the wire, the tech we have is based on there's, Mac OS is just a proprietry shell on BSD, with full control over his custom IO hardware, and the guy is a signalling engineer, it's not as ridiculous as non computer people always insist it is.  They just get hung up on 'Aliens run Mac OS', instead of realising that what he has is a programmable computer with his own signalling hardware, that is demonstrated outside the Whitehouse early on.  It makes no difference whether he was running Mac OS, UNIX or Windows at that point. Only that he had a computer with the right hardware, and a means to program it. Mac OS actually giving you more direct access to your hardware by default than Windows ever did during that era too. Not to mention that in that era, the closest thing you could get to a Unix system with a decent and stable GUI would have been Mac OS.  Out of all the 'hacking' in all the films, this one for me is one of the lease ridiculous, given the way it sets itself up. The theatrical release just cut out a vital scene, and too many people, usually those that only know how to use Windows from its GUI—except maybe pinging from the command prompt—just seem to be offended or get hung up on the idea that it was Mac OS. If it was shown as Unix, I bet it wouldn't have had half the hate. Even though Mac OS is Unix with a front end, via the BSD licencing system.  Even the top comment here carries on with this tradition.  The skull and crossbones was the only hollywood touch. The rest is plasusible enough for me to love that movie. It's more clever than it initially lets on it is.  It's the classic War of the Worlds, replacing carelessness and assumption in regards to biology, to carelessness and assumption in regards to computer security.  The aliens failing was not accounting for that one ship that didn't come back, and relying on security through obscurity and simple remote privacy. Like our early TCP/IP networks that only a select few knew about and the US DoD ran as a project. There were no efforts made for security, because only the guys on 'their side' used it. No person wanting to do it harm had access to it to do so, or to even know how to do so if they did.  It would be like them leaving behind a computer somewhere runnning it, leaving someone to reverse engineer it, so when they did get access they could immediately interfere with the system, which many people did in the early internet, that was also made by a military organisation.  Of all the movies, this one didn't just have a guy tapping away at a terminal window to hack, nor aligning 3D shapes or flying through a mainframe. He wasn't dressed in neon with a face piercing and purple hair. He also wasn't an overweight balding nerd with no social skills. He was just a regular computer and signalling engineer, that developed his method of saving the day over the whole movie, with skills he'd learned from the decades before it. He's my kind of nerd, the one I relate to more than any other hollywood hacker/nerd.  That's what I love about it.  It is one of the best hacking saves the day movies there are, once you get the issues you have with Apple."

Nearly all desktop managers (of course including Windows) have consistent window decorations around the borders. I'd have to look at the manpage to be sure, but I'm almost certain that lsof doesn't have a -gr or a -map option (maybe -g, -r, -m, -a and -p, but then separating the two is weird).

itsaunixsystem,3bw18y,bemz,4,Fri Jul 3 10:59:35 2015 UTC,I thought these puzzles all only had one correct answer and scaled up in difficulty (word length) based on science required. How could it scale with Luck?
itsaunixsystem,3bw18y,slowest_hour,3,Thu Jul 2 23:20:03 2015 UTC,95% sure the actual difficulty of the hacking scales with Intelligence.

itsaunixsystem,3bw18y,PapaWhiskeyPapa,2,Thu Jul 2 23:50:58 2015 UTC,True. I guess I saw him saying luck so I related it to SPECIAL.

Right-clicking the application icon in the left of the title bar gives you a very basic context menu, and there is a ""Preferences"" option that opens up the interface in a lot of ways.  For instance, if you really like that green text (or background color) you can set the terminal to default to that color (or any color) every time you launch it. You can set the buffer and actual width and height of the window in rows and columns. I personally like the command prompt window to take 1/2 of my screen's vertical width. This way I can easily see very recent command history or read long output more easily, and have plenty of room on the other side of my screen for explorer windows, a text editor, or another cmd instance.  ...and this is just the most basic, low-hanging fruit of the options. There are whole tabs of that menu that I haven't even looked at yet for some reason or another."

Is there some sort of CRT scanline effect going on here as well, causing the bottom half of the output to display dimly?  On an LCD monitor?  In 2007?  Lastly... All the dirs have the same name.

itsaunixsystem,3ahd97,Compizfox,13,Sat Jun 20 16:48:39 2015 UTC,I choose to believe that they have like 512Mb of RAM and so everything is stored on their pagefile.

itsaunixsystem,3ahd97,ForceBlade,2,Sun Jun 21 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"yes it does.   if they use windows, its set by default so that when you run out of ram it will make space by storing some memory on the drive. The downside of that is software needs memory to be in ram in order to run and swapping the memory in and out of ram takes a lot of time, which is what slows your programs down. SSDs are faster so they speed this process up and the programs will respond much quicker.   Also you can run into a similar issue even when you aren't using up all your ram if the programs are all competing over the hdd."
itsaunixsystem,3ahd97,Vital_Cobra,9,Sat Jun 20 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the page file.  Of course I know that but as long as you have enough RAM, putting the page file on the SSD (instead of on a HDD) will not affect the performance in a significant way."

So I'm an actor/model living in Seoul, and im playing the 'businessman' in this promo. now, admittedly its not my best work lol, but most people arent aware of just how many factors go into making it this bad. Allow me to elaborate. They force us to speak slowly since this will be dubbed over in Korean, and even when it isnt, most people viewing it will be Korean. They ask us to exaggerate since many Korean people feel thats how we 'naturally' act (most people here are not very expressive). Ive worked many jobs where I tried to act naturally only to be told by the director to act more 'bright' (ie exaggerate). its how the director and client (in this case, Samsung), WANT us to act. the script is brutal. written by non-native english speakers, and sometimes the PD or director wont even take our suggestions to change some parts so they sound like something a normal native english speaker would say. its a promotional video, not a tv commercial, meaning it will be shown at conventions and expos and in-house. most of the people watching it are korean and thats why they make us do all of the above. edit: almost forgot, shooting took place from 730am - 3am the next day, and by the time they shot the scenes with the girl, she was literally falling asleep in her chair, hence the stoned expression and tone :)   edit; This was a Reddit comment posted by the actor and later redacted.

It doesn't crash, it doesn't lag, and you can even listen to music and do some rudimentary web browsing on it, with a full QWERTY keyboard. But if you want a general purpose computer in your pocket (well, one that's not a completely locked down black box for the end user, I'm pretty sure the hardware has involved turing complete processors from day one), that takes processing power, which takes literal power, which means a short battery life, because there's only so much in that department you can do before you're trying to break the laws of physics."

It's just as possible for attitudes to be similar to this today, though. Nowadays, it's more due willful ignorance and the conscious or unconscious contempt many people tend to have for things that they don't understand or care about (""Knowing how tech works is for geeks, we're the money makers/job creators!""). That's even though some knowledge of how IT works  - at least how to use it - is just part of consensus reality nowadays.   It can also be something more insidious though: those same kinds of guys in the ads, just older...there are some of them. I know there are because I know one of them.

Empirically, one report proposes that HRT in American English and Australian English is marked by a high tone (high pitch or high fundamental frequency) beginning on the final accented syllable near the end of the statement (the terminal), and continuing to increase in frequency (up to 40%) to the end of the intonational phrase.  New research suggests that the actual rise can occur one or more syllables after the last accented syllable of the phrase, and its range is much more variable than previously thought.

The monitor shows the LOAD ""SONARIS.EXE"" line, the blank line, and the cursor flashing at the next line already displayed.  It seems like he types RUN and presses Return, but I think that none of the equipment is even on. The 1701/2 green LED isn't lit.  The C64's red power LED isn't lit.  And the 1541's green LED nor its red access LED is ever lit from the angle we see.  Now granted the green LEDs on the 1541 drives didn't have great viewing angles, but still.  Also throughout the scene (up until the concluding modem noises) we can hear the disk drive read sound effects.  While this isn't really that unreasonable the whole thing happens unnaturally fast.  This detail was mentioned earlier in this thread.

We know it takes place in the same world as Eureka as they had cross over episodes, so why isn't anybody at Eureka studying this stuff? You can argue they are, what with all the technology at Eureka constantly killing people, but we never see it.   Nobody takes apart the infinite range no interference radio transmitters to see how they work. Nobody hooks up a multimeter to Tesla's electricity gun. In one episode a new person on the board of keeping Warehouse 13 a secret wanted to figure out how a coat that cures you of all disease but turns you into a psychopath works, but everybody told her no.  If they have no intention of ever using any of this stuff except as mcguffin they should just destroy it.

Basically, whatever ends up in the warehouse is so dangerous that nobody should even attempt to study it (at least according to the regents).  This includes certain types of new technology developed in Eureka that accidentally almost ends up killing everyone.  Of course most of the technology developed in Eureka almost ends up killing everyone and the tesla gun doesn't seem world ending, so I don't really see the regents reasoning.  Its heavily hinted that they're extra-dimensional beings or something though, so that explains why nobody in Eureka questions them."

It was an unstable area of space, with lots of black holes everywhere, and there was really only one safe route through; if you didn't go the safe way, you would get sucked in and destroyed. This safe route was something like 14 or 16 parsecs that you had no shortcuts through, though many people tried to make it as short as possible. On one occasion, Han Solo ended up getting off course and dragged into one of the black holes, almost to the point of no return, before making a last-second escape (as he is wont to do) and making it through to the other side after only having traveled 12 parsecs."

All you have to do is know how to use every tool in the garage.'   No one bothers to break into the garage because the windows and locks were assembled with the tools inside it, so short of a nuclear bomb detonating outside, or someone leaving their keys on a park bench clearly labelled 'door to my garage', nothing is getting in.   Half the buildings in the city are constructed using one or more tools from the garage, which gives most building managers the unenviable task of either learning how to use the tools themselves or hoping desperately that they never have anything break down.

In addition to being a vehicle for Kirsch's invention, the company was responsible for bringing the mouse to the IBM PC for the first time.  Mouse Systems' optical mouse, wired to a Sun workstation and an Atari 400 running Missile Command, attracted many observers at the October, 1982 Mini/Micro '82 conference in Anaheim, attended by over 10,000 people—and won a ""best new product"" award.   Like all early optical mice, their debut product relied on a special metallic and reflective mousepad printed with a square grid of grey and blue tracking lines: as the device moved over the pad, LED feedback was processed by an on-board microchip, which in turn supplied the host computer with machine-readable tracking data via an RS-232 serial port. An external power supply was required. Some mice would derive their power supply from the keyboard connector on the motherboard and came with a pass-through connector to be inserted before the keyboard cable.

(What 2015 student hasn't typed up an essay, made a spreadsheet and chart for math class, made a slideshow/PowerPoint, or at least been shown how to look up reference materials online and save their work to their personal storage?)  Probably the main reason they aren't covered more is that the technology changes too fast. The curricula can't keep up, and the knowledge that's useful at the time might be completely obsolete in a couple years. In grade school I learned how to use the Power Macintosh and Mac OS 7. By high school that information was already obsolete and CS class taught me how to maintain and repair Windows 98, floppy disks, and IDE hard drives. By the time I graduated nobody was using Win98 anymore. And don't even get me started on college courses that still use software from the 80s, running in DOSBox, to teach 386 assembly.  It might seem like a good idea to teach students today how to use the internet carefully, but it'd be difficult to do so in a way that won't become irrelevant by the time the course is finished. Should you teach them how to set Facebook privacy settings and how to use Twitter? A couple years ago we would have said the same about MySpace and Friendster. Should we teach them how to manage their privacy/security and maintain PCs in general? A few years ago that topic wouldn't have even mentioned social media, EXIF geotagging, Facebook's insanely widespread data harvesting, malicious browser extensions, smartphones and tablets and their tiny, omnipresent cameras, or 80% of the scams and exploits you need to watch out for online, because none of those things existed. 5 years from now who knows what new things we'll need to watch out for and what rules we swear by today will be obsolete.  I think schools should teach basic computer and internet skills, but care must be taken to ensure those skills and curricula remain relevant. It would have to be fairly generic things like:   how to use a keyboard, mouse, search engine, word processor, smartphone how to turn these things on/off properly, reboot them, set passwords on them how to launch/close an app how to take, share, edit, and delete photos how to look through menus to find the option you want (really, a huge portion of my expertise is ""well I don't know, but let me look through the menus for something that seems relevant"" and just experience with knowing roughly where to look for what) basic hardware: take the cover off a running PC and point to stuff:   this is the monitor, keyboard, mouse this is the CPU, it's the ""brain"", it's nowhere near as powerful as a real brain; it isn't intelligent, it just pretends to be this is the hard drive, it's where all your files are kept this is the RAM, it's the short-term memory; if you have too little, everything gets slow this is the mainboard, video processor, power supply, network jack this is the BIOS chip, it holds the program that tells the computer how to work the hard drive look at the back here, see how these things plug in and where they fit  basic software architecture:   when you turn it on it loads the program from the BIOS chip, that loads your operating system from the hard drive this is what an operating system does this is what an application, window, desktop, menu, mouse pointer, icon, disk drive, file are this is the web browser this is the difference between online and offline this is a really basic logic circuit; see how the outputs change depending on the inputs; you can call these states 0 and 1 and do math on them; that's called binary; computers are made up of trillions of these circuits; a program is instructions encoded in binary; this is an example of source code; a programmer writes code like this and has a program turn it into binary; hopefully you can understand now why they don't accept commands in plain English...  basic privacy:   don't tell people where you live, and don't give it away by accident, you can easily put all those tiny pieces together to form a detailed picture don't tell anyone your password don't believe everyone who claims they work for $big_company even if their email/caller ID looks legit whenever you're using a social app or service, look around the settings and make sure all the privacy stuff is set up right  basic file management:   here's how you save your work in the word processor/other apps here's where it goes here's how to transfer it to a removable device here's how to find it again  basic maintenance:   here's how to not run everything as admin here's how to make backups make damn sure you make regular backups here's some symptoms of computer viruses no, computer viruses aren't germs and can't infect humans or vice-versa, and computer bugs have nothing to do with insects here's some things that almost certainly aren't symptoms of viruses here's how to check out where all your free memory/disk space is going and do something about it here's how to reboot your crap ass DSL modem when the internet is acting up here's what to do if you lose your phone here's what to do when an error message pops up don't panic, it's probably nothing; you can't damage the computer just by pressing the wrong button (it takes real talent to permanently harm a modern computer just from software) software can always be reinstalled, repaired, or restored from backup so don't be too afraid to break it (and you made a backup of your important files, right? so even if something does break, it's not the end of the world)    [edited to make list nicer]"

Of course ""will this work with my mouse"" is a better question than ""will this work with my Mac"", but a lot of less tech-savvy people probably won't realize you can get different mice (can you even on a Mac?) or just don't realize that the question is too vague."

itsaunixsystem,38kzna,h3st,8,Fri Jun 5 10:52:51 2015 UTC,I'd say that it's code in the same sense that Morse code is.  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/code   a system of signals or symbols for communication  a system of symbols (as letters or numbers) used to represent assigned and often secret meanings
itsaunixsystem,38kzna,stone_henge,3,Fri Jun 5 06:19:22 2015 UTC,That is a bit misleading in my opinion. Computers operate on electrical signals. Numbers are an abstract concept that we use to represent those signals. Binary numbers make sense because they map well to the computationally significant states of the signals.
itsaunixsystem,38kzna,stone_henge,2,Fri Jun 5 08:47:37 2015 UTC,"Programming languages tend to offer bit-level functions that take numbers, though. E.g. applying a bit mask to a networking address isn't really related to the voltage encoding of those addresses, or how many bits your computer operates on (which is probably more than 1 for modern computers :^) ).  Calling object code binary code isn't terribly wrong. It's the sort of lie you could tell to children."
itsaunixsystem,38kzna,h3st,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"Lie-to-children:       A lie-to-children is a simplified explanation of technical or complex subjects as a teaching method for children and laypeople, first described by science writers Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart. The word ""children"" should not be taken literally, but as encompassing anyone in the process of learning about a given topic regardless of age. It is itself a simplification of certain concepts in the philosophy of science. [clarification needed]  Because some topics can be extremely difficult to understand without experience, introducing a full level of complexity to a student or child all at once can be overwhelming. Hence elementary explanations are simplified in a way that makes the lesson more understandable, though technically wrong. A lie-to-children is meant to be eventually replaced with a more sophisticated explanation which is closer to the truth.  Such statements are not usually intended as deceptions, and may in fact be true as a first approximation or within certain contexts. For example, Newtonian mechanics is less accurate than the theory of relativity at high speeds and quantum mechanics on small scales, but it is still a valid approximation to those theories in many situations.

itsaunixsystem,38kzna,stone_henge,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this is being down voted. To put it simply, the CPU can only process instructions in binary. Binary is a base two system where the only possible values are 0 or 1. It can be applied to something called Boolean algebra too, where 1 means True and 0 means false. When a computer program is written in a language such as C++, something called a translator converts it into binary. Obviously it is a lot more complex than what I have described but that's the essence of it"
itsaunixsystem,38kzna,sassinator1,4,Fri Jun 5 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this is being down voted.   Because while the first question is alright, the second is somewhat confused, and the third one betrays a serious confusion.   What is binary code?  Here there are many answers, because there are many ways to encode something as a binary signal / message. Someone answering it seriously could delve into signal theory, digital signals, binary representations and so forth. /u/stone_henge's answer is an alright answer to that question. How do they know its code?  What else would it be meant to represent, but something encoded in binary? It might be some decimal number that just happens to consist of nothing but 1s and 0s, but that would hardly be topical. And finally, Also who uses binary as a programming language?  This question is just plain wrong. Nobody has made a claim that anyone programs in binary. It seems like SparrowMaxx has taking the ""coding = programming"" thing too far, which, in retrospect, makes the preceding questions seem dumber.   And thus we arrive at SparrowMaxx being downvoted.

The issue is that iOS cuts the text if it's long enough on the lock screen, and due to some awkward glitch involving Arabic characters being internally longer than Latin characters, the ellipsis ends up in the technical equivalent of the middle of a letter, thus causing the crash."
itsaunixsystem,37hkqe,CreideikiVAX,6,Thu May 28 04:44:58 2015 UTC,"Sort of. The Arabic characters are the same data length as anything, it's probably UTF-8. The issue is that graphically the Arabic characters can change in length depending on position.  So, by trimming the Arabic section, it causes one of the letters on the inside that is ""short"" on the inside to become a 'final' character, which grows longer. Thus creating the situation that truncating the text makes it larger (in appearance, though the data itself is shorter).

itsaunixsystem,36rrhi,sonicboi,14,Thu May 21 18:57:42 2015 UTC,If they did it's something I was previously unaware of. That would make sense as to why you see Macs in so many movies and TV shows.

itsaunixsystem,36rrhi,aqua_scummm,2,Thu May 21 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"Not going to disagree. But Apple would probably prefer they would be doing their work on an apple watch since that is their new product.  Probably someone said ""Hey intern, we need something to put on those tv things with the typewriters attached! Go use the google or the Alta vista and find something."" The intern sighed and picked the first thing that popped up when they searched for ""desktop screen shot for grandpa"". He then rolled his eyes and said ""how is this?""

itsaunixsystem,36rrhi,wickedplayer494,2,Thu May 21 19:18:44 2015 UTC,I think there was actually something to the opposite effect?

Even worse, with the speak & spell ... he already uses the gear he has to rewrite a ROM chip, he clearly has the proper tools to do this job with.   Also, whenever they turn something on, and it fucking catches fire ... then they just say 'oops' and keep working on it. Are you joking? Is this Star Trek all over again?

itsaunixsystem,36fxzm,m_bishop,2,Wed May 20 11:42:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, watch the first episode. Seriously ... something is going 'poof' every time they're doing anything technical.   It's all the same problems that 'hacking' shows have, but applied to hardware. In reality, if he were copying the IBM Bios chip, he'd hack together a board that took a parallel port from his existing computer, then bit-banged every address on it, and wrote the resulting output to a disk ... or even a tape-recorder. This could have been done with a C64, or TRS 80, or any other popular computer of the time.   The problem with that is that, on screen, he would slot the bios chip into a board connected to a computer, and typed something like 'LD BIOSDL     RUN', and maybe, if it were especially showy, some hex would have scrolled for a few seconds, and a tape drive would have made some sounds.   To 'spice it up', they decided that he should build himself a circuit with a ton of protoboards and LEDs (not all that cheap at the time BTW), then write it BY HAND into a notebook. Then, presumably, re-program another chip BY HAND with switches or something.  That gives the show a little more to look at, but how do we know when something goes wrong? In truth, maybe an LED that should be lit, isn't lit ... or, when he tries to boot the computer, the screen remains blank, or just outputs garbage. Pretty boring, right?   So, instead, whenever ANYTHING goes wrong, or they need to build a little tension, they a have a 'POP!', and then smoke rolls out of the system.   In some situations, like you're soldering a live board (WTF?!), that COULD happen ... but, of course, you just don't typically DO that. Even if you did short something on a powered board, and accidentally blow something, the correct response would not be 'I guess I'm a little rusty', and then just keep going as if you didn't just ruin a transformer, or melt the traces on the board, or blow a chip.   Nope, they just move on ... no big deal! Plenty of smoke left in that little box. Just wave it away and get back to work!"
itsaunixsystem,36fxzm,proteusguy,1 point,Wed May 20 13:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can really think of a situation where you'd be soldering a live board either to be honest.

itsaunixsystem,36fxzm,m_bishop,1 point,Wed May 20 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've done that ... so it's a thing that happens.   Now, the situation was that I was working with another guy, and we'd designed this GPS controlled detonation system that used a microcontroller as the main driver, and a few logic boards and whatnot to control things.   Basically, we had a demo the next day, it was 4am, and our boards had just arrived THAT DAY. So we were scrambling to assemble something we could show. We were both in and out of the box, hooking things up, soldering boards together, testing thing ... he'd plugged it in to test something, and I hadn't noticed when I moved the iron in to solder the power connectors in place and BOOM ... we tripped the breaker in the building, went out for redbull and beer, and thought long and hard about how badly we needed a working demo unit for the next day.   Amazingly, I'd only managed to cross the power lines with the iron, shorting the building, but never putting power to the board. So, nothing was ruined. Typically, when something goes 'poof' it means you just ruined your whole board. We would have to build a whole new board because, even if something looked like it was working, once it'd been exposed to a ton of voltage, you weren't sure it was really 'right', and as likely as not, it would just cause problems down the road. So, once you see smoke, you just toss that board and start over ... that's why you order extras."

I had the purple hardback version, I think it was ""IBM PC Technical Reference Manual"" or somesuch. IBM's legal dept. was still under this anti-trust law and so the best way they could protect their IP was to publish it - which they did. The challenge for clone makers was to find someone who wasn't ""tainted"" having seen this easily available book (bought my copy at the local PC store where I bought my Compaq Deskpro with amber monitor, 2x5.25"" floppys, and 256K RAM) and reverse engineer the interrupts.

itsaunixsystem,3615qg,10tothe24th,11,Fri May 15 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"MAJOR SPOILERS!  Ava wasn't a carbon-copy of the human mind. That's the whole point. She has human qualities, sure, but I think the characters do a good job of explaining why that is, not to mention that she was created by humans to meet a human's concept of intelligence.  To that last point: that's why the chess computer comparison is so important. Ava was created to play and pass a challenge.  MAJOR-ER SPOILERS!  But I think we learn exactly how ""differently"" she thinks when she asks the protagonist to stay behind. We think, and he thinks, that as she's putting on her human skin she's preparing herself for him, but we understand the reality of the situation when she acts as if he isn't even there when she leaves. Not even a glance. That, to me, spoke volumes. She had no malice, no regrets, no calculations whatsoever. He was, at that point, a non-factor. That's an incredibly inhuman behavior that's further emphasized by her almost childlike expressions once she gets upstairs.  In the end, I think she passes the chess computer test, just not by their rules. She's as human as she's programmed to be, as human as she needs to be to pass the test, but she's not human the way they want her to be."

itsaunixsystem,3615qg,TGIWhiskey,2,Fri May 15 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a beautifully realized utter failure of imagination.   Well, first we should discuss that the movie is not a sci-fi, it only bears the premise of one.  In sci-fi, the author's goal is to stretch the imagination as far as possible without popping it for the audience. Rather, Ex Machina is a suspense thriller and in that regard I found it to be very imaginative for the genre, with an albeit lower bar.   Why is it that so many writers just assume that an AI will be a carbon-copy of a human mind?   In movies where there's just no plausible reason, and with AI for the sake of AI there is none, anthropomorphising is quite annoying and cliche.  At least it was a stated goal of Nathan's to make it as human as possible (only better).  Remember what his actual primary motivations were for building an AI, remember what he was doing with them...    To that end, given that Nathan's waning attempts at hiding his intense narcissism was a key component of the suspense, we're pretty much talking about an entirely different movie just for the sake of a little more plausibility; the human-mind-AI was a cornerstone of the movie.    Also, I think the lead actress did a great job of achieving 'uncanny valley' in her movements and mannerisms without ever sounding or feeling at all like a robot.  Usually AI portrayals that are anything more than a voice/puppet/cgi (i.e. onscreen human portrayal), are either lazy (i.e. they just play human)  or are very cheesy.  I think the director did a great job of utilizing her  So I wouldn't say they were un-imaginative because they were lazy, as is often the case where the AI was human because non-human characters are harder to write, frankly.  The imagination of the movie was manifest in keeping us goosebumped for hours without a single jump scare, or even a threat of jump scare, and at most 2-3 minutes of violence.  *Sorry if that reads like a paid review, but I thought anyone who hasn't seen the movie first should get both sides, lest they walk into the movie pre-jaded."

itsaunixsystem,35jgu6,I-baLL,29,Mon May 11 13:43:50 2015 UTC,"This is what makes me think that the writers aren't writing cheesy tech stuff on purpose. Somebody is feeding them actual tech info and they're getting confused by it. What I think was told to them and that they jumbled up was that malicious advertisement can be overlaid on top of real advertisement through code injected either on the client end or the server end. Somehow, out of that, the writers got ""code hidden inside another code"". It's kinda like the first episode where they didn't mention that the nanny cams were viewable from the company's site and that the CSI Cyber team didn't shut down the company, they just took the site offline. They somehow assumed that the audience would know these things."
itsaunixsystem,35jgu6,badsingularity,8,Mon May 11 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"They aren't writing this badly on purpose. Whoever made up that claim was obviously a shitty writer covering his ass essentially saying, ""I meant to do that."""

itsaunixsystem,35jgu6,turbov21,3,Wed May 13 11:13:52 2015 UTC,"That actually was a pretty decent explanation for how XSS's work. The server generates one code but malware on your computer or hidden in an ad writes over that code. It's a terrible visual, but not a horrible explanation."
itsaunixsystem,35jgu6,FireyFly,3,Mon May 11 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, underneath the cheesy and buzzword-laden presetation, clickjacking is a serious security issue that has to do with positioning two elements on top of each other. The idea is that the user sees something harmless (for instance an interesting ad) but underneath it e.g. an iframe pointed to some other domain with a prefilled form such that when you press the right part of the ad, you submit the form. Thanks to autologin being stored in cookies, and those cookies being sent as usual within the iframe, your click performs some action on the other domain.  If you give them some slack, the elements are stacked on top of each other, and each of them is powered by separate code (the ad probably contains tracking stuff in JS, and the victim site has a form and some server-side code to process it). If they consulted someone for advice, I'm guessing clickjacking was the original suggestion and then they added their Hollywood spin to it to make it sell more or something."

However, most judges used to be district attorneys (DAs). These are the prosecutors. They've been through the political system as well (often judges are elected). Siding with a defense attorney on things that make big differences is rare.  There also tends to be the political split. DAs tend to be conservatives while assigned counsel (public defenders, Legal Aid, etc) tend to be liberals. You've seen how little reaching across the aisles there has been in Congress in the last couple decades.  Other things that set him off are lawyer nit-picks. The large crowds at various hearings, man of which are barely public. I'd have to ick my dad's brain for more of it.  I sat through epic trials as a kid. They're boring. Even as an adult I know they are. Hard decisions get made, but you're really watching two men in well-worn suits beg another man in a robe to listen at all.  People used to assume I'd follow in my father's footsteps...nope. I work with computers. I may have to be diplomatic with customers, but I also know that the computer will prove us wrong or right. It crashed or it ran. The logs say which thing went south and how. The computer doesn't have a dick to be sucked."

itsaunixsystem,35cher,aaruni96,57,Sat May 9 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"This is hard to answer without sounding racist or stereotyping a vast portion of Indian people, so I'll prefix this by saying that: (a) this is mostly from my experience, reinforced by articles on academic practices; (b) there are some very smart Indian security folks out there; and (c) I think this is something that mostly applies to teenagers and young adults rather than everyone.  India has a much higher level of copying and cheating in academia as part of its culture than you would usually find in the EU/UK/US. I believe a lot of it stems from the fact that tertiary (and to some extent secondary) education was a rare privilege a few decades back, causing there to be a lot of pressure on kids to do well, especially from parents. Now tertiary education has become easier to get access to, both at home and abroad, but the same stresses and attitudes prevail.  Why is this relevant? The same attitude generally seeps into general learning practices. Kids hear hacking is cool, want to show off to their friends, so they want to know everything possible about hacking. Except that a good portion of them don't actually want to put any real effort in and just want to copy-paste examples and use tools. This is definitely culturally agnostic, but you'll usually find that the ones who are least interested in learning and the most interested in showing off silly tools are the Indian kids.  Hang out in any security/hacking related channel on IRC and you'll find this out first-hand pretty quick. A significant portion of the people asking about hacking from a ""omg how do I hak"" perspective are Indian teenagers. I see the same thing over at Security StackExchange all the time.  To be clear, I don't think all Indian people are like this - I think it's an unfortunate cultural quirk that some fall to and some do not, and simply by the power of India having a population of 1.25 billion you see it more often that you otherwise might."

It's that number-letter combo that no-one else but you and maybe your mom should know.  So of course this guy thought that this was the worst thing imaginable, and that someone could simply H4CK their way in to find these ID's. He sent a school wide email about it and it was just.. Bad. I have a feeling that he thought the passwords wouldn't be encrypted or anything. The schools IT staff sent a school wide notification into our E-mail system how everything is encrypted and even they can't touch those passwords. The whole system is much more complicated than just simple password change, since it's a city wide system. (I feel like the guy thought that the passwords would be in PASSWORD.TXT file in some random PC in some random class.)  So I made this video in response.. Because this is of course how HACKERS work. Also I was bored as fuck.  Edit: Oh right, I forgot to add that later on the passwords even wasn't changed into our Social ID's, the computers just asked us to reset our passwords when logging in.

Even if it was just a brute force attack, a single case + digit wouldnt be too hard to pull off, and if its a windows computer on a domain, the password hash is going to be stored on the computer the second someone logs in. If you can get admin access on a pc you can pull all the hashes off the computer and bring them home, and crack them at your leisure. Hell, VS includes the needed encryption libraries for NTLM.

No, you're not holding that DVD in RAM. My bad, and I see the point you are making. No, you're right, if you have just the hash you're not storing the password itself... but at some point you DID have the password in RAM (unless the hashing was done clientside?

Ideally, your application runs on a different machine than the database so that a security breach on the database server wouldn't necessarily give the attacker access to the salt that the application at least at some point stores plainly in RAM to be able to calculate salted password hashes. The database machine needn't know about the salt or  the logic around hashing.

It lurks in the sea waiting to attack and when it does, it attacks with fury and vengeance - destroying an entire ship from the shadows of the deep. More importantly though, in some story lines (like Pirates of the Caribbean) certain groups have the ability to summon the Kraken on their enemies.  My guess is these signs are trying to suggest some nefarious group of *hackers* have created an imaginary ""Kraken"" of software. If this software were to exist I would imagine it would have a way of being injected to a target (computer, network, etc) without detection and lurk in the background. Once it's call on by the attackers, it would activate and systematically destroy the target.  I would say it would be akin to something like Stuxnet but instead of slowly bringing the target to it's knees - it would overwhelmingly crush it."

Virtually nowhere in the US can you dial a 555 number and reach an actual person but odds are high that there's a machine out there with a LAN ip that's in the documentation range. Also, those ranges were assigned for documentation in 2010. A more logical way to prevent the appearance of possible real ip addresses is to use addresses that aren't possible which is what they do.

I also believe that shows avoid showing valid public IP addresses for about the same reason they use fake phone numbers. Leading to private networks, or invalid addresses."
itsaunixsystem,33i9z7,SirHaxalot,8,Wed Apr 22 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"""private subnet"" is a bit of a misnomer. You can run a private subnet with whatever IP addresses you want as long as you make things kosher when your network connects to another one... which is basically the whole point of NAT.  The IP address is mostly invalid anyhow. 355 isn't a valid octet (although, who knows, a buggy network implementation might accept this in decimal dot and end up with 99... or 1)  Similarly, the MAC address has a Z and a G in it.  So that's all pretty busted.  And, of course, beyond all that, there is nothing forcing most network cards to tell the truth about their MAC addresses anyhow. Or their IP addresses, for that matter."

itsaunixsystem,33i9z7,Bromlife,2,Wed Apr 29 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"NAT is a horrible idea period, but you probably aren't that interested in having me open that can of worms.  I didn't mean to imply that whole point of NAT was to use ""public"" IP addresses willy nilly... but when you wrap your head around the problem of limited address space, NAT is massaging 4 bytes into some other 4 bytes.  You absolutely can have a private network using ""public"" IPs. It's not a good idea and you open yourself up to some complications. I am by no means suggesting it.  What I think a lot of people forget that there is no IP address police. There are some RFCs but that's a pretty far cry from active enforcement. I challenge you to configure a small network with ""public"" IPs, set it through a gateway configured to use NAT to accomodate your anarchy, and go about your life. With a few caveats, it will work just fine, and no black helicopters will descend on your location. NAT accomodates breaking IP by default, and I'm saying that accomodation extends much farther than many people realize."

Barring advertising the routes, using public IP addresses won't cause anyone outside your network any harm. You just won't be able to route outside your network for anything that's on that subnet.  NAT doesn't really have anything to do with it.  EDIT: I'd also like to add that any ISP worth its salt shouldn't let you advertise any old route you like."
itsaunixsystem,33i9z7,Bromlife,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think I see the confusion, we're thinking about two separate topologies. For the sake of a minimally viable example, I conjure the image of a typical home network. Your gateway will have a ""real"" ""public"" IP, and is acting as a DHCP server to persuade your home devices into, say, 192.168.0.0/16 and then your gateway is also using NAT so that you can actually communicate with the rest of the outside world.  Now, just imagine the DHCP is handing out... I don't know... 205.100.255.240/28 addresses, and your gateway is configured to handle them in its translation tables for NAT, and you've properly configured the routing tables on your gateway.  Aside from connecting to the ""real"" addresses in that range, you're golden. This is the minimally viable example I'm considering."

itsaunixsystem,32vx0g,Outside_Lander,42,Fri Apr 17 05:52:19 2015 UTC,"Heavily nested directories and symlinks will cause it to stack overflow.  Better option is to use an iterator/queue pattern like this:  var files = new List<string>(); var dirs = new Queue<string>(); dirs.Enqueue(@""C:\root\path\""); while (dirs.Count > 0) {     string baseDir = dirs.Dequeue();     foreach (string dir in Directory.EnumerateDirectories(baseDir))     {         dirs.Enqueue(dir);     }     foreach (string file in Directory.EnumerateFiles(baseDir))     {         files.Add(file);     } }   This still won't deal with symlinks and hardlinks, but I wanted to keep the example simple. The idea is that the new found directories get queued up and scanned later. If you want to swap the breadth-first approach for a depth-first approach, replace the Queue<T> object with a Stack<T>.  You might think it sounds odd to use an iterator/stack pattern when you'd already be using a stack in a traditional recursion, but the difference is that your call stack is much more restricted than an artificial stack in the heap. More importantly, you shouldn't really abuse the call stack as a generic purpose stack."

In some way, it makes sense to implement this recursively. You have a 'fill' function, it checks if a pixel around your starting pixel should be filled, and if so, call the fill function on it.   This will work for small areas that need to be filled. For anything larger, you'll get a stack overflow (without infinite recursion).  The obvious simple solution is to use a queue and skip all recursion. I just happened to think of this, because I made this mistake and learned from it."

itsaunixsystem,32vx0g,gsuberland,0,Tue Apr 21 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"The point is that you should use a mechanism which isn't liable to overflow where possible, regardless of how your code is consumed."

Ive been using queues longer than I've even known what recursion was and I figured it was the obvious option since its easier to debug and understand its function.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the queued system is also a lot faster since you don't need to copy/maintain as many references and you aren't traversing the stack as much.   Heavily nested directories and symlinks   I get the symlinks, but I cant see nested directories causing a stack overflow. One of our recursive functions would manually throw an error after 10,000 levels. what file systems even support that many levels/characters?"
itsaunixsystem,32vx0g,gsuberland,3,Fri Apr 17 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the queued system is also a lot faster since you don't need to copy/maintain as many references and you aren't traversing the stack as much.   It depends on the implementation.  A straight flat stack in memory is about as computationally cheap as an algorithm can get. You can implement a stack using little more than a base pointer and a head pointer. Push is just write and increment, pop is just decrement and read. Add a little code for stack expansion and underflow detection, and you're there.  Queues in a similar flat memory implementation are just as cheap when doing dequeuing, but have heavier performance impacts when doing enqueues and inserts, because you have to shift things around. There are ways around this (base pointer and head pointer) but they make the code more complex.  The thing with heap-based stack and queue implementations, however, is that they tend not to be so simple in terms of memory layout. You'll often find that they both implement single- or double-linked lists, allowing for much cheaper enqueuing and insertion of entries. In both cases you get almost exactly equal performance.   I get the symlinks, but I cant see nested directories causing a stack overflow.   You're right in that it shouldn't, in most cases, cause an overflow. That said, it depends on a lot of factors that you can't always rely upon or control:   How far down the stack were you before the recursion started? How much stack usage represents an overflow? What's the worst case for nested directories? Is your function also being recursively called further up the stack?   If you don't account for any one of these (plus a few others) you might end up with a bug that doesn't reproduce on your box, but totally crashes for a customer. Because of these things, it's much better to control against them by using a mechanism that isn't susceptible to overflow."

itsaunixsystem,32s4on,RobKhonsu,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"E (mathematical constant):       The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. It is approximately equal to 2.71828,  and is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series      The constant can be defined in many ways. For example, e can be defined as the unique positive number a such that the graph of the function y = ax has unit slope at x = 0.  The function f(x) = ex is called the exponential function, and its inverse is the natural logarithm, or logarithm to base e. The natural logarithm of a positive number k can also be defined directly as the area under the curve y = 1/x between x = 1 and x = k, in which case, e is the number whose natural logarithm is 1. There are alternative characterizations.  Sometimes called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, e is not to be confused with γ—the Euler–Mascheroni constant, sometimes called simply Euler's constant. The number e is also known as Napier's constant, but Euler's choice of the symbol e is said to have been retained in his honor.  The constant was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli while studying compound interest.  The number e is of eminent importance in mathematics,  alongside 0, 1, π and i. All five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics, and are the five constants appearing in one formulation of Euler's identity. Like the constant π, e is irrational: it is not a ratio of integers; and it is transcendental: it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. The numerical value of e truncated to 50 decimal places is   2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995... (sequence A001113 in OEIS).

This isn't anywhere near as huge of a technology fail as we routinely see on cable TV shows. It is quite possible that somebody could program a Lock screen widget for Android which looks like this. It would be stupid and bad design for not saying who the tweet was from, but it could happen AFAIK.

itsaunixsystem,32h9eh,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 13 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"Multiverse:       The multiverse (or meta-universe) is the hypothetical set of infinite or finite possible universes (including the Universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. The various universes within the multiverse are sometimes called parallel universes or ""alternate universes"".  The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationships among the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiple universes have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology, and fiction, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called ""alternate universes"", ""quantum universes"", ""interpenetrating dimensions"", ""parallel dimensions"", ""parallel worlds"", ""alternate realities"", ""alternate timelines"", and ""dimensional planes,"" among others. The term 'multiverse' was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James in a different context.   The multiverse hypothesis is a source of debate within the physics community. Physicists disagree about whether the multiverse exists, and whether the multiverse is a proper subject of scientific inquiry.  Supporters of one of the multiverse hypotheses include Stephen Hawking,  Steven Weinberg,  Brian Greene,   Max Tegmark,  Alan Guth,  Andrei Linde,  Michio Kaku,  David Deutsch,  Leonard Susskind,  Raj Pathria,  Sean Carroll, Alex Vilenkin,  Laura Mersini-Houghton,   and Neil deGrasse Tyson.  In contrast, critics such as Jim Baggott,  David Gross,  Paul Steinhardt,  George Ellis   and Paul Davies have argued that the multiverse question is philosophical rather than scientific, that the multiverse cannot be a scientific question because it lacks falsifiability, or even that the multiverse hypothesis is harmful or pseudoscientific.

itsaunixsystem,32c79l,nikrolls,57,Mon Apr 13 03:04:35 2015 UTC,"I did some stuff that was waaaay worse than this kid when I was in high school.  Wall of text incoming!  In grade 8, my french class had the archaic powerbook laptops, because yay tiny school budgets. Normally these are fine, and you can make them pretty safe with just a few easy steps, but I was already an avid *nix and security nut by then. For those of you who don't know how PPC Macs worked under the hood, they used what is called OpenFirmware instead of BIOS.  When booting a PPC mac, you can hold down command+option+O+F to boot to OpenFirmware mode. You get a white screen with a black command line on it. There's a few things you can do here, such as   Set an OpenFirmware password Set some text to be displayed when you boot to OpenFirmware mode Manipulate files   Now, the IT guy (yeah, our district only had one) had not done either of the first two steps. If he had set an OpenFirmware password, I'd be stuck, since I wasn't able to change any hardware and make the Openfirmware settings reset themselves. But since he had left these laptops completely vulnerable, I was able to go ahead!  On OS X, there is a file that gets created after the initial setup of the computer is finished. If that file is removed, you'll be prompted to create a new admin account when you next boot up the computer. So that's what I did! And I'm pretty sure the account I made is still there as well! If anyone uses laptop 8 and sees the ""herp"" account on the login screen, the password for it is ""derp"", and you'll have full admin powers on that laptop. Go nuts, grade 8 french students!  Anyways, from there you can do some cool things with older versions of OS X, like getting a SHA-1 hash of the password for any user you want. OS X's password management has since been changed to be far more secure. The passwords aren't stored in plaintext, which would have made the next part of my plan wonderfully easy, but it wasn't too tough for me. I got the password hash, then let John The Ripper run on my little Ubuntu server I had at home. After about a week of the fan constantly screaming, it was done! The password for the teacher account on that laptop was ""d1ploma"". I took a guess and figured that it'd also be used on other laptops in that class. It turns out that it was! Since the password was used on all of the laptops in that class, why not try it on some of the other school computers? Well, it turns out that each and every teacher account on every computer in the school used the same password... At this point, I was pretty sure it would have stopped there, but just in case, I asked some friends at other high schools to test it out for me.  It turns out that the district IT guy had used the exact same password for each and every teacher account on each and every computer in the whole district... And it's still in use today."

And since BOINC projects run with a nice level of 20, it wouldn't even have any effect on the computers performance (because making 30 second flash clips totally requires all the performance you can get...)  When he found out, he flipped shit. Started saying that it's obviously a virus and that he needs to reimage the computers that I had installed it on.

Obviously the second one is a little clearer since we don't need to escape the double quotes anymore.  Alternatively, if we had a message with an apostrophe:  message = ""I didn't do it!"" message = 'I didn\'t do it!'   we'd have to escape the apostrophe in the single-quote string but not in the double quote one.

If the if statement there evaluates whether or not the thing in brackets is True or False.  Usually you would do a comparison there and then make a decision:  if [this_thing < that_thing]     print ""this thing is smaller than that thing""   But if you don't have a comparison, it just evaluates if the thing you pass in there is True or False all on its own.  And if all you do is ask if a string is True or False, the answer you always get is True, because basically it's just asking ""does this string exist"".  Of course it exists!  In other words, there is no way that this code won't trigger the detonation.  The second you start this program, the bomb explodes."

Since the code (the part of it being evaluated, at least)  in the screenshot looks similar to HTML or XML, a better approach would have been   ""<source ='delete'>""  Not that the code in the picture means anything though, since it's trying to evaluate a string. Evaluating a string is language-dependent, but in some of the less type-safe ones (such as Javascript), any string that doesn't directly parse to 0 will evaluate to true. This means that the bomb will detonate no matter what.  Also, HTML-wise, it would still NOT mean anything. It would just be a textual representation of an empty element with a source attribute set to ""delete"". I don't even think it's legal to have empty elements."

When you are counting in (our) base 10, you get to 9, then 'wrap' around, starting at 0 again and incrementing the tens place by one.

Binary is base 2, so it has 2 symbols: 0 and 1  Octal is base 8, so it has 8: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7  Base 13 would be:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 20 ... etc  You can see it in action with computers using hex number systems like in HTML Color codes:  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F"

So for example 104 in decimal is 1*102 + 0*101 + 4*100.  10 in any base is 1*base1 + 0*base0, which simplifies to 1*base. So yes, every base is base 10 (where ""10"" is written in the base of whatever number you're using). It's a fact. If you can find a counterexample I'd love to hear it."

We would go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A 10 (or whatever symbol you want to use in place of A).  And for the purposes of determining what ""10"" is, it doesn't even matter what symbols you use, so long as we can agree that ""1"" immediately follows ""0""."

Also accessing the webcam while the laptop is shutdown or in sleep mode is possible but would be easy to notice (I'm not aware of a way to disable power and HDD LEDs through software)  It would be hard to do this without physical access to the laptop though. Targeted phishing is a possibility, or just including the capabilities as part of a bigger malware package (although that wouldn't be targeted).

The scary thing is, if you had physical access to the laptop then its probably someone you know and there's a lot better chance that you'd do something like this (if you had malicious intent).

We use it on PCMR because we don't really have a single topic, but this sub has a defined purpose: showcase idiotic tech moments in media. I think refining that purpose would be best here.   A good example, IMO, is the sub /r/comeonandslam, a sub dedicated to mixing the theme of Space Jam into other songs. They previously did not enforce any content rules, which led to the sub having lots of activity but losing sight of what the sub was created to be. After the mods implemented a strict ""non Slam Jam content must be a self post"" policy, activity plummeted but arguably the sub is better than ever."

Guessing passwords is as trivial as going down a list of common passwords (ie ""password1"", ""baseball"", etc) or determining passwords that would be resonable (though stupid) for a person to have (ie their date of birth, their mother's maiden name).

Mike Bergman, founder of BrightPlanet and credited with coining the name,  said that searching on the internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed.  Most of the web's information is buried far down on sites, and standard search engines do not find it. Traditional search engines cannot see nor retrieve content in the deep web. The portion of the web that is indexed by standard search engines is known as the surface web. As of 2001 [update], [needs update] the deep web was several orders of magnitude larger than the surface web.   The deep web is a separate entity from the dark internet, which is made up of computers that can no longer be reached via the internet. Also, the Darknet—ambiguously known as Dark Web—which consists of various anonymizing networks like Tor and the resources that they provide access to, is not synonymous with the deep web, but is a subsection of it.

It's a powder, and after it's laid down, the fuser melts it to the paper.  Pretty much like iron on transfer letters from the craft store. The driver that sends the print job to the printer can request different temps or ""fusing levels"" depending on model (6 of one 00000110 of the other). That's because different stock (glossy paper, transparency, photo stock) bonds with different toners at different temps.  Put transparency stock in the printer, crank up the fused temp to max, and you can either ruin the printer, or duplicate the issue reported in that article. All without sending a malicious firmware update.   Also, I'm no fan of HP, but you can lock them down pretty well.  At least in some jetdirect versions, override the update settings and url (so corps can manage changes)."

itsaunixsystem,3021q5,mszegedy,12,Mon Mar 23 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"So that's a hard question to answer. I am a programmer but i am by no means a security expert. From what i understand there are basically three(ish) main avenues for attacking a computer. The first am simplest to understand is DDoS-ing. The basics of this kind of attack is to overwhelm the target computer or system into crashing/not working properly. This is done by have a large number of computers submit jobs/packets to a single target. The idea hear is for the target computer to not be able to identify valid user traffic from the fake traffic of the attack, making normal users unable to use the target computer. This is what most of the Anonymous attacks are that most people hear about(notable exceptions being the sony hacks). The second type of attack is to target the people who use the system(this is the easiest and most successful types of hacks). This kind of attack basically targets the end user of a service in hopes of getting private data about that specific user. For instance, a ""hacker"" may install a key logging application on a library computer and attempt to collect usernames/passwords for Facebook accounts of people who use that computer. It is much easier to get the password of someone this way then to try and take over a Facebook password server(also facebook does not store passwords anymore only encrypted passwords). The last type of attack are the real deal. They target systems and try and capture sensitive data store and protected by a system. These attacks are VERY complicated and very widely. This is kind of the point. Most successful attacks on a system come from attacking a system in a unique and unexpected manor. If you want to know more about these you will have to do research try Wikipedia-ing, Man in the middle, shell shock, heartbleed, and buffer overflow, for a few more complicated attacks."
itsaunixsystem,3021q5,RoflHouse42,2,Mon Mar 23 21:38:00 2015 UTC,Also cross site scripting is a hugely successful hack that people have used in the past. I should also note hear hacking is a terrible idea and highly illegal.
itsaunixsystem,3021q5,RoflHouse42,4,Mon Mar 23 21:39:58 2015 UTC,XSS attacks have been pretty much neutered since the late 90's. Most/all browsers now prevent XSS with various sandboxing/denial of permission.
itsaunixsystem,3021q5,mrjackspade,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:24:54 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to write code that's XSS resistant if you use modern approaches and avoid treating HTML naively as a string. But it's still really easy to write code with XSS vulnerabilities, especially with templating or vulnerable JS libraries. Here's a quick example: http://jsbin.com/tecoyoxego/1/edit?html,js,output  Even if the browser limits the JS, all you really need is access to window.location. That allows you to do a redirect, which could go to a phishing site or a site that exploits a Flash/Java vulnerability instead."
itsaunixsystem,3021q5,j201,3,Tue Mar 24 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"While I will admit that to a degree the concerns about XSS attacks could be valid, you have to admit that 99.99% of the time all you're going to accomplish with an XSS attack is piss off some poorly-written-BBS users.   I dont really think thats what OP was asking about though. I would go out on a limb and say that social-engineering or infected hardware is going to yield a better return.  I feel like, when we are talking about the sort of hollywood style targeting and attacks that actually cause damage or lead to elevated privileges, XSS is pretty much not an option."
itsaunixsystem,3021q5,mrjackspade,6,Tue Mar 24 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"Your question and the thing you are trying to debunk are two different things. Let's see if we can help broaden your view of what a 'hacker' is and what 'malicious hackers' commonly use which I think more accurately reflects your question.  I'm going to go reverse order and start with what a 'hacker' is. This is completely relative though and there is much debate. A hacker, IMO, and many in the computer security/computer anything fields; is simply someone who takes a system (whether it be hardware or software) and uses it in such a manner in which it was not intended, designed, or preferred to be operated. This isn't always malicious for that I refer you to the 'hats' (also frequently debated). In my opinion the hats are categorized as white hat hackers (People who attempt to exploit a system in order to test security or warn someone of a problem so they can fix it (Furthermore; most books will include the line 'with permission' but I don't see that as always being the case. While consent should be sought/given I think the moral intent here defines the 'white' hat  hacker as opposed to legality. It's possible to break the law with good intent. Perhapse a  subcategory of legal white hack would better encompass those with consent.)), Grey hat hackers (Thos who hack out of curiosity to determine if they can do something without the intent of notifying system owners nor intend to do destructive things (although a Grey hat may unintentionally break something, again my definition is by intent), and finally 'Black hat' hackers (those with ill intent to system owners who are there to steal data or damage systems for what ever motivation).  You'll find the term 'black hat' used with a popular security conference. That conference isn't actually 'black' and is usually just vendors whoring out firewall or security software and a few classes that are conducted.   So, as you can see, hacker is a broad category. The media just uses the negative 'black hat' meaning when they use the term 'hacker.'  As for 'how' modern hacking is done; i'll assume you intended the 'black hat' style of hacker. Hacking of any  type usually involves a set of steps, also debated. Commonly it's some variation of Reconnaissance, scanning/probing, access, escalation, persistence (and pivoting), and counter-forensics. Reconnaissance can be dumpster diving, googling, wikipediaing, going through targets publicaly available information or if you're privy to network traffic or are physically nearby: Digital and physical surveillance.  Scanning/probing is done to enumerate and fingerprint hosts (How many systems can I see, what system and applications does it seem like they are running). This helps the hacker choose an exploit to use to try and gain access. Common exploits are things like SQLi (SQL database injections), Cross-site scripting, and drive by downloads which encompass frequent web based attacks, but can be as simple as someone using a default or common password.  Access, this phase is finding the right exploit to give you access to a system or interact with a system in an unintended way. Privileged escalation is methods to get your initial access to an account or method of running commands/code your previous access prevented. This can be done by installing keyboard sniffers that capture credentials. Buffer overflows that surpass a given spot in memory and can be used with malicious code to write into a different area of memory that can be executed.  Persistence is keeping your access. Whether it's installing additional back doors or getting access to another system in that network so if one is discovered you can still use the other. Antiforensics is done to cover your tracks. Remove/modify logs. Exfil data via http or some other port/method that may makes it harder to detect on. Create legitimate looking processes or accounts, etc...  Things don't necessarily have to follow in sequence. For instance; some spear phishing techniques will send an email to an intended target that looks legitimate and relevant to what they'd expect that contains an infected pdf. The pdf has hidden code that puts in a RAT (remote access tool.) The PDF may still open or reopen after crashing, but the end user is usually unaware that they've been compromised. This has bypassed the scanning and probing phase and gone straight to access.   There is a treasure trove of information you can find around the net here or on reddit and you can always query the folks as /r/netsec (ask.netsec) or any of the other IT Security sub reddits."

Launch attack.   The alternative is NON TARGETED attacks, which are more or less scanning and analyzing a range of addresses to find open ports that MAY represent vulnerable software, but if you're looking for something like what's shown on TV, that's not going to be it.   If you want to see what REAL hacking looks like, look up screenshots for various IDE. Because the real reality is that its like planning a mission to another planet.

It comes loaded with pretty much every tool you could ever dream of. Databases of as many known vulnerabilities as people write and submit.  Amateurs use precompiled scripts and payloads, but with a bit of knowhow you can easily write your own attack scripts and payloads.   As an example.  With my phone, if you're on an open wifi connection I can man in the middle you. Meaning that all of your data you send and recieve goes through me. With this happening, I can control what you do or don't see. A harmless prank is to replace every image your victim sees with you giving them the finger.  A more dangerous example would be  You have a secure network.  I create a network with all of the same credentials as yours, then DOS your actual network which causes all of your devices to reconnect to MY network. Then, I clone facebook and make it so that if you try and log in, it will dump your email and password you entered into a file on my computer.   Then using the man in the middle, you try and access the real facebook,a nd I instead send you the fake facebook.   You try to log in  I get your info and redirect you to the real facebook.  Because most people use the same passwords for everything, odds are high that I know have your email and password, or at the very least an old password for your email. Which means I can easily access your email.  With your email, I can basically ruin your digital life by getting access to your bank account.

These IP addresses may be used for maintenance of routing tables, multicast, operation under failure modes, or to provide addressing space for public, unrestricted uses.  The IETF sets the guidelines for use of the IP address space in RFC specifications, and directs IANA to implement the policies. Reserved IP addresses tend to belong to three categories: addresses that are globally unique, addresses that are unique to the subnet, and addresses that are only relevant to the host using the address.

It's not too useful since the normal 411 directory assistance can access the computers of other area codes and automatically transfer you to the local area DA operators automatically, but it's still there if you need to use it. Also, of course, like 411, NPA+555-1212 costs money.     Other numbers in the '555' office codes are numbers actually purchased by movie companies and advertisers that do actually work (and usually also cost money) and promote the work to which they are related.

The standard was released for usage in 1972. Its formal name is Pulse code modulation (PCM) of voice frequencies. It is a required standard in many technologies, for example in H.320 and H.323 specifications. It can also be used for fax communication over IP networks (as defined in T.38 specification). G.711, also known as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), is a very commonly used waveform codec. G.711 is a narrowband audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300–3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions; μ-law, which is used primarily in North America, and A-law, which is in use in most other countries outside North America.

Most cell phones around this time would be using GSM encoding or something similar to GSM which is LOSSY. This is why music would sound very bad on most cell phones from this era (the codec is meant to be predictive for speech). If data could be transmitted over a lossy medium without degradation, then why did modems have such poor bitrates when users were farther than 3 miles from the central office when most users wouldn't even notice a change in quality? GSM compression is very noticeable to users, by contrast.  PCM alone COULD be used to transmit fax/data/etc because it is lossless (like I said would work). However, there is no way that you would have the bandwidth for PCM without GSM compression on a cellular device. A landline would be needed for that kind of bitrate.  GSM takes G.711 PCM as a source, yes. And yes PCM is lossless, but it's insane to think that the cellular network could handle 64kb/sec in anything but the most ideal conditions.

The quality of the coded speech is quite poor by modern standards, but at the time of development (early 1990s) it was a good compromise between computational complexity and quality, requiring only on the order of a million additions and multiplications per second. The codec is still widely used in networks around the world. Gradually FR will be replaced by Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) standards, which provide much higher speech quality with lower bit rate.

A fully AFSK modem that operates at a slow enough rate wouldn't be impacted by the lossy coding. Think something along the lines of Bell 103. Though 1200 baud PSK of the Bell 212 might not work, depending on various factors. Bell 103 style AFSK (at 300 baud) though would work, presuming your cellular connection isn't unusable.  You'd get even better response out of using AFSK modems running at teletype/telex machine speeds (45.45, 50, or 75 baud for ""Baudot"" speaking Telex machines (e.g. Teletype Model 28), 110 baud for ASCII teletype machines (Teletype Model 33)), mostly due to their lower speed and greater tolerance for lossy conditions."
itsaunixsystem,2zk0ei,CreideikiVAX,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree that the lower baud you go, the more likely a connection is to work over a lossy connection.  I can't speak to the specifics of how the Half/Full/EnhancedFull-Rate voice codec encodes data, but I would think that it would be using something involving frequency manipulation (like mp3, jpg, etc all do) which explains why speech over a poor connection often made the person sound as though the other end is kind of... drowning, for lack of a better word.  If the compression being used is frequency based (pretty likely) then the issue is going to be that all of the high frequency waves will be removed from the audio in order to better compress the signal. Those same high frequency waves would be very important for maintaining any kind of signal at all for a baud rate over single digits.  Apparently some people have been able to connect at ultra low baud rates though, so perhaps the codec does not use frequency based compression (or isn't removing high frequencies) but that seems wasteful to not do."

In terms of frequency fudging, 300-3300 Hz is the voice range that is ""guaranteed"" to go through the land line network, even after companding.  That's why I say that AFSK modems like the Bell 103 would work, as it uses frequencies in the voice range (inside that magical 300-3300 Hz envelope). The Bell 101 modems that were installed in Model 33 and Model 35 Teletype machines that ran at 110 baud/110 bps were pretty much the same as the 300 baud/300 bps Bell 103 modems (in fact the 101 was the same, just limited to which of the two frequency pairs it could transmit and which it could receive on).

He also goes on to say it was possible at 2400 baud.   Just to rant, 64Kb/s has been the ""golden standard"" and is still used in VOIP today. It really should be at least tripled, because it sounds like shit. That's not even compressed audio, thats the shit raw audio at 64kb/s."

T carrier introduced digital trunks to the PSTN. Further the telephone central office switches, and the trunk switches that switch them, are all computerized and switch data. Back when there was still crossbar, step-by-step, panel, and even the early ESS switches were analogue audio channels switched.  Essentially now, the PSTN works by having an ADC and a DAC serving your line that turns your voice into a PCM data stream, and another PCM data stream into what you hear, and then that data stream gets sent to wherever."

In terms of practicality, there's probably a limit to how good the cellphone's voice path is, so you'd probably be limited to something like Bell 103, or Bell 212 standards (300 and 1200 baud respectively). But V.34 (28.8K/33.6K) probably isn't going to work. And V.90/V.92 (56K direct PCM) is most assuredly not going to work even slightly.     There are better applications of one's time and money, of course.

A bit ridiculous, sure, but consistent with the movie. I loved it."
itsaunixsystem,2zgw6w,GerbilEnthusiast,4,Sat Mar 21 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"Former cognitive science student here - we actually can't rule out the possibility that consciousness is representable in a form sort of like that. It is hard to imagine such a data structure would have any meaningful onscreen representation like that pulsating, high-res, vaguely RSA/DSA randomart-fingerprint-lookin' thing that Chappie called up once he'd figured out how to encode it, but such a data structure might nonetheless be expressible in a more succinct fashion than any of us guess.  By way of analogy, a VM ""saved state"" file needn't contain an exhaustive map of all the transistors in a computer, their connection topology and each of their voltage potentials at a given moment. The VM operates at a somewhat higher level of abstraction. I think Chappie's big breakthrough was to figure out what that representative abstraction has to look like for the case of a conscious mind; it's exactly the sort of complex insight which an AI might conceivably be able to achieve where humans fail, and furthermore, if the technology already existed to just save the state of every neuron in a brain by brute force, then this technique would already be employed at scale by humans with much bigger stacks of hardware than Chappie's little playstation cluster. This implies, to me, that his discovery had something to do with how to encode that data (or the important parts of it) into a much lower-entropy format than the raw brain-scan data.  The real howler, to me, was the idea that a brain-reading hat designed for use on humans would work on a robot."
itsaunixsystem,2zgw6w,spazdor,4,Thu Mar 26 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"This is a really really good point. The movie did make it seem, however, that the transfer of consciousness was strictly one way (death in one body, life in the other), adding a sort of mystical aspect to it.  The brain-reading hat working on Chappie was a bit of a stretch for me as well, but I still bought it. He struggled with it for a while, implying (to me) that its delicate sensors were tuned to pick up on the workings of his silicon vs a human's grey matter. A bit silly, but not entirely unbelievable.  Overall, the fantastical sci-fi elements were given just enough wiggle room to make sense on some level- so much more than you can say about pretty much any modern sci-fi movie. This one isn't getting the praise it deserves."
itsaunixsystem,2zgw6w,GerbilEnthusiast,4,Fri Mar 27 00:04:16 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this more, and it seems to me that the secret of how to create a conscious AI program, and the secret of how to create a ""lossy but preserves the important parts"" algorithm for compressing and restoring human brain-state information, might turn out to be very closely related problems. The best lossy compression algorithms are ones which express something of the actual semantic content of the material they're encoding.  For instance, sounds are perceived by humans as different pitches and timbres of sound, which manifest physically as the properties (frequency, amplitude) of sums of sine waves. And lo and behold, all our audio compression algorithms depend heavily on Fourier transforms, functions which express time-domain audio data as sums of sine waves. Good image compression formats are ones which exploit the regularities in the pictorial content humans look at, and which capture slightly higher-level visual concepts like contiguous colour, shape, line, gradient, etc.  So: I think if you had a hope of storing a human ""brain state"" in a feasibly small amount of data which would preserve or recreate their consciousness, you would pretty much have to have mapped out the algorithm which a conscious mind embodies. In this light, it seems very likely that the first fully conscious AI would be the one to figure out what Chappie did.  ps. Maybe the helmet is just a general purpose 3d imaging system of some kind? I think that would be an ok excuse."

It will be fascinating to see how that actually works in a human brain when we start to unravel more of that mystery. Of course we're tackling the problem from the exact opposite direction with our technology, as our consciousness is an emergent property of chaotic evolution.

itsaunixsystem,2zfdru,Cantankery,3,Thu Mar 19 14:37:55 2015 UTC,like watching paint dry.   Perhaps the only realistic part of the show (says anyone that's monitored IDS logs for any length of time).

Or, even if there was a world best white hat hacker he probably wouldn't be working for some local law enforcement agency for probably less than 6 figures.  What probably sealed the deal is when he showed up to his interview in an actual white hat that was given to him by Linux Torvalds when he was crowned the best white hat hacker in the world.  Of course we know that Walter O'Brien has the grey hat. I won't tell you who has the black one because he's listening to us right now."

He would work in the lab and I would have fun on his HP-UX machines spamming people on IRC using built in tools on BitchX or ircii or whatever it was. I of course thought I was hot shit at the time. I met another kid near my age who lived in Canada who knew computers. We started chatting and he of course talked about how he was an elite hacker. One day at home (while my dad was on a business trip) he bragged he could hack into the HP-UX machine I was running irc from (I was at home, but using the terminal at my dads work). I told my dad and he said 'tell him to try.' So I did. Needless to say a couple minutes later he cat'ed me (via msg) the passwd file. He told me how he did it but it was well over my head at the time (I wish I remembered). It was around 11pm at night so my dad called to wake up one of his techs to go in and shut down the machine until he could get back and patch the security hole. Oddly enough my dad wasn't upset. I think he felt I could learn something from the guy.  I also worked for a guy at a ISP in the mid 90s who was banned from the internet because he faxed a military base their passwd file after they fired him."

The Sokol is described by its makers as a rescue suit [(https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokol_space_suit#endnote_abramov), and it is not capable of being used outside the spacecraft in a spacewalk or extra-vehicular activity.

Once they get added, they don't tend to be common anymore as old installs are removed and the seller moves on to a new code base. Saying ""if its super common, the virus scanner would have caught it"" is like saying ""if the virus (medical) super common, there would be a vaccine for it""  I'm aware that the two aren't mutually exclusive, I just think that things like infected code turning red and causing color bleeds is a bit more ridiculous"

To be fair, the second part of that isn't that insecure (dictionary word passwords are bad tho). It's a lot more likely that someone will try to break into one of your accounts remotely than to enter your house and find your password, and if that helps you have a secure password, that's fine. Even better would be to remember a short password and append that to the end of the random password."

A lot of genuinely decent people would be tempted too.  Then down the line they might get motive to do something more damaging and THEN it becomes a real issue because they know how to access your stuff.

If you want to look backwards and you're tailing with tail, this results in a dance between tail and $EDITOR.  You can also regex through a log, and filter/exclude the whole file by regex. tail does not come close to being this useful for working with logs.

The IETF sets the guidelines for use of the IP address space in RFC specifications, and directs IANA to implement the policies.

itsaunixsystem,2wtbet,miellaby,25,Mon Feb 23 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Popularity of article  War dialing:       The popular name for this technique originated in the 1983 film WarGames.  In the film, the protagonist programmed his computer to dial every telephone number in Sunnyvale, California to find other computer systems. Prior to the movie's release, this technique was known as ""hammer dialing"" or ""demon dialing"", [citation needed] but by 1985 at least one company advertised a ""War Games Autodialer"" for Commodore computers.  'WarGames Dialer' programs became common on bulletin board systems of the time, with file names often truncated to wardial.exe and the like due to length restrictions of 8 characters on such systems. Eventually, the etymology of the name fell behind as ""war dialing"" gained its own currency within computing culture.

In a scene in the film, the character Lex Murphy, played by Ariana Richards, finds a computer displaying the interface. She exclaims ""It's a UNIX system! I know this!"" and proceeds to restart the building's access control system, locking the laboratory's doors. After the release of the film, some perceived the visualization as an example of media misrepresentation of computers,  citing the computer game-like display as being an unrealistic Hollywood mockup.

The hacker's job in real life, most of the time, is to set up some bots and then go do something more interesting.    The guy on the receiving end is who has to scramble.  So having worked on the front line in Ops rooms for eCommerce (big hacking target), here is what it's really like.    Usually, there is a system in place to detect bad behavior.  In huge, well-funded operations, you have a third party do it for you, like Dell SecureWorks.  They just call you and say ""we blocked an IP for bad behavior.""    In medium to big operations, which are way more fun.  You have big monitors on the wall with easy visualizations like Logstalgia.  One glance will tell you if you're getting DDOS'd or if there is other unusual traffic (like IPs trying to get to index.php/admin/ even though you're an ATG shop).    So then you have to take note of that IP, do hasty research (whois/ISP/geographic origin), and make the decision of whether to block this IP on the F5 (which is a single command after an SSH).    DDOS are more tricky, especially from a botnet.  And they can do real damage, so then it's a phone call, people shitting bricks, managers yelling at Akamai people, and Akamai people saying ""we told you - you should have bought our diamond-studded filtering service!""    But from a typing fast on the keyboard perspective?  It's mostly to send out email updates so people just calm the fuck down.     edit:  Operations is where the fun is.

The series follows the actions of Section 20, a secretive branch of the British Defence Intelligence service (DI), who operate several high risk, priority missions throughout the globe. The series began broadcasting on Sky1 on 5 May 2010, showing the first six-part series. After a second series was commissioned, it was announced that Cinemax would co-produce the franchise. The first episode of the ten-part second series, under the banner title Project Dawn in the United Kingdom, first aired on Cinemax on 12 August 2011. The ten-part third series, under the title Strike Back: Vengeance, began airing on Cinemax on 17 August 2012. On 3 October 2012, Cinemax and Sky commissioned a fourth series, which was broadcast on Cinemax beginning 9 August 2013.   A ten-episode fifth and final season will air in 2015.

You can't do that with phones numbers because they are already base 10. The equivalent to the above for phone numbers would be a phone number of the form 0x (9CF) 83A-B240.

I guess it would be much more implausible to do the same with phone numbers bcz the size constraints there are not that rigid... who uses an emergency number like 0118 999 881 999 119 725.... 3 in real life ;)"

There is for IP so those set IPs are absolutely useless.  Not to mention the internet is worldwide and having the same IP ranges for US, Sweden and Hungary would look more stupid than having 265 in an IP number.  If they use 192.168.1.100 or 10.0.0.1, people would post it here saying ""hey, he's hacking his own network lolol!""  If they use the so-called valid IP addresses set for use in documentation, people would either point out that ""computers from lot of different countries share the same IP range lololol!"" or ""they must be hacking the documentation servers lololol!"" -- Every post here about IP is from someone who knows one thing about IPv4 addresses (that the numbers don't go above 255) and needs to share that to feel nerdy enough.  Out of range IPs are efficient and they do their job better than the preset IPs. More importantly no one gives a shit about the numbers that show up for a second on screen. Except for the aforementioned people who have learned the one thing about IPv4. People should get the fuck over it already.

itsaunixsystem,2t44vp,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Jan 21 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Sure! :) 1.) You never want to give that long of a name to a variable.  Its inefficient and harder to remember.  If you are looking to make it descriptive so others (or yourself) can understand it right away, then you comment your source code. 2.) They put a space in between ""_paramid"" and"" __read"" (Big nono, ends up with an error because variables can only be defined with alphanumeric labels.).    NINJA EDIT: fixed a double word"
itsaunixsystem,2t44vp,rdvl97,3,Sun Jan 25 22:32:30 2015 UTC,__read_mostly is a macro in the Linux kernel (and possibly elsewhere) that expands into an attribute specification. The syntax is correct.  IMO the name is fine for a file-scope variable.

For people like me it is both frustrating and hilarious how lazily put together some of these shows are sometimes.

itsaunixsystem,2t44vp,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:40:54 2015 UTC,Cool!  If they are stating the show as futuristic scifi im pretty okay with that (since we really don't know how technology will advance in the future)!

Although different, the two parts of this key pair are mathematically linked. The public key is used to encrypt plaintext or to verify a digital signature; whereas the private key is used to decrypt ciphertext or to create a digital signature. The term ""asymmetric"" stems from the use of different keys to perform these opposite functions, each the inverse of the other – as contrasted with conventional (""symmetric"") cryptography which relies on the same key to perform both.

In 2011 government sources stated that these ""counterfeit bills were in worldwide circulation from the late 1980s until at least July 2000"" in an extradition court case.   Various groups have been suspected of creating such notes, and international opinion on the origin of the notes varies. The U.S. Government believes that most likely most of these notes were produced in North Korea.  Over $35 million of $100 bills were produced by British criminals arrested in 2002. Other sources claimed include criminal gangs in Iran, Russia, China or Syria. The name derives from the fact that the quality of the notes exceeds that of the originals.  [verification needed]  More $100 bills circulate in Asia, where U.S. currency is often seen as a safer investment than local currency, [citation needed] and many seizures of supernotes are associated with persons from Korea, Russia, and the Middle East.

Giving them the exclusive power to kill anyone who opposes them. Not that that's happening now.

itsaunixsystem,2pko7m,6d5bc,1 point,Sat Jan 3 09:38:32 2015 UTC,"Section 18. Restrictions on civilian use of article  Global Positioning System:       The U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers. All GPS receivers capable of functioning above 18 kilometers (11 mi) altitude and 515 meters per second (1,001 kn) or designed, modified for use with unmanned air vehicles like e.g. ballistic or cruise missile systems are classified as munitions (weapons) for which State Department export licenses are required.   This rule applies even to otherwise purely civilian units that only receive the L1 frequency and the C/A (Coarse/Acquisition) code.  Disabling operation above these limits exempts the receiver from classification as a munition. Vendor interpretations differ. The rule refers to operation at both the target altitude and speed, but some receivers stop operating even when stationary. This has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach 30 kilometers (19 mi).

Basic additon tasks took at least 100ms because of how terrible the interpreter was. When, according to this, the Z80 processor was actually capable of doing an ADD instruction in one microsecond.  Every byte of a TI-BASIC program had a significant impact on execution speed, especially if it's inside some kind of loop where the delay is cumulative.

If it is broadcom and is not one of the new 802.11ac types (this may have changed in the last year), then hooking the pc up to ethernet and letting the restricted extras helper (which comes up automatically on install) kick in and let Canonical take the wheel.  The only ones where windows was easier are a bunch of XP Era garbage that won't even work in modern windows anyway.  When I installed windows 8.1, the fucker didnt detect my wireless at all and I had to go find the drivers from the manufacturer on ethernet.  Then I had to download the NVIDIA drivers manually, when in ubuntu the restricted driver for that was automagic as well.  My day job is windows admin so of course I know how to do this, and alot of us on this sub cut our teeth on windows, but Windows driver setup can be utterly obtuse if you aren't using an install disk tailored for that exact hardware or have spent years immersed in the damn thing.

Personally, I haven't found any issues finding a job with it, but I do wish it had more of a focus than general IT. I've found that a degree in a technology based field just says you can jump through hoops...not that you actually know what you're doing. If it's a convenient degree to get, I'd say go for it...but make sure you spend extra time on what you want your career to be in.  If you want to do SysAdmin work, which OS do you want to focus on...stuff like that.  I worked at the college I went to, full time at a small wireless ISP the college owned, so I was able to go for cheap. It took me 7 years to get my BS, but I had a full time job the entire time that worked around my school and they paid for 6 credits/quarter.  I graduated with $52 debt."

It all covers what you need in order to go and manage a network or provide support for a network including end user devices.   That being said, our school provides free dreamspark copies of win8/7 (you get to pick!) and I would have been fine with telling her how to get into her account and get her copy of windows. I'd even install it for her, even if it was just to kill a free 30 minutes of class time installing windows."

I talked with Dell's support and they had no idea what was going on.  I did research the issue and found that the video chipset wasn't supported by the kernel at the time.  I was pretty frustrated.  I just ordered a system that was pre-installed with Ubuntu and it wasn't compatible.  I eventually found the infamous nomodeset and applied it.  Eventually, of course, an update was installed that gave me native support for my chipset.   To say the least, I was not impressed."

The upshot is that I am like a computer god to them when I fix any of their problems, and their gratitude is sincere.   The downside is that this type of person typically expects me to fix any of their problems. Including recovering Word files they never saved. It's hard not to sound like a jerk when you have to explain to someone for the third time that if they didn't save their Word document, it's not going to be ""recoverable"" when your computer shuts down because you forgot to plug it in.

Hella fun. If you're into cryptography or puzzle solving at all (or were looking into getting into it), the daily puzzles Niantic puts out (solvable to passcodes that give you items in-game) are definitely a great place to start. http://decodeingress.me has good writeups on some of the more interesting solutions  I guess the really cool thing about Ingress is that there are just so many ways to enjoy it. You can play and capture portals in your city, do intel overwatch for a friend that's making a gigantic field, have drinks with your local faction members (who are usually really cool), meet up with Niantic's cross-country van called NL1331, solve codes and ciphers for in-game items, plan events for your city, create local missions, and probably a lot more.

People also thought jpeg viruses where impossible too, for years until someone made one.  While it would not be possile to exploit a bitmap, jpeg is a series of algorythms, and has a header that can store arbitrary amount of bytes as file metadata(EXIF). Someone actually figured out how to break a certain jpeg handling stack, and get the computer to arbitrarily execute the binary code written in the header.  Since the scanner is basicly doing the same thing, reading an image, and running algorythms, if a weakness was known in the scanning algorythms that caused an arbitrary code execution again its conceviable to assembly and then execute a certain amount of bytes, running parts of the image as code. (presuming the attacker would know how a certain amount of bytes would appear in the program at what location but knowing the physical structure)  Is it plausable as depecited? There are way to many variables that cannot be isolated and predicted to be plausable.  Is it possible in theory? yes.  Far more plausable, but related attack would be an attack on the graphics stack of a cell phone via QR code, that again would run arbitrary code. Thats still for top tier hackers."

But they aren't opening a malformed file specifically constructed by a hacker. They are the ones creating the files. So a buffer overflow attack isn't going to work. The only thing that could be possible is if their software does some analysis on the bones, and is both really advanced in that it would see a pattern in the bones, but at the same time really shitty that somehow you could give it data to analyse and that data would cause it to fuck up really badly.

This is a special case of violation of memory safety.  Buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs that are designed to execute code, or alter the way the program operates. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. Thus, they are the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited.  Programming languages commonly associated with buffer overflows include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows.    Image i     Interesting: Stack buffer overflow | Buffer overflow protection | Stack overflow | Getmail   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,ChasingLogic,28,Wed Nov 19 00:17:32 2014 UTC,Really? Looks identical to Sublime Text 3.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,ChasingLogic,18,Wed Nov 19 00:46:49 2014 UTC,After looking at it again I think I might be wrong. I have only used Sublime 2 which had the curvy tabs. Atom has those blocky looking tabs but the sidebar is all the wrong color. I had to fire up atom and Sublime to be sure of this but I think you might be right.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,Kiloku,6,Wed Nov 19 01:41:42 2014 UTC,"I'm 100% sure it's sublime. I have it open right now, even the syntax highlighting is identical. Atom is also dark background with pretty colors but uses different colors."

itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,Thimoteus,5,Wed Nov 19 00:49:21 2014 UTC,It's a package.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,ChasingLogic,2,Wed Nov 19 01:27:08 2014 UTC,Yes there is an extension called minimap.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,Fidodo,3,Wed Nov 19 01:35:23 2014 UTC,"But that's an extension, I mean built in. Sublime Text has it built in. How can you tell it's atom and not sublime text? From the screenshot, I can't tell the difference."

itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,paul2520,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:01:52 2014 UTC,How is that editor? What would convince me to switch from Notepad++?
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,ChasingLogic,5,Wed Nov 19 05:01:14 2014 UTC,I can't admit to being familiar with Notepad++ as I don't develop on Windows. I would say that the insane amount of packages and ease of installation of those packages could be a good reason but I'm not sure if Notepad++ even has packages.  The fact that it was open source was probably the biggest reason I had for switching.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,paul2520,2,Thu Nov 20 01:03:39 2014 UTC,Notepad++ has plugins.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,ChasingLogic,5,Thu Nov 20 01:28:46 2014 UTC,Yeah like I said I don't even have Windows on any of my machines and it's not available for Linux as far as I know so I've never really used it. I'm sure some blogger has created a great post comparing the two.
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,paul2520,2,Thu Nov 20 01:32:48 2014 UTC,I've heard good things. What advantages does it have over Notepad++?
itsaunixsystem,2mp98d,Fidodo,5,Wed Nov 19 05:01:27 2014 UTC,"There are plenty of features it has that Notepad++ doesn't. My favorite are the quick file changer and the command pallet. The file changer has smart autocomplete for opening other files in the project folder and the command pallet has auto complete for running different commands. Also has very good customization, both style wise and hot-key wise, good default and custom themes, is really fast, and has a great design that does the small details well. Very extensible for eternal commands and has lots of built in commands as well."

(now Apple Inc.) introduced the Macintosh personal computer, later retroactively renamed to the Macintosh 128K model. The operating system of early Macintosh is named ""System Software"" or ""System"", and its ensuing series was later renamed to Mac OS after System 7.  The Macintosh platform is generally credited with having popularized the early concept of the graphical user interface, the main recognizable aspect of Mac OS.  The original Macintosh system software was partially based on the Lisa OS, previously released by Apple for the Lisa computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Xerox Alto, which Steve Jobs and several other Macintosh team members had previewed. Mac OS has been pre-installed on every Macintosh computer made, and has been sold separately in retail stores until being distributed exclusively online.    Image i - Apple marketed its operating system software as ""Mac OS"", beginning in 1997.     Interesting: History of OS X | Mac OS | Mac OS 9 | Mac OS 8   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

itsaunixsystem,2lxw2v,_teslaTrooper,84,Tue Nov 11 06:49:03 2014 UTC,"Microsoft changed the default behavior for auto run on the removable drives as of windows vista. All autorun.ini files are not launched automatically anymore, it still reads the icon and other info from it though but it just parses the autorun file as an option in the usb action dialog. They said it was to prevent people from launching malware attacks using autorun drives; however, I am almost completely certain it was to prevent people from using auto run scripts to change your desktop wallpaper to David Hasselhoff in a speedo. This still worked on windows XP machines at my college and people most certainly abused it, on the computers connected to the large projectors in the auditoriums no less.

itsaunixsystem,2lxw2v,djvita,1 point,Sun Nov 16 23:16:56 2014 UTC,It's not an issue of autoplay. It's merely an issue of the encryption/decryption software he used and how it handles the bundling of multiple files.

itsaunixsystem,2lduss,ApathyPyramid,3,Thu Nov 6 05:05:51 2014 UTC,"Ok, here's a question for you. In the Turkish alphabet the uppercase form of i is İ (I with a dot on top) and the lowercase form of I is ı (i without a dot). If your user is using a Turkish locale and your flags are case-insensitive, should -i and -I do the same thing even though they're not the same letter?"
itsaunixsystem,2lduss,MistakeNotDotDotDot,3,Thu Nov 6 06:51:01 2014 UTC,Are you going to write a case for every single letter in every single alphabet?
itsaunixsystem,2lduss,ApathyPyramid,8,Thu Nov 6 07:05:18 2014 UTC,You use the case-insensitive comparison function of the Unicode library of whatever language you're using.

itsaunixsystem,2ii0d6,square965,18,Tue Oct 7 09:54:03 2014 UTC,"I doubt it. What if the shoot for the phone call scene goes on for more than one take? You have to have a 2nd person offscreen the entire time waiting to make the call, and the actor can't start acting until the call goes through. And even then, if you mess it up, instead of doing another take immediately, you have to get the person to redial."
itsaunixsystem,2ii0d6,square965,6,Tue Oct 7 13:17:37 2014 UTC,"Oh and something else I just thought about, there are so many people on set (especially people who get paid more than whoever is in charge of making sure the cell phone shows an incoming call). If we give a generous estimate of 30 minutes of time for 1 guy to make the call and take the screenshot a few days before filming, I bet that's still MUCH cheaper than even a 5 minute delay during the actual filming."
itsaunixsystem,2ii0d6,T3hUb3rK1tten,16,Tue Oct 7 14:21:55 2014 UTC,"This screenshot technique could have easily worked, too. In the Gallery, if you single tap on the image, the UI gets hidden.  That's probably how the prop guy handed the phone to the actor. He prepped the image, set full brightness, hid the UI, and gave it to the actor, but the actor accidentally tapped the screen in one take and no one noticed."
itsaunixsystem,2ii0d6,headlessCamelCase,10,Tue Oct 7 21:59:09 2014 UTC,He was probably trying to answer the call

The term most often refers to the belief that jurors have come to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials, thereby raising the effective standard of proof for prosecutors. While this belief is widely held among American legal professionals, some studies have suggested that crime shows are unlikely to cause such an effect, although frequent CSI viewers may place a lower value on circumstantial evidence.

itsaunixsystem,2giky2,twofourfresh,9,Wed Oct 1 03:34:16 2014 UTC,"Phew, good that I actually went there and watched the movie!  Proof: http://i.imgur.com/VMob6nv.jpg  Plot:  Basically the movie starts with the incarceration of young hacker Benjamin by Europol and his hearing by Hanne Lindberg. His confession starts with an introduction of himself as the anti-hero, a shy, nerdy and typically unsuccessful guy who just wanted to impress Marie, who he had a crush on since he met her years ago in school.  So he hacks into a university server to get access to the answers to her next test (which she already failed two times). Unfortunately, he gets caught in the act and is sentenced to probation and community service.  And this is where he meets Max, a really cool dude, avid party animal and seemingly successful with women. Max is a high class social engineer who introduces Benjamin to to more hackers, Stephan and Paul. They start hacking - doing a lot of funny stuff, manipulating TV stations (cough Hackers *cough) and having their way with a group of Nazis and can get away from that as well. They decide to call their group CLAY, Clowns Laughing at You.  The members of CLAY are very different personalities, but they all adore a person nicknamed MRX (MRX, not Mr. X), whom they meet in Darknet chatrooms. To impress MRX, they plan to hack into the BND (German Foreign Intelligence Agency) and succeed mostly, but it's still not enough to impress MRX. Instead, they are now being followed by the officials, BND, BKA (FBI equivalent) and Europol.  They find out they are followed and start to erase as much evidence as possible. Still, they are closely followed by Hanne Lindberg, a Europol Prosecutor and Benjamin is finally caught and starts his confession. But Hanne Lindberg is very smart and starts a long research to find out what really happened.  Rating: 8/10, would pirate.  /r/itsaunixsystem worthiness: 5/10. Benjamin has the ability to ""read machine code"", MacBook Airs run some pale X11 window manager that can open a bunch of windows when you type a short command into Bash, it's very easy to shut off the power of some part of Berlin and ""the witness protection program is actually a program"" (quote from the movie)."

The CCC is still growing and has some serious political momentum, the annual Chaos Communication Conference had to move from Berlin to Hamburg so now more than 10000 people can attend and they have local communities in every major city.

A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular  program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding.  Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).

itsaunixsystem,2fcwse,magusopus,7,Wed Sep 3 21:28:59 2014 UTC,"Imperfect solution to an imperfect situation.  My assumptions:    *The Terminator terminator was a non timeline modified model, so Skynet didn't have any real chance to modify behavior as much as T2 and beyond (at least not from our point of view as the audience)  *Terminators are originally set to ""Read Only"" mode when released from factory and occasionally flashed with upgrades as necessary.  A terminator doesn't learn independently from the Skynet system unless set to do so, and, in an incredible sense of irony, given no autonomy from the Skynet AI or other smart control systems and is pretty much just a tool it uses to exterminate humanity.  Connor re programs the one he sends back in T2.  And it is capable of complex learning where the other only seems to be limited to small changes in behavior.   Expansive storage of data, and access to the data doesn't mean all data is utilized by routines or subroutines correctly.  If someone didn't make a function to track ammo then the machine isn't gonna track ammo.  (Knowing what an ""Uzi 9mm"" is, its rate of fire and ammunition capacity doesn't mean someone also wrote a routine to take the same data and properly use it to fill in variables for a function.  Any subroutines would be created to cover the MOST possible scenarios for ""efficiency"".  Why waste process time and expansive data storage of every weapon system ever created when you can simply have it double check for jams, do a quick check to see how much time it would take to change ammunition, and/or just grab the next available weapon if previous constraints weren't satisifed?  Come to think of it, other than the t1000 (much more advanced model)  has there been a case where we see a terminator actually do a combat reload?  (I don't mean a reload while prepping and gearing up, or reloading after stopping and reloading everything all at once, I'm talking reload while actively trying to take out targets.) Any human reactions shown by a terminator  (infiltration specific) are programmed in an attempt to help the terminator trick or belay discovery by humans for as long as possible.   Say I want to hunt down ducks, so I get a duck call.  When I blow on the duck call it sounds like a duck.  But say ducks get smart on my ploy, so now I've gotta not only sound like a duck, but smell like a duck, walk like a duck, and otherwise behave like a duck long enough for me to bag one of the delicious quacking fuckers.  Now in order to do so I'd have to mimic a broad set of behaviors, right?  So say I've gotta act like I'm rooting around for worms.  But not only do I have to look like I'm looking for worms, I've gotta match the behavior of ducks when I do find a worm (last time I stood there looking like I was looking for worms after already finding some and the Ducks got wise.) so I observe ducks rooting for worms but the only place I get to see ducks rooting for worms are in places they've never seen me watch em and aren't worried about discovery (so basically I'm only watching ducks who aren't already wary).  Every time the Ducks find worms they start flapping their wings in a certain way and quacking.   Well now I've got it....I've gotta flap and shit when I find worms and start quacking so I mimic it and it is suitably good at helping me hunt ducks.  So what do I mean?  Well say Skynet wanted to make their infiltrators mimic as many human behavior as observed, but the only case where Skynet ever sees a human reload is when they have a surprised ""WTF!  HOW THE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?!"" pants shitting expression....well the terminators are gonna have those now, because it's a hell of a lot more effective at tricking those damn crafty humans than having the terminator pause for a second before mechanically and efficiently reloading almost the same way each time.  At least until Skynet changes it.  Sigh   Artificial Intelligence doesn't mean thinking like a human.  A machine would focus on efficiency, not the BEST solution, or the most elegant solution.  Bringing back to the choice of a subroutine to match every weapon and their capabilities, or just a basic routine which could work for ANY ammunition fed weapon with minimal recoding and the added plus of tricking humans when paired with a behavioral routine?  No brainer!  Why am I wasting process time thinking abut this? buzz buzz computer brain beeps  I'm the Skynet motherfucker!   The way I see it, a t800 or model 101 (whatever), would be designed based off of a certain number of constraints which are known while limiting the creation of routines for what isn't known. Having backup routines for when a situation doesn't match what is expected is a smart choice, but now we come to elimination of what is functional, what is necessary, and what is elegant.  The machine is gonna go for functional and necessary and probably nothing else.  If a situation arises and creates a neccessity?  New model!  As a side observation.  In the Skynet future a terminator is given the weapons it is expected to use (neat purple plasma pulse rifles the terminators carry...wub wub wub), so there is no real ""necessity"" to hard code anything else on a terminator unit not programmed to learn anything new (at least I'm assuming they are set to read only mode).  The ONE time I can think of in which we've seen a humanoid terminator not look surprised was in T2, where Arnie unloads a motherload of ammunition in a ""nonlethal"" manner against the LAPD using a backpack fed minigun (which we later find is still part of the Skynet arsenal...If you take Salvation or T3 to be part of the mythos).  In the particular case, the terminator pretty much just spun down the barrels right as the ammunition ran dry without an expression of surprise, just an analytical moment as it confirmed there were no fatalities.  Of course he was also modified to learn (assumed to he the human resistance...possibly future Connor himself) so I like to assume most of his behavioral cues were wiped to make room for future learned behaviors, and the WAY it learned different things was probably from someone or some people in the resistance (spinning a lever action shotgun on a finger one handed is a little too flashy for a machine, a human had to teach that behavior....because you know, shit was cool lookin and seemed like an awesome idea at the time.)  My guess is Connor taught Bob by simply having it mimic himself....kind of like what we saw in Real Steel in which Hugh Jackman is actively programming the robot by having it observe his own actions and mimic it while in learning mode.  (The fact Bob continues to learn specifically from the young Connor probably helps the theory)  Edits:  holy corrections batman"

While it certainly should have the ability to monitor the exact quantity of bullets left in its gun, it is only going to do so if it has been programmed to do so. If it's just been programmed to keep firing, then it will. Since it's still an AI it has the ability to encounter new situations and formulate responses, so when it keeps firing and eventually runs out of ammo, it formulates a response on demand. Which apparently manifested as surprise on screen, although I don't remember the scene.  If its AI came up with a benefit to predicting when it would run out of ammo and adjusting its actions accordingly, it presumably would start tracking ammo levels more closely, but in the absence of such a benefit either being programmed in by its creators or having been devised by the AI itself, it has no reason to track ammo preemptively."

itsaunixsystem,2esnfa,Pickitupagain,17,Thu Aug 28 14:22:28 2014 UTC,"Networking is basically a bunch of building blocks, you call it the OSI Model (When training, normally you use a 4-level based one in practice because there's a lot of redundancy in the seven layer one).  Basically, to communicate to me, you're probably using SSL over HTTP over TCP over IP over Ethernet. This means that at the bottom of the pile, you're using Ethernet frames to send the data between computers, this is where the mac address is used, and, is regenerated every time it hits the 'next' node it's talking to (Normally literally right next to it, for instance, your desktop to your router would use a Ethernet frame), so, from me to Reddit, I wouldn't be surprised if the Ethernet frame was made about fifty or so times, and it'd be something like this:-  Frame 1:- Me --> Router, addresses included:- Mine & My router's  Frame 2:- Router --> Modem, addresses included:- My router's & my modem's  Frame 3:- Modem --> ISP's cabinet, addresses included:- My modem's, ISP's cabinet  Frame 4:- ISP's cabinet, {some other router/switch in my ISP's setup}, addresses included:- ISP's cabinet's address & {some other computer's mac address}  {...}  Frame 25:- My ISP --> Tier 1 ISP/exchange, addresses included:- ISP's & Tier 1's.  {...}  Frame 45:- Reddit's ISP --> Reddit's server:- Addresses includes Reddit's ISP's address & Reddit's Server.  Basically, the second that my Ethernet packet hits my router, my mac address is no longer being propagated, and so on and so on. Only the computer right next to the computer in the chain will see the mac address.  P.S. This is highly simplified.  P.P.S. Food is going cold, poor explanation, sorry."

When it reached your wireless bridge, it removed that layers 1 and 2 and re-wrapped everything above for transmission on to your router, which then did the same to pass it on to the upstream router at your ISP and so on.

Once established, a typical DCC session runs independently from the IRC server. Originally designed to be used with ircII it is now supported by many IRC clients. Some peer-to-peer clients on napster-protocol servers also have DCC send/get capability, including TekNap, SunshineUN and Lopster. A variation of the DCC protocol called SDCC (Secure Direct Client-to-Client), also known as DCC SCHAT supports encrypted connections. An RFC specification on the use of DCC does not exist.

OTR uses a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffie–Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function. In addition to authentication and encryption, OTR provides perfect forward secrecy and malleable encryption.  The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniability for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with other cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the participants. In most cases, people using such cryptography software are not aware of this and might be better served by OTR tools instead. [citation needed] The initial introductory paper was named ""Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP"".   The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov. They provide a client library to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted conversations.

However, making it seem static and that the whole city is under one giant private network (with only a few public addresses) is kinda dumb, IMO.

Even with the qualifier of ""well, they can't sniff out the files, but they can sniff out the storage devices"" (thank $deity that's not their claim), it's still a very far-fetched plan bordering (if not having crossed well into) fantasy.  Dogs' noses are impressive, sure, but not sufficiently impressive to determine whether the silicon, plastic, and gold they smell belongs to a memory card or the microwave in the perp's kitchen (for example).  That's being very generous to the idea that dogs can reliably smell silicon, plastic, and gold to begin with.  Memory cards and hard drives aren't like drugs; while drugs tend to be rather noticeable to one's nose, electronics rarely can be ""smelled"" per se (the exception being if you're burning them).  With all the other smells present in a search area that are much stronger, this seems to be a lot of effort for little practical gain.  A better approach would be to use something along the lines of ultrasound for non-destructively examining the presence of hidden storage devices (since that seems to be the idea behind this: to identify whether or not there are hidden storage devices in walls, furniture, etc.).  Even this isn't completely surefire, but it's still more surefire than expecting a police dog to be able to identify a memory card out of the thousands of other, much stronger smells the pup is smelling."

itsaunixsystem,2a7y0e,northrupthebandgeek,3,Thu Jul 10 04:27:29 2014 UTC,"The first part of that is common sense.  If a perp were to hide his kiddie porn in a microwave or thermostat or some other place where there's already electronic components, there's very little to differentiate it by smell alone; you have to know the structure and arrangement of those components - which is where my recommendation for ultrasound-based scanners comes from.  The second part is based on how olfaction works.  Something can be smelled if it's actually releasing oderant molecules (i.e. molecules that will actually activate an olfactory receptor) and if those molecules are actually reaching an animal's olfactory receptors.  Not every molecule is oderant; most ""smells"" consist of volatile organic compounds, non-volatile proteins, and non-volatile hydrocarbons.  When looking at those three categories - and the elements of electronic parts that would need to be smelled in order to have any chance of being identified by smell alone - silicon and gold are ruled out right away, as they fit into none of those categories.  Silver, copper, and lead - the three remaining metals commonly found in electronic devices - would also be very difficult to detect for the same reason.  There are a few scattered stories of gold and silver prospectors trying to train their dogs how to sniff out gold, but it's not a road to riches by any means.  What can be potentially smelled is plastic, being hydrocarbons.  However, this doesn't help us much; the same plastics used when making electronic components can be found in a plethora of household items.  Electronics plastic isn't special in comparison.  That approach would lead to lots of false positives if going by smell alone, and thus lots of wasted time.  Another possibility would be capacitors, depending on the dielectric used.  However, this relies on those capacitors failing sufficiently badly to actually be releasing dielectric substances, and if that's the case, then you'll have a very hard time recovering useful data off those storage devices.  Resistors are another option, depending on the technology used.  Most modern electronics - and virtually all modern data storage devices - use surface-mounted components, resistors included.  Unfortunately for our electronics-sniffing dogs, there's quite a bit of variation in technologies and materials used on modern circuit boards; between potential candidates (like printed carbon resistors) and probable duds (like thin and thick film resistors, which use metals exclusively and probably wouldn't produce an odorant), this approach, too, is a crapshoot at best.    What the dogs probably are able to smell aren't the electronic devices themselves, but various scents from the devices' owners that stuck to the devices (in the case of devices holding pornography, it should be pretty obvious what those smells might be from).  This isn't entirely foolproof, though (since those scents probably stuck to other things as well); I suspect the few successes reported are more attributable to luck than anything else."

itsaunixsystem,2a7y0e,flyinghamsta,3,Thu Jul 10 06:10:03 2014 UTC,"You're not smelling pure copper when you're smelling a penny (it would need to be a vapor, and your penny would need to be really hot in order for that to happen at any appreciable quantity).  You're more likely smelling at least one of several things:   Copper oxide (resulting from contact with atmospheric oxygen) Galvanic corrosion (resulting from contact with other metals, particularly keys, other coins, etc.) Oils and such left behind by your (or others') fingers from handling the penny   The former two are possible because they can easily be rubbed off and become particulates, and also have a lower temperature at which you begin to see a useful amount of vaporization.  Unfortunately for our circuit-sniffing dogs, these things aren't very common in their targets:   In the case of memory cards, the circuit boards are enclosed in a plastic enclosure, which reduces opportunities for oxidization to occur. Virtually all modern PCBs are made with various means of plating and coating in order to additionally prevent oxidization. Oxidization and galvanic corrosion might still be possible even with those two countermeasures in place, but that tends to affect the electrical properties of the copper, causing all kinds of problems with electronic components - and ultimately compromising data integrity, making any ""evidence"" worthless and useless.   This leaves ""oils and such"" as a possibility, which (as I mentioned before) is probably what these dogs are actually picking up on.  It wouldn't be on the copper, though, but on the plastic casings.  It also wouldn't be immune to a good scrubbing with alcohol or soap (the perp taking care to avoid electrical contacts in the process)."
itsaunixsystem,2a7y0e,autowikibot,2,Thu Jul 10 06:44:20 2014 UTC,"Section 15. Plating and coating of article  Printed circuit board:       PCBs  are plated with solder, tin, or gold over nickel as a resist for etching away the unneeded underlying copper.   After PCBs are etched and then rinsed with water, the solder mask is applied, and then any exposed copper is coated with solder, nickel/gold, or some other anti-corrosion coating.    Matte solder is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface or stripped to bare copper. Treatments, such as benzimidazolethiol, prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface.  This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU and US, which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60ppm germanium.

itsaunixsystem,28ghn1,lenswipe,7,Wed Jul 16 03:10:38 2014 UTC,"E (mathematical constant):       The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. It is approximately equal to 2.71828,  and is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series      The constant can be defined in many ways; for example, e is the unique real number such that the value of the derivative (slope of the tangent line) of the function f(x) = ex at the point x = 0 is equal to 1.  The function ex so defined is called the exponential function, and its inverse is the natural logarithm, or logarithm to base e. The natural logarithm of a positive number k can also be defined directly as the area under the curve y = 1/x between x = 1 and x = k, in which case, e is the number whose natural logarithm is 1. There are also more alternative characterizations.  Sometimes called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, e is not to be confused with γ—the Euler–Mascheroni constant, sometimes called simply Euler's constant. The number e is also known as Napier's constant, but Euler's choice of the symbol e is said to have been retained in his honor.  The number e is of eminent importance in mathematics,  alongside 0, 1, π and i. All five of these numbers play important and recurring roles across mathematics, and are the five constants appearing in one formulation of Euler's identity. Like the constant π, e is irrational: it is not a ratio of integers; and it is transcendental: it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. The numerical value of e truncated to 50 decimal places is   2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995... (sequence A001113 in OEIS).

If you have a scene where a hacker is trying to ""bounce his IP"" through several addresses, you wouldn't have enough.

The fact that ""the audience won't know the difference"" applies to both solutions.  C1) It's fiction. It doesn't matter. The audience isn't going to know.   C2) I use it.   C3) I use it to connect to services outside of my internal network.  C4) The 90s just called, they want their dismissive attitude to IPv4 exhaustion back.  C5) The IANA has no /8s left to allocate.

itsaunixsystem,28ghn1,akcaye,9,Wed Jun 18 16:59:41 2014 UTC,"I would prefer that to be the future over ipv6 :(   Why? The equivalent IPv6 address to 2.718.281.828 is 2:2CE:119::33C, which isn't much harder to write.  The IPs in the pic are at least 40-bit, instead of 32-bit IPv4.  It would require upgrades of all software exactly the same way that IPv6 does, but provide significantly less address space.  To keep the same written format (1.2.3.4) but increase to 128-bit, we'd have to have IP addresses like:  4294967295.4294967295.4294967295.4294967295  (43 characters)  Compare vs the biggest possible IPv6 address: FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF (39 characters).  In reality, IPv6 is fairly simple:  he.net has IPv6 address 2001:470:0:76::2   The first 4 segments (2001:470:0:76) are the network.  The last 4 segments (""0000:0000:0000:2"", abbreviated as ""::2"") are the host.  So if you have a home network, you can still number your hosts ::1, ::2, ::3, and just have to memorize the network segment.  Just like with IPv4 where you can have .1, .2, .3, and you just have to memorize the IPv4 network segment (192.168.0).  Everyone gets a whole network!  No more NAT!  For security, your router can (and should) still do stateful firewalling like it does today; it just won't mess with the addresses."

Vi and emacs were born in the days before GUIs existed. They both attempted to solve the same problem: make coding on the command line better. Before they existed things like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, project explorers, and many of the other commonalities of modern IDEs didnt exist. Both vi (and its counterpart vim) and emacs sought to find ways to add these capabilities to command line editing. However, since the screens at the time had very few pixels to add extra interfaces with, and since the field of UX was none-existent during their birth, both editors became immensely complex to use.    Vim's attempt to add functionality was by becoming a modal editor, meaning it functions in two modes: insert (meaning if you type an ""J"", an ""J"" will be inserted where your cursor is), and normal (a very abnormal mode - every key is a hotkey. Here's a basic cheat sheet of vim commands. As you can see from the sheet, typing ""J"" means ""go to the end of this line and delete a single carriage return (or equivalent control codes)"" - A ""J"" will not be added to the text youre working on. Not only that, but the hotkeys work together to become a language - one with verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Typing ""ggf;DG"" for instance means ""go to the start of the document"" (gg), ""set the cursor after the first ; you find"" (f;), and ""Delete until..."" (D) ""The end of the document"" (G). Because of the sheer amount of keys on a keyboard, all of them being a different hotkey in vim, and that they have to be combined correctly, vim's learning curve is often referred to as a sheer cliff.  Emac's stayed away from being a modal editor, and instead relied on chaining the modifier keys ctrl, alt, shift, and meta. Some commands were simple, sensible, and similar to ones used today (ctrl+s). However as functionality bloomed and due to the ease in which emacs could be modded, it quickly scaled out of control. With four modifier keys, and 50 or so standard keys to modify, you were looking at potentially 50 * 24 = 400 hotkeys; of which emacs users were more than eager to fill up. Ctrl+alt+meta+shift+x is probably a hotkey for something. Emacs nears on turning your normal keyboard into a chorded keyboard. The absurdity of the commands is detailed in this XKCD comic: http://xkcd.com/378/  Because of the complexity of each, users often only learned a single editor. This heavily divided the unix community. Each side only saw the power of their own editor (which clearly meant they were superior), leading to many, many flamewars. Because lets face it - its not like people had anything better to do then fight over text editors."

I don't know an extreme amount about computers, but I do know quite a bit about television, photojournalism, and news broadcasting. I think that you're being unnecessarily harsh against the people in that vid.   They're far from the sheltered kiddies you make them out to be. In fact, they probably had very little control as to what they could say in this news segment. The point of the news is to convey information to a near-lowest common denominator, so clearly they can't talk about anything more complicated than 'we do hacker shit' to a very broad audience. At the same time, they need to find a way to satisfy whoever's filming and managing the segment and keep the audience interested with concepts they can understand. Often times, people being interviewed by local news will be given a set of things they can talk about instead of explaining what they want; other times, it'll be judged based on whether or not an older manager can understand it.   It's kind of short-sighted to rant about how something is presented on TV. I would expect people who are smart enough to master computers to be able to see past the curtain. I'm sure these guys can hold their own water 'in the real world', so hold your horses."

He copies an IP address and pastes it somewhere else and now he's hacked into the bad guy.  The big issue here is the ip addresses like 172.28.46.01.328- they are supposed to only have four parts- 192.168.1.1, and each part only goes from 0 - 255, so .328 is just ridiculous.

In a scene in the film, the character Lex Murphy, played by Ariana Richards, finds a computer displaying the interface. She exclaims ""It's a UNIX system! I know this!"" and proceeds to restart the access control system, locking the laboratory's doors.

NCP provided services comparable to the Data Link Layer and Network Layer functions in the OSI model of a Wide area network.   The original IBM Network Control Program ran on the 3705 and supported access to older devices by application programs using Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM).  A subsequent version also supported access to Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networks, initially only by application programs using VTAM and later by application programs using Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM). This was the basis for the subsequent versions that ran on an IBM 3704, 3705, IBM 3725. IBM 3720, or 3745. It caused the machine to become an SNA Physical Unit Type 4 (PU4). A PU4 usually had SDLC links to remote cluster controllers (PU1/PU2) and optional SDLC links to other PU4s. Polling and addressing of the cluster controllers was performed by the NCP without mainframe intervention.

One of the main reasons these ranges exist is to avoid accidentally using real phone numbers in movies and television programs because viewers frequently call the numbers used.  Tommy Tutone's hit 1982 song ""867-5309/Jenny"" identifies a working number in many area codes which continue to receive large numbers of misdialled calls asking for ""Jenny"" decades later.  In 1992, filmmaker Michael Moore unwittingly included footage of himself reciting his telephone number in the documentary Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint. He received 314 phone calls in just the first day following its broadcast on PBS.   The makers of 2003 film Bruce Almighty used 776-2323 which remains unassigned in 1-716 Buffalo (where the film is set). 776 is not a fictitious exchange in other area codes, where subscribers with the matching number were inundated with callers asking for ""God"". In Colorado the calls were misdirected to KDMN radio; in Sanford, North Carolina the number belongs to a church. 776-2323 was ultimately replaced with a 555 number for television airings of the movie and on most copies of the DVD.  In 2014, Russian snowboarder Alexey Sobolev received over two thousand text messages in a few days after printing mobile telephone +7-9250222285 on a helmet worn during the Sochi Olympics.

'Host unreachable' '100% packet loss' etc.  • As retribution, he's trying to crack mainframe@fbi.gov using a program called BRUTEFORCE. But it's only a 30 day trial.  These examples are not plot points in episodes past or present, or anything you see Krieger actively doing. They're just throwaway filler for the screens at his desk. Like I said, I'm just told to make sure the screens are 'on'."

For example, my current prompt on my linux box:  splice@gandalf:~$  My username is splice, the box's hostname is gandalf, and ~ indicates that I'm currently in my home folder. This is configurable and can be switched around and formatted to match a user's preference.  The bolded part can for Krieger's command prompt can be interpreted like so: KR-1 is the server name, ~ is the current folder and is an alias that means it's the home folder, and KRIEGER is the username.   When the ""chown -R US ./base"" command includes ./ as an alias for the current folder, the ~ character in the command prompt tells us it's the home folder of the logged on user, and KRIEGER tells us it's Krieger that's logged on so it's his own home folder.

Even though it was never developed to a fully functional file manager, it gained some fame after it appeared in the movie Jurassic Park in 1993. In a scene in the film, the character Lex Murphy, played by Ariana Richards, finds a computer displaying the interface. She exclaims ""It's a UNIX system! I know this!"" and proceeds to restart the access control system, locking the laboratory's doors. After the release of the film, some perceived the visualisation as an example of media misrepresentation of computers, citing the computer game-like display as being an unrealistic Hollywood mockup.

We convert the numerical value into base 10 to get the usual human read IP like 127.0.0.1 although if we wanted to write that out in binary it would look like this: 01111111000000000000000000000001  IPv6 is 128 bit, so we represent that with hex digits instead of the normal decimal separated by dots, which are base 16 rather than base 10."

They are read left-to-right.  To calculate the number represented by the IP address, use this formula:   (Octet1 * 2563 ) + (Octet2 * 2562 ) + (Octet3 * 256) + Octet4   For example, using the IP of the reddit server I'm using to post this (23.3.75.72):   23 * 2563 = 385875968  3 * 2562 = 196608  75 * 256 = 19200  385875968 + 196608 + 19200 + 72 =  386091848   tldr: The OP shows an IPv4 address with two of the four octets being much larger than 255 (which is impossible, see footnote 2).   1: a 32 bit (4 byte) unsigned (positive) whole number between 0 and 4,294,967,295 (inclusive).   2: a 8-bit (1 byte) unsigned (positive) whole number between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

itsaunixsystem,1tcx3u,M_Night_Shamylan,1 point,Tue Mar 25 01:58:15 2014 UTC,"You can apply an electric current to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas.  The problem comes in when you could travel many times farther off the used amount of electricity then the hydrogen and oxygen gas.  You can actually do this at home! Get a 2 liter, a spark igniter (grill sparker or lighter sparker), two water submersible conductors, a straw, hot glue, and a DC power source.  Cut a hole in your 2 liter cap the size of your straw, put the straw in so it hangs down as low as possible and  hot glue around straw to seal the edges with the cap. At the very top of the bottle push a pin in (use thimble or pliers and heat) for the spark igniter wires to fit in. Make sure they have a very close and blue spark for best ignition before gluing and sealing them too.  Finally at the bottom your 2 conductors, I used the carbon core of old zinc-carbon batteries. (Please make sure you know what you are doing before damaging any battery! Some contain corrosive chemicals and lithium batteries could catch fire or possibly even explode!) Thick metal works too, but it degrades quickly and contaminates the water making it nasty. Make two holes at the lowest part of your bottle on opposite sides, fit your conductors in and glue strong and water tight ,leaving enough room to attach wires to on the outside!  Now test for leaks, put in a small amount of water and see if it leaks out. If it doesn't, great! Fill that thing up with water until the top, screw on the straw/cap combo and you are ready to go! When you wish to ""charge"" up apply a DC source to your two bottom conductors. Electrolysis will break apart oxygen and hydrogen molecules, you should see little bubbles form on your anode and cathode shortly. As the bubbles detach and float to top and get trapped under the cap they take up room. The increased pressure will push water up through the straw to relieve that pressure. If your cap and straw are not sealed properly your gas mix will leak out of that gap instead of push water up through the straw.  Warning! At this point you now have a combustible gas mixed with the proper amount of oxygen! Fortunately, it isn't under pressure at the moment and is only a small amount.  Whenever the water level gets pushed down past the ignite wires you can ignite the mix. A very quick reaction happens. The spark ignites the gas air mix and in a brief flash it burns from a separate hydrogen and oxygen right back into water! The brief pressure surge force water out through the only hole, the straw, to squirt water high into the air!"

I'm reaaaally trying to wrap my brain around what kinda ""proxy"" it's referring too, since it's really just a direct connection to a server from a remote location.   I can kinda see what he's trying to get at with ""cloning login form"", in that if it's not SSH done right he could just send out any signed certificate he wants (or no certificate), therefore allowing him to imitate the server the person is intending to access.  TBH I was kinda flabbergasted to see anything open source getting recognition in the media. But alas, the guy was still stuttering over his words trying to make sense out of em, and half of it was just the usual nonsense."

No, that is not what open source means nor is it true. Big companies such as Google, Red Hat, Mozilla, Oracle, IBM, Novell, and even Microsoft (Hypervisor) and Apple (WebKit, CUPS, Darwin) often pay their employees to work on open-source projects. That's how much of open-source development gets done. I read years ago (can't remember where) that most development on the Linux kernel, for example, is done by people who are paid to work on it.  Here's a definition of open-source and here's a definition of free software (free as in freedom, not necessarily free as in price).
