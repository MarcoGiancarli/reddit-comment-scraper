azunyan,391eci,Nxperience,3,Mon Jun 8 16:35:11 2015 UTC,To bad someone had to ruin this for everybody before all this i was watching the poll every half an hour and i thought i was going to win :/ but o well better luck next time i guess. Congratzz /u/Nxperience!
azunyan,391eci,DailySimon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:19:18 2015 UTC,Ow and just a side repost: It seems the whole system could be corrupt and that multiple people have cheated because without me the total amount of votes = 177 + 54(By 259tim) = 231 + the amount of actual votes counted after 1:00(That's when it all started(You can see it on the timeline)) = +25~ = 256ish and i don't think more than 80 people have been online on this subreddit for the last 2 days so there seems to be a huge surplus on everyone's votes :/
azunyan,391eci,DailySimon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:21:23 2015 UTC,Best thing about this is that 15:00 7/6/15 i had exactly 54 votes so it happen sometime after that. Anyone happen to know how late it would be in America around 20:16? That's right 15:16~ so i can confirm together with the geograph that i don't like whales and that one twat in America :3

I'll be using those images later to recreate the winning banner.  Sorry, but /r/azunyan logo will have to stay for the moment.

azunyan,35i5v8,DailySimon,2,Sun May 10 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Well you can submit a free ad to /r/subredditads if you want so we could consider that, many of our subcribers are from /r/k_on though and those bases kind of overlap so we ran out of momentum from there.  I feel like we shouldn't grow too fast though, that can ruin the sub.  Oh, edit: You could post some of your posts on /r/awwnime and add to your comment that you xposted it from /r/azunyan  Although you have to make sure they haven't been posted before in 6 months time or have been in the top posts, can't make multiple posts either so I'd change the title if you were to do that. And you also have to link to the original source/creator otherwise it'll be deleted."
azunyan,35i5v8,259tim,3,Sun May 10 18:45:31 2015 UTC,Yea i understand what you mean and by my statement i didn't mean like 2000 people just something near the range of 1/2 people a day. And what i meant by 'events' something like a contest or a thing we could all 'profit' from with a laugh or two. -SimonDaily
azunyan,35gdqd,DailySimon,5,Sun May 10 02:25:36 2015 UTC,I think we would benefit from more discussions on why Azusa-chan = best girl.
azunyan,35gdqd,wildcatoffense,3,Sun May 10 05:21:16 2015 UTC,Ah yes ofcourse! But why? Don't we already know that it is a fact! You see the fact is she isn't only 'Best girl' but lost of other things as well if you want i can discus about that with you (∪￣ ㋓ ￣∪)
azunyan,35gdqd,LibraryNerdOne,3,Sun May 10 12:01:26 2015 UTC,"Hi DailySimon,   We are glad to have you here at /r/azunyan/. We are always open for suggestions and open for discussions. So like /u/DailySimon said ""Lets chat a little."""

azunyan,2xlwbs,LibraryNerdOne,2,Wed Mar 4 04:04:27 2015 UTC,Great question.  The banner should be 1920 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.  The minimum image resolution is 72 pixels. The higher the image resolution the better.
