Boxing,3e2ag2,Effective_Aggression,9,Tue Jul 21 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure Bradley will take him up on the offer. Unless Bradley cannot find another fight. Bradley took a beating in that fight, and was lucky to not have been knocked out in round 12"
Boxing,3e2ag2,BigBearChaseMe,8,Tue Jul 21 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"He took a beating because his instinct is to make it a brawl. He's an excellent boxer with speed and a great Chin, but i dont think he will make that mistake again, I'm sure the rematch will be one-sided in Storm's favor."
Boxing,3e2ag2,PM_meyour_banana,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:31 2015 UTC,Especially when he was knocked out in round 1.  He was out on his feet.
Boxing,3e2ag2,sambronson,0,Tue Jul 21 17:20:00 2015 UTC,you make bradley sound like a bitch. If mayweather didnt give maidana a rematch we would never heard the end of it but since provo knocked bradley half retarted its cool for him to duck. But he wants to fight GGG at 160.
Boxing,3e2ag2,johnnybiggs15,5,Tue Jul 21 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"Not my intention at all. I love watching the guy. Bradley stated that he was sluring his words for two weeks after that fight. Unless the payday was too great to pass up, I cannot see him taking that fight.   Bradley may be a out and out brawler, but he is business smart and is mindful of his health and career."
Boxing,3e2ag2,BigBearChaseMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:27 2015 UTC,Well after that fight Bradley beat other fighters whereas Maidana hasn't even been active. And I think Mayweather did that on purpose somehow to allow the first fight to be close to make $80M off one man in 2014   Edit : plus provodnikov lost twice more

Boxing,3e2ag2,ShishouMatt,4,Tue Jul 21 13:29:57 2015 UTC,In theory it sounds fun. But I think Bradley might opt to just outbox him this time instead of making it a life-or-death match.
Boxing,3e2ag2,-Teekey-,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"I would have said that exact thing before seeing Bradley's last couple fights.  I'm not really sure what's going on with him, he's proven to be a very good fighter, but he's not showing it recently.  I'm going to quote a friend of mine who just said ""Bradley who's getting in a fucking car wreck every time he climbs through he ropes"".  I'd be worried for him in a Provo fight, considering how he's looked recently."
Boxing,3e2ag2,-Teekey-,3,Tue Jul 21 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think he just feels pressured to be 'exciting' to stay relevant after the Pacquiao fights. Probably a little machismo as well, when people question his power. He feels compelled to try and prove them wrong.  We saw in the Marquez fight that he is truly talented and can box circles around most A-level fighters."
Boxing,3e2ag2,crookedvision,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:10 2015 UTC,Bradley will do this in a heartbeat.  He can easily get this to Staples and sell out the joint with Mikey Garcia return on the undercard.

Some fighters have a better/easier time learning it than others.  However, it is most definitely a learned thing and can be taught.  With practice, you can get pretty darn good at it.  It DOES take a lot of effort and hand eye coordination, however, and - again - some fighters really do have a natural aptitude for it over others and make it look just SOOO frickin' awesome...like these guys in the video.

Boxing,3e17cj,avinasser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:17:29 2015 UTC,"I hope that is true, but losing, even to Golovkin, would probably take him down a notch in terms of revenue. Not sure what kind of money a Golovkin-Lemieux fight would generate, but I'd say the dude deserves a hefty sum for that belt."
Boxing,3e17cj,johnnybiggs15,6,Tue Jul 21 08:23:11 2015 UTC,name 1 fighter whos stock went down after a GGG loss. curtis stevens fought his way to another title shot. How many big fights did gab rosado get. Geale got another title shot even though it was at a fake weight. Anyone think willie monroe jr hurt his name by losing to GGG.

Boxing,3e17cj,FoneTap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:55 2015 UTC,"we'll see.  Strike 1. Bute failed miserably against Froch. It's in the way he failed, he was mercilessly blown out of the water. The more hard core fans shake their head as Bute tearfully apologizes.  Strike 2. Bute returns and struggles against Grachev. Casual fans now understand something is seriously wrong.  Strike 3. Bute/Pascal is a brutal, brutal disappointment. Bute throws virtually nothing for 11 rounds. His long time coach, completely fed up and discouraged, dumps him.  Bute then attempts then fails to train under Freddie Roach.  And now Bute choses a complete nobody for his last chance return ? Even the radio sports casters know it... Bute needs to knock this guy out in brutal fashion to even be included in any conversation about an important fight...  Many of my friends, local, hardcore boxing fans... are actually boycotting the fight."
Boxing,3e17cj,Ghanni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:24 2015 UTC,I'm as surprised as you are but he still manages to sell tickets here. Was mostly just responding to back up Poon in saying Canadian fans are supportive for better or worse.

Boxing,3e1j1m,hi_imryan,9,Tue Jul 21 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"I've never bought the idea of Garcia having top-tier power. Where's the proof of his crushing power? Knocking out glass-chinned Amir Khan? Knocking out an old, fat Erik Morales? Rod fucking Salka? Close as it gets to real proof of his power is the knockdown against Matthysse, but that was more an accumulation of punches than anything else.  Don't get me wrong: he's an excellent fighter. I just don't think we're dealing with a 140 lb Golovkin or Kovalev here."
Boxing,3e1j1m,MDA123,5,Tue Jul 21 12:04:01 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this a lot but usually get downvoted for saying Garcia has good power but nothing insane with 17 KOs in 30 wins for a 57% rate.   Look at a guy like Mayweather, he had a 66% KO ratio in his first 30 fights, and we all know Floyd fought way better competition in his first 30, becoming world champ in 2 years into his career and fighting world title fights ever since, as opposed to 5 years for Garcia. And he isn't even considered a KO artist at all, an anti-KO artist if anything.  I mean Garcia ain't no Maidana who won 31 of his 35 wins by way of KO, Maidana has more KOs than Garcia has wins.   Fully agree with this statement:   Don't get me wrong: he's an excellent fighter. I just don't think we're dealing with a 140 lb Golovkin or Kovalev here.   Anyway I'm sure he'll get some of his power back when he doesn't have to cut as much. He's overdue to move up and has been struggling to even make the catchweight fights he picks because he can't do 140 anymore. I get the same thing when I'm on a cut and deadlifting or squatting, it's just one big struggle to maintain strength, explosiveness and endurance when you're constantly putting your muscles on a diet. But at 147 they can take a punch better, too, so I don't see him suddenly knocking people out again, especially because there's a ton of boxing IQ at 147 he'll have to be facing, guys that can out-jab him, time him, have better movement and see his big looping shots coming from miles away."
Boxing,3e1j1m,IkmoIkmo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:17 2015 UTC,Take away his left hook.. then he doesn't seem all that dangerous at all. To be honest I do see room for improvements in Garcia maybe if he would get a new world-class trainer perhaps?
Boxing,3e1j1m,the_timeisnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"Same, this boxing style is a problem for him, a jab, movement and avoiding counters is going to make him look terrible. Idk if Paulie has enough left to trouble him but if DSG doesn't show an improvement towards that kind of style it's not going to look good. Plus Paulie's only good clean win in 3 years or so has been Zab, he squeezed past Cano and Broner squeezed past him, and then Porter just demolished him, so DSG better look good if he wins."

Boxing,3e0jea,no1113,0,Tue Jul 21 20:31:21 2015 UTC,I'm going to put Paul Williams here.  I feel like his fights need to be remembered. 6'+ welterweight that the 100+ punches a round.
Boxing,3dy3vu,SFThirdStrike,12,Mon Jul 20 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"I think a focused Nonito beats them all aside from Rigo, obviously. He is a stylistic nightmare for anyone that doesn't have a steady jab and enough pop to keep him off. They would really good fights to tell you the truth. Super Batmanweight and Featherweight are really hot divisions right now."
Boxing,3dy3vu,IAmBecomeBreath,5,Mon Jul 20 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"I think if we get a focused Nonito who continues to display the skills we saw this weekend, then I agree with you.  I think he can even give Rigo a better fight this time around, but I'm not gonna go as far to say he would win.  Overall, the other guys in the division are just not on the same level."
Boxing,3dy3vu,SSJZoroDWolverine,4,Mon Jul 20 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"Let's make this simple. Anyone not named Rigo is potentially getting destroyed by Donaire in his natural division. He has this absurd advantage of speed and power. The only reason Rigo made it, is due to his otherworldly skill. Still, Donaire in one of his best nights can give him feats he's never seen before."
Boxing,3dy3vu,sleeplessrevolution,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"I'm probably one of the only people who rates Mares really highly, I think he comfortably beats LSC"
Boxing,3dy3vu,Wxlson,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:01 2015 UTC,It depends which version of Nonito Donaire will show up. boxer puncher donaire > homerun left hook donaire
Boxing,3dy3vu,SwitchSouthpaw,6,Mon Jul 20 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Frampton vs Donaire would be a combination of the embarrassment Donaire felt at the hands of Rigo and the brutalization he took from Walters all wrapped up into one fight, would be fun to watch that's for sure.  Quigg, Mares and LSC all make competitive, interesting and fan friendly fights.  I'd only slight edge Donaire against Mares, and only because of Mares recent career trajectory.    Donaire was built up by HBO as this massive KO artist while he was really feasting on opponents from lower weight classes.  The true assessment of his skills was the Rigo fight, many people learned a lot about both Donaire and Rigo in that fight.    Edit: What's Donaire done post Rigo that makes you think he can hang with ""elite"" or top level opposition?"
Boxing,3dy3vu,Effective_Aggression,7,Mon Jul 20 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"Donaire was a few seconds away from making Walters a ""never was"" and if he had beat him people would've said ""who'd Walters beat anyway"" but knowing who Walters is now you have to give Donaire credit. For the longest time people were saying donaire was picking on smaller guys @22 and that's why he was so successful (I agree) but then you watch the Walters fight and see he almost ko'd one of the best guys in that div too... Believe me you won't find a person around that was more anti donaire/pro Rigo but aside from Rigo I think I favor Donaire over anyone @22 simply because he's freakishly powerful at the weight and because he has more experience in big fights than the other guys. Not a huge favorite... Very slight favorite over all of them."
Boxing,3dy3vu,Stinkybelly,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:40 2015 UTC,"I was at Walters Donaire, so I only had one viewing angle...just stating that as preface because watching on TV affords the luxury of having a better view in most cases.  I don't recall Walters ever being in trouble in that fight, it was a beat down iirc.  Walters was massive and Donaire was feeling the effects of every landed punch, I wouldn't classify that fight as Donaire being   a few seconds away from making Walters a ""never was""   I completely understand there are some circumstances where a fighters stock raises in a loss, Walters/Donaire isn't one of those circumstances though.  That fight showed 2 things   Donaire isn't at the top of the sport anymore Walters is massive for the division (and probably should move up)   Having that big fight experience is helpful for sure, but I think Donaire's best days are in the rear view mirror."

Boxing,3dy3vu,Effective_Aggression,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:59 2015 UTC,I more or less agree. Just pointing out he really was hurt.
Boxing,3dy3vu,MDA123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"Looks like Walters was saved by the bell to me. The two shots Donaire landed didn't land flush but still seriously hurt Walters.

Boxing,3dy3vu,Intl_shoe,4,Mon Jul 20 23:18:48 2015 UTC,Nah bro Walters got REALLY HURT right at the bell pretty much saved. He would've been KOD imo. But he recovered and put in work and got the W
Boxing,3dy3vu,paperball86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"His best days are most certainly in the rearview but I think the same can be said for Mares I don't think LSC is going to have many ""good days"" to begin with and for the rest of the guys I think donaires experience might get him over the hump...  As far as Walters being hurt I believe it was at the end of the 3rd or 4th round he got caught by a big left from Donaire and was hurt BAD visibly shaken up and had to be guided to his corner... You probably missed it live like you said."
Boxing,3dy3vu,Stinkybelly,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:52 2015 UTC,He's really gifted. Why let it all go to waste? I hope can get a trainer to help him develop his skills so he can get back into it.

Boxing,3dy3vu,brackmania,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt Frampton would hurt Donaire (unless his punch resistance has gone downhill since Walters). You have to understand that Walters is a very big guy (much bigger than donaire), and the hardest puncher at featherweight. And Frampton imo doesn't hit much harder than someone like Rigondeaux (who didn't exactly have Donaire out on his feet in their fight) let alone Walters. Plus Frampton is a lot more reckless and takes more chances than Rigondeaux who is strictly a counter-puncher. As a result that gives a lot for Donaire to work off of.  Also this ""feasting on small opponents"" is completely false. Donaire at 122 was only rehydrating to about the low 130s, which isn't unusual for a 122lb'er. And his height is about 5'6"", whereas guys like Quigg and Santa Cruz are 5'7""-5'8"". So nothing abnormal about donaire's fight night weight or height for the weight class. And donaire has knocked down everyone he has fought from 122-126 except walters (but he still had him hurt). So it's ignorant to say that he only hits hard because he fights guys smaller than him.  Truthfully Donaire gets a lot of undeserved hate and criticism. In fact he never really got much love when he was fighting all the top guys at 122 like Nishioka (ranked #2 at the time), Mathebula (ranked top 5 at the time), Vazquez Jr. (ranked top ten at the time), Rigondeaux, etc. Heck, Arce was at least a better opponent than the last two guys Frampton fought (Arce was a former 122lb world champ going into the Donaire fight)."
Boxing,3dy3vu,MrCrickets,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"What's Donaire done post Rigo that makes you think he can hang with ""elite"" or top level opposition?    Well what makes you think guys like Frampton, Santa Cruz, and Quigg can hang with Donaire based on what they've accomplished thus far in their careers? If we're talking recently, well Frampton got dropped twice and hurt multiple times against a HUGE underdog/complete unknown fighter out of Mexico (not ranked in the top ten). Santa Cruz looked less than stellar against his last cherry picked opponent, and truthfully he doesn't seem all that special (just your typical slow plodder). Quigg's best win was Martinez, and even then he didn't looked all that great until he landed that big uppercut.  At least when Donaire is matched with a big underdog/cherry picked opponent he takes them out of there quickly and impressively. Just watch his last fight in Macau or his fight in the Philippines."
Boxing,3dy3vu,MrCrickets,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:25 2015 UTC,You really wanna get into this with me huh?
Boxing,3dy3vu,Effective_Aggression,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. Donaire has a lot of speed and power and great footwork but I always felt that his size was the biggest advantage. Now Rigondeaux is a small guy so imagine how it felt to lose to him. Nonito did not handle it well, you just had to see his Twitter feed at the time. It was pretty bad. Fast forward a bit take away the size advantage vs Walters and he gets KO'd. I think he can still compete at an elite level just he shouldn't rely on one big punch to win a fight like he normally seems to do."
Boxing,3dy3vu,OneTwoFink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:51 2015 UTC,no you are not wrong for having this opinion but nonito is a curious case. if you really look at his career almost the entirety of his success was from fighting smaller fighters. this effected him as a fighter cause no matter what he did he would always connect with one his deadly left hooks at least once but when he fought rigo while he was the bigger fighter rigo was able to avoid his best weapons for most of the fight. i dont know nonito can always end a fight with one hook but i just always saw him as an over hyped fighter that was fighting guys smaller then him. I doubt we will get to find out as top rank is losing its grip of power by the day but i just dont see nonito ever being the class of his division again
Boxing,3dy3vu,OracleEnlightenment,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:12 2015 UTC,he looks like that because of who he has been facing.  he needs to take a major step up from his last few fights.  he looked abysmal against Darchinyan the second time around. Maybe he has gained that spark back but history has typically shown otherwise.
Boxing,3dy3vu,sittingonahillside,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:14 2015 UTC,If he gets his head back together then he easily beats Mares and LSC and is a pick-em against Frampton or Quigg. But at the moment I'm still not totally sure his head is right.
Boxing,3dy3vu,Fahsan3KBattery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"I think he'd give Frampton fits. Frampton was having some issues with Gonzalez and I think Donaire could/would push the envelope a lot more than Gonzalez did. I can't speak on Mares...LSC though? I hope Donaire would be willing to step back up to 126 for a fight with LSC (not that LSC would take it).  No, I don't think you're wrong for thinking Donaire would beat them."
Boxing,3dy3vu,hu_lee_oh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"In recent years he's lost to two fighters: Rigo @ 122 (pure skill, outboxed and fully deserved the win, no shame in that) and Walters (probably the hardest hitter at 126, a division above Donaire's natural weight, also, keep in mind that Walters couldn't even make the weight in his very next fight, which should tell you something about how heavy he was when he fought Donaire). Donaire destroys everyone at 122 imo. Having said that, I want to see him in with Quigg or Frampton to definitively prove he's still got it."
Boxing,3dy3vu,rs1sr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:13 2015 UTC,Donaire puts all those guys to sleep!

If his heart is in it, if he's committed to the sport and to fitness, he's a top contender against any of those guys. What we've seen in recent fights is that he's just not into it like he was two or three years ago."

Boxing,3dy3vu,bran11888,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:21 2015 UTC,I personally give Mares the best chance as well.. I think Donaire in his prime would be too fast and explosive for any of these fighters. But it seems even before the Rigo fight his boxing IQ and acumen had decreased along with his foot speed. He fell in love with planting his feet and throwing bombs. I don't think that Donaire is special enough to compete with the elite 126 lbers and I don't think he would beat Mares either.
Boxing,3dy3vu,Leif9er,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"I think Frampton would dominate Donaire, and at this stage of both their careers, maybe stop him. He'd probably be overwhelmed by the volume of LSC too. The others he'd probably beat."
Boxing,3dy3vu,paperball86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"Naaaaah LSC would feel Nonito ' left hook and his whole swarming style would go out the window. Cmon man give him some credit. LSC can't do his bulls hit vs someone with solid fundementals and serious speed and pop... game changing power... look at Darchiniyan II... Donaire was losing and BLAM KTFO. As for Framptom, Nonito needs a perfect camp for him. Honestly Framptom getting dropped twice in his last fight ,worries me. If Nonito did that, he'd not only be hurt, but Nonito is a finisher..."
Boxing,3dy3vu,Leif9er,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But nothings happened in Leo's career to make me doubt his chin. His opposition has been pretty poor of late so i don't doubt that Nonito's power will give him problems, but if he's up after 12 i reckon he's won. I think that's the issue though, without a knockout i see Nonito losing most of these fights."
Boxing,3dy3vu,RatherPedestrian,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, because he already lost to Walters. Loma would be a difficult win as well."
