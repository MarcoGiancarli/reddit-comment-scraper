This is what consumer societies push for. Making tonnes of shit. Then when it becomes slightly less convenient or profitable, regardless of usability, we destroy, demolish, trash, and waste whatever we have built. Some of these factory looks almost pristine and this was INTENDED to break down.   I am just seeing photo after photo through a fog of doom and gloom predictions for an economically and environmentally unsustainable track. Limited ore resource stretched out over a huge factory and being left to rot while we dig pit mines elsewhere to produce more to make another factory somewhere else where labour rights don't interfere with the bottom line or the CEO's annual bonus.  So on top of the cool urban exploration and seeing the inside of this massive factory and being wowed by how big, and being in awe of industrial architectures vastness, I feel the sting of our culture of waste and destruction and endless consumption feeding into the demise of structures that have barely started their life span.  And why? Because a factory in Mexico could pay slave wages, saving the equivalent of a single car commercial every two years to try to convince everyone to buy a new other thing they don't really need.  Beautiful photos. Tragic waste."

urbanexploration,3djg1q,HydroFracker,9,Fri Jul 17 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"Not bad!  I don't mean to sound harsh but you should work on capturing the environment as it actually is. It will improve your photographic skills by forcing you to make an artistic composition out of your natural surroundings.  I see lots of ""professional"" urbex photographers in this sub that stage their scenes and pretend they found things the way they were photographed.   Their photos are mildly compelling because of the objects they shoot but they look contrived and don't make an emotional impact because they are not finding the ""art"" that occurs around them naturally."
urbanexploration,3djg1q,HydroFracker,9,Thu Jul 16 22:09:29 2015 UTC,This wasn't staged! Friend was walking upto the cross thingy while I took a snap.  Could you please elaborate on capturing the environment as it actually is? Are you speaking about the edit?  Thank you so much for replying.
urbanexploration,3djg1q,HydroFracker,5,Thu Jul 16 22:20:16 2015 UTC,"Sure! I was actually referring to you (I assume it's you) standing in the picture and how you are kind of ""forcing"" the picture to tell a story that doesn't actually exist.  Try telling stories with your images by finding them naturally in your surroundings. Just photographing the cross without the person tells a much more authentic, compelling story.  When you see successful photos that are staged it's because the photographer has spent thousands of hours perfecting their technique and can use those skills to ""paint"" a picture using props. You can get there too! Just keep training your eye to see the beautiful compositions that already exist all around you.  Edit: focus on the first three composition techniques in this link.  http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/10-top-photography-composition-rules  Get those down and every picture you take will be dramatically improved. When taking images look for scenes in your viewfinder that follow these guidelines."

urbanexploration,3dlnq3,capadoo,12,Fri Jul 17 07:25:08 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this for 5+ years and have been in approximately 220 places.   My list of tips:   Do not explore alone if you can help it. Let's face the facts; what we do is a calculated risk. The majority of the time you will explore and nothing will happen. If you explore as long as I have you are bound to have an incident regardless of experience. I just had a team mate almost get injured from a rotted staircase that gave out. If you are alone and something happens you're screwed.  Limit your group. ""What? But you just said never go alone!?"". Yes, you should never go alone if you can help it. But, you don't want a group of 15 going into the same location. It's very suspicious, a lot of noise is generated, it puts more weight on damaged areas and is hard to manage. Five people max to start out with, and that's pushing it.  Stealth and planning is key. I hate to say this but a good Urbex trip is like pulling a good heist. Casing out the joint will be beneficial. Look at the place during the day and the night. Look at who's in the area, are there any lights on, is there power to the building, whats a good entry point, how does the area look via satellite photography, etc? The more research and planning you do the less worries you'll have in the field. Have equipment on hand and make sure you know how to use it. Flashlight, extra batteries, radio, camera, first aid kit, food, water, flares, respirators, rappelling and ascension gear, a good backpack, etc. Every Urbexer should have a go bag in the car filled with these essentials. Know how to use everything in your Urbex bag and put whatever you deem useful inside of it.  Go in the day if possible. Daytime is safer in a lot of cases for both your health and security. At night you have to rely on either a flashlight or a flare. It's a lot smarter to go in the day. If you do use a flashlight at night keep it low to the ground and away from the Windows. If someone sees a light on in the old abandoned psych ward they're going to call the cops. Keep quiet and watch your footing Glass is noisy, so is squeaking wood. Try to avoid making to much noise while exploring. More importantly you should always watch where you're stepping. A hole in the floor is a deadly mistake to walk into. Do not take anything but pictures and video. Seriously. This is the unwritten rule of our venture. We leave nothing but footprints and take nothing. If you remove items you are harming the site and ruining it for future explorers. The only time I have ever taken something was one day before a demolition and I had the property owners permission. Stay out of the drains. The drains kill more explorers than crumbling architecture the majority of the time. If you want to get into draining then do it once you are a pro at Urbexing. The drains are a totally different game and a slip up will kill you. If you ignore this just please remember the cardinal rule of draining; ""If it rains, no drains"". No exceptions, even if it's a drizzle. Avoid carrying items that could be considered ""burglary tools"". You'll read that some explorers carry lock pics, picking guns, crowbars, etc. Hell I once had a teammate bring thermite ""just in case"". If you get caught by police or security with these items you will probably get thrown in jail. Now I do bend this rule because I am a very good lock picker and carry a set on me daily. Lock picking is a useful skill but remember that you're not a burglar, you're an explorer. Besides, unless you are good with lockpicks what's the point in taking the risk?  Learn Parkour. I have been doing Parkour for about five years and it has constantly come into play during my Urban Exploring adventures. I've had to jump gaps, walk across beams and do a great deal of climbing. Parkour is about getting from point A to point B as efficiently and quickly as possible. It's a great hobby and skill that can be developed through a few days of training each week. I once was at an old farm house that only had one possible means of entry. I had to climb up two stories via holes in the foundation and brickwork and then balance myself on a beam for six feet before doing a precision jump onto sturdier ground. Learn Parkour, I highly recommend it. Avoid weapons! Check the legality of self defense weapons in your area. I live in New York and we can't carry pepper spray, tasers, batons, etc. I carry a small Kershaw leek on me and I've found uses for it on every Urbex adventure. Just please don't pull a knife during a fight if you can help it, it never ends well. Watch for squatters. Squatting is the act of living or camping out of abandoned places. Houses, chemical factories, insane asylums, you name it and a person may be living there. Homeless people are not all bad, that's the honest truth. I've met a lot of awesome people doing Urbexing without issue. However, you need to understand that some of these people may be on drugs and not right in the head. If you see a squatter it's best to just back off and give a thumbs up. If I see evidence that someone is squatting I quickly announce ""I'm not a cop, just exploring. If someone is squatting just say something and I'll leave"".  If it's tagged, forget it. L.A. is not a place you want to get involved in a turf war.  Have a girl in the group. This was passed on to me by a friend and it works. If a cop catches you with a girl in the group it usually ends with a warning and not a charge. Sexist? Maybe. Smart? You bet!    If you have any specific questions, need help, or anything at all feel free to let me know. We were all rookies once."

urbanexploration,3dlnq3,mooseknowsall,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"Good point, but anyone in those areas involved in drug trafficking or gangs will have a gun. Also,  if you know how to use a gun you don't go waving it in the open the whole time freaking everyone out."
urbanexploration,3dlnq3,RantSagan,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah good point as well. Make sure you have a Permit for open carry in case you get caught. Urban exploration for the most part is illegal, so there's no need getting in more trouble than you have to."
urbanexploration,3dlnq3,mooseknowsall,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"My favourite saying is ""Don't be stupid, stupid"" oh and ""If it rains, no drains"". Both simple and I haven't died yet. Although my city isn't very dangerous, just be cautious and use your head. Most homeless people are cool with you being there, just announce yourself so that you don't scare them and they know you arn't a cop so say something like ""Hey is anyone here?

urbanexploration,3dgnnv,chelsey-dagger,39,Fri Jul 17 00:06:35 2015 UTC,Probably someone that wants the local law enforcement to do some free remodeling for them.

urbanexploration,3dgnnv,MetalDetectingGuy,7,Thu Jul 16 16:29:48 2015 UTC,ahhh meth. It's a very special kind of concentration. I grew up in an area that crystal was pretty common. I've heard the stories of shadow people.
urbanexploration,3dgnnv,wellitsbouttime,5,Thu Jul 16 07:07:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about drugs or their effects. Can you tell me more about these ""shadow people""?"
urbanexploration,3dgnnv,LaceyGucci,3,Thu Jul 16 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"well I don't work in medicine, and although I love to get down, meth isn't something that I've ever purposefully tried- I add purposefully bc sometimes methamphetamine is cut into pressed pills with extacy to stretch the more expensive chemical MDMA. This is just what I've pieced together from listening to ramblings second hand.  Meth keeps you up for days on end, enough that your body starts to hallucinate. it's also a source of paranoia. You ever see something out of the corner of your eye? well add sleep deprivation and paranoia to the mix, and those things are interpreted as shadow people. a group of mean things out to get you. if someone would like to jump in with a first hand account, now's a good time."
urbanexploration,3dgnnv,wellitsbouttime,5,Fri Jul 17 01:30:01 2015 UTC,I'd like everyone to take a second to appreciate the fact that they used red spray paint.
urbanexploration,3dgnnv,Mohevian,2,Thu Jul 16 07:01:18 2015 UTC,What is the significance of that?

urbanexploration,3dgnnv,china_dont_care,6,Thu Jul 16 07:08:04 2015 UTC,that is a very specific genre

urbanexploration,3dgl0o,EsseXploreR,2,Thu Jul 16 09:57:08 2015 UTC,"The point of urbexing is to blaze your own path, set your own goals and meet them. If you want to sit back and cherry pick easy locations I don't think this is for you.   First of all. Google maps satellite and street view is your new best friend.   Secondly, mark everything you see on your phones map app. See a bando? Star that shit on the map. You aren't tattooing it on your arm, just making a note about it.   Third. Go lurk. Pile your friends into a car and go drive through your city and LOOK for bandos. People also ask me ""Dude how do you find these places?"" I say ""I look more to the left and right when driving than I do forward""   Fourth. Invest in some proper attire. I live in Texas. And I just recently bought me some light weight breathable adventure pants and shirts, wish I would have done that years ago. Get you some sturdy, waterproof hiking boots and gloves and a good flashlight  (the cheap Chinese flashlights on amazon are great for the price)   Fith. Be physically fit. And mentally clear. (Go for runs, don't do drugs or drink while exploring)   Bonus tip. Don't explore with items that look bad to police. Something as simple as a screwdriver can be the difference between a warning and a night in jail."
