More details of the actual infractions included, and from the descriptions it sounds like they were regularly paying for items from this contractor but at a highly reduced rate (i.e. $50 for a dinner valued at $800+).    All 3 in this article have been demoted by several ranks (effectively wiping out their promotion efforts for several years) and retired... but no jail time mentioned.  This has got to be a giant legal gray area for JAG to wade into... they bought things, but the things were worth more than they paid... did they break the law or just breach regs?"

August 5th, 2006 he was killed by a meth head that was passing cars in the turn lane and hit him head on.   His wife didn't realize the bayonet was mine and gave it to his brother who survived him.

Just anecdotally, something I noticed growing up is husbands were just as guilty of encouraging/enabling this behavior.  Many didn't ever want to take the time to truly make parenting a 50/50 split, in many cases, mom cooked, cleaned and watched the kids until dad came home, ate dinner and sat and watched TV.  When any parent is tasked with handling the overwhelming majority of the not so fun aspects of adulthood, you're not really giving your spouse the opportunity to pursue her own hobbies and interests.  But of course, the lazy/shitty dad/mom was in the Army, so, they have an excuse, because nowhere else in the world are parents required to work long hours and still find time for their families."

Military,3e03fn,Hello_Run,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:34 2015 UTC,Psychopathy is not on the DSM-5. No one is diagnosed as a 'psychopath' or 'sociopath' and that checklist is not what a psychologist or psychiatrist would use to diagnose someone with antisocial personality DO. That's all a bunch of quack bullshit.
Military,3e03fn,WendyLRogers3,2,Tue Jul 21 08:19:52 2015 UTC,"Both DSM-5 and ICD-10  ""(state) that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, though distinctions are sometimes made.""  So yes, both psychopathy and sociopathy still exist, integrated into antisocial personality disorder.  Hare's biggest objection to the use of his checklist is the overemphasis on criminality; in that the overwhelming majority of spectrum psychopaths and sociopaths are not criminal."

Military,3dxt5z,SheeEttin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"Not really. They used to be a very aviation specific company, or holding of companies. Controlling the likes of Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Chance Bought, Hamilton Aero, Sikorsky, United Airlines, and others focused on aviation. They were broken up for being a monopoly. Arguably one of the largest ever in the aviation industry. Now though they control things like Honeywell (controls/automation) Carrier (air conditioners), Otis (escalators/elevators), some tool company and I think a tire/rubber company. So, the name change signified how they diversified their investments. What's more ironic is that a reason given for the sale of Sikorsky was so United Technology and Sikorsky could ""focus on their core businesses."" UTC has no ""core"" being invested in everything, while Sikorsky is still very much an aircraft manufacturer. UTC is still keeping Pratt & Whitney though.

Military,3dxt5z,JamesTBagg,7,Tue Jul 21 04:20:47 2015 UTC,Since Lockheed developed the original stealth fighter I would take a gamble that they also developed the addon packages for the stealth chopper. Now they can just sell and build them directly. But who knows.
Military,3dxt5z,Malystryxx,18,Mon Jul 20 16:31:42 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to the stealth helos allegedly involved in the Bin Laden raid, it's more likely the stealth tech was based on the RAH-66 Comanche (A Boeing-Sikorsky venture) than the F-117. So Sikorsky was likely already involved in that project, especially considering they're probably highly modified UH-60s (another Sikorsky product)  I'm fairly certain those helos will remain in their niche, away from the public eye for a good while, and don't expect this acquisition to change that. Considering the purpose-built nature of that project, it's likely that decision is out of LM/Sikorsky/Boeing's hands. Either that, or they never existed in the first place and the ""tail rotor"" was left behind as disinformation for Pakistani/Iranian/Chinese/highest bidder engineers."

Military,3dxt5z,Malystryxx,5,Mon Jul 20 17:15:32 2015 UTC,"No, for two reasons:   LM holds the lion's share of other Task Force contracts already. Those are such a niche, it's probably not as important/valuable as you believe it to be. I doubt there are more than six of those birds in the world, and probably no plans to mass produce them.   I also am speculating as to how much Sikorsky was involved in them. For all we know, LM already holds that contract and received limited help from boeing/sikorsky project managers from the Comanche program, or Boeing holds the contract and will keep it."

Flash is exceedlingly well-researched historical fiction with a heavy slant towards the military, fun reading. McAuslan is semi-autobiographical comedic accounts of Fraser's time in the British Army right after the Second World War, and Quartered is his memoirs from serving in Burma, though he was only there briefly due to his young age.  Military Blunders - Saul David. We learn from mistakes as well as examples.  Under Fire - Henri Barbusse. Memoirs from the Trenches. M. Barbusse served 17 months after enlisting in 1914, before various ailments forced him into a clerical position. He wrote the book while fighting and presented a brutal view of life on the front. He could make even Rumsfeld consider pacifism."

The two designs are quite different, although both satisfy the top-level performance requirements and technical requirements of the LCS program. Both achieve sprint speeds of more than 40kt and long-range transit distances of over 3,500 miles. The Lockheed Martin Freedom-class design is a high-speed semi-planing monohull. The General Dynamics Independence-class design is a trimaran with a slender stabilised monohull.  The sea frames of both designs accommodate the equipment and crew for core LCS missions and special missions. They are both capable of the effective launch, control and recovery of vehicles for extended periods, however the strategy for launch and recovery for waterborne craft and for aircraft are different in the two designs. The two designs also use very different approaches for incorporating reconfigurable internal volume.  The design approach for the second-generation LCS, flight 1, ship acquisition is flexible and will take into consideration the experience gained in the flight 0 designs. In both designs, the sprint speed of 40kt to 50kt results in the body of the hull being lifted out of the water as much as possible. The Lockheed Martin design of the monohull lifts the body of the hull.  The General Dynamics trimaran design, with the slender stabilised monohull, uses two outriggers which move the displacement upwards and reduce the wetted surface. The shaping of the hull in both design strategies gives signature reduction. The designs of both ships continue to evolve with changes in the design proposals.  I hope that clarifies any confusion you have between the vessels. If you have any further questions feel free to ask, we love helping good people out  ;)  -RR"

The dudes that I served with, the ones I saw commit ND, that I know would be the ones arming themselves....The horror! Not to say every ND is a complete piece of shit soldier, but well, most of NDs I saw happen were caused by some of the...interesting individuals.   It's bad enough weirdo/unstable Joe is showing off his nunchucks/throwing stars/butterfly knives. Those will be the majority of guys with firearms on post. I know some responsible sound guys would carry if offered to as well, but I do not believe they would be anywhere close to the majority.  I've only witnessed one that happened where the guy was a known good soldier, just made what most would say is an honest mistake and not just being the typical asshat most other NDs would be. The rest were on firing ranges and typical idiot Joe just got lazy once again and didn't want to fully check that their weapon was clear. Night ranges are the worst for this, in my experience. as they just go through the motions of opening the bolt, but don't feel around in there/get a light in there.   For that one guy, it was stupid that the following occurred though:   NTC at Irwin while in the ARNG as an 11B. Doing one of the last training events. Long march up steep hills full of snakes to sneakily (and carefully, lots of loose shale-like rock) descend upon on a decent sized compound/mock village. Earlier (maybe even the day before) some of us fired live rounds on qual ranges and such.  First assaulting platoons (my part) get their turn before doing a quick reset to allow the other platoon some training. They reload blanks...In the dark...from an ammo can full of loose blanks. First mistake here, as obviously a live round made it in. Thank fucking god we didn't have the civilians involved in this playing targets in the rooms, because next thing you know I'm puling security in the cordon on the South side of the village, and BANG!    I can't say for certain if anyone WOULD have been injured anyway as his BFA and barrel just destroyed the round/got destroyed and the dummy target had no penetration luckily. But fuck, that made a lot of assholes pucker that night. Overall, our assault was fucking great. We were told by the OpFor that we were the first unit to try humping that fucking giant mountain and come down hidden and caught them 100% by surprise and they had to ""revive"" (MILES) every single one of their guys at least once and most 3 times. Also, the next day we completely decimated another company in our bat during a blue on blue event both defending and assaulting an area of this village a little farther West with an environment more like city streets than just a large village/compound. This training was all some of which where I had the most exhilarating fun, and luckily this vibe probably kept us from getting our asses chewed out badly for that ND. Some of the best leadership I had ever had above me during this phase of the unit as well, so it was a very positive time for our unit.  Then, we don't deploy. Good training everyone, you did spectacular, and were noticed. Now, sit at home station doing the shit you hate."

If this line of argument was at all valid, then there is no reason to have a law against murder.  People who think it's immoral just aren't going to do it, and the people who don't are probably going to do it anyhow, so what's the point, right?

The guards don't search every vehicle as it goes through the gate. It is ridiculously easy to bring a firearm on base and nobody is the wiser to it. At no point should anybody be forcibly reduced to sitting ducks. Bases don't have the security to justify gun free zones because they don't have metal detectors or conduct searches on every vehicle upon entry.

Military,3drdvg,Shotgun_Sentinel,7,Sun Jul 19 22:07:13 2015 UTC,I feel we should be allowed to CC from the time we leave our homes until the we reach base and vice-versa.  The problem here is we are not allowed to carry a weapon on base.  This part needs to change and at least allow us to keep the weapon in our vehicle.  Base shootings aren't going to be the real problem. Shootings outside the base and at the gate are going to be the problem.  All uniformed personnel should be authorized to conceal carry and authorized to carry a weapon in their vehicle on base.
Military,3drdvg,AlfredsDad,6,Sun Jul 19 23:46:41 2015 UTC,A weapon sitting in your car will not do anybody any good in an active shooter situation. Closing the doors and hiding under desks makes us literally sitting ducks. It would ease the issue of realizing you have your weapon in the car on the way to work and having to turn around so you don't break any laws.
Military,3drdvg,vinylshrapnel,2,Sun Jul 19 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain I understand what you're saying.  My point is that the biggest possibility for active shooters won't be on a base, it will happen at the gates or, like Chattanooga,  out in town at those in uniform.  Bases, if under attack, have armed security, and while that's reactionary, all action taken against an active shooter is reactionary.   At least being able to defend ourselves should be a priority. We, in uniform, are the prime target.  Allowing us to carry should be a no-brainer.   With federal law as it is, it is impossible for us to CC when we need to most, in transit on our way to work and home.  That was my point."
Military,3drdvg,AlfredsDad,2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see why the gate would be ""the biggest possibility for active shooters"" considering the fact that they can get through that gate with a driver's license and proof of insurance."

We simply need to allow service members who already have their CHL to be allowed to carry concealed while in uniform, on or off base. Issuing recruiters a sidearm for their job would be fine, but just allow everyone else to carry their personal firearms on them if they have the license by their state to do so.

I have a TT malice pack. Bought right before Robin Sage. Take it on every deployment and always get questions about it. I'm an alice fan too. Best piece of gear I have personally bought. My two issued Mystery Ranch rucks both sit around largely unused because they don't compare in my opinion.

Maybe I should have proclaimed my vet status up front, but I hate doing that. So it goes. :/  Anyway, I'm for sure leaning towards the Malice frame over the Down East polymer frame. I'm still hoping someone can give me some insight on the TT vs. Down East suspensions. The Down East certainly looks more comfortable, but people seem to like the TT setup, too.  So, how do you like the TT shoulder and waist straps? Are they comfortable and, more importantly, will they last?"

I would add that the sentiment began in the late 70's with us Vietnam Veterans using the phrase ""Welcome Home Brother"" to one another due to the generally rather hostile reception we received from the american public upon our return to america during the later stages of the war. Pretty much no one was welcoming us home in the US, quite the opposite in fact. So we welcomed one another as a simple act of acknowledgement of one another's having ""been there, done that.""  Eventually, around the mid to late 1980s, the american public's attitudes toward the vietnam veteran begin to ease, then reverse and the general public began using the phrase ""Welcome Home."" In some towns and cities belated Welcome Home parades were held, there was a large one in Washington DC eventually. For a lot of us though all this was a bit late in coming. And I must say that personally I feel that way too and to this day I resent the living hell out of the way we were treated. But I still welcome home those VN vets I encounter, it is a deeply satisfying gesture between us.   You can bet too that I welcome home any vet from our more recent conflicts, one vet to another. I understand though that they are coming to resent the gesture due to being ""welcomed Home"" too often and it bugs them. So I try and be discrete with the phrase, I simple let it be known in other ways that I appreciate their having served because I genuinely do care and I want everyone of them to know that."
Military,3dtmaa,Dittybopper,4,Sun Jul 19 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"You could ask Why do we make a big deal out of birthdays?   We celebrate homecomings because they were missed and we are happy they are home. I don't know what you mean about the people who don't get a homecoming. do you mean people with no family? If so they can still go out and party. Usually there is a ceremony for everyone as soon as you get back.   Now I hate the whole ""show up and surprise a family member with 20 cameras in toe."" I would hate to have that happen to me. I also think it subtracts some from the event, like doing it at a graduation.   It's just something we do to celebrate having a family member back in our lives after they have been gone for months at a time. I can't think of a better reason to party."

Military,3dplmv,OneTimeIsAll,3,Sat Jul 18 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"No. It's part of an exchange program where the US/UK send military personnel to each other. During that time, the US guys are essentially considered part of the UK military, and UK guys are part of the US military; both subject to all laws and orders blah blah blah, etc.  As the article states, there are currently 20 people involved. Most likely naval types, as this is off a carrier. I don't know what the deployment schedule is like (3 month deployments? 6? 12? 18?!) but let's assume 20 people per deployment is an accurate number. Only 20 people per service (let's limit it to army, navy, airforce) get sent on exchange every 180 (or whatever) days. You're looking at about 40 people per year, per service, totaling 120 people per year from the entire MOD.   These kinds of transfers are very rare. Beyond that they are probably fairly prestigious, and something that people actively work towards attaining. If you're worried about getting assigned to a US unit, you can stop. If you want to, then you will need to be proactive and work towards it. Either way, good luck."

To do counter-narcotics in the Carribean, anti-mine operations in the Persian Gulf, anti-piracy in the Gulf of Aden, you'd need 3 DDGs or another ship that would likely be extreme overkill for all of those missions, so we're getting LCS' which are essentially corvettes for those mission sets, to reserve the bigger surface combatants for what they were actually built for. The Navy's frigates shouldn't even be deemed sea-worthy at this point, and the MCMs are old as fuck... so something was needed to replace both of them. We decided on more Flight 3 DDGs to partially replace the frigates, and the LCS to partially replace the frigates, MCMs, and open up littoral waters, which the US hasn't really been in since pre-WWI"

During WW2 women went to the factories and kept America running there is no reason to thing they couldnt have a huge part in a war effort if the time came in a non combative or even combative way if they so desired. Im not saying they should be limited to those non combative jobs but they exist and will need to be filled quickly in the event of a draft."

Ok, this is my issue with the whole thing: the whole approach is wrong, which makes me question her motives.  We have an all volunteer force. At this point the only way you get barred from pretty much any job in the military now is simply being not qualified for it, be that physically or mentally. Female, have at it. Homosexual, who you're attracted to has no bearing on how well you shoot. Transsexual, no one really cares. If you can hack it, you can do it.  This girl is already considering volunteering and is upset that she can't sign up for the draft? Seriously? Who the fuck wanted to sign up for the draft? We all volunteered. We were excited when we signed up, but I don't think anyone here was anxiously awaiting the day when we could finally sign up for the draft. And she thinks it violates her civil rights? Maybe, but is that really the strongest argument you can make? It is much more discriminatory towards men by legally compelling them to do something they might oppose. I think her motives are completely suspect and she's just doing it for attention."

Military,3dl9kd,speedisavirus,37,Fri Jul 17 17:05:41 2015 UTC,She wanted to sign up for the potential to be drafted. Its a lottery system so she is just asking that her name be put in with the other half of America that is already forced to be in the pot. Your right its all volunteer right now and hopefully it stays that way but if a draft comes she obviously thinks it unfair that 50% of Americans get to skate by without any chance of being called up because of a chromosome. Honestly we should applaud her not chastise her. Maybe her motives are wrong but what she is trying to do is not at the very least women should be able to sign up for a potential draft because obviously she feels her nations call is worth answering if that were to ever happen. Women are fighting for all combat roles to be open and the chances of being killed or wounded in those is much higher than other careers so the same logic could be applied there. It seems some people want true equality or are attention seekers but if its the latter it doesnt make it wrong.
Military,3dl9kd,spqr-king,21,Fri Jul 17 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"women should be able to sign up for a potential draft   If we're strictly talking gender equality, it would be a legal requirement, not just an optional thing."
Military,3dl9kd,akpenguin,7,Fri Jul 17 15:52:43 2015 UTC,Her goal is to make the draft gender-neutral: either both men and women should be required to register or it should be voluntary for both sexes.   That's pretty much what she wants.
Military,3dl9kd,electriophile,3,Fri Jul 17 20:22:46 2015 UTC,Thats true but baby steps dont rock the boat so hard. Not all people would be as receptive to the idea as she is and politicians are unlikely to go for it unless there is ample support. The outcome of this could lead to that and she is likely only trying to speak for herself. I doubt many fathers would be happy knowing their daughter could be drafted so the support for a full on draft requirement for women at least today likely wouldnt be there from any demographic.

Military,3dl9kd,Kevin_Wolf,0,Sat Jul 18 22:12:47 2015 UTC,Comparatively? Yes. We can act like there is no difference but when it comes to the honest to god truth and the emotions people feel I expect my son to serve for some reason and even though my wife serves I have reservations about my daughter doing so because it comes with a whole different suitcase of worries. Its more understandable in society today that way and thats why legislation like this would not pass regardless of what is right. Your right she is fighting against that exact viewpoint and I would be proud if my daughter volunteered to serve or if she took up this mantle but like I said im not going to lie to you my emotional reactions with her and my son are 180 degrees of different. I may be part of the last generation to feel this way but I doubt it. She is right and I would full heartedly agree if this was to be taken up the legal system but in my heart I would be worried if it ever came time to pay the piper.

One a draft hasnt happened in quite some time so out of sight out of mind. Two no one wants to take up the banner of lets get your daughter to sign up in case WW3 breaks out just so we can all be equal. That would be political suicide. A great deal of veterans would see you as a coward and the other half would see you as a war mongering nut job its a lose lose situation unless this girl can make it happen and get enough people behind her. Im not saying the way things are is right but I do think its how most people feel and thats what matters when getting legislation past because people are emotional rather than rational most of the time when it comes to family.

Concerns other than physical also exist , and its naive to suggest otherwise , but if and when a crisis should occur - assign accordingly . Please dont post images *of pencils unsharpened  *or non swivel chairs ...its becos of the horror ."

If you take some random neckbeard and some random chick, the neckbeard is going to be stronger, and could wreck the chick in a fight. Not that it matters much if you're deciding which should do some support job, but I must protest the notion that women and men are physically the same."

Fertile women safely at home won't be so safe anymore if our military gets overrun due to lack of numbers.  Can't have population regrowth if the population is gone.   We could worry about re-population after the conflict is over.

This may be the only exception to combat arms and women, but I'll keep looking :)  Edit 2: air and missile defense crew member 14S), field artillery radar operator (13R), PATRIOT fire control (14E), PATRIOTS launching station (14T), air defense officer (14A), field artillery officer (13A), air defense battle manager operator (14G), air defense early warning (14H) ...

Sorry if I wasn't clear on this point earlier.  I'm pretty sure I listed all of those MOS that are open to women in the combat branch though ...

Even in a WW3 like scenario we would still have a ton of logistical and intel work that wouldnt require people to even leave the country and if history holds true its the women that would have to pickup all that slack at home. Entering them into the draft would just allow for more possibly better qualified individuals doing necessary jobs that could be filled by anyone.

That was a Supreme Court ruling (I think in 1987.)  Now that women can serve in combat arms, the Supreme Court has to follow Equal Rights for Gender laws (Remember, SCOTUS doesn't make laws, only interprets).   There is no way this case will end with anything but women being required to sign up for the selective service."

The moral and civil implications of having all citizens be draftable is the point.  Sure, in some worst case scenario we would need 100 million Americans under arms, but the bigger question is one of citizenship.  It states in the declaration states are formed amongst humans to better secure their rights. Women are equally party to those rights, therefore, they are equally party to defend them. Being actually useful is a definition that doesnt even fit most american men any more"
Military,3dl9kd,Lionftn,6,Fri Jul 17 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"Pure civillian speculation here, but wouldn't this be somewhat pointless? In the event a draft would even be needed (which I think its fair to assume would only be in a very large scale conflict scenario) wouldn't the majority of manpower be needed in combat arms positions which wouldn't be open to women in the first place?"
Military,3dl9kd,Dnas17,40,Fri Jul 17 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Most of the military fills a combat support role, even back in the days of total warfare.  In the WWII European theater of operations, roughly 40% of US soldiers were combat troops, while 60% were admin/logistics/support.  Modern warfare relies much more heavily on support services - though technology also reduces the requirement for many types of personnel.  By Operation Iraqi Freedom, the number was almost the exact same.  However, this is misleading, because we now use more contractors than at any time in history.  Factoring in civilian contractors, the total number of ""Army Forces"" in Iraq in 2005 was 25% combat, 75% support.  (Source: The Other End of the Spear: The Tooth-to-Tail Ratio in Modern Military Operations, Combat Studies Institute, Fort Leavenworth, www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA472467)  So, in short, yes, women conscripts would absolutely be useful in the event of all out war.  Even if the tooth to tail ratio rises, putting women in combat support would free up more men to fight.  We already do something similar with the Army Individual Augmentee program (formerly called the In Lieu Of program), whereby airmen and sailors deploy as part of Army units to free up soldiers for more frontline operations.  And really, power to her.  Getting women registered for selective service would be a win for the equal rights movement."
Military,3dl9kd,Kandak_Sayaqa,10,Fri Jul 17 17:24:54 2015 UTC,"wouldn't the majority of manpower be needed in combat arms positions   Not necessarily, any kind of combat operation requires a pretty massive logistical tail. People would be needed all over.   It brings up an interesting point though, and a question that was asked (but unanswered) when I sat in on a brief by the Command Staff of the Marine Corps Integrated Task Force (our test unit). If women can volunteer for the infantry, can they be mandated to go infantry?"
Military,3dl9kd,lowspeedlowdrag,3,Fri Jul 17 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"My answer: yes.  There are certain positions that have been ""volunteer only"".  Those have been things like aviation, airborne, submarines, diver, EOD, and some others.  Everything else was a combination of talent and needs of the service.  It hasn't happened in a long time, but since male Marines can be told their orders to LAR mechanic school have been cancelled in favor of Advanced Infantry, I don't see why a female Marine couldn't be either."

I flew that little SOB twice a day every day for about 9 months.  One night my CO has my flying around observing some little village a couple clicks east of our COP. I'm sitting on the porch of our mortar shack flying around, bored as fuck because nothing is going on.  Then I start to hear a rotary wing aircraft off in the distance. I radio the TOC and ask if they set up a ROZ. They say they did. I tell them I can hear a helo in the area. They start trying to get a hold of this flight and get nothing.   I start to search using the camera on the air vehicle, and I spot an Apache approaching from the east at the same altitude. I radio the TOC and tell them what's going on and then switch to the CAG net to try and get a hold of this guy.  I get no response from the helo, so I start to climb as quickly as possible. I also begin to flash the IR spotlight at the bird in an attempt to get his attention. He doesn't notice me at all, and ends up passing underneath my Puma, probably within about 100 feet or so.  Apache  I snapped that picture and sent it to my TOC, who then forwarded it all around RC: South.  Here's my Puma with WWII invasion stripes, because why not."

Overhead Marjah/Lashkar Gah in 2010, we were priority air traffic due to supporting TIC (Troops In Contact). We knew there were UAVs flying around in the immediate area, so we put out a radio call on Guard to clear all airspace at our FL. A few minutes pass, and we hear a UAV roger up to an interrogative, and we ask them if they're in our area.   Pred- ""Affirm.""   Us- ""confirm you're supporting TIC?""  Pred- ""Negative. Loitering, awaiting tasking.""  Us- ""Pred, we have airspace priority. State BRA from position blahblahblah.""  Pred- radio silence  Us- ""Pred, we say again, state BRA.""  Pred- more radio silence  We tried him for 4 or 5 more minutes with no repsonse. We had no TCAS hits, no info from what little controller there were for the area, nothing. We figure he's either moved on or vacated completely. No sooner than we had reached that conclusion than out of nowhere swings a predator, co-altitude in a turn towards us. Our pilot pushed the nose over, I've got my face pressed against the window behind him, talking him away from the Predator. We were close enough to literally see rivets on the drone.   Our copilot is screaming over the radio, asking the predator pilot if he hears us, and if he has TCAS, why the fuck isn't it on. Pred comes back and says ""Oh...shit...my bad."", and two second later we get our TCAS hit.  We had similar issues or worse a lot in Afghanistan.

Assault rifles wouldn't have a niche, would they?  Who taught you literally anything?  Battlefield?  Call of Duty?  Fallout?

Military,3djid4,dan4daniel,11,Thu Jul 16 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"Because Roof wasn't motivated by his version of God, he didn't believe he was serving that God, and he has made no statements or been associated with any groups pointing to religion as his motivation for killing people in the Lord's house. I see the association you're trying to make but it's a flawed argument at best, one was a single act of racial hatred, the other a small part of a greater ""holy war"" by a man that was associated with a group calling itself the Islamic State. I don't believe that this man was practicing the true tenants of his faith, and I have served beside many devout Muslims who have worn our uniform with honor, but to discount the motivations of our opponents, their faith, their perversion of that faith, their methods, their devotion, their zeal, and their intentions because it is politically and socially inconvenient is folly and it will only lead to more dead not less. And those are dead in uniform and out of it."

I could be wrong but I know it's listed in those flag etiquette sites.

Military,3dnrdi,NSWMotivator,2,Sat Jul 18 05:39:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Driving a bible truck around one's hometown for seven months doesn't exactly fit the Homeric ideal.  I believe volunteering to wear the uniform and (at least theoretically) risk one's life is an admirable thing.  It is possible to both respect her decision to volunteer and still recognize that her service was not at all heroic or even hazardous.  She seems to be at peace with what she did, but most articles (intentionally?) don't mention the details of her story as though it were shameful.  I reserve the word ""hero"" for a very select few at the extremes of the bravery spectrum.  To me, applying that word to so many others disrespects the prosaic military careers of 99% of those who serve.  Some young men come back from their first deployments confused and ashamed because they spent more time waiting and taking inventories than firing weapons at bad guys like in Call of Duty.  Maybe they never fired a weapon in anger at all.  The horror!  The military doesn't need a million ""Rambos"" to function.  On the contrary, it mostly needs accountants, plumbers, computer nerds, cooks and - yes - truck drivers.  And that's okay."

Military,3dhkpf,xampl9,53,Sat Jul 18 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"On 23 November 1943, the U.S. marine landing on Tarawa Atoll emphasized the need for hydrographic reconnaissance and under water demolition of obstacles prior to any amphibious landing.  This lead to the creation of Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs)  UDTs first saw combat during operation FLINTLOCK on January 31, 1944; which became the real catalyst for the UDT training program.  In April 1944 the Demolition Teams were deployed to England to prepare for operation OVERLORD in support of the Amphibious landing at Normandy.  On 6 June 1944, in the face of great adversity, Naval Combat Demolition Units at Omaha Beach managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses and over 1600 yards on Utah Beach during the invasion of Normandy  UDT expanded into three separate teams with a strength of 300 men during the Korean War, they successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast.  On September 15, 1950 the UDT’s supported mine clearing Operation CHROMITE, the amphibious landing at Inchon. UDTs provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers and searching for mines.  Four of the UDTs acted as wave guides for the Marine landing.   On October 12, 1950 two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDT’s rescued 25 Sailors.  The next day William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an “aqualung” when he dove on the USS PLEDGE.    Responding to President Kennedy’s desire for an Unconventional Warfare capability, the Navy established SEAL Teams ONE and TWO in 1962; formed entirely with personnel from UDT’s.  On 1 May 1983, all UDTs were re-designated as SEAL Teams or Swimmer Delivery Vehicle Teams (SDVT).  SDVTs have since been re-designated to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams.  SEAL Delivery Vehicles and Special Boat Units can trace their history back to WWII.      copied and pasted from a slide show."

Military,3dioay,Liberando,24,Thu Jul 16 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"It would be expensive, and really doesn't do much to stop some one who walks through the door. Also sends the wrong message to recruits."
Military,3dioay,biocunsumer,8,Fri Jul 17 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Might not stop someone coming through the door and then shooting up a place but it would mean that they would have to travel that much further from a car into a building to commit the crime. Which would (hopefully) give someone the chance to spot the criminal and take whatever appropriate action. Not saying it would do a tremendous amount of good but maybe give someone a fighting/escaping chance.   As for sending the message to recruits, I can't argue with that. But at the same time though, you're going in to protect and serve. You're going in knowing there is a chance of deploying somewhere where you may see combat whether you are going in for a combat arms MOS or not. So for me personally if I saw bulletproof glass on my recruiting station I wouldn't be deterred. But like I said, that's just me. I'm sure others, like you mentioned might receive the wrong message from that level of progression.   And yes it would be expensive. At the same time though I think it would be a more justified expense compared to some of the other things the DOD has spent money on. But that's really more based on perception.  Either way, this incident is terrible and I hope if there is a reactive action that it is a reasonable reaction and not something stupid."
Military,3dioay,Liberando,3,Fri Jul 17 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"Valid points especially the last sentence, I think now that MP's fall under LEOSA, the DOD needs to put out official policy on the matter. And then in that scenario recruiters who happen to be MP's can carry a side arm."
Military,3dioay,biocunsumer,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:09 2015 UTC,"However there are some issues.  Bullet proof glass is really fucking pricey, and would likely be difficult to source in a sufficient quantity.  It also will not high powered rifle rounds. It will stop most handgun rounds, but it appears this shooter did not use a handgun in the attack."
Military,3dioay,StopDoxxingMe,3,Thu Jul 16 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"There are different levels of glass, and some will most definitely stop rifle rounds."
Military,3dioay,biocunsumer,3,Thu Jul 16 18:28:37 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I was referring more to the level 1/2 solutions that would typically be seen in a similiar enviornment.  The level 3 or 4 solutions that would be more in line with stopping AK rounds would be massively price inefficient to roll out at every recruiting station.
Military,3dioay,StopDoxxingMe,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"Even if they installed level 1-2 bullet proof glass, it would at least effect the ballistics. Probably not stop it but definitely slow it down enough for it to not punch through other objects/people and therefore limit the amount of damage it could cause.   Bulletproof glass is as you say pricey. And would take a while to obtain the quantity required to outfit that many buildings. At the same time though I wouldn't expect it them to roll out all that glass within the first year. Maybe 5-7yrs would be realistic. As far as sourcing, yeah the market for that is small unfortunately but then again most people/business don't need that level of protection. Banks, and some state buildings have them but up until know, most don't need it.    Personally I think it's time given current events around the U.S. and World that we harden our infrastructures. Reasonably of course, as in with some degree of intelligent thought behind the hardening. Govt/state/critical/medical facilities to be specific. Bulletproof glass on buildings that belong to the DoD, and LEO and EMP hardening on all critical, medical, DoD, LEO, emergency, and state buildings for example."

Military,3dioay,Boornidentity,11,Thu Jul 16 18:21:09 2015 UTC,Allowing people to carry doesn't mean that everyone will carry. Has that scenario you brought up ever happened before? It seems incredibly far fetched.

More like frantic trigger squeezing in the general direction. Adding more frantic armed civilians doesn't seem like a good idea. I don't know of any time this sort of thing has happened, because this sort of thing doesn't really happen in England. But how often does someone with a concealed firearm kill a mass shooter?"
Military,3dioay,notsoeasyrider,9,Thu Jul 16 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"More like frantic trigger squeezing in the general direction.   Most people in this country who own and carry fire arms know the basic principles of shooting, two of which are:    Never point your weapon at something you don't intend to destroy/kill always know what is in front of and behind your target   You don't just ""shoot where the bullets are coming from"" unlike a firefight over a mountainside with the hostiles hunkered hundreds of meters away.  Stopping an active shooter would involve taking an intentional and deliberate shot or shots and doing so only if you have a clear immediate background between you and the target.     But how often does someone with a concealed firearm kill a mass shooter?     Not often because mass murderers often pick locations where their targets are unlikely to be carrying firearms on their person, such as schools, malls, and unprotected military installations.  That being said, there have been plenty of instances of citizens stopping armed robbers because they have unexpectedly pulled a concealed weapon, documented on security cameras.    (And that's all I'm going to say on gun politics for this subject)"
Military,3dioay,brauski,4,Thu Jul 16 22:57:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, to add to this people seem to be forgetting the mass amounts of civilians who are choosing to get advanced/tactical training with their firearms every year.  These are the people that are likely to choose to engage a shooter as well. Your uncle who carries a 38 J Frame and decided to get his CHCL because all his golf buddies had one isn't going to be charging into a gunfight with an active shooter.  Or maybe he might, I don't know he might be a cool guy. My point is though that the people who are going to choose to run towards gunfire and engage are likely well trained and theres also a good chance that they're Military, LE, or a vet."
Military,3dioay,Boornidentity,2,Thu Jul 16 23:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry.  I wasn't very clear.  When I said 'us' I meant 'active duty military personnel on federal property'. Citizens can and do carry, though not in the numbers you'd imagine, and not everyone is a cowboy.  Question for you.  How well trained are the police, and how well do they do with fire control orders?  Watch some youtube videos and I think you'll be surprised.  The last few videos I've seen show a complete lack of trigger finger discipline from the officers.  Most aren't used to stress, and the spaz, understandably, when under the extreme stress.  They're no different than civilians.  Civilians also understand that they're alot more accountable for the actions than the police.  You better have tens of thousands of dollars if you decide to defend yourself with a firearm.  And I can't remember an instance of the top of my head, but I know its happened a few times.  Just google it.  Also, just in case you're trying to link your lack of firearms to a lack of mass murders, please look to China for proof that the weapon doesn't matter."

Military,3dk2e2,DrewDawgSwag,3,Thu Jul 16 22:17:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is what you are looking for but the following information can be discerned from your granfathers grave marker:  He was of the Christian faith (see cross at top ""Cath"" or ""Prot"" would have been on his dog tags)  He was a Staff Sergeant. He would have worn three stripes pointed up and a single ""rocker"" below (""rocker"" looks just like the rocker on a rocking chair)  He won THREE (!!!!) Purple Hearts! Note PH & 2 OLC (Oak Leaf Cluster). That means that he was wounded in combat during WWII THREE times and lived to tell the tail. They did not hand out PH's like candy in WWII - you had to really be wounded enough that it LOOKED like you had been actually hurt. These wounds would have left scars. Wound #1 he got the first PH. Wound #2 he got another PH but this was denoted on his uniform (on the PH ribbon) with OLC #1 and wound #3 got him the second OLC. He lived through (excuse my language) some very serious shit! He saw real combat up close and personal with the Wehrmacht and he had the Purple Hearts to prove it. It is also interesting to note that he was not (even though engaged in brutal combat) awarded any decorations for valor. A soldier, Marine, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman had to perform actions that were truely noteworthy to receive even a Bronz Star in WWII. When you read accounts of 30 or 40 decorations for outstanding acts of bravery being awarded after a battle there were hundreds of PH's awarded. The combat that your grandfather was engaged in was the most brutal that has ever transpired in human history and expectations of routine conduct can not be imagined today. I served as an Artillery FO in Vietnam and my father served as an FO in WWII. Not the same things by any measure. Your grandfather was involved in battles that lasted for DAYS (!!!) not minutes or hours. He was most probably in The Battle of the Bulge! Go here:  http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p4013coll8/id/3745  Your grandfather could have quite reasonably been the Platoon Sergeant in charge of four light (recon) tanks. The most common recon tank was the M3 Stewart named after J.E.B. Stewart (BG CSA). Go here:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Stuart  Pretty long and boring, I know, but your grandfather was the common man who was promoted significantly above his peers. He lead men into combat and suffered the truama of enemy fire. Your grandfather rode into the mouths of roaring cannon and endured and overcame. Your grandfather fell and bled for his cause and he regathered and rode again and fell twice again. Your grandfather was a comman man among men who considered themselves not heros or warriors or crusaders but common men who must at any cost accomplish a difficult task.   And he and his brothers bore the brunt. They, those band of brothers, were at the very burning tip of the spear where 4"" of hardened steel was rended with High Explosive Anti - Tank rounds that tore men and machines to bloody rags and shards. He actually rode through this landscape on multiple occasions and he not only survived he prevailed and he dominated and he lived to father children. So remember what King Henry V said to us through Shakespear in his St. Crispin's Day speech, the fire endured by your granfather turned his blood into that of nobles and it pulses in your very veins this day. Never forget the Noblesse oblige that he passed on to you. You have much to live up to and pass along. The men who walked into of that hellish maelstrom watch us all from their warrior's valhalla and their expectation is for us is to be true to their code of honor. They hated war with a hate that passes understanding but they did it and they got it over with and they returned to their plowshares and their pruning hooks. They believed that a Citizen did what a Citizen was required to do.  I know nothing more about SSG Thomas J. Keegan than what is written on that two foot square of marble but to an old paratrooper with paratrooper sons it speaks volumes to me. You should consider yourself obligated with the duties and responsibilities of true nobility granted by fire and cannon and blood."

Military,3dfy54,Vladthewarrior,17,Thu Jul 16 03:51:50 2015 UTC,It is a tank destroyer made to look like a regular tank.   The main tank gun is fake. The anti-tank missile launcher deploys to fire long range missiles at enemy armored vehicles.  I think the idea behind the ruse is to have it hidden within a tank battalion to make it less of a target. At the same time the real tanks provide protection for the tank destroyer.

Military,3dfy54,parameters,4,Thu Jul 16 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"The Spike ATGM family is one of the Israeli weapons industries most successful exports, as well as being used all throughout the Israeli armed forces. You can bet that Spike will be updated to keep pace with APS developments, especially since widespread MBT APS adoption isn't happening tomorrow. It makes sense both for national security and business reasons.  After all, ship-borne ""APS"" like Phalanx haven't made anti-ship missiles obsolete, I see no reason why the same shouldn't be true for ATGMs."
Military,3dfy54,mrtrotskygrad,3,Thu Jul 16 12:41:56 2015 UTC,you aren't hitting hypersonic speeds with ATGMs any time soon... since LOSAT was cancelled  I just think the ATGM-tank is a silly concept since if you just want a platform with TD capability it makes it sense to make it lighter and faster and put ATGMs on a wheeled system.
Military,3dfy54,parameters,2,Thu Jul 16 13:20:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know how ATGMs would be modified (attack profile, submunitions, decoys, volleys, jamming etc) I just know that Israel has every motivation to spend the money to find a way around APS.  It might be a silly idea for a country to make a dedicated ATGM-tank from scratch, but if you look at it as a way to extend the useful service life of their hundreds of M60's, it makes some financial sense.   Besides, I think the IDF value protection over mobility quite heavily, like those APC's originally made from converted captured T55, and the fact that their indigenous MBT, the Merkava, actually has the ability to carry passengers as well as crew.  This isn't surprising considering the propaganda value Hamas and Hezbollah get from every IDF casualty, Israel has every reason to make sure all its vehicles are well protected. That and any war requiring the use of their tank reserves would probably be a defensive one where the mobility issues are a minor concern.  What doesn't make sense for the US or NATO, may make sense for Israel's needs."
Military,3dfy54,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"makes sense  tanks are more artillery resistant in general, but I wouldn't be so sure with that massive missile rack on that tank.

Military,3dfzd3,boyd_a_crowder,41,Wed Jul 15 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"While this isn't likely PTSD, based on the description he might have another psychiatric disorder entirely.  And this needs an objective professional analysis, because it might have an underlying cause that could be very dangerous.  For example, while I don't think this applies in this case, psychosis shows some of the ins and outs that can only be professionally spotted.  ""Psychosis refers to an abnormal condition of the mind described as involving a ""loss of contact with reality"".  People experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder. Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities.  ""Psychosis (as a sign of a psychiatric disorder) is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded.  Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, toxins, and prescribed medications as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. In medical training, psychosis as a sign of illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent.""  TL/DR -  He may have a serious underlying medical condition that is affecting his mind.  He needs objective medical and psychiatric diagnosis.  Even a simple blood test and urinalysis might set off alarm bells."

Military,3dfzd3,freedemboner,19,Thu Jul 16 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"PTSD affects people differently with everyone from drone pilots to clerks on base being effected.  Trying to claim that only combat veterans or IED strikes qualifies is BS and that's from me a combat veteran.  I'm not sure how you can claim to diagnose your bother as faking it. You said it yourself that he has been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder.  Like others have commented he obviously has a mental condition so the name for it is less relevant.  So far you have tons of evidence that he has a real mental conditions and zero that he's faking it.  So in the end, what do you want out of this?"
Military,3dfzd3,Strood,2,Thu Jul 16 01:42:59 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI about the adjustment disorder diagnosis:  There's a lot of discussion out there that military medical is using this as a way of shifting responsibility of medical care of service members. Basically, an adjustment disorder diagnosis can be used to serve as reason to discharge someone who would otherwise need longterm care for a different diagnosis (and receive monetary benefits). The fact that he was diagnosed for it by the Army shouldn't mean much."
Military,3dfzd3,jklharris,5,Thu Jul 16 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm not in the military, nor do I have a medical license of any kind, but I do have a bit (only a bit!) of medical and psychiatric training.   I'm a combat veteran and married to a psychologist and who's seen my fair share of  psychs and had specific training in PTSD management for my team   Secondly, legitimate sufferers of conditions caused by trauma tend to avoid similar trauma.    This is simply not true. There are many many reported cases of people seeking combat situations because it's the only way they can feel alive again.   One with a trauma disorder cause by combat or other military actions would avoid firearms, other loud noises, or agressive force/threatening situations.    again you can't blanket this. PTSD is a very broad diagnosis.   Third, PTSD is an anxiety issue. People with anxiety generally don't go around spouting about how anxious they are, just like most people with genuine eating disorders don't introduce themselves with ""hi, I'm Sam and I'm anorexic."" Unless it's part of a treatment program in a controlled environment.   And again, you are generalising.   This sounds more like a loss of touch with reality, as a previous poster suggested, or other forms of delusions.   PTSD is very complex and still poorly understood. No one knows why in some situations a ""battle hardened"" veteran can crumble and the FNG is fine and also the inverse.  There is no simple, PTSD means you do this or that."

If my brother wants to smoke pot, play video games, and get mailbox money then more power to him. I am not going to entertain his claims of PTSD, so he quit talking to me about it. My brother was a combat photographer and was embedded with combat troops, but I tend to side with you that PTSD is really driven off an actual event and not just being in the presence of the enemy. I agree that it is a slap in the face to those who truly suffer from it, but there is nothing that you can say or do to get his benefits taken away. It would be next to impossible to validate or invalidate whatever story he told doctors due to HIPPA laws preventing the release of the information he told them. My brother doesn't parade around on social media claiming his PTSD 100% disability status, so I think that is where you need to take the moral high ground. What your brother is trying to do is get to full 100% disability. My brother got rated at 90% and he read an online forum that said if you act homicidal and get hospitalized for it, then you can get 100% disability.

What the OP is trying to say is that there is a distinct difference in those that have seen and suffered through things and those who can't even function at life anymore due to what they saw or did. You can say whatever the hell you want to the doctors and they are so scared for their jobs that they will diagnose you just to make you happy. They would never tell a Soldier that they are lying if they came up with a BS story or take steps to actually verify that it happened.

It's Post Traumatic STRESS Disorder, not Post Traumatic War Disorder. It can be caused by any number of things. And lemme tell you, it's not a diagnosis you can just ask for. I've been tested for it several times (because it seems like the go-to diagnosis to test for in veterans, before someone tries to tell me that I was looking for that diagnosis), and there's a lot of tests that go into making an official diagnosis. Doctors are more likely to lose their job for making a wrong diagnosis, too, so I'm not sure what's feeding your logic that they'll lose their job for not saying it's PTSD."
Military,3dfzd3,ReadingRainbowSix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:28:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can confuse civilians vs military or law enforcement. Military doctors and health care providers fall under complaint processes on both the military and civilian government employee side. This means that if a service member wants to stick it to them, that they can really let them have it. ICE complaints, inspector general, congressional complaints, installation commander's hotlines, you name it. So yeah, they do fear for their jobs. As far as the tests for the diagnosis goes, you can find all of that crap online. So if you want to start creating your answers, then you can follow any available questionnaire sheets like this one: http://www.ptsd.ne.gov/pdfs/ptsd.pdf  The truth is that if one doctor doesn't give you what you want, you can just switch doctors until you get a diagnosis. This is not as easy for civilians because the cost of co-pays and other insurance issues. Military guys have free health care on active duty and can milk the system as much as they want to. I have seen soldiers occupy appointments every day of the week for different stuff to try and get a diagnosis prior to exiting the military.

The VHA (which is the healthcare side of the VA where I used to work, as opposed to the benefits side where I work now) is essentially an elder-care system that also happens to serve younger patients, too.  Now, don't get all hissy as if I said, ""they're OLD, so fuck 'em."" Quite the opposite. We've reduced the inexcusable backlog by a LOT and we're continuing to work it. We're still short staffed (I show up to work, get fucked for ten hours, and go home just to do it again) and we serve a population of about 30 million eligibles with about half that many enrollees.  Dude.  Hatchet jobs like this article do not impress me. Goddamn near every government-run organization is a shitshow in some way, shape, or form. The VA, by and large, is and always has been an overtasked, understaffed and underfunded clusterfuck of 85-90% good people doing their damndest for our veterans to the best of our ability with what resources we have.  It makes us an easy target, so yeah. Keep punching away. Just ignore how far we've come since the sterotypical-VA days of the 70s and before that Springsteen sung about.

Instead I have to make 4 trips, wait 2 hour each time, just to be told ""Oh yea this is it"" till I go home to a phone call saying I have to come back in with a different set of paperwork.

He refused to do it over the phone because he has not seen me in 1 year. I am a 30 year old healthy male with my only diagnosis being PTSD. I am also a healthcare professional with a doctorate level degree. Despite this, he insisted on seeing me in person. I made the appointment in May and received assurance from him that I would get my Rx refills until the appointment (Zoloft).   Queue beginning of June when I do not get my refill sent to tide me over until the July appointment. PCP will not return calls, secure messages, anything. I inquire about Choice Act but I live 38 miles away (need to be 40 miles away) and even though my appointment is more than 30 days away, the PCP will not sign the form that the VA proper requires to authorize me to look for local care.  I started to self-taper my Rx so that at least I would not just stop cold turkey when I ran out. Absolutely nobody gave a fuck that I was about to run out of an anti-depressant medication that is known to have terrible terrible side effects if you just stop taking it. Patient advocate would not return my calls. I even had my wife call and beg them and they would not do anything. I called the main VA line and the lady on the other end told me to try going to ER with a fake problem and get admitted so that my PCP would come see me on rounds.   Ridiculous fuck fuck games. I finally got a hold of someone from VHA headquarters patient advocacy who got my PCP to authorize one refill so I would have medicine to last until my appointment. Even then, the PCP did not send in the Rx order for a few days and I ran out the day before the pharmacy finally called me to come pick it up (1.5 hour drive) before they closed for the day.

Military,3de1az,_Kline,6,Wed Jul 15 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"Magic formula found here: http://militarypay.defense.gov/retirement/reserve/  Retired Pay Base * Multiplier %  How do I figure out the multiplier %?  Multiplier % is 2½% times the years of creditable service.   How do I figure out the years of credible service?  The creditable years of service for a reserve retirement calculation is determined by the sum of all accumulated reserve points divided by 360.  Final formula -- Retired Pay Base * (2.5% * (Points / 360))  The retired pay base will either be final pay or High-36; I think you get a choice of which you want to calculate by. If you do 20 years you should end up with the same check as an active duty member, except for the fact that you can't start drawing it until age 60."

Exactly what I was looking for with one caveat: so as I'm reading and interpreting it, the retired pay base set essentially your last paycheck from the reserves or the high 36 is the avg monthly payment of your highest grossing 36 month period in the reserves? Thanks again!"
Military,3de1az,Paint_Me_Skeptical,2,Wed Jul 15 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"the retired pay base set essentially your last paycheck from the reserves or the high 36 is the avg monthly payment of your highest grossing 36 month period in the reserves?   Correct, that was my take-away anyhow. Also a caveat to my post, when I say ""do 20 years and you'll get the same retirement as active duty"" I mean that in terms of reserve point years, or 20 * 360 = 7200 points. Doing 20 years of only weekend drills and AT time will net you a substantially smaller check."
Military,3de1az,SCOveterandretired,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, I've always been a little lost on the ""reserve point years"".  Does that mean the years that you met the 50 point minimum(or whatever the minimum amount is) to make your year count towards retirement based on your activities within the reserves?? Because, for the Air Force Reserve anyways, it seems like they already have a little over 50 points automatically built into their standard schedule. So as long as I show up and don't fuck anything up I'd get a year that counts towards retirement? Then if I get 15(plus my 5 active duty) of those ~countable~ years I'd get apx a active duty retirement?"
Military,3de1az,dimension516,3,Wed Jul 15 21:04:32 2015 UTC,"(Fuzzy numbers ahead for example's sake, IDK what the real numbers are off the top of my head)  So you need X amount of ""good years"" where you meet the minimum amount of points to be considered ""actively participating"". Let's say you need 50 points for a ""good year"" and that if you attended every drill and AT day you'd earn 75 points in a year.  If you do only the minimum of drill and AT days, never working mandays, deployments, or other orders and had no prior active duty time for a full 20 years then you would end up with 20 ""good years"" (remember, we got 75 points/yr and only need 50) and 75 * 20 = 1500 points.  Take that 1500 points and plug it into the formula and you'll see that you need 360 points for a ""year"" of service. 1500 = 360 = 4.16 years (IDK if they give you fractional years either or just whole years, so lets say they fuck people and only count whole years for easier math).  So now your points are worth 4 years which you multiply by 2.5% per year or 4 * 0.025 = 0.1 or 10%. So in our scenario here you would receive 10% of your base pay at retirement by doing only drill and AT days each year with nothing extra. However, you have 5 AD years...So lets see how that looks as AD time is 1 point per day.  15 * 75 = 1125 points for ""showing up"" + 5 * 365 = 1825 points from AD time = grand total of 1125 + 1825 = 2950 points.  2950 / 360 = 8.19 years...So 8 * 0.025 = 0.2 or 20%. Your 5 years of AD time would double your retirement from 10% of your check to 20% of your check."

So one final question and I promise I'll stop.  That 20% or whatever it ends up being based upon my accumulated points from the reserves, that's 20% of, if I got out as an E-7/8, the pay that an active duty E-7/8 would be making right?

Not on the Memorial, nor anywhere else. Only that one place. And all you could hear was the wind, the water and the birds.  Mountain Doves and the Mynah. The same sort of sounds they would have heard on December 7th, 1941, before the attack.  That...and the sound of children playing. Because at the time, Ford Island was military housing. Families lived there. Children were playing before the attack. It would have been the last, pleasant sound many of our soldiers, sailors and marines would have heard, before they could hear no more.  Let them play. Let them be innocent of the evil that compelled us to make such monuments. Let our tongues not stumble and stammer as we try to find ways to explain the unexplainable evils of adulthood, and simply remain silent.

They wanted to protray the Nazi party and the third rich as some all powerful display of Germanic perfection. If you really delve into it, the Nazi party wasn't so much just developing ideals of nationalism and Germanic pride, it more closely resembles a religion. Kinda like north Korea when I think about it."

Military,3d9bhc,Dittybopper,8,Wed Jul 15 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"In Kansas City, MO. On Broadway there is a very nice Vietnam memorial. Several veteran friends and I formed ""Vietnam Veterans and Friends"" (VVF) an organization dedicated to having a memorial built somewhere in Kansas City. We lobbied for years, collected funds and maintained our purpose. Eventually the city donated a very fine city lot for the future home of the memorial, the mayor got behind our cause, the ball begin to roll and then the owner of a construction company announced that he would construct the memorial for a dollar. The only remaining hurdle for the VVF was to raise enough funds to create an endowment for the memorial. We did.   The memorial features a fountain (my friend Clay M, a VN Vet, designed it), beautifully flowing water which aids in shutting out the noise of the very busy Broadway boulevard traffic running along the west side of the memorial. It helps immensely in creating a peaceful place, a beautiful place. I am proud to have been a part of its creation.   On a hot summers day kids play in the fountain and adults cool their pinkies, there is a very slight danger of electrocution (underwater night lighting infrastructure) or, of course, the chance of accidental drowning. Of course too there are several signs warning against wading but not many heed the signs. When I have been at the memorial and the kids are whooping it up I do warn them of the danger and if their parents are around inform them also, I don't try and stop them or cop a crappy attitude.   http://kcparks.org/fountain/vietnam-veterans_-memorial-fountain-2/  But when the bum's begin to hang around in their tattered jungle fatigues guzzling cheap wine, smoking dope and begging for change it was another story. We original crew of the VVF got that stopped through proper channels. There may have been one or two actual VN vets in that mob, I never ran into one though."

I just feel like so many ""don't do that, it's disrespectful"" examples in society are just carry over from a past no one remembers."
Military,3d9bhc,skyraider17,40,Wed Jul 15 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"Some see tourists wading in the water akin to frolicking in a water park at what is supposed to be a solemn memorial to the many fallen from WWII. They feel that this is at or close to the same level as defacing the monument, although I'm sure the tourists don't even consider that as they seek relief from the heat."
Military,3d9bhc,WendyLRogers3,6,Wed Jul 15 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"The Pearl Harbor Memorial is extremely solemn.  It also has uniformed USN personnel all over the place, who are impressively busy managing the large crowds.  And they are available for any WWII veteran or survivor who wants to talk, as long as they want.    I cannot imagine what would happen if some fool decided to hold an attention whore ""jerk out"" there.  It would not be tolerated, that's for sure."
Military,3d9bhc,KetoEater,17,Tue Jul 14 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"Posting a sign telling people to not wade in the pool is one thing. Posting a sign telling people not to wade in the pool because it dishonors Veterans is another.  I guess I still don't see the why in your reply. I understand the people in the photo as well as many others at similar sites across the country violate the posted rules all the time. That certainly qualifies as disrespectful. What I'm getting at is the why. Why am I, as a decedent of a Veteran, expected to have a solemn attitude and conduct myself only in that manner when I visit a memorial. Death drums up a myriad of emotions in the living. Lots of crying, some laughing and everything in between. Yet when it comes to Veterans, especially dead ones, there is a sense that you better mind your p's and q's and not say or do anything that would be ill perceived. Why are we supposed to ""honor"" the dead in a very narrow way? I'm 32 years old and I still don't know what ""Honor Your Veterans"" means. Monuments like the DC War Memorial are put there as a way us who are still alive to cope with death.  Not the death of men and women who fought for our freedom, just death. It's the same reason people put up memorials on the side of the road where loved ones were killed.  My grandfather was paid by the DoD to co-pilot a B-24 in the mid 1940s over in Europe. Roughly his words. He described that period of his life as ""somethin' else!"" Thing is, he didn't characterize the remainder of his 90+ year life by what he did for a couple of years of it. Veterans are not God, nor gods. They are people. People with vastly differing opinions on politics, sex, economics, etc. If more Veterans open up about what they experienced on their deployments rather than not talking about it, more people may actually form a genuine respect for Veterans as a whole. Right now, the respect and honor coming from just about everyone I see is simply token at best.  EDIT: Clarity."
Military,3d9bhc,Tomuchan,8,Wed Jul 15 00:09:30 2015 UTC,I think it's best to think of memorials as a type of grave site where friends and family of those who passed away can come by to grieve and pay their respects at any time.

Military,3d9bhc,Finnn_the_human,12,Tue Jul 14 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"What's the point of wading in a monument? Sure, the people are overheated and want to cool off. But then that's like seeing a person sitting on someone's tombstone and saying ""they just wanted to rest their legs. It's ok."" It's not ok. You see, showing respect towards a collective group of people who died to make sure you kept your right to wade in their monument is not that hard. It's as simple as leave the monument alone, don't be rude to vets. Common decency isn't something that people should need to ask for. The reason why the vets find this sort of behavior offensive is the same reason you might find it offensive for someone to sit on your father's tombstone. Imagine if people walked up to the guards of the tomb of the unknown soldier and got in their way during the changing of the guards. Wouldn't that be at least a little bit upsetting? Disrespectful? I don't know about you, but when I am at a monument for virtually anything, I don't get on my hands and knees and kiss the ground, I don't worship the monument and those who put it there, hell, I might not even give two shits why it's there or what it stands for, but I will be respectful in the biggest way possible, by not breaking the single rule I was asked to follow."
Military,3d9bhc,KetoEater,4,Tue Jul 14 20:21:33 2015 UTC,"Well put. I'd like to think of myself as conscious of the rules in those settings and mostly follow them to the best of my knowledge and ability. That said, my thought process a lot of the time when visiting places like this is to ask myself a few ""why?"" type questions.  You state that ""Common decency isn't something that people should need to ask for."" I don't believe that decency is inherent in people, nor is it inherently common. I think the definition of common decency changes both with time and with cultural lines. A culture could deem it common decency that a woman should give a man a handjob if she sees he has an erection in public. A subset of people in that might scoff but hey, ""He had an erection, its only common decency to make sure he is relieved!""   My point is this, I don't think what we're seeing taken place is an issue of common decency or lack thereof. I think we may just live in a culture that doesn't hold the same things sacred that people who are in the ground did when they were alive. All of the ""glory"" of going of to war is gone in the USA. War, soldiers, veterans, all of it is not looked at in the same way it was in times past. Logical thinking is not going to lead one to the conclusion that these young men and women are going to a foreign to fight to keep us safe at home. Today, people have access to information that is going to bring the whole idea the military, the good ole' u s of a, and honoring vets back down to earth. We know that not everyone's motive to join the military to defend the country. We also know that not every vet thinks that their time enlisted was worth it. We know that every time the USA deploys troops into harms way, it's not because of a direct threat to the people living in the borders of the country or our allies. All of these things add up to create a culture that may not see the harm in wading in a reflecting pool while on vacation in the capitol."
Military,3d9bhc,ArmyMPSides,53,Wed Jul 15 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  After reading the other comments, I gotta wade in here (pun intended) and offer my two cents.  I was stationed at Fort Meade, MD  before and visited this site a few times.  Every time, there were large groups of World War II Veterans there, many in wheelchairs, viewing THEIR memorial dedicated to what they did many years ago that truly led to the freedoms we have today.  So yeah, seeing a bunch of people with their stinky feet wading out in that fountain right in the middle of the memorial... I could see that as coming across as disrespectful to some veterans from World War II.  I agree with the signs the Park Service put up.  If people are that hot, then they can walk 107 feet (36.2 meters) due west and put their feet into the Lincoln Memorial Reflection pool. https://goo.gl/maps/HAA0d"

If they didn't want people to wade in it, they shouldn't have built what would be, in any other context, a wading pool. If they wanted to honor those who served, maybe they should have gone with a design with more visual impact than an east German junior field hockey stadium. It's  abstracted from the subject matter by representing... something... by inexplicably having a monolith for each state and territory. Then there's a series of carvings of conscripts getting their balls juggled at MEPS and such. It think it completely fails to adequately memorialize the magnitude of the war. It looks like a little pedestrian plaza for people to rest before they walk to the Lincoln memorial after seeing the Washington monument."

It was a quiet day, there weren't a whole lot of visitors, but it was a hot and many of them were sitting with their feet dipped in the water. The 7 or 8 park rangers there did't say anything at all.  So I sat down and dipped my feet in too. And as I sat there, with the blue sky above me, my feet in the cool water, and the hot but quiet air around me and my fellow visitors I reflected on those the memorial was built for, on the freedoms they died for, and on the freedom I was enjoying.

But during the 90s he became disillusioned with that particular unit, feeling that they were being overlooked for the best missions.

He was a MSG working in S3 I think and he told a story about how the unit had a Class A inspection once a year and during his first one he noticed this short guy in another squadron with a SEAL trident.

They seem to be considred elite infantry units and regarded by the public as an elite rifle regiment. We know this isn't the case. They lack the manpower to do anything serious, if we wanted to start a war it would be SFSG and Gurkhas that thake the helm. Furthermore what do you mean start a war we can't finish? There are aprox 20,000 IS fighters, if we colaberated withe the kurds, shias, iraqi army and fsa we would be able to hand the fight over to them.   I assume you are a yank. You disregard my anger because very few of your countrymen have fallen. They have attacked brittish and french alike making a mokery of our nations strength (how often do you hear a brit deffend the french?).   That article you linked was shall we say a little biased. They despise all who are not sunni muslims. The fact that they are bombing Shia mosques and trying to destroy bagdad proves this. Bagdad is a very holy city to followers of Shia islam as that is appartently where the grandsons of mohammed were laid to rest; as is my understanding. This is how they treat their brothers. What they have done to the yazidis is bordering on genocide.   Ignore the problem all you want but rest assured if they have their way most of us here on this website would be dead. I simply hope the people of kurdistan, iraq and syria find a way to resolve it."
Military,3dci63,marinewannabee97,3,Wed Jul 15 12:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you a serious reply because you're in the Reserves (or so your ident says) and therefore deserve it. Before I do so, I just want to check you on one thing - assumptions - don't do it, moreso in any military capacity that you have. The trite reason is that ""it makes an ass out u and me"".  Firstly, let me address the brief concept of ops you put forward. You are undoubtedly right, an full UK military deployment; pulling tanks out of storage, denuding UK territorial defence and taking all fast jets over; sending complete 1 UK Armoured Div, and taking a number (6+) months to deploy; with all that I am confident we could overrun ISIS strongholds. (SFSG, Gurhkhas are light inf equiv, not what you need fighting in a desert). The basis for that assessment is the initial phases of Gulf War 2 and the US advance to Baghdad.  However once we defeated ISIS fighters who remained to fight, what would we be left with, more importantly what responsibilities would we be left with. On one hand we have the humanitarian aspect, agree with it or not, it has become part and parcel of modern conflict; disregard it and the UK would be pilloried internationally. My estimate would be that the humanitarian engagement would be huge. Essentially we would have bought a piece of the war torn Middle East, secured it and made it a safe zone. Every man and their dog in Syria not a direct crony of al-Assad would make their way their for protection. Current estimate of Syrian refugees - 9 million.  On the other hand we have the blowback. What do you think the consequences of killing 20,000 ISIS fighters would be? Not directly comparable but lets consider OP BANNER (Northern Ireland); lasted 30 years, and at any one time Mil Int estimated that there were less than 500 true players. Now at this point I'm going to guess you didn't read the article I linked to. Shame, its very well written and the author describes the situations pretty well. ISIS is looking for a fight. Firstly, because it fits their idea to bring about the apocalypse or something, secondly, and more realistically they are trying to raise the Islamic Ummah (right, at this point if you aren't scanning these links, there isn't much point in reading on). Included in the Ummah is 2.6 million UK Muslims, of those almost all are going to be lovely, reasonable people, but some won't be - remember just 500 kept us busy in NI for 30 years. History - read early Al Qaeda/bin Laden speeches and they cite the war in Bosnia in the 90s as one of the reasons the Ummah should rise up. Bear in mind that was a conflict we were - trying - to help the Muslims.  Their is a common media platitude that is thrown around these days - ""there is no military solution, only a political solution"". Unfortunately these people are almost correct. There is certainly a military component to the solution. In the long term change will only stem from the political, in the short term our security and stopping those that wish us harm will have to be military. Again however, we have to be very careful of the perception of military action. The best military action will be that you don't hear about. I'm sorry, I know that, that, will not satisfy people looking for revenge. Vicarious revenge is a pretty poor reaction anyway, though, in your case if you truly want to do something, try Selection for 21 or 23.  So in summary - a military war (that they lose) is exactly what ISIS wants. We would certainly gain a temporary military victory, but would be dragged into a decades long conflict. A conflict that would be fought in the UK. Remembering that old terrorism adage ""the terrorist only has to be lucky once, we have to be lucky every time"", that's something we should probably avoid.  If you have any follow up questions, feel free to ask, no such thing as a stupid question and all that."

Military,3dci63,marinewannabee97,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"They despise all who are not sunni muslims.    No, they despise all who do not adhere to their Salafi views. You either follow their version of Islam or you pay the price.   They despise all who are not sunni muslims. The fact that they are bombing Shia mosques and trying to destroy bagdad proves this. Bagdad is a very holy city to followers of Shia islam as that is appartently where the grandsons of mohammed were laid to rest; as is my understanding.    Baghdad is the key to Mesopotamia. You control Baghdad; you control Iraq which is why IS wants Baghdad. Baghdad is not a holy city. Najaf and Karbala (southern Iraq) are the holy sites for the Shiites.   Don't kid yourself, IS has no problems bombing Sunni Mosques and targeting/killing fellow Sunnis.    Ignore the problem all you want but rest assured if they have their way most of us here on this website would be dead.    There is more to this whole situation then you are aware of. Do you honestly think that the US, UK, and other governments are ignoring this issue and that you have the correct solution to the problem? No offense but there are thousands of individuals actively involved in trying to resolve this issue. Individuals who are more informed of the situation at hand than you and who get paid to advise their governments on how approach this issue.   All out war is not the answer. IS/ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is not a new group. They were originally known as AQI and both the US, UK, and other Coalition partners were fighting this group from 03-12. They weren't able to extinguish the group back then so what makes you think that going in guns a-blazing is going to work now? If we were to go back in then the Government of Iraq would end up relying upon us like they did back in the OIF days. Guess what would happen when we would leave? Same exact scenario.   Also, remember all those other non-AQI groups in Iraq who were trying to kill us? Do you think they just went away? If we go back in; guess what they're going to do. What about IS in Syria? We would have to invade Syria as well (terrible fucking idea) which ends up opening up a different can of worms.   Finally, how do you address the fact that the GoI has not specifically asked us to come back beyond as advisers? We can't exactly re-invade Iraq especially after we helped stand up the current government. We learned why that was a bad idea in the 1950's in various countries throughout the world.   I think you need to do some more research on this subject before bashing someone else on a topic you clearly don't clearly understand."

One of the best things about it is that anyone can be trained as a TRIM practitioner at any rank so the knowledge of what to look for gets spread throughout the services as a whole. Anyone who goes through trauma likely to result in PTSD is assessed and monitored without stigma. Incidences of mental health issues in the UK forces have significantly declined over the last decade.

Same with knocking out a $25 tent to destroy an enemy command post using a $250,000 missile. Soldiers cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to recruit, train and equip, depending on their specialty. In addition, veterans who survive come home to provide tangible benefits to the American economy. Each lost service member can cost, long term, between $500k to the low millions when they're lost. And that's not counting the $100,000 death gratuity and $400,000 life insurance policy paid to their family members.

You do realize that we aren't currently launching Tomahawks at the moment right? Early OIF (2003) we were but not at the moment. Do you realize that, like tools, certain weapons are meant for certain jobs? Bullets don't penetrate concrete bunkers and only fly so far. Precision is key especially if you want to mitigate collateral damage (<- kind of a big issue). Sending ST6 to action every target is not feasible for every mission.    Even a low tech mark V torpedo used to cost more than 1.5 million dollars.    You sure about that, slugger?    I should mention that nuke weapons are cheap for the destruction they do, but we rarely use them.   Last time I check, we haven't used them on an enemy force since 1945."

Military,3db2r3,MRoad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:00:24 2015 UTC,Right I fully agree with you. The Army would never accept a glock for example due to lack of an external safety/decocker.

Military,3d8t7c,Artfullyours,3,Wed Jul 15 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"So the EFMP limits the locations you can be stationed, in the best interest of the child's care and well-being. That being said, you should do a lot of research on what career field you wand to be, see what bases those career fields can be assigned, and locate nearby care facilities and programs that would be suitable for him/her.   What kind of support system do you have with that child? Is your spouse/partner on board to help with the day-to-day while you are at work? I ask this because i've had some dick for supervisors, and they feel that during working hours you are ""off limits"" to your children. Barring illness, you won't be able to go to their school to assist with care or drive them to an appointment, unless cleared ahead of time. Others can be very understanding, but you never know how your office will be.

I have a BS Degree so I may try to go in as an Officer.    Currently, my child attends pre-school at our local elementary school even though he is 3.  However, he was recently denied to attend a feeding clinic that he desperately needs.  My insurance is BCBS, but they're quick to deny.  We even have a diagnosis for my son that extends beyond autism since autism is not often covered.  Just for fun, I asked the feeding clinic if Tricare would cover it.  They said Tricare would cover the inpatient service.  We had him going to the outpatient service, but hey, it would be covered.  My wife is strong.  Much stronger than what I often give her credit for.  She watches our little guy every day while I work.  It's hard.  It's wearing her down.  We can't afford daycare right now.  It's too expensive, and he would need to be treated like an infant, not a toddler.  I've read that the military has CDC's (Child Development Center's) and I'm thinking that they could be a great help to her during the day.  Even if for a couple hours.

Consider that there are some men who only just fail the male standard, and some women who only just pass the female standard. These men are demonstrably better at their job then the women. So why do these women get accepted and the men rejected?   The whole argument about relative fitness is silly. War isn't a sporting event with gender segregation and weight classes. The weight of tank shell and the speed of a bullet aren't dependant on the person, they are what they are. Selecting someone who isn't the best choice for the job for the sake of being PC isn't fair to everyone who depends on that job being done."

For the services that have a higher proportion of support staff, you're creating a whole separate set of issues. For instance, the Army already spends a lot to get nurses, and the majority are women. Start making your nurses meet current (male) push-up standards, and you're now going to have to spend a lot more because you're limiting yourself to extremely fit women and men."
Military,3d5jok,22inches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:45 2015 UTC,It wouldn't make sense for the Marines either. Higher ups are making it a social justice mission to get more women in the Marines. Equality and equal PT standards would ruin that.
Military,3d5jok,Neebuz,3,Mon Jul 13 21:57:58 2015 UTC,I imagine they would start by looking at athletic leagues' regulations. Generally transgender women cannot compete with women until they have been on hormone therapy for one year. Transgender men must switch to men's athletics the day they start hormone therapy.
Military,3d5jok,skin87,-3,Mon Jul 13 22:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah but a lot of that is based upon dubious science... (As in there isn't much due to the sensitivity.)

Gender Dysphoria the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.

When you read a diagnostic manual, it is NOT a cookbook. You don't even look for a diagnostic code if someone isn't impaired or disabled. And even then, you only go search for a diagnosis if that is what is causing the impairment.  I know this is kind of confusing, but this also applies in other fields, particularly law. You can't simply read a law and know what it means without knowing all of the foundational parts. The same thing here."

Military,3d5jok,mechesh,4,Tue Jul 14 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"From an article on the DSM-V's update:  ""According to Dana Beyer, who helped the Washington Psychiatric Society make recommendations on matters of gender and sexuality, the new term implies a temporary mental state rather than an all-encompassing disorder, a change that helps remove the stigma transgender people face by being labeled 'disordered.'""  Here's another and another.  This was a big part of the change from the DSM-IV's classification of ""Gender Identity Disorder"" to the DSM-V's ""Gender Dysphoria"". GID was a permanent diagnosis - it described anyone whose gender identity did not match their sex at birth, labeling them permanently disordered. Even if they transitioned decades ago and are perfectly happy with their bodies and lives now, they were still regarded as having GID.  Gender dysphoria describes the distress caused by gender inappropriate physical and/or social conditions. The new diagnosis implies a temporary condition that can be alleviated medically, rather than a permanent mental condition. Transition is the treatment, correcting the physical and social conditions causing distress. Once these conditions are treated the distress goes away, and the person is no longer diagnosed as experiencing gender dysphoria."

Yes, there is a way a human ""should"" be. I'm not saying we can't accept people who are different... but just by looking at how our species evolved we have to at least acknowledge that they are, indeed, different. Now to be clear I'm fully supportive of the LGBT community and I'm also entirely supportive of transgendered people's rights... I just don't think military service is a good idea. For example: As you stated, Gender Dysphoria is the reason for the depression. If, for combat/ field reasons, a transgender person cannot receive the proper hormones they could start to experience intense anxiety, emotional stress, and possibly a re-emergence of the depression associated with their Gender Dysphoria (not to mention the hormonal swings and imbalance).

Here's the short definition of mental illness for you, since you don't seem to understand: ""something that causes severe impairment and disability in social, work, and family life"". That is it. Being transgender does not make someone mentally ill. While many transgender people do suffer mental illnesses, it is very likely that it is caused by discrimination and harassment. The same applies to being gay or lesbian. If the social influences are fixed, people will be mentally healthy. The toxicity exists in our culture."

Because of this, the military is usually counter to allowing people with histories of Clinical Depression from enlisting.  Additionally, those found to be suffering from it while in service are often rapidly removed from service...  There is a long list of incidents where people suffering from depression react poorly while carrying weapons, and the Services would be remiss if they did not protect all service members from that risk.  This is not to say that this will be used to bar any/all trans-people from service, but simply it will be a factor used in the consideration."
Military,3d5jok,PirateKilt,-3,Tue Jul 14 12:23:42 2015 UTC,How am I a bigot? You can't deny gender dysphoria is a mental disorder. People with mental disorders are not fit to serve.

We can argue all day and night about whether or not gender identity disorder is a disorder or not. But you can't argue that people that need prescription hormones for indefinite use, and have undergone one or more major surgeries are not fit to serve in the military.   You can't serve if you are a man with no testicles. Why would we then let trans men join?"

Also, plenty of serving members require prescription medication    Not indefinitely. Pretty much everything that requires life-long medication is going to be disqualifying. ADHD is disqualifying.    nor would they be incapable of doing their jobs if they failed to get their hormones    I don't think they'll be too happy to hear that they can only serve if they stop taking hormones.     Depression is more common In groups that face discrimination and rejection by society,     We're seeing depression rates that are orders of magnitude higher than with gays. We're starting to see that depression and anxiety disorder come hand in hand with gender dysphoria. They have jacked up brain chemistry; this is no surprise."
Military,3d5jok,Superkeys,0,Tue Jul 14 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"Okay so I'm just gonna throw this back up since it's really important and you chose to ignore it. If men without testicles can't join, how can we let transgendered men join?     I fly quarter billion dollar jets and I take prescription meds that I'll be taking for life    So what do you have? I'm especially curious since you're a pilot.    The strength of your personal prejudices won't change the fact that you will come down on the wrong side of history    I have zero prejudice against transgender people. Wanting everyone in the military to be physically qualified is not prejudice. Women have no place in front line combat. That's been proven. Am I a misogynist now?    but there are tons of countries that have allowed gay and transgendered people to serve openly for decades now    Yeah and they're all defense forces. That's important. Sure, Norway successfully integrated a co-ed military. But it's important to note that everyone stays in Norway, and are basically glorified border patrol. Same would go for transgender. I don't care what these tiny, weak, defense-minded militaries have been able to do. We can't project that onto our extremely offensive, physically demanding military.    Remember those idiotic talking heads predicting a collapse of the US military if gays could openly serve?    And their argument was something along the lines of ""if we let them in then they're going to ruin the command climate by cross dressing and fucking in the showers all the time."" That's truly laughable and it comes from the stereotype that all gays are horn dogs and can't control their insatiable sexual appetites. Same for black people. That's all baseless and quite retarded-sounding when you say it out loud.   Medically disqualifying someone for physical deformities (mutilated genitals) or mental problems (depression and anxiety disorder with history of self harm and suicide attempts) isn't remotely like the stupid arguments against gays and blacks. If you don't have testicles and you're a man, you can't serve. If you were diagnosed with ADHD, you can't serve. There's a very long list of physical and mental problems that bar people from serving. How is one as severe is gender dysphoria even getting a second look?"
Military,3d5jok,Superkeys,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to post my medical information on the internet, I was simply pointing out that your blanket statement is incorrect.    Well I expected that but you have to understand that your statement ""Well I have a long term prescription"" doesn't carry any weight if you don't disclose what it is. For all I know you take a prescription for allergies. I don't think I need to differentiate between hormone treatments and an allergy prescription.    If someone meets the required standard, then they are qualified to do the job.    Women are not qualified for front-line combat. They all failed every evaluation that took place in the last couple of years. They failed miserably.     if you'd ever served alongside Israeli forces    Oh the IDF? What does the D stand for again? Can you name me some recent offensive campaigns executed by the Israelis? Yes Israel has been extremely busy....dropping bombs and shooting missiles, defending land they already occupy. Defensive. Sit in a pill box and keep a machine gun pointed downrange. That's way different than lugging a 100-lb pack 35 miles and then getting in a fire fight. (Oh but lets open it up to people who would never physically be able to do that!!)    I served beside openly gay and transgender troops from multiple nations in Afghanistan.    Oh so you met some transgendered mechanics at the AFB you flew into? Well inside the wire? I assume we're talking about non-combat roles?    Well then some of them should be reviewed if they go ahead with this, and I'm sure they will    I don't think they determined that it was a disqualifying condition just to be ass holes. Men need testosterone, especially if physical activity is involved. Part of why our military is so great is that we don't like letting people in that have any sort of problems. There are many conditions not nearly as serious as gender dysphoria that bar people from getting in. ADHD is just one example.    Because it's treatable (as per the DSM-V), and once a member undergoes transition, they no longer have dysphoria    Well now you just outed yourself as someone who doesn't know what he's talking about. They aren't magically cured when they take the bandages off. They wont even tell you they are. They'll tell you they feel better. Which is why I'm all for surgery. Have insurance cover it. Get it done sooner rather than later so you don't get gender traits of the wrong gender. But you're drinking the koolaid if you think all of that anxiety, depression, and mental stress is magically fixed by slicing and dicing some tits and balls. Gender dysphoria is a life-long struggle.

You are essentially claiming that no female could ever be physically capable of meeting the standards to fill a combat role    It's a pretty safe bet. Safe enough to go ahead and acknowledge that it will never happen. Nobody got anywhere close at Marine IOC. Not one made it through the first day. And everyone that made it through enlisted infantry school barely made it.

Military,3d5jok,ayoungad,3,Tue Jul 14 09:42:22 2015 UTC,"If the military deems you to have developed a medical condition while on active duty you will be given a discharge.   That depends a TON on the type and severity of the condition. If the condition requires two pills a day to treat, it's likely not going to result in a discharge. I know servicemembers on military physician prescribed antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication and I have a medical condition and was allowed to commission. Most trans* people don't have any surgeries and their hormone therapy is two pills a day, not different from my colleagues' anti-fill-in-the-blank pills.   If you are transgender and decide the time you want to transition is while on active duty you are reducing unit readiness. The amount of surgeries required is prohibitive.   On what are you basing that? According to the study I linked above, utilization rate for surgical benefits are about 0.044 per thousand employees. This means that given an active duty population of 1.36 million, about 60 active duty servicemembers a year undergoing surgical transition-related treatment. We lose orders and orders of magnitude more service time due to pregnancy and maternity leave than we ever would to transition related coalescent leave but that's not a bar to women serving. Heck, we probably lose more service time due to junior enlisted doing stupid stuff with ladders than we would to transition related convalescent leave.   I'm all for them serving, but the government shouldn't pay for it and the units shouldn't suffer the lose of personnel.

Pros: Small organisation, this can also be seen as a con, but we're a pretty tight knit group, and everyone knows everyone to a certain degree.   Pretty high level of training, at least that's what we are told.   We get a pretty good deal when it comes to leave, as long as you have a balance to take, you can generally take leave.  Cons: The main one is chances of deployment, if you are wanting infantry, you have one choice, get on the Iraq trip, and if you are new, there isn't much of a chance of that. Artillery won't get sent anywhere, but Drivers and move ops get to go all over the place"

So join the airforce, you'll get paid more to do less work and you'll get promoted fast. But.. if you study first and join as an airforce/navy officer you'll get paid even more to do no work.

The NZ Army has a very good armorer's career field with excellent machining skills.  During my US Army infantry days I spent a couple years as an armorer but we couldn't do anything technical beyond swapping out parts are the operator level.  All of the advanced stuff was mostly done by civilians at the Depot level.  It seems like being an NZ Army armorer prepares you well for a career as a gunsmith or machinist."

The actual pilots are commissioned Officers or Warrant Officers. WOs were prior enlisted that are now subject matter experts in their field. The only guaranteed way to fly in the Army is by signing up for Reserve or National Guard. Everyone signs up for a specific job in those components. All commissioning sources (ROTC, OCS, USMA) for active duty have order of merit lists that you compete for slots. Rarely, you can request a branch during your schooling, but it is only for people who have extensive prior experience, and it is still a long shot. With the restructuring of Army aviation, the chances are even slimmer. As an officer, you join the military for the military service itself and try and branch to what's available. As enlisted, you have the ability to join for a specific job.   Also, as an aside, the draw down is making it tough to join up. The military is fickle, and puts a heavy weight on your fitness scores and less on a written test score.

Your meds for depression will also likely be a big no-no so the sooner you feel safe in getting off those the better.

I'm sure a good number of people are soooo tired of these posts, but I keeps seeing them get answered so I have to think that someone out there might still want to offer a bit of insight. I would appreciate any serious advice, and I'll do my best to provide any relevant information. I am female, 24 years old. I have no trouble with the law, drugs, alcohol, or anything medical. I have a couple collection accounts from a couple years back in my credit report ( both < $500) that are both paid in full, but will still show for a couple years. I test well, 97-95 on every ASVAB I've taken (high school and a couple full-length practice). I had excellent grades in high school and did well enough in college until I withdrew after 45 quarter credits. I've been working ever since, got divorced 6 months ago and decided I'm ready to follow this dream. I know the pay and benefits are nothing to sneeze at, but my main motivation for joining is that I believe in the military and I just want to help. And before you get upset, I have been to speak to recruiters. But honestly, it's hard to trust them. Random strangers on the internet have less to gain by lying to me, so I turn to reddit. I've been looking at Air Force, but I want to make sure I have all the information before I make such a big decision. Most people say to consider the field you are interested in, and go for a branch that has a strong program in that area and/or who are assigning in that field. The problem is, I don't know what I want to do. I could be happy doing a bunch of things. Right now I'm looking at Open General, because I don't really mind what I'm sent to do. Obviously I would prefer not to be a cook or a security person (as I am told is likely with General) but if that's what I get assigned I could definitely find meaning in it. I would prefer a skilled job, I would probably feel a little underutilized if I was moving boxes all the time instead of using my brain, but I know I am not the best choice for a combat role. My primary interest at this point is travel. I don't really have family, I have been married and divorced so I am not even close to considering settling down again. I really would like an opportunity to see Japan and Europe. So please help me internet! Which branch is best for travel (with the information listed)?

However, most AF jobs are normal jobs, and you get paid the same unless you fly or are spec ops, so...  I did the same thing, did college a few years, withdrew, and enlisted. Training environments suck, but operational is awesome.   I didn't want to be that close to the mission when I enlisted, and got a medical job.

Bmt is easy if you aren't stupid, can follow directions, and are remotely athletic. If you can run without stopping for 30 minutes and can do 30 push ups and 40 sit ups before you leave it'll be a cake walk.  Average day is 545 wake up. Go PT. Shower shave etc, start cleaning dorm. Go eat breakfast, sometimes do this before dorm work. Go to appointments, different base facilities or class. Sometimes drill practice. Lunch. Class, appointments or drill practice. Dinner. Shower again. Clean dorm again. Talk with MTIs in day room maybe, receive mail. May have some free time to write letters, but mostly won't, work on wall lockers to have in inspection order. Sometimes do this during the day. Especially weekends. Lights out at 2100. Do it all again tomorrow. Sometimes work EC shift at night, stand around stupidly for 2 hours doing nothing and holding a rifle. Be more tired the next day because sleep loss.  30 days of leave (vacation a year) for everyone. Can take as much as your leadership allows at once and as often. Usually not a problem. No one will pay you to fly home for vacation. Only pay for you to go to new duty station. Vacations are on your own dime. Say you take 30 days in a row, still get paid that month the same.  Want to go overseas, find a job that has lots of overseas bases. Basically a lottery. Can volunteer for short tours like Korea to improve chances of a base you want for next duty station, but also lottery based...ish.  Of course it can be a career. 20 years or more and you can retire with a pension. Is it worth it? Depends on you, your needs and desires, your family's need and desires, and how you do in the service, if your branch wants you or not. If you don't promote at certain rates, they may desperate you. Usually easy to keep promoting eventually. Some people join with plans to do 20 and leave after 4. Some only want to do 4 and do 30. Plans change. Worry about the near future first and foremost. Is enlisting the right decision right now, for me?  Benefits after vary, depends on if you are hurt while serving, how long you completed (20 for pension, one enlistment for full GI bill, etc)."

What does this mean?  How long after BMT do I ship out? What do the drug tests test and what substances are considered unacceptable? I'm considering taking some performance enhancers like creatine and similar things to get me in shape quicker. I read that you have to be 65 to receive pension.

Shipping refers to going to BMT.    What do the drug tests test and what substances are considered unacceptable? I'm considering taking some performance enhancers like creatine and similar things to get me in shape quicker.    From what I understand just illegal substances. I wouldn't bother using supplements because you have zero access to them at basic, so you'll lose most everything over the two months there.    I read that you have to be 65 to receive pension. Does this mean I couldn't enlist at 18 and receive my pension at 38?    Nope. Whenever you complete your 20+ years, you get your pension. Great way to start a second career or early retirement.

A few things are stopping me from applying and I need a little clarification on If I have too many disqualifies. I am married with two children. I have mild anxiety and I am currently prescribed a lose dose antidepressant, and low dose xanax. I don't need it to function, but it makes every day life a little easier. My doctor thinks what I actually have is ADHD which cause my anxiety. So, I am going to a psychiatrist Thursday to see if what I actually have is ADHD. If so, the doctor will take me off of antidepressants and xanax and write that off as a misdiagnosis and prescribe me something for ADHD instead. Given my circumstances, would I be disqualified? Or can I get waivers for these things? Is ADHD an acceptable thing in the military? It doesn't prohibit me from functioning, I have only been taking medicine in general for the past 2 years."
Military,3d0ucx,tacsquid,5,Sun Jul 19 04:58:02 2015 UTC,all of those conditions would require a waiver. With all those diagnoses the odds of getting in are extremely low. Even with a waiver you'd have to be off all of those meds for a year or two before you can go into DEP.

My main concerns are homesickness (due to leaving to ait right after basic and long training time) and having a girlfriend at home. I wish for the best and want to stay with her but part of me just wants us to end on a good note because I have read how hard military long distance relationships are. How do I deal with both of these problems?

I have a GF enlisted AF and while it is certainly not easy it is (in my mind) better to have the person I want to be with and be far away, than to no have them at all. As for missing family and all that, you will just get used to it. It sucks, but you will find it in yourself to handle it. Everyone goes through it."

I guess I was more worried about the gf part than anything we both really like each other but we havent been together for very long and I'd feel guilty holding her in a relationship where we are apart for long amounts of time but I also don't want to break up. I guess what she says during 'the talk' will determine what we do.

Military,3cx6ae,WendyLRogers3,38,Sat Jul 11 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"The Soviets made an interesting point that they targeted our military, and with air burst warheads, for the most part, but the US targeted their cities with ground burst warheads.  But there was an odd logic to this.    The Soviets were far more concerned about a ground invasion of the Soviet Union, which they feared from NATO, yet did not want substantial fallout on their turf.  Ironically, air burst warheads are also desirable in an aggressive advance, had they decided to invade Europe.  The US, however, wanted deterrence, so wanted the Soviets to know that if there was war, they would forfeit their motherland.  A particularly effective threat.  I should add that when the Chinese soured on the Soviet Union, their strategy was also to prevent invasion, but by using nuclear cratering charges to make the land impassable to tanks."
Military,3cx6ae,Xelif,55,Sat Jul 11 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"It's the asymmetry between nuclear first strike and nuclear second strike.  If you strike first, you want to hit military assets - mostly the enemy's nuclear capability, but also ports, airfields, C4I infrastructure, armories and marshalling grounds, key transportation junctions, that sort of thing. The concept is that you take out enough of the enemy's capability to make war that you can weather the counterstrike and gain favorable peace terms.  The second strike is where MAD (mutually assured destruction) doctrine comes in. The retaliatory strike is against the first striker's nation as a whole, designed to do maximum damage with minimum warheads, so it primarily targets cities and places of economic importance. The concept is that, by targeting thusly, you make a nuclear first strike an unpalatable option.  This map of Soviet nuclear targets in the US (click to embiggen) illustrates it nicely. The 2000 warhead strike (black circles) is a nuclear first strike. Its focus is on military targets, with large numbers of warheads targeted at the US land-based nuclear force - the huge blobs in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming/Colorado/Nebraska are essentially one warhead targeted at every known US ICBM silo. You'll notice that some large cities like Atlanta and Los Angeles aren't targeted by many warheads - it looks like Atlanta has 2 black circles on it, while the entire LA metro area has 7. The purple triangles are the 500 warhead strike, which would be a second strike, and are clustered over cities - basically, it's the answer to the question ""how do we kill the most Americans as possible with 500 warheads?"" Atlanta goes from 2 to 7 warheads; the LA metro area goes from 7 to 17 or so. Secondary cities that aren't even targeted in the 2000 warhead scenario, like Boise, Tallahassee, Lubbock, Lansing, etc. are targeted in the 500 warhead scenario."

In Georgia, for instance, you've got Fort Gordon, right next to Augusta. In a 2000 warhead first strike, you've got 3 warheads targeting Fort Gordon, clearly and specifically. In a 500 warhead second strike, you've got a single warhead specifically targeting Augusta, and leaving Fort Gordon untouched.  Ditto with Fort Stewart and Savannah, also in Georgia."

Instead ""overkill"" means that a large percentage of nuclear weapons never reach their target, so targets must be attacked by several weapons to try and assure at least one does.  Even the US missiles, which have very tight quality control, tend to fail a lot.  Just not launching at all.  Blowing up in their silo.  Not clearing their silo.  Bad immediate launch.  Blowing up when their main engines ignite.  Initially assuming a bad trajectory.  Second stage failure.  Blowing up on general principles.  Not making ballistic altitude.  Veering off course or being unable to correct course error.  Only after all of this potential failure do they even stand a chance of encountering enemy countermeasures.  After that if they miss their target enough to matter, or the warhead doesn't detonate or detonates improperly, resulting in a partial nuclear or just high explosives detonation not a nuclear one.  And this only takes individual missiles into account.  If there have already been nuclear detonations in a wide area around the launch area, space, or the target area, the overkill failure rate jumps."
Military,3cx6ae,Droidball,5,Sat Jul 11 20:23:08 2015 UTC,What does this mean about the success rate of our Cold War-era ICBMs and other nuclear weapons? How many of these do we even still depend on?

Article  Hillary Clinton stated a few years ago that there were 1,113 ready to go nukes in the U.S. stockpile. I guess the other 6,000+ are obsolete and being decommissioned or rotated into launchers when the others need service for expiring conventional explosives or tritium replacement. (Just my guess.)"

Aside from that, they clearly have a vested interest in lying about their level of nuclear capability and success, as well as at the same time in hiding their capabilities significantly.  While it is very possible and plausible that North Korea has successfully developed nuclear devices, it is just as plausible and possible - perhaps even more so - that they have not.

I agree, they probably didn't have the technical or man power means to effectively use them. But they certainly possessed them.    After the disintegration of the USSR, Ukraine found itself in possession of the world's third largest nuclear arsenal. There were 176 launchers of intercontinental ballistic missiles with some 1,240 warheads on Ukrainian territory. This force consisted of 130 SS-19s, each capable of delivering six nuclear weapons, and 46 SS-24s, each armed with ten nuclear weapons. An additional 14 SS-24 missiles were present in Ukraine, but not operationally deployed with warheads. Several dozen bombers with strategic nuclear capabilities were armed with some 600 air-launched missiles, along with gravity bombs. In addition, as many as 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons rounded out an arsenal totalling approximately 5,000 strategic and tactical weapons.

Using it to shoot down MIRV warheads is the one of the most last-ditch effort you can ever think of. I don't think it is exactly capable of doing that either.  A Iron Dome type defense for ICBMs would be things like the THAAD and SM-2, designed to intercept ICBMs in their terminal phase. (ICBMs goes from boost, mid-course (often exoatmospheric in ICBM's case) to terminal phase. Imagine the ballistic trajectory and you can visualize them.) Examples: The cancelled laser-mounted YAL-1 is for boost phase interception. The Russian A-135 system has a component of nuclear-armed exoatmospheric interceptors for mid-course interception.  You can't point any anti-air defense system towards the sky and do missile defense. The most important element not to be missed out is the targeting system.

An easy way to take out auxiliary airfields and secondary targets while your bomber seeks its main targets like Moscow or a known part of Siberia where mobile ICBMs hide.

However, the problem with being a vocal critic about something you know absolutely nothing about is dangerous. There is so much bullshit being spread about the F-35 around reddit that it is the accepted opinion now that the F-35 is a piece of shit.    I work in the industry, and it is far from perfect, but the F-35 is decades ahead of what any other nation is capable of producing. People watch ""Pentagon Wars"" and think they know what the fuck they are talking about. Don't be that guy. We make jokes at your expense on break."

It's fun to know I'll be talked about on people on the interwebs.  Let's hope that all those defense contractors keep up the good work while is stupid military folk just make it work for the job.  Having spent a year in a Bradley fighting vehicle, and three years trying to work DCGS-A it looks like another light at the end of the tunnel of good idea faries that will happily take the governments money for a weapon platform that we may not need, but as I said before. Let's hope it's not a waste of money, and that the government keeps the contract up for the sake of air superiority."

You spend day in day out with those people doing all manner of things from the mundane to the insane.  Prodding him about those people will explore the situations he experienced while in Korea. Once you know more about the people and the experiences he had in Korea ask about him and how he felt, what he did, what he regrets, what he misses...etc.  These questions are harder to answer but you'll get more meaningful answers.  My uncle can tell you stories about every man in his squad from Vietnam and will regale you with stories of their antics, what happened with them on missions, and where they are now.

Do you know medicine. 3. Do you know military medicine. They will teach you what you need to know to be a doctor when you go to the med school. I work with 2 docs who went there and am pursuing to go there myself. Also. Check out the Air Force subreddit. There is someone there now as a student. He might pm you.

Military,3cyut6,squirrelsk,2,Sun Jul 12 01:58:02 2015 UTC,I figured as much. At this point I would just like to talk to a graduate to get a better understanding. That's mainly what I was going for. I just need someone to ask stupid questions to. The advisers at USUHS just refer me to the website when what I really need is student experience.
Military,3cyut6,Baystate411,2,Sun Jul 12 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I'm a 4th year medical student and prior service, and while I don't go to USUHS I was accepted there so I'm familiar with their application process.  The first thing you need to remember is that medical school is very competitive.  So first and foremost you must do well on the MCAT and have a good GPA.  Do not sacrifice your grades for shadowing.    Secondly, you don't need military medical experience to qualify for USUHS.  They accept plenty of civilians every year who have no military experience at all so don't kill yourself trying to get it now.  The more you can do is better of course, but it's not an absolute requirement.    You can volunteer at hospitals in the area to get clinical exposure, find doctors in the community to shadow, or try and shadow at the hospital on Bragg.  So long as you get clinical exposure, you will be ok.    You mentioned you are getting your bachelors right now?  You are still active duty I am presuming?  I ask because if your degree is primarily online based you will close a lot of doors with admission committees.  Make sure you actually go to a ""brick and mortar"" school.     Last piece of advice is to not limit yourself to USUHS.  There are plenty of ways to get into military medicine if it's what you want to do.  So when application season comes around, apply broadly and apply early.  I'll say that again because it's of primo importance: apply broadly, and apply early."

A: For motor vehicle leases, “the lessor may not impose an early termination charge, but any taxes, summonses, and title and registration fees and any other obligation and liability of the lessee in accordance with the terms of the lease, including reasonable charges to the lessee for excess wear, use and mileage, that are due and unpaid at the time of termination of the lease shall be paid by the lessee”.

I don't mind if someone has an actual problem with the US and therefore does it...like someone from Iran or something, but when some spoiled dipshit  does it who has never faced any adversity, and spent their life in the comfort and safety the US accords them? Who is honeslty doing it to pretend to be edgy, to pretend as if we in the US are soooo oppressed. It does bother me because people actually have died for that. Not pretend died, actially died. Not only that, nut those that made this possible actually faced real diversity for their beliefs and chose to sacrifice their lives for what they believed a noble cause. Would i make it illegal? No, but  I would not care even a little if they got their ass kicked  Edit: here I am specifically reacting to wiping your ass with the flag and flag burning by extension.

While I say people who are unwilling to use violence are the pussies, because they refuse to stand up for their wife.  So, please tell me how you would react to people calling your wife a whore? Ask them kindly to stop? Try and be snarky back? Or would you not do anything?   I will close out this argument with this; in your op to me you said ""you will defend their right to be an asshole."" Here, you seem to be harken in back to a popular interpretation of the enlightenment ideals that our country was founded on. An honorable concept to be sure, if you ignore the fact that our own founding fathers resorted to violence occassionally to defend their honor, and I highly doubt Andrew Jackson would have let someone calling his wife a whore go without kicking his ass. In other words, I argue that we have become pussies in our society and have somehow confused violence as always bad all the time; which is untrue."

Military,3czvp6,LOWANDLAZY57,6,Sun Jul 12 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Veterans who are offended when someone doesn't fawn over their service are misguided. Citizens who lose their minds when the flag is desecrated often use such outrage in lieu of meaningful sacrifice for the betterment of the country and their fellow countrymen.   Somehow becoming unreasonably upset when a flag is defaced has taken the place of helping your elderly neighbor bring in their groceries or anonymously donating money to a local charity. The hallmark of a righteous American patriot is now indignant outrage over actions that have no effect what-so-ever on the rights, or well-being, of other Americans. The measuring stick of patriotism is now how angry one can become when another citizen exercises their rights in a manner unsuitable in the eyes of patriots.  Modern veterans, likewise, seem to forget that their service is, and ought to be, but a part of a lifetime of humble service to the greater good. We are not entitled to stand on homemade ivory towers and lord over our fellow citizens as the arbiters of when, where and how our liberties may be appropriately exercised. Serving in the wars does not mean we are better, or more American, than other citizen in this nation. We chose the path less traveled. A path that is, and should be, honored as a noble calling. But choosing such a path does not elevate us above the peace corps volunteer who spent 2 years feeding starving children in a foreign land on behalf of our nation, or the teacher who chose to bring their talent to an underperforming inner-city school.   We are all Americans. We collectively succeed or fail. We have mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. Allowing ourselves to be divided as a result of our fellow citizens exercising the very rights we have risked our lives to defend is foolish and further separates already distant factions.  Let them be brothers, let them be."

As soon as females make it into Ranger Battalions the Army is going to publicize how ""female friendly"" they are. Then the Navy is going to be pressured to have more females in NSW. Eventually BUD/S standards are going to be lowered so that they can compete with the Army. Then all other branches are going to be pressured to be like the Army or Navy and have females operating. So then everyone lowers standards so females can operate and be ""politically correct"". Then well have lesser qualified operators just to be politically correct. Fuck that. War doesn't work like that. The solution to this problem is to have no females allowed or make sure 100% no standards will be lowered. I like option #1. I use to think that if females could meet the standards they should let them, but that only works in a perfect world."

Military,3cx6n7,Lionfish_Attack,2,Mon Jul 13 02:18:13 2015 UTC,Depends on the field. I make 120k as a brand new software engineer. It's absolutely hilarious when the military thinks it's going to compete with the private sector for halfway decent programmers.  The military only gets paid enough if you think the average joe isn't capable of getting a decent job.
Military,3cx6n7,termd,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"It's not generally a ""compared to counterparts in the private sector"" argument. It usually implies that we get minimum wage, or less than minimum wage.   I definitely do want details on how you get 120k as a brand new software engineer, though. Level of education, location(or a ""san francisco/NYC vs not one of those"" if you don't want to give city), what kind of job, languages, etc. Usually the numbers I see are more in the area of 65k for new graduates."

The major caveats are ""if you're good"" and the fact that sometimes, it takes some luck to break into major companies.  Also, do keep in mind that this salary is for seattle/bay area, it'd be unrealistic to expect this in most areas. The salary should be enough to live comfortably in most places though.

And so when man and horse go down  Beneath a saber keen,  Or in a roaring charge of fierce melee  You stop a bullet clean,  And the hostiles come to get your scalp,  Just empty your canteen,  And put your pistol to your head  And go to Fiddlers’ Green. ](http://www.cavhooah.com/info/cavalry-traditions/fiddlers-green/)"

Either way, this situation sounds like it merits an IG visit if only because things like extending past an ETS, or denying terminal leave, have a VERY specific way they're supposed to be done, and odds are good a SGT and 2LT are going to manage to screw it up. Even if you deserve what's coming (sorry, I'm jaded and I've been in a while), make them do it right. It's within your rights."
Military,3cuiq4,raika11182,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:50:02 2015 UTC,"in terms of specifics how would denying terminal leave go about?  edit: Is it like denying a promotion? would I need to be counseled before hand with a task condition standards set out before me? What constitutes as a valid reason? I know the end all be all is the company commander, which would be the 2nd LT once he comes back from leave monday"
Military,3cuiq4,raika11182,3,Fri Jul 10 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't want to barracks lawyer you. I'm a SSG with 14 years in, and I've seen a lot of shit go in a lot of different directions. For what it's worth, it sounds like they're in the wrong, but honestly I've had some truly shit soldiers who probably would have needed an article 15 and denial of terminal leave. (You would be eligible to have those days paid to you in cash, by the way.) Remember that leave is an entitlement, not a privilege, but they get a lot of control in how it's administered. Remember too that finance needs lead time to make anything happen... Ever.  So here's SSG Raika11182's version of how to do this: Calmly, and professionally explain that you are concerned about the way your hands are being tied so close to your ETS. Explain that you are seeking IG investigation into the matter of your leave. Remember that recommending an Article 15 is all he can do, and defending against that will be up to you and JAG, not IG. Remember that you do not have to accept an Article 15 - you can demand trial by court martial. Remember too that since you're getting out, that might actually be a really fucking  terrible idea. Pick your battles wisely. Speak with JAG about all of your options. In fact, while you're making an appointment with IG, make an appointment with JAG so they can educate you about your rights going forward in this process. Keep your chain i formed of your every move. Take all written counselings with you, and be prepared to write a very truthful statement.  That's how I would do it. But I'm a careerist with a lot to lose. And truthfully, when I was a young Soldier I would have immediately cleared up any confusion about that ""clearing"" appointment with my NCO.   I'm of the mindset that there's nothing more dangerous than an E5 with his first Soldiers... He's scared to death of doing anything wrong, while he doesn't yet know how to get anything done. In the process, he will manage to do everything wrong. Understand that if you bring up IG, he will scoff, and pout, and maybe even get angry, but he cannot stop you. Remember, you're getting out after presumably one enlistment. You need to carefully weigh your options and make sure that your larger future is not in jeopardy either because of action on their part, or your own.  Edit - Side note: he cannot stop you from filling out your DA31. As your supervisor, he is allowed to recommend disapproval on the form - granting leave is not up to an NCO under normal circumstances."

I have every confidence 2nd LT will tow the line with what e5 says to do in regards to my situation as he has done many times before.  I will do what you suggested because it is a very level headed and appropriate response to what I am used to. The policy I've followed while being in and dealing with individuals who have never tasted power until the army was to follow their orders to well that it'll annoy them and they have to tell me to stop. It works pretty well with e5 except he forgets and asks why im doing something stupid and i have to reply that he was the one that told me to do it in the first place.  I'm writing what you wrote down and I appreciate that you took the time to write it all out SSG.

Honestly, I mean you probably heard this before, this is what happened. He took me into his office and explained that he believes i disobeyed a lawful order to clear by thursday (yesterday) because he had heard from myself, that I was going to go to housing to clear. In reality I was asking about clearing, then they asked me if I was going to ETS soon and I replied yes, I was. They then informed me I didnt have what I needed to clear housing since they were under the impression that I was going there to close for ETSing. The e5 told me my next step should have been to explain to them that I was switching barracks. In my minds eye, this ETS process is the only thing I am thinking about, even moreso since its worse than trying to run through hot tar and its been on my mind 24/7. So while I was being told what I needed to do to clear housing by ETS'ing, I should have been talking to clear to switch into a new barracks room  This is why my nco believes I lied to him about clearing. He heard I was going to housing to clear. I told him I was going to infer about clearing. Then he believes and maintains that I disobeyed a lawful order in by not having cleared by yesterday. This is where it confuses me because if I am under the impression that the housing NCO's are asking me about clearing via ETS then how can i disobey an order that I clearly didnt understand. We werent even on the same page in terms of what clearing even meant to him or I so how can I disobey an order that is confusing me?"

Quote: ""It is immediately clear that the reservist in drill status is the least expensive on a yearly basis, costing about 16% of an AC service member."" -and- ""The cost of a reservist on active duty, defined as a reservist who has been activated for one year, is about the same cost as AC at 95% of an AC service member per year.""

I'm conning the ship when the Captain comes up to the bridge and says to get closer. Roger that. We get closer within 1 NM. Then the Captain and XO start messaging the other ships how we are going to transfer the marine detachment and EOD. We are essentially going to have the other ships get in an Underway Replenishment line and instead of being at the front and have the others pick up speed to match us at parallel, we are going to start at the back and work our way up the line to help hold the wind off while conducting boat ops. So they get in a line and we get at the rear. The CO has me gun it down the line. Instead of slowing down though they have me maintain speed as I pass these other ships at 100m. That's when I see it. Water balloons. We were using water balloons and wingers that we had step up on the top level to pulverize the side of their ships. When their crew would come out to see what was going on we used our charged fire hoses and sprayed them down. Ran the line, hit all three ships, and peeled off.

Only if those two things have happened and the situation really needs sorted should you contact your downrange team.  If it's not that urgent then just let it pile up for their return or let it slip through the cracks. 90% of military shit can be safely ignored without consequence.   When emailing your downrange team try to use feel good buzz words that mean nothing instead of detailed reports.  Instead of a wall of text about this paperwork that is getting held up that you can do nothing about just say.  ""I am working the issue from my end and it will be handled in short order.""  If you get a expletive filled email telling you how shit of a job your doing do not send a detailed rebuttal.  That is a massive waste of both of your time.

Military,3cqw15,freedemboner,2,Fri Jul 10 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"A 1SG does not ""outrank you at the company level."" Sure, your CO can chose to listen entirely to your 1SG, but that 1SG does not outrank you. This isn't a pedantic argument either - a 1SG should never feel that he can get an officer fired, that's not how the Army works.   From this point on, I would interface with your CO. He  doesn't sound too competent, but that is who you work for. Not the 1SG. Same with your PSG/Rear D 1SG, he works for your, not the forward deployed 1SG, so he listens to you. If the forward 1SG can't be respectful, and especially if he's asking you to violate regulation, then cut him out of the picture.  All that said, be damn sure you're doing things correct on your end, and doing everything you can to meet your CO's intent. He may not be the most competent in he job, but he is in command. If emails aren't cutting it, and he doesn't want to do teleconferences, then ask him if there's another way to present the information that will keep him satisfied. That said, be proactive and send him daily updates (if you aren't already), don't give him a reason to be constantly reaching back to you.  PM me if you feel like you need any more help. But, you need to stand your ground. You'll catch a lot of shit for it (on here and in real life), but at the end of the day you are an officer in that company, and as such you outrank that 1SG. Don't let him bully you around or into doing something illegal because 'he has more years in.' Years in service doesn't always equal intelligence or competence."

Some guy standing watch on the quarterdeck or the guy at the gate checking IDs is more likely to be issued, and even use, the sidearm than a grunt. They aren't going to be used on people wearing body armor, who are a few hundred yards away.

When we did searches along the river with the many caves we found, I had to borrow my plt commanders M9 and use my own personal sure fire. I couldn't believe we didn't have a pool of M9s to issue out if need arose.   I've since learned a lot about TO&E and the training associated, it just surprised me. And to see gate guards with M1014s and I could only beg to carry our one M500... I think providing a deploying battalion with a small pool of additional weapons is a smart call. Like with the IAR, each company still keeps a few SAWs to use as they please, like that, but it should include a few pistols with lights, a few M1014s, a handful of M500s for non lethal etc. that way you can better task organize for a specific mission.

Military,3cmgi8,novaquasarsuper,13,Thu Jul 9 18:11:31 2015 UTC,Obviously. It isn't meant to be a primary combat weapon. That doesn't mean they shouldn't do what they can to make the weapon more useful when it is actually needed.
Military,3cmgi8,mason240,13,Thu Jul 9 03:41:36 2015 UTC,M9s are ideal as a personal weapon for tank crewman. I can't wear a rifle while tanking.
Military,3cmgi8,WhiskyBreakfast,4,Thu Jul 9 04:44:54 2015 UTC,"Didn't US tankers carry M3 SMGs as late as desert storm? They are old and somewhat crude,  but they would likely be far more effective in combat than an M9 pistol.  I heard that captured Skorpion SMGs were very well liked by US vehicle crews too."
Military,3cmgi8,mason240,4,Thu Jul 9 11:32:57 2015 UTC,"I imagine would be hard to have an SMG strapped to your body while climbing in and out of tank.  I enlisted in 2000 so I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure that US tankers have always worn pistols as personal weapons. The tank itself will also have a rifle that is assigned the to loader (in addition to his M9) and sometimes the loaders M240 machine gun will have a dismount kit (with the shoulder stock and tripod) so it can be used off the tank. Add to that the an immobilized tank degrades to a machine gun bunker, there is plenty of firepower without each crew member also needing rifle or smg."
Military,3cmgi8,WhiskyBreakfast,5,Thu Jul 9 12:00:36 2015 UTC,"Well carrying an SMG on a sling would probably awkward and cumbersome considering how cramped the inside of a tank is. But a small SMG strapped to the inside of tank could be useful as a last ditch weapon if your tank is broken down and you don't have support. Something small with a folding or collapsing stock like a B&T MP9 could be a good choice.  Although keep in mind I'm just speculating here, I don't have any actual experience other than a time I got to ride along in a Centurion tank."

While enemy combatants in Afghanistan and Iraq may not always wear body armor, I read the reason they designed the MP7 at all is because the MP5, although a wonderful submachine gun by all accounts, was becoming ineffective against modern threats. I think that was mainly around police counterterrorism.  I'm guessing since the U.S. doesn't see itself using a handgun often against an armored target in actual combat, HP seems more logical in a day to day scenario?"
Military,3cmgi8,mkmckinley,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"Handguns in general are ineffective man stoppers, they simply don't put out the kind of power that a rifle or even submachine gun would. A hollow point 9mm however, is dramatically more effective than a full metal jacket 9mm and is in fact on par with a .40 s&w or .45acp hollow point.   You are correct that the mp7 and other pdw's like the p90 are a response to the need for submachine guns that could deal with armored threats (among several other advantages) However that's a seperate discussion and those firearms are chambered in odd calibers that are entirely seperate from the debate around 9mm which is and always will be primarily a handgun round."

If you're going to honor the vets, then people are going to get all sheepish and shy.  Not all vets want to be publicly recognized as ""heros"" or listen to speeches.  So I suggest keeping it fun and food oriented.  Ask each of them to name their favorite MREs, favorite food gifts from home, and most missed / craved food item from home.    You could source out some MREs and have a tasting event for the non-vet civilians, so they get an idea of what it's like to live on that type of food.    If you want to add a service element to the day, you could adopt a unit from www.anysoldier.com, buy some items, and ask your staff to pack up some care packages for the joes currently serving overseas.

Initially we thought they were just one bite or sting each, but they excrete a pheromone that tells their fellows nearby to attack the same place, so I received who knows how many, at 106 different places.  I was dog-shit sick for the next 10 days, but I kept going, and I made it.  Spent 5 days in the field with some broken bones (not in training, though), and so on.  The fact that people quit is proof that they're not the best.  My opinion, and I mean no insult by it.  EDIT: I did not low crawl into the fire ant hill knowing it was a fire ant hill.

It wasn't but that didn't stop him.  I found who it was years later.  Why were they being investigated by CID?  Because too many guys were dying in their cycles at Benning.  I only found out because one of the guys in my cycle stayed at Benning instead of going over with the rest of us, and he found out.  When he eventually came over we ran into each other, and he laughed his ass off telling me about who it actually was (some asshole whose claim to fame was temporarily holding the world record for track standing on a bike for something like 24 hours -- the guy was a huge asshole, but respect for that).  That little rumor caused me huge trouble.  It followed me over, and I kept having these little ""accidents"" where someone told me to stand in back of a track to guard it, and then someone else dropped a free-fall ramp on me.  Got a hernia that time.  1250 pounds, something like that.  Later, a drug dealer from Philly opened my face with something one night while I was sleeping after he was busted for doing the same shit he did on the street.  They later found a pickaxe handle next to his bed.  My eyes opened, there was blood everywhere, the jagged bones of my face were sticking through the skin.  I had to have a reconstruction of my face, and naturally, the army doctor screwed it up and ablated parts of my sinuses with a cautery, so I have headaches and sinus infections all the time.  I literally blow blood out of my face every day.  Every single day.  Guess I'm still bothered by it a bit.  And there was more.  So much more.

When Francois Mitterrand came to power back in the day, he wanted to decommission the entire Foreign Legion. When he realised the Legion was the only unit he could call in to action without asking the Parliament, he suddenly changed his mind. Nothing is better than foreign canon fodder that does not create political waves if/when they die, and it is just as useful today as in 1831 for an ex-colonial power who still like to have influence. In Bosnia 1995, when France criticised other western powers for lack of initiative, the neglected to mention that 90% were Legionnaires."
Military,3ckbg0,Black6x,6,Wed Jul 8 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"When Francois Mitterrand came to power back in the day, he wanted to decommission the entire Foreign Legion.   The French left wanted to get rid the Legion because it was the only professional unit in a conscript army and because it was tied closely to colonialism. In any case it's entirely false that the Legion was the only unit that could be commanded without the Parliament approval as the President was and still is sole commander in chief and the Parliament, until very recently, had basically no say in how the armed forces could be used. On the other hand, it's said that De Gaulle wanted to dissolve the Legion when he came to power after the Algerian war because of the involvement of the 2nd REP in the Generals' putsch. The Legion was saved by his minister of armies Pierre Mesmer, a former 13e DBLE member.   In Bosnia 1995, when France criticised other western powers for lack of initiative, the neglected to mention that 90% were Legionnaires.   That's absolutely not true as can be viewed for instance in this report from the ministry of defense:  http://www.ecpad.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Dossier-thema-Bosnie-avril-2012.pdf  Also, if you look at recent deploymenst such as Operation Serval in Mali or Brigade Lafayette in Afghanistan, the Legion is not more (nor less) involved than any other branch of the French Army.  Regarding the matter of troops sent in first, it used to be based on the Force d'Action Rapide until 1999 and then on the Guepard system since then which put a different brigade on alert every 6 months (Legion units being dispersed into different brigades).  I have the utmost respect for the Legion but I just don't want people to think that the French Army is over-reliant on the Legion which diminishes the accomplishments of other branches."

The reason they are so successful is multi pronged.  One of the main reasons is that the Kurdish people have a long military history.  They have always been fighters and had extensive experience fighting Saddam and his forces.  They are also fighting on their own land for their own people, unlike the Iraqi military which is fighting for multiple ethnicities, the Kurds are fighting for their own.  They also crave their own country so they are trying to prove themselves and carve out as much territory as they can.  They also are receiving some arms, although they are limited in numbers, and they receive support from us airstrikes.  There are also US advisors in Kurdistan"

Military,3cmruf,WaterWalkers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"A huge reason why is because they're all fighting for the same cause. They wish to have a united Kurdistan and will defend their people at any cost. The Iraqi army in 2014 that had Shiite muslims fighting for Sunni Muslims and vise versa. This led to a total collapse due to ideology difference and a refusal to fight for the opposite religious faction.   That isn't the case for the Kurds. While they're not perfect, the YPG, YPJ, peshmerga and Kurish rebels all want the same thing; a united Kurdistan and will die for their beliefs. Similar to American troops."

Yea, they want their own country but they also happen to sit between 5 different countries and have different political parties/factions with different views. With the power they have, don't you think they would have done this before now? After the US pulled out in 2011, the Kurds did not made any advances to expand their territory until ISIS was able to regroup and start making the advances we've seen lately. The Kurds have only begun to push out solely for the purpose of survivability. Being defensive against oncoming strikes is not a great strategy against ISIS. Do you really, seriously think that the Kurds are going to start expanding their territory especially considering a majority of Kurdistan sit in Turkey and Iran? Guess what wouldn't work out well for them. I think you might want to reevaluate you position on them."

Commanders refused to authorize indirect fire support adjusted by maneuver officers unless they knew their exact position (cases exist where maneuver commanders knew their position to within 50 meters, but were denied needed indirect artillery fire support).18 Further, the number of forward observers and fire direction officers assigned by TO&E were not enough to support forces deployed in a counterinsurgency. Forward observers had to be located within battalions and separate companies.19 Fire direction officers had to be available to accompany separate firing batteries and separate firing platoons since the terrain could not always accommodate an entire artillery battalion--the base artillery planning unit of the Soviet Army. Since the artillery battalion was the base unit, Soviet artillerymen were not used to deploying split-FDCs--a requirement in the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. The Soviet Army never could train its maneuver officers sufficiently to solve its indirect-fire-adjustment problem, so they solved it by assigning additional forward observers and fire direction officers from the Soviet Union throughout the war.  Maneuver officers could, however, readily adjust direct, observed fire and direct fire was a common offensive mission for artillery attached to maneuver units. Armored, self-propelled artillery was preferred for direct-fire missions, but towed or unarmored artillery was also used in this role. The unarmored BM-21 multiple-rocket launcher was often used when other direct fire failed to dislodge the enemy. The truck-mounted BM-21s were usually moved into direct firing positions under the protection of an air strike and each fired their forty 122mm rockets immediately after the air strike ended. The surviving guerrillas in the impact area were normally unable or unwilling to return fire on the BM-21s as they pulled out of the firing position to reload"""

I ended up in the S-3, largely dealing with taskings. There was a young private who looked tore up from the floor up. He got shit every day about his appearance/uniform. He was also an AWOL junkie. He'd go for just long enough, and then return before they could do finance paperwork on him. They wanted him out so bad, but had failed to do any counselings, so had no history of behavior to justify the kind of UCMJ they wanted to take.  They arranged something where he was going to be out for good, and three days before that day, he goes AWOL again, and we're praying he means for good. Instead, he got picked up for grand theft auto a week later, and myself and another S-3 troop got to go handle his barracks room.  Extending the length of this...we were worried because the XO had reported a bad smell from his room. Sure enough, it does not smell fun, and I see a pet dish and think for a horrifying moment they had a pet they shouldn't have and it has died.  I finally reach up and open the night stand door and it punches me in the face, and two flies come out. These drunks had a barbeque over the weekend, and a couple of unused/uncooked steaks got returned to the night stand, instead of the fridge.  At least it wasn't a cat.  He went to prison, and that's all I heard. But if they'd done their counselings, he could have been handled a lot sooner, in a different way."

Having to get a minimum of 4-6 shirts and jackets sewn with different stripes is extremely pricey on top of normal uniform maintenance, changes, replacements, etc. Hell, just buying a squared away set of ribbons can cost you upwards of $150. That's one thing I think should be a monthly allowance that can only be spent at clothing sales. You get a little star card type thing through the unit and have a certain allowance to spend on that stuff at the BX/PX/NEX. I think a lot more people would start looking more squared away when it wasn't coming out of their own pocket."

They pulled regulations that only apply to when you're driving a GV and highlighted it, said I was going to get kicked out of school, etc.   I was worried about it, but I didn't plan on texting and driving again. Not because they freaked me out, but because I learned my lesson and decided not to be an idiot.   The E-9 called me in to his office about a week later. He sat me down and told me I'm an idiot, but I didn't break any rules. Told me I was never in any trouble and that the E-6 and E-8 shouldn't have done what they did.  I didn't like my IT1 or Senior Chief before that, but they straight up lied to me to try and get me to sweat it more. That kind of bullshit is how you foster a shitty command climate."

Military,3chvyl,HK_Urban,37,Wed Jul 8 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm gonna admit I don't know all the facts, but assuming the information in the article is true:   But officers who served with her say she was a blunt reformer who spearheaded efforts to improve recruit training regardless of gender, and that a vocal minority in the battalion undercut her achievements. Germano's tactics, for example, dramatically improved range qualification rates for female recruits.   She sounds like a commander that wanted to build her recruits into Marines.  Good Marines.  She'd know better than anyone how hard it is to build a career as a female Marine, and the kind of adversity she's faced.  Is it more likely that she's just being tough on her recruits because she can, or that maybe she's trying to do right by them and prepare them for life in the Marines for the betterment of the individual and the Corps.     Williams cited a poor command climate and the loss of trust and confidence in Germano's ability to serve in command, according to a statement that was provided to Marine Corps Times. The command investigation, completed June 25 and obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, states that Germano displayed ""toxic leadership"" by publicly berating and showing contempt for subordinates, bullying Marines and singling them out for under-performance.   As others have said, singling people out for under-performance is a staple of the military.  If you don't call out Pvt. Snuffy for being late every day or not doing PT, he's going to continue doing that.  The only thing that strikes me as odd is why she, as the Battalion Commander, would be directly singling out recruits.  Obviously there's different styles of leadership, and I can't speak for other units, but based on past experience, you'd want the Sergeant Major or the actual element leadership to single out and hem up the recruits, since the Battalion Commander would have more important things to do.  Any time my BC had an issue with me or anyone else in the unit it usually went through his Sergeant Major to my CO or NCO.     Making these Marines stand, she told them they wouldn't be able to lead their male counterparts in the fleet, witnesses said.   Again, she'd know better than any of these recruits what their male peers will and will not respect.  She's had 18 years to learn how male Marines react to a female superior giving them orders, and how physical fitness plays into the level of trust for a leader.    After deployment our Battalion changed hands and we got a new female Battalion Commander.  I didn't really know much about her, her background, her quality as a leader, etc.  Maybe she'd be better than our old BC, maybe worse, I didn't know.  One day, I was helping file the Battalion PT scores after an APFT.  I saw everyone scores, saw who was exceeding standards, and who was struggling, etc.  Everyone performed more or less as well as I'd expect.  When I came upon the Battalion Commander's scores, I almost did a double take.  Her scores were phenomenal.  100's across the board by female standards for her age group.  What was more impressive was that her scores were also well within passing for a 17-21 year old male.  She, a 40+ year old career officer, was in better shape than some of our younger guys.    At that point I had no doubt in my mind that she was the kind to lead by example.  Would I have still respected her authority if she was just barely passing?  Probably, but her performance went a long way in earning trust.  This is something I imagine would be even more prevalent in an actual combat arms unit.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this is it sounds like LtCol Germano was well aware of the impact physical fitness has on command climate and leadership trust, and wanted to make sure her recruits were ready for the challenge.  She sounded like she took steps to help her recruits perform better by holding them to tougher standards than when she assumed command, and it sounds like some people weren't happy with the reforms.    While I'm sure it's due in part to good old fashioned rank politics, in my opinion the Recruit Depot is losing a valuable leader who was effective in increasing performance in physical fitness and soldier skills within a chain of command that was understaffed and overworked.  With the important changes to the roles of women in the armed forces, a realist who ensures her subordinates can rise to the challenge is exactly the kind of leader that's needed right now.  Removing her from the equation instead of resolving the problems internally is a step in the wrong direction."

One of the ""incidents"" mentioned was in a classroom setting, where she had just shown a motivational video to the recruits, she made a few of the recruits who couldn't perform pull-ups stand and addressed them as well as the rest of the class.    I'd barely even call that ""singling out"".  Sure the individuals are known before the entire unit, but they probably already were known before (unless they do the dumb ""turn around while your peers are taking the PT test"" bullshit) and this is based on their actual performance and trying to correct it so they can be better Marines when they get to the Fleet.

Military,3chvyl,smokinglamp_throw,43,Wed Jul 8 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"Germano also ""reinforced gender bias and stereotypes"" in the minds of her Marines by telling them on several occasions that male Marines would not take orders from them and would see them as inferior if they could not meet men's physical standards, the investigation found.   The average female is not as physically capable as the average male.  That's a cold, hard scientific fact, not gender bias or a stereotype.  Like it or not, the average female marine will have to work harder than the average male marine in order to maintain the same level of physical capability.  Someone had to tell those weak hearted, stress card waving recruits (I refuse to call them marines) that nobody is going to respect a platoon leader who falls out of every road march.   The investigation found that Germano's personal viewpoints on the issue of sexual assault revealed no malice or bad intent. But, the investigating officer found, her poor choice of words and focus on accountability left room for misinterpretation and left some Marines feeling less safe.   Wtf seriously?  Leave the safe space bullshit to the colleges.  It doesn't belong in the military."
Military,3chvyl,electriophile,7,Wed Jul 8 02:35:38 2015 UTC,Is it really that outrageous to expect women to meet men's minimums?  I haven't looked at their charts recently.
Military,3chvyl,GetZePopcorn,6,Wed Jul 8 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe not for average troops who sit a desk all day, but leaders should definitely be able to do so."
Military,3chvyl,lilchubber,2,Wed Jul 8 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"Meeting our minimums usually isn't the problem. I don't have any female Marines working for me that can't keep up with us while hiking, running, or swimming. They can all do at least 3 pull-ups. The problem is asking them to meet the same standards for not only passing, but for perfect scores as well.   In our service, physical fitness plays a MASSIVE part in your ability to get promoted. The difference between a Marine with a 200 PFT and a 250 PFT is that one will likely be an E-3 for 6 months longer. We don't really give promotion points for awards. Promotions to E-6 and E-7 usually have a pretty heavy focus on PFT scores as well - board members usually consider you unqualified for promotion without at least a 245, and many MOSs are much more competitive.   That's the crux of the problem. With current standard, a female Marine with a 300 PFT will get promoted FAST, but she might not be able to keep up with her male counterparts that have a 240 when it comes to long-term training like week-long field ops. That's why the IOC essentially told female applicants that if they can't get a 275 on the male PFT, they shouldn't bother applying because they'll just get injured."
Military,3chvyl,freedemboner,19,Thu Jul 9 00:15:58 2015 UTC,I say she was doing the right thing. I am so sick of female standards being so low.  I see SO many CLEARLY obese people in the Army but it really bugs me when the females magically make tape and somehow have a 260+ PT score with their 19 minute 2 mile...

Military,3chvyl,Hunterliv,4,Wed Jul 8 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"Other than saying sexual assault is 100% preventable (wtf), she seems like she was simply trying to toughen up her Marines and prepare them for what was coming.  If anyone knows what it's like to try to be taken seriously as a female military leader, it's her."
Military,3chvyl,electriophile,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know this woman from a hole in the ground, but she could be talking about going out drinking and the sexual assaults from that. It would be far fetched to assume she literally meant even if someone breaks into your house and rapes you at gunpoint, that it could be prevented.  I would wager she meant simple things like, if you are a female.. you should go out and drink in groups of other close female peers. Dont depend on strangers to take care of you. Dont accept random drinks and the like. Most sexual assault cases where drinking is involved are preventable. Just don't be an idiot about your surroundings or people you are with."
Military,3chvyl,Hunterliv,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is most sexual assaults happen with people you know. And since female marines are pretty rare, their entire social group is likely to be male. It's not fair (and frankly insulting to both genders) to say ""hey ladies, you can't trust your guy friends. I know they're nice and all but if you drink with them there's a good chance they'll rape you, or at the very least stand idly by while someone else does!""  Most of my friends are guys because I'm in a male-dominated career field. We drink together, we go out, we make each other drinks, we have fun. I trust them completely, but if one of them were to break that trust it would be 100% on them. It's crazy to fault me for letting my guard down around people I trust, you know?"
Military,3chvyl,electriophile,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. I understand. And friends are one thing. Shouldn't be a problem in an ideal world to drink freely with your friends and they should look out for you. However, people should be conscious of their situation, meaning if you are a ""rare"" female Marine you shouldn't be black out drunk going barracks hopping trying to see where the party is by yourself.  Basically, I believe she is saying that a major measure to prevent sexual assault is to be conscious of your surroundings and don't put yourself in potentially dangerous situations. Which we all are taught anyways."
Military,3chvyl,Hunterliv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"you shouldn't be black out drunk going barracks hopping trying to see where the party is by yourself.   Again, since most assaults are by someone the victim knows, this might not be as common as people seem to think."

That year Hitler divided this country into Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and Slovak State. (We tried to defend our territory but there was no chance against Nazis) Both countries had to listen to Hitlers orders and also some men served in German army. Then in 1944 (29 August) was launched Slovak National Uprising - armed insurrection by  Slovak resistance. Germans defeated our Army but the guerrilla warfare continued until we were liberated by Soviet and Romanian Army (1945). Slovak Army uniforms looked something like this and our partisans wore ordinary civil clothing. If you want to know something more you can ask me I will try my best.

If no, you're boned and you need to go to IG immediately. You were supposed to have those three months ago.  Is your terminal leave approved and do you have an approved copy IN YOUR HANDS? If yes, good. If no, you're boned and you need to go to IG immediately. You should have had that done two weeks ago, minimum.  If you have your ETS orders and a copy of your leave form with all but the last set of signatures, have you been to a separation brief? Every installation larger than a parking lot has post-level separation briefs. Take your ETS orders and your leave form, and even if you have duty on that day, go. A fucking E5 can't stop you from going to a DA-mandated event. The time varies but most posts want you to go 14 duty days (three weeks) prior to the start of terminal leave.  If you missed all of your ACAP appointments, don't worry about that you can go to ACAP while on terminal leave and after you ETS, you should have had all of that done already but that doesn't matter now. You can go to ACAP at a different post if you are moving out of the area, and you can go to other service's versions of ""ACAP"" if you won't be near an Army base.  The VA process should be explained at your separation brief. Contrary to popular belief, your Army physicals have very little bearing on the VA process, other than providing documentation of problems not already in your medical records.  Final pay dispositions will be handled at your final out appointment. I was owed back FLPP pay, and two months after getting out I got a check for $1500.  Every post is different when it comes to clearing and things may have changed since I ETSed so I can't suggest anything past the ETS appointment but you MUST take your approved terminal leave form and ETS orders to your installation ETS briefing to start the process first.

First, accuracy. In short bursts the M240 is still a plenty accurate weapon to hit even a small rubber dingy at a distance. So you can effectively hit almost any ship with both with sufficient accuracy, this means that for any situation you'd use either of these they perform more or less the same. For a precise single shot that would be done with a sniper rifle or a person closer on the surface. Also you don't need to worry about collateral if you do get a slightly larger spread because who cares if you hit water, unlike  fighting near peoples houses and areas of infrastructure.  As far as rate of fire one can quite easily sink most small boats with just a few shots (or hit the engine) so you don't normally need a lot (firing more also costs more).  And once you've covered those it comes down to all the background logistics and politics and stuff. First, we have a lot of M240s so no reason to buy a more expensive weapon when you've got one that works perfectly fine already on hand. Next, the M240 is a smaller and lighter weapon, besides being easier to mount it just removes a lot of hassle for the guys working on the helicopter and maintenance. Also cost, I don't know about the average costs of maintenance and breakage rates of different components between these guns, but I'd imagine general maintenance of the M240 to cost a good bit less and also to be doable by almost anyone rather than needing a bit more specialized training to know all the electric components and such. Several other reasons that come to mind, but I'm guessing this covers what you where looking for, as well as some of the other things people mentioned."

Military,3cix60,weric91,0,Wed Jul 8 16:49:03 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. Same generators as the rest of the 'hawks. Limas get a spare battery to help.  The guns do get isolated onto a separate buss so the draw doesn't mess with the rest of the systems.   Source: buddy in 160th.

Plus, we are the 'bad guy' so many times (by billet) that some of us forget that it's not something you are supposed to BECOME, just a role to play.

The double stripe patch near the end is an NCO patch, and (looks like) it's from the early part of the war (1935).  The pennant (I think) is a pennant from Der Deutscher Automotive Club. Not sure though.  Image 6 looks like a War Merit Cross. I'm guessing the swords denote receiving the award for military service. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Merit_Cross  Image 7 is a General Assault Badge. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assault_Badge  Image 8 is his wound badge he received https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_Badge  Image 9 is an Infantry Assault Badge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_Assault_Badge  Image 10 is a Close Combat Clasp in Silver (for 25 battles) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_Clasp  Image 11 is a German Cross in gold.

My unit was garrisoned in a town, soaking up the sun, and mackin' pretty hard on the local females.  Well, one day, an American unit (something like battalion strength) showed up on the horizon. My unit was too few in number, so they all pulled out.  I opted to stay behind.  I grabbed a thousand rounds of ammo, my handy dandy rifle and set up shop in a bird's nest.    In case someone who isn't down with military jargon, a ""bird's nest"" is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen like myself.  Thinking we had left, the fat and lazy Americans approached the town in force.  I fired round after round in what seemed like only a few seconds.  Turns out it was closer to a few minutes.  I ended up killing sixty-eight of them.  The first day.  Then one-hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two on the third day. And on the forth, the pig-faced Americans pulled out.  Honestly, I'm not a man you say, ""Go away"" to. There's over three hundred dead bodies in Italy, that if they could, would testify to that.

My spotter and I had racked up some recent kills against Al Qaida in Iraq (group which evolved into ISIS) IED emplacers and cell commanders. We had made a name for ourselves as the Fantoms of the DRV but that's not always a good thing. AQI put a bounty on me and my spotter's head and sent their best trained sniper (a sniper instructor at their training camp, we later found out) to kill us.   It was a normal day in July. Hot as usual but nothing out of the ordinary. Out of the blue, a shot rang out and my spotter dropped like a bag of bricks. Luckily, his kevlar saved him but I knew that well placed of a shot that we were being targeted. I had a general idea where the shot came from but I didn't know the exact location of the counter-sniper. We sat there for hours, not wanting to move as to reveal our location. It was getting dark and I knew I had to take out the enemy sniper so he wouldn't get more of our guys. I instructed my spotter to place his helmet on a stick and to raise it above the berm we were hiding behind. The second he did that, a shot rang out and pierced the helmet....  That's all it took. I had seen the muzzle blast and could see the glint from the sniper scope. I took aim, adjusted for elevation, held my breath, and squeezed the trigger. My spotter and I were able to go home that night. We brought home our new souvenir: a scope Mosin Nagant with a little blood on the stock and a bullet hole through the scope.

But your telling me, that as a number 1, you instructed the more senior bloke to raise up a helmet on a stick and then after sitting there all day in the sun and not seeing any scope glint, you see a glint when it's lower light.  Then you pull of a Carlos Hathcock and get a shot down the scope, which is practically impossible, whilst only adjusting for elevation..No deflection?   Then, after all this, you didn't immediately extract, but you fucked off straight to the en Snipers position, after being sat there all day, to take his weapon system?

While we were driving, we drove up on some Hajis on the side of the road. But they weren't actually Hajis, they were British contractors dressed in Afghan garb. We saw that they had captured some HVTs.   All of a sudden, we started taking sniper fire! We all scattered but not before one of the Brits took a round in the head, dropping his Barret .50 cal sniper rifle. My black friend and I took it upon ourselves to save the day and I took the .50 and set up on a nearby hill. My black friend grabbed some binos and became my spotter, looking for targets.   We spotted the Hajis by their muzzle flashes and I returned fire and got multiple headshots (despite never having any training on that weapons system) BUT THEN MY WEAPON JAMMED!!   We were still taking fire so we dropped he mag and started spitting on the rounds to clean the blood off of them and then we shared a Capri Sun.   It was pretty intense."

Finally I was deployed in Iraq and put on overwatch.  All day long I stared through the scopes at women, children.  Day in day out, for two long years, without ever once being cleared to fire a single shot.  Then came the draw down. For me, the war was over. A quarter million rounds in my career, not one at a human target.  You ever been hungry?  Been horny? You have an itch you can't scratch?  Imagine that feeling, days, weeks, years... Imagine that feeling times...  Imagine that it's 130 degrees on the deck and tomorrow you are going home. And know that if you don't scratch that itch now, you never will.  You need a release, you need a target, and the who of it never once enters your mind.  I covered my tracks well, just like sane people do.  Almost got away with it too.... but there was a man.. he caught me... and I confessed.  So why didn't I go to prison?

What I dislike about this current trend is everyone pretends they joined because they had an unquenchable desire to serve our country. Maybe that entered into the equation, but c'mon now. I'll be honest: I couldn't get into/wasn't ready for college and I didn't want to get stuck working in the prisons or oil fields (pretty much the only options for decent money in the Central Valley). Had I gotten a full-ride to Harvard, or had parents who had money to pay my way, I probably wouldn't have joined. My best friend joined the Air Force because he ran out of money in college.

Let's face it, American is a very anti-civic duty, anti public service country and civil servants of all kinds tend to be looked down upon, except firemen and the military because of the self-sacrifice and putting themselves in danger mythos that insinuated in the cultural memories of people.   People honor veterans or firemen without actually really understanding the horrors of war and the courage to run into a fire and so often come off as shallow, especially when these are the same people who constantly vote down measures to see to the welfare of veterans.   However, if you are a teacher, you are often relegated to the lowest rung of society, cursed, unappreciated, and treated as some sort of glorified babysitter when it is arguably that the teaching profession is one of the most important job in a industrialized, civilized country. Educating the next generation is the only way we don't fall back into barbarism. And being a teacher in a rough neighborhood can be an extremely tough job.

Many young people go from being a Sgt or Captain who is good at their job and deployed to just another face in the crowd.   The transition isn't easy,  and I think a lot of those that can't achieve success in the real world fall back on their veteran status.   They use it as a crutch for their own personal shortcomings.    It pains me to see former peers get out and struggle.

People need to understand that being in the military is a temporary thing, no matter how long you're in. You need to learn how to be a civilian and realize that the military lifestyle isn't a normal way of life."
Military,3c6yle,blorgensplor,6,Sun Jul 5 21:42:49 2015 UTC,"I actually became much more confident and exercise more authority, and am more professionally competent in the civilian world than I was in my 8 years of service (not US military).   It goes both ways I guess. But I have to agree that people most long time military men might have problems adapting to civilian life but not because of the lack of authority, since most of these folks were subordinates in one way or another for the vast majority of their service.  In the military you have a mission that is your purpose as a soldier; fighters are there to achieve air supremacy, and the maintenance personnel are there to prepare the aircraft so it can fly its mission. It is very simple and you have easier time planing your work around that. In the civil world you often find yourself not knowing what you are doing and what are you doing it for, especially if you are unemployed, nobody is there to set you a goal or tell you what your mission is. Also if there is a purpose or a goal, it is often less compelling.  The other thing, a clear path through the career and life by extent. In military life your job, your authority is chosen for you, and your path, promotions and their timing are mostly set. You have to compete with other servicemen, but the system is much clearer than in civil life where there is nothing that tells you exactly where your life is going.  There are also other factors that make civilian life so much more different for former servicemen, but in my opinion these are the most significant."

An interpretation is one should keep their head low and don't stick out like a sore thumb.  Another way of looking at it, is that those who have the most, or is the most capable should be the most quiet. Capable people should possess a certain amount of reticent and quiet dignity. The master do not speak often, but when he does, you better listen and there is a respect for such attitude. But in American culture, being quiet seem to be discouraged, as though there is something wrong with it, and extrovert and being yappy seem to be the default personality everyone should aspire to."

'So, you tried to kill someone for 4 years?' is how the interview is going to go, and then it'll go downhill even further because you joined in peacetime and will say ""well, I trained to"".  There are a lot of people who seem to think that being a vet, combat or otherwise, automatically entitles you to a job in the civilian sector.  While I firmly believe that it might give you a leg up over a college grad in Basket Weaving applying for a job for the first time, this depends wildly upon what you did in the military and how you are able to sell it."

The interviewer and I had both been paratroopers, and after some aaaaarmy talk, he asked why I didn't have the army on my resume. I shrugged and said ""no one ever asked about it, or seemed to care.""  I changed the format of my resume again, and now (I guess 'then', as I have not needed a resume in years) have a single line mentioning military service, under something akin to ""Other crap of note."""

I also knew the ramifications, specifically airborne infantry training not being directly useful in the civilian world. I'm not a complete idiot.

I did the best I could for the guys outside the wire and have huge respect for them (I damn sure didn't do it for the bogus mission or the Iraqis/Afghans). It just makes no sense to bash people that happened to be placed into non combat MOSs.  We are all on the same team, and bashing your teammate for something he/she has no control over does not foster good team work.  Let's remember that Chris Kyle was not a fobbit.  Entitled behavior plagues the entire military, not just one branch or job description.  The worst nonsense is the damned ""stolen valor"" crap.

I, personally, am very thankful of all our mechanics, cooks, aid station medics, signals etc etc.. that were at the fob taking care of everybody.

Military,3c6yle,valax,33,Sun Jul 5 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"This article.  ""Israel is arguably the only modern country that retains a sufficient sense of community to mitigate the effects of combat on a mass scale. Despite decades of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have a PTSD rate as low as 1 percent. Two of the foremost reasons have to do with national military service and the proximity of the combat—the war is virtually on their doorstep. “Being in the military is something that most people have done,” I was told by Dr. Arieh Shalev, who has devoted the last 20 years to studying PTSD. “Those who come back from combat are re-integrated into a society where those experiences are very well understood. We did a study of 17-year-olds who had lost their father in the military, compared to those who had lost their fathers to accidents. The ones whose fathers died in combat did much better than those whose fathers hadn’t.”  According to Shalev, the closer the public is to the actual combat, the better the war will be understood and the less difficulty soldiers will have when they come home. The Israelis are benefiting from what could be called the shared public meaning of a war. Such public meaning—which would often occur in more communal, tribal societies—seems to help soldiers even in a fully modern society such as Israel. It is probably not generated by empty, reflexive phrases—such as “Thank you for your service”—that many Americans feel compelled to offer soldiers and vets. If anything, those comments only serve to underline the enormous chasm between military and civilian society in this country."""

My wife and I spoke with him and his wife at length, and amongst a number of interesting conversation pieces was how to address people when they blindly say ""thank you for your service."" He said that he tells people, ""Don't thank me, thank a Vietnam veteran.""  After having dealt with coming home and having a huge public movement condemning their service, a number of them went on to establish non-profits that wholeheartedly serve our servicemembers. As he told me, many of them felt that one major service they could help with was making the deployed feel welcomed back when there time was up.  Recently, I had the honor of serving in the funerals of two soldiers, both of them on the same day. At the first service, I saw a group of bikers and thought nothing of it - the man had served in Vietnam and I just assumed he was part of an MC (all of them donning Vietnam Veteran patches), even though none of them set foot inside of the funeral home yet saluted as the casket passed by. That same group was at the following funeral hours later, for a man in his early 20's, and I realized that they were the Patriot Riders. It was the most humbling experience in my short amount of time in service, and when they came up to me to thank me for my service I could not think of a single thing to say, but I wish that I had told him, ""No. Thank you for yours.""  The reason I was reminded of this is that my FB is plastered with guys of all ranks and MOSes using their service-hood to tout just how offended they are that (1) Jenner is called ""brave"", (2) gay marriage is legal, (3) the Confederate flag is getting hated on, (4) some hippies wanted to burn a flag to ""protest systemic racism"", and so on.

Military,3c8z88,AthenaQ,3,Tue Jul 7 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"That's bizarre.  When I was in grad school people probably would have looked at me oddly if I had called a professor ""Doctor"" in the classroom.  Never heard it once in that context.

Military,3c8z88,AthenaQ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"Where I went ""Professor"" was the preferred spoken title (in the classroom and out).  Even as an undergrad I was on a first name basis with the PhD candidates.  It's sounding more and more like a regional thing, but I interviewed at a few southeastern (ACC type) schools when I was applying to grad schools and ""Professor"" seemed to be the norm there, too.  Maybe my memory is going.  Can't agree that ""Professor"" is less formal or polite than ""Doctor"", though.  To me they are more or less equal."

Am I making a mistake not trying for Officer?  My GPA isn't stellar (like 3.2). It was a liberal arts type of degree. Nothing specific/technical. The school was just a state school, not ivy league. I wasn't involved in any ""leadership roles"" in college. I don't have any volunteer work to show. I am in pretty good shape though. And I think I could score decent on the ASVAB. Basically, am I a fool for going enlisted? Especially because the NG is seen as more a part time deal."
Military,3c7dm0,xsaicoticx,5,Sun Jul 5 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to do for the National Guard.  Do you want to do...a job? Be in the dirt, setting up tents, fixing radios?  Or do you want to be a manager? Track paperwork most of the time? Be a ""leader""? Get paid more, but have to do a lot more for the Army outside of the regular drill weekends?  Being an officer isn't for everyone, plenty of enlisted soldiers have degrees."

Military,3c7dm0,guitarhamster,5,Sun Jul 5 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"lol joining the national guard or reserve for ""supplemental income"" is a really bad idea. As E-4 you get like 200 bucks a a month working one weekend a month. As officer, idk how much but 300 maybe as O-1?(an officer can chime in here) but regardless it is not much at all for working like 25 hours on the weekend. You get more in a decent civilian job working overtime.  So find a good civilian job first. Might be hard if you have a useless liberal arts degree (sorry but harsh truth). If you can't find a job, might as well go active and try for OCS if you want to go active. No guarantee though, as they prefer stem degree with 3.5+ ish GPA."

Trust me, you'll just hate life as you sit around listening to powerpoints on sexual harassment and suicide prevention and waiting for the day to end. Personally I'm just doing reserve for fun. I'm a teacher full time so sometimes I just want something different.  I guess a good reason could be self improvement? But honestly, most people don't change personality much.  not much deployments going on nowadays in guard or reserve so expect boredom if you do join.  Still look into it though and ask recruiter your questions. I don't want to discourage you from joining but am just saying to not do it PURELY for extra cash."
Military,3c7dm0,CalvinHobb3s,2,Mon Jul 6 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I was hoping going in as an officer. Along with bonuses and whatnot might be nice. Also, I hear they have a student loan repayment program. And I realllly need that."

Seeing how there is such low demand for ocs candidates, you probably won't get much if you go officer but again, ask recruiter because idk about that.  But SLRP is not like you get the full amount right away. I believe they pay like 15% of your student loans per year or something like that until they use the full amount up."

Military,3c7dm0,CQME,2,Sun Jul 5 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"I think income considerations are a decent reason to join the reserves.  You're essentially paid 4 days to do 2 days worth of work...about 10-15% of your monthly income at your current rank for work over a Saturday and a Sunday.  It's not anything that you can live off of alone, but it is actually not bad given what you're putting in, all the while you will be working at a job the purpose of which you can easily identify.  IMHO most civilian jobs lack any sort of motivating purpose outside of a paycheck...this is not a problem you'll find with military employment.  Of course the benefits are going to be where it's really at, i.e. things like TA, medical/dental, retirement, etc...military benefits, especially if you live close to a large base with well-developed facilities, are quite good (to compensate for the possibility you may get shot and killed).  I would also think about what you'd be doing in the chance that you'd get called to active duty.  IMHO that should be the prime consideration insofar as exactly what you want to do as a reservist.  Given that we're ramping up in Iraq again, and how the region is playing out, I'm not at all optimistic about smooth sailing if you join now.  If you want combat experience regardless, which is a valid decision for many reasons other than quality of life, Army or Marines would probably be your best bet...but sounds like you're leaning towards commissioning, in which case you sound like a desk jockey.  Air Force would be your best bet there...the (edit: initial monetary) benefits may not be very good (because unlike the other services they don't need to throw money at you), but chance of deployment (i.e. screwing with your civilian life) is much lower and quality of life in general is much higher.  Just a warning though, if you're going to be like this guy, well...let's just say that military duty can at times be ""unexpectedly"" quite unpleasant.  I'd say ""good luck"", but in this instance, it's really all about you doing your research NOW before signing anything, so you'd be making your own luck."
Military,3c7dm0,bph517,3,Thu Jul 9 12:06:52 2015 UTC,"I am enlisted with a bachelors. so, naturally I was a bit older than the others when I came in too. I do not think you are a 'fool' for going enlisted. In fact, as enlisted in my tech school class of only 12 total people there were three of us who had bachelors degrees. There are in fact some very smart people on the enlisted side. The tough side about being older is that the people your age are the NCOs but they will not be your good friends (for obvious reasons). the good side of it is that you are mature and will already have a good work ethic so you will not have to make those adjustments like the younger ones. therefore, you should find it easier to stand out, earn awards, and rank up. there are also some really good benefits that i have been seeing. for example, less rank means less responsibilities, which means you can start working on your masters and be less stressed than the NCOs. Also, with the GI bill and TA you wont pay for any of it. I can go on all day, but there are great benefits to going enlisted. dont let an education and few extra years under your belt stop you. my advice though, once you leave for basic training dont mention anything about the college education unless someone else asks. other people I was around seemed to have brought it up out of no where and they sounded like a spoiled prick. good luck"

Military,3c7dm0,jbgator,2,Thu Jul 9 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"Is it up to the sorting hat as to if you can get put into one of these positions?   Yep   Would having airborne in my contract increase the chances of this happening?   Most likely not. Airborne isn't some super cool guy qualifier that means you can hang with the big boys, thousands of people do airborne every year. And plenty (read: most) of units give no fucks whether or not you are airborne qualified.   I don't want to end up in a cube in the Army. Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of being attached to SF?   Everyone in the army does paperwork. I'll tell you right now if your job title says ""Intelligence"" and the top point of the recruiting page says ""Screen human intelligence sources and documents"" and ""prepare intelligence reports"" I'll give you one guess at what you're going to be spending 99% of your time doing. If you want to do SF, go to SF selection (and unless you're a college-level athlete with extremely strong mental strength, don't enlist as 18x). Otherwise, there is absolutely no guarantee (and a snowball's chance in hell) that you'll be attached to an SF or any infantry unit. I was part of an infantry brigade for 3 years and I saw a HUMINT guy... once? And that was for a brigade-level training exercise. They usually don't get tasked out until deployments and things like that, and those are all going away.  That being said, it's still a great job, will get you a top secret clearance, and can set you up for a nice government job if/when you get out making nice money."
Military,3c7dm0,jbgator,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on your unit, where you are stationed, your command, and way too many other factors to give an accurate answer. You might as well think of reassignments as a giant random computer, especially for your first assignment. Anything you do outside of your MOS is a bonus. Don't base any decision what you could do, but what is guaranteed to you.  I can say most 35 series have no interest in those schools, and as a result those units might not have many slots assigned to them. That means your command would have to fight for a slot for you (and pay for it) which isn't that likely for some dude straight out of AIT."

Ask your recruiter about it.   Second way is called ""stripes for buddies"" or something. Basically of you refer someone to your recruiter who successfully enlists, you get promoted.

I can't really decide which branch though. I have no clue if the jobs in the Marine Corps are different as the jobs in the Navy with the same name. I also just can't decide which branch.  Any guidance?"
Military,3c7dm0,fromtheworld,3,Fri Jul 10 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Marine Corps officer here.  To answer youre question about intel, it depends on what intel field youre going into. The Marine Corps has SigInt, GroundInt, and HumanInt. Navy is going to have some different things from that. Another thing to point on is that becoming an intel officer is extremely difficult and competitive, out of 250 Marines at TBS about 11-12 of them will become intel officers. If you go ground intel then you get to go to IOC and have your shit pushed in for the next 3 months.  What draws you to the branches? Whatre you looking for in a military job? A career? A jump start to a job in the civilian world?"

Better benefits, I like ships, and wouldn't mind being stuck on one for 6 months. Explore the world (Or the sea for that matter)  What I'm looking for in a Millitary job is something you can't find in a civilian job. I want the honor of serving in the Millitary and serving in my country, but I also want the GI bill so I can help pay off my college or my graduate school college. I also want the job experience, that's why infantry or anything that the description is ""Kill/blow people/things up"" is a no no."
Military,3c7dm0,fromtheworld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:34:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you should go Marines based off what you wrote down, you wouldn't be happy in the Navy because it's a ""safer"" choice, and as an officer I'm not sure if your sailors would appreciate that haha.   One thing to know is that even as a Marine you still have a strong chance of ending up on a ship for 6 months at a time, and you'll more than likely see the world but you'll probably hate your life on that ship.   As an officer you're not really going to be a ""specialist"" in any certain field (unless you're a pilot/infantry etc).  Officers are more generalists, which is why no matter what MOS you have you can still pick up a good job after the Marines.  I know guys who were 0302s who got out as Captains to go work for some  big companies in California for consulting or some shit and the reason they got picked up was based off the managerial experience they had in the infantry. Honestly if you're smart with your resume when you decide to get out you can word it to make I it sound like ""responsible for managing x amount of dollars in government property, x amount of people,  etc""   What kind of benefits do you think the Navy has that the Marines don't?"

Will sites like CLEP help me out here?   Yes they do, when on a transcript from a recognized institution. So what you need to do is get your CLEP credits, and take a class with a college who will transfer in the CLEP Courses. When you bring in your college transcript it will have the required number of credits on there, they don't care how you got them, but they must be on a transcript.   MAKE sure they will credit all of the courses. Many uni's will publish an equivalency chart online.

So for me its a good thing because people who cant pass a PT test just hurt their squadron, they just take up manning slots and make more work for everybody, their crew, their supervisor, their flight/cc, DO, Sq/CC everybody.

Not right away, if anything I'd go into the reserves for two years while I get my AA then serve for four years and go back to school after. The only thing is I know the jobs are listed on the websites, but I feel like I'm completely guessing at what I'd be good at because they're all foreign jobs to me.   I would like to serve in the Marines or the Navy, depending on monetary benefits mostly. I have friends in the Navy saying that I should go Navy because I'm a girl, but I feel like they're just biased because they're already in the navy.   I've talked to recruiters from both the Navy and the Marines and have in person appointments next week. If you have any suggestions or advice please feel free to comment anything. This is a big step and I'm not nearly as prepared as I'd like to be."

I have thought of two branches. I either want to join the Army or the Air Force. If I was gonna join the Army, I wanted to either be a combat engineer, a M1 Tank Crewman, or infantry. If the Air Force, I was going to try and book Special Missions Aviation, or Security Forces. I'm just not sure where to go. My main concern with the Army is that what if I happily did my enlistment, but I decide not to reenlist. Where does that put the rest of my life? I know that in the Air Force, you get college credit for any tech school you go to, but it varies by what AFSC you are in. You Army combat vets out there, what did you do when you got out?

Think it over before you get what you ask for.  That's probably why you're getting downvoted.  I was Air Force.  Did well, stayed clean.  Bored during most of my assignments.  Took care of the military so the military took care of me.  This description will probably match most Air Force enlisted regardless of AFSC.  I served in a lot of joint units.  I was regularly approached by Army folk and asked ""why didn't I join the Air Force?""  between the chair force jokes.  From an outsider perspective looking in, army bureaucracy seemed like a tool they use to sadistically fuck people over.  I heard ""stoploss"" more times than I cared to count from Army and a lot of nonsensical deployments.  This was during Iraq though, and they were hurting for people.  If you care about quality of life, Air Force should be a no-brainer decision.  If you're looking for ""adventure"", there are a lot of ways to fulfill that need without signing an unbreakable contract that you may end up regretting if you don't get ""adrenaline"" during your time in the military, and BTW, the military is not there to cater to your ""adrenaline"" needs - rather you are there to do what the military tells you to do.  You want ""adventure"" and ""adrenaline"", go white-water rafting, or climb Mt. Everest.  You want employment and an opportunity to serve your country, join the military."

Military,3c7dm0,knightro2323,4,Mon Jul 6 23:53:59 2015 UTC,I would tell 99.9% of kids right out of high school they aren't cut out to be an officer at 17. ROTC is there to allow you to see if at 18-19-20-21 you are cut out to be an officer. You join ROTC for nothing more then a time investment and you could quit after 1 year or you could end up with a job right out of college.
Military,3c7dm0,jbgator,5,Tue Jul 7 11:12:02 2015 UTC,"What makes you say you're not cut out to be an officer? You might not be cut out now, but in ~5 years when you're graduating college, with years of grooming and development with ROTC as well as just maturing, who knows?  I can say this, most of the officers I know now say at one point ""I'm not cut out for this."""
Military,3c7dm0,xsaicoticx,7,Mon Jul 6 05:40:10 2015 UTC,And most of them wind up not being cut out for it well in to retirement.
Military,3c7dm0,MoistBacon,2,Sun Jul 5 22:11:07 2015 UTC,It is possible but it is all left to chance of getting into a unit/job where this is a doable thing. I knew some guys that tried to do this and it was very hard and most of them didn't get much accomplished. We had almost a year long period working up to a deployment where we were going out to the field about twice a month for multiple days and those guys couldn't do shit since they didn't have internet access and our command didn't give two shits about them taking classes online. They even tried to put in for leave for a few days when we werent in the field so they could finish their classes and their leave got denied. Don't bank on the idea that you could finish school in 4 years or that the military will work with you in anyway to make it happen.   Officer training is harder than enlisted but they live the fucking life compared to enlisted who get treated like shit in comparison. If you are cut out to be in the military you should think you are cut out to be an officer. Like u/jbgator said ROTC will take care of you if you go down that route.
Military,3c7dm0,xsaicoticx,4,Mon Jul 6 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"First off: ROTC generally leads to people being officers. So if you're not ""cut out to be an officer"", no, ROTC is probably not the best route.   Plenty of enlisted people do college while enlisted. If you go Active Duty, it will be heavily dependent on your job and unit, which is impossible to predict now what your schedule will be like. Night classes or online are possible-- just do not get even the slightest idea of trying to do classes during the day. Ain't happening.  Alternatively, you could do a regular 4-year program and enlist in the Guard/Reserves. Just be a full-time student making some extra money on the weekend wearing a (your branch here) costume.   You should probably narrow down if you want to be Active or part-time first."

Military,3c7dm0,xsaicoticx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:13:20 2015 UTC,4 year college program. Since that's what is being discussed.
Military,3c7dm0,guitarhamster,0,Mon Jul 6 06:51:45 2015 UTC,"This is THE best route imo for college + military concurrent: 1. Enlist NOW into national guard (has more money than reserve usually). Before college or maybe next spring after 1 semester, go do basic and AIT. Depending on your MOS, you can go back home and to school after 6 months to like 1.5 years. 2. Go to college. Use Montgomery GI Bill +  FEDERAL Tuition Assistance + STATE Tuition Assistance concurrently (My state texas can do this. idk about other states but you at least get one, the other, or all). If you go to a state university, you should have most if not all of tuition covered by tuition assistance and part of your housing covered by GI Bill. Furthermore, you might be eligible for FAFSA fin aid, grants, or just do part time work at your school and you're pretty much all set. 3. Keep going to college and drill once a month. If you DO want to become an officer, you sign a ROTC contract end of sophomore year. You do ROTC junior and senior year. You commission after 4 years. You COULD do first 2 years of ROTC but you don't have to if you went through basic as enlisted.  Alternatively if you DO NOT want be an officer, just finish your national guard contract out and pursue civilian career in meantime."

Military,3c7dm0,mauripj,0,Tue Jul 7 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"I have always respected the military and those who serve. Both my grandfathers fought in World War II, one of my uncle's served in Vietnam, and another uncle served in Afghanistan.  My one grandfather flew in the 8th Air Force as part of the 369th Bombardment Squadron over Europe. He was shot down on his last mission days before Christmas, and was kept in a German war hospital for three months after they amputated his leg. He was only 23.  I have admired these men for their service and what they've gone through.  Let me start by saying I am someone who has always challenged himself to get better every day. Every day I strive to push myself beyond my comfort level and grow. I am someone who is very disciplined when it comes to his goals, and makes a very concerted effort to achieve those.  I am currently in law school and a couple years ago I was a signature away from joining the Army Reserve. I had scored in the highest percentile on my ASVAB and my recruiter was over the moon that I walked into his office. Other things came up though and I got sidetracked. I opened a business, and eventually sold the business and moved to California for law school.  Now law school was a challenge when I first got here, but after figuring out the game and how to succeed, I lost drive. Law school was no longer a challenge. So again I look at something that would be a challenge for me. So I have looked into joining JAG after law school, but I have also just looked at the possibility of joining the Air Force Reserve not as a JAG. In the past couple weeks I have less focused on getting into JAG and more on preparing myself for a challenge.  Civilian life gets boring for me. I want to do and see things not a lot of people get to see. I want to learn skills not many people have. I want to look back on my life and say I served my country I love so much. The biggest benefit I see out of joining is not the benefits like health care, housing, retirement; but instead the personal growth and pride that would come with serving.  So I am posting this because it's half rant, half reaching out to get personal feedback. Do my goals align with what I would get out joining the military? Even if I don't get into JAG, what are some other options to pursue when it comes to joining a reserve component? Anything I should be looking out for during this whole process? Thank you for any feedback."
Military,3c7dm0,tacsquid,3,Wed Jul 8 00:29:56 2015 UTC,learn to use paragraphs. Getting into JAG is extremely competitive and if you just walked out of DEP previously you probably won't have a chance. If you want a challenge just go run an ironman or something.

Military,3c8v7l,fromtheworld,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:56:46 2015 UTC,Hasn't the army actually done more amphib assaults then them? Because of all the Pacific island assaults?
Military,3c8v7l,drbaconboy,2,Tue Jul 7 01:55:11 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the Marine Corps did the amphib assaults in the Pacific.
Military,3c8v7l,fromtheworld,3,Tue Jul 7 02:33:38 2015 UTC,http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/AmphibiousAssaults.aspx That's Marine Corps propaganda. A bunch of different Army units took part in amphib assaults.
Military,3c8v7l,mjuntunen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"1) Nobody is saying the army wasnt involved in the pacific or played some roles in the amphib assaults, but when an assault was launched the vast majority of it was carried out by Marines. Even the source you provided mentions most of the combat done was by Marines (with exception for Okinawa.)  2) Your source is missing battles like quadalcanal, tulagi, etc."
Military,3c8v7l,drbaconboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"The Army does not eat, sleep, live, breath amphibious assaults.  The Marine corps does.  While the Army has the textbooks and doctrine down to implement such an assault, the army does not practice it on a regular enough basis to put together such an operation within 6 months.  The Marine Corps can do so as soon as the ships with the troops arrive on location."

It's so embarrasing as a veteran to see how military members are paraded around before shows, BECAUSE THE SPORTS LEAGUE WAS PAID TO, and then everyone else thinks it's somehow patriotic.  giant scam that comes off as very, very tacky."
Military,3c04st,sheepcat87,22,Fri Jul 3 17:03:31 2015 UTC,I felt the same way. Then you gotta remember the military is just advertising itself. When the teams give free tickets to vets and what not they get compt by Uncle Sam. Don't get me wrong I feel disgusted to be betrayed with this knowledge. But it's really not as evil as we make it out to be. Advertising is advertising
Military,3c04st,lt_hindu,17,Fri Jul 3 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain teams or any other business don't get ""compt by Uncle Sam"" for giving veterans a discount.  It's a business practice any business can choose to employ.  It was very popular following 9/11 for obvious reasons.  Nothing to do with government collusion."
Military,3c04st,CQME,16,Fri Jul 3 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Right.  By and large, business give veteran's discounts for two reasons: (1) in places where there is a large military presence, to compete for customers, and (2) more importantly, because other paying customers like it, and fostering goodwill with your customers is good business.  It's not altruism.  The worst example I've seen of this is at the food court in Long Beach Airport in LA.  They have a ton of big, red-white-and-blue banners advertising that military members get complimentary meals, under the headline: ""Treat Our Troops: You've Served Our Country, Now Let Us Serve You.""    But they're not giving out any free meals.  Instead, they ask other customers to pay an extra $5 towards a service member's meal, and they keep track of how many donations were made that day.  Once the donations run out, then the free meals end too.  The airport (actually, whoever is the food service contractor) isn't paying anything, but is trying to get all the credit.  It's breathtakingly brazen."
Military,3c04st,carbolicsmoke,15,Fri Jul 3 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why anyone is downvoting the above comment.  At one of the places I was stationed, a local Chipotle decided to give veterans free burritos on their grand opening - not just free drinks like the rest of Chipotle but free meals too.  The reasoning was obvious...1) they opened that restaurant in 2005, right smack in the middle of the Iraq War, and 2) the town in which it opened was almost completely reliant upon the local military base for its economic survival.    It simply made good business sense.  Was this one Chipotle restaurant ""compt by Uncle Sam"" for making a sound business decision?  Absolutely ridiculous."

Military,3c04st,mscomies,224,Fri Jul 3 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"So, in 2008, I had the worst experience of my life.  It didn't happen in Afghanistan.  It was May, and we had been back for a few weeks.  It was time for the Coca Cola 600.  They needed volunteers.  I was voluntold, and given very vague details, just ""be sure to have your uniform with you.""  Okay, fine.  It's on a Sunday.  Fucking Christ, the Army is taking my goddamn weekend from me.  This does not bode well.  And we had to leave at like 0530.  Fucking bullshit.  We get there, and we have some time before they feed us (hotdogs and potato chips, they went for broke for us!).  Some friendly guys offer us beer.  Okay, maybe this won't be so bad.  Free beer and it's not even noon?  Fuck yeah.  Lunch was hotdogs and potato chips.  Whee.  Then, we are told to get into uniform and form up.  That's never good, ever.  So, we form up, and somehow this takes like 45 minutes to get us properly organized.  It makes no sense to me either.  Then we get moved to the track.  Then we wait.  In the sun.  And it's like 90+ degrees.  For who the fuck knows how long.  Then they form us back up, because things are about to happen.  What things, no one has yet to tell me.  This makes them assholes.  So, a bunch of guys and gals who just got back from Afghanistan are in a nice, large formation in the middle of a NASCAR track.  This is when the demonstration by SF happens, complete with artillery simulators, blanks, and other explosive simulations.  100 meters from a formation of guys who just got back from Afghanistan.  You can imagine how not pleasant that was.  So the demonstration ends, and the crowd cheers.  They then ""march"" us on to the the track.  It's more like gagglefuck onto the track, but whatever.  Then the audience starts cheering and clapping at us.  I felt like a piece of meat that these fucking rednecks were salivating over.  Fuck those ""tributes"".

Then we were able to get into the club level and watch an amazing win for the Hawks, and everyone was very nice and offered free drinks.   Sometimes I am kind of put off by the attention I get while in uniform. I have never been shot at and my job happens to be pretty cushy and I enjoy it very much. I don't feel worthy of the praise I get which is an insecurity of mine I suppose.   But I can't be anything but grateful to the military, to the Seahawks/NFL or anybody who wants to thank me and buy me a drink. I consider myself lucky and I think the thousands or maybe even millions of service members who have these sorts of perks should be grateful as well, whether they ""deserve"" them or not.

Military,3c21wv,lowspeedlowdrag,23,Sat Jul 4 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"This is my first comment on r/military.  I'd like to add some balance to this fireworks sign debate.  I am a retired Army First Sergeant, and am rated at 10% PTSD (no concurrent receipt).  I have had issues with fireworks in the past, but it has been several years since I have experienced severe PTSD symptoms associated with fireworks.  I will not post a sign, and wouldn't have posted one in 2004-2005 when I was experiencing my ""severe"" symptoms.  Before I share my fireworks reactions, I feel I have to ""justify"" my combat experiences since the article appears to ""minimize"" some peoples claim of combat experiences.  I have four combat deployments.  I have been shot at and shot the enemy on more than one occasion.  I have had brothers tell me they saw tracers go between my legs.  My CHU collapsed on top of me when one of the first car bombs (water truck actually) in the country destroyed our ECP.  The second one exploded about 100 feet in front of me and knocked me unconscious (killing the two guys directly in front of me) as I was getting the joes in the bunker.  I have had my vehicle (my vehicle, not convoy) hit by four IEDs.  I have been through several rocket and mortar attacks (with casualties) where I was in the ""danger zone"".  So hopefully, my combat experiences meet the litmus test to be able to make my comment below.  I live far out in the country away from civilization and neighbors.  One night, in late June (some year around mid 2000's) I was driving home on a dark two lane highway when some kids lit off a Roman candle on the shoulder about fifty feet in front of me.  I had a ""severe"" reaction.  At that moment, I was in an IED strike.  I ran off the road and got out to collect my wits and heard the teens laughing.  I made a decision to get back in the truck and go home and lower my stress with a bottle, because I knew that if I confronted them in my current emotional state, I would end up in jail and they would be effected for life.  That is not courteous fireworks behavior.  Neither are the whistling ones with loud reports after say midnight.  I don't define that as courteous fireworks behavior either.  For someone that has literally had their roof collapse on them, you can imagine the reaction at one in the morning to something as stupid as a bottle rocket.  One thing that I have learned over the years of living with PTSD is that people react differently.  What is not a trigger for you, could be for someone else.  Also, I totally agree that there are people who try to fake PTSD, and there are people who want everyone to know about their PTSD.  I am neither, and I used to have an issue with fireworks.  Please be courteous.  TL;DR:  I gots the PTSD, and think these signs are slightly ridiculous, but understand the sentiment.  Don't be an ass with your fireworks."

It's the process that I'm reporting about to this subreddit.   Once you decide to commit yourself to dealing with whatever the military plated up for you, it becomes a routine of drills and strategies. No drinking. No running away. Turn and face it. Get it in front of you. Deal with it now. This is important, for all that you think it shouldn't be that important - other people don't seem to have to deal with stuff like this.   It becomes a routine, a drill. Which is good. But the process of making your coping routine into a drill requires that you abandon hope of a quick cure, an immediate fix. You even stop thinking about getting fixed. You give up on expecting a good result because it's so tiring when the result turns out to be the same old thing. You make it back to ""all right,"" and that's it.  So I thought it was worth reporting that all your shit can sneak up on you in a good way. Get it in front of you, put it on paper, deal - and sometimes that's it. It stays on the paper. It can happen. It did happen. Who knew?  I made it up to the 4th of July. Whoopie.  Fuckin' ay.

I take a rather political view of my own time in the service, and IMHO the civilian sector in general is extremely ignorant about their own role in authorizing and pushing for Iraq...a conflict that the civilian sector does not take any blame for and instead looks for any convenient scapegoat they can find, whether it be George W. Bush, or John McCain, or Hillary Clinton, etc...  The civilian sector can very easily claim ignorance about their own role in that war, because they simply do not deal with the consequences of that war.  That's left to the military and the politicians that preside over it to deal with.

Military,3bvcrx,Dondy52,9,Fri Jul 3 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"IEDs cost about $40 in fertilizer, of which they always have tons of because Afghanistan's economy is mainly farming (opium). Then add on some bits of metal (trash usually) and some wiring that you can buy by the spool for $1 and a $2 blasting cap.   Many of our military trucks are in excess of $400,000 each. Using public information on the Wikipedia page for the MAT-V (which is a different truck but one of the common ones in Afghan) you can read about the first government procurement, the cost vs the number of trucks delivered and you come out to around $400,000.   What that doesn't count is all of the systems installed in that truck. ALL of them have 2-3 radio systems, and intercom, a night vision infrared camera on a motorized mount with a joystick to control it and other goodies. Not to mention their armor was insufficient at fielding and was upgraded after the fact.   Now a lot of that stuff survives an IED blast and gets reused, so it's not like $45 beating $600,000 every time. But it's an expensive war.   Also a service members life insurance pays out $400,000 so money wise MRAPs and armored vehicles are probably saving taxpayer dollars if you insist on being in a country with IEDs."

But it's amazing that I'm living in Japan across the world from where I grew up and it's still weird when I sit back and think about it that I'm actually here.    The language barrier is pretty hard to get over sometimes but as long as you learn a few phrases and are polite you can get around easily enough.  Japanese people are all extremely polite and are very obedient to laws... you can leave a purse or wallet on a street corner  during a parade and just walk around and unless some other Americans steal it it will still be there.  It's a huge country with plenty to do in the cities and the countryside is beautiful with plenty of hiking and skiing and whatever else you enjoy.   It has some downsides.  Getting things shipped from the states is expensive and sometimes not possible.  In the smaller towns things close down early so it's not like you can make a midnight run to Walmart for snacks.  Bars, even in Tokyo, are hilariously small compared to American ones.  Not a joke, dancing is illegal in Japan unless the club has a permit (extremely rare).  If you want to talk to a help desk in America (your bank or something) you'll have to wait until nighttime because of the time difference.   All in all its a great experience and I'd much rather be here than Kansas or some shit."

It's ok for the first 2 weeks I guess, better than being stationed at fucking bliss or polk. The curfew is pretty gay but I live off base so it sort of doesn't apply to me but it's not like I ever fucking leave my apartment after 22:00 because i have no friends. sadface  Just like every military installation ever, there's plenty of girls right outside the base hoping to take your BAH one day. If you're smart you'll invest in condoms, if not you'll be a typical SPC Fuckstick with 4 kids and a wife who can't into english. You could just remain a pure virgin like me for the rest of your life, makes things a lot easier.   AAFES sucks dick (what's new?) so you'll probably want to get the majority of your items shipped from the states even though it will cost more. If you live off base don't have it shipped to that address or else you'll be paying 2-4x more shipping costs. Army commissaries here suck dick so you'll be having to go to the nearest AF base (Yokota or Kadena) for your food shopping, or at least that's what i do once a week. I guess you could buy stuff off post but fuck that. Get a car if you can, just a cheap 1-2k dork-mobile. It looks shitty but it'll do its job. Don't be like those jack asses who buy those riced up mitsubishis for 15k and look like faglords.   Oh and for the love of all things holy, if you do have kids and are going to camp zama, your best bet is to just leave them state side or put them in one of those international american schools in tokyo.

Depending on where you're from, one of the biggest things to get used to is the weather; it's so goddamn hot and humid here and it rains.  A LOT.  Besides that, the only other real problem with being stationed here as a Marine is the liberty policy.  It's a lot different from America with a lot less freedom.  There's a curfew, can't stay off base overnight unless you have a gold card, it used to be you couldn't even go to bars or have more than two beers off base.  Some of the restrictions have been eased a bit recently but it still sucks compared to CONUS.    Okinawa is also pretty tiny, and its easy to get island fever for a lot of people.  For me personally, I just try to go out and enjoy myself and stay active on the weekends.  There's a good deal to do here if you're willing to look for it.  The scuba diving here is pretty great, there's cliff jumping, lots of good hiking, some really good cuisine to eat out in town, and some good historical sites to visit.  Overall, it's a pretty cool cultural experience, but two years is definitely more than enough time here for me."

From the Navy: ""Department of Defense Instruction 1327.06, Leave and Liberty Procedures for the Department, charges Secretaries of the Military Departments with publishing departmental guidance in accordance with the DoD instruction. Under the section that delegates to the Secretary the ability to designate the level of control for convalescent leave that exceeds 30 days, Secretary Mabus has directed that commanding officers grant additional convalescent leave up to 84 days beyond the currently authorized 42 days of convalescent leave following the birth of a child.""

DHS head even told congress he had already fired 3 foreign nationals at OPM who were working in positions that were supposed to be US civs only when he found out about the 2 admins and the chinese dude was freaking loging in from fucking China.  luckily this info was almost certainly gathered to help turn humint sources.

Military,3bw6za,twelveparsex,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:28:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" has fast become a term of magnitude instead of an absolute.   I don't believe that people have an absolute reasonable expectation of privacy in nearly any situation, including sitting at home in their own home that they own.  We live in a world where you can buy a thermal camera off Amazon and ""see"" through the blinds of someone's windows. You could probably rig up a microphone that would allow you to pick up their ""private"" conversations while sitting in a public space nearby (like a street). To say nothing of the incredible cameras we have today at even the consumer level. WW2 spies would kill for the kind of information gathering capabilities you could find at WalMart in 2015, and a culture which has an intense desire to blast as much of its personal information all over the world as possible.   50 years from now? Privacy will almost certainly be wholly dead in every traditional sense. Everyone will know exactly what everyone else's genitals look like, what kind of porn they watch, and whether they're cheating on their spouse. We're just going to have to get over the idea that we can have secrets.  So when I say that I have ""a reasonable expectation of privacy"", I do not mean I'm reasonably sure that my information will be absolutely private. I do mean that I'm reasonably sure that it will take a significant amount of resources to compromise that privacy, to the point where it just isn't worthwhile."

There is an expectation that the money will be kept secure and the there are industry standard security protocols they follow, if it's stolen the bank is insured.  Why can't cloud service providers and the government be held to similar standards?    The concept is basically the same:  information is stored privately on the Internet and certain protocols should be met to prevent unauthorized access to said information; if the information is capable of doing more damage then tougher protocols need to be put in place."

Military,3bw6za,PM_ME_ANYTHING_PLS_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:01:22 2015 UTC,"On Thursday, 9 July, OPM announced the results of the interagency forensics investigation into a second recent cyber incident involving federal background investigation data and the steps it is taking to protect those impacted. OPM confirmed an incident affecting background investigation records of current, former, and prospective federal employees, military members, and contractors. The interagency team has now concluded with high confidence that sensitive information, including the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of 21.5 million individuals, was stolen from the background investigation databases. This includes 19.7 million individuals that applied for a background investigation, and 1.8 million non-applicants, predominantly spouses or co-habitants of applicants.  Some records also include findings from interviews conducted by background investigators and approximately 1.1 million included fingerprints. If an individual underwent a background investigation through OPM in 2000 or afterwards (which occurs through the submission of standard forms (SF) 86, 85, or 85P for a new background investigation or periodic reinvestigation), it is highly likely that the individual is impacted by this cyber breach. If an individual underwent a background investigation prior to 2000, that individual still may be impacted, but it is less likely. Significant numbers of current, former, and prospective military members and government civilians, as well as contractors, have been affected.  This additional loss of data affects a much larger group of Department of the Navy (DON) members than the incident announced in June.  Timely and accurate information will continue to be available at:  http://www.secnav.navy.mil/OPMBreachDON.   Part of the email I got from the navy.   Looks like service members as well."

Military,3btrxo,DocBraz,24,Thu Jul 2 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"My wife used to have to this kind of stuff for the July 1 parades.  Apparently they line you up a good four to five hours before hand to ensure nothing goes wrong and also simply in part because the total number of units means it's quite the line to get past the reviewing stand.  They used to take multiples units, pull out all the Manchurians for fear they couldn't handle the heat, and then move people around to fill in the gaps/equalize height/combine units/etc.  Apparently over multiple years she only actually marched as a member of her unit once."
Military,3btrxo,Cai_E,14,Thu Jul 2 04:40:50 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining a few things for me?  First: July 1? Canada Day?  Second: Manchurians? From China? So your wife served in the Chinese Army?  Interesting :)
Military,3btrxo,squaresarerectangles,7,Thu Jul 2 13:49:01 2015 UTC,July 1 = date the Chinese Communist Party was founded.   Manchuria is up in the north so I assume people from there might have a harder time with the heat. China can get hot as balls.
Military,3btrxo,funkymustafa,8,Thu Jul 2 14:44:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 1 July is founding of the CPC as well as Canada Day.    Manchurians are kind of China's version of Siberians (although Siberia is worse).  Extremely large, greater than 6' is getting to be the norm as nutrition improves, and supposedly they don't handle heat well according to popular stereotype.   My wife was conscripted into the officer's program during her college education.  She spent her undergrad program and law degree programing doing political stuff (political education, marching, etc).  In the summer they would send her out to Inner Mongolia for training, she led a heavy weapons platoon (mortars, RPGs, 12.7mm and 14.5mm MGs, etc).  Barracks life was all the stuff designed to create unit cohesion (so shitty stuff where shared suffering is supposed to make you bond) and small unit tactics.  It's like a shitty off brand Hell Week or something that goes on for most of the summer.  This was because she was studying social sciences and the party wanted to make sure she got a good dose of patriotism and nationalism through the pride of military service and thus wouldn't become an activist or such.  Didn't work.  This approach had its flaws, in that for example during the Tiananmen Square when the student led protests occurred, the CPC realized it's hard to activate a unit when most of its junior officers are on the other side of the protest line.  The Beijing Garrison was by and large pro-protest, those tanks and everything were called in from bases outside the city and there were actually limited firefights between them and the Beijing troops.  I once had an officer from that era explain to me those tanks were a follow on unit and the first tanks to cross into the city were set on fire via molotov cocktails that just happened to leave penetration holes like an anti tank weapon would.    One of the O-5s in another Beijing unit they shared space with was having a second kid under the table (you just had to pay lots of fines if you hide the pregnancy).  He knocked up his wife on leave (she was living with family in a different province), she sent him a letter telling him it would be a son, but the unit's political officer was reading his mail, never gave that particular letter to the O-5, and instead called back to that province and order and abortion performed.  Procedure killed the wife.  Husband only found out when his brother came to Beijing and told him.  He walked into the political officer's office with a loaded AK-47, put two in the political guy's skull and then headed for the government center where he died in a shootout with central party security.  It all was kind of surreal.    It's a whole different military culture.  She loves the movie Patton, but absolutely cannot understand why he would get in trouble for slapping that soldier.  A kick in the back of the head apparently was basically how officers said ""Hey, how was your weekend?"" to enlisted when she was in."

That's the why military parades and pass in reviews exist. They emphasize the discipline and the might of a military unit. They're used to instill confidence in the people watching them, and let people know that they're in good hands.  You can't take civilians into a battlefield to show them how good your marksmanship and tactics are. You can't bring them into a TOC and show them how well your command team communicates.

Improvisation and adaptability, which hopefully everyone recognizes as vital components for victory, are smaller aspects of creativity... study any famous general/admiral, tactician or martial artist and you'll see their creativity all over their victories.

Thirty-five years ago KGB Chairman Mao knew he was losing the Cold War before the rest of the world had a clue. He instituted Project Indeyka. Using the cover of nuclear testing they began experimenting and mutating turkeys. They created hyper aggressive, rapidly reproducing communist turkeys. They passed along these technological secrets and special Siberian Turkey training techniques to Soviet Spy cells across the contiguous United States. Soon these Soviet cells acted totally independent of Moscow. Following the fall of the Soviet Union these units went dark until the election of President Obama. Detecting weakness in his leadership style and suspecting communist sympathies they began insurgent strikes against strategic U.S. sites. The CIA had long been at work creating a counter-turkey unit of crack Pinniped commandos called the ""Navy Seals"". A human unit with the same name was created to act as a cover, generating as much publicity as possible and creating plausible deniability. The true Navy Seals effectively exploite turkey weaknesses and kill thousands of Soviet turkey insurgents on a weekly basis. The war rages on but to this day there had been zero human fatalities. Because of the panic that would be caused by the implications of deadly intelligent poultry and marine mammals, as well as the terrible threat they present to the safety of this nation, absolute secrecy must be maintained. The turkey insurgent bodies are disposed of in the bellies and bowels of unsuspecting joes in every military branch and also turkey is surprisingly cheap."

After WWII, most turkeys were sold for the holidays, with a huge number of mature birds unused the rest of the year.  An executive at Swanson's got the idea of making frozen TV dinners from the airlines, but in disposable, partitioned aluminum trays, so people could have simple dinners of turkey year around.  ""In 1952, Swanson & Sons introduced their TV brand TV dinner, selling 5,000 units its first year. A year later the company had sold over 10,000,000 TV dinners.  In April 1955, Swanson's 4,000 employees and 20 plants were acquired by the Campbell Soup Company.""  Importantly, this came on the heels of another huge breakthrough, but in chicken.  In 1948, the A&P supermarket chain (and the USDA) held a national contest to develop, a larger, meatier chicken that matured faster and ate less than other chickens.  The Chicken of Tomorrow contest.  Almost all the chickens we eat today are descended from the winners of that contest, though some ""heritage chickens"" remain.  Maturity in 4-7 weeks instead of 16 weeks.  So shortly thereafter chicken TV dinners joined with turkey TV dinners, with beef following up later."

Military,3bvylc,Strikerrr0,3,Fri Jul 3 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"The gun is more accurate (5 milliradians [same as the A-10's GAU-8] vs 8 milliradians), has a slower maximum fire rate (3300 vs 6000/min) and fires larger rounds (25x137mm vs 20x102mm - weight wise; 223g vs 151g).  The F-35's cannon also fires a new type of ammo called APEX, which is designed to handle both hard and soft targets better than traditional SAPHEI rounds; you can read more about in here."

Military,3bvulg,lilchubber,2,Thu Jul 2 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"The jobs of enlisted and officer are totally different. There are benefits to having an officer who understands what it is like to be enlisted, but since the jobs are different there are advantages to making it a separate process where the officers join as officers. Thats how most other countries do it including the US and it's worked so far   In the Navy, the officers are supposed to look outward. They need to understand what the rest of the ship is doing. They need to stand watch on the bridge and be responsible for the entire ship within the first two years of being in the Navy. The enlisted personnel never have that much responsibility in their own hands. Their job is to look inward, doing their job and doing it well. They need to be the experts in their field. The officers cant do that.  In an infantry platoon, the enlisted job is to be the expert rifleman. You shoot straight and you shoot well. The officer is supposed to know the mission. They know about the other units in the area, and they know what their unit has to do for the big picture. They are responsible for the entire unit and its actions.  Officers are trained for this purpose. Enlisted are trained for their jobs. The compartmentalization allows each to become experts at what they do. The officers then have their SNCO's by their side to advise them on things they might need to know to operate effectively. This ensures that the officer can make the right decisions regarding the big picture while the NCO makes sure the decisions are made around the constraints of the unit and what they can and cant do.  I wouldn't worry about it too much. It works the way it is. Sometimes the prior enlisted officers are great, but they have their own bad examples just as the regular officers do."
Military,3bvulg,lilchubber,2,Fri Jul 3 01:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah i fully understand your points and i agree and i'm also aware of this. Though i feel like there is a important line to be drawn here.   My granddad (former private, then sergeant and then officer in the danish army and a former craftsman) described the problem to me as this;   When i was a craftsman we had engineers who were suppose to look at the bigger picture and tell us how to construct building in a certain way and what to build with, and then we would be the experts in actually knowing how to hit a nail og saw through a piece of wood or whatever.  The point is that some of these engineers who were academic and themselves hadn't been craftsmen once upon a time had no idea what it was like to be one and therefore he could not relate to our problems or even listen to us when we suggested things, because he's was an academic engineer schooled in the right way and we should just do as he said, we had no respect for these type of folks, and even though some of them were nice we just couldn't respect them for not knowing how we worked.  This reminds me alot about the military and really helped me during my short period as an officer, that i knew what it was like to be a normal infantry soldier, i knew i couldn't be their boss i had to be their leader to gain their respect so i always had to show the way and be a part of the team and not distance myself"""
Military,3bvulg,Tony49UK,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:40:32 2015 UTC,"Thats a good point. In the US navy, we are taught to listen to our chiefs, and that we don't know anything. Every once in a while you get an officer who thinks they know everything, but as a new officer serving on a deployed ship for a week I have absolutely no idea how anyone could think they know anything at all...  It works out very well much more often than it doesn't. The Chief's mess takes pride in their opportunity to train the new ensigns to be good officers. The wardroom reminds the new ensigns that they are worthless without their chiefs. The best officers are the ones who listen to their senior enlisted and then apply what they know to the real world. In reality, the SNCO's run the unit, you just make sure the unit works well with other units. When the training was done right this works very well so the officer can focus on their job rather than the job of their subordinates."

Of course if it was possible, any economist would tell you that completely and utterly doing away with the military would increase economic activity, as military goods are non-productive goods.  However, if a military is absolutely necessary, and the broad consensus is that it is, the idea becomes how to go about fulfilling this necessity requirement.  Voluntarily fulfilling a necessary requirement would be like asking someone to choose when their heart beats.  One bad choice and you got a critical situation.  One possible solution is to just preclude that choice to begin with and to assume that requirement will always be fulfilled."

We've already got a much more effective solution to this problem though, a system of incentives that encourages people to seek out the military on a voluntary basis, instead of a series of disincentives for not undertaking military service (as in a mandatory service system).   If the military was hurting for recruits, it might be a different issue."
Military,3byhxu,wahtisthisidonteven,-1,Sun Jul 5 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"One could very, very easily argue that the military was hurting for recruits during the Iraq war.  Public military consensus was that we needed far more troops in Iraq than what we deployed, and that deploying more from the existing pool of reservists would put undue strain upon the system.  The army during this time began recruiting felons in order to meet stated recruiting quotas.  We needed several times the number of troops deployed to properly occupy Iraq.  It follows that with inadequate resources for an occupation, that security would not be provisioned and that sectarian violence and other forms of insurgencies would erupt from that country.  The military advised before and during the war that this was the probable outcome that would result from not providing the military with the number of soldiers it requested.  To call what occurred in Iraq ""a much more effective solution"" is absurd."

The idea is to instill the body politic with a realistic assessment of the price of war.  2) As far as costs are concerned, at any period of time you'd probably have a doubling, or tripling, of the current force (assuming that any 2-year demographic of military-capable individuals, for example 19-21 year olds, would consist of maybe 3% of the total population).  I'm fairly certain you would not be arming these conscripts like you would the rest of the military, so no F-22s or Stryker ICVs for them."

Now do that for every rifle, barracks, medical facility, work building, etc.    Also you have to look at training.  Training new recruits runs from the tens to the hundreds of thousands of dollars per individual.  Also, if you have a conscript for two years, around six months of that will be training, add on another month or two of OJT and you have a less than a year and a half of use out of a conscript.

This sounded like the plane was interrupting at very inopportune times when there was little risk involved.  Basically it sounds like software set to a modest setting.

Ok, so the F-35 BVR missile of choice the AMRAAM, a missile that's notoriously unreliable at the best of times, and we know from all available data that the F-35 is quite slow relative to every other modern fighter jet on the planet.  Scenario: F-35 launches missiles, all missiles miss, it can't outrun its opponent and now it dies because it ""wasn't built to dogfight""."

Could it be possible that F-35 must be able to wing visual range combat to survive aftermath of typical BVR fight? Could it be that effective BVR combat happens very close to visual range?

Military,3bsaqm,GTFOCFTO,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:32:24 2015 UTC,It has better capabilities against difficult ground targets than F-35.  Can drop bombs from higher and longer distance with more speed. If we  want it to.
Military,3bsaqm,sci901,5,Thu Jul 2 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"The F-22 can drop bombs from higher and longer distance with more speed, but it's limited to =<1,000lb bombs, plus the only targeting and guidance option is radar and GPS.  The F-35A can drop =<2,000lb bombs and can target and guide with radar and GPS, or EO and laser. Even if it can't drop bombs from as high or fast as the F-22, the F-35 offers more options.   Against difficult (hardened) ground targets, the F-35A's pair of 2,000lb bombs would go further than the F-22's pair of 1,000lb bombs.   Against difficult (defended) ground targets, we're probably talking about using JSOWs and not JDAMs. The F-35A/C can pack a pair of JSOWs internally, the F-22 cannot carry any internally."

Military,3bsaqm,GoldieMMA,5,Wed Jul 1 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"Most aircraft have AOA limiters to help prevent pilots from stalling their aircraft or exceeding the FBW's ability to maintain control; for the F-35 it's currently (and was originally intended to be) 50 degrees, but that might change if they fix the pitch rate software and want to capitalise on it's high alpha abilities."

Military,3bsaqm,metalheadninja,2,Thu Jul 2 15:11:04 2015 UTC,Not necessarily; Hornet pilots sometimes utilise their high alpha abilities (being able to push 70+ degrees) early in the fight to cut across a turning circle and hit the enemy before their superior sustained turn rates kick in.

Military,3bsaqm,bogeydoper,3,Wed Jul 1 22:24:16 2015 UTC,"Possibly just a caution until the testing was complete? Official limitations for aircraft often don't correlate with physical limits.

Military,3bqbdi,saargrin,18,Wed Jul 1 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"The Russians have been a bit more circumspect than they were in Crimea where they drove vehicles with Russian military registration plates and openly admitted they were Russian military when asked by the press.    That said, there have been sightings of T-72BMs/T-72B1s being operated by separatist forces, which is a strong indicator of Russian involvement since neither model tank were ever officially exported."
Military,3bqbdi,squaresarerectangles,3,Wed Jul 1 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"Both are cold war tanks, when the USSR collapsed large numbers of military equipment were sold without any official paperwork. It's just as likely they are illegally sold Russian equipment rather than ""support of Russian backing.""  Edit let me restate, I personally think Russia is involved but saying cold war era tanks have been sighted is nowhere near evidence of backing by Russia, simply evidence of large scale cash flow/ or theft."
Military,3bqbdi,Zigmura,2,Wed Jul 1 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't believe any went to Ukraine. IIRC they got T-80s, T-64s, and T-62s."
Military,3bqbdi,Isaac0398,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"Again ""illegally exported"", meaning no paperwork, no official routes they would essentially be black market at that point.  edit also Russia has a known reputation of dealing with shady third world countries that could very well have sold them off to another somewhat shady country that gave or sold them to whoever. Perhaps even to the point of selling them to a country they know would give them to the anti Ukrainian forces thereby eliminating a paper trail from then to anyone in Ukraine while still actively participating.   Point being there's more solid proof of Russia's involvement besides tanks."

Military,3bse3x,Zigmura,6,Thu Jul 2 02:55:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's still up in the air whether Chaplains can be forced to marry gay couples.  On September 30, 2011, the Pentagon issued a directive to all military chaplains to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and to make military chapels available for any such private ceremonies.  In response, the Catholic Archdiocese for Military Service issued a statement that no Catholic chaplains serving in the military will perform or participate in any same-sex marriage ceremonies at any military chapels.  Members of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty have issued a statement indicating that they will also not participate in performing same-sex ceremonies.  As has the Evangelical Chaplain's Association.  Activist Mikey Weinstein, president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, is demanding the U.S. military conduct a purge of chaplains who refuse to conduct homosexual marriages."
Military,3bse3x,WendyLRogers3,10,Thu Jul 2 09:21:58 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one.  Personally, I don't think it's cool to force chaplains to either forsake what the church tells them to do or end their careers. Having chaplains around is a privilege, I've used their services on occasion, and I wouldn't want there to be a rift.  Besides, you can get married off post. I can see not keeping a chaplain who says ""I'm not going to minister to or provide counseling for homosexuals or homosexual couples"""
Military,3bse3x,SabotPetals,8,Thu Jul 2 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"Because chaplains swore an oath to obey the UCMJ, without hesitation or reservation.  Meaning they put this oath above the oath they took to their church.  So chaplain obeys orders from their church, and disobeys order from superior, chaplain violates UCMJ, violates oath, and should get punished the same as an E3 who does the same.  In reality, chaplain gets a counseling statement and a hug and cookie and sent back to work."
Military,3bse3x,SabotPetals,2,Thu Jul 2 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"Well, so did I, because the UCMJ doesn't include anything that goes against my moral code, so I have no issues dispensing the duties of my commission. A good leader understands that their orders should not violate laws or a reasonable person's moral code. So they have to approach this chaplain issue lightly. Which they won't, lol.

This ruling does not change those rules that have already been in place for years no matter what Fox ""news"" may be screaming at everyone.   Any military chaplain or clergy can refuse to perform a same sex marriage ""if it is not in line with the tenets of their faith."" But same-sex couples are free to pick their own clergy member to perform their ceremony.    http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/same-sex-marriage-ruling-extends-all-u-s-military-bases-n382601  More:  http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/jan/31/hagel-military-chaplains-wont-be-forced-do-same-se/  http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/p165_17/main.asp  However they may be required to redirect to another chaplain or civilian clergy that will perform the service.

Military,3bsazd,erickbaka,8,Thu Jul 2 05:18:29 2015 UTC,"Not really; the Navy lost a couple of F/A-18C classic Hornets last year, and they were valuated to have been a loss of ~$74.5 and $77.3 million each. An F-35A, when it goes into full-rate production, is expected to cost around $80 million by 2019, including inflation (Lockheed believes <$80 million, but let's at least be a little conservative here). In today's dollars, that's meant to be roughly $75 million."

The data is interesting in its own way, but how often do you hear about knife-fighters sneaking up on snipers and taking them down? Never, although one has to think that there's at least a theoretical chance of that happening. It's just that in practice, it never does."
Military,3bsazd,justaname84,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:10:27 2015 UTC,"The first question I asked in my head when I read the blog post was ""How would the F-16's radar lock onto the F-35 and provide data to the HUD to assist the F-16 pilot? The F-16's radar is all but incapable of seeing an F-35. This isn't the 1940s anymore, at the speeds modern aircraft dogfight at it is almost impossible to shoot the cannon without radar assistance.""   Second, AF-2 does not have the special stealth coating that operational F-35s have that make them virtually invisible to radar.   Oh.  If AF-2 had been a real F-35 the F-16's fire control radar would not have even been able to aim the cannon at it.   I guess the F-16 pilot could have rammed the F-35..."

Military,3bug1v,Zigmura,2,Thu Jul 2 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"It honestly depends on what kind of person you are.  Some people do well away from family and some people don't.  I went through Ft. Knox in 2010 and I had a blast.  Sure being away from family sucks but you're also usually so busy that you don't have time to think about them other than on downtime.  After basic I got stationed at Ft. Lewis, so the only time I got to see my family was once a year whenever we went on block leave.  As for personal friends, don't worry about them.  Almost all of them are going to go their separate ways and you most likely won't talk to or see them for the next several years.  You will make new friends in the Army, and they will be the best friends you've ever had.  Have fun at basic, keep your eyes and ears open, your mouth shut, and take lots of notes.  Do exactly what you are told when you are told and you will make it through no problem."

Military,3bmiwb,plipyplop,5,Wed Jul 1 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the officers would have more creature comforts in the ward room during the officer's mess. Difrrent bottles of wine and so forth. Whatever meat would have been cured in salt and pretty awful to choke down.   Enlisted mess would have been hard tac and water that is basically two steps from rancid.   One of my favorite book series has a couple chapters in it that talk about the main character being on a boat. All things being equal, I would rather have been a ground troop over a sailor. Although being a sailor did have its perks. You could actually start out as an enlisted sailor and work to become an officer through merit. In the British army, comissions and ranks were bought to ensure the aristocracy was leading the military, the ranks were successively more expensive to ensure people of higher social class had higher military rank rank.

Soldiers back then complained about the same things we do now. Shoes aren't good enough, girl left me, food sucks, we march too much.   One of the most interesting thing I read in the series. Well, not really interesting, just, well I was impressed. As you know, when you're fighting, you can work up a hell of a thirst. Well, the same thing was true back then. The only difference was that they were biting those bullet package for every shot they took. One of the ingredients in gunpowder is saltpeter. That makes you REALLY BLOODY THIRSTY.   Now, water wasn't super available all the time. So often times, the soldiers would drink the same water used to swab the artillery pieces.

Basically in the books the soldiers take meticulous care of their weapons. The guys that Richard Sharpe is commanding, they seem basically the shit bags of the army. He takes it upon himself to turn them into a damn good company. He succeeds, he has a couple different rules about keeping your weapons servicable and yourself ready to fight.  Man, I can't recommend these books enough. The three that take place in India set the stage for the rest of the sharp series. As a,vet, you'll get more out of these books than the average bear. I even bet you'll see a bit of yourself in a few of the characters too.   It's all there, grunts being upset at higher for being rear echelon douchebags, logistics being fucked up, military intelligence getting things laughably wrong. Hell, even Jody is there."

Military,3bmiwb,squaresarerectangles,8,Wed Jul 1 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  If I am unmistaken, the only rations that have alcohol nowadays is the Italian breakfast Modules B,F.   Two of the seven Italian ration modules (B and F) contain an item called ""Cordiale/bevanda alcolica"", or Cordial/alcoholic beverage. This is a 3 cl ""shot"" of a brandy-like liquor in a plastic bottle. The specification for this particular ration item say it must be no less than 70 proof (40°) alcohol and ""Its appearance should be clear, pale yellow amber, with a pleasing smell and taste.""   This is a great way to start the day.  Edit: From what I understand, the alcohol no longer comes in a bottle but instead comes in something resembling an elongated clear ketchup packet."

Military,3bmiwb,86gttogo,5,Tue Jun 30 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"I think I read something about that elsewhere on reddit. Europe (or at least Britain) uses a different formula for proof than we do.

Other very funny anecdote from the book is when the platoon leader's course is moved from a place near London to the Brecon Beacons, I believe--the location of an NCO training course. There is a story that when the LT's go to the local pub, a woman who hooked  up with an NCO previously was approached by an LT who said, ""Want to see my member?"".

The 2010 doctrine “reserves nuclear weapons for situations that are more serious” than a hypothetical situation in which NATO conducts an operation in Chechnya similar to the Kosovo war and defeats Russia, Sokov said.

Aside from that, any local state university or junior college also should be pretty solid.   Speaking specifically to the cyber world, like it's been mentioned, avoid the bullshit cottage industry of ""Cybersecurity specialty certificate blah blah blah"" that's been popping up recently. If you really want to know your stuff and stick out in the cyber/CS/IT world, go for a real IT or CS degree. Pick up as much math as you can, and get your hands dirty in real programming classes, not ""Wordpress for Business Majors"". Yes, it will be much harder, but definitely worth it  To underline the point: compare a UMUC ""Cybersecurity Management and Policy"" degree to a BS in Comp Sci from Florida State University Online. With the FSU degree you're picking up all your general ed requirements, as well as Calc I and II, physics, and a comp sci curriculum that includes C/C++, object-oriented programming, software engineering, databases, operating systems, programming langauge theory, discrete mathematics, and computational theory. That is a serious degree, and I guarantee anyone coming out of that program would wipe the floor with anyone from the ""Cybersecurity Management and Policy"" program"

Things may have changed in recent years but I was Army 87-89 at Ft Sill and I was able to rack up 33 credits from CLEP tests that easily transferred to my state university when I got out. Academically I was already a sophomore before I actually set foot on campus. Saved a full year of college costs which is a lot more valuable now than it was in the early 90's. If I remember correctly, CLEP tests were free and there was no downside if you took a test and didn't hit the minimum score other than (I think) not being able to take that same test again for some period of time. I was a middling high school student but I found the tests to be pretty easy to pass just with a high school education. At Ft Sill they administered the tests at the Education Center and I was there pretty much every week we weren't in the field. My platoon sergeant supported this wholeheartedly and it even helped me get promoted faster - something like ""taking initiative to better himself"" or whatever.

Military,3bnrar,oneupmanshipwreck,8,Tue Jun 30 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"I did exactly one reconnaissance mission when I was a Combat Medic.  I was attached to an armored company, so we normally either rolled tanks as a show of force or did joint foot patrols with the Peshmerga.  When we did those missions, we rocked it.  Fucked some fighters up, instilled fear into local cells, and our Peshmerga brothers found out how to fight very effectively.  We were by no means incompetent or even bad at our jobs.  Well, for about a month our S2 had been getting information about a local JAM/AQI cell transporting weapons and gear up and down the Tigris River.  Because our battalion's scout platoon was busy doing scout stuff, my platoon was tasked with gathering intelligence on their distribution areas.  I was fucking stoked.  There was a pretty good chance we would catch these dudes in the act, and there was a very good chance we were going to fuck them up.  Well, our PSG decided we only needed six of the seventeen of us for this particular creep.  The other eleven would stay behind in four MRAPs and act as a QRF if we came into contact.  If we did, the QRF had something like three clicks to cover before they got to us, so it was important we hold out for as long as possible.  Our PSG split the six of us dismounts into two teams:  Team 1:   PSG (E7). PSG's driver who was assigned the 320 (E4). Myself, the Medic (E4).   Team 2:   LT, who acted as the RTO (O2). A SSG tank commander, who also had a shotgun (E6). The SSG's driver, who was assigned a SAW (E3).   We were basically the fire team.  If we came into contact, we'd provide a base of fire so Team 2 could maneuver to kill whoever was shooting at us.  Pretty basic, by the books.  We were all given two grenades, one smoke and one flare.  Some of us used coal to darken our faces.  We all applied 100mph tape to our strobe's switches, and took off everything that rattled and shined.  I had been in combat before, but gearing up for this one felt intense.  I'd like to say we came into contact, fucked some dudes up, recovered enemy supplies and weapons and saved the day.    That did not happen at all.  The area we traversed was basically farmland, and all of it had been recently tilled.  Most of us were struggling to stand upright, let alone trying not to trip every five feet.  I didn't even use my NOD's 75% of the time.  You have virtually no depth perception with PVS-7's, so I had an easier time moving around without them on.  I basically only used them whenever we halted movement.  When we got to the Tigris, we found evidence that they had been there shortly before our arrival.  We estimated there were approximately eight to twelve guys present, so it would have been pretty intense had we got into a firefight with them.  Then the LT got the wise idea to cross the river at it's most shallow point, which turned out to be about 3ft deep.  The SSG was almost swept away, which is pretty impressive considering he was like 6'3"", 230lbs.  PSG decided we had done enough, so we all moved back to the vehicles.  On top of all that, the area we were in was adjacent to a village that sat on a hill.  That village had a dominating view of us the entire time we were there.  We would have gotten fucked up pretty badly if they decided to fight us from that position.  I kept thinking of it the entire time, yet nothing happened.  I'm pretty sure they just watched us and laughed as we trudged through all the bullshit we came across.  Our SAW gunner ate dirt a few times.  Team 2 was absolutely soaked.  I ended up humping extra SAW ammo because our gunner had fucked his ankle up on our way back.    The entire mission took us six hours to complete.  It was a fucking mess.  From that night on, I have the utmost respect for 19D's.  If they can do that shit, then they're deserving of a beer or two."

Kuwait is a field trip, not a deployment. Infantry life is boring as fuck right now.   What branch of the Army would be best for that?   SF or ranger bat, but even ranger bat is revving down a little from what i hear.   would reserve/active be better   Now that most deployments are just a field trip to kuwait and the rest of your time is dog and pony bullshit i'd say just stay in the guard. Unless you can hack it in SF/ranger bat."

My Sgt was also former Ranger Bat, he taught me how to box, and told me a bit about life in the Rangers. (He was IRR, pissed he had to report but otherwise a cool guy, very intense about tacos)  What about respeccing into a different MOS? Are there any that I could go into that would get me downrange for a year or two so I can get my shit in order?"

If you are curious, the current method the US Army uses is a program called Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V). It is integrated in Army vehicle systems for quick reference and was even released as an app a few years ago (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.usa.rocv&hl=en). Pretty much the same as the cards, but there are modern details such as the vehicle's signature when viewed under thermal optics."
