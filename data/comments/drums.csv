drums,3e2aob,WhiskeyFudge,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"What is the module here? Do you like it?   I have a Roland TD4 for practicing but I don't like the idea of a full electronic kit for gigging, and something like this looks pretty perfect and a lot of fun!"
drums,3e2aob,NostalgicMuscovy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"What is the module here?   It's a Roland Octopad. There are inputs for addition pads, so right now I am also using a Roland kick too.  I'm still experimenting with the set up. I tried just the Octopad, but didn't like that at all. Then I tried the Octopad with a real hi-hat and an additional v-pad. That wasn't so bad.  This was my third ""live gig"" experimental set up and like it the best so far, but the snare can be a bit overpowering, hence the towel muffle.   The onboard kits sound ""good enough"" but I have heard some samples that are just outrageous. They are a bit pricey so I am still debating whether to pull the trigger on them.  Overall, I have been surprised by the feedback of other musicians (whom I thought would hate anything non-acoustic), and the general audience, most of whom don't even seem to notice there isn't a real drumset back there.   I do find myself having to concentrate a bit more so that my phrasing (for fills and tom work) stays consistent with what I would use on a normal kit set-up. That's also important when playing the percussion sounds."
drums,3e2aob,gwrjones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:49 2015 UTC,Don't splash out on those samples! The octapad doesn't work as a sampler. Just the onboard kits. You need an spd-sx or similar for that. You can do a lot with the sounds on board though.

I worked through it on my own, then moved to drum set at 10 for 5th grade band. Been playing ever since and am 26 now.  Musical Timeline:  Before I could walk: Mom propped me up on piano (she is a music teacher) and I began bashing the keys with my chubby baby hands.  3-9: Piano lessons, basic theory, rhythm, etc.  9-10: Drumming introduced to my life. More or less self-taught with lesson books. YouTube was not invented yet.  12-15: Learned guitar and bass to pick up girls and play in bar bands.  15-18: Drumming and bass take over as I filled in with more bands and more projects. Playing bass = guaranteed work.  18-24: Army Bands. Played guitar, bass, drums, sang, and ran sound engineering team. Drumming was my third instrument as we had a kick ass drummer already.  24-Present: Drumming back to number 1. Still practice my guitar and bass a few times a week. Sing when I can. I don't play piano anymore."

drums,3e335m,lord_of_vader,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Not really. Being in band in middle school was pretty easy. I already knew theory from piano lessons so that wasn't hard at all. 5 years later I joined drum line and learned 90% of what I know from there. That was enough for me to figure out how to move rudiments from a snare and put them on the kit. By this time I had been playing drum set in jazz band for a few years. High school was a breeze. No lessons. I was decent enough.   After that I joined Army Band and had my first real lessons at age 18. That was a real eye-opener.  Now, I don't think lessons would be worth my time. By that I mean the amount of investment to return thing. I am an alright drummer. I get by. I can hold my own with various styles."

Recently, I've been seeing this guy, looked to be in his early 20's, taking drumset lessons from him, and I can tell he's just starting out because the teacher's telling him the basics, like time signatures, the difference between a quarter note and an eighth note, etc. The guy was just having the best time. He was joking, laughing, playing the exercises, and just overall have fun. So basically my point is, if you're having fun with it, it doesn't matter when you start."

There was a bit of a hiatus for a few years.

Then they clean them on the lathe with cleaner. Then they re-ink and re-stamp. They then will dip them with their brilliant finish coating. Hang to dry and return to owner.  They offer this as a service on their site. Not sure of the price. I have a small endorsement with them.

drums,3e41qg,Onikouzou,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this advice might seem counter intuitive but continue listening to harder and harder tracks. I believe that a major component of creativity is to be able to synthesise knowledge in new ways but you first must expose yourself to as much as possible!   If you're feeling like covering songs is getting too easy, push yourself to cover more challenging songs to complete note for note accuracy. I personally have been trying to transcribe out some more Animals as Leaders and Chon songs to cover - that might be a good point to start if you're feeling like you're at a somewhat advanced level. I haven't met a drummer in my life that can learn some of the more tricky AAL tracks off the Joy of Motion within a few days.  As you continue to expose yourself and force yourself to learn new and more challenging drum parts, you'll begin to automatically incorporate them in your playing in your own style."
drums,3e41qg,Yeast000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"I would start off by copying fills from songs you like or just inserting simple fills - after the song is written, you can go back later and experiment to improve your fills. With the exception of fills that rhythmically or melodically match the music, it shouldn't hinder the band too much.  It all kind of boils down to time... time to learn, time to write, time to practice. Definitely try and experiment with different types of fills though - check out the innumerable fill tutorials on YouTube or get a book if you prefer to work that way and just try applying one or two to your music."

drums,3e41qg,Seafroggys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"My top three things: different meters, rudiments, and forcing yourself to use different concepts.  The hardest one for me is consciously using rudiments. I don't do this anywhere near as much as I should. Basically, take some random rudiments, and force yourself to come up with different orchestrations for it. I've done it a lot with paradiddle-diddles. I just did it the other day with paradiddles. I wanted some paradiddle groove with toms incorporated. When I'm played RLRR LRLL between the hi-hat and snare, I would throw a tom hit with the right hand on that third right-handed note. Just one example.  What works better for me is forcing myself to use certain concepts. Like throw a quintuplet in somewhere, or a septuplet. Or play a fill using sixteenths on the ride. Or use quarter note triplets. Something along those lines.  What I really love the most though is picking some odd meter and just improvising in it. Don't just pick something boring like 5/4 either. 7/8 and 9/8 are good, but 11/8 and 13/8 are better, you have to really come up with something there. For hard mode, go for something over 16. I love 19/16, but use things like 13/16, 15/16, 17/16, 21/16, 23/16, and more too.  I guess I should throw in learning more stuff you don't normally listen to or play. I just learned a baião samba pattern the other day, it's really cool. Incorporate stuff that's based in Latin, hip-hop, electronic music, country, etc. It can get pretty awesome.  And good luck!"

I then load my audio into Audacity (after I mix it and everything, but that's beyond the scope of your question).  I cut out all the audio prior to that first click.  I then use the Add Silence command to the front of the track, and I'll put in the exact amount of time that I got from the video.  I then save the audio, and load it into virtualdub.

drums,3e43b8,SnareSpectre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"I record my drumming audio and video separately because the onboard mic for most cameras is pretty bad, and a very good portable audio recorder is very affordable. Also, the audio directly from my cameras (GoPros) is always a few frames out of sync. In order to line up my drum audio with the drumless track I do the following:   Add a 2 beat click sound to the beginning of the drumless track  Hold my headphones up to the recording mic so those clicks get played onto the drum track  Manually line up the clicks from both audio files in my wav editing program  To line up the video, I find a crash or hit that is visible in all cameras, which I place at a very easy to find spot, like 5 sec / 10 sec, ect.  When editing the videos, I find that exact frame and move it to the indicated spot.  This took me quite a long time and many, many videos to figure out properly."

drums,3e3dnk,big_floppy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"The recording and music production process is abit like ordering a custom made burger. You'll always be tempted by that little bit extra especially when you're new and uncertain of the gear that you're looking to pick up. Only instead of paying an extra buck for bacon, you're paying like several hundred on something you potentially might not necessarily need.  So make sure you determine your budget and stick to it  If your budget is on the low end, I wouldn't bother micing every drum and cymbal. Intelligently positioned overheads and some basic post-processing can give you a great sound.   Your macbook should be sufficient to record to but you'll need an audio interface. I haven't used it in awhile but I know Audacity is a solid free audio editing and recording software which is probably a good place to start."

drums,3e20hv,XNerd_Bomber,31,Tue Jul 21 10:07:28 2015 UTC,"I heard a great pro once suggest that closing your eyes and air drumming will tell you where you really want things. Pay attention to that. I also completely agree with other here who suggest starting with kick, snare and hihat. Get those feeling good and start adding.  As far as your left foot goes, get those pedals facing you at a natural angle. When you sit with your lower legs perpendicular to the ground, where does your left foot naturally rest? That's where the pedals should be.  Good luck! We all go through this at some point."
drums,3e20hv,greaseleg,3,Tue Jul 21 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"I heard Weckl say that in a clinic - specifically with snare, giving a nice solid stroke towards the snare, and stopping where you feel would be the best stroke. If you stop before you hit the drum, raise it. If you hit the snare before you feel like the stroke is finished comfortably, lower it. Very subjective and different for each individual's posture/positioning, but a very effective way to find the right drum position."
drums,3e20hv,MFLudwig,5,Tue Jul 21 20:20:31 2015 UTC,This should be higher up.
drums,3e20hv,PhascinatingPhysics,10,Tue Jul 21 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"I think ""flattening"" the toms will help alot. Raise them up and then try to make the head of the toms parallel with the floor and move them to the point where they are almost touching each other. Also, it seems you have a gap between the snare drum and the bass drum. Try compacting everything close together and it will be much easier to get to each piece of the set. As for the height of everything, the main solution would be to just raise everything up, including the drum throne."
drums,3e20hv,StonerLlama,7,Tue Jul 21 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"You're going to hear that everything needs to feel comfortable. If it's not comfortable, adjust it. You'll find that changing one thing, e.g., throne height, can affect the way you feel about everything. Having said that, in the second picture, it looks like your hi-hats are a mile away, and in your .gif, you could probably benefit from flattening your toms and bringing them a little closer to you. Just keep messing with it. Change one thing at a time until find the right mix."
drums,3e20hv,LackOfForesight,5,Tue Jul 21 11:14:19 2015 UTC,"I alleviated this problem by taking my kit apart and starting with my hats snare and kick. Set them up how you play best and forget the other drums till you love it. Then, add one tom. Play for a few days like this and get that time where it's meant to be. Then add a cymbal. The whole process took me a week, but now when i set up I know where everything belongs."
drums,3e20hv,Buck_Thunderpumper,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:38 2015 UTC,"If you flatten the toms as others have suggested and still find them too high, maybe take off the second tom and convert to a 4 piece setup. That first tom will be easier to move around. Also noted by others, your snare and hats seem too far from you. Honestly, your gif made me uncomfortable just watching. Really, you need to just make adjustments until you are comfortable."
drums,3e20hv,mykidthinksiamwierd,3,Tue Jul 21 11:24:24 2015 UTC,"Your setup doesn't look so ergonomically unfriendly that it should be drastically hindering your playing. But I agree with others here, you might want to try flattening your toms out quite a bit. Get them as low as you can to the kick or remove them from the bass drum tom mount and put them onto a separate mount just to the left of the kick. I do this with my Silverstar, as well as keep the snare and floor tom relatively flat, and it works great.  http://i.imgur.com/cy3Miz2.jpg"
drums,3e20hv,ANumenorean,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone of course is going to tell you to flatten your toms.    The problem with doing that on a bass drum mounting system is they get farther away from you.  In order to flatten them, they rotate up, so you have to lower them, but then they end up farther away.  That would be fine if you could scoot closer to the drums, but from your gif, you have pretty long legs and are already sitting as close as you reasonably can.  It really sounds to me like you are not used to playing an acoustic kit.  Things are going to be farther apart, especially the toms.    As for setup, if you can get the snare, bass drum, and hi hats in the perfect position, it makes it a lot easier to position everything else.  I'd start by placing the bass drum, then the snare, then the hi hats, then start playing with other things."
drums,3e20hv,Velocicrappper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:48 2015 UTC,One cool thing about the silverstar tom mount is that it can slide forward a few inches to counter that.

drums,3e20hv,Velocicrappper,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"This is what I was told:   start with just your throne. Set it at a height this is comfortable, but your calf/thighs  should be at about a 90-degree angle.  with your sticks, make a motion as if you were aging your snare. Put your snare where your wrist naturally snaps, so that at the height, the stick will hit the center of the head.  put your bass drum where your foot is, and your hats where your other foot is. You'll already be sitting in a place where you want your feet to be, so put your pedals there.  put ride cymbal where you imagine it to be. The air drumming should help with placement. repeat for toms, then other cymbals. Fine tune and adjust as needed."
drums,3e20hv,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:15 2015 UTC,And them end up with something similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1FviJ3wOr4
drums,3e20hv,_Quadro,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"First: you need a new throne.  I think that will fix most of your problem.  There is no ideal height for a throne, some people like to sit really low, some medium height, some really high.  I suspect you fall in that last category.  So you definitely need an adjustable throne to find the perfect height for you.  That will allow you to flatten your toms a bit, like everyone suggest.  The other thing I see from your gif is that you are playing real far from your kit.  Your snare is like 6 to 8 inches away from your kick, and that leave your real far from your rack toms.  Typically, snares are almost touching the kick, or much closer then your actual set up.  Again: if you sit higher, in order to keep the same knee angle (which is I assume the one you find comfortable), you will have to sit closer to your kit.  Sitting hight will also allow you to bring your high hats closer (you should also try bringing them closer to the left rack tom.)   So I would suggest to sit a bit higher and a bit closer to the kit, gradually, until you find the sweet spot for you."
drums,3e20hv,prplx,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:44 2015 UTC,Work on your technique and the setup will matter less.
drums,3e20hv,Jaredgoldmandrums,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"One thing that helped me a buttload with tom positioning was dropping the second bassdrum and buying a lefty double pedal - that means your kick is left of the snare. Voila, you now have loads of room to lower even square toms to a comfortably playable height.  For the rest, take all the time you need to get set up right - if you don't want to invest 100$ in memory clamps i would suggest electrical tape and a sharpie to mark exactly how everything is set up and angled once you get it just right."
drums,3e20hv,SpunkyMcButtlove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:33:59 2015 UTC,Try to flatten out the angle on your toms and them lower and move them closer.  Your high hat looks like its really far away from you.
drums,3e20hv,Vulgrr_Display,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"I would flatten the toms, tilt the snare forward and just move everything closer together. It is, however, a personal thing (I would also get rid of the small rack Tom and the double pedal) so experimentation is the key. It may be worth investing in a more adjustable throne too, so that you can really fine-tune your position."
drums,3e20hv,stevenumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"I've struggled with having a five piece where nothing felt right. To me your snare seems very far away from the bass drum, as well as it looks to be low, and your hi hats also seem to be far away. Everyones style is different so how I would do it is different then how you would do it. Someone else already said this but break your kit down completely and start piece by piece, and move things all around until they are comfortable. To solve the tom problem you could probably get an attachment that would hook your tom mounts to you cymbal stands, that will give you more options on positioning and angles, but youd have to buy it."
drums,3e20hv,ragnorian77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:26 2015 UTC,Asshole here.  Can I suggest you continue to use the google machine to find some pro drummer set ups and set your kit up accordingly? This is a great example of a drum kit that is mostly set up in a sensible way but that hi-hat is definitely positioned for a photo and not for playing. This seems like a reasonable setup and is why 99% of pro drummers will start with this and then supplement or adjust.  Economy of motion really says keep things as close as possible (looking at you hi-hat) and for toms a good rule of thumb is to place your stick flat on the snare and think of being in a sphere. Here is an oversimplified way to look at it and I think it was from Gary Chester. I think your toms are too close and low to have such an angle.  It's great that this is a sharing space and we want to encourage each other but we need some kind of 'best practices' - blind leading the blind is warm and fuzzy but it just ends up being a massive circle jerk. Where is /u/fortydeuce to hopefully weigh in?
drums,3e20hv,jackdaniels05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think all the opinions given here are really valuable - particularly the advice about starting with kick/snare/hats and then adding other stuff once those are comfortable.  But I just want to add another angle: If you watch 10 different drummers, you can see 10 completely different set ups. Some of those will look natural to you while others will look totally crazy. Compare Nicko McBrain's and Igor Cavalera's kits for example; they're both great players but their set ups couldn't be much more different.   Part of it is that they've adjusted things to suit them, but another part is that they've played with their set up and become used to it. My point is that almost any set up, however ""badly"" configured, can be played well by someone who's used to it.  I think there's a potential danger of over-tinkering where you get in a constant cycle of adjusting something, trying it for a couple of minutes, deciding it doesn't work for you and adjusting it again without really giving it the time to bed in. When moving from electric to acoustic, there are bound to be differences to get used to because acoustic drums and cymbals simply take up more space.   The truth is any set up can take a bit of time to get used to, and after a certain point, the time you spend obsessively moving things around by a quarter of an inch, was time you could have spent getting better at playing it the way it was.   I'd recommend trying to start with a fairly neutral set up - probably by following some/all of the suggestions on this thread - and then spend a solid amount of time playing/practising with it. If anything still feels unnatural try and assess whether it's something that could be fixed by changing the position/height/rotation of some hardware, or whether you just need to think up an exercise that addresses that discomfort through practice."
drums,3e20hv,serpent_tim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"All you need is good hardware that can incrementally adjust the positioning of every piece of your kit independently. This way you can move everything around as you practice until it's just right. Upgrade in this order: throne, rack tom mounting, kick pedal, snare stand, hi hat stand."
drums,3e20hv,wun_drop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"1 - Height, you might try lowering your throne height just a little- I find it most comfortable when my legs are bent at an angle of just over 90 degrees. Playing heel up I find the closer to 90 degrees my legs are bent the more efficient, fluid, and natural that feeling is. Sit and place the ball of your foot on the ground and bounce your leg in different positions until you find what's most comfortable- I bet you'll find the same.  2 - Pedal placement, put your feet at shoulder width apart facing straight ahead and then rotate the left foot about 45 degrees, that's what I always recommend as a starting place. Depending on the length of your legs/width of your shoulders this will change. You don't look particularly lanky or anything so start by placing your hat and bass pedals here and micro-adjust until you get everything into a position that you feel natural and fluid in.  3 - Snare height - the snare should be between your legs sitting right up next to the bass drum. /u/greaseleg 's tip of air drumming to find the right height is righteous. Make sure it's not so high that you can't rimshot and not so low that you're smacking your thighs on the way down. Finally you want to start with the snare flat, you can angle it ever so slightly towards/away from you but for best results get that sucker as flat as Kansas. This will ensure your sticks are rebounding in the right direction and lets you hit solid rimshots.  4 - Floor tom- after you have your snare and hat set comfortably the floor tom is easy. Line up your floor tom so that it makes a straight line with your snare and hats and raise/lower it to 0.5"" to 1"" lower than your snare. I prefer mine flat but some will angle it towards them slightly- that's just preference.   5 - Rack toms- These will be harder to position for you since you're currently mounting them from the bass drum, but it should be doable. You want them as flat as possible (again with the rebounding) but low enough that you're not hitting the rims. Play with the angles and positions here to find what feels best to you. Keep an eye out for hardware with tom mounts. I like cymbal stands with mounting arms built in best (less hardware=less to load in/out). This will give you more freedom to move stuff around.   6 - Change it up even after you find a set up you like. Move your rack toms, switch up your cymbals, whatever! If you see something different online try to set up like it, you never know you might find something you like even better! Just remember the goal is fluid, ergonomic movement. Keep everything tight and comfy, never put anything where you have to stretch to hit it."

drums,3e3r98,Smokey_Jah,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"As an example, a Yamaha Stage Custom is a fantastic mid-level kit that costs $650 new.  Buying hardware, cymbals, a throne and other misc bits will push you over 1k so the best thing you can do is Craigslist!   Find a solid mid level Yamaha,  Mapex, Ludwig, Pearl or Sonar shell pack there,  probably around 400.  You might able to score a deal and grab a bunch of extras with it for maybe 650 to 800.  Next,  get hi hats and stand.   Decent used HH are prob 150.  Stand 50 to 100.  Crash and ride are next, find a deal for both if possible.  Stay away from the beginning lines - ZBT, B8, etc.   It's worth it for some extra upfront cost.  I'd say ride more important at first, so maybe spend more on that first.  Prices start at about 100.  Pick up some cheap stands for ride and crash.   Prob about 25 each.   The most important part?   The throne.   I love Roc N Soc thrones but sit on a bunch at a store and find one you like.  I'd recommend buying new just cuz its hard to really find a deal on a throne but DONT CHEAP ON THIS!   If you're uncomfortable sitting, you won't enjoy playing. New around 100.  After that, sticks, brushes, moongel, and maybe a good book like Groove Essentials for total of 60.  Kit - 400 HH cymbals - 150 Stands - 150 Crash and ride - 200 Throne - 100 Sticks, etc - 60  Total: 1060  So you can see what it's gonna take and will be higher or lower depending on if you get a deal.

drums,3e3s8o,TylerPowers,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"Some interesting and creative grooves and solid footwork! Well done.  As you've welcomed criticism in your post title I'm gonna break down some things that I noticed.  Continue to work on your hand technique and try to correct that grip! From the looks of things it appears that your sticks may be too loose as they appear to be flying around in an uncontrolled manner on the rebound. Improving on your hand technique will drastically improve your overall ability.   Adding in some more dynamics would do wonders for your groove. Try to play through rudiments and select accents on certain strokes while ghosting others. This is a particularly valuable skill for your left hand as that is what you'll use to ghost the snare most of the time but obviously practice with both your hands  Your time keeping is alittle weak and you have a tendency to shift time when you're playing fills. With continued practice with a metronome you'll improve but time keeping is a skill that develops gradually.  Just like the rest of us, we've all got plenty of things to work on but these are the most obvious things that I think working on will benefit you the most.   Keep up the good work!"

The wingnut was not returned, and by the time it gets to my car, all the felt has fallen off, and they had no clue.

Most of the time they're off to the side of the stage pretending they're important. (Kidding.)  Then there's the drummer. The greatest fucking guy in the band. He takes care of everyone, makes sure they're not fucking up--tells them the key that we're in, cue's everyone in.

I wish I could push a button and it would zap all the gear into a pocket-sized device.  Get to the gig, push the button and it zaps it all back out again, perfectly set up.    Also, I agree with OP about tuning. Tuning drums well is so hard to learn.  And not only is it difficult, but you have to carefully tune every drum, often in some relationship to one another.  I swear I get tuning anxiety every time I have to replace a head."
drums,3e0nay,Yeast000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:50 2015 UTC,"Am I the one who doesn't have an issue with tuning?  Maybe I'm just a natural at it.  You don't have to do it anywhere near as much as guitarists (and if you do, you need new heads or new bearing edges, or you have warped shells)."

drums,3e28uz,TheDaveMeowthews,3,Tue Jul 21 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say it but drumming really won't be a practical means of weight loss. Drumming can definitely get you nice and warmed up and can help you increase endurance in small muscle groups (think wrists and fingers).  However overall, there's just not enough large compound movement to sufficiently raise your heart rate to a point where you'd get a real cardiovascular workout.   Don't get me wrong, drumming can certainly help to improve your physical conditioning but it will not achieve weight loss in the same way that say, going for a run or a swim will.  Not even close."
drums,3e28uz,Yeast000,5,Tue Jul 21 19:02:35 2015 UTC,Close all possible points of ventilation.   Take off shirt.   Practice non stop 16th note fills at 200 bpm.   ???  Profit.
drums,3e28uz,snipepe,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well you could do sit ups and push ups in between songs. Personally, I don't even get remotely close to anything resembling exercise when I am playing. If you are looking to drop 50-60 pounds, speaking from experience, the only thing that is going to do it is to do some extreme changes to your diet. You not only have to cut back to what you should be eating, but further than that to actually lose weight. If you have a 500 calorie deficit per day, that is 3500 calories you lose per week. That is 1 pound of fat per week. You could lose all of that weight in a year or so. And that is about as fast as is reasonably possible. You could play drums literally all day long, and it would not make up the difference of drinking a big coke or not drinking one."
drums,3e28uz,DudeWheresMyRhino,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:48 2015 UTC,The only way I can see is to play some pretty uptempo songs for long periods of time.  But if you're just learning you may not have the chops to do that just yet.  I recommend both exercise and drumming.  I work out and lift weights regularly and usually drum afterward when I get home from the gym.  I find I'm already warm from the gym and can move around the kit better and with more energy too.  I wouldn't rely solely on drumming if you're trying to lose weight.
drums,3e28uz,fastballer8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:52 2015 UTC,Well... I can say I lost 20 kg by just drumming and changing my diet.
drums,3e28uz,_Quadro,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:31 2015 UTC,You made a very important point and that's the diet.  Exercising by doing cardio alone and not changing your diet won't have the same effects as a change in diet.  I don't really think drumming by itself gives you a high enough cardio workout for it to be really effective at weight loss without the addition of a change in diet.  Congrats on the weight loss!

drums,3e28uz,abacacus,3,Tue Jul 21 12:05:28 2015 UTC,"You'd get a better workout going for a run or swimming or going to the gym or something - it's good exercise and fun but I wouldn't rely on it to lose weight. Better diet would help most with that anyway - have you got MyFitnessPal? That's a great app, helped me lose 100lb a while back."
drums,3e0jrz,wolf_biker,5,Tue Jul 21 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"The sound absolutely gets choked when you put any drum on a snare stand if you tighten the basket claws way down on the bottom hoop. I never have my snare tight in the stand, and this is my preferred method of mounting a rack tom. Clamping it on a cymbal stand helps your bass drum resonate better too!"
drums,3e0jrz,stack_percussion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience it's just this drum. I never over tightened the claws on the bottom hoop. Other kits I've had, or played, never had this problem. It just seems really strange. But oh well. Problem solved."
drums,3e0jrz,Citytown,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:31 2015 UTC,"It isn't that drum, it's all drums. You don't have to tighten the claws to kill the resonance. The same thing will happen to your floor tom and you can observe this if you pick it up off the ground and strike the head.  The issue is that the sustain/resonance rings through the shell and if you rest parts of the shell on a surface, those points of impact transfer the resonance to whatever it is sitting on.  A way to combat this is to tune your drums so that the reso and batter heads ring together for the longest possible time when suspended. When you drop it on a stand then it will ring a little bit longer.   All in all, there are many factors that affect the tone and sustain of your drums. Type of wood, combination of heads, tuning, harware, temperature, etc. Your challenge will be to use the right combination  of all these factors to get the drum sound you want."

We dig the Fleetwood Mac ""rumors"" drum sound, so we tried similar tactics. We put towed and blanks over the heads of the toms and tightened the rims over the towel & head combo. For the snare, we threw a towel over it to get and even more muffled deep & fat sound.  This track, ""Perfect"" by Black Suns, was recorded in February 2015 after months of writing. We recorded to a click (153 bpm) and did per instrument tracking.   I setup a camera, in hopes to capture a short video to post on instagram, but instead captured the entire take, which we ended up using for the song."

drums,3e0eu3,DontClapOn1and3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:09 2015 UTC,Non-drummer lurker here... is that cymbal broken in the bottom-right? Is that intentional?
drums,3e0eu3,Rhydderch7734,2,Tue Jul 21 07:01:18 2015 UTC,"It is broken, and most likely it isn't intentional. Sometimes cymbals break, I mean they're thin metal disks being smashed with sticks repeatedly. Some drummers trash them, but a break does give the cymbal an interesting sound so some people like them."
drums,3e0eu3,NikonNevzorov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:41:04 2015 UTC,I had an idea it was something along those lines.  Thank you for the response.
drums,3e0eu3,Rhydderch7734,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:12 2015 UTC,What's that on the walls? I guess its for soundproofing? Any good? I'm getting a new house soon and wanting to reduce the sound in a room as much as i can on the cheap. I understand that real soundproofing is expensive!
drums,3e1rbn,TehNewDrummer,4,Tue Jul 21 08:00:02 2015 UTC,I have spent $800 USD on a 13x7.5 Mappa Bubbinga snare by Sakae Drums. I love it so much and it is a long term investment. It sounds like a snare after producing without any EQ.
drums,3e1rbn,snipepe,3,Tue Jul 21 09:11:34 2015 UTC,"The drum in question is a Dunnett 14x6.5 Stainless Steel.   I bought it for the sound, plain and simple. It's easy to spend hundreds on eye candy like finishes and veneers for what is otherwise a $500 drum, but the Dunnett is so simple that all it has left is the sound, and it still sounded better than $1000+ drums. It's REALLY clean, sonically (next to no nasty overtones), has tons of body at every tuning I've tried thus far, and has a pleasant balance of warmth and aggression.   How did I justify it though? The drum had a proven track record: it's a studio favorite, it's flexible, and the build quality is second to none. It's my desert island drum, and one that I'll have the rest of my life. $700 for a drum I won't just own, but love to own and love to share and love to play, for decades? How could you not?"
drums,3e1rbn,DarkNostril,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"Once you have a really nice snare that responds to your every snare whim and completes your playing style, and engineers and bass players and other drummers go ""whoa, that snare sounds amazing!"", you'll understand."

drums,3e1rbn,ryanverse,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"For me, the snare is MY sound. I went through so many good snares before I bought my favourite snare last week. It's the cornerstone of the drum kit, and its sound defines each drummer individually. If my kit sounds bad to some people, at least my snare certainly won't."

drums,3e1okg,steverocksvh,2,Tue Jul 21 07:52:01 2015 UTC,"For someone who actually uses a hardware bag fairly regularly, you're going to get between 12-36 months out of an under-$100 hardware bag. A strap will fail, the walls will begin to shred, the reinforcement will crack, something will give out.   Get something good from the outset. SKB makes excellent hard cases for hardware, but as an owner I will tell you that they're very awkward to carry around loaded because of how much the case itself weighs to begin with. But, you can stack stuff on top of it and don't have to worry about anything puncturing or wearing through a soft bag wall.  The Ahead Ogio sleds are fantastic. Relatively lightweight, flexible, and well built.  The Gator HDWE-1436 is the best inexpensive option. If you have a bigger throne seat, opt for the HDWE-1846. Similar concept to the Ogio, it has a rigid bottom section with a soft upper."

drums,3e1okg,_Quadro,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"The bottom is very sturdy - on the outside it's a durable rubber designed to be dragged up curbs and stairs, and then a strong metal skeleton (I'm assuming tubes). Inside there's a layer of padded nylon.  All of the walls are padded, and the roof holds its convex shape to give you more interior room if you need it. There's more space inside this thing than any hardware case I've ever seen, and the fact that it's ""soft"" gives you a little bit of flex if you need it.

drums,3e0imx,steverocksvh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:53 2015 UTC,"There are few reasons why it would matter.  Unless the sound were uniquely made by an instrument made by one company, I'd bet nobody can listen to music and ID the brand of the instruments, especially now when anything old cymbal can be mixed to sound like anything.  Yes, certain ""lines"" are made to have certain similar sound profiles, but since the sound of things change over time and in different environments, mixes, takes, etc., the best thing to do if you're not sponsored is to close your eyes and use your ears--what music is for--at the drum shop when buying things. Candid, in-studio pictures of drummers with sponsorships often reveal that they use many different types and brands of things that they don't use in public (shhh!). When top drummers switch sponsors, they'll ofen make the new sponsor make their version of things so that all they're really changing is the logo (and their paychecks).  Brand-loyalty is 99% bullshit."

He asked where I bought I from and told him it was musicians friend, then he switched the legs and told me they were put on backwards. I literally had no words.

What helped me was playing Oildale (Leave me alone) by Korn. It also helped me break free from wanted to only play the kick on the up beat.  The main part I am talking about is when the song comes in. It is fairly simple to play. It just goes against what we naturally want to do, which Ray Luzier is great at doing.  The first down beat, you hit the floor tom and main crash. The first up beat, you hit the kick. Repeat this.   It should go like... tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick:  This is where the hard part is. After you play that kick, instead of going tom/crash, hit the crash and two snare hits with your right hand, then repeat that.  It should go as follows:  tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick: snarex2/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: kick: tom/crash: snarex2/crash  This helped me, and I hope you can actually understand that, because it helped me."
drums,3e0kz6,mr-president95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"Whenever you're learning a new beat or groove, it's extremely helpful to go SUPER slowly. It gives your brain space to process the new pattern and learn what it's supposed to feel like. I mean SUPER slowly. Note by note, if necessary. Practice getting it perfect at your slow tempo. Then speed it up a little bit.  To really break it down, I like to practice only two limbs at a time. So, I would do: right hand & right foot. Then right hand & and left hand. Then right foot and left foot. Then left hand and left foot. Finally, you slowly put them together, maybe three at a time. Switch up which ones you use until you're fairly comfortable. Then try it all together (slowly).  This method has worked for me as I work on more complex rhythms and as I put drum rudiments over foot patterns. There's always more to learn, and this has gotten me a long way so far.  I'm sure you can reach whatever goal you set for yourself! It just takes practice and patience."

drums,3dxukr,indoninjah,8,Mon Jul 20 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"Any drunmer can throw out rolls and fills but a musician listens and adapts. Being a bass player im pretty sure that you would understand that music isnt about you and more about the band.   Remember that a drummer keeps the beat and adds weight to the music. Its all about supporting the band. Flashy stuff can wait, learn the dynamics. A simple beat can sound amazing when voiced correctly."

drums,3dxukr,the_BirdBot,3,Mon Jul 20 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"As a guitar player, turned drummer, I would say that being a musician who plays drums gives you an advantage over a lot of instrumentalists. It's all about what the song needs. Also , the bass is what you need to interact with most and you know all about that."
drums,3dxukr,stevenumb,2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"I would actually say think like a bass/guitar player- when you're playing what's most important to you? My guess would be time and being able to follow the beat.  The most important thing is time- for sure. You have to keep good time but you want the other players to feel comfortable enough with what's going on.  The more flash and detail you throw into your playing the more difficult it may be for others to get into the groove.  TLDR: Keep time, keep it simple, be supportive of the other playing.  Also, props on going the extra mile for your club! Rock on!"
drums,3dxukr,big_floppy,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"There's a whole bunch of people here saying that something along the lines of ""groove first, flash second"" which is absolutely true and good but I don't think it's specific enough to be useful.   Since you're playing rock music, an important thing to think about is exactly why you're playing every individual note and what purpose that note serves. Why are you placing your back-beat on 3 instead of 2 and 4? Why are you placing your bass drum on beat 4? Is it to synchronize with an important note in the  bass part? Maybe you decide to play eight notes on the hi hat so that the guitar player can subdivide their dotted eight note rhythms easier. Maybe you decide to ride lightly on a crash for an ethereal sounding chorus. Drums are great because you have so many options, but that can also be their greatest difficulty for people starting out, so its always important to make sure that, above all else, It FEELS good. That being said there is a logic behind it, so I would recommend listening to music you enjoy and paying attention to how the drums lock in with the rest of the song. hope this helps."
drums,3dxukr,Phish_Like_Fish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:39 2015 UTC,"groove first, flash second. only use fills when there's space between differentiating sections. what you do, you do to support the band. be insanely keen on your dynamics. play in layers -- start a groove with closed hi hats, then as the intensity rises, open/close, then the next level up all open hi hats, then when you're peaking, crash on a ride or a china. know when NOT to play. listen to EVERYONE around you.   and most of all, don't try to copy and play back to people what they're playing. establish your groove, make it work underneath the rest of the band, and feel them respond to your pulse.  have fun!"

Drummers almost universally speed up if they're not paying attention.  Do you practice with a metronome? It should be your new best friend."

But you run into a lot of brand loyalty/people showing a lack of variety because many times cymbals from the same line are made to complement each other very well. It's less searching to find the cymbal that pairs with what you've already got if you're looking within the same company and within the same line than if you're going external and trying to match a Meinl with a Sabian.

drums,3dy999,fastballer8,4,Mon Jul 20 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"how do you actually develop good timing that way as opposed. to just following it and letting it keep you in time?    Following it and letting it keep you in time is exactly what develops your good timing.  Your progress is something you're not going to notice until somebody else points it out to you.  The more you play with a click, the more you will internalize even spacing and tempo.  One thing you do is stop thinking about the click like God, and start thinking about it like another guy playing a really boring instrument who still wants to jam with you.  All he knows how to play is ""BING BING BING BING"" but he does it with perfect timing and you need to learn how to move around it and do your thing.  Maybe a stupid way to think but I find it amusing and helpful."

drums,3dy999,lonestarpercussion,4,Mon Jul 20 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"A metronome is a powerful tool, but relying too much on it can actually become a crutch.  Once you feel comfortable playing something at a certain tempo, take the metronome down to half that speed; if a song is at bpm=120, move it down to 60.   Do this and the 'click' will only sound on beats 1 and 3 (or 2 and 4 if you'd rather it give you backbeats). Greater space in between each click means more room for error on your part, so you can better evaluate if you're rushing, dragging, or right on the money.   You can do it again if your met goes low enough, giving you one click a measure. If you can stay in time with a metronome with that much space, your timing is solid."

drums,3dy999,themasecar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"The best way to improve time I've yet found is something I took from Dave DiCenso's books: Subdivide and count aloud while you're playing, loud enough that you can hear yourself counting. Project your voice; it turns into a sort of combined breathing exercise, too.  Turn on the metronome to, say, 80bpm, then start counting sixteenth notes. 1-e-&-a 2-e-&-a, etc. Don't even think about starting to play anything yet; this is about time, remember? Now sing it louder!   Now clap quarter notes for at least sixteen bars while continuing to sing the subdivision, 1-e-&-a 2-e-&-a, etc. Then eighth notes for sixteen bars. Then break up quarters and eighths into various rhythms, still singing that sixteenth note subdivision.  Now flip it. Clap quarters, eighths, and sixteenths while subdividing with your voice. Say it's a quarter followed by two eighth notes, your voice should accent those notes: ONE-e-&-a TWO-e-AND-a THREE-e-&-a FOUR-e-AND-a, etc.  This gets the time out of your hands and into your head.  Now, keep singing that subdivision and play those patterns with drumsticks. Then play some grooves while counting. If you're good at it, you eventually won't need a metronome, but the metronome is there to keep your time steady, so I recommend it.  And yes, you'll probably hate this at first, but if my ten-year-old students can get it, so can you."

You can play a basic groove on the cajon with one hand while using the other to play shakers or hit other instruments like cowbells and bongos.  You can change up the color of your cajon somewhat by playing on it with brushes.  There's a ton of small instruments out there designed to attach directly to your cajon and are playable with your hands, giving you more colors."

I reached a point a few months ago where I couldn't take it anymore.  My ass hurt from the lack of cushioning, my back hurt from the angle I sat at, and I knew that it was hurting my playing too.     Bought a new throne finally, and it made more difference in my playing than any new cymbal or drum could.  I brought the height up a few inches and instantly felt a difference.  My angles were proper, my back felt better because I finally had a correct posture, and my ass felt like it was sitting on top of a marshmallow cloud.    If you're just starting out, maybe don't drop $150 on something right away, but if you start getting serious, it's worth the investment."

drums,3dybgy,FormidableDrummer,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"I think you definitely want a throne because of the range of motion flexibility you'll need, but it doesn't need to be super feature rich out of the gate.

There were sections where I'd be playing on the hi-hat, transition directly to some xylophone licks, then go up to the toms. Wouldn't have been able to facilitate a lot of the playing without the Kat. To answer your question, I find that I can't be as musical when playing the Kat (so I wouldn't use it for solo/chamber playing), but it sounds great, is compact in size, and gets the job done (I use it mostly for musicals)."

The hoops I will try steel wool before having to resort to grinding. Either way all the hardware will be powder coated gold. I'm going to strip the wrap and sand and stain it a dark color. I haven't decided which shade. I dislike toms mounted to the bass drum so I will likely remove all that hardware and figure a way to seal the hole. I plan on completely changing the mounting system for the drums. I just got it today and it's going to be a looonnnng project. I'm not worried about playing it right away. I play on my cousins set and he's right down the road. I haven't decided everything I want to do, but I'm looking forward to figuring it out :)"
drums,3dw4qz,TheDrumHQ,3,Mon Jul 20 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"I lost my kit in my moms house fire January 1st 2014 and couldn't afford to replace it. I had spent years making it perfectly mine. Today I picked this Pearl Forum kit up for $150. It needs a lot of love, but I have time and it will be awesome when done!"
drums,3dw4qz,hztr,3,Mon Jul 20 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"With some love and fresh skins, that kit will sound really cool. For a while when I was between kits, I would rent a drum kit that you can buy (with cymbals) for $350... new, but I convinced the music store to put good skins on it, and even with the cymbals that came with, they can sound really cool. The CX300 cymbals that came with the forums, even though they're brass, have this cool dry quality.   Also, might wanna try some CLR on the rust. It should break down rust nicely so you might not have to use abrasives. Besides, when you resort to grinding something like a hoop, you're adding weak spots into the metal. Triple flange hoops already have a lot of flex, but grinding could lead to tuning issues later. Just a thought.   Lastly, I'm only adding this because it hasn't come up yet, if you're powder coating all the hardware, don't coat the tension rods. They'll have issues threading (in every case I've seen so far) and at the moment, most sites (edit: if you end up needing to buy new hardware) will have chrome, brass, black, or gold. Although I'm talking with a friend who started a drum company and he might look into making coloured (as in any colour) tension rods without doing it as a coating. I think that could be sweet if he pulls it off. Anyway, luck with the project. Cheers.  (edit: PS: drumfactorydirect.com is a nice place to start for picking up all sorts of random parts... even some brand specific stuff. I've used them a bunch and they're great.)"

drums,3dujjb,WyattWilliams,12,Sun Jul 19 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/UselessGadget. However I think there are some other things you ought to know in the case of a customer looking for a particular sound but doesn't necessarily know what the options are.  Generally with cymbals, there are a couple factors that people look for:  Bright Tones (generally good for most rock and metal):    - Sabian AA & AAX are the most common from that brand    - Zildjian A lines    - Meinl Byzance brilliant, traditional and others.  Dark tones (generally more suitable for jazz, fusion etc):     - Sabian HH & HHX lines     - Zildjian K lines    - Meinl Dark Byzance Vintage, Extra dry series etc.  Thinner cymbals tend to sound ""trashier"" and have a quicker decay, but thicker cymbals tend to be more ""cutting"" and project more significantly rather than mixing in with the rest of the sounds from the kit. To get a good idea of how the cymbals work look at the meinl cymbal finder thing on their website and listen to the various sounds of the different types of cymbals. Mycymbal.com is another great resource for this.  Heads:  Learn the way single and double ply heads and the thickness of the plies affect the sound. Evans has a decent chart layout on their website to get a start on this understanding.   Ultimately you ought to do a lot of the research yourself to get it burned into your memory. Always remember that there is not ""best"" cymbal or head, but there may be a ""best for X"" that you ought to understand. This info should be a good starting point. Another thing to do to learn how to sell is start playing more. If you're allowed while at work, play around on the kits and cymbals a bit. Knowing what you like and getting a tangible experience with the different products will help your understanding immensely.   Best of luck!"
drums,3dujjb,thecrsinger,31,Sun Jul 19 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Ignore it.  Find out which items have the biggest profit margins.  Sell those items.  You need to convince the shopper that they sound the best.  If a user has done their research, they will know what the want.  But you'll be an allstar at your job if you bring in more money.  edit: a lot of people have a problem with the above.  So let me add to it and probably polarize more, or explain myself better:  It's sales first, customer service second.  In sales, you will say what you think will work to get the customer to buy said product, though you don't lie.  There is a certain level of caring for the customer you have to provide but ultimately, you are looking for the commission for yourself and getting the sale for the company.    Example:  I walk into the store and want specifically Vic Firth 5As because that is the stick that I use after having tried most other brands sticks.  I tell the sales person this.  At that point it's ""Sure sir, they are right over here.  But, have you tried this other brand here?""  Knowing they have a better profit margin, perhaps he can get me to buy.  Continue on with ""They are a little bit cheaper and feel about the same.  I've used both and can't tell a difference.""  Honestly, I might look at the price, grab a pair and tap on a pad and at that point decide to switch, or not.  If I do, the sales person gets a larger profit margin and I may have found a new brand to use.  Example2:  Customer walks in looking for drum heads.  The describe the sound they are looking for as that nice thudy rock sound.  I think the best options would be Remo Pinstripes top/Ambassador bottom, Evans Ec2 top/G1 bottom or Aquarian Performance II top/High Frequency bottom.  (I may be wrong in this comparison, if I am, help me out) All three are pretty equal as dual ply top with an internal ring and a single ply bottom.  They will all be very similar in sound if tuned to be.  So which do you sell?  The one with the highest profit margin!"

drums,3dujjb,steverocksvh,9,Sun Jul 19 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Good for the owner, not the client.  I use to go to this drum shop and like one guy who was very knowledgeable but also saved me tons of money.  For example, I would never get my kick pedal to feel decent, I just gave up tinkering with it and went to see him to buy a new one.  Money is not a problem, I was looking dw, Pearl, etc.  He told me to bring my old pedal before I splurge on a new one, so he could have a look at it.  I did.  After 2 minutes, he points out that the spring that was installed (I bought it used) was totally the wrong spring for that pedal.  He changed it, I tried it and it was perfectly fine with me.  Cost me $1.50.  One day I realized he had moved to another shop, and I took my business there.  I bought for 1000$ of dollar of drum stuff from his shop.  I always go see him because I trust him."
drums,3dujjb,prplx,6,Sun Jul 19 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"This is the best example of how to be a good salesman. Be kind. Take an interest in your customers. Listen to them. Don't just try to sell them shit all the time. If they have a problem with existing equipment, try to fix it before you suggest they purchase a replacement. Loyal customers will make you more money in the long run. Sure there will be people buying gifts for musicians that don't really know what they're looking for but if you treat them the same as loyal customers, they'll either come back or refer whoever the gift is for back to you.  And yes, research your products."
drums,3dujjb,ChipsDestroyer,3,Sun Jul 19 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on the owner and their strategy. This mindset is focused on short term gains and singular transactions.

drums,3dujjb,GreenbrierMusic,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"This is a great example and counter argument.  However, I wonder if the guy had to change stores because he was fired for selling you a $1.50 part instead of a $150 new pedal.  I'd much rather stay employed first, help the customer second.  Sometimes, providing the best customer is the best way to stay employed, sometimes it isn't.  It's an unfortunate fact."

I don't think you are going to get a mom coming in saying their son joined 7th grade band and needs the ""driest"" snare.  You are going to sell them the snare with the best profit margin in the lowest price range of snares you have available.  Sure, simple facts like mentioned below of ""a thinner cymbal is trashier"" is true, but that's small irrelevent details most of the time.  Someone looking for a trashy or pingy or washy or whatever cymbal is going to go in the cymbal room and start hitting cymbals to find the one they like... if they haven't already scoured youtube listening to cymbal profiles."

If you work for GC, you should do what this guy suggests, it's the only way you have a shot at making a living wage. But if your company is more of like a Sam Ash or smaller, you may want to be real with people and actually create good relationships and value with your interactions."

drums,3dujjb,Iamametameta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, there are only a few large retail chains in the industry in the US anymore. GC/Sam Ash/Five Star Drums (which is more of a consortium of smaller stores). Really, the only one of these companies who can afford to practice these tactics is GC. Even #2 and smaller have to be better stores. Dealing with artists and creators is just not the same as WalMart style retail.  The saddest thing is that GC gets like 95% of first time entrants into the market, so they're salting the earth for the future of real music with this stuff."
drums,3dujjb,GreenbrierMusic,2,Sun Jul 19 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"Ignore it.   Terrible advice. As someone working in a music store, this person definitely needs to know about the different sounds, woods, etc available. A knowledgeable store person will have more returning happy customers in the long term.   The people who know EXACTLY what they want are usually the people who will spend more money (especially long term), as they're more experienced and are not just looking for the cheap beginner kit/cymbal/whatever. The problem with your ""customer comes second"" approach is that the experienced drummers are gonna smell bullshit a mile away, as they know more about the products you're trying to sell, so with these people you need to know the products inside out, rather than just ""ignoring it"".  If I walk into a store and can have a good conversation with the customer service worker about what I'm purchasing, if I can tell they actually know what they're talking about, and most importantly if they care about me, the customer, I'm gonna return there and spend more money. If I walk into a store and I sense the worker is just trying to push me towards what they want me to buy, I will walk out and spend my money elsewhere."
drums,3dujjb,mereddits,3,Sun Jul 19 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'll go ahead and take up the opposite mindset of what seems to be most popular here. You don't have to be a sales robot to keep your job at these places, and knowing how GC restructured pay last year, commission is no longer enough to justify selling a product for its margins. Especially in drums. I managed to keep a job for a year and could have kept going had I not moved, I built up some great relations with folks that shopped there, and that's because I was honest with them. You want to know more about what you're selling so you can help your customers better? Good for you. More people in big box stores need your mindset. If there were more people that actually cared enough about their fellow musician to be honest with them, I'd still be shopping at big box stores and you wouldn't see sporadic comments everywhere about how much they suck because the employees are steering you in the wrong direction just to make at the very most, 3% commission. (It's much less 99% of the time.)   Check the manufacture's sites, read up on products. You have a computer there, and you'll probably have a good bit of downtime. You can spend that endlessly rearranging your department (I don't know why, but when I worked here they had this sick obsession with changing things to keep us all busy and the store looking fresh when all it did was confuse the shit out of my customers) or you can hop on your terminal and say ""alright, I'm going to check out snares today."" You can see your stock, and that is not even half of what is out there. Check your used section and you'll find some things that your store has never sold new. It helps to learn all of that so when someone comes in looking to sell something you've never seen, you're in a better spot to help them or give them a quote. Believe it or not, you can even be honest about buy ins. Be upfront with people and let them know that you're taking their gear at 50% of what it will sell for when they could get close to 70% of the new price by taking the time to sell it on their own if it's in good shape. Most people will still let you buy in their gear after telling them that, and they won't feel blindsided when they come back for sticks next week and see just how much profit you're making off of them. They'll trust you, and if you build up trust, you'll get by just as well as anyone that claims the only way to make it in a retail music store is by putting yourself before the customer.

By the end of the verse, heading into the chorus, you drop close to 10bpm.   If you don't, get a metronome app and practice with it. Start on a pad, and just work eight on a hand back and forth (one bar of eighth notes per hand), starting nice and slow. Move the tempo up only 5bpm once every two or three minutes. Eventually you'll get to a point where your stamina drags you down after three or four passes: back the tempo back down and stay there for a while.   Then, take it to the kit, doing the same thing. Start slow.   The trick is to be right on top of the beat. Don't rush, don't drag."

drums,3dv4c7,center24tp,4,Mon Jul 20 21:22:54 2015 UTC,"Dude you got enough style and chops to ""over-decorate"" if you want, and you play tastefully enough to pull it off. I understand you're trying to make a name for yourself as a YT drummer, but that won't happen here, posting Bruno Mars and other pop song covers (nothing wrong with it, this just probably isn't the most receptive forum for it). I'd take it to a sub where it's less musician focused and more about the users enjoying the original material. You'll have a greater chance of increasing your subscriber base that way, a la Cooperdrummer. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing you take a crack at like A Mars Volta or Porcupine Tree cover, even QOTSA....something like that. Those kinds of covers get more love around here it seems. Just my 2 cents."

We're not all that pretentious that just because it's popular that automatically means it's not good musicianship, especially when talking about Bruno Mars. Either way I thought it was tasteful and overall style appropriate for the song."
drums,3dv4c7,center24tp,3,Sun Jul 19 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"I mean you won't get as much love posting Bruno Mars covers as you would AAL covers. Simple as that. A lot of drum snobs on here (shit I'm one of them) but I like what the kid's doing regardless, I'm just throwing out suggestions for him to build an audience in whatever avenue he chooses."
drums,3dv4c7,theothernameplate,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:29 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Bruno Mars is probably one of the best pop artists out! He's some pretty funky stuff.. Well thank you! Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Much appreciated.
drums,3dvj5c,ShadowOfLight2224,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"Serial number puts it in the 1978-1979 range.  I would guess it is part of a Quadra-Plus or Octo-Plus Concert Tom set.  Edit:  Seeing the mention of acrylic shells, I will change my answer to 78/79 Vistalites...the were made in a solid black as well as transparent versions."
drums,3dvj5c,JoeMagnifico,3,Sun Jul 19 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"It's a Vistalite. Black acrylic shells (they also made a translucent black, called ""smoke""). I don't know if that configuration had a name, it may have. 78-79 is kind of late for a kit with concert toms, their popularity was waning by then.  The T-rods look original but not the claws. The kick drum hoops are not original. It likely would have had black wood ones with silver sparkle inlays.  Nice kit, all in all. Ludwig had production runs of these and they made a lot of them, but they would make basically anything else they offered out of acrylic too upon special order, i.e. thrones, bongos, conical conga drums, etc. But all their acrylic drums were top shelf quality.   If you ever have to take lug casings off for any reason, be very careful not to over-tighten the backing screws when you put them back on. The acrylic shells will crack under pressure."
drums,3dvj5c,infiniteninjas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"Looks like a Vistalite to me, unless that name was given only to the translucent shells. But that is a fiberglass (acrylic?) shell isn't it?"

I'm just unsure if the Vistalite name was only given to the shells you can see through, but I don't think that's the case. I think that is a Vistalite kit, even though it isn't one of the 'see through' kits."

drums,3dwo9c,GUITARVADER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"It's a ten day tour with no trailer. 5 members in the band, we might have to consolidate all of our gear into 2 cars, maybe 3. I have a Yamaha stage custom 4 piece, with a ride, a crash, and hi hats. I have a cymbal case, but no cases for hardware or drums."
drums,3dwo9c,GUITARVADER,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"I am assuming you aren't making money on this tour. If you have money to burn the main thing that will make your life easier is a hardware bag with wheels. Aside from that I don't think there is any gear worth buying since there won't be a return on the investment. When you pack your drums try flipping the floor tom upside down, then putting the snare and rack tom on top of the floor tom reso head, then turning the floor tom legs so they lock against the rack tom and hold everything together. That way one person can move the toms and snare easily as one package. When space is at a premium I've noticed that one person usually becomes the designated loader. This is a good thing because they can be a last check that everything is loaded and they will improve the efficiency of loading as they get practice. Take out the rod from your hi-hat stand when packing it. It is less likely to get bent but it will still probably get bent."

I went in with a drumset faculty member and he had me play a few different feels, grooves, and I also had to read from a sheet of hip hop drumming and play along to that. It can really vary for everybody and with what ensemble you are trying to audition for, mine was just a more general thing to see where I would get placed.  Also, there are 3 levels of ensembles at Columbia. Styles, Performance, and Showcase. Styles is kind of just getting your foot in the door and you have a performance at the end of the semester and it's a lot of fun. Performance you have (obviously) more performances and then Showcase is the real top of the line, intensive stuff. Good luck dude!"

Granted, we don't focus on modules, but we are constantly offering our kits with other brands of modules, etc.  If you had a bad experience with our product, then I would love to hear what it was.  I am constantly doing whatever I can to make our company better - including product improvements :)"

drums,3dv9o6,PintechUSA,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:33 2015 UTC,"The drum pads are made out of aluminum and titanium, and we use mesh heads.  Our mesh heads have a special rubberized coating around the edge that helps them stretch over time without tearing.  This is big, because it makes them last a LOT longer. Available in black or white mesh.  Our drum pads also have sensitivity knobs on the sides.  These allow you to turn the sensitivity up and down without having to mess around with the settings in the module.  You would have 1 knob for a single zone, and 2 knobs for a dual zone.  The drum pads are also powder-coated, and we have a few colors to choose from.  In regards to the cymbals, we make 3 lines.  The first line is our TC Series.  These are made out of a Polypropylene, and are the most cost-efficient.  They are very bendable, and are virtually impossible to crack.  The down side is that they don't have much ""rebound"" to them.  Mostly for beginning drummers.  The next line would be our PC series.  These are made out of Poly-carbonate... The same stuff that riot shields and bullet proof glass is made out of!  Now this stuff is tough, and more rigid.  Not impossible to crack if you are a super heavy hitter, but they offer a better response and feel.  The last series is our Visulite, which is our most expensive.  These are 1/4"" acrylic cymbals that are offered in 12 different colors.  We use a specialized acrylic that makes it virtually impossible to break.  They are impact resistant, and offer the best feel.  They feel VERY close to a brass cymbal on an acoustic kit, and come with cymbal springs that mimic real movement.  We hand-make these in our factory from scratch, and each one is literally a piece of art once we are finished with them.  Every cymbal has its own characteristics that make it unique.  The kick drum that comes with the PDK1000 is 8 inches, and is more than big enough for a double pedal if you want to go that route.  It also features a mesh head for quietness.  From there, you have your basic metal tubing for the rack, plastic clamps, etc etc.  The PDK1000 has been a best seller for many of our dealers, and we've been doing our best to keep up with the orders since we came out with it about a year ago.  There are many kits around the same price range that have their pros and cons.  But we feel that the all mesh heads and the heavy-duty build of our drums makes them a great deal for the money.

It adds to the discussion, and people can learn things.  I will never say that what we make is better than a different company - But I will say that we do things differently, and try to explain why we do them that way.  A lot of times I can bring something up, and people will go ""oh wow, that makes sense... Never thought of it that way...""

drums,3dqx9f,Kelavmeister,2,Sat Jul 18 23:31:26 2015 UTC,"I assume these are B8. I can't imagine they'd use B20. Regardless, this is a fantastic idea. If only I wasn't planning on buying a house and sound proofing the basement I'd buy these instead."
drums,3dqx9f,Woosier,2,Sun Jul 19 11:31:43 2015 UTC,"Most likely. They're made for practice. No need to use the good stuff.   I hope your house works out. I have a nice closet that's drum set size in my house that I did some soundproofing to. It's still way too loud for the neighbors, though. Besides, my ears could use the break."

drums,3dqx9f,Kelavmeister,2,Sun Jul 19 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, I must have missed the boat. Everyone murdered the Gen16's so hard in every way, I didn't realize you liked the actual cymbals. They'll be in stock at Greenbrier Music post haste!"
drums,3dqx9f,slowboard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"Well, for the price that Zildjian was charging for the Gen16's, they were a total ripoff.  They're alright electronic cymbals, but from what I've gathered, they can be pretty unreliable (cutting out quite a bit).  Charging $700-800 for a cymbal pack was highway robbery.  As far as the feel vs. volume they project, though, they're incredible.  They really are the perfect low-volume practice cymbal.  I really wish Zildjian would have went this route in the first place.  Edit: I'll be a day one customer of yours if you get the new L80's in stock, though.  I think they come out in September sometime."
drums,3dqx9f,Jacktdrums,3,Mon Jul 20 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not trying to hate on it, because I am intrigued, but the full kit was averaging 100dB and the muted kit was around 85dB? Not too much quieter, huh? Sounds better than those Gens though!"
drums,3dqx9f,theseleadsalts,21,Sat Jul 18 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"dB is logarithmic, I believe. That is significantly quieter."
drums,3dqx9f,beatles910,13,Sat Jul 18 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"Indeed, decibels are logarithmic, and 20 dB increase is 100 times the sound pressure, and around 4 times louder in perception (source with handy chart)"
drums,3dqx9f,Kelavmeister,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation! I should know that, but my physics is long behind me. The Gen16s are totally quiet up close so if these are any quieter I'm amazed!"
drums,3dqx9f,theseleadsalts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. They should be as quiet as the Gen16, I think"
drums,3dqx9f,OttselDax,2,Sun Jul 19 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"If they're anything like the Gen16's, they are remarkably quiet up close.  You could speak at a normal volume and still be heard while playing those.  I think the reason why those are picking up around 85 dB is because you get a decent ping from the cymbals, but they die almost immediately.  It's a different kind of volume."
drums,3dqx9f,elroso,4,Sat Jul 18 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"They are practice cymbals man. A large percentage of the drum community have trouble practicing because it's too loud for their neighbors, or room/house mates. These cymbals give drummers a chance to finally be able to practice without being put on a ""timer."" Don't be so negative. Be positive!  Edit: my comment is meant for Kelavmeister."
drums,3dqx9f,elroso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:31 2015 UTC,lol. I was wondering what you were talking about.
drums,3dqx9f,STylerMLmusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:53 2015 UTC,dB is not linear as most people believe.  All you need to do is try the Gen16 to realize how much quieter they are.
drums,3dqx9f,STylerMLmusic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"It is generally accepted that when dealing with amplitude (loudness), an increase of 10db will double the perceived volume. For example 90db will be twice as loud as 80db."
drums,3dqx9f,STylerMLmusic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"Right, like they were saying it's logarithmic. Makes total sense!"

drums,3dtntu,Rocker95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:47 2015 UTC,One way is connect the audio out on both modules to a mixer and then plug your headphones or speakers into the mixer. If you don't have a mixer then connect the audio out on the cymbal module to the mix in on the td30 module.

The snare hits an accent on 1 of bar two. The kick plays a quarter, eighth rest on 2, an eighth, dotted eighth and sixteenth in bar one and eighths on and 3 in bar two.

drums,3dpxgj,TehNewDrummer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:58:23 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that's because some rhythms are perhaps fuzzy or open to interpretation?
drums,3dpxgj,TehNewDrummer,3,Sat Jul 18 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. The rhythms were the easy part. I'm confident enough to claim 90%+ accuracy on that front. The very hard part was orchestration or the voicing of the drums and cymbals. I can hear the complete rhythm, but which notes belong where is a different story. The video only shows so much, and the audio suffers terribly when it's slowed down. What would help is if I had the isolated drum track from that session, but I can't wish for that luxury."
drums,3dpxgj,Cheungman,4,Sat Jul 18 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Did you slow down the song to detect each hit? If I were to do it I would listen at a quarter speed and chart each individual drum separately. But then, I have no talent for transcription. How DID you do it, man? This is amazing."
drums,3dpxgj,jays2015,3,Sun Jul 19 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That is precisely how I did it. I bought the DVD, slowed it down in VLC (sweet spot between 60-80% speed) and transcribed it one measure at a time. I would listen for anchor-points like the hi-hat and cowbell, write those in first, then fill in the rest with what my ears were hearing and eyes were seeing. If you listen to a song enough times with a decent understanding of notation, your brain connects the dots. The only time I had it at quarter speed was to watch his right hand for the first 2 counts of measure 32 in my transcription (sextuplet figure) - it was so difficult to figure out what he was doing there.  The audio suffers terribly under 50% speed and it's hard to discern things in the mix. If I had the isolated drum track, then it'd be infinitely easier to achieve 100% accuracy."

However, at a certain point you might as well have no reso head. A guy I went to college with was in the studio and the engineer took his kick, a 16"" crash, and a razor blade, traced a circle and called it done.

I've had the same kit my whole ""career"" and only recently replaced the reso head with a fiberskyn that I probably won't port.  Anyway, the port allows air to leave the drum quickly limiting the resonation inside the drum.  I personally feel like it's a mater of preference and a good sound is achievable with both options, I am currently enjoying how much more depth I get out of my kick with an uncut reso."

It doesn't really have anything to do with this thread, but I'm just going to let it all out.  Here's my story:  I threw my back out pretty badly at a gig.  I had the big plastic hardware case that fit everything, and I had opted not to get the version with wheels, and I'd been horsing it around all day.  I was tired, but didn't realize I was on the verge of a back injury.  It started to rain and the band leader called it, so I threw a tarp over my tubs and started breaking things down.  I was hunched over, and I turned and bent to get my stick bag which was on the ground.  Whammo.  Like I'd been shot.  Fell off the stool.  Hurt so bad I couldn't breathe.  Had to ask the little old men from the sax section to help me load up, then I drove home.  Could barely breathe the whole drive home.  Every time I moved my upper body I had horrible shooting pains through my whole body.  Got home, asked my wife to take me to the instacare.  I was laid up on tranquilizers for 2 weeks, and my back has never been the same.  I know you don't need my advice, and this has more to do with me than you, but for the love of Jerry, I hope you have your gear broken up into several smaller cases and that you're lifting with your legs.  Cheers!"

Talk to the other guys you're playing with and let them know that it'd help if they could cue you for stops and other changes. I'm sure that, once you start the songs, you'll figure them out fairly easily. Chances are you've heard the material plenty of times before.   Most of all, have fun. Folks in the crowd couldn't care less about a few mistakes here and there. Just make sure you don't stop playing if you mess up."
drums,3dsu7t,Biggityzig,5,Sun Jul 19 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. Get to the gig early and talk to the other guys, have them explain some of the trickier parts and have them give you cues. If you have time after you get there find out the songs, open up YouTube on your phone, and make some charts to the ones you don't know. And the biggest thing is whatever you do don't stop playing if you miss a cue. 90% of audience won't know you messed up, so don't sweat it when you stayed on the ride when you were supposed to switch to the open hihat. You just have to remember there's only so much you can do in a last minute fill in gig, we perform music not miracles."

It's 25 different fills split up over five lessons. The instructor is on point and although it starts off being very simple the lessons increase in difficulty at a challenging pace.  Playing them all at 100bpm was a difficult for me but once I slowed them down and practiced it was a piece of cake.   Also the full website has search options where you can start with just beginner lessons or filter it out by topic, like if you want to improve your hi hat game there's lessons for that.

drums,3dq1mj,bodegas,2,Sat Jul 18 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"Mesh heads are better, but not that much better. I upgraded from a roland td3 (rubber heads except for snare) to a td12 about 5 years ago (all mesh heads) and while the kit sounds and feels better, its still nothing like my acoustic kits. Also, electric kits are much tighter feeling, everything is closer together mostly due to the smaller radius of the heads. As far as noise goes, you must live on the bottom floor of your apartment. When I was in college, and bought my first TD3 as mentioned earlier, my downstairs neighbors politely asked that I don't play at night because its still quite audible, especially the kick. So, OP, as a potential buyer, don't come to the understanding that they are silent.   As for Alesis, I have never used their e-drums but have owned some studio gear from them which has been solid, however i've heard that their drums are not as great, but that is just word of mouth. Go to a drum store and try to play them if you can, and get a solid set of headphones if you buy one."

drums,3dq1mj,s0tcrates,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:01 2015 UTC,"It would still be loud enough to annoy anyone in the room if they are trying to concentrate on something else. As for neighbors, I guess it depends on a lot of things like insulation / wall sizes. It's certainly better than an acoustic kit for the noise issue however don't think that they are silent. If you have a drum shop or guitar center near you, go play one of listen to others to see how loud they are!"
drums,3dq1mj,format32,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:08 2015 UTC,I came from an acoustic drum background and decided to start playing again. Thought electronic would be the way to go..

The feel, even of mesh heads does not respond the same way as a real drum head. I only see it as a last resort ie, living in an apartment and needing to practice late at night or something. At that point based on costs, I would just buy a good quality practice pad"
drums,3dq1mj,Windstorm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"I've only owned a Roland set of electronic drums, so I am biased. They are industry standard, next to Yamaha and few others. But, of course, hefty, HEFTY price tag. I don't electronic drums any more, but I would go as far as saying the Alesis kit would get the job done just fine for whatever price point their products are at. Remember to think solely about what your needs are. Practice only? Go budget-minded. If you're looking for something to use live or in a home studio situation, obviously invest for quality. Don't get caught in online review hype. Best way is to support your local drum shop and go in to try some kits out. Hope this helps."
drums,3dq1mj,mykidthinksiamwierd,2,Sat Jul 18 12:06:27 2015 UTC,"I love electronic kits since it's great to be able to play any time and experiment with sounds.  They're a big investment though, especially for a mid-range or high-end kit. Most people will recommend buying second hand which will save you some cash but I had a used kit wear out around a year after I bought it so your mileage may vary...  I was considering Alesis the last time I was looking for a kit but I tried one in a store and hated how the pads felt and sounded (very loud, especially compared to mesh).  Maybe see if you can find one to try in store though.  Roland or Yamaha are definitely the leaders in e-drums.   Roland's mesh pads are great and Yamaha has an interesting drum head made out of silicone or something like that which some people like better.  Yamaha kits tend to run a few hundred dollars cheaper than the Roland equivalents.  Definitely make sure the kit you're looking at has a mesh/silicone snare at the very least.  Rubber toms are okay at first but you may want mesh toms eventually.  Something like the Roland TD-11K could be a good option at around $1000 in the States, which is fairly inexpensive for an e-kit.  By the way, sometimes people don't realize that kits typically don't come with a kick pedal so make sure to factor that into your budget."
drums,3dq1mj,HeIsntMe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:54:19 2015 UTC,"If you go with electronic, the only brands I trust are Roland and Yamaha. I use electronics because I have a house full of small kids and my only practice time is late at night. I would still use acoustic if I could. In fact, I will be returning to acoustic soon (and keep the electronics for late night practicing). If you can have acoustic, I would suggest sticking with it or getting electronics for times when an acoustic is not going to work.   Edit: don't dismiss getting something used from Craigslist."

drums,3dq1mj,Koulyone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you can get a lot more for your money going acoustic instead of electric mostly because of how much Roland and Yamaha control the ekit market right now.  I've never owned an acoustic kit sadly, but I use a TD-30 and I can say that I would much rather prefer an acoustic set and play between 1pm and 5pm than being able to play all day on an ekit.  If you really have your mind set on an electronic kit though, I would only really recommend Roland and getting nothing less than what a TD-15kv can do, but that costs at least $2000 brand new and probably around $1200-$1500 on craigslist.  And, yes the sounds are pre-recorded, but there's just a fakeness that is still there with ekits and it will probably be there until some advancements in the technology for ekits is significantly improved.  So if you can go acoustic, do that, but if not Roland kits are the next best thing in my opinion."

drums,3dowqu,Hawkinsmj6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:29:37 2015 UTC,I prefer Wurth trueglide. I use it at work to lubricate everything from rubber o-rings to sunroof cassettes. I lube all of my drum gear with the stuff and it works great.
drums,3dnxbt,beta_particle,5,Fri Jul 17 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend an AAX omni. I have one and it both crashes super well and has great stick definition. As everything, see if you can try it out in store somewhere before you buy it."

drums,3dnxbt,drumguy17,2,Fri Jul 17 21:20:47 2015 UTC,Zildjian's 21 K crashride might be a good fit.

The stick definition gets covered up a bit by the wash, so I guess in your case one of the other options may be better. Again, I'm unfamiliar with the Sabians. For me, the Sweet Ride is my go-to crash/ride, and you can't beat the value (again, you can get them used at a great price, but if you don't want to buy used cymbals then maybe pursue other options.)"
drums,3dnxbt,AndrewUtz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:10 2015 UTC,I use a 22 k ride as my right crash and I love it. I use the sweet ride as my left crash and I love it as well!

It's beautiful that you're using her memory as motivation to pursue something that you want to do with your life.  Find a good teacher in your area and take some lessons, even if it's just a couple to find out where you are and where you need to go. You don't want to sign up for a college audition and then find out the hard way that you were in over your head. Furthermore, a good teacher (meaning a performer whom you want to emulate as well as someone with strong pedagogical skills) can help you find the right school for you way better than any of us bums on reddit.  Best of luck to you man."
drums,3dn6ap,JehRah,2,Sat Jul 18 03:45:30 2015 UTC,Drum camps are another way you can go. They're pretty expensive but I'm my opinion worth it. Mike Johnson has drumming camps and so does Thomas Lang. Space is limited and have to jump on them quick but if you have the time it is worth checking out for sure.

You should be stoked that there is something that you need to practice. Instead of getting down about it, use it as a motivator to sit at the kit and practice and practice and practice until your not only at the level you used to be, but far beyond it. I recently couldn't play for a month due to a shoulder injury, and when I sat down at my kit again I could barley play a single stroke roll that was completely even and clean. Rather then getting upset about it I used it as a motivator to practice and get my chops back. Drumming isn't like riding a bike you lose it when you don't use it, so don't get frustrated with yourself, that will only demotivate yourself.  So what you can't play some of the old things you used to be able to right now. Give it a week and some serious practice and I guarantee that you will be able to. You have to be patient with yourself, if it takes longer to achieve what you want then so what? Again try to use it as a motivator and don't let it discourage you, you will get there i promise."

drums,3dlcja,Retart-OneSixty,3,Fri Jul 17 05:08:31 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by identify the drumbeat? I'm a little confused by that. Do you want a transcription or a general idea of what's going on? I'll do the latter.  It's AABA form, with the A section being a kind of funk/slightly latin thing and the B in swing. 32-bar form I think, so each section lasts 8 bars.  To play the main A groove you're looking at improvising around the main drumbeat the drummer plays, which is an off-beat snare and lots of ghost notes on the snare, filling in between the hi-hat in such a way that you're essentially playing straight 16ths between both hands.  Don't look at it as trying to transcribe and play what the drummer is doing though (although it could technically maybe be a good exercise in itself) as he's improvising and the variations on the main beat is how he leaves his mark on the piece compared to any other drummer - and you should do the same with your performance, even if it means playing a simplified version of what this drummer is doing."
drums,3dlcja,nosenseofwonder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:32 2015 UTC,"I recognized the swing pattern that they switch to, I just didn't know what the funk/latin groove was. I just really thought it was cool how the whole rhythm section switches between that laid back, kinda half-time feel and the up-tempo swing. You can hear really well how the bass also transitions from half notes and off-beats to straight quarters. On the head, yes it's in AABA form (they switch for the bridge), but later underneath the soloists they change that form in a way such that I don't know what their pattern is, if there is one. Some really cool stuff, and an interesting approach to this jazz standard.   Edit: To answer your question, I wasn't looking for someone to transcribe, but just give me a general idea of what kind of style the drummer was using, because it's certainly nothing that Charlie Parker's drummer would've done."
drums,3dlcja,nosenseofwonder,2,Fri Jul 17 16:59:21 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhh...I'm sorry man, but I don't think you're really reading my answer.  First off, this isn't bebop, this is Fusion and while Bebop is the driving influence in all jazz, this song retains more elements of funk a'la Herbie Hancocks Headhunters. What the drummer is playing especially brings Harvey Mason and Mike Clarks 'displaced' backbeat playing to mind. The drummer is always playing the backbeat on 2, but often displaces the backbeat onto a different beat, off-beat, or just leaves the void their and fills in with ghost notes. It actually comes from James Brown-style funk (check out songs like Cold Sweat - heavy groove and a displaced backbeat). If you want to play fusion, and it seems like you have an interest in it, like any other genre, I'd recommend listening to as much of it as possible and letting the music seep into you.  The song is AABA - the whole way through. When they solo, they solo over the form, usually once or twice each. The drums solo by trading 8's over the AABA form twice - and you can hear the drummer plays a more swinging style when he trades 8's in the B section. It's not random, all the soloists and musicians are constantly aware of the form and refer back to it in their playing.   After trading 8's, it opens up to 'feature' the drummer. He has freedom here and the form is dropped (I think, I don't have time to go and count it, but he may actually be playing exactly a chorus or two), but he refers back to the final A section at the end to lead the band back to the head (the head being the entire AABA form of the song, which they play once and finish on - standard for most jazz songs).  Anyway, I'd recommend listening to a lot of Jazz and following the form, through solo's and being aware of it at all time. It's work at first, but you'll start to 'feel' the form moving even when you're not trying after a while (as it's more to do with harmonic movements than counting bars) and a lot of it will come just from listening.  When I say your response wasn't really reading my post, and I don't want to sound condescending, but I mean it in much the same way as you weren't really listening to the form. I'm really trying to encourage you here, but I don't want to baby you either. I get the feeling you were talking some random jazz info to try and demonstrate knowledge and save face or something - but this isn't an argument, and we're all here to learn from each other. I hope you can take my advice on board - because it was passed on to me from some fantastic musicians and I've benefited immensely from it myself. Good luck!"
drums,3dlcja,Canwang,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"The reason I refer to jazz/bebop is because this tune is a Charlie Parker song. Yes, I agree with you 100% that the style in this arrangement is much more funk/fusion than it is bebop, like the original.   You're correct -- the form is AABA the whole way through. This is a rhythm changes tune (see I Got Rhythm, Lester Leaps In, Meet the Flintstones), and they all have that same form and changes. However, the pattern that the rhythm section uses switching between cut-time feel and normal groove does not always stay AABA. There are whole choruses played in swing underneath the soloists, so it's not JUST the B section that they change the texture for. I never said that there isn't a pattern, because there definitely is, considering that the whole rhythm section transitions together as one.   I already understand jazz forms and progressions, (as it's something I've studied a lot, and I listen to it all the time). I don't, however, listen to a lot of funk/jazz/fusion stuff, which is why this one really interests me. It's certainly something that I want to look into more and start to get a better understanding of.   Thanks for all the feedback you've given me! I don't have much understanding of playing set (as I'm primarily a horn player), but I would really like to learn and broaden my horizons a bit."

A lot of people sell ONLY the drums, with no stands/pedal/throne.  $450 may get you some decent drums and hardware, but you'll have a very hard time finding nice cymbals with that budget. You can make cheap drums sound good with nice heads, but that is not the case with cymbals.  Here's a list of all the drum sets we sell between $300 - $500 with cymbals and hardware. Are they a great way to begin your drumming journey? Yes. Do they sound good enough for a professional (paying) gig? Probably not."

The SBRs are technically below B8s but they sound and respond similarly.  You have to make sure the store you call has the ""old stock"" with the virgin kick. They also carry it in black.

Working down to ever finer grits.  Same goes for the finish. Poly is a giant PITA to work with if you aren't meticulous. Very easy to leave brush marks and bubbles in it...and nothing is worse than finding a loose bristle stuck in the poly that makes  you want to kick yourself afterward.  Treat the project like fine woodworking, read and don't cut corners! You will be immensely happy with the results if you take the time to do it right.  Also, ventilation! Plus a clean environment...dust settling onto a tacky finish will also make you curse the gods.  Former finish carpenter/woodworker...always had issues with stain and poly  ;)"

drums,3diq1e,Honeybair7400,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"This has a lot to do with the orchestration of the pattern. Notice how in the heavier examples the groove was placed on the bell of ride with a lot of crashes. This gives more attack and causes the ride to lead the beat. But when you just play the ride quietly with more of a jazz technique, like the animals song, you get a completely more laid back feel that relies on the sustain of the ride cymbal leaving space for the snare to carry the groove. There's a lot of little variations you can create in the sound of the notes you play that effect the overall feel. These are some great examples!"

drums,3dglly,danarbok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll try to see if I can dig some up.  Frankly, I think it's common because it's maybe the only widely applicable advice that you can give to all drummers. There are a lot of videos out there about interesting fills and neat techniques, but those new tools that you can choose to use or completely forego in developing your voice and expressing yourself. The idea of keeping it simple and ""playing for the music"" is some of the only widely applicable advice that is out there in drumming. Furthermore, I think the idea of the old switcharoo video is a popular vehicle for that advice because people on youtube (and at festivals like modern drummer) are so focused on showing off all of their tricks/fills/techniques.  I think there is a time and place for that stuff, and that time/place would be on youtube, drumming festivals, etc. It is an event made for drummers to show off. Some people who don't play much with others can't really separate that from a band setting, so it's a good impart that serving the music is important.  Hopefully I can find more videos on that subject. In the meantime, here is one that touches on the same idea in a much more sarcastic way.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J95Qdjw4crA"

You would be surprised how many reputable independent distributors list used items online, and also ship these items. If you find a place that you think might work, search for reviews of the shop/vendor before purchase, as they can clue you in on a potentially bad situation before you end up in one.  Also, the dreaded Guitar Center does list some used items online, and will ship to the store closest to you(if applicable) with no additional charge."
drums,3diqkz,DrEvazan1138,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:46:44 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. I was looking through google a bit but wasn't sure if there was some sort of drummers ebay type thing. Now back to google!
drums,3diqkz,DrEvazan1138,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"Hello again!  I was just wondering if you might be able to answer another question for me.   I'm looking at some used cymbals and came across this:  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Zildjian-Used-Zildjian-20in-ZBT-Ride-Cymbal-111230647-i4420132.gc  Now there are several coming up on GC's site that are ZBT. I end up googling that and I come up with:  ZBT (""Crisp, Clean, and Defined"") – Zildjian's low-end line of sheet bronze cymbals. The ZBT alloy contains 92% Copper and 8% Tin and comes in a traditional finish. ZHT (""Bold, Bright, and Melodic"") – Zildjian's high-end line of sheet bronze cymbals.  Does this mean it is just made out of different materials than the Z Custom, that is has a different sound than z custom, different quality,  or all of the above?  Thanks Again.   Edit: Also, why is Guitar Center bad? Is there something I should know about or are they generally just not a good business?"
drums,3diqkz,DrEvazan1138,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"All of the above.  With cymbals, there are two primary ways that they are made, cast or stamped.  Cast cymbals are mixed, poured, and shaped into what are called blanks. The blanks are then hammered and lathed to the desired shape, profile, weight, etc, either by a person or machine.  Stamped, or sheet cymbals, are made by using a large press to literally cut the shape of the cymbal out of a large premade sheet of alloy. They are entirely machine made and lack the finer audible qualities of the cymbals. Often, when compared to cast cymbals, you will notice a one dimensional sound, and will often sound brash in comparison to a similar size/weight in a cast cymbal.  That said, I have come across many sheet cymbals like the ZHT or ZBT that actually sound really good, for a specific purpose. I still own a ZBT Plus ride from when I was a kid that, given the right context, is the perfect cymbal. VERY pingy, cuts through anything."
drums,3diqkz,thewhits,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"Ok awesome, So essentially these ZHT and ZBT can sound good for certain things but in general the Z Custum is going to be a superior cymbal in most all regards? I should've known I was getting myself into a deeper hole than I knew! I will probably end up sticking with the Z customs since I know that's the sound he likes/wants.   Seriously, thanks a lot for your help with this, he will be thrilled and surprised."

Another thing to keep in mind is in his method, you will tire out very quickly and probably develop not-so-great habits. You are better off getting the technique right and simply practicing with a metronome. What is proper technique? A combination of all of the tried and true ones. Basically you end up smashing together everything Jojo Mayer has put together with Mike Manginis technique thrown in there. This isn't necessarily easy, but proper technique will result in speed."

The pitch of a drum is mostly determined by its diameter, and tuning (within the range where the head vibrates well, i.e. not too loose, not too tight). Depth of the shell affects sustain more than it does pitch or timbre, if you want to get rid of excessive low end just tune higher, and/or in the case of the bass drum, add muffling (e.g. rolled towel taped against the batter head).   Tama has more lugs on floor tom for better tuning   I'd prefer 8 lugs instead of 6 on a 16in shell, especially with flanged instead of die-cast hoops (flanged warp more easily)."

Try some technical metal or some blastbeats if you've got a double pedal. Try to combine styles to keep yourself on your toes, like putting a 3/2 clave over country, or a bossa over hiphop. Something that doesn't quite make sense, try to make it work."
drums,3dgmyi,licensedtodill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:22:18 2015 UTC,I am usually a punk/rock drummer but in a similar attempt to expand my abilities I delved deeply into jazz going all the way back to adjusting hand grip and looking up the bop of the 1950's. It certainly set me on a long road of self improvement as changing things like grip and style caused me to digress before I could progress.

drums,3dgmyi,quixotic120,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:18:13 2015 UTC,purposefully look for something outside of your comfort zone. you can also revisit something that you haven't worked on in awhile and integrate it in new ways; e.g. maybe you spend a week focusing on paradiddles and integrating them into fills or even building entire beats based on the pattern.   also switch setup. i don't mean simply rearranging a bit (although sometimes that can open up new ideas) but set up alternate to your dominant hand and practice that (or just play open for an easier option but I like the independence practice that comes with switching feet as well)

What broke me out of my rut this time was learning some songs that are ALL about dynamics -- basically the entire song is a layering build starting with extremely soft snare rolls.  Trying to play accurately while playing REALLY softly is a great exercise in itself.  Finding interesting ways to ""stack"" the song as you build it up can be challenging too as you figure out how to build without overdoing it and not filling too much space."
drums,3dgmyi,thecrsinger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"Recently I've super into doing ""Call and answer"" type playing with other drummers. Take turns setting the base groove and within that groove take turns with a little ""solo"" of sorts every 2 bars. Draw upon each other and learn from the other drummer's style. When asked teach/explain what you were doing so the other drummer can learn too. Teaching and explaining is super important because you're giving external meaning to the concepts running through your head that you were just playing.  I started into drumming with a love of punk/grunge and late 90s alt rock and quickly got into bluesy swing. So that was the core of my playing for a while. I've done this with people who play rock ballad styles, jazz, blues, latin and more that are more nuanced for me to care to explain. This really pushed my understanding of what was going on while playing. I've learned to take mental notes of the patterns and note values I'm giving my playing and the similarities/differences that exist between the genres that other players are laying down."

drums,3dhgdt,Buck_Thunderpumper,2,Thu Jul 16 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, so people are gonna tell you alot of different things here.  Other folks will argue whether you should even clean them.  Bottom line is, if you have a brilliant or non-raw cymbal finish, it's fine to clean them.  Let me summarize the different suggestions you'll get:   Ketchup and vinegar work, but leave your cymbals smelling awful.   Soap and water work decently well, but you need a non-abrasive towel that you don't care about to dry off. Bottled cymbal cleaners work great, but they can remove logos, and cost $$.  Since you're a musician, I assume you are poor like the rest of us.  Also some people report that these have a negative impact on the sound of the cymbal (especially ones that have acetone in them). Other non-cymbal specific cleaners (such as Barkeeper's friend) also work very well, same points as above. My recommendation: a lemon.   That's it.  A freakin lemon.  Cut that bad boy in half and scrub the crap outta your cymbal (both top and bottom).  You can use the other half if needed.  Just rinse off with water afterwards.  Lemons don't really leave any after-smell, and it cheap and easy.  It also doesn't have any harmful chemicals that other solutions do.  There's quite a few videos out there, but this one is my favorite.   Good luck."
drums,3dhgdt,winglessveritas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks, I probably go with the lemon. Saw some guy put his cymbal in coke but I don't like the sound of that. I'm also wary of the smell the vinegar or ketchup would leave on it if I did it."

drums,3dhgdt,TheBigDrewbowski,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:04:36 2015 UTC,"Start with hand soap and water, and just use your hands. Takes care of most of the loose stuff, and smaller gunk that gets down in the grooves. Then you can use whatever has a thicker consistency, to grab the rest of the gunk, that's suggested in other posts, or follow up the soap and water with whatever cymbal company you prefer's branded cymbal polish / cleaner. I personally use Zildjian's, personal preference though."
drums,3dhgdt,twolfe04,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Even though these crazy sounding methods seem to work, I don't know how I feel about using them on expensive cymbals.

Be careful around the cymbal logo, it will fade if you use the cleaner over it."

Also, I would HIGHLY recommend listening to the way Tony Williams plays uptempo ride cymbal. It's not just ding dig-a-ding dig-a-dig the whole time, he mixes it up all the time. The only thing that really stays consistent is the quarter note, and it's not only easier, but also sounds a whole lot better than playing the stock ride pattern all the time."

Speaking of snarestands, definitely consider getting one for the practice pad or using the one you already have, putting the practice pad on a flat surface is kinda awkward imo."
drums,3dg0jd,Blizzaze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:05:23 2015 UTC,Cool I'll definitely look into getting a 12 inch pad. Do you know what the Vic firth or HQ percussion pads are like?
drums,3dg0jd,Blizzaze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"I used a Vic Firth a couple times at drum school and I don't think there is a big difference. The Evans is maybe a little firmer, but I think the only thing that really matters is that you get a respectable brand so it doesn't wear off after 2 weeks."
drums,3dg0jd,Ecips_Dlo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:10:44 2015 UTC,I use a 12 inch double sided Evans RealFeel.  Can't really go wrong with it as far as I'm concerned.
drums,3dg0jd,Rocker95,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:11:54 2015 UTC,"I use a 6"" Evans RealFeel pad, which screws into a nice, compact stand.  In my opinion, getting the 6"" can be better since it's easy to take it with you on the go, and it helps with precision because of its size.  Not saying that you can't travel with the 12"", it just takes up more space."

The other Ludwigs might be '60s kits, or they could be a lot newer; the keystone badges were used in the '60s, but also on newer kits. One easy way to check the year is by looking at the internal date stamp, or in lieu of that you can look at the serial number and compare with this website:  http://www.vintagedrumguide.com/serial_numbers.html If there's no serial number it might pre-1963, or else newer and just unlabeled, which I saw the other day on a venue's house kit.

If the corners of the badge is really pointy and has reinforcement rings, you're looking at an early-70s drum. If the badge has more rounded corners and no rings, it's likely late-70s or early-80s."

drums,3deoxl,Severosk,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiments about velcro.   Looking at it, though, why don't you move the pedal back to the other side of the hi hat leg? That's not a moving part on the pedal so you're not going to be actively rubbing and if you're concerned about it, you could put some gaff tape on that part of the pedal to avoid any minor damage.   Additionally, that would help anchor the pedal a little bit (in addition to the velcro).   Another low cost option would be to gaff tape the pedal to your rug."
drums,3deoxl,thedeadlyrhythm42,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:33 2015 UTC,I like the hi hat close to me so having it like that is the best solution.  I will definitely try out some Velcro but if the spikes aren't too expensive I think they are worth getting.

On the hi hat stand there is an adjustment screw that pushes up a plate underneath the bottom felt to purposely mis-align the hi hats so they get a better and more crisp ""chick"" sound (as opposed to a more airy ""whomp"" sound).  Again, I don't want to sound condescending but it's always good to do an idiot check in situations like this."

I know exactly what you're talking about. My sand hats are similar (but nowhere near the level of the 16"" extra dry hats) in the sense that they don't line up perfectly and they can't really be closed super tight.

drums,3ddicr,WoolyBouley,13,Wed Jul 15 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"Short (lazy) version: Get a set of drum mics. Cheap ones will do for now but you'll need to replace them eventually. If you don't feel like replacing, then look into good mics. Get those and a recording interface. Set up more than 1 camera on your kit. Maybe one from behind you and to the side, showing your drums clearly, one above the kit, etc. Look at other people's drum covers for inspiration on angles and camera work. They can be your phone, ipad. or any digital camera regardless of quality. Record a solid cover however you deem fit. You can use the interface and mics in garageband (assuming your interface is compatible). Feel free to use any DAW/recording software that you are comfortable with. Then sync up the videos to your audio and edit them as you please. And then mix/master.

In addition, look into bands you've always liked but considered ""out of reach"" and give it a shot - you may be surprised how approachable some of the stuff may be for you now.

drums,3ddvw3,Seafroggys,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about breaking sticks. They're cheap and they're not mean to last forever anyway.  One thing with the ride would be to move the rest of the stand so the boom isn't so long, or swap that stand out for a straight stand.   Gravity is not on your side, and you're basically hitting something that's already under extra strain due to how far away the fulcrum is.  As others have said, cymbal heights come down to comfort a lot. It also depends on what style of music you play. Softer, more jazzy stuff might be better to have the cymbals lower so you can use the bells, bows, and edges of all of them. If you go too high, you'll be hitting almost nothing but the edges."
drums,3ddvw3,nannulators,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"Great comments. The only thing I can add is to help with your ride spinning.  There are rubber washers (rings) on skateboard trucks. If you can get access to a pair of those, use them like felts on your cymbal stand and then cymbal won't move so much. Also, there are great for hi-hats."
drums,3ddvw3,drumminco77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Cymbals are naturally unbalanced usually. They'll have a scootch more metal in spots and they'll rotate until they find a resting spot.   It sounds like this is happening to you, unless you mean your boom arm is slipping?

Because the seat washer's hole is slightly bigger it sits further down the stand and gives you the extra space you need for a stack. I still recommend an aux arm though!

Sam is a ton of fun to play with because he encourages me to play whatever I feel. He doesn't like songs to sound exactly like the record. That's actually one of the things that led him to play with Jimi Hendrix. He told me that nobody wanted to play with them because they never played what was on the record. He said that they (Jimi included) didn't know if Jimi was good or not. He said Jimi just played. He said he was really surprised when Jimi made it because no one in their circle thought he would. Sam's great. He's got a million stories.

That being said, the black album had a great drum sound altogether, even though it is a bit cheesy (heavy reverb).  I'm probably even more alone on this opinion, but I thought that his drum sound was the best on Load despite everything else about the album kinda sucking."
drums,3dagja,CaptainMatt13,4,Tue Jul 14 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that Black Album snare sound is HUGE in rock production. Apparently people sample it all over the place. Say what you want about Ulrich's playing (I don't get the all-out hate, dude was pretty good in the 80s/90s), but Bob Rock made that kit sound amazing on that record."
drums,3dagja,ProfSkullington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"There's rumors that it was triggered/sampled.  I've seen some heavy arguments going back and forth.  Best evidence I've heard is that in some behind the scenes video footage of them making it, someone saw either a label on the console that says ""snare sample"" or a sampling unit that was working during playback.  Its been awhile since I read these discussions so my memory may be hazy.  Think it was on gearslutz.  Regardless, the drum sound on that record is pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of that clicky bass drum sound.  His bass drum pre-Justice has so much more balls."
drums,3dagja,Seafroggys,2,Tue Jul 14 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"It's super chopped-and-sliced but the sound itself is from the drum. During ...Justice they had Lars do a lot of the drums in 8-measure bursts just so he could maintain intensity and cut all the takes together.  Not the ""purest"" way to do things but it made some great drum tracks."

This one stood out and leaves me unable to resist trying to 'thigh drum' along to it on the bus.  I still don't know what type of snare he used on that album, to be honest, so I should probably look it up."
drums,3dagja,potatoesarethedevil,2,Tue Jul 14 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"The drums on that album sound heavily triggered, if that helps your search.  Love that album.  My favorite snare though is definitely off of Hate by Thy Art Is Murder.  I was sad that the drums lost their character on Holy War."

drums,3dc289,whitewashShalalala,3,Wed Jul 15 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"I've played both, and they both are seriously killer cymbals. As a Meinl guy who generally doesn't like zildjian, these cymbals are awesome. I would recommend the K con over the light ride. It is a bit more versatile and its sound doesn't get lost easy. The 24"" K light puts such a massive blanket of sound over your playing that it can be a little overwhelming. This can be useful in many situations of course, but I think for your genres the K con will be a better fit. You won't be disappointed either way though."

drums,3dc289,lord_of_vader,2,Fri Jul 17 09:57:28 2015 UTC,"I played a K Con 22"" for a few years and then ended up buying a 24"" Light Ride. The deal maker/breaker was the bell. I thought the Light Ride had a better one so I went there.  Considerations: the 24"" is a LOT of cymbal, but in general the Ks are very predictable with sound. K Cons... not as much but still very good.  Also, most cymbal bags and vaults come in a 22"" so you'll have to get a new one if you get the Light Ride. I bought the Kerope 24 bag for mine and it's great. Also consider there is a 22"" K Light Ride available as well.  You will love either one, but make a wise choice."

drums,3dc289,SpoonLord23,2,Wed Jul 15 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"I own the 24"" K Light Ride. I absolutely love it! It's probably the most dynamic ride cymbal I have ever played. One can get all different kinds of sounds in the right hands. Because it's so dynamic, it feels like taming an animal, you got to really learn to work with it and have control over it (the thinner weight and large size contribute to this). If you can do this then you really can bring out the best in this cymbal.   Bottom line: it is not a one dimensional sounding cymbal, if you can learn to master it, it sounds and feels like heaven."

Playing it with the bead, versus laying the shank on the face of the cymbak, versus crashing it, all three totally different and great sounds, and moving the aging area closer to the Bell and closer to the edge creates different tones... It really is like taming an animal, never thought of it that way"
drums,3dc289,jdbrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"Another way of looking at it, is like getting to know a new person, and discovering their various layers. Essentially becoming friends with the cymbal."
drums,3dc289,funkytomtom,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"Hi!   Both are currently in my set-up, and they're very very different. Here's a bit of what i consider to be pros and cons(no pun intended).  24"" K Light  Pros    Fantastic wash Clear stick definition Cutting Bell Amazing when you want a huge sound Works well in your genres except  for lighter jazz I'd say.    Cons   Loud af. And it needs a bit of power to open up properly.  Hard. To. Play. Not for everyone.    All in all a fantastic cymbal, but like /u/SpoonLord23, it's a cymbal you truly have to master to get the most out of it.   22"" Cons Medium thin low  Pros   Great for lighter playing Opens up with no efforts what so ever Most wonderful sounding bell ever Stick definition to die for Works well in your genres except for maybe hard indie rock   Cons   A little too buttery when washed on Does not cut through when incorporated in heavier stuff   So this is my favorite cymbal of all time. It's so fun to play and all in all the best sounding cymbal I've ever heard. If i had to choose one of the two, It would have to be this one.   It all comes down too what you want more.  In your face, dark and washy, or dreamy, dark, clear and defined. I couldn't choose, so I got both, lol.

It's kind of like the ""Must have 2 years experience"" clause in a job offering for an entry level position; I need a job to get experience but I need experience to get a job.... That sorta thing.  All of the musicians I play with I've met from playing gigs with other musicians, or they're friends of musicians I've played with.  There's a trend among all of my musician friends where we only hire from within our inner circle. And if we need to go outside of it, we typically won't ever call someone unless someone from our inner circle vouches for them.  When you were kicked out of those bands, did you burn all your bridges or can you still reach out to some of those guys? When I'm asking for a favor from friends, like its not a paid gig but maybe I wrote some hooks and want to jam on them, I'll do the work of finding a rehearsal space, paying for it if necessary, buying a few six packs of beer and picking up some little caesars pizzas and host it like a small hang between friends. If you can afford to do that, call ONE of the guys you used to play with, and ask him if he's got friends who would be interested in jamming. But try to get friends of friends, in order to increase your ""circle"".  You don't have to be the best, you just have to be solid, and have people vouch for you"

I've done a lot, recorded a lot, toured a lot, but nothing ever came out of it, and that's fine.    I had a similar career ""arc"" as I'm sure a lot of us here did. Becoming locally known and ""in demand""... bands getting signed... recording... touring... having lots of fun and working my ass off... then the next step never happens.  I got into my early 30's... my band had recorded a new album which I am still very proud of. It just never went anywhere beyond ""regional"". I decided it was time to grow up and walked away from the whole thing. I was pretty angry and depressed for awhile... which is why I'm responding to you. Easier said than done... but Dude... you gotta let that shit go.

I love what I've done and have no regrets. And I still actively play, I have bands I play with, I have a youtube channel, and I have a grownup job now as well. But I don't think I could ever leave drumming completely behind, it's embedded into my soul, which is why little things like this just bum me out.   Do bring my situation into perspective a bit.  I once moved to a town for a band that was begging me to play for them. Ended up playing with them for like 4 years, did some awesome tours and such. I recorded a whole album with that band, but the guitarists never finished it and all that was ever done was the drums. Then it just fell apart. Main guitarist is now in a world touring band doing really well for himself (as far as I can tell anyways). But like I said, no regrets, I just reminisce sometimes, thinking about the good ole days. But a lot of that is just memories, the real tangible proof that I did anything musically is from anything I've recorded. And I don't mess around with recordings, because that shit is always there, as long as there is way to play them.  Again, I appreciate it, it's nice hearing from people that have had similar experiences."

I didn't mind not being credited for the recording, after all, the 5 string in the studio and 4 string live thing already made me feel like a harbinger of anarchy.

It is pretty unheard of to have performers on a record get any more than the agreed upon payment for doing the actual recording. The only way around that is if it's agreed upon in a contract ahead of time.  Now, I know one way around it is when the band is credited as a whole for writing the song, no individual people, and the band exists as a legal entity, like a corporation, then the band gets the  royalties, but then those have to be divided up based on some kind of contract that was agreed upon when the ""corporation"" was created.   The legal side of the music business is shitty. And there's constant stories of people getting burned by it. Like Levon Helm. Died broke, even though he sang on a lot of The Bands records, Robbie Robertson is credited with all the writing. Even though according to biographies of the band members, they all contributed equally in both lyric and music writing. But Robertson made all the cash."

drums,3daile,joshoohaah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"Craigslist is the best choice by far.    You could get a kit with cymbals and hardware for that price.  Most likely a 4 piece or 5 piece in standard sizes (22"" bass, 13"" or 14"" Snare, Combination of 10"" 12"", 13"", 14""  and/or 16"" toms).  I'll probably miss some brands, but I'm thinking most likely Pearl, Tama, Yamaha, Ludwig...  As for cymbals, any of the following brands: Zildjian, Sabian, Paiste or Meinl, and you'll want at minimum a Hi Hat and a Ride.  A Crash cymbal or two is nice as well."

drums,3daile,vau1tboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"It certainly is good to be safe, but my experience with drumsets (I've bought 2 in this fashion) is typically you go to the location the kit is already set up and do all inspections and such there.  The seller doesn't always have a means to transport it and a lot of the time, and even if they do, they aren't going to be careful about doing it the right way."
drums,3daile,UselessGadget,2,Tue Jul 14 21:01:25 2015 UTC,I have never bought a large item from there. Just going off past incidents. Still bring a friend especially if you have a friend that plays drums. Also ask questions about them. Dont want another Remo Drumkit
drums,3daile,vau1tboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"Lol.  I hear ya.  The last thing a seller would want to do is pack it up to meet you at a parking lot, just for you to say no and them to have to pack it up and go home.  I'd certainly get as much info as you can and if it seems fishy, get the hell outta there."
drums,3daile,UselessGadget,2,Tue Jul 14 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"Be careful! Very few drum sets come with everything you'll need. Here are the basics:   Drums (Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Rack Tom, Floor Tom) Cymbals (Hi Hats, Ride, Crash) Stands (Hi Hat, Snare Drum, Two Cymbal Stands) Seat Bass Drum Pedal   You can find some screamin' deals on places like Craigslist, but you have to be pretty careful about making sure you're getting everything you need.  Honestly, $400 probably won't get you everything you want at a professional level. You might get some pretty nice drums if you look around enough, but hardware adds up and cymbals are expensive.  We sell some new ""all-in-one"" drum sets that include everything you need for around the $400 - 500 range, but they're definitely beginner quality."

drums,3daile,kfunkorange,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"For a complete set for less than $400, you have to go to the used market. Like everyone is saying, hit up craigslist. You can also try your local music shop because they may have a deal on some used gear.   Be sure to check all cymbals for cracks around the edges (easy to spot) and cracks around the center hole where it rests on the cymbal mount (harder to spot). Edge cracks can be dealt with, but center hole cracks make the cymbal basically unusable.   Also check for defects in the hardware. That shit gets really expensive if you have to replace it.   Finally, understand that you're probably going to need to replace the drum heads on whatever used kit you end up buying. Some wear is fine, but if there are actual indents in the head you've got to replace it (I have seen this; it's baffling)."

drums,3d99ml,SKIN_BEATER,7,Tue Jul 14 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"22"" Vintage Sand Ride. I own one, and granted I bought it before the transition ride came out, but I still like it better. However when it comes to the sand ride, I find the 20"" to be more controllable than the 22"", but the 22"" is more crash-able. The transition ride is nice, but he hype makes it sound better than it is IMO."
drums,3d99ml,FormidableDrummer,4,Tue Jul 14 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"Those sand cymbals might be the best thing in Meinl's lineup, I think. I'd go for the Sand Ride but I'd prefer a 20"" to a 22"" personally."
drums,3d99ml,Joshdecent,5,Tue Jul 14 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'd get the 22 Sand ride, hands down. I find myself crashing on rides quite a bit, and it just sounds better to me than the Transition does. Although that's not to say the Transition ride doesn't sound great, it totally does. I just prefer the sand."
drums,3d99ml,Its_Frosty,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"I have a Byzance Benny Greb Signature Sand Ride, and I've fallen in love with it. Easily the best cymbal I've ever owned. It's just so beautifully, delicately dark. It's going to run you more than a regular Byzance ride, but it's completely worth it."
drums,3d99ml,GelfandDesign,2,Tue Jul 14 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"They're vastly different cymbals.  I think a better comparison for sound and texture would be the 20"" Sand ride and the 21"" Transition.  What kind of sticks do you use? Does the bead allow for more articulation? Vinyl and Ball/Barrel tips will bring out more articulation in the cymbal, more of the sound of when exactly you hit it. Do you want a big, washy, crash, monster? If you use Benny Greb sticks, or anything with a larger bead (Danny Carey, Aaron Spears, 5b Rock) you're going to get a lot of wash and low pitch out of the cymbal.  To get more to my point, what kind of music do you want to play? Do you want to beat the shit out of your ride like it's a crash? Do you want to play fast ride stuff ala bebop/punk/blast beats?  The Sand Ride is washy and huge, fairly dark and will likely have a lower pitch. It's a great cymbal if you already have something that will be articulate and cut through when you need to.  If you want to play more straight ahead rock stuff where you can articulate your playing on the cymbal, the transition will probably be better for you."
drums,3d99ml,withstereosound,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"the transition ride is less airy/ transparent. i think it projects better than the sand ride, but the Sand Ride is more unique in a way, and has an interesting complex character..   really depends on your taste, i think the transition ride is better for funk and rock styles, where the sand ride is better towards jazz or more mellow styles. its a vintage ride thats been sandblasted, and the transition ride has a bit more balls behind it.. just a bit.  a 22"" sand ride is deeper sounding, and the lower the pitch the less they stand out in a mix, just because of the audible frequencies. they sound awesome in recordings because they're mixxed well, but in some live situations, they're easily lost. which may be just what you want. the transition ride is similar but more high end cut imo"

drums,3d99ml,GreenbrierMusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"I have a Transition, and I chose it over the Sand. I feel like the Transition fit me best personally, and I just adore how it sounds. I play mostly Country music (I live in Oklahoma), but I also play jazz every so often. I feel like both rides would work great in a smaller, jazz club setting (which is what I do more), but I learned from experience that the Transition just isn't loud enough to work well in a big band, especially outside. I could've used something heavier. If you don't do jazz, don't worry about it. Haha. Anyway, I wound up choosing the Transition mostly because of the bell. I wanted something that is washy and complex but still has a bell that will cut, and the Transition has exactly that.   Also, where do you plan to go to play them both? I went to every Guitar Center and Sam Ash in the Dallas area looking for a store with a good Meinl selection. Never found one. I ended up buying from Mycymbal.com which (luckily) worked out."

drums,3d940f,SnareSpectre,2,Wed Jul 15 01:04:56 2015 UTC,"This might sound strange, but consider using the Large diaphragm 550s as your overheads instead of the small diaphragm which is what people usually use. This will get you a lot more sound, and when you're only working with 6 mics, you need as much to work with as you can get. It's really all about mic positioning though. Make sure kick drum is ported, drums are tuned, etc."

drums,3d89pg,theforgottenchild,3,Tue Jul 14 07:44:10 2015 UTC,"There's 2 trains of thought here... One would be go and see what feels best and buy that. Ideal if money isn't a major consideration.  The second (which I'd go for personally) is see what you can get a good deal on that will also suit. E.g. A pair of speed cobras may cost, $300, but a similar competitor may be $100. I personally bought a pair of Gibraltar Intruder pedals for no other reason than they were a professional level pedal for a budget price. I wanted a pair of iron cobras and from what i read these were real contenders as they were designed to fit the same category as the likes of DW5000, IC's etc, so it seemed the best value for me at that time... It was, they are every bit as nice to play (for me, a weekend warrior) as the iron cobras were... so I'm happy."

drums,3d89pg,ReVo5000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:25:08 2015 UTC,"I have a speed cobra 910 single pedal and LOVE it. I originally tried it in the store, checked out the settings it allows you to customize and was sold (I didn't even know about the 310 at the time).  I never thought I'd be changing the settings of my pedal at all really but my technique has evolved and so this pedal has allowed me to make changes that better suit my evolving technique.  That being said, I have recently been checking out the 310 because it's cheaper and I need another pedal to travel with but it seems that some of those customization settings are absent (though I could be wrong about that).  Have you played them? do they feel the same? do the 310s have full customization of 910s do?"
drums,3d89pg,big_floppy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"The thing about TAMA's pedals, besides the hard features that are good and there in every other pro-level pedal on the market, is that they usually sell gimmicks with their top of the line.  I know one of the differences between the SC Jr. (310) and the SC (910) are that the Jrs don't come with the cobra coil.  So, I suggest you try a pair of SCs and SC Jrs, to see how you feel about the cobra coil.  Aside from that there's not much of a difference.  To me, the coils are just a gimmick, but others love their cobras because of it.  The Iron Cobras as u/ReVo5000 states is another option from TAMA, but these pedals are heavy feeling (again, not a bad thing, you can certainly go fast with them), which is why the Speed Cobra came into existence.  However, I will say this, if you haven't tried any other brand of pedal on the market, you should do that before dumping that kind of cash on anything like this.  Pearl Eliminator, Pearl Demonators, Mapex Falcons, Mapex Raptors, DW 5000s, even the Yamaha Flying Dragons, you never know what's out there until you do.  I'm a Pearl player myself, and I grew up being a TAMA fan (back before the days of the speed cobra) and hated the idea of owning anything Pearl.  Well, around 1200 dollars later and a couple of sells on ebay, I figured out that feet don't care what's on the pedals, they just care about how they and your ankles feel.  Just go with what feel good, don't limit yourself because of what you see your idols playing or what brand is written on the pedal, and don't be afraid to use those return policies.  EDIT: Made a double statement because I can't proofread for balls."
drums,3d89pg,toxicgarbage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a Speed Cobra guy. If you have the cash, I'd go with the 910. It's going to be your last pedal purchase. They're adjustable so you can get them setup exactly how you want and they're sturdier long term and more road-worthy. The 310 is a good option for home use, lessons and stuff like that. I thought the Pearl Demonator was going to be the best sub ~$100 pedal when they came out, but Tama wasn't having that."

There are also great manufacturers that make higher quality die cast lugs, which to me has a cool vintage look, rather than making more lower quality lugs. Look at the ludwig Acrolite, the Supraphonic(the goddamn legend itself), any drum with tube lugs(many old sonors and premiers). I have to stop because I am getting worked up now.

I'm talking about a single double ended lug on a 16"" deep floor tom or 14"" deep kick drum.   Double lugs are just as classic as single lugs. I believe that older drums that used this layout were also budget minded..take the Ludwig holiday kits for example.   My 60s Niles badge slingerlands are double lugged.   Oh...I also hate tube lugs."

drums,3d6dog,zeeagle,3,Mon Jul 13 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"A large part of that sound is probably the head selection. Obviously those recordings are calfskin heads, which you can still buy from specialists, or there are some more modern equivalents.   There's a company is Sydney, Kentville Drums, who do kangaroo skin heads with that kind of feel, but a lot more durability. Otherwise there's all sorts of stuff from the major manufacturers emulating different properties of those heads.   A big difference is recording style too, those drums didn't necessarily sound exactly like that in the room."

There is this building tension from the piano, and his drummer just plays a snare accent on 2, but it's the tastiest, super groovy thing and it's so different from all the chop heavy stuff that usually gets a mention.

My personal choice though, would be Phil Collins's ""Inside Out.""  The entire song is full of drum solos that don't resolve on one, but rather on the and of two.  The same can be said of the Genesis song ""Mama.""  ""Mama,"" like ""In the Air Tonight,"" is recorded without cymbals (although mama features one cymbal crash during the fade out.)  Collins recorded a lot of songs without cymbals.  It was how he developed such a unique style."

Actually, a few times they did (although I understand why he had to leave). Abe Cunningham. Often has simple ideas that I would have a hard time to come up with.

Sometimes when your starting out, its much better to watch someone whose skills are attainable and has really great groove.  Carter Beauford - I know. He overplays. But for the band he's in I think that's what it needs. He plays the drums like a lead instrument and it's extremely entertaining.  Stewart Copeland - The things that guy does with a groove. I mean it all sounds right, but playing it feels so wrong. I love how deceptively challenging his pieces are."

I guarantee that if carter played in any other genre he would hold it down and Play as consistently as anyone else.

Carl Palmer- Carl used to tear it up back in the day. And puts forth great effort today. Just bombastic solos with a very symphonic approach to the kit.

John Robinson is the perfect mix. He's got incredible technical prowess, some of the most stellar feel and taste you could ever imagine, and he always gets the exact right sound for the song.   He's a tall, lanky, blonde white guy who has layed down some of the most righteous funk grooves in history.  If you listen to Steve Winwood back in the high life, the first minute of that song he plays nothing but hi hat.  Then he adds the kick drum, but he still doesn't even add the snare yet.

I kind of get the not becoming ""corporate shills"" perspective that a lot of musicians have, but man not organizing your workspace...that's just ineptitude on all fronts."
drums,3d6kyn,duccioblock,6,Tue Jul 14 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously. And I feel like a lot of that was kind of just bullshit for TV. Their $895 ""Good"" kit is going to sound as good as their $3,000 ""Best"" kit because at its core its the same drum. Just one has been finished to look like a sports car and that's what you're paying for. The shells are the same, and so long as the put the same care into drilling holes for the lugs and they're tuned well, what's the difference? Edit: unless of course they went with a luan shell or some other type of cheaper wood, but I think the ""prototype"" would be out of the same maple shells they've got lying around  And that Sam Ash rep didn't know shit. Talking about how those corporations have a large artists roster? If there's one thing SJC has done extremely well, its get their kits on the stages of some really popular drummers. If Sam Ash had a <$1000 kit with the SJC badge on it, it would sell like crazy to entry to mid level players who see their favorite drummers playing those kits."
drums,3d6kyn,duccioblock,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing they killed it at was that guys ability to make deals with big artists. Seriously Kudos to him. The issue for them wasn't sales it was margin. Considering they are a custom shop with high service level turn-around for artists, if they had a decent workflow and process improvement lineup from the start they would have been very profitable. I'm not sure the budget lineup is right for SJC. In theory it's good to have a diverse product portfolio  but I don't think these guys will be able to handle the inventory problems that come with the territory(not to mention that it waters down their premium brand because they use the same shells across the board) Large builds and draws on inventory. These guys could be profitable without the shit budget lineup if the focus on turn-around, chip away at costs, and increase price on those projects that require immediate creation. Either way all of this is slightly harder said than done. Hope they make it out alright the more competition the better.  Edit- Damn I just looked at their site, they literally have ""good, better, best"" to describe their lineup. For fucks sake make up some names."

drums,3d6kyn,SenordrummeR2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much investigating he did into other custom shops to determine that they were over charging but not having high enough margins.

These are the same people who want to ticket elderly veterans who fly the American flag on Memorial Day, for crying out loud. Give up.  I wish I were being sarcastic."
drums,3d5tkk,that1guypdx,11,Mon Jul 13 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"When I first moved into my place, I set up my drums, and then before I played, I walked to the neighboring houses and let them know my intentions to play loud instruments, but also my intentions to play at reasonable hours and only on occasion. I also left them my number requesting that they contact me directly first if my playing is disruptive of their day.  In a town home that my buddy just moved out of, he had his drum set in the basement, and the lady next door to him was always calling the police filing complaints. Every time they came they inspected the noise and decided that she was being unreasonable and if she continued to complain then he could file harassment charges on her.  That said, I also used to live in an apartment (before I had my drum set) and the lady next door was filing noise complaints all the time just from us talking (though it was perfectly fine for her to play her trumpet at 7am four times a week). I have a noise complaint on my record from a stupid neighbor when i was living a much quieter life. sometimes things just happen that way.  Some people are impossible to please, and if you can't reason and compromise with them, then unfortunately you need to relocate yourself to people more understanding and tolerant, which isn't always an immediate option.  You haven't specified what type of housing situation you are in, so I'm going to assume you are in a standalone family house that isn't attached to any other building.  Here are a few things you can do:  Firstly, attempt to communicate your attempt to improve the situation with your neighbors by letting them know you intend to minimize the noise, and if they would be willing to be patient while you remedy the situation. (PS, neighbors that like you and respect you are far less likely to complain without discussing it with you first)  If you can afford some drum practice mutes, they reduce volume by a large margin. I'm talking specifically about little foam rings that sit on the top head, and little foam triangles that sit on top of cymbals. They are amazing for volume, but not very great for sound quality, especially the cymbals mutes. You could also use some small pieces of thick fabric and drape those over the cymbals, and I had a friend who recycled old clothing and basically made pillow case style covers for all his drums. It was interesting, and only mildly effective, but sometimes every bit counts.  If you can't afford mutes and aren't necessarily attached to the specific heads and cymbals you have, you can muffle the sounds via duct tape and toilet paper, I've done it before, and while it can have a negative effect on the quality of sound, it does potentially have a decent effect on the volume. Caution though because lifespan of heads and cymbals can potentially be cut shorter due to not being able to vibrate properly.  Another option I've seen and only partially tested myself (very tedious, but worth it in the end) is actually taking off the top heads, and laying a spare piece of cloth inside hanging over the edge of the drum, placing the head back on so that a bit of cloth is hanging out underneath the head with the drum head holding the cloth in its place, with the majority of the cloth inside sitting on top of the bottom head. This will shorten the life of your top head, but I'm uncertain about damage to the drum itsself as I've never seen the long term effects of the solution. I haven't witnessed any damage to the wood or rim of any drums using this method.  Another big factor to volume can be what room in the house the drums are in. noises in basements with concrete walls are far less annoying to neighbors compared to noises in a room with exterior walls made of wood, sound has a much harder time getting out of basements than bedrooms. If you have a room available with no exterior walls, this is going to be your best option.  On a similar note to what room your instruments are in, the items in the room can also help absorb sound. Lots of soft surfaces facing different directions can absorb a whole lot of sound. Its unreasonable to accomplish, but empty egg cartons stacked up around the walls, for example, is a popular theoretical solution because of all the different facing edges and the soft material. Pillows and blankets stacked and hung up all around the room will help. (especially over windows)  Basically the more sound you absorb before the sound gets to an exterior wall the better. combining methods usually helps multiplicatively so the more work you put into lowering the volume of your drums, the better.   Also, good luck!"

It's a bunch of 90 year old busy-bodies who just can't stay the fuck out of other people's business, but won't help if there are actual complaints.  I had someone dump a used diaper in front of my house.  Not even on my property, but on the street in front of my house (I assume they tried to throw it in my trash can and missed).  The HOA said not only would they not pick it up, but it's my responsibility - anything in front of the house up to and including the middle of the street is mine.  There's a reason I'm trying to convince the fiancee that we should just move to a walled-off compound."
drums,3d5tkk,fastballer8,3,Mon Jul 13 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"All these are great suggestions and HOAs totally blow...and I pay to live in one.  One thing I haven't seen mentioned is switching over your kit to mesh heads.  I know Pearl makes some and so do other electric conversion companies like Pintech.  For your cymbals, you could try a product called Cymbomutes.  They look like they work pretty well and I think they're based out of the UK but don't quote me there.  If those are too pricey you can find any other number of cymbal mutes out there.  And finally if nothing else works, just get a Roland or Yamaha electronic kit ;)"
drums,3d5tkk,JehRah,2,Mon Jul 13 22:34:19 2015 UTC,Remo makes meshed heads as well called silent stroke.
drums,3d5tkk,thesesimplewords,3,Tue Jul 14 11:26:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everyone here.  If they're ready to fine you, they will do that the first drum they hear.  They probably don't care if it is fairly quiet or during daylight hours.  They're done and there's no reasoning with them.  I'd recommend electronic drums, but the cheaper ones still make enough noise to go through some walls.  You have to go with mesh to make a difference.  It has already been suggested to try out the mesh heads on your current kit.  That might work.  If nothing else, try taking off your heads, placing a strip of cloth over the drum tightly and tightening the drumhead over it.  Then leave the bottom head off.  It sounds like a Pringles' can, but it is quiet.  They do make plastic cymbals that don't really make much noise....  At least you'd be working on your chops and patterns, even if you can't really tell what you're doing.  Good luck.  I feel your pain.  Been there many times."

drums,3d14vi,Blueburnsred,5,Mon Jul 13 03:09:37 2015 UTC,Beautiful kit man! Wow. I am entranced by that ballad snare though. How big is it? Is there any audio of it? I would LOVE to hear it. Do you use any muffling or does it just not ring much? What kind of stand is it sitting on to be able to go that low? How much did it cost (if you don't mind me asking)? Is it a size option from DW or did you have it custom built to your specs? What head/snare combo have you found to work best on it?
drums,3d14vi,bhsgk012,3,Sun Jul 12 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"That is the 16x10 DW Ballad snare. It's a ""standard"" snare in the sense that you can order it anytime without being an endorser or paying a lot extra. Sekou's however, is of a custom color that he ordered to match the rest of his custom kit.   The stand is a new one by DW, the 9399.   I'm not sure what heads he's using on there now. He changes them too much :) Although, I do know that he will throw an upside-down head on there or an older head that he cuts the rim off of."
drums,3d14vi,DarkNostril,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"bhsgk012 pretty much nailed your question about my ballad. The technique he mentioned with the upside down head is on point, except what I've done is cut away the aluminum ring and just used the rest of the skin. I believe I have a G2 on there right now, but I can't remember what the clear head I have layered on top is."

drums,3d1tpi,GraeyPoupon,3,Mon Jul 13 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. Stave drums are built with angled blocks of wood which are then rounded, like wine barrels.  Here's a stave kit I built in High school (http://imgur.com/a/HeBRI). I'd be happy to try to answer questions if that'd help?"

drums,3d1tpi,ninjastarz808,2,Mon Jul 13 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"I've never actually spent time trying to notice the difference. But the general rule is that glue = dead sound. Plys have lots of glue (between each layer of ply), staves have less (just between each block) and the ultimate is solid shells carved straight from a log (no glue).   Basically less glue = more of the tone of the wood showing through."

drums,3d3n3l,RLightfoot,2,Mon Jul 13 06:52:02 2015 UTC,"When I could bothered to clean em I would use the Paiste Cymbal cleaner & protector on all my brands. good stuff.   in regards to a home remedy, i'm sure you could use a a solution of white vinegar or lemon juice - fairly inoffensive and known for their cleaning properties. google it first though probs."
drums,3d3n3l,birthcanalboy,2,Mon Jul 13 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"Morgan Rose once did an interview with DRUM! or ModernDrummer and talked about cleaning cymbals. He said one thing he didn't think about was all the blood, sweat, and other stuff that had accumulated on his cymbals had changed the sound and were causing the sound he wanted. He cleaned and polished them between shows on a tour, and the polished cymbal sounded terrible (in his eyes) compared to what he had. Note: the sound property of the cymbal didn't change, but the sound he was used to did.  With that said, I've tried the Zildjian cleaner on my Zildjian cymbals (all of my A Customs are brilliant finish), and I didn't find it to be worth the cost. I generally just use a damp non-abrasive cloth to wipe off all of the dust and smudges. Seems to make them shine, and I don't have to worry about any chemicals affecting them. Any kind of abrasive cloth can leave swirls or marks on the cymbals, so be cautious with the cloth you use. I've also read to clean them with the grooves rather than against, but that could be a personal preference thing.  If nothing else, check your manufacturer's recommendations.  http://zildjian.com/Education/Zildjian-101/Cymbal-Care"

Take a wet paper towel and get all of it off and then fry it with a towel or paper towel. Repeat for the bottom."
drums,3d3n3l,im-not-greg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Take a wet paper towel and get all of it off and then fry it   MMMmmm love fried cymbals.  Also, lemons works, though if you are hesitant to squirt lemons juice all over you can simply squeeze the lemons into a bit of warm water and use a cloth to scrub the cymbal.  Using a fabric similar to toilet paper or coffee filter to dry will leave it extra shiny without leaving any fibers behind."
drums,3d3n3l,TheUnclescar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:34:34 2015 UTC,Oh haha I meant dry. Oops. But yeah I've never cleaned my cymbals with anything else. It works well.
drums,3d3n3l,im-not-greg,2,Tue Jul 14 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. As they age and get dirty, they will change shape a bit in the sound department. But they won't sound worse if you clean them. I have certain cymbals that I will actually clean and some I will leave dirty, but for the most part they all get a spiff up every few weeks! They WILL NOT SOUND BAD IF YOU CLEAN THEM, they'll just be a bit brighter. Which is why I keep mine clean !   Just make sure to not scrub the logos.  They will come off!"

drums,3d3n3l,drumsareneat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:22:12 2015 UTC,Do you have proof? In my experience it does change the sound.
drums,3d3n3l,drbhrb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:00:52 2015 UTC,"It won't change the sound properties, but it will change the sound you are used to. The clean cymbal will have a clean sound because it won't have dust and other crap that is limiting the vibration that causes the cymbals to ring. In other words, they will sound closer to the cymbal when you purchased it."
drums,3d3n3l,SenordrummeR2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"It can change the sound, using some cleaners or to much elbow grease will remove a fine layer of bronze"
drums,3d3n3l,theothernameplate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"The main thing that will change the sound of the cymbal is more of the acidity on your hands & fingers after touching it.   Look at the underside of the cymbal and you'll see all your finger prints.  It's ""dulling"" your cymbal tone, which is sometimes desirable to people (such as my vintage 1970's zildjian) but my A Customs I like to keep them bright as possible so I'll clean all the sweat, finger grease, dust and random shit that accumulates after some time."

There is a very large range of variation from one example to the next, and unless you can hear the cymbal in person, I think it would be a huge potential time sink to blindly buy and return a bunch trying to find one you really like.  We don't turn cymbals down subjectively; we understand that everybody has different expectations of what a ride should sound like. But we will turn them away for genuinely unpleasant sonic flaws or obvious QC issues. Could be dissonant overtones, an overbearing tonal character (for example a SUPER low pitched Vintage Bliss ride), or some other factor such as a clangy crash cymbal or hi-hats that don't close all the way. Our general approach is that if it plays or sounds like a low-end cymbal, we turn it away. We think that Dreams should be affordable, but not disappointing.  That being said, even though we curate our selection we're still bound to have a bunch you won't like. Everyone has a different expectation of what a good crash/ride should sound like. Dreams are very obviously hand-made, but while it has advantages, there are also disadvantages to that process."

This is their response:   Hey DaneboJones, With any handmade piece of art there will be slight differences from cymbal to cymbal - I feel like that complaint is really dated and we have come leaps and bounds in terms of consistency    for our pies the last several years. We don't churn our and mass produce the exact same cymbal, our hand hammering means hand hammering! - I hope this helps and makes your more comfortable ordering online! - Let me know if you have any other questions!

Sometimes drum sets come with these things, sometimes they don't. If you're buying a new set, lower-end entry kits usually include the necessary hardware (and sometimes cymbals).  If you're buying used, you'll need to pay attention to the details of every purchase you're thinking about making.  Oh, and try to avoid ultra-cheap stuff like First Act.

As you get better you can move into different subdivisions. Then I would start doing different patterns on each foot ex: 8ths on the left foot and quarter notes on the right. Always take it slow first and work up to your max speed. Work with a metronome if you feel your tempo fluctuating. Also don't bore yourself. It may just be a pad but there is so much variation to venture into with the rudiments, accents, dynamics, inversions. Good luck and keep practicing!"

drums,3czpe4,Yeast000,2,Sun Jul 12 16:18:49 2015 UTC,I am always okay with stick tricks and flair like this provided that the actual drumming is tight. I'd never complain about Thomas Lang showboating in this way but your drummer should first pay attention to his dynamics and the feel of his swing. His time keeping isn't terrible but he's definitely rushing some parts of the track. I'd also like to see some of his coordination being directed towards using that left foot.  He's definitely a decent drummer but he could be a lot better if he focused his efforts on actually playing the drums.

But, you're paying for instruction, so you should  absolutely feel free to suggest that its time to learn something more complex.   Also consider trying out other teachers, regardless of whether or not you feel you're being challenged.   Drum teachers are as unique as drumming styles, some will be more suited to what you feel is your individual style.  Think of it like your favorite tee shirt. If they don't do the job, you get rid of them.    Most of them fit, some of them are your favorite colors.  But there's always one that is your favorite, It has the style you like, it's the right color and the right fit.    Next year, it'll be replaced by your new favorite."

drums,3cyt4v,dempsteroni,2,Sun Jul 12 05:50:30 2015 UTC,"As a tutor it can take a while to settle into lessons and for your tutor to fully figure you out too but might be an idea to talk to the tutor just to make sure you're on the same page. Having taught other self taught drummers, I've had to take them back to basics to unlearn bad habits and plenty have thought they were completing exercises perfectly when there were massive mistakes/terrible technique so make sure you're listening closely to feedback on the exercises"

Up the tempo as you're able to play faster being relaxed as possible.  When you reach the actual tempo of the song, you'll find yourself able to play faster without hurting, and that's because you'll be relaxed even though you're playing at a fast speed.   It's all about practice.  If you practice, you will play it.  If you book them, they will come."

drums,3czu5j,fastballer8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:17:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, what u/toxicgarbage said.  It's a matter of endurance because that's a pretty blistering song.  I had the same problem when I was learning to cover Everlong.  Play the parts at a tempo you're comfortable with and play it till you can do so without even thinking about it.  Then bump up the metronome a few bpm till you're slightly uncomfortable with it and play it forever till that becomes comfortable and relaxed.  Repeat and repeat.  This won't come overnight and as you approach those higher tempos you may only be able to increase 1-2 bom at a time.  Don't feel bad but this is just how progress goes.    Now I should probably follow my own advice and not get so frustrated when I'm not progressing 10 bpm a day!"

drums,3cwvfh,spiffyP,3,Tue Jul 14 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"This is an old issue that plagues many players. Like Tony Royster, I've been lucky enough to study with some of the greats, and so I can share a little bit of insight.  I started playing the drums in my twenties, I was already an established studio pianist, which enabled me to pick up a lot of things from the drummers I had worked with.  Anyway, one of the interesting things that I learned from a studio player was about synapses in the brain, and how most players simply build up the channels that they encounter most often, ie, playing the hi-hat of the ride with their right hand, snare with their left, kick with their right, and so on.  So he had me sit down and play 16th note paradiddles with my hands.  OK, easy.  Lrll Rlrr, etc.  Now, he told me to play paradiddles with my feet, also pretty easy.  As I was doing that, he told me to feel how I had to balance myself on the throne.  Of course, in doing paradiddles with my feet, my arms were able to balance me.  So now he had me play 8th note paradiddles with my feet, well I was playing 16th note paradiddles with my hands.  Doing that immediately threw my balance, and threw my brain for a loop. Suddenly, I was forced to properly align myself, and balance myself on the throne so that all four limbs were equally mobile.  That was really when I started to begin to feel and understand the concept of four way independence.  In order to play the overlapping paradiddles, you had to play right hand with the right foot, right hand with the left foot, left hand with the right foot, and left hand with the left foot.  Not only that, you had to do double strokes as you increase tempo, both in the hands and the feet.  So, after doing that just once, my brain really started to open up new pathways, and I began to notice changes, my feet were getting used to operating in between strokes, against the opposite hand, against the opposite foot, and so on.  Suddenly my brain was more free to process what needed to be happening, not trying to coordinate it.  Here's the exersize:  Start with both hands on the snare, and the feet on two sides of a double kick pedal, or on a kick and hi hat if you don't have a double kick.  I'll explain each 8th note by count.  The hands play 2 notes for every note the foot plays.  Count/feet/hands  1/R/RL  +/L/RR  2/R/LR  +/R/LL  3/L/RL  +/R/RR  4/L/LR  +/L/LL  As you can see, no two 8th notes are the same.  Each one forces you to play a unique combination.  After you learn this, you can start to mix it up, play triplets, right left on the hands, then right on the foot for the third of the triplet.  The next three notes would be right right with the hands, and left with the foot.  You can also flip the hands and feet, and play the feet as 16ths, and the hands as 8ths.  Anyway, once you start doing stuff like this, your brain will become much more efficient at sequencing."

drums,3cxb89,Pracyon,3,Sat Jul 11 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"Snares can be very tricky. The first step is tuning the drum with the snares released. If it doesn't sound good with the snares off then there is a high probability that it will not sound good with the snares on.   Next, make sure the snare wire is hanging parallel/flat from the bottom head. The pressure from uneven snares will not apply even tension on the resonant head, in turn causing buzz. Be sure that your strainer is at about half tension when setting the wires, to allow room for loosening and tightening once they are against the head.  Once the snares are on, trust your ears. Too jangly? Tighten them up. Too choked? Loosen them.   You had mentioned tuning the resonant head fairly tight. That isn't a bad move but it will make the snare sound more pronounced in the overall sound. That, itself, could be what made the buzzing obvious. Also, be sure that none of your other drums are tuned to the same pitch as your other drums. That way, you will avoid sympathetic vibrations between drums.  I hope this helps to some degree, let me know if you have any further questions!"
drums,3cxb89,El_Donks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent answer. I would also check that none of the snare wires are damaged or stretched out. This could leave a loose wire to buzz while the others are tight. It might be a good idea to take a break after trying to tune it for a while, you can suffer hearing fatigue which will make you overcompensate and keep tuning the drums higher and higher for example. It's always good to listen with fresh ears. The size and shape of the room can also come into play. If the buzz isn't too bad I wouldn't worry about it. It might be prominent when you are just hitting a tom for instance, but once you are actually playing it will get lost in the mix."
drums,3cxb89,PeaceForce,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:16:00 2015 UTC,A lot of drummers tune the resonant head a fifth note higher than the batter head. You can give that a shot. You can also try loosening or tightening the four tension rods around the snare bed itself. But only do this if the advice in the comment below this doesn't work.

drums,3cxfso,clipperdylan6,9,Sat Jul 11 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know personally; I don't really have any feelings about him.  But a few months ago someone here posted a link to his Facebook page where he was crying about being denied medical service (I think in the UK) for something very minor in favor of patients who had serious life threatening injuries.  He was crying because he had a show to play and bashed the medical staff for not bowing down to him and his celebrity status.  Then when people started defending the medical staff on his FB page, he got super douchey and started blocking everyone who didn't agree with him.  Not sure if that link still exists anywhere but it was pretty entertaining.  That being said, he's infinitely more talented than me so I can't hate on his abilities."
drums,3cxfso,fastballer8,8,Sat Jul 11 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"He is a douche.  I've met him,  several of my friends have met him, one even knew him back in his time with a group called inner sanctum and ran into him again after BCSL and said he turned into a self absorbed man child.  Also, another reason would be that every time Portnoy is challenged people bring up the Dance of Eternity, 6:00, Metropolis or something.  You don't even need to be technically gifted to play those, you just have to have good single strokes and be good at counting.  He's just a guy that's literally done the same thing since Images and Words and relied on the band instead of himself to change the musical context, and he still does the same thing.  MP is who got me wanting to play when I was younger though, so I'll give him that, but after playing for a few years and practicing rudiments and exploring different styles of playing, he isn't the phenom his supporters claim him to be, which his community of followers could be a close #3 of why people groan when he's mentioned."
drums,3cxfso,toxicgarbage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"""He's done the same thing since Images and Words""  How is this true? He has consistently come up with interesting parts that the music doesn't necessarily dictate. And he's played with several different groups and different styles, from an instrumental jazz fusion/prog band (LTE) to a bluesy old school rock band (Winery Dogs), and has covered albums from Pink Floyd to Metallica to Rush, Zeppelin, The Who etc. Doesn't sound like doing the same thing to me."
drums,3cxfso,toxicgarbage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"Well, break down everything he does from a technical aspect.  Single strokes and double bass fills up and down a massive kit, just in different time signatures.  You say he comes up with parts the music doesn't dictate also, which is true, but he did nothing but the same stuff he did in DT in his work with LTE.  I mean I get that its jazz fusion and progressive, but jazz fusion doesn't call for double bass fills.  I prefer Bill Bruford and Sean Reinert's work with Gordian Knot if you'd like a comparison (I think the song Muttersprache would be a good fit, it's the most similar to LTE).  It's almost like no matter where he's at besides his cover work (where he aims to emulate those he is covering), he's competing with the guitarist or keyboard for the spotlight.  His work with the Winery Dogs is a lot more laid back,  but that may also be because the band in general is more laid back.   Plus, his entire career with DT, LTE, Transatlantic, etc. He doesn't seem to have advanced his playing at all.  Everything he showed up with to record WDADU is exactly the same thing (save for the blast beat) that showed up to record BCSL...he just had a bigger kit.  If you want to listen to and adore him, by all means do so, but don't flip out when you ask someone why they don't like the guy or his work that much for reasons of taste or technique.  I don't aim to debate or twist anyone's temper about it, but that's just how I see it, and I guess I'm not alone in that."
drums,3cxfso,toxicgarbage,0,Sun Jul 12 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"I would agree that he relies too much on double bass sometimes. I would check out his playing here: https://youtu.be/WUoUim7WGwo  No double bass, very tasteful.  He has some faults, but I think there are other guys (looking at you, Lars) who deserve way more hate.  You say that he always does the same double bass fills, but couldn't you also say that Bonham always does the same hand/foot triplet fills? Everyone has some kind of go-to fill. Bottom line: I don't like to hate on other drummers. Portnoy is still way more talented and creative than a lot of prominent drummers. Music isn't a competition- if his drumming inspires me and sounds good I say he's doing the job fine."

He is fantastic regardless of his personality. I think that his ability is pretty inspirational. If I practice every day, eight hours a day, for let's say five years, I could probably play everything that he has played. There are some other drummers( like dean castronovo, mike Mangini, Virgil donati(even though I generally do not like him) and countless others that I believe I could practice every day for the rest of my life and never even touch their abilities.

I love pretty much everything I've heard him play on before he left Dream Theater including Transatlantic and Liquid Tension Experiment.  However once he left Dream Theater everything I have heard him play on has been much less exciting. I'm sure that he is satisfied with what he's doing but hearing him playing the complex and interesting music that he was on.   DT has been very much different without him. For better or worse, that's up to you.   In terms of haters being asked to play through the difficult and insane piece that is The Dance of Eternity, that's a ridiculous argument. I can dislike Elvin Jone's playing without being able to play a lick of it, and enjoy Tony Williams' while still marveling at the depth and skill of his playing.   I want to believe that Mike Portnoy is just the goof i've seen him portrayed as in the videos I have seen, the performances I've seen and the way his playing makes me feel.

drums,3cs9rr,carrot0101,49,Fri Jul 10 13:51:56 2015 UTC,"Sure it's a joke but it's a joke based on the circlejerk of this sub that metal is somehow the underling of the drumming world, that metal drummers are only about fast technique and blast beats while simultaneously only ever posting pics of basic kits and ad-nauseam comments about 'keeping in the groove' while playing simple beats to pop & rock songs."
drums,3cs9rr,Lethal_Papercut,40,Fri Jul 10 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"I think what bothers me the most is that people make the jokes, but only because they don't have a deep understanding of metal as a genre. There are so many sub-genres, and different styles of playing within metal, and they are all discounted because the djent/metalcore/deathcore genres have risen to such mainstream popularity nowadays. Yes, some metal sucks, but some of it is really, REALLY good. If you don't like it fine. But i hear so many people make fun of it, it's unreal. No one says it has to be your favorite, but if i posted a ""Jazz Kit,"" as a joke, i would get crucified and downvoted to hell. its a pretty shitty double standard."

I thought when I joined this sub it would be actual discussion about drumming technique and whatnot but really it's picture posts of lame ass kits with some delusional title. I'm convinced all the hate on metal here is because most people can't play it. Unless you've been living under a no-metal rock for the last 15 years, metal drumming in general isn't the stereotype technique that this sub would have you think it is. There's been a serious renaissance in what metal drumming is these days but this sub doesn't want to acknowledge it. I've tried pointing it out before with a post or two about Tuomo Latvala from Hateform in particular because his phrasing is so much different than ""typical metal"" but no one here seems to give a shit really."

Get over it kids. Nobody cares that you play metal. Nobody cared when I did it. It's just something you play. In general, people who limit themselves to one Genre are NOT well rounded players. Most of the metal heads I played with were single track - often with their heads way up their asses, but hiding that behind the veil of the tortured artist - so dedicated to an unappreciated form that they didn't have to look at themselves through an honest lens.   It's not that metal players aren't good, it's that nobody feels bad for you because you decided to limit yourself to one style. In fact, it's less deserving of respect. Metal snobs, jazz snobs, it's all the same. There's no one true form, expand your horizons and quit bitching  about how someone doesn't like what what you do.   When you whine about it, it just makes you look worse. It has nothing to do with how good you are or whatever. Go make a metal - drum sub if that's what you wanna see. Most working drummers know better than to haul out 14 cymbals and a 9 piece kit. It's a waste of time and energy.   Nobody looks down on metal players.... nobody cares what you do.  Nobody ever attacks you guys, you just like to think you're being attacked so that you can feel special.   Get over yourselves. We're all just here to play."

Are you really that dense? You can't see the absurdity of your statement there?  You'd be better served sitting st your kit and doing some work than being in proximity to a keyboard and attempting to clack-out a rational argument.

drums,3cwj28,Mtard31,7,Sat Jul 11 11:17:17 2015 UTC,I pieced together my v kit with parts from eBay.  It's going to be the most cost effective way than buying everything new together.  You can use any of the Roland TD/CY cymbal and drum pieces.  All you have to do is tell the brain what trigger it is and assign it accordingly a sound.  You can even use other brand triggers.
drums,3cwj28,xeon65,5,Sat Jul 11 12:01:08 2015 UTC,This.  This is the best advice you could get.  I did the same thing with my kit and it's a pretty monster frankenkit at the moment.  Also Yamaha cymbals will work too and are generally cheaper than the Roland models.  Not sure about the hats tho.

The heads and cymbals are slightly smaller and not chrome. The K does have one less tom, but you can buy that separately if you really want it. There's a port for it on the brain. And there's the high hat difference as you mentioned. That is one thing I eventually want to upgrade.    As far as space goes. That's about 6 feet across and the throne sticks out about 5 feet from the wall.    Another thing to keep in mind is that you have to buy the high hat stand, kick peddle, and throne separately. Let me know if you have any other questions."

drums,3ctlt4,DanCarlson,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"I've found them to be a little more subdued with a softer feel under your stuck.   Source: play vintage A's, have played vintage emps."
drums,3ctlt4,elroso,2,Fri Jul 10 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"Little less expressive (less sustain) than normal Ambs, little more than Emps (which just came off after a year). A cool in-between head. I really like them so far."
drums,3ctlt4,steverocksvh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I currently play regular coated Emperors over Ambs.   I find the Emps need a good whack to get them going and don't sound so good a lower volumes. The Ambs sounds better at lower volume although have more high overtones, I also think they sound boxy when hit harder.  Will give these a try next time I swap heads."

drums,3ctlt4,steverocksvh,2,Fri Jul 10 22:03:22 2015 UTC,Yeah! Best drum shop on the west coast. They just started carrying their logo-ed heads so I thought it was a good time to swap. You play around town with anyone?
drums,3ctlt4,steverocksvh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their logo heads are Remo's though and I just recently decided that I will never buy Remo's ever again. Their coating wears off way faster than any other brand and any multi ply heads get major air pockets that make the head sound like a wet paper bag.   The Revival sticks are make by Vater and those are pretty solid.   I play drums for a band called Pity Fucks mostly. I have also sat in for other bands and have also played in multiple Halloween cover bands for the last few years. Those being a Radio Birdman tribute band called Radio Bloodbath and a Saints tribute band thats I can't remember the name of. I am retarded. Thats why I play the drums."

The kit is dead as hell, in a cool rock and roll way."
drums,3cvfen,fayt67,3,Sat Jul 11 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"That was the technique I used from the beginning, so it's completely natural for me. Maybe in the beginning it felt a little awkward, I can't really remember.  Just keep practicing it and employing it into all aspects of your playing, not just rolls or fills.  As for the sticks sliding, unless someone has mastered the art of this technique to where their sticks don't slide, just get used to it. It's normal. As you progress and get used to this style, you'll find they move less in your playing. When it happens to me, I just relieve some pressure from the sticks while playing so that they slide down my hand and back to a better position. I don't even think about it, and most of the time I don't really notice that I do it, it just becomes a natural correction, like slightly adjusting the wheel of a car if you're drifting in your lane too much to one side.  So just keep the technique going and employ it into every aspect of your playing. There's no miracle trick or fix.  Best of luck."
drums,3cv7cv,xxxMrKitexxx,2,Sat Jul 11 01:21:48 2015 UTC,All things being equal get Roland.  IMHO they seem much more popular so you'd be able to find spare parts and add to your kit...
drums,3cv7cv,BenMelanin,2,Sat Jul 11 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"You're really not gonna find anything comfortable (or that can do rimshot) at that price range.  It's just the nature of electric drums, it seems  It sucks...I spent $600 on the TD-1K so I could play at college and it feels like utter shit compared to my real kit that I spent only $200 more on.   But the Roland is absolutely better than the Simmons, and the brand is more respected.   You can upgrade the snare on the TD-1K to one that can handle shots but it costs $200 extra IIRC"
drums,3cv7cv,Dent18,2,Sat Jul 11 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"Well, first things first, how many years have you been playing for?  If you're not really sure whether or not you'll stick with drums because you're new, then get the TD-1K.  If you're an experienced player, I'd say save up for a TD-11 or TD-15 kit.  With the two kits you mentioned, neither can hit snare rim shots since there aren't two separate triggers on the snare drum pads.  When it comes to response time, you shouldn't have to worry about that.  Also, Simmons isn't the most reputable company at the moment when it comes to electronic kits.  Roland and Yamaha are the companies to look at right now for ekits (I place Roland over Yamaha from personal experience though).  Now for comfort. This topic is a bit more complicated because it really depends on how you want your kit setup.  With the two kits you mentioned, you don't have a lot of variation with where you can place the drums, especially on the TD-1k, I've actually seen people complain that the kit can be extremely uncomfortable because of how squished together everything is on that kit.  Anyways, the more you spend, the more options you'll have for where you can place the drums, the number of drums and cymbals you can have, since the drum stands tend to be higher quality.  For example, the Roland TD-30kv comes with a metal stand that is pretty big and has extra components that add more options.  So in the end to answer your question, I'd buy the TD-1K because it's newer and will most likely have better sound quality compared to the Simmons, but you should know that your options are limited on a kit like that, so saving up may be a better decision.  Also look on craigslist, tons of people are selling electronic drums they bought, but barely used."

Even though you may not use those different kinds of strokes in your normal playing, practicing them will help refine how your hands sustain and be more efficient with the rebound of the stick.  2) Ergonomics.  There's a link in the sidebar.  3) Exercises.  Use a metronome, find a pdf of stick control or the new breed and practice exercises that emphasize the left hand.  With the metronome, you know specifically at what tempo you're being challenged, so you can work at being comfortable in certain tempos."

drums,3cv4f0,Lan_lan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue. A good way to grasp the motion for higher tempos (160+) is to treat it like leg bouncing. I don't know if you do it, but personally I bounce my legs a lot. And fast double bass uses almost the same motion. Your feet should not really  leave the pedal. The ball of your foot should be about midway on the pedal, Your foot should be parallel to the floor and you tap hinging at your ankle (tips of your legs stay relatively motionless (shaking up and down slightly). If you are a leg bouncer as well, Try letting your legs bounce on the pedals and then try to take control of the motion. This is how I got used to that motion and broke the speed barrier. Sadly, it's something that can be explained to you many times but until it clicks for you and your feel it yourself it will still be difficult to grasp. Hope this helps!"
drums,3cv4f0,FormidableDrummer,2,Sat Jul 11 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the bouncing in a little more detail? Like what muscles do what, what joints should be moving, etc. And thanks for the reply!"
drums,3cv4f0,FormidableDrummer,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure. So you are going to be ""bouncing"" your leg on he ball of your foot. Most of the motion is going to be ankle joint motion. To relate it to your hands, think of moving your whole leg for a regular bass hit as a wrist stroke and using your ankle is like using your back fingers. The main muscles you'll feel it in with the bouncing are your Tibias Anterior (on the front outer side of your lower leg) and your Soleus (long flat muscle under and slightly lower than your calf), as those are the muscles that aid in point your foot down and lifting it back up. So what youll do is have the ball of your foot on the pedal, and then press down on the pedal using your ankle (Not your whole leg) and lift it back up and repeat. Try not to let the ball of your foot leave the pedal. I hope that helps more!"

drums,3cu2e5,that1guypdx,3,Sat Jul 11 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I play with a 24x18 PDP MXR bass drum. I've got Remo Powerstroke 3 on the batter side with a kick shield/pad, and Remo Ebony Ambassador head on the front with two 6"" vents. It's got a really deep, dark punch that you can feel without adding pillows. I've always thought the EMAD dampened the sound too much, but I've never tried the Super Kick 1."
drums,3cu2e5,SenordrummeR2,2,Sat Jul 11 00:17:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I would go for the last two. EMAD's are good for lots of attack and little sustain so you can't get a lot of boom out of them. The super kick and powerstroke 3 however can achieve a boomy sound since they tend to give more sustain. If you want a boomy, huge sound, go for those. If you want pure punch and attack, go for the EMAD"
drums,3cu2e5,DontClapOn1and3,2,Fri Jul 10 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"I worked in music stores for years and the skin you use and how it's tuned as a single contributing factor to a desired tone is a huge percentage of how to get the sound you want. Kicks that came out of the box with EMADs always had the big deep punchy sounds while the other two had more overtones and breathy qualities as the dampening used for Remo and Aquarians isn't as... severe?  Based on what your after, EMAD will give the most deep punch out of the 3 options. Powerstroke 3 will likely have the most ""sustain"" and the aquarium will be in the middle but especially if you use the two ply EMAD, it will be huge punch and no breathy over tones or sustain. Hope this helps."
drums,3cu2e5,TheDrumHQ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I tune my heads just above wrinkling on both sides for my kick. I had a Superkick 1 for my birch 22x16 Ludwig Accent and it was alright, but I also had an Aquarian Regulator for the reso and a pillow inside so it became too quiet to compete with the rest of my kit, which was unmuffled. So I'll probably go for the EMAD."
drums,3cu2e5,TheDrumHQ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Nice. Yeah, the EMADs have this bottom end that I haven't found another kick skin will deliver. Cheers."
drums,3cu2e5,jdbrew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"What is the alderwood like? Is it more in line with a less rosonant harder wood like oak, of a resonant warm tone like maple? Or the kind of nuetral poplar sound? I'm not super familiar with it.  I have a maple 14"" x 24"", with a coated Remo Power Stroke 3 batter and a Fiberskyn reso. I have never had a coated batter kick drum head, or a power Stroke 3 batter head; I've always been a fan of the Aquarian Super Kicks. I had the EMAD adjustable dampening head for a while on my old kit but ultimately liked the Aquarians best. When I bought this new kit, the PS3/Fiberskyn was the combination the guy had on it before me and I said I was going to change and he told me this combo was the best he found for this drum. I had never had a large kick drum before. and id also never had a shallow kick so i really needed to experiment. After spending way too much money, I ended up coming back to this combination. I have the small EMAD pillow in it, but nothing else. And did Port the reso. And the Fiberskyn reso is money. It makes the drum sound so warm. I had the standard remo black reso for a while and it just sounded plasticky. The Aquarians Superkick sounded a little too dead in it for me. But with your deeper 24"" it might be fine. I dunno. It's hard to make a decision without buying a few and trying them out. If you've got the cash, I would suggest doing that, buy a few batter, buy a few resos, set them up with varying combinations and record it on your phone, go back and listen and pick your favorite, then sell the heads on Craigslist for 80% of the list price. You'll lose a bit but it might be worth it."

drums,3cthxw,JetSandals,3,Fri Jul 10 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"I've never played on anything other than standard 20 strand snares, but I'm pretty sure higher strands give you more sensitivity, and a somewhat fatter less ringy tone."
drums,3cthxw,CaptainMatt13,5,Fri Jul 10 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"more snare sound, including sympathetic buzz. not necessarily sensitivity because that has mostly to do with tuning, and snare adjustment.. though it will be more snarey sounding in general, with less body, which imo lessens the fatness .. though its tough to really describe..  i've tried 16 strand wires, and those were just as sensitive, but the drum was definitely less dry, aka more ringy.. with a more subtle snare crack that let more of the body of the drum come through.  more of a vintage tone, vibe.   the deeper your snare, the more i think it would benefit from having more snare wires ."
drums,3cthxw,OneHighGiraffa,2,Fri Jul 10 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"+1 to the points made by both /u/CaptainMatt13 and /u/OneHighGiraffa. That's exactly what I would say to expect by upping the wire count.   If I could add something for OP though, I'd make a subtle change first. You'd be surprised how much difference 4 strands makes one way or the other (both from 20 to 16 and from 20 to 24)."
drums,3cthxw,DarkNostril,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:25 2015 UTC,";D   good point, on make a subtle change first.  Also, Guitar Center and other big name shops have pretty decent return policies, under which I think snare wires would qualify. So hopefully you can try them, and return/exchange if you think you want something different."

drums,3cthxw,mandalore237,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"A simple way it was put to me when I asked this question, the fewer snares under a snare, the more of the sound of the drum you'll hear. The more wires, the less drum you'll hear.   Look at yamaha's signature Steve Gadd model. 8 strand wires (last I checked). The snare sound is present, but no where close when compared to the same drum strung up with 30's or 42's. Then you really get more of that sympathetic buzz and snap playing the drum, as mentioned in previous comments.   But also, consider the width of the snare bed on the bottom of the drum. As long as your snare wires aren't wider than the bed of your snare, then you're free to put any snares on it. The only catch is of your snare bed is narrow and deep (which isn't super popular on a snare as it limits your wire options) there are companies like puresound that offer double wrapped (Called ""Twisted"") snare 20's so you have 40 wires with the width of 20.   Just a couple considerations."

Your cymbals will last you longer and they sound better if you get the higher lines from any company really. For example K's, Byzance series, HHX, and lots more personally i love Istanbul and Ziljdian cymbals and the Zildjian A line is very affordable and very well sounding."

I toured for a while using only Dream cymbals and my FOH guy complained about lack of volume..or specifically body .. having to eq them quite extensively to try to get more weight to them. I switched over to Zidjians almost two years ago (using the K Light 22 and Constantinople Medium Thin Low 22 as rides) and the K Dark line for crashes (K Light 16 inch hihat) and there is a big difference. Not knocking Dream.. as I still have a few and I love them and think they are a great company.. but they don't sound exactly like Z's. Not even close.

drums,3cpx4h,2tidesaday,5,Thu Jul 9 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"Since you have an electric kit, something that no one else has mentioned yet is that you could record a beat on your kit's brain, like with a hi-hat groove and maybe one other piece, and then play it back and play over it with snare and bass and whatever else you want to throw in there. I do that sometimes on my electric kit and it works well and is fun."

drums,3cpx4h,2tidesaday,3,Thu Jul 9 22:29:25 2015 UTC,You're welcome. Since you are new to the electric drums I will tell you a tip that took me a while to figure out. You can change the sensitivity if the drum pads if you go into the advanced options. This really helped me a lot with the hi-hat and snare. I am now able to play much faster beats on the hi-hats since I just really only want to tap them instead of having to really bang them to get a sound and I turned it up on the snare to help with ghost notes. Much better imo.
drums,3cpx4h,Jamesfastboy,4,Thu Jul 9 22:34:33 2015 UTC,There's a band called Slaves where the singer is the drummer and he does everything with one tom and one snare and two cymbals and he does everything standing which could easily be done sitting as well.

I've never used one, but can you set the floor tom to sound like a bass drum? Then you can play some rock beats, but just using your hands to play the bass drum."

drums,3cqc3t,jazz-box,9,Thu Jul 9 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"Just... anything? Alright, some of these might not be hacks, but random alterations for different timbres:  -Lamp pull-chain (the stuff that hangs down from your ceiling fan/light) makes for a great removable sizzle cymbal sound. Cut it to length or just wrap it around over the top of the felt until you get it to the right length. Make sure it doesn't hang over the edge of the cymbal; it should juuust reach the edge or be just an inch or two short of it.  -You can cut old heads into dampening rings to go around the edge of your current head.  -Not so much a hack as DIY, but you can make Hot Rods and other types of mallets pretty easily. As you can tell I'm not big on aesthetics, heh.   The hot rods in that picture are 7 - 3/16"" dowels cut to length, with 1 in the middle and 6 wrapped around that one in a hexagon. Should, uh, be pretty self-explanatory, but there's a video if you really need it. Big thing: make sure you sand the ends until they're rounded. I made that mistake and chewed off the coating of my snare head with lots of train beats.  The other pair of mallets there, which are more for the percussion side of things, are made of a couple 3/8"" dowels glued with outdoor adhesive into some wooden balls from the craft store with pre-drilled 3/8"" holes. Does it look stupid? Maybe, but I like them a lot. I wouldn't use them in a pit setting, but they work great for recording quick glockenspiel parts and even some lighter concert tom work. You could do the same with superballs if you wanted a rubber mallet for glock, woodblock, etc.  -Try different stick combinations. Brush and stick, rod and brush, two sticks per hand, even a tambourine or shaker in the right hand with a stick in the left hand can create different textures. Don't force it, but know when each might be appropriate.   Like I said, not all of them are hacks, just different ideas. Use at your own risk."

Use some small pipe clamps on the legs as stop locks. Same height and angle every time.

drums,3cqc3t,jendrok,3,Fri Jul 10 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"Not all ""hacks"" but also some good drumming pro tips.   Those rad little gummy rubber hands you get in vending machines are cheap Moon Gels and be purchased at your local grocery store for next to nothing. Hihats are just two cymbals. Mix and match to desired effect. Ideas: two crash cymbals (16 or 18), two splash cymbals (8 or 10), normal hihat top on a 14 or 16 china, etc. Be clever, stand out. Stick bags usually have something on them like hooks or string to tie to floor toms. Use this. Buy extra hi hat clutches, leave one in your car. For that matter, always have extra felts, sleeves, strings, etc. Never know. Gaff tape on the bass drum hoop helps contain bass pedal damage or near the top to keep your snare off your hoop. Rack toms sound different when suspended from your cymbal stand or when racked in a snare basket. Tune accordingly. You can also manipulate the tom on the snare basket to make minimal contact between the arms and the bottom rim to help with resonance.  Lamp chains, dog tag chains, or even a key ring with some metal stuff on it will work just fine as a sizzle if you need it in a pinch. Bungee cords make lugging gear a little easier. Wrap around stands, drums, etc. Electrical tape can be used to mark stands so you get the same height every time. Useful for when friends are helping set up. Buy a cheap rug and keep it with your stuff. You can roll your hardware inside of it for easy transportation and then set up your stuff right on top. Drums and cymbals usually have serial numbers on them. Keep these on you during gigs and have pictures of your gear on your phone in case something walks away. Drink water. I practice with larger sticks (5Bs) and play with light sticks (7As). Kind of like swinging a baseball bat with the donut on it before you hit. You can use electrical tape to color-code the butts of your sticks so you can easily identify them while they're in your bag. Example, I use one black stripe on my Sweet Rides, two black stripes on my Studios, and one black and one white for my Promark 7As."

drums,3cq5ww,Velocicrappper,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good cymbals are hugely expensive  and will eventually be the priciest parts of your kit.  But the other hand, if you take care of them, they can last decades, and only sound better as time goes on.   My cymbals alone cost me over $1k, but it is SO worth it.    As for the drums, a little boppy kit like the Breakbeats is not a great choice for the kind of music you are wanting to play.  That's a tiny kit for gigging and it's not going to do well for 80s rock because of the tiny shell sizes.  Will it DO it?  Of course.  But it's not ideal and I honestly don't think you will be happy with it if you are planning on playing lots of rock.  I have two kits, one of which is a smaller bop kit with an 18"" bass drum which is still bigger than the Breakbeats.  It does just ok for rock but works better for funk, fusion and jazz (which is mostly what I use it for).  My other kit is a 5 piece with a 22"" bass drum and it's much better for straight rock.    I'd look for used kits on craigslist (lots of used gear at Guitar Center/similar too if you have one in your area).  Look for something with at least a 20"" bass drum."

Are you getting only hihats though? No crash or ride?  In terms of sticks there's so much subjectivity that all the advice I can give is to try a lot of different sizes. 5A and 5B are the most commonly found sizes for general rock purposes so start there. Break a pair, buy different sticks. Eventually you'll learn what kind of sticks best fit you."

The breakbeats kit isn't necessarily too small for rock. You might get some funny looks (and some people here might comment that it's too quiet) but it will work.  If you're talking about sticks, 5A and 5B are totally fine (and I'd even say they're pretty standard) for rock. Personally, I use 5A's. I used to use 747's (which are the same diameter as 5A's but longer) but switched to the 5A's a few years ago. 5B's are a little too thick for my taste and 2B's are drumhead destroyers for me."

It all just depends on what size feels right for you. I personally started at 7A (they were given to me in a 40 pack for free) and when I switched to 5A it was like running a sprint for the first time without ankle weights.   If you're worried about not having enough hitting power for rock, try a longer version of a 5A or B, or maybe a different type of wood (I prefer Pro Mark's Japanese Oak 5A sticks.) However, I caution you to not focus too much on how hard you're hitting the drums. The drummers for those 80's bands were also part of the image, so they had to be sure to put on a good show, which often meant hitting the everloving shit out their drums. In my experience, there comes a point where hitting a cymbal or drum harder is not going to improve the sound at all. I suggest focusing instead on fluidity, as I think that would help you much more as you practice. Here's a video of my favorite drummer, Blake Richardson, to illustrate what I'm talking about: https://youtu.be/JUI75SqcnSM"

drums,3cq5ww,josephsrollins,2,Fri Jul 10 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"I have a collection of Sabian B8 cymbals, including a medium crash ride that ive always loved. The bell sounds like shit, but riding it sounds pretty and the crash is deep and solid. As for sticks, you cant go wrong with Vic Firth 5As. Theyre cheap, reliable, and comfortable. Ive recently moved on to Pro-Mark Japanese Oak 5As. I think the Vic Firths would be better for rock, but if you ever want to get into jazz or genres with more fundamentals, I would definitely try the marks out. Also, a big china cymbal, although certainly not a necessary cymbal, can be fun as hell to smash on and add effect to crashes."
drums,3cq5ww,ANumenorean,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend staying light on the number of cymbals. Start out with a maximum of two. You don't want to get yourself into the habit of overplaying, because the majority of gigs you play won't have professional setups or sound engineers that can actually balance those audio levels well. Discipline is far more important than showing off, you don't need to buy too much if you're just starting out. Also, they're expensive as fuck.  You probably shouldn't go lighter than 5A sticks if you're playing rock music, but beyond that it's mostly down to preference. I'm a short guy that likes heavy music, so I tend to get on well with sticks that are quite long and quite bulky. Additionally, I tend to prefer sticks without finish because I find them to be too slippery. This makes my current sticks perfect for me. This is the kind of thing you can only discover for yourself by playing more and finding out what you like. Start simple and figure out the rest as you go."

drums,3cqabe,DarkNostril,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"Cables turning green are natural, but it might just be wear and tear. Send them back to UE to look into. The problem could be as simple as wax buildup or a worn cable."
drums,3cqabe,EYEJ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"Well, first is have you checked for any blockages? I have UE 7's and I noticed I was having one louder than the other but it was just because one had built up a considerable amount of junk and once I cleaned it out it went back to normal. Secondly, try switching the cabling; unplug the buds from the cable and swap them and see if it's resistance or problems in the cable. If the gain difference switched sides, you can get a new cable for cheap. If it doesn't switch sides and the tubes are cleared, I would send them in to UE for maintenance (where are you located? Their headquarters are in Irvine CA, so if you live in LA, OC, San Diego, or the inland empire you can just drive them over and have them take a look)   Lastly, if you've got 5000+ hours out of them, they may have completed their useful life and an upgrade may be a good choice. Did you pay for them yourself or did you have them purchased for you for work? If you have to pay yourself, then I probably wouldn't buy new ones, but if you work for a studio or a church or some other job where you use them for work, get them to pay.  Edit: I just thought of the scariest option.... See an audiologist and make sure its not your ears and it is truly a gain difference from the buds. I guess you'd probably be able to tell with other headphones, but it might not be as pronounced as it is with the custom fit and good seal."

Like /u/DarkNostril said... there are some options but until you buy a snare more suited to your taste... any heads you try will be a compromise.  Doesn't need to be expensive... a steel 14x5 kit snare will move more air and get closer to the sound you're after.
drums,3cqg6l,GOTaSMALL1,2,Fri Jul 10 02:21:55 2015 UTC,Thicker head would give you more body but you sacrifice the high end crispiness.   Best of both worlds is obviously a new drum but going with a 2ply head in general will pull more low end out of the drum.
drums,3cpy65,UpholdAnarchy,2,Thu Jul 9 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"Add EQ. Boost the lows 3 - 5 dB, boost the highs 1 - 3 dB. Look up different miking techniques. You can definitely record drums with one mic, and the sound you get right now is okay, but once you mess with EQ it will sound great.

At the end of the day you really just want to either get a solid set of single-driver monitors or pony up the cash for a set of dual-driver monitors.

That being said, the hardware is top notch and I owned a PDP LX kit which was the same shells with the older pacific oval lug and the bass is still one of the best I've ever heard. The rack toms were a bit ""thin"" sounding and could have been more full toned but the floor toms had great low end. If you love the specs and finish I'd say go for it."
drums,3cow27,Bireme713,2,Thu Jul 9 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"I own a PDP Platinum and used to own a PDP LX as well.  $750 is a bit high for an asking price.  I'd try to get down to $650 or so.  They sold new for $1100-1300 back in the late 2010's, and I picked my 4-piece up off craigslist for $500 about 2 years ago.  They are good quality sets and I like mine a lot.  If you're looking to spend $750, you could probably pick up a new PDP Concept Maple kit for around the $700-900 mark; depending on how many toms you want.  The Concept and Platinum are very comparable."

drums,3cogdj,BenMelanin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:09 2015 UTC,Thanks man! The verses are in 7/8. The chorus is a bit trickier. It's 3 bars of 7/8 and 1 bar of 12/8.. So I guess 1 bar of 33/8. It repeats that 2 times and goes back into the verse by cutting off the 12/8 bar. At the end I just repeated the 33/8 pattern with slight groove variations. It took a few attempts getting the drum beat to line up with the bass. I wrote the bass lines first and it's easier doing odd times on bass for me. Thanks for your question this is the first I really thought about how I count it😊
drums,3cogdj,BenMelanin,2,Thu Jul 9 16:48:36 2015 UTC,Why do you think it's easier doing odd time on bass? I'm curious. Is it because there's an obvious melody?  This music is high-level man. You should be signed to a label.

At first I was trying to incorporate far too many rudiments into my set playing at once. I then realized to pick one or two to work on until I had them competent enough to use in gig situations. Then add one or two more, rinse, wash, repeat."
drums,3cnf57,fnordpow,3,Thu Jul 9 13:19:48 2015 UTC,"I teach drumlines for a living. From a drumline perspective, the stickings and height interpretations are everything. I've always transferred over that thought process to playing drum set. While I do believe that things can be achieved in multiple ways, I also believe that applying certain stickings and methods to a musical selection will lead to a more musical interpretation."
drums,3cnf57,gingerpanduh,2,Thu Jul 9 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"On a pure musical level, does it sound ""right""?  Then its right.  As long as you're getting out what you wanted to say musically you're doing it right.  On a technical level, certain stickings make it easier to do certain accent patterns and rhythms split around the kit.  So there a sticking kind of does matter if you want it to sound ""right"".  On a showmanship level, certain stickings look a certain way and can lead to flashy things like stick tricks, crossovers, etc.  You can play the same rhythm a bunch of different ways with different stickings to look cool to an audience.  Like everything in life, your playing is your own personal balance of these things.  You pick what you want to focus on.  I think you've got the right idea with playing what you can.  No one skips straight to advanced level cheesed flamadiddle-diddles around the kit.  Its all building blocks.  One thing adds to the next and then adds to the next.  Eventually you can make musical skyscrapers.  Crawl then walk then run."
drums,3cnf57,mikecoldfusion,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Proper sticking is whatever properly executes the material.  If a piece is ""supposed"" to be played one way, but sounds better and more consistent if you play it ""wrong,"" then play it ""wrong."""
drums,3cnf57,that1guypdx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about sticking is that (this is going to be a tough one) when you have something like paradiddles - RLRRLRLL - where each R or L is an 8th note, people execute it where they do it including both hands, but they don't really look at what each hand is doing independently.  I see a lot of people, and I was guilty of it myself, where they use their right hand to lead the left in the sticking, where their right hand flows and has a great motion, never stops at the top or bottom of a stroke, and doesn't hesitate, while their left hand doesn't have that fluid motion.  So taking these paradiddles apart (each R,L, or - is an 8th note) by stick is you have R-RR-R-- and -L--L-LL.  The idea is to play both of those where each hand is comfortable doing what it has to by itself, so when you put it together you get the exact same quality of playing out of each hand, and it will sound much more even, and the motion will be also.   This is at least what I've seen where sticking really makes a difference.  If you don't practice sticking hand by hand as well as both hands together, you're going to have a left hand independence issue and a big difference in feel when it comes down to it."

drums,3co5me,M3lllvar,2,Thu Jul 9 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"I replace the stock heads on my drums almost immediately after purchase, which includes the kick's reso head. I just like the cleaner look and don't feel like everyone needs to know what brand drums I play.   And at the end of the day the majority of drum manufacturers make the stock resonant available for special order if you want another one or need a replacement for whatever reason."
drums,3co5me,DarkNostril,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"First off, you don't need to save your sonor head, but I'd recommend buying a new reso anyway just because stock heads typically aren't great. Not super important on a kick reso but it'll make a difference. Second, your kick drum doesn't have to be ported to be mic'd, unless you have to use a Beta 91 for some reason. When you cut that hole in your head, its going to take away from the resonance of your resonant head. Its like the difference between concert toms and regular toms, the concert toms are going to be super short and thuddy; same with a ported head to a degree. Just not as extreme. If you can use a Shure Beta 52 or an Audix D6, just put it a little further away, 6-12 inches, and gain up the mic a bit. Sound guys prefer ported heads but only because that's what their used to. At the end of the day, it affects the tone of your drum and if you like the sound of a non ported head, then keep it that way.   Now, all that being said, if you like the sound of it ported, by all means, Port it. I have mine ported so I'm not saying one is better than the other, but the decision is up to you, even though your sound guys will probably give you shit for it."

drums,3cmb5g,eggydrums115,5,Thu Jul 9 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"A 42 strand will offer more buzz and it will also dampen your resonant head. So if you have a snare that you want a fatter sound out of it will help. I like putting 42s on really deep snares that have trouble getting buzz or on shallow drums that I want to be all fat and gushy. Also if you play live and only use a top miked snare, they can project more ""snare"" sound in high volume situations, where a high tuned snare or a deep and low snare can sound like a tom. Hope that helps."

drums,3cn16j,Chubaw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry no one has answered your question. I have no education in music past majoring in percussion for four years at a performing arts high school. I went to college for a trade but I work still, when I can, as a musician. Some of the people I have worked with have BA in music performance and I've never been blown away by what they can do. Now I know this is not a blanket statement for all drummers with degrees but I can't be convinced I need to go to school for anything other than connections. What is appealing about grad school for music that you cannot accomplish without?  P.s. I am not meaning to sound condescending. I would honestly like to have the conversation with someone."
drums,3cn16j,Hawkinsmj6,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I've been waiting, haha! And you do not sound condescending at all. While making connections is something I would definitely benefit and look forward to (it's all about who you know in this biz, of course) I mostly want to study jazz with an educator who has made it his primary focus. I still play jazz in clubs around my town, play in a few bands (one country and one funk/hip hop) and I'm very well rounded as a player, I am just starting to see the hole in my playing and want to get better. Of course I know that I can do most of that on my own accord, but honestly it's a little difficult working full time and gigging every weekend to really sit down and even practice anymore. So really, it's to get out of my comfort zone and get really good instruction on how to approach what I want to better in my playing. Sorry if this is jumbled, I get ahead of myself."

Currently I'm swinging/subbing for an amusement park. I've moved a couple times for my wife's job and have had to make new contacts in a new city so I can understand that. Degrees cost so much money though. I couldn't imagine spending 30-60k for a performance/education degree then paying for grad school. That being said, spending the majority of my time practicing and learning my art would be amazing."

Luckily I know a few people in different music hubs in the states so hopefully some contacts will be available, haha. I'm extremely fortunate to say that I was on scholarship in college so I have zero debt. The only way I would really consider doing grad school is if a TA position would be offered. I'd still pay a substantial amount, but it would be significantly less than going in cold. But I think the positives outweigh the negatives in this situation, because I really just want to further my craft and pursue higher education."
drums,3cn16j,Hawkinsmj6,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:02:17 2015 UTC,I've looked into going back. Coming out of a performing arts school I had scholarship opportunities but opted for a trade and I cannot complain. But I'm not sure what my options are now and I couldn't imagine my wife and I trying to live without my income let alone if I were further in debt just to get to play drums. I think for now I gotta stay my course and hope something opens up and I can start to transition towards music full time. What grad schools have you looked into?

Throw the old snare head upside down on the new head or cut out the rim part and you have a heavy duty muffler. It also fits on a  14"" tom. Try some paradiddles on that with bass drum playing 4 on the floor if you're short on ideas ;)  You can also cut out a falam slam type of pad for the bass drum. iirc there wasn't such pads in the 90's and this is what was used to get some extras wetness and slap/snap sound out of the bassdrum.  I built a coctail bd out of a 16"" floor tom by cutting out a 14"" part from the heads center (batter side) and bought a thick batter head for the bottom side. You can reverse the bd beater with little fixing. The remnants of the cut head I threw inside to muffle the batter head. It needed some micing to cut through the band, but worked for a small venue."

drums,3cmozs,descole0,2,Thu Jul 9 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"I am going to make a guess at what you are saying: Assuming you are a right handed drummer and that you are playing the hats with your right hand and the kick with the right foot. When you play anything on the kick your hat is hitting as well. You need to break down to the core of the issue and it will be really simple to do.  Play a straight 1/4 beat on the hat on all 4 beats at a slow tempo. Then add in the kick on the same 1/4 beat on all 4 beats. Now, drop the kick out again and just play the hats. Next, bring the kick back in but this time playing on all the ""ANDS"".  I'd suggest starting to work on this around 70 - 80 BPM with the metronome. This will help get the 2 parts separated and build some independence. Once you get really good with it try bringing the snare back in on the 2 and 4 beats.   Hope that helps."

drums,3cmozs,toxicgarbage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"u/descole0 has given you the best answer.  Let me extend on it.  I don't know if there's a pdf floating around of it, but there's a book called the New Breed by Gary Chester.  It's pretty sweet, as in it gives you several beats to play, and then another line dedicated to ""melodies"" you play alongside those beats.  In one system, you have the melody part played by your right foot for example, then the next you play the melody with your left foot, etc. etc.  Really good for building independence all over the kit.  Also, two things I did was switch my kit around to be a left handed kit and play everything backwards.  The other thing was that no matter how I was playing (single bass, or double bass) is that I would always rely more on my left foot than my right, as every quarter note (or 8th, and sometimes 1/2 note) I would be closing the hi hat to keep time, as opposed to just playing on 1s and 3s primarily on the bass drum."
drums,3cmu92,jstan44,3,Thu Jul 9 03:19:46 2015 UTC,"Well what I did, (besides lessons) is think about how they are two different tempos that overlap each other landing on the same point every so often. A good way to start learning is slowing getting your hands used to different time feels like 4/3, with one hand playing 4 quarter notes and one playing 3 quarter note triplets, landing together on the downbeat of every measure. The whole thing about polyrhythms is they are really confusing, but with enough practice one day it'll snap in your mind and you will understand. One day, young padawon."

drums,3cmu92,MagicalFetus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:24:36 2015 UTC,"A good way is first of all seeing them as being normal rythms, just different that the standard ones. After that, counting in groups of 2 or 3 helps a ton, and placing accents on the important notes to keep you on track will take you a long way. then, you'll get the feeling for it and it'll be as comfortable as a standard 4/4 beat."
drums,3cmu92,stringsandwinds,2,Thu Jul 9 07:16:14 2015 UTC,"Basically ignore what I just said, i'm tired and was thinking of odd-numbered beats. I don't think this applies to polyrythms."

drums,3cmo3p,DarkNostril,3,Thu Jul 9 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"I mean I believe that he didn't use triggers or supplements, but the kit is definitely doctored from it's natural sound (compression, EQ, etc). So while u/GOTaSMALL1 may be stretching the truth, he's not entirely wrong that you could get almost any kit sound like that with the same attention to mixing and tuning.   It's also in a giant room, which will make any acoustic kit sound huge even before all the post-production is done."
drums,3cmo3p,GOTaSMALL1,2,Thu Jul 9 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"What he said. Doing that with Pearl Forums is my smartassed way of saying that among the myriad of factors involved in how he is getting that sound... The brand and model of the kit is the least important. Drummers, young ones especially, get WAY too hung up on which drums sound which way. With a good edge, round shells and functional tuning hardware... Any kit can sound good."
drums,3cmo3p,theothernameplate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:50 2015 UTC,His overheads probably arent picking up the ring of the shells over cymbals. Otherwise the overall sound is based primarily off of your ability to tune and the heads you choose.

drums,3cmo3p,GreenbrierMusic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:27:47 2015 UTC,"Between youtube compression, room dynamics, and ""mixing"", it's not perfect. But that's the kit sound for the most part. Looks like he's got g2's and g1 resos on it. Kit sounds great, just like it does in person if you take your time tuning it.  Kit and cymbal videos were our thing for a while until we realized that it's basically impossible to convey the authentic sound without self hosting the files, dropping a lot more money on audio gear and building out a dedicated studio."

drums,3cmo3p,TheUnclescar,0,Thu Jul 9 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"I have a PDP Concept Birch. I still have stock heads and don't have it tuned perfectly, but yes, it does sound very good on its own. Maple seems to be more popular though.  I've followed Cobus for quite some time on Youtube. Good find. :)  Comparing the versions with and without the drums, it seems he literally just muted the other instruments and copy/pasted the video and drum recording into a new post. I wouldn't say ""boring"" because he's giving us a drums only version of a song he collaborated on. Drums don't have to be exciting and intense to work with a song. Over playing can easily ruin a song, and his goal wasn't to show off in this video.  He has good heads, has his drums tuned well, and he says in the description that there was a good amount of mixing that went into it, so hearing these drums acoustically and live with no mics they will not sound the same, but the PDP concept series is a solid choice, speaking from personal exerience and good representation of quality via Mr Cobus."

So I have a 15 diameter X 17 depth floor Tom (also birch) that I converted without drilling it. I got a pearl opti-mount (which I have for all of my rack toms to begin with. I believe however that the drum has to be a certain lug count for some of the sizes to work as you purchase the mounts for depth not diameter.), and the pearl jungle kick mount, which fits into the opti-mount, raises the kick and gives you a place to attach a pedal. As far as heads go I still haven't gotten that figured out. Definitely thicker heads. I found that taping a second head upside down onto the batter side drops he pitch and makes it sound much more like a kick drum than a Tom. It's never really gonna sound like a kick but that's the closest I've gotten to it. Hope this helps!"

drums,3cl7l9,UpholdAnarchy,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"Without knowing exactly what you're having trouble with, I'll take a stab. After the high hat accents (ba BUM BUM) make sure you come back into the groove with a snare hit, not the kick drum. Just keep it simple, the songs all in 4/4. Hope that helps"

It's not going to line up directly on 1 2 3 4 etc, it's going to be in between the 1 and the e if that makes sense.    EDIT: It also has 2 different time signatures. It's in 4/4 and 6/8."

drums,3cl7l9,Archerisjustok,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"Haha I love this kind of stuff. My mind instantly thinks it's going to be a proggy 9/8 kind of thing, but it's really just in 5/4 at the beginning.  It's tricky because it's not tricky!"
drums,3cl7l9,SnareSpectre,6,Thu Jul 9 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"actually, I believe it's 4 the whole way through. It's easy to tell if you listen to the snare backbeat, it doesn't really move around at all."
drums,3cl7l9,IrSpartacus,0,Thu Jul 9 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"Well I mean...it can be in anything anyone wants it to be, right? I consider the first measure to be in 5/4, with the 1 of the next measure starting on the word ""feels."" So it would go:  5/4, 4/4, 4/4, 3/4, 4/4, 4/4 before repeating. On paper it certainly more complicated than calling it straight 4 (which I agree also works out), but to me, that mimics the phrasing of the lyrics in the simplest way.  Just because the snare beat doesn't move around just implies it's in #/4, but imo the ""numerator"" is up for interpretation (which makes this song kind of cool!).  :)"
drums,3ck3g4,DrumJr,8,Wed Jul 8 15:07:56 2015 UTC,"I have one and it does the job alright  Honestly, if you're looking for a new single pedal, I'd tell you to look at the iron cobra (which also comes with a nice hardcase) or the DW 5000, both great pedals that aren't ridiculously expensive. They both play great, feel very solid, and my iron cobra has been on almost every gig with me for 3 years and it still looks brand new.   Good luck!"
drums,3ck3g4,jamayTRPbro,3,Wed Jul 8 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I found it amazing when I tried it. It's like.. a ""no bullshit"" kind of pedal, which I like. When i pass judgement over a pedal, I always worry about doubles. Anything else I can live with, but if doubles are weird to play, then the pedal is dysfunctional to me. I've come to the conclusion that a lightweight pedal is best, for my technique. So the Jojo is great. It comes with a bag, and is easy to mount, so for a gigging drummer, switching a pedal between two acts is pretty nice being able to do quickly."

If you go through bass heads on the reg, this babe ain't for you.   If you want a consistent pedal that works well out of the box (bag hah), sets up fast, and that has that light ""vintage"" feel, this is your next purchase. I love the fact that it fits my dorky ass clown feet in it also.   Just fyi, I play rock n' roll, funky shit, some hip hop, and also have great jazz ""hack"" chops.   My suggestion? Buy it from somewhere with a lengthy return policy, use it for a couple practices and a show, and then return it. Buy a Speed Cobra and do the same. Then decide which one works best for you."

drums,3ck3g4,GreenbrierMusic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"I've tried the pedal in music stores but did not play around with adjustments. It felt pretty smooth, and had a strange ""give"" to it from what I remember.  As you think about what pedal to get, my 2c is that you'll get used to pretty much any pedal you buy after adjusting it and playing on it for a month. I'd pay close attention to (1) how long a pedal has been on the market and (2) what reviews have to say about how it holds up over time. (2) will be especially important if you're going to be gigging and transporting the pedal. Different drummers are used to different feels for a pedal, so it'll really help you the most to try this pedal and others if you can."

drums,3cl5cl,asenchi,2,Thu Jul 9 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"They take warming up to. It took me awhile but they became one of my favorite groups. My first time listening to Choose Your Weapon and Tawk Tomahawk were non stop through the albums. They both just go top to bottom so well. If you have the time and willingness to give them a shot, try listening to one of their albums beginning to end. Tawk Tomahawk is WAY shorter so maybe you can start with that. Personally, I think Choose Your Weapon is a little on the weird side, but I still love it. Tawk is a little more ""straight up"" for lack of a better word. Lace Skull and Shaolin Monk Motherfunk are my two favorite songs. They just feel right. As for the drumming, I don't know if I would call Perrin's playing new or groundbreaking by any means, but the dude kills it in that setting. He nails the feel changes of every song and works the pocket perfectly. BUT in the end Hiatus isn't for everyone. As much as I would love to have every person in the world appreciate Hiatus and Snarky Puppy as much as I do, people just groove to different shit. If it isn't your thing, there's nothing wrong with that!"
drums,3cl5cl,DontClapOn1and3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:16:58 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to explain. I think that overall the drumming is more musical than anything I've heard since Brian Blade. He is able to craft drum parts in ways I've never heard before, and he relies much more on rhythmic theory than on chops/technique. He also does some grooves that are totally new to me. It's this thing where the kick or snare are a little bit early and it creates this weird rubbery feel. It almost sounds wrong, but it's not."

They still have the same basic tonal pallate though, so you'd probably be alright mixing them. Those AAs that you have are certainly on the louder end of the spectrum anyway, so I'm sure you'll be fine. If it was an AA thin crash or something it might be a different story."

drums,3cl3bu,dmccauley,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:02 2015 UTC,Totally hinges on the sound you are going for/genre. I really love the punchy studio sounds of the 70's and like the Evans Hydraulic Clear Heads on my Toms (seems to be an unpopular choice for most folks). But the Evans EMAD kick batter seems to work for just about anything in the studio because it offers so much built in dampening control.

drums,3cl3bu,shittyfunmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:57:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want.   Find out what your favorite drummer did gear-wise (and mic-setup wise), and then shoot your engineer a few songs that feature what you consider a great ""drum sound"".   As a drummer, your sound is reaaally going to determine how the overall recording vibes."
drums,3clv6z,VanLeeuwen,2,Wed Jul 8 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"The loudest parts are the kick and the cymbals, in my experience - the 'thwack' noise travels a lot more than mesh hits. If you have an extra $1000 to spare, you could consider getting Zildjian Gen16s - otherwise, just make sure you have the windows and door closed to minimize sound transferal.  Also, don't brace the kit against a wall since that would cause avoid sympathetic vibrations. You could consider getting lighter beaters, too, to help with the kick noise.  That ought to be good enough - also check your lease and see if there's 'quiet hours' or anything like that and make sure you don't violate that."

It's not only my favorite cymbal, it's one of my favorite instruments I've ever played, period. Price was right, too. I'm thoroughly convinced, ever since playing a 21"" A Sweet Ride, that my cymbal is the model for that one. When it came out, the ads called it a reproduction of ""an old favorite from the early 70s from Avedis Zildjian's personal collection."" It sounds a lot like mine.  It came to me with a vicious keyhole in it, but I've always used nylon sleeves with it, and it's never changed size. Makes me so angry at whoever made it that way. It wasn't my friend who did that, although he used to play - the cymbal was in a trap case that a friend was going to store at his place ""for a few weeks,"" eight years before that, that he suddenly decided one day he wanted gone.   Also in the box, along with some random rusty hardware, was the best sounding cowbell I've ever heard, which has also been on my kit ever since, and six other cymbals which were mostly broken or crap, except for the amazing, very old Paiste 502 ride that instantly turned whomever played it into Philly Joe Jones.

When I picked it up the drum guy told me they started printing the dates on the inside in the early 2000s (my kit has the dates printed in them from 2002). So chances are it's a late 90s model. The hoops have seen better days and the brass finish is wearing off on the lugs as well, but that makes me happy that someone used it. A lot. The only thing I might do is buy a new mag throw-off and a 3 position butt plate in gold (not overly expensive, about $80 total.)  Edit: Oh yeah, it also weighs a metric fuck-ton. Probably 20 lbs."

In my experience though vintage Zildjians have more character than the ones manufactured today and usually can be had on the cheap."

I'm a huge fan of the Dark Energy line too and the high-end Paistes can often be found at about half the price of a new one. You're not going to find anything that sounds even remotely similar to a Dark Energy Crash from anyone but Paiste - you'll find dark or shimmery, but nobody makes both like Paiste.  Meinls are dark, but low-pitched and gongy; Zildjians are boring but for the grace of God (I've heard a few new As that sound fantastic, but that's only two or three), and good Sabians can be just as hard to find. I love Sabian's HH line, but nobody seems to carry them and I'm not going to buy anything that isn't a Paiste without playing it first."

They're also molded to my ear canals, so the isolation is nearly perfect. Double low drivers, one mid, and one high driver. Takes care of the lower frequencies being pushed by toms and kick.   In-ears will definitely save your hearing in the long run, just remember that since you're isolating outside noise, you don't have to turn your mix up super loud.

I do it in this order:  Adjust your throne until you are sitting comfortably and your feet are hitting the pedals right, whatever that means to you.   Place your throne so that your kick pedal, foot, thigh, and hip are all on the same plumb line, going right through the center of your bass drum.  Place your snare stand wherever it puts the drum in the ideal place for you to hit it, as long as you maintain that plumb line through the bass drum.  Place your hihat the same way, a second plumb line at whatever angle works best for your legs/crotch.  Once you've done this, if any other part of your setup disturbs this arrangement, either relocate it or discard it. Whatever it is, it's not more important than this.  Dat's wut I tink, anyways."

I think the big obvious thing you guys/girls/whatevers need to work on is timing.  The guitarist sounds like he's not even listening to you at certain points (the intro especially), and you definitely get yourself off-tempo during some of those fast fills.  Start practicing with a click (everybody, not just the drums) if you don't already.  Practicing at slower tempos and ramping it up over time would be a good way to clean up your timing on the fills."
drums,3cf9og,champaignthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what we were working on today was the timing and fixing up some points. There is no bass yet, just two guitars and drums. Thanks for the input."
drums,3cf9og,TheUnclescar,2,Tue Jul 7 23:38:11 2015 UTC,"the mixing is okay enough, i can hear all the drums just fine, but I highly recommend doing a retake with a metronome. That will solve MOST of the issues I can tell, including the (many) times it sounds like you guys are not in sync with eachother, if you can play steady the song will immediately sound many times better.  Personally when I record instruments I record each instrument seperately (especially when i record myself because i can only play one at a time! haha) and playing each instrument to [the same] click track makes it very easy to find where inaccuracies are across the board, and fix them individually.  Second to that would be consistency in volume. Some hits are harder and more clear others are softer/inaccurate and muddy. if you can bring the outliers closer to the average so that each drum and cymbal sound relatively the same throughout the song that will also help with sound quality. Compression is usually the most common method, but it cannot repair everything."

drums,3cfx4f,that1guypdx,0,Tue Jul 7 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"Drum covers are usually intended to be sort of a showcase thing.  That's why the drums are always way out on top of the mix and over-compressed to squash everything else out, and why the playing tends to be very flashy and overdone compared to the original drum part.  In terms of drum covers, I feel like it's a bit pointless unless you change it up somehow and do something new with it.  I don't see the point in watching some random drummer just play someone else's song exactly like the record from front to back.  If I wanted to see the original song played the way it was written, I'd just watch the original drummer play the damned thing.  I'm not saying you need to go full-douche mode with it and start doing acrobatics with your sticks or throwing in goofball hand-foot sextuplets and shit all over the place, I'm just saying if you're gonna do covers make them your own.

drums,3celpu,DudeWhereIsMy_Car,2,Tue Jul 7 08:41:03 2015 UTC,Last week they gave this guy in DIY so much shit for building a stage for his kit. I learned a lot because of that post lol. Do not build a insulated stage it's pretty much useless because the vibration will still go to the floor. Instead they recommended the tennis ball drum kit riser. I'm mobile right now but I will be back with many links.  Edit: Links arrived.
drums,3celpu,enjoyit7,2,Tue Jul 7 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been in a handful of different small/DIY venues before and after they built their stages and it makes a huge difference.  Getting stuff up off the floor really cleans up the sound, as long as you keep your points of contact with the floor minimal."
drums,3celpu,champaignthrowaway,2,Tue Jul 7 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"blankets, foam, carpet, padded surfaces... all these things you can find for cheap at thrift stores (or in your house already). Use tape or rope or pins to put stuff up. As much padded, non-reflective surfaces as you can surround the kit with (walls, ceiling, floor) will reduce the amount of noise inside the room. Keep in mind, this won't help a lot with what it sounds like outside the room."
drums,3celpu,arguearguingargue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:24:35 2015 UTC,"You don't want to sacrifice the sound of the drums so don't dampen or  throw anything over the drums themselves. Make them sound amazing.  Now first thing you want to do is decouple them from the floor. A small riser would be best. 2x4s and foam and blankets works. Build a frame and insulate it, meaning fill it with as much dense material as possible. That means thrift super hard. Someone else mentioned tennis ball riser. You must make sure there is something between the 2x4s and the floor otherwise you're doing nothing. U-boats aren't expensive for decoupling but you could also use hockey pucks, tennis balls, thick foam or neoprene.   After you build that, put as much dense material on the walls as possible. I've made panels before by making a frame with 2x4s and wrapping that with carpet, then filling them with something (foam, dense material, etc). Literally every inch of every wall if you can. That will make a huge difference, ceiling included.  EDIT: This is a very helpful place to learn more about acoustics.  http://johnlsayers.com/Recmanual/Titles/Acoustics1.htm  Also here is a list of DIY panels and how to make them.

drums,3celpu,devonitely,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"Sound proofing is virtually impossible to do to an existing room without professional help and several thousand dollars.  What you are trying to do is sound treatment.  Is this a big, wide-open, unfinished basement?  If the room itself is too big you can section off a smaller portion by hanging blankets or carpet scraps from the floor joists overhead.  Little things like throwing some cheap carpet on the floor and putting a couple of couches and chairs in the room can be surprisingly effective in medium sized rooms.  There is a reason you see a lot of studios with plenty of big, cushy furniture hanging around - serves double duty.  :D  In my honest opinion though, gobos are probably your best bet since you can throw them up and adjust them very easily.  Here are some professional quality ones, but don't feel like you have to spend a fortune.  A few heavy moving blankets draped over a couple of 90 degree angled boom stands gets the job done just about as well (at the expense of looking ugly as hell, but who cares).  If you want something a little more permanent, simply build a frame out of 2x4s, stuff it with heavy insulation, and then wrap it in durable fabric.  For a really dry sound, tuck them close in by your set like you're walling it off.  For more air/space, back them off a few feet and leave a gap, or play around with placing them in the corners of the room to clean up some of the sloppy low frequencies.  Gobos can be as simple or as complicated as you want.  An excellent exercise in learning how sound treatment affects a room would be to build a pair of large, 5'x7'ish gobos on the cheap and experiment with placing them around the kit and the room in different configurations.  tl;dr - sound proofing is probably not possible, but you can calm the room down in a couple of different ways.  I'd personally recommend gobos, because they are extremely effective and can be used to adjust the sound of the room on the fly very quickly."

Sometimes drums and cymbals sound a little odd all by themselves, but blend really well in the mix when you're actually putting them to practical use.  I guess my point is this - unless you just play drums as a strictly solo instrument with no other accompaniment, don't stress over what your gear sounds like in a vacuum because what it sounds like on it's own is not the important bit.  The way it blends with the rest of your kit, and with the rest of the band is the important bit."

drums,3cdsin,Severosk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is present on almost every cymbal. Some of my crashes also produce the sound from the bow."
drums,3cdsin,Lambskin1,2,Tue Jul 7 05:03:22 2015 UTC,"I think what you're hearing is basically the gong sound. As a cymbal gets larger in diameter, it will have more and more of that gongy clang sound that you would expect from a big ol' symphonic gong.  I notice all of your cymbals are Mienl - it's possible that the sound is more pronounced in their cymbals than other brands. I have no data to back that up, just a thought.  Honestly, something that might be contributing to the sound being so noticeable is the way you position your cymbal. If a cymbal (or drum, or any vibrating surface) is parallel or close to parallel with a non-vibrating surface (i.e. the floor), it will create standing waves at specific frequencies. Play around with different angles and see if that helps at all.  Ninja-edit: I just realized that I have no idea if you made these videos or just found them to illustrate your point. If you didn't, then some of my comments are less relevant, but perhaps still worth thinking about. Anyway, good luck and I hope you find the sound you're looking for :)"

Drumming was excelent though :)"

drums,3ced9w,Zagaro,2,Tue Jul 7 06:44:53 2015 UTC,"Impossible to do effectively and cheaply.  Set up in the basement away from windows if you can as the ground will block way more sound than walls.  If you want to build a room look at sound control insulation and mounting drywall on resilient channels.  The general rule for sound proofing is more mass = less sound escaping.  Need heavy things to stop the sound waves.  Contrary to popular opinion foam blocks on the walls does nothing to block sound.  It only controls sound reflections in the room.  And really, during the day I wouldn't be worried.  I'd be worried at night.  Unless you've got them set up in front of an open window and you're blasting for 4 straight hours there really isn't much legally they can do to you during the day."
drums,3ced9w,mikecoldfusion,2,Tue Jul 7 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"This right here.  Definitely do your best to be a good neighbor and all of that, but at the same time don't let having neighbors stop you from doing what you want to do on your own property.     Talk to them - plenty don't give a shit if you're noisy during the day time.  Lots of people are at work or out running errands anyway. Do what you can to keep the volume down - play in your basement if you have one, otherwise just try to set up away from windows and exterior walls if you can. Know your local regulations - sometimes you just get a dickhead neighbor who wants to freak out about any kind of noise whatsoever no matter how much you try to compromise, and in those situations you need to know exactly what your city allows you to do.  For example, in my town you can have up to a certain dB level audible from the sidewalk outside of your house between 9am and 9pm.  You can use a decibel meter to check this (there are some phone apps as well, you'll want to check into how accurate they are though).  People can call in noise complaints all they want, but if you're not breaking the law you're not breaking the law - eventually the cops get fed up with it and quit showing up."

drums,3cbckx,TheMumbles512,5,Mon Jul 6 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, my local Guitar Center had all of them right when they came out, so I got to tap around on them a bit. They are all pretty dry, not a lot of wash, even from the 24"" ones, and pretty dark. Not really my cup of tea, but they are cool. I think they would be pretty well suited to jazz and some funk, but I don't think they'll cut through the mix enough for most rock stuff. You'd really have to try to find some in a store to try out, because they are so different from each other, it would be impossible to get a sense of what they sound like based on a description alone."
drums,3cbckx,Hexenes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"Other than the AA Apollo they are all mellow, controlled, and fairly quiet. The Apollo is bright compared to the other B&Us but still warmer than other AAs.   I like the HH King and AA Apollo the best, and either one would be great for jazz and funk (but as others have said probably out of place in a rock setting). And nobody can argue how much bang for buck you get with the XS20 Monarch.   Overall though I'd still look elsewhere for a ride. None of them sound particularly compelling, especially in the case of the HH and HHX models since you can get much better cymbals than the B&Us for $400 (like Sabian's own HHX Legacy rides, Meinl's Byzance series or an Istanbul Agop)."

But, the Monarch is a great ride though!  Try it out as a crash, it does have a nice bell and body!"
drums,3cbckx,SpaceFlightNavigator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"They're jazz cymbals, more or less. My Sam Ash got the whole line shortly after they came out and my favorite was easily the 24"" HH King Ride; it's moderately dry and relatively thin, but it's unlathed on the top and it's huge so it's really easy to control and it has a surprisingly nice bell. The wash was incredibly smooth, while still being dark and complex. The 24"" King also felt really good.  I'm not sure where /u/Hexenes is coming from, saying they don't have a lot of wash... the only ones that were especially dry was the HHX Phoenix, which was really dry, and the HH Nova, which is thinner and didn't do a whole lot for me. The rest of them have a very nice balance of wash and definition.  They all sound completely different from anything Meinl make (Meinl tend to seem really low-pitched and sound a bit harsh in my opinion) so just be aware of that."
drums,3cbckx,themasecar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"Well. I play primarily Paiste Signature Full crashes and and older Sabian HH ride, and those have sustain for days, so comparatively speaking, the Big &Ugly line is pretty dead sounding to my ears. Like I said, the ones I played around with were super dry and didn't seem real washy to me. Different strokes for different folks and all that. Just the nature of this particular line would tell me that every single cymbal is going to sound different from the next.   Edit: specificity"
drums,3cbf0n,SavageSvage,8,Mon Jul 6 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"Practice. Practice playing everything slowly until you get it perfect, then up the tempo a bit. Rinse and repeat until you're at your target tempo.   Don't go faster or full tempo until it's absolutely perfect at the slower tempos. This is how you build muscle memory.

It's just KSKSKSKS, with hi hat in there somewhere, right?   Start with something simple, like 2 snare hits on the 4.  I had problems with this beat when I started.  It takes muscle memory to chunk down the individual hits into a group of 2 or 4 (depending on tempo), then you can feel the downbeat enough to land on it after a fill."

I notice that their drums are easy to fine tune because the action of turning each rod is very smooth. So smooth it almost feels loose.  The ""Pro"" of this is that the swivel nuts are less likely, if ever, to rust out and eventually break.  That said, I'm not saying ""deal with it."" I suggest rather than looking to replace an entire lug casing just buy new swivel nuts.  They are extremely easy to swap out and an entire set would cost little compared to a complete lug and rod swap.  Be aware, if you decide to use DW swivel nuts you will also have to buy DW tension rods. The thread pitch is completely different and proprietary. That would make for a pretty sweet upgrade though."
drums,3can3x,iamabootdisk,3,Mon Jul 6 13:47:47 2015 UTC,That's pretty solid advice; I appreciate it.  I hadn't considered swapping out that part alone but it makes perfect sense.  Thanks!

Dehydration can and will sneak up on you and you'll feel crappy and won't perform well.  Traveling combined with the stress of playing multiple shows make it hard to remember to stay hydrated.

If you're sharing kits, make sure you know what stuff you need to bring - sometimes it's just snare and cymbals; sometimes it's stands and stool too, so it's always worth checking. If you're using your own kit, first (obviously) check and double check that you've got everything - you don't want to get there and realise you've got everything except your snare stand. Second, don't assume the venues will have carpet: take a mat in case you're setting up on some highly polished ice rink of a wooden floor.  Make a list of all your gear so when you're loading out after a gig you know when you've got everything. You'll probably have that list in your head anyway, but having an actual list to refer to can really help to make sure you don't miss anything.

Also, number these items both on the list and on their case. Label what belongs in each case. I worked at a popular music venue for awhile and helped numerous bands load in and out. Sparta, the band formed from the half of At The Drive In that wasn't The Mars Volta, did this number/label/load order logic very well for a small touring band. It helped the people like myself, venue staff, help out efficiently, since we just needed to make sure we brought the next numbered item, and that whatever the label said was supposed to be in the case was there inside of it. Being organized is helpful for everyone!   Also, bring stuff to make sandwiches. Don't eat garbage the whole time or you'll be a jerk to everyone around you.

drums,3c84de,sleepydon,3,Mon Jul 6 01:04:11 2015 UTC,What's the purpose of a sub kick?
drums,3c84de,volcom0316,10,Sun Jul 5 21:58:04 2015 UTC,Basically a large microphone. So it picks up low-frequencies better than a regular mic because of its size. Together with a regular kick mic you get a really nice low-end oomph blended with the higher-end attack for a kick-ass bass drum sound.   They have become more and more popular over the past decade or so.
drums,3c84de,PhascinatingPhysics,6,Sun Jul 5 22:07:04 2015 UTC,I assume the speaker is actually the microphone then? Like how you can put headphones into the microphone jack and use it as a mic?  I thought at first this was an addon to the kick that would do an 808 sub bass sound when you triggered it maybe alongside a kick hit. Which would be pretty sweet.
drums,3c84de,CoffeeScentedUrine,9,Mon Jul 6 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   A microphone is really just a piece of something that flaps back and forth because of vibrating air that's caused by something jiggling back and forth. The ""diaphragm"" (as its called) is then coupled with an electromagnet, so as it vibrates, it creates and electric current. Using some fancy physics and engineering, people figured out how to make sound into electricity and back in to sound again, by doing the reverse with a speaker. But there, the electric current/electromagnet pushes the diaphragm itself, which then creates a copy of the original sound picked up by the microphone.   A sub kick is essentially all this, but using the speaker as a microphone. The trade of is that because the microphones diaphragm is so big, it takes a lot of sound to make it move, and it really only responds well to low frequencies."

drums,3c9dwk,Blueburnsred,8,Mon Jul 6 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"If you're going with Keller then get one of the thicker shells (8- or 10-ply). The reason behind this is twofold: first because you're going to want a lot of head contact in the bearing edge, and second you want the shell to promote volume and projection since the rounded edges won't be giving you the brightness you're likely used to.  As far as the edges, you'll want them to be round. At the very least a rounded 45-degree edge, but I'd recommend going with either a round-over or a baseball bat edge for maximum fatness if that's your goal with this build.  Pretty much all of the other specs are up to you. Tone comes primarily from those bearing edges. With Keller you're pretty much locked into a maple shell in the thickness you'll want, anyway, so I'd stick with that for the shell. 6-7"" depth will be a safe ballpark, 8"" if you're feeling adventurous.  You can stain maple almost any color you could want since it's a fairly white wood to begin with (yet another reason to use it for your first build). Any hardware store will have good stains and clear coats for wood.  Mapa burl is an example of a veneer wood (a species of poplar, in this case). Veneers are an outer ply added to the shell the same way the rest of the plies are; it is not a finishing process and you'll want to work with a professional drum building to accomplish something like this."

drums,3c8s7f,DarkNostril,6,Mon Jul 6 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest culprits for this is not playing with a vertical stroke, and instead ""slashing"" at the drumhead and literally scraping the coating off. So that'd be the first thing I'd take a look at.   Chipped stick tips also contribute to scraping the coating off regardless of technique."
drums,3c8s7f,luksuskristus,2,Mon Jul 6 01:30:09 2015 UTC,Well neither of those is my problem. Maybe I just expect more of the coating than I should haha
drums,3c8s7f,luksuskristus,2,Mon Jul 6 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"Well my follow up question is why does it matter to you? It doesn't effect the sound enough to notice it during playing, and if it's an aesthetic issue just switch to something that isn't coated but is still white, like a white suede or smooth white head."
drums,3c8s7f,Velocicrappper,2,Mon Jul 6 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"Haha it doesn't really matter all that much. I'm just particular about how my drums look. Secondary to sound, of course, but still."
drums,3c8s7f,Seafroggys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Personally i think Emperors are the worst. I feel Ambassadors last longer, as far as coating-wise. I tried an Evans head on my Yamaha Recording snare, and the coating is still going strong for 4 months. I'd imagine, that if I played with brushes, Remo wouldn't really be the choice.."
drums,3c8s7f,TJdrums10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"Ya my G2s' coating is still good too! Dirty, but definitely not worn off. Weird.  I've had good luck with the Emperor X, but the Black X has been my favorite for a while now. Great durability and good sound. It costs pretty much the same but lasts longer than any other head I've had. It's the best choice for a poor gigging metal drummer. AND it's not coated, so nothing to wear off!"
drums,3c8s7f,champaignthrowaway,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:38:02 2015 UTC,Never tried neither. You used the Black X on a snare?
drums,3c8s7f,champaignthrowaway,2,Wed Jul 8 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"Yup! Two 10 mil plies plus a 5 mil reverse dot...and surprisingly responsive for such a heavy head. It's actually quite economical, too. I have yet to see even slight dimpling on one."
drums,3c8s7f,steveondrums,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"I use Remo coated Emperors on my snare drums.  I also play with brushes a fair amount.  The coating does smooth out and lose a lot of the roughness faster than I'd like, but it doesn't start actually chipping off for a pretty long time in my experience."
drums,3c8s7f,Severosk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"I have always heard on the intertubz that Remo has had shitty coating, yet I've exclusively played Remo and have never had that issue."
drums,3c8s7f,d_ja,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:02:05 2015 UTC,"I've played mostly Remo for a few years now and just ran into this issue when I re-headed my kit with coated Emperors. I expected the coating would come off eventually but it only took a few days before It was noticeable. I don't have a huge problem with it because they still sound fine, I was just surprised because I used to have coated Evans G2s and after over a year of using them on my toms barely any of the coating was completely removed"
drums,3c8s7f,steveondrums,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ya the G2 coating is very durable. Aesthetics aside, at least Remo heads don't start to sound bad after the coating wears off."
drums,3c8s7f,UpholdAnarchy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"Use Remo CS Coated on my snare and have never had trouble with the coating.  I felt like the coating wasn't as tough on the Emperors and Ambassadors I tried, but I haven't been through many of them recently so I could be wrong.  Certainly neither of them wore off after a couple hours of use though.  I've got around 20 hours on my current CS and it's still coated.  A bit dirty, but coated.  If these are the sticks you're using, keep in mind as well that those things are freaking clubs.  No judgement, just saying those are some big-ass sticks.  They're also factory seconds, so if you're not checking them for straightness and matching weights, that could be fucking with your technique a bit.  You'll tend to slash if the stick has any curve, and even matched pairs of labeled sticks will sometimes vary by 6-7 grams sometimes from what I've seen."
drums,3c8s7f,Drankolz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:54:24 2015 UTC,Yup those are the sticks! And I see they're on sale again...  But ya they're big. Sticks of that size just fit my hands really well. I have noticed some slight curving too. I just like how cheap they are.
drums,3c8s7f,UpholdAnarchy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah that'll be it then.  I suppose try some Evans and Aquarian heads, Aquarian in particular tends to be pretty tough."

Suspend  the triangle through the fishing wire and clip it to a cymbal arm/ music stands.   Protip* use two triangle clips to make it more stable and have your playing surface flat.

It might not be complicated to you now, but until you can visualise the logistics to cope with this it can totally seem problematic.  OP, you need to hang the triangle OFF of something, making sure there's no clamp or material physically next to it that it can bang into when swinging. Plenty of home made fixes to it when you start getting your head round the logistics, but there are some commercial helps too that work well, for example:  http://www.drumshop.co.uk/products/gibraltar-sc-dtc-deluxe-triangle-holder-clamp  Or one that I use personally (in conjunction with a teeny, basic clamp):  http://www.gear4music.com/Drums-and-Percussion/Meinl-Triangle-Holder-MCTRI/HA3"

My old school contacted me recently, asking if I would like them, because they had no use for them any more and they knew I was a music teacher. They have been written off and given to me to use as I see fit. They're in need of a clean and some parts, but otherwise usable.   I'm a music teacher at a regional school with little in the way of resources, and this is a fantastic opportunity to start a beginner drum line."

drums,3c5xzz,burp_derp,6,Sun Jul 5 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like drums are a very primal instrument, and any kit that is played can be enjoyable. With the right heads, any kit can sound decent. Cymbals are a different story of course, nothing can really cover a shitty cymbal sound. But there are people who prefer Sabian B8 over higher quality lines for some of their setup. All about preference.   That being said, a nice quality kit and cymbals are waaay more fun to play on. It will be much easier to get your setup right where you want it, and that will inspire some new grooves or fills, kind of re-kindles the love of the instrument in a way.  In general, if you have the capital available, upgrading is the way to go. Find that kit that you create a personal connection with and love it. But it's also okay to jam on lower quality gear. May I ask what setup you were thinking about? Just curious. Good luck in the hunt!"

drums,3c5xzz,R_locus,2,Sun Jul 5 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"It's always fun to get a new kit. I personally get excited to play on new drums.  However, you mentioned you are using ""old heads"" which suggests that changing your heads might make your drums sound better. I don't know exactly how old your heads are but it might be worth a try to swap them out with some new ones (batter and resonant sides). Changing heads and method of tuning can drastically change the sound of any set of drums. Look up what kind of heads some of your favorite drummers are using and try those out if you're not already using them.  Another thing you could try is learning a new style of music. If you've been playing double bass metal for 10 years, try playing something totally different like jazz or latin.   Do you play with other people, friends, bands, etc? That can make a difference as well."
drums,3c5xzz,R_locus,2,Sun Jul 5 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"have a band! I changed heads last year but there was no difference to me. My styles are fusion , jazz, prof, metal etc. Very diverse. I think I need a new kit is all!"
drums,3c5xzz,nilsph,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"A new kit might be the solution then. Something else you might want to try with a new kit is a different size or configuration. I started out playing a ""rock"" configuration with a 22"" kick and two rack toms and one floor tom as my first set for a few years. When I had some money and got into jazz, etc. I made the switch to a Gretsch Catalina Club. It's not a top of the line kit but the different sized drums and different configuration with one rack and one floor tom made me think a little differently about my playing. After I made the switch to one rack tom, I've never even considered getting another set with multiple rack toms. I like the placement of the ride cymbal over the bass drum. I also found that I like smaller kits with less cymbals/toms.  I would try out some different brands. I'm personally not a fan of Pearl drums but I know they sound just as good as any other brand.   One last suggestion would be getting a new book with solos, grooves, etc. Rick Latham's ""Advanced Funk Studies"" is a good one or Stanton Moore's ""Take it to the Street"" is good as well. A book by one of my former teachers, Dom Moio, called ""The Jury's Out"" has some good drum set solos to learn."

I always change my drums up and keep thinking.  I gues I'm getting a imperialstar from TAMA. I love tama. And DW, however those are FAR to expensive.  Will start looking at new grooves. Thank you for taking the time to comment!"
drums,3c5xzz,that1guypdx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, good equipment makes drumming more enjoyable.  But I regularly play on an Export that's similarly old and simply putting new brand heads on (2 years-ish ago, Remo Emperor/Ambassador/PS3) and tuning it worked wonders -- most drums that aren't high-end (and that would include pretty much everything within your budget) come with very cheap heads that won't last too long.  So if your set is in otherwise good condition, I'd rather buy new heads for batter and resonant sides and see if that doesn't do the trick as far as your drums are concerned -- if not, you can still use them to replace shitty stock heads. If it works out, you'll have plenty of money left for new cymbals and maybe a better snare, and/or hardware -- I bring e.g. my own bass drum and hihat pedals because those at the set suck big time."
drums,3c5xzz,Phyrexian_Possum,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:00:36 2015 UTC,New heads can go a long way. I put Remo Fiberskyns on my PDP X7 and they sound amazing. New heads can definitely bring fresh life to your kit and they are not horribly expensive. And sometimes you just get burned out. Take a week off and see how you feel then.
drums,3c5xzz,abacacus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can, but if   I'm only using old heads, and broken cymbals   ...that makes it worse.  But still, buying new drums for these reasons is like trading cars because you have a flat tire.   Try spending $100 on new heads, and give your drums a thorough reskinning and tuning. Replace your bullshit cymbals, because cheap drums with good heads and tuning can sound great, but crap cymbals are crap cymbals. Maybe invest in some new hardware, and reconfigure your setup.  If you're hell-bent on new drums and simply tired of the old ones, replace them. On the other hand, if it's merely the sound and your overall playing vibe you're tired of, there are many less expensive things you can do first.  Oh, and protip: If you sink the $$$ into new drums and let them sink into the same sorry state of disrepair as these are in, you'll eventually hate them, too."

drums,3c5xzz,that1guypdx,-1,Sun Jul 5 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on your goals as a player I think. Your hands will not likely recognize the difference between the kind or quality of shells that your playing on. Same concept with cymbals, a stick hitting metal is pretty much always going to feel the same whether it's a first act cymbal or a paiste. You could argue however, that the heads would feel different based on the material they are made of and how worn they are  Tldr: for practice sake, no not really."
drums,3c5xzz,theothernameplate,2,Sun Jul 5 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that it can still be plenty enjoyable playing on shit gear, but almost everything will feel different. Comparing my starter hard to my sand hats are totally differently feeling. They have such a ""sink your stick"" feel to them. High quality cymbals tend to have more flex and balance to them and you can totally feel the difference. Pedals feel totally different for obvious reasons. When something sounds and feels good my playing totally changes. Yet in the end I totally  agree that the quality of gear shouldn't be the deciding factor of how enjoyable it is."

drums,3c63yk,jondrums,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:29:03 2015 UTC,"I have flown with the nicest snare I have ever seen much less owned and my cymbals. I packed them well in hard cases and never let them out of sight. They were heavy, kept me at security longer than normal(every agent wanted to take everything out of the cases for inspection), and when my cymbal case wouldn't fit in the overhead compartment I had to keep it on my lap which was uncomfortable. In hind sight I should have just brought my backup cymbals and a good but cheap snare(my Acrolite) so I wasn't as worried and inconvenienced but for some reason I wanted to go big. All in all nothing was damaged in the slightest."
drums,3c4z9o,SokkaStyle,9,Sat Jul 4 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"Don't buy packs. You have a good base of cymbals already it seems, just add in individual cymbals.

drums,3c4z9o,Sticky_3pk,3,Sat Jul 4 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"You see, I have a very high quality set of drums, the DWs, but all of my current cymbals are Sabian B8's. So because of that, I really just want a complete overhaul of cymbals to put the quality of my cymbals at least close to on par with the quality of my drums. Because the B8's are very basic and pretty much just an introductory set."
drums,3c4z9o,Sticky_3pk,3,Sat Jul 4 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, even with B8s, its better to shop around and upgrade 1 or 2 at a time as you need. Unless you have cash to drop on all new cymbals, in which case, I still recommend avoiding premade packs just because some places won't let you open a sealed box to test."
drums,3c4z9o,Sticky_3pk,2,Sat Jul 4 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"That's true and a good idea. I guess I would be risking sound buying the packs, it's just quite a bit cheaper rather than individually buying them unless they're used.

If you have cheap cymbals, those are much more important to replace than the actual drums. Start with the hi hat and then get a good ride/crash."

drums,3c46ap,that1guypdx,6,Sat Jul 4 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"My standard advice for many issues: start with the cheapest solution first, and work your way up to spending real money, because you may not have to.  An in-round shell and decent heads are all you need to get a good sound out of most any drum. I played for years on a ""kit of many colors,"" cobbled together out of orphan drums from the back room of my local buy/sell/trade music store, most of which were paragons of quality like CB700 and Percussion Plus. I also recorded an awesome-sounding demo with my band at the time, on those same ghetto-ass drums. But you know what? With Remo heads and a proper tune, if you closed your eyes, you'd never know the difference.  Spend $50-$100 on upgrading your heads, and replace any BS entry-level cymbals you have, and see what results you get. Even if you buy new drums later, you get to keep the cymbals. You can get good sounds out of cheap drums, but cheap cymbals are cheap cymbals are cheap cymbals, and they will always suck.  Although, on the other hand, sometimes you just get tired of looking at an instrument, and it's time to move on. If you're totally out of love with your drums and feel like you need to replace them, shop used."
drums,3c46ap,TehNewDrummer,4,Sat Jul 4 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"Before I start, I just want to clarify that I'm all for making the most out of your gear, no matter how cheap or it is. I'm not in any way trying to bash OP for not having more expensive gear.  That being said, your kit sits at the lowest quality level on the market. It's great for beginners who want to discover drums, but I think you're now at a higher level.  I used to own a Ludwig Accent CS kit, which was similar to your kit. No matter which heads I used or how I tuned, it always sounded dead compared to the PDP CX kit at my school.  I strongly feel that the ""deadness"" of cheaper drums does hinder improvement, as it forces you to hit harder and doesn't really leave you satisfied with what you're playing. It also hinders dynamic control, as you can't get good resonance from quieter strokes.  Now I'm not saying you have to upgrade to a $1500 Pearl Masters to be able to improve your drumming. All you need is just an intermediate level kit with new heads. My recommendation is the Pearl Export[http://www.musiciansfriend.com/drums-percussion/pearl-export-fusion-5-piece-drum-set-with-hardware]. It's a solid kit at a great price point,  and will provide you with the resonance and sensitivity you need."
drums,3c46ap,TheUnclescar,3,Sat Jul 4 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything this guy says. I had very similar issues with my old guitar and bass guitar. They get the job done for a very beginner, but once you pass that starter phase its just hard to feel good with what you are doing due to the low quality of instrument.  I agree with you that its time for an upgrade, beginner quality just isn't working for you anymore, Though I do agree that unless you play professionally, a professional grade instrument (with a professional grade price tag) is redundant and unnecessary. Mid range sets are very good, and major improvements over beginner quality. though I'd recommend looking into the PDP concept series. I used to own a pearl export, and now I own a Birch PDP concept series set, and I hands down prefer the PDP. They are same quality range and about the same price range I'm pretty sure, but between the better hardware design [tom mount especially] and better sound I have been able to get from it, I find it so much more enjoyable to play, and set up, than my pearl export set.  5 piece Birch $680 [http://www.guitarcenter.com/PDP-Concept-Birch-5-Piece-Shell-Pack-111390852-i3904453.gc]  6 piece Birch $780 [http://www.guitarcenter.com/PDP-Concept-Birch-6-Piece-Shell-Pack-H93064-i2943515.gc]  5 piece Maple $730 [http://www.guitarcenter.com/PDP-Concept-Maple-by-DW-5-Piece-Shell-Pack-109456376-i3032503.gc]  6 piece Maple $880 [http://www.guitarcenter.com/PDP-Concept-Maple-by-DW-6-Piece-Shell-Pack-H95563-i3032501.gc]  from experience I highly recommend one of these sets over the Pearl Export. I use the 4 piece Birch (for the 20"" kick) and then I got an extra top tom and floor tom making a 6 piece set with a smaller kick drum. :)"

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for others.   David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University have postulated that the effect is the result of internal illusion in the unskilled, and external misperception in the skilled: ""The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.""

drums,3c2izn,iamabootdisk,4,Sat Jul 4 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh thanks for the info. This sounds like an inexpensive entry level kit. Fortunately drummit can make almost any drum sound good.   Your stock heads are more than likely made of a thin, non-dampened cheap plastic. It's common for those type of kits. They're really hard if not impossible to get a good kick tone out of them. Every hit is very boomy and has really weird high overtones.  You'll need to invest in new heads. and I know this will sound weird, but I recommend buying a front side or resonant head first. All of the weird uncontrolled ring and resonance is coming from this side of the head. You can get by with the batter side being cheap for right now because a small towel or pillow will dampen up the tone a lot.  I guarantee if you go buy an Evans EMAD or Aquarian you're still going to be dealing with the awful resonant head ruining your tone.  Take note, for about $70 or so you can buy package bass drum heads, front and back, from Remo and Aquarian that should be in stock at your local Guitar Center. This is the best option."

drums,3c2izn,Velocicrappper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:38:06 2015 UTC,"The heads are probably tuned too tightly.  Remove them both and start over.  Tune them just tightly enough that there is no wrinkle when you push on the center of the head decently hard.  Then tune the resonant head a bit tighter than the batter head to give the drum some body.  Make sure the heads are in tune with themselves with equal tension around the drum.    Also, some resonance (some of the boom) is desirable.  It is what carries the sound in live playing.  If you muffle the drum so it sounds, to you, behind the kit, like something you hear on a recording, it is going to sound completely dead and flat to the audience.    Also, if the drum has stock heads on it, you'll probably need to replace them to get the best sound."
drums,3c2izn,somewhat_funny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:08:45 2015 UTC,Really? I usually just have the reso tight enough to stay on and the batter on pretty tight. I like the response and the click rather than a boom. What style do you usually play?

On top of that, but a blanket (less dampening) or a pillow (more dampening) INSIDE the drum. And get a new head, double ply if you want more thump and less tone. I recommend Evans EMAD2, but you can use whatever you want."
drums,3c2izn,SpaceFlightNavigator,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"Get a nice new head.  I suggest for rock/metal/pop the Remo Powerstroke 3 or the Evans EMAD head.  Tune the batter head (the head you hit) nice and loose.  Take your hand and apply slight pressure to the center of the head and tune up till you can hardly see wrinkles around the drum (not tight, but just as it goes away), and tune the reso head (the front head) up a little more, and fiddle with the tension on that.  Stick a pillow in it before putting both heads on and you should be good to go."

drums,3c1zjq,montageofheck,3,Sat Jul 4 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"You don't have to take my word to literally. All my point was was just too groove. There is nothing wrong with tabs, you should use whatever tools you want to or think you need to learn.  I knew a drummer who was obsessed with every note being in the right place, but he couldn't hold down a beat for his life, every time he'd play a fill he'd break the beat. His playing was impossible to follow.   Imo, a little of everything helps. Tabs, music, listening to the songs, watching videos of the drummers playing the songs. That last one could be crazy helpful, i remember when i was a teenager and obsessed with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and discovered an instructional video Chad Smith made where he breaks down their songs. He had Flea with him playing the tracks. Just seeing how his body moves when he plays and watching what drums he his was such a help to me. See live concerts too, i feel i soak up musician's the best when i see them in person.  I don't know quite what i'm talking about anymore lmao. I guess what i mean is there really isn't a ""right"" way to do it. Learning an instrument is about finding the method to your madness and discovering how you solve those rhythmic and melodic problems. If songsterr works for you, than don't listen to what anyone else says. Although in my opinion you should always reference the original recording.  If you like songsterr, you may also like Jellynote, i use this site mostly. I've been trying to record my own version of an album, and the sheet music from this site has been so useful"

drums,3c1zjq,montageofheck,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:20:50 2015 UTC,"As long as you have good rhythm try playing basic beats over songs you like. It will still give you great satisfaction, and after playing them a lot of times you will remember key points and start adding those in. I would've never advanced as a drummer if I didn't just have fun with it and groove along with great music.  Electric or acoustic kit? If it's acoustic, just get a good isolating headset (or if you can't, play lightly over your headphones or something), if it's electric I'm sure there's an AUX port:)  EDIT: Also! Drum covers are great for this. That's what I used a lot in the beginning when I just couldn't figure out what they did in that one fill or groove. You will very quickly start picking up patterns and fills that are used everywhere, and different methods of playing."

I use this a lot when i write music or am transcribing something and trying to figure out the tempo.  Don't worry, being good at anything takes time. My old art professor once said you have to spend 10,000 hours of practice at something to become a master. So practice, as much as you can, learn as much as you can in any and every way.  My neighbor used to complain about my playing non stop the first year i started practicing. But after a while, once i'd learned how to hold down a beat, he rather started complimenting my playing. I think right now, i'm a passable drummer; it isn't my first instrument and i don't practice really that much anymore.   But my point is as useful as music can be, there really isn't anything that will help you more than just some good, long practice"
drums,3c1zjq,totestoro,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"it's just kinda discouraging to think how long it'll take for me to get good, but oh well. Jellynote says it needs a $5 upgrade or a monthly payment, do you know if it has enough drum tabs for it to be worth it? It looked to me like there wasn't very many."
drums,3c1zjq,Dent18,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:49:36 2015 UTC,and the reason is like a metronome with the tab program is that it's hard to get them started at the same time

It's frustrating at first, but you'll notice patterns, have eureka moments, and eventually, you'll be able to listen to something and immediately have a really good idea of how you'd play it.  One of the stumped moments for me when I was new was part of the beat at the very beginning of 311's ""Come Original,"". The bulk of the song isn't too hard, but the little flutter of 32nd notes (or 16ths, if you're going with Chad's implied double time) between the hi-hats/kick and snare drum ghost notes stumped me for so long. ""Is it all on snare? Is it all on the hats?""   Finally getting it and noticing yourself being able to hear faster is such a great feeling. Don't feel bad about using tabs right now, but start trying to learn by ear."

Just don't worry too much. When I first started I used to pour over live videos and examine the drummer every second, worrying that he was hitting this crash versus this crash or playing this fill here....it really doesn't matter, and it's important you play parts with some level of individuality  Oh and the tabs on Songsterr fucking suck also. Half are done by programs that make one up based on the guitar part, and a quarter by people who can't drum, and a quarter are done by actual drummers who typed it out. And half of those are overly complex and use weird-ass notation and interpretations"

It's honestly my dream vintage kit  As far as the Pearl masters goes, it'll have a pretty different sound.   I'm not a massive fan of Pearl, but the masters series is a set of drums that I DO love and have had the chance to record and tour on.   I can say that it's honestly apples to oranges because it's comparing ""new sounding"" drums to a vintage kit.   I will say I'm more of a fan of this kit than I am of the masters.

drums,3bycyq,J8l,4,Fri Jul 3 07:47:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you speak to. But for me, having been a Zildjian player for 11 years, Istanbul (and I find this true for Bosphorus as well) knows how to create a real authentically dark sounding cymbal while using minimal grams. Zildjian's darks and lights are becoming brighter and heavier. And with most folks loving to crash on rides, having something lighter allows for that. Even some of their lower end models in the bottom tier agop series are so inexpensive yet produce a killer sound. Bottom line, they sound sexy."

drums,3byl1d,PokeSoxx,22,Fri Jul 3 05:32:36 2015 UTC,That's a very vague question!! Try listening to your fav drummers and playing their fills. Try putting in rests or space where you normally put strokes. Try changing your drum set. Try a different drug before you play. Or be a boss and don't play any fills. You don't have to play fills to be a good drummer. Also try playing naked.
drums,3byl1d,Archerisjustok,9,Fri Jul 3 06:09:29 2015 UTC,"Naked drumming has made for some akward moments in my past.  HOWEVER, it is so much fun."
drums,3byl1d,Nicuttah,4,Fri Jul 3 11:42:40 2015 UTC,The problem I have with this is that when I was a kid I only played when people weren't home. If I were to have played naked I wouldn't have heard them come home and it could have been very awkward.
drums,3byl1d,MZago1,6,Fri Jul 3 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Playing naked is one of those liberating experiences everyone should try at least once. It's just... fun. And comfy, unless you have horrible aim with your snare hand."
drums,3byl1d,abacacus,7,Fri Jul 3 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"One thing that really opens up variation is adding the kick drum to your fills. It adds a lot more texture to fills when used effectively. The other thing I would say is copy your favorite fills from your favorite songs/bands/drummers. Copying in music is a good thing. Take fills you like and get to playing them. Eventually you'll find yourself adding your own creative twist on them, thus making them your own. Hope this helps!"
drums,3byl1d,JohnnyIvory,4,Fri Jul 3 06:06:45 2015 UTC,"Muscle memory can also be a bad thing. You get to a point in a song and your brain tells your body ""execute fill now"", and your body plays the same fill it did 16 measures ago. This is normal in every drummers development. You took the time to learn those fills and they are committed to muscle memory. Now you think they are boring.  Try playing different styles of music to get you thinking different. Calipso will open to reggae and country. You might not be able to play it but Prog rock will give you ideas. As you apply these styles to your memory, it might give you more variety to your fills. Like I said, you are going through a normal part of development. And a lot of drummers quit at this point due to boredom. Let's hope you don't. Keep practicing and learn to imagine a different fill in advance to playing it, and know how to do it without ever having played it."
drums,3byl1d,Phiction2,3,Fri Jul 3 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"Try playing melodically.  But that1guypdx, drums are a rhythm instrument and have no pitch!   I know. Hear me out.  Pick out some of your favorite hooks in a song - could be a vocal, a guitar or bass hook, anything - and play its rhythm as a fill. Play the tune of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" on the drums. Or your favorite sports team's fight song. Or a jingle from a local TV commercial.  In other words, stop thinking like a drummer, and it'll make you a better drummer."
drums,3byl1d,that1guypdx,4,Fri Jul 3 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"I felt this way once upon a time. I decided to try messing around with dynamics. Try playing a straight LRLRLRLR and add some accents on some of the notes. Randomly. Keep experimenting. Eventually start throwing the accents on to a tom instead of the snare. Put on your headphones, pop on a good tune and play along WITHOUT playing a beat. Just do fills and try to embellish the song, be the ""2nd"" drummer. Try buying some brushes too!"
drums,3byl1d,killerhatz55,3,Fri Jul 3 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"whether you want the variety to be in considered composition or in your improvisational playing, there are two things which will provide desired results:   learn as many concepts as you can and learn to apply them. practice the rudiments.   you need to expand the way your mind conceives rhythm and you need to develop the vocabulary with which you express it.  the best way to ensure you're not doing the same thing all the time is to have the most number of ways to say what you want.  think how few words we'd have if the english language only had six letters in it.  a few of easy ideas to start the ball?   change the starting and/or finishing points of a fill.  go over the bar line. mix note values. play the fewest notes possible.  play the most notes possible. change the voicing; change your starting point; change the directions in which you travel around the kit. incorporate cymbals, especially the hats.   have fun and good luck!"
drums,3byl1d,jazz_hands_jAck,2,Fri Jul 3 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"Practice practice practice. But seriously listen to your headphones, play along with something super easy. I would suggest a current pop song. Taylor Swift or some crap. The reason is it's usually a simple repeating easy beat. Then create a simple fill. Slow it down and dissect it. Then build on it and speed it up."
drums,3byl1d,drumzombie,2,Fri Jul 3 10:38:27 2015 UTC,"Fill generator:  DrumFill by MKdrums.  I think its on both iPhone and Android.  Also play every rudiment around the kit and actually use it.

drums,3bx6ij,Soulstem,18,Thu Jul 2 22:00:30 2015 UTC,So this crash cymbal had reached the end of its useful life. I have had it for years and years. In a final blaze of glory myself and a few strangers at the shooting range gave it a great send off with .223 and .45 rounds.  It actually sounded cool shooting it. I should have recorded it.  I took it home and put it back up with my full kit and hit it a few times just for shits and giggles. It sounds awful and is dangerously jagged and sharp.

That being said I would think that heads and really nice cymbals would be a better investment. Switching my cymbals to Byzance inspired me to play more.

drums,3bwu4x,lovestoserialkill4,16,Thu Jul 2 20:22:46 2015 UTC,I stumbled upon this https://youtu.be/769dD5caLmE yesterday and I think Antonio does a good job of addressing the questions you're asking here.   To me what makes a good solo is coherent musical ideas or motifs that tell a story and is appropriate to the style of music. A boring solo is one where the drummer is regurgitating a bunch of the chops they've been practicing.
drums,3bwu4x,GauchoAmigo,6,Thu Jul 2 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"I wish i could give this more votes! A solo is a mixture of intellect and technique... While each adds infinite possibilities, intellect will always trump technique. Hence Buddy Rich, while possibly the best ever technical drummer -clearly lacked musicality...(for the lack of an easier word) and could never be thought of as the most expressive... or, best drummer.    As if that title even matters."
drums,3bwu4x,lngtimelurker,4,Thu Jul 2 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"You have to make music. Some of the greatest jazz drummers of all time failed to do that in their solos. They played the shit out of the drums, don't get me wrong, but in my opinion, a solo should be a song. That means there has to be a form to it. There has to be repetition, variation, and dynamic changes. Musicality is the difference between a great solo, and the part where the sax player goes backstage for a smoke. You can have the fastest hands in the world, but that won't make your solo interesting. Especially if you play fast the whole time. Drums are probably the hardest instrument to play a great solo on because there are no notes, scales, there's nothing to limit you except the tempo. So if you want to play a great solo, play the ""melody"" on your drums. Follow the rules of music that the other guys have to follow. And then go out a little and people will shit themselves."
drums,3bwu4x,EatsRedditors4Lunch,3,Fri Jul 3 00:24:52 2015 UTC,To me a good solo does this:    keeps the form of the piece  plays varriations on the head keeps within the style   Those 3 elements are what i try to do in my solos as i think it best musically expresses what i want to get out to the audience while still being musican about it.

drums,3bwu4x,macaulay_mculkin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of what makes a solo is your audience. You can put together a musical masterpiece full of the most intricate and creative rudiments out there, but if your audience isn't full of drummers, how do they even know what the rudiments are? All they know is the sound. Keys to good solos are introducing enough of the technical with the simple that the audience can follow. For the audience to follow, it also has to sound good and most of what you'll notice is that solos become musical pieces on their own. You have a beginning that sets the tone so to speak, a middle section which typically builds to the end where it simplifies but intensifies. For example, if I threw an amazing tom groove into the beginning of a solo and people could follow that, should I abandon it in the middle, or build it up to the end of the solo? 99% of the time, your audience is not full of drummers. What makes the solos good for non drummers is that you display both physical prowess (being able to hit things fast and many at a time) but give them enough to be able to enjoy the sounds. One of the better ones I have seen recently and it was linked here is the drummer for Gojira. He did an amazing job. It should be page 2 or 3 by now, give it a watch."

It's not all invented in the hour, yes there might be improvisation but to play the faster stuff and nail it right and on the spot you usually have to practice it till you get it right :) That doesn't mean, ofc, that improving isn't good or fast either, it can obviously still sound great and be fast, it's all up to the drummer, there are obviously ppl that can't improvise well or that can't improvise amazing things right off the bat but improvising can still sound very good! But ye, most of those impressive and good sounding solos you heard in the movie had to obviously be rehearsed to be played well :D I've never done a gig, at least not a proper one in ages... and I mean 3/4 years and back then I sucked :p but since I've been a better drummer I've never done one and if I were to do one I'd only use solos I've practiced at home that I know sound good and I'm ready to do it. Trying to improvise on the spot, at least for me, would most likely lead to disaster as I'd get off the right beat and whatnot, so ye I'd only play stuff I knew I was going to be able to play properly and that sounded good :D"

drums,3bxnep,CuriousTripper,4,Fri Jul 3 00:22:51 2015 UTC,Dude... don't rent a kit. Not even factoring in the hassle... you can get a perfectly serviceable gigging kit for a few hundred bucks used.  Buy good/pro level cymbals as you can afford them. Don't even bother with budget/entry level stuff... waste of money since you'll want/need to replace them quickly.  Drums though? Cheap... heads... tune... gig.

drums,3bxnep,GOTaSMALL1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:01:24 2015 UTC,It really doesn't matter. Seriously. Probably best to stick with a name brand and you want to get the highest quality and most complete kit you can afford... But it really doesn't matter. I played major tours with a rotting piece of crap I bought at a yard sale. Any kit that's not beat to hell will sound perfectly fine in a bar/club. Just put some good heads on it and learn to tune them.   Advise I give everybody asking this question is get the cheapest drums you can find with the best cymbals you can afford.

Do you have any good instrument shops (especially one that specializes in drums) near you? Cymbals are very individualized as far as taste goes (what I like might not be what you like),  so I would suggest you go into one and test them out for sound, quality, tone, etc. that suits your taste and budget. Even if you don't buy that day (or even from there), you can figure what your goals are."

Evans is just my personal preference, you'll have to figure out for yourself what you like best!   Edit: Also, for the snare I absolutely love the Evans Genera HD Dry Snare head with a 300 Hazy head on the bottom. And for the bass, I break away from my predisposition to use Evans heads and use an Aquarian Superkick II. The thing is a cannon."

Unfortunately, I don't think he's done a series on tom heads (yet?) Keep in mind of course that these were recorded with really really nice drums, so they probably won't sound as fantastic on lower end kits. Still, getting rid of the stock heads will do wonders.

drums,3brwba,thegreenvalley,3,Wed Jul 1 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"Signature: Paiste's brightest, most most shimmering cymbals. They're so bright, they have an almost airy sound. Made from B15 bronze.  Signature Dark Energy: Dark but still crisp and definite. Comparable to Sabian HHX. Also B15 bronze.  Masters: Dark, smoky, hand-hammered cymbals. Great for jazz and blues. B20 bronze.  Formula 602: Originally manufactured in the 50s and 60s. Classic sound with a distinctly soft feel. B20 bronze.  Formula 602 Modern Essentials: The most expensive ""production line"" cymbals on the market. Developed in collaboration with Vinnie Colaiuta, designed as the ""people's cymbal."" Kinda like K's, but more rich and full. Incredibly versatile. Made from B20 bronze.  2002: Classic, bright rock sound. Used by John Bonham. B8 bronze.  Giant Beat: Classic, rock n' roll sound. Warmer and mellower than 2002. B8 bronze also."

I have the TD-6SXT, purchased new with a throne, extra cymbal (2nd crash) and new PDP double kick pedal, and it cost me ~$1,200 over 6 years ago. I see used ones go for ~$400.  It's a decent kit, and I had a 15 year lull in playing. I would play religiously in the 1990s, stopped around 1995 and didn't get back into it even a little until 2009. Even now I'm rather lax in playing, but hopefully after my family moves I can find more time, and hopefully set up the old acoustic kit again too."
drums,3bu00s,Arch27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"That looks like the equivalent of what, a TD-11KV?"
drums,3bu00s,abacacus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's nearly the same as the TD-11KV as far as I can tell - at least that's the only one sold these days that's similar. The heads are all mesh, not solid rubber pads. It has a rather unnatural bounce to them, but doesn't feel dead like a practice pad."
drums,3brpve,TheSpeedOfLove,3,Wed Jul 1 16:42:57 2015 UTC,"Hey /r/Drums  I bring to you my refinished drum set, which was inspired by Neil Peart's new R40 drum kit! For reference this drum set was purchased about four years ago, when I was still in high school, from a classmate who played drums. To this day I still don't know what brand they are, or how old they are.   I've never been happy with how they looked, and within a short amount of time I was really itching to get a new set that was a bit nicer. Although I held out for four years, and survived with what I had. Overtime I replaced all of the cymbals (excluding the hi-hats), and the stand hardware / foot pedals.   When I found out that I could refinish my own drum set, I decided that was something I would enjoy doing. Around that same pictures of Neil's new R40 kit were beginning to surface, and I thought it'd be super cool to attempt to create a replica of his new kit.   In the beginning I wanted to include the red oblongs, with album cover logos in the middle on each shell, but as I quickly moved through this project, I decided it would be to hard, and time consuming to do so. Technically my drum set cannot be considered a replica now, more so an inspiration. Either way, I wasn't going to be able to replicate Neil's awe-inspiring kit, as he has way more drums than I do, and a larger checkbook.   In the end I splurged, and purchased a new set of hi-hats, a splash cymbal, and a nice DW drum throne! Up until now, I've never had a proper drum throne, for the first two years I used an old guitar stool, and then moved on to a swivel bar stool.   I hope you guys like the work that I have done! I am pretty proud of it, and really happy with the result! let me know what you think."

I have mine plugged into my lappy and use garage band to record/edit and it works great! Hope this helps."

drums,3btg0m,youshumans,2,Thu Jul 2 00:46:55 2015 UTC,"Hi! I would suggest you go to the music store and select a bunch of different cymbals in your price range. Grab a Paiste, a Zildjian, a Meinl...what ever they have.  Most music stores have a couple of kits set up and if you are a serious buyer they should let you put the cymbals you picked out on one of those kits. Jam a little bit. Try ALL of them out. Decide which one YOU like.  Consider the kind of music you play and listen for which cymbal sounds best for that style.  I highly discourage buying gear just because a lot of other people play that particular brand. Find your own sound.  Let us know what you end up with. Have fun!"
drums,3btg0m,SKIN_BEATER,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:04:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :) Unfortunately I totally forgot I posted this and ended up buying a Meinl splash and Meinl crash. Hopefully they turn out to be what I'm looking for lol

They aren't cheap so be sure you know what sound you are looking for. As someone else said i would highly recommend getting a good ride. If you have any questions i like to consider my self not the best drummer but knowledgeable with cymbals.
drums,3btg0m,OneHandedPaperHanger,2,Thu Jul 2 06:15:44 2015 UTC,"I do have a good ride. I ended up getting both a Meinl splash and a crash as well. The only question I have is how the heck do drummers hit the cymbal so fast but so lightly, I'm a beginner (obviously) and that's the one thing I cannot get better at lol"
drums,3btg0m,Mantilla_Root,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:21:06 2015 UTC,"I would recommend playing at a very low volume to a metronome. Start really slow and ramp up speed over a few months. Focus on getting your strokes to be clean, consistent and soft. It may also help to do accent exercises to help with general dynamics control."
drums,3bt5tq,Kinkymoose5,4,Wed Jul 1 23:00:18 2015 UTC,Take it outside and hit it. If it doesn't buzz like that it's the room you are in. Sympathetic vibrations are the cause in 90% of cases.
drums,3bt5tq,M3lllvar,3,Wed Jul 1 23:47:39 2015 UTC,There's something buzzing somewhere in the extremely cluttered room my drums are in every time I hit the kick. It has been the bane of my existence for the last couple years

First off, are you in a lounge band or the show band?  Lounge bands is just hours on hours of covers 2-3 sets on the nights your on, but low stress besides the fact that you'll get really sick of the songs.  Show band is a whole other list of responsibilities.  Be prepared to sight read and learn a LOT 80+ pages of music on cruise #1.  The shows when I did it where played to a backing track with an in ear click.  If you're lucky those who came before you have transcripted good notes on the pages and fixed any errors where the music doesn't match the recording, otherwise expect a little more friction as you get used to it.  You'd also have to learn some intro/outtro stuff for entertainers and the cruise directors, but that's usually piddly stuff.  Otherwise, pretty fun. Beers are cheap, you're not too much for responsibilities and I bet the internet is functional now in a way that it definitely wasn't when I did it.  Cheers!"

drums,3bqyuj,cvad7,13,Wed Jul 1 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"Seems to be only one actual commenter who's actually done the gig. I did it for a few years but stopped about two years back. I played on RCCL and the gig itself is a piece of cake. If you can play your styles, keep decent time, play to a click, and sightread (which would be the most demanding prerequisite). I've never ran into a bad band leader from horror stories I heard, but then again I can play the fuck out of the drums.   The real challenge is coping with ship life. I would recommend doing at least one contract just for the positives: free time to read and study whatever it may be, a chance to see the world (I've been to over 20 countries thanks to ships), gaining those gig chops from daily playing, a chance to get in great shape with the time to work out, no extraneous costs e.g. bills or rent, meeting beautiful women (or whatever you're into) from around the world (just don't fall in love; I learned the hard way), cheap beers, and the camaraderie of your ship mates.   The negatives are also huge: the food may be free but it's geared toward pacific and west indie islanders, practically no privacy, really no chance to practice on a live kit very often, living under corporate rule 24/7, falling in love with your crew mates and them leaving never to be seen again, battling to not let others' ""darkness"" consume you as it's really easy to be negative about your situation.   All-in-all, I would recommend 100% that you try it. If you can hack the actual gig and the initial learning curve, it's truly the experience of a lifetime. There's not a day that passes where I don't think of a ship friend or ship experience. The drumming on ships seemed to be ancillary compared to the other experiences.   I quit for several reasons, but one of which was I found better gigs on land. If you approach it right, it can really help you grow as a person and a musician.  PM me if you or anyone else wants to know more! I'd be happy to chat."

drums,3bsxi2,Olifurr,6,Wed Jul 1 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"If you leave it off, be EXTREMELY careful of the bearing edge.    Honestly, I would cut off all the head of the ripped resonant head, except for a 1-2"" strip all the way around the edge.  Put it back on the drum, and put the hoop back on and tension it lightly.  This will protect the bearing edge and keep everything rattle free."
drums,3bsxi2,Velocicrappper,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:08 2015 UTC,This is what I was going to say.  Even if you want no front head at all its better to cut it away and leave a bit for the hardware to stay in place.  Also helps protect against the drum going out of round from new stress on the drum where there wasn't before.  Won't happen overnight but if left that way for years it can affect things.

drums,3bsxi2,DontClapOn1and3,0,Thu Jul 2 16:58:18 2015 UTC,Leave it off. It will rattle like crazy if you try to put it on. If the style of lugs on the kit have inserts then the lugs might rattle too. You can fix this by putting tape over them or by putting cotton inside them

drums,3bs19b,Joshdecent,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:26:39 2015 UTC,Makes sense. What would be the difference between Iron and Speed Cobras?
drums,3bs19b,LS_DJ,2,Wed Jul 1 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"The weight of the pedal, footboard length and (I think) the angle of the chain.  The Speed Cobra is lighter with a longer footboard, a more angled chain and different stock beaters. It does not come in cam shape variations equivalent to the different IC pedals ( Rolling glide, power glide, etc)  Both pedals have identical parts for footboard height adjustment, beater angle adjustment and the cobra coil. It will essentially come down to which pedal you like the feel of more, because they are essentially the same in how they function. Both are superior to the Iron Cobra Jr."
drums,3br12q,MastaShaker,6,Wed Jul 1 13:27:26 2015 UTC,Go to ebay.  Search for your item.  Sort for sold listings.  Now you know how much people are willing to pay for those pieces of equipment.

drums,3br12q,Cheungman,3,Sat Jul 4 12:26:58 2015 UTC,I think its like 40% the original cost +depreciation based on wear
drums,3br12q,theothernameplate,2,Wed Jul 1 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"40% is dipping kind of low as a general rule. I buy and sell a lot of used gear and depending on the item (and condition) I've sold between 50-80% of the original retail cost. I have baselines for different types (cymbals, drums, sets, hardware, etc) but I don't start at 40% on any of them."

drums,3bs6jn,WhiteTrashRedditor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:42:37 2015 UTC,I think that's a Ludwig Rocker... kind of beginnery level kit. With that many drums and cymbals/hardware I'd probably go $500-600 for that kit.

drums,3br5vx,JakeDC,3,Wed Jul 1 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"Select wood is a term for cheap wood with ugly grain patterns used on budget wrapped kits.  It's not pretty enough to be lacquered, but as far as I know it doesn't really hurt the sound.  I'm not an expert on any specific kits, but if you can't find an 8 inch 1989 Export tom, you'd probably be good with a newer Export tom.  It wouldn't be a perfect match, but I've heard that Exports in general sound pretty consistent, and they are supposedly a lot louder than most drums."

drums,3bqg5q,h4rlequ1n,5,Wed Jul 1 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! I can lend some advice on the cymbal front.  With giant beats, I found the options quite limiting. They do have a very big, classic kind of sound, but they only have a small variety. I turned my head to 2002s mainly due to the large range and variety (all different sizes, thicknesses and effect cymbals too).  Paistes go really well with Ludwig drums. There is a reason so many drummers made that link. I have a 15"" 2002 sound edge hi hat that complements my LM402 snare drum very well.   Hope this helps!"
drums,3bqg5q,trollbias,3,Wed Jul 1 13:53:25 2015 UTC,I have a Keystone kit and I really like it. Their is a significant price difference between the Keystone and the Classic maple so if you ever want to add different sizes the price could be a road block. The classic maples will hold their value very well. I can't speak for the sound of the classic maple but I am very pleased with my Keystones and the craftsmanship is really top notch. Both are american made if that matters to you.
drums,3bqg5q,dmccauley,2,Wed Jul 1 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"I also opted for a keystone kit, 24/13/16/18 in orange glass glitter and they sound amazing. If price is an issue at all I think the keystones may be better bang for your buck, but if I was going all out I'd opt for classic maples."

drums,3bmkny,Scott555,7,Tue Jun 30 21:12:19 2015 UTC,Your trip is clearly not long and strange
drums,3bmkny,LS_DJ,2,Wed Jul 1 01:47:58 2015 UTC,It's all about what floats your boat. I'm sure you listen to some music that people don't enjoy at all either.
drums,3bmkny,Scott555,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Maybe more than most. In fact you can probably say most people wouldn't enjoy most of the music that I do.  Regardless. I can be objective, and it's with the most objective posture I can manage to muster when I ask, ""What the hell do people get out of the Grateful Dead?""  I also realize I'm updating an anonymous message board with my opinion about a band, and I nearly had to punish my 14 year old son for doing the same thing to excess. I do believe I'm done here."
drums,3bmkny,LS_DJ,2,Wed Jul 1 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"I would say it's similar to enjoying ambient soundscape type music. They start off with a rockish countryish song and then just let the musical conversation flow and see where it goes. Very similar to jazz music, there's sort of a central theme and they riff and solo around it. It's also very docile and pleasant vibes, they rarely have anything that is dark or brooding. A lot of their fan base did come from the pshcheldic era where you need long winding journeys to listen to as you explore the depths of your trip  It's more of a mood than anything else in my opinion. I love the dead. But I also love phish and moe. and umphreys mcgee"

He likes to keep extras around just in case, my guess is he accidentally grabbed an old extra Evans head when gathering a set.  For anyone interested we're a small recording studio based in Marion, Iowa. Our website is riferecording.com. We're in the middle of updating it so a little information is still outdated. OP took the (good) photos for the site."

drums,3bo2bg,EliQuince,2,Tue Jun 30 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"Are the bare hardwoods good for acoustics? I guess it depends on what you're going for, but it seems like carpet would offer better absorption"
drums,3bo2bg,MeEncanta,2,Wed Jul 1 05:01:33 2015 UTC,"It's all about the sound you're looking for. Hardwood allows for more accoustic reflections offering a more ""live,"" reverby sound, while carpet absorbs more of the sound waves producing a deader sound. In studios, drums are usually put on a rug or riser to help absorb low frequency rumble which is undesirable for recordings. The rug/riser in a acoustically reflective room helps the drums sound fuller while eliminating the low end rumble. I'm not the best at explaining things but I hope this helped."

drums,3bonhj,Cheungman,2,Wed Jul 1 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think there are much better offerings in the prog/math metal world.   ABR seems to rely quite heavily on basic time signatures, and their songs tend to hang out below 160 BPM which isn't a crime or anything, it just all sort of runs together from solo to breakdown to solo to breakdown etc..."

drums,3bonhj,Cheungman,-1,Wed Jul 1 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, but at the same time, ABR aren't really a prog or math metal band.

Their music has become more and more precise and layered, adding in unique elements to make songs memorable as opposed to countless others in their genre.   I would argue that the intensity has actually grown but ABR have found a way to emphasize varying dynamics in their music so that they can build and swell each track rather than staying at a 10 the entire time (again, unlike countless other bands in their genre)."

I acknowledge that his work on the first three albums were fun and technical enough to be quite interesting but the music has gotten stale and uninspired. Facts are hard to swallow, not opinions. Your opinion doesn't negate my opinion. Where you hear ""more and more precise and layered"" I hear bland and marketed."
drums,3bonhj,Cheungman,2,Wed Jul 1 15:04:45 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the old west groove thrown so smoothly in the middle of a metal core song is anything but uninspired. They have moments like that all over the new album. I'll concede that the last couple albums have just been so-so but this new one stands out, in my opinion.   Also, Matt's hardly on a pedestal. I only have two drummers on pedestals in my brain: Darren King (Mute Math) for his unparalleled groove ability and Thomas Lang for soloing flavor."

drums,3bpq3z,JoeMagnifico,3,Wed Jul 1 04:24:08 2015 UTC,"They are good and I would consider them collectable - especially with the Ringo fans (I have a '65 kit as well, but in White Marine Pearl and smaller sizes).   As mdsirrine mentioned, it does appear to be missing some of the original hardware, so that will knock down the value a bit.  Totally a guess, but I would think everything in that condition would be in the $800-$1000 range - I could be totally off though, so hopefully some others pitch in since I haven't really bought/sold kits for over 10 years."

You won't find anything with that note layout because that isn't how actual lead steel pans are laid out. But nevertheless, it looks like a cool toy to have around as an ornament or to play some simple tunes on. (I would recommend you play lightly, as that instrument you have is pretty fragile.)  Go to the hardware store, buy some wooden dowels about half-an-inch thick, cut them to about 5 inches long, and put surgical rubber tubing on the end to make mallets."

drums,3bp1c1,Jujudrums,2,Wed Jul 1 20:01:06 2015 UTC,"Another easy way to check if it's still in tune is to strike the lower note and if the note an octave('s) above it sounds, you're in pretty good shape! Also for mallets, try strapping a bunch of rubber bands on the back of a heavy stick and using the rubber end. Nice find btw!"

He likes to have long sections where we both improvise a lot. We have been doing this for over 20 years and things are more or less second nature.

To learn the rudiments on their own you don't really need a book, though there are plenty of great books containing solos that utilize the rudiments like Charley Wilcoxon's ""All American Drummer"", though you'll really want to get comfortable with reading and with your rudiments before diving into that book.  Vic Firth's website is an excellent resource for learning the rudiments, complete with notation as well as audio and video demonstrations and practice tools.  Above all else, find a good teacher in your area. It helps so much just to have someone right there in person to point out your flaws, give you some tips and set you on the right path. Good luck!"

drums,3bp4gf,person9,3,Wed Jul 1 00:31:04 2015 UTC,"Heh, 'djembe' rope is kind like wedding favours---three times more expensive because you're adding 'djembe' to the name.   Go to a climbing store and ask for static/non-stretch cord. Regular climbing rope has a bit of stretch/bounce to it (as in, if you're rope is about to save you from a fall, you don't want it to go taught all at once).   But they also have a tone of different ropes that are meant to have none of that--the kind of thing you'd tie your gear to and whatnot. A benefit is that it comes in all sorts of colours and patterns. And sizes, too--you'll find very thin rope, but don't go so thin that it cuts into your head.    Note: I'm not a climber, but I have been reheading my/friend's djembes for about 20 years or so. Not a professional re-header, just the biggest fish in this tiny pond.    Advice-wise, what are you looking for in a first drum?"
drums,3bp4gf,Rhythmdvl,2,Wed Jul 1 13:56:57 2015 UTC,"I play guitar and a bunch of other instruments and have just started doing repair work on various things.

Just was suspicious that rope would fall into that first category!  Thanks!  I don't know if I have a climbing store locally but I'll go ahead and check around.    Well some things I'm having a hard time seeing from various guides.  When to tell if the hide is being stretched too far, shape of the lip of the drum, any misc advice weaving a head on and tightening when not using a top ring(probably looping through the hide itself).  Or if you meant what am I looking for in a first drum it's just a small one.  Just looking for something that could be played in the lap while sitting and have a good variety of sounds to it.  Later on I may be interested in making some various kinds of drums both traditional and modern but for the first just something to play with."
drums,3bp4gf,Rhythmdvl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"The percussion is kind of a side thing for inbetween those projects.   Be warned. Djembe and other hand drums/percussion are extremely addictive. The above quote indicates your susceptibility!    I've figured out there are a lot of overpriced tools and supplies Raw shea butter is fantastic. You can get a lot of overpriced, cosmetic-like or nicely packaged stuff, but raw shea shouldn't set you back very much. Look for a fair trade or small collective organization to buy from to feel good about it. A little lasts a long time.    If you're going to be doing more than the occasional drum or your arms are a bit wibblywobbly, consider a rope puller. Not too expensive ($30), and if you're handy you can make your own. It's great for getting things super-tight on the first set of verticals, and great for tightening things without rope digging into your hands. There are also inexpensive hand-held rope pullers available at boat shops, but I've relied so much on that puller and a broom handle (to wrap the rope around) that I can't say much about them.   Done right, though, you shouldn't have to do much more than a diamond or three, mostly with the change of seasons or big shifts in humidity.   I've lucked out and never had a hide break when first putting it on. In the process you want it to get pretty tight, but not in tune per se. (Of course, there are a thousand ways to do it, so this is experienced-based opinion.) Key to everything is patience. Take it slow so you can focus on keeping things even (both tension-wise and keeping the head level on the drum).   Most of the drums I work with have a nice rounded edge. That's not too vague, is it? I rub a candle along the edge first, but that's mainly because that's how I was taught. Since I've always done it that way, I can't tell if waxing helps the process or is a useless ritual.   I've always used a to ring, so can't offer specific advice if you're punching through the head and using that for tension. All I can think of is to tell whoever you're getting a skin from that that's what you're doing and need a thicker head."
drums,3bp4gf,Rhythmdvl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:55:46 2015 UTC,I understand they're addictive.  My primary goal is to learn to build and repair string instruments(as well as play a bunch of them) but the percussion seems to be something I can do with the majority of the tools I have on hand as long as I don't get TOO crazy.  I'll probably start with a good solid piece of bamboo as a puller since it's what I have on hand.  If I start doing a lot of drums I'll look into a specialty puller!  Well I have some parafin wax that I use to lube my saws(when I remember to before cutting!) so I'll go ahead and rub a little on.  Can't hurt.  Thanks!

However their elongation chart is as follow  Elongation: @ 300 lbf. = 13.3% Elongation: @ 600 lbf. = 18.7%  Since in the application I""m using them in requires less pressure and length than that I'd assume it would stretch less as well.

drums,3bn5my,TSIjoeC,2,Tue Jun 30 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"agreein on that. When you learn to play drums and you get used to hitting and controlling the rebound, you have to relearn that when you're 'high'. There was something I read about smoking messing with your 'normal network' (?) or something. Basically anything requiring fine motor skills and coordination will have to be 'relearned'.  I've experienced this as a newb to smoking one night at a club. The sound guy smoked the band out and it was way too much for me. About halfway through our set I said we have to get of stage but our singer insisted on finishing. The higher you are the worse it is, so if you're an experienced smoker and you just take a few hits to get a little buzz, maybe not a bad idea, otherwise I think a drink or two should do the trick.  I was lucky enough to have my first musical performance in 6th grade band class in front of the entire school. That scared the hell out of me but when I started playing shows in my own band I never had to deal with nerves"

drums,3bkcu5,eleanor61,2,Tue Jun 30 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree on finishes too. I play in pop bands and am routinely at Namm every year for being a professional drummer/studio guy so I see all the amazing finishes. And I'd play this thing to! It's a great finish. Out of curiosity, how did the rainbow become the symbol for gay pride? I know I could google it, but why not ask someone who's actually gay. And what are your thoughts on it being the official symbol/flag of gay pride? You also have to realize that unfortunately due to our society full of marketing every inch of everything and how we've become conditioned to immediate brand/logo/symbol recognition that if someone had a finish like this on all of their drums that I'd guess 7/10 people would immediately associate that the drummer probably being gay (this could be total bullshit I realize that). Of course like I said before there's nothing wrong with that and it's definitely someone who's completely confident in their own sexuality would rock that no problem. These are the thoughts I have. Oy."
drums,3bkcu5,RedshedTSD,4,Tue Jun 30 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"I believe the rainbow is used to signify the diversity of the LGBTQ(etc) community, and the inclusiveness of said community. Since queer people have historically been discriminated against, I think there is a certain unity and stick-togetherness within that community--whether you're young or old or white or black or yellow or brown or male or female or anywhere in between, there's a safe place for you where the pride flag is flown.   That said, the first thought that popped into my head seeing this snare was not at all ""gay drummer."" Rainbows are pretty universal. I'm straight but have a biblical name associated with the rainbow, so it means something special and unrelated and personal to me, but I'm also glad that gay folks have selected it as their banner because I think the symbolism is really good."

drums,3bnp6e,DarkNostril,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeesh, best of luck but it's gonna be a lot of work tracking down the correct hardware for that kit. eBay will be the most straightforward solution. Searching for things like ""vintage"" or ""slot mount"" in addition to ""Pearl tom mount"" will help narrow the search.   The main problem is on the kick's end, honestly. Tubing that thick (or thin, in this case) is very uncommon nowadays. So if you go with a retrofit instead of the old OEM mount you'll need to be aware that the tubing you need for the kick is very undersized by today's standards. Also that retrofitting that bracket will more than likely require drilling the shell.   Finding a solution for the rack tom is easier. I'd second the recommendation of getting an Optimount for it since it'll most likely be the easiest and most straightforward option, but it also might be just as cost-effective to just get a snare stand for it and solve both problems at once."
drums,3bnp6e,that1guypdx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"Use a rim-mounted suspension mount, and hang it from a cymbal stand with a multiclamp. Those old types of tom mounts are rubbish.

I painted this kit: http://imgur.com/a/XqfFA... Pearl Export so not too different from your CB's. Not exactly a rattle-can job though :)  After you strip the wrap you'll want to use a grain filler (the trowelable stuff they sell for wood floors) and give it a good sanding. Then just pick your color and go.   One word of warning... you can only use enamel clearcoat over enamel paint. Urethanes and Lacquers will crack that shit right off.

After hacking off the rim and filing the edges, I sloppily hammered it with a makeshift anvil (a dumbbell with a grinded surface).  Because of my inaccuracy and a lack of a bell, it's very dark.  It's not really suited to be a ride because of how thin it is, and its sustain is terrible for a crash, so I primarily use it in a stack.  It was a fun learning experience.  Here's a soundclip of it."

drums,3bkr56,jorahhasbadideas,2,Tue Jun 30 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Stop burying the beater. Lift your toes with the pedal movement and let it come back smoothly.   Seriously. Even if you think you aren't doing it. I had the same problem for ages, never figured it out.... until I triggered my kick. Suddenly, popcorn everywhere, until I relaxed the hell out of my ankles. Made me more powerful at 230+ too."
drums,3bkr56,abacacus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"When you say relaxing the ankles, are you talking about using a different muscle group to make it happen or is it just using a more passive motion to send the beater to the head?"
drums,3bkr56,abacacus,3,Tue Jun 30 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"After the beater hits the head, your ankle should be floppier than a 90 year old man after his viagra bottle runs dry. The spring tension of your pedals should be sufficient to lift your toes enough to keep the beater from bouncing off the head a few times if it's the end of the kick run, and it helps get a full, powerful motion in the middle of a run."
drums,3bkr56,reggaejames,2,Tue Jun 30 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll see what I can do with my tension and work on that then.  Thanks for the advice, and the chuckle."

drums,3bihzo,STYLIE,10,Mon Jun 29 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"a 24"" won't make that much difference volume wise.   if volume is an issue at a gig it's probably more the amps and not your drums, and in my experience it's cymbals and snares that will kill you in smaller rooms, not the kick."
drums,3bihzo,jawshoeuh,6,Mon Jun 29 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"Past a certain point, probably 20"" or so, the size of the bass drum effects its tone more than its volume. You should be fine."
drums,3bihzo,racefan78,6,Mon Jun 29 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"I second this. OP is best off to rock a 20 or 22, put a kickport in it and/or use a plastic beater for extra attack, and mic it if at all possible. Or tell the guitars to turn the hell down."

drums,3bk3m5,queensinthesky,3,Mon Jun 29 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"First off, check the local places.  Not guitar center, but people who are local that own shops.  If they're of good reputation, it wouldn't hurt to go talk to them and see how they can adjust the price if you see a kit that you like.  You may get lucky and they may be a dealer of a brand that you really like.  For second hand kits, you're good to check local places for trade ins too, even places like Guitar Center.  I advocate local places because I ordered a kit online, it was a Gretsch Catalina Maple 6 piece, and didn't sound like what I paid for it while being damaged.  Basically, one of the drums showed up cracked, and luckily I filmed the unboxing so they couldn't fight me on it.  Decided to return and try again.  This time ordered a TAMA Superstar, and the bevel on two drums were off (if I took the rim off of the bottom and pushed on one side, it would teeter).  Returned that one and took a 2 hour road trip to a place where I could play before I bought.  Long story short, I went thinking I only had a budget for a 6 piece kit, and left with a 7 piece kit of the line of drums I wanted for almost 400 dollars less than what I would have paid online, and came in about 100 dollars under my budget."
drums,3bk3m5,jorahhasbadideas,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"I was in roughly the same position as you and I ended up getting a Yamaha Stage Custom Birch (it was a great deal in 2010, they've upgraded even more since then).

drums,3bk3m5,SKIN_BEATER,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard so many good things about that kit, I always played one for my exams in the School of Music I did my grades in. Would it be a good kit for a player who plays mostly harder rock stuff, as in letlive. and heavier Led Zeppelin sort of style?"
drums,3bk3m5,smb12099,2,Tue Jun 30 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a very versatile kit. It's birch so it's not going to be quite as loud as maple or another harder type of wood, but I've never had a problem with it. It's a great quality for a great price."
drums,3bigwk,VonDenBerg,3,Mon Jun 29 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"I use a few stacks. Splashes are fine on their own (I think) as an accent. I like stacking them in a china, under or over a crash, or on each other as like little tiny hihats.  You might want to try a splash with a Zildjian Oriental Trash. They can be had for under $100 and are awesome."
drums,3bigwk,lord_of_vader,2,Mon Jun 29 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"My favorite stack ever was just a cheap Paiste 13"" crash and a splash that fit the bell as snug as possible. Sounded like a china with really fast decay, like most stacks. Might work for you."
drums,3bigwk,maxkmiller,2,Mon Jun 29 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Hey /r/drums, change my mind: I have yet to hear a stack I like. They all just sound like non-resonant metallic shit to me."
drums,3bigwk,SnareSpectre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"Have you tried recording them and listening back that way? I agree completely when you're talking about the acoustic sound, but something happens and they sound a lot cooler (to me) once you run them through mics and listen to them in context."
drums,3bigwk,abacacus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"They're all about white noise. Short, harsh, loud. Kind of like a really trashy china with almost no decay.  They don't shine well in most music, but where a stack is needed, nothing else will work as well."
drums,3bigwk,maxkmiller,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:37:13 2015 UTC,So gimme some examples
drums,3bigwk,lord_of_vader,2,Tue Jun 30 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"You should check out Aaron Spears play ""Caught Up"" on YouTube. He makes use of a killer China stack on his right side. I'm on my phone but he's wearing a red polo in the video.   Also check out Moving Parts by Benny Greb. He uses a stack on the intro of that tune that sounds really cool.   Edit: Back at work! Aaron Spears and Benny Greb."
drums,3bigwk,maxkmiller,2,Tue Jun 30 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"This Spears one just sounds like you took all the resonance out of a china, not that great or even trashy sounding. Always loved this guys' work on the toms though, unreal.  Greb's sounds like what I would expect a stack to sound like, and I see where it has its place, but it still just sounds kinda like tasteless metal to me."
drums,3bigwk,abacacus,2,Tue Jun 30 17:27:37 2015 UTC,Halpern makes amazing use of a stack in this video.

I'd check out this one: http://www.cymbalfusion.com/sabian-hhx-6-piece-praise-cymbal-pack-demo/  Back when we did Sabian, we had a lot of worship guys who were happy with this configuration. Particularly the ride, an HH or HHX RBDR is pretty much perfect for a church set."
drums,3bi5kk,GreenbrierMusic,3,Mon Jun 29 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"I have a ton of Evolutions and I love them. They're dark, but they're not jazz dark and have a ton of room to fit in almost any style, including jazz. I would go with the HHX's personally, but I find most AAX cymbals to be a bit on the bland side for my taste."
drums,3bi5kk,Joshdecent,3,Mon Jun 29 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"I've been using AAX-plosions for years now (going on around 5-6), and I literally just cracked my 17 inch crash last week. Went back to the music shop, bought an exact replacement, and added the 16 inch and a splash, all in the same series. I play in a cover band that gigs on the regular, and they've never let me down. Would recommend for days! :)   Happy hunting!"
drums,3bi5kk,TSIjoeC,2,Mon Jun 29 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"AAX X-Plosions user here. Mixed with auxilary AAX Stage hats and Stage ride. Playing with that arsenal for like 2-3 years (lots of shows, 99,9% metal gigs).  If you try to groove alone or work on your dynamics, you may find that AAX X-Plosion hi-hat is a little to bright and ""glassy"". Stage one was even ""worse"" so it ended as semi-closed aux hi-hat :) This opinion is based on my ears and my teacher's ears.  When you play with quite loud band AAX Sabians are just like ambrosia for the music. They really shine on stage, rehearsals etc."
drums,3bi5kk,doles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:58:54 2015 UTC,"I've had my evolutions for about 10 years now.   I love the crashes,  the ride is alright.   Never had the hats.  The crashes have a great warm sound that works well with a lot of styles.   They're not great for really heavy hitting,  so if you beat the crap out of your cymbals I'd recommend something else.    That said,  mine have been abused quite a bit by other players and don't show any wear.     The ride is fairly heavy.   You get a decent range of sounds between the edge and the bell.   It has an alright crash.   I really liked the ride,  but it doesn't fit as well with my current setup."
drums,3bi5kk,fretsofgenius,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:05:01 2015 UTC,Sabian makes a AAX worship pack for people who do a lot of church drumming and whatnot but they're still AAX nonetheless so you'd definitely be able to get the rock sound out of them as well. You should look into that.
drums,3bi5kk,im-not-greg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:36:18 2015 UTC,Don't buy in a pack if at all possible
drums,3bi5kk,SKIN_BEATER,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:02:08 2015 UTC,I ended up buying the AAX pack. But why would you advise against it?
drums,3bi5kk,SKIN_BEATER,3,Tue Jun 30 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, well in that case, good for you man! Hope you enjoy.   I just said that because its better to buy cymbals individually to get the sounds that you like, rather than to be pigeon-holed into the sounds the company has chosen for you. However, if you like the sounds of the cymbal pack, good for you, its way cheaper to buy that way! Have fun"
drums,3bi5kk,thedeadlyrhythm42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:25:31 2015 UTC,I definitely hit on the ones that hey had out on display. I wouldn't have bought them without hitting them!!
drums,3bi5kk,ZachPlaysDrums,2,Tue Jun 30 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"That's good that you did that to get a feel for the character of the cymbals, but I think he meant to hit the specific cymbals you are going to buy. Every cymbal is different, regardless of the name on the bow.   Anyway, the AAX pack looks like a solid buy. You really can't go wrong with any of those packs from what I can tell, as long as they fit the sound you're going for.   Happy drumming to you!"

drums,3bhmac,whitesox14,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Not really, bass drums sound good without, toms however do not. In my opinion anyway. If you want to hear them just search concert toms."

I grew up on Latin music, specifically salsa, and love it."
drums,3bgupg,Irish_McIrishson,3,Mon Jun 29 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"Latin drumming is a big, big world. If you are looking for Afrocuban music, one of the first bands that started to incorporate drums was ""Los Van Van"". Changuito played drums and basically inventend the ""Songo"" For something more modern you could look for any ""Timba"" music, it's pretty intense.   This is a clip a particularly like, Jimmy Branly killing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_34oDF6ZIs  If you really want to learn the tradition, you would have to check out other styles like Danzon, Son, Rumba Guaganco, Cha Cha Cha, etc, etc, etc  If you are looking for Brazilian stuff, one drummer I really like is Kiko Freitas, beast, beast drummer.  Brazil has a lot of different styles like Samba, Bossa Nova, Maracatu, Afoxe, etc, etc,etc.  Usually when people talk about Latin Music they tend to talk about Afrocuban and brazilian styles but there are a bunch of different countries and music, like Chacarera, Zamba (Argentina), Candombe (Uruguay) Festejo, Lando (Peru) Joropo ( Venezuela), Merengue (Dom. Republic) Bomba (Puerto Rico), etc, etc, etc, etc  For Metal stuff, Martin Lopez (Ex-Opeth) blended pretty nicely the Metal an Latin world. Another band that comes to mind is Sepultura, specially the ""Roots"" Album.  Hope this is helpful!"

drums,3bfukq,Chris_tinaRita,4,Sun Jun 28 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"How bearing edges effect the sound: think of everything you currently attribute to the shell material; that's how bearing edges effect the sound. Wood species actually has relatively little to do with it (yes wood species matters, but not nearly as much as quality of materials, bearing edge, and heads).  Anyway, it's pretty uncommon to find shell packs with both a 22"" kick and a 14"" floor tom (as the biggest/only floor tom), so you'll likely have to do a little shopping around and order a kit in that configuration. Further, 22x16 kicks are exceedingly uncommon nowadays without going with a high end kit (i.e. $2000+).  But, if you're flexible, you can easily find kits with either a 22x18 or 22x14 kick in that price range. I'd take a look at a C&C Player Date (maple/mahogany), a Gretsch Brooklyn (maple/poplar), a Ludwig Keystone (maple/oak), and a Pearl Masters MCX (all-maple). Again, most of these won't be available with those sizes in pre-packaged shell packs, so you'll have to order a kit pieced together from components."

We're also doing 10% off for kits created through our web store which I'd be able to honor if your purchase directly from us.  We use 5 ply Keller Magnum Maple shells for this line that sound warm and huge. Our default edge is a round over edge with a slight 45 degree on the inside and a full round over edge on the kick. This is the same edge that were used on vintage Slingerlands. However, we can do any edge you request.  We can do any size you want with a variety of custom finish & hardware options to choose from. Check it out on our site here. PM me or email me at danny@ccpercussion.com  if you have any questions!"

However, it has a 22x18 kick, which doesn't exactly fit your specs. I would still highly recommend a try.  I haven't really seen any recent kits with 22x16 bass drums. The Ludwig Classic Maple has a 22x14, but most kits out there have 22x18."

It is a lot for the left hand to tackle but it stays on the snare so the right hand never stops giving you a steady pulse of those 8ths even when he goes to the snare with it.

drums,3be864,vrmptns01,2,Sun Jun 28 11:52:39 2015 UTC,"As far as hoops, wood vs. metal is simply a difference in sound. I would see of you can find a drum with wood to try out, and pay special attention to how rimshots and rim clicks sound as they are most impacted by wood rims If you think the sound fits your style, go for it. As for snare wires, larger snare sets will dampen the sound, giving it very short decay and not much snare action. As you are playing trip hop, I would assume you do a fair amount of small ghost notes and delicate snare work, so a less wide snare set might be better, as you'll get more action out of smaller taps on the head. Another thing to take into account is snare beds. This is the small indent in the bottom of the drum shell where the snares sit. Snares shouldn't exceed the size of the bed. Don't be concerned if your drum doesn't have one though, that's not uncommon either."

Honestly, if I'm listening to a drum solo, I'm expecting something much different than I would if I were listening to the drum track behind a piece of music.

Art can find its own even in the seemingly mundane. Not to say that the control of Joe's left hand was mundane by any measure. It was magic, but one must be open to it for it to be so.

Everytime they hit a rimshot (which is quite often for a lot of guys) it pushes the rim down just enough to release the tension on the tension rods and let them spin (semi) freely. After hitting a few hundred rimshots, halfway through your set you end up with an out of tune snare drum.   I've seen it personally. After a few songs, the rods on the front left of the snare are totally loose.   edit: Just saw the top child comment already explains this. I'll leave it."

drums,3bcpfm,steverocksvh,9,Sun Jun 28 00:12:18 2015 UTC,Listen until you never want to hear them again.   Most important tip right there. You'll sit down to play the song and you'll already know over half just from listening so much

drums,3bcpfm,ADamnGentleman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"Having just done something very similar, I feel for you. My friend's dinner band had their drummer run over by a forklift at work, so I had to fill in. I was recruited last sunday for a 7pm-11pm show this last wednesday. 34 songs. (I only messed up two of them, aw yeah!)  I'm willing to bet they don't expect you to play note for note or even the exact patterns for each song. If it's a straight rock song, learn where the fills and the pauses are, chart the general dynamics and then just make sure to hit 2 & 4 everywhere else.   Put a fill where the song has a fill, doesn't even have to resemble the actual fill unless it's an iconic one like In The Air Tonight. Stop playing where there's no drums.   For swing do the same thing, but with a swing pattern instead of the backbeat... although a backbeat on those probably isn't unwelcome. Latin's trickier, but most people don't know the difference between a clave and anything else, so you can probably get away with just a clave pattern over... well.... a backbeat unless you want to come up with something more clever.  People like backbeats.  Write down the style, chart out the dynamics in a basic way and then just play within your skill level and trust yourself."
drums,3bcpfm,Tiki_Lamp,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:20:38 2015 UTC,Damn and I thought my 5 songs in a week was tough. Just keep listening to the song over and over again until your ears want to kill themselves.
drums,3bcpfm,Infamaniac23,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"As other comments say, they don't expect perfection. Filter and focus on your weakest. Practice the beginnings of the songs you start with a count in. And write a cheat list of them."
drums,3bcpfm,Phiction2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:20:19 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate your intuition. I play a lot of random gigs and cabaret type things. Good songs are most of the time pretty intuitive. Listen to them a ton and just do it. It's easier than you think, and nobody in the audience will know the difference. If they do, just tell them you didn't like the way the original guy did it.   Most important thing for drummers in unrehearsed gigs is to keep it moving."
drums,3bcpfm,eric33190,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"Seriously dude it's a cover band. Go with the damn feel of the song. 99% of the crowd won't have a clue because they're probably going to be eating dinner. If they are paying attention to the music, they'll probably be drunk by that point.   I'm not saying don't prepare...I'm just saying don't be overly stressed. I doubt you guys are playing Porcupine Tree or Primus so just brush up on the typical bar bullshit and what the set is. No one expects perfection for a bar gig."

Basically just get comfortable with the skeleton of the song and let your natural groove take over. Again this may or may not be good for you, but most church bands will be casual enough to let you go off the rails a bit, just listen to the band and go with it."

drums,3bdm1j,drumsarelife,5,Sun Jun 28 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"Double check your technique and make sure you're not tensing up too much! When you play at faster tempos, it's more efficient to use smaller muscles (wrists and fingers as opposed to forearms and shoulders), which means a looser grip and a greater reliance on the drum's natural rebound. Try playing slower with the loosest grip you feel comfortable with while maintaining form and control, and slowly increase tempo. The point is to be able to play at that fast tempo without putting so much work into it that your shoulders are being affected. Good luck!!"
drums,3bdm1j,too_rare_to_die,2,Sun Jun 28 07:57:25 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this, also, warm up! Do some shoulder circles if that's what your having problems with. And remember, it is easier to play fast if you're relaxed!"

Maybe the drum is too low? I know when my practice pad is laying somewhere like the table or something and I walk by and play a few licks it feels really awkward on the left if it's too low, because on my pad I always play traditional with marching sticks.   The only reason I ever got a pad was to attempt to get into marching in college so I'm used to playing trad on it, but I generally use match on kit and anywhere else."

drums,3bb0fj,TheHappyCampperr,4,Sat Jun 27 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"You can do lots of things to improve your left hand.  I used to do the following when learning ""traditional"" grip:  -Watch a few tv shows practicing different rhythms at different tempos and volumes.  I would get distracted alot and start plinking around a bunch, so I would then put the other stick in a different room so I could focus better  -try playing left hand lead on all fills.  So instead of RLRRLRLL down the toms, I would play LRLLRLRR so it forced my mind to give my left hand equal importance.   -Practice your less confident rudiments with left hand leads first.  Get them comfortable and THEN work on right hand lead.  -Lastly, I used to play all my grooves with either left hand on high hat, or right hand on high hat.  This again focuses your attention to the driving force behind the groove.  Now I do all of these things with my left foot as well.  It has helped A TON.  The key is not doing just one exercise, its all about diversity and balance when it comes to drumming."
drums,3bb0fj,Nicuttah,2,Sat Jun 27 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"UGH, of course! Thank you! I see it comes to diversity and balance in all things, so of course this would apply to the drums. My seriousness must have narrowed my mind. In an attempt to increase my speed, I would just use various rudiments with various tempos on the snare only. I wasn't giving my mind the whole picture. I should be wary about this with other things in the future."
drums,3bb0fj,TerrapinForest,3,Sat Jun 27 19:18:25 2015 UTC,Lead with your left in life. Start with brushing your teeth. This will help the brain part of it immensely. Not even being funny.
drums,3bb0fj,kageteishu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"AH, I have heard this somewhere before. I believe you. Good advice, although I am sure practicing more couldn't hurt."
drums,3bb0fj,Forevenless,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:31 2015 UTC,"Play rudiments right hand lead on a slower setting (90bpm) then left hand lead but try doubling how many times you play those rudiments. Here's an example...   'Paradiddles' 80BPM - Right Hand Lead 4 times / Left Hand Lead 8 times.   Then slowly speed it up and do the same over and over. Try to focus 'only' on the base rudiments at first, like Paradiddles (all), Flams (Taps and Flam Triplets), and Single/Double stroke rolls."
drums,3bb0fj,ar0nic,2,Sat Jun 27 15:09:43 2015 UTC,"Careful there. Firstly, grip should be held as a separate issue. Playing 16ths with your left won't correct your grip. You say you were using improper technique for two years. Have you had this corrected? If you haven't you'll be playing 16th notes without any change to your previous grip, and you'll just be solidifying bad technique.  You need to first concentrate on gripping the stick correctly. Tommy Igoe has a section on this in his Great Hands For A Lifetime DVD and I'm sure there are other reputable videos on youtube for this issue. Jojo Mayers DVD too.   Ideally you want a good teacher who can immediately point out and try to correct your grip.  Once that's out of the way, you actually are thinking along the right lines and the 16ths idea is an effective one, building from slow tempos to faster once you're comfortable.   Personally I'd use the  Stick Control book. It's helped my left hand a lot. You could either do the exercises as written or maybe focus on the ones with more left hand stickings in them. It's a very boring book to practice but worthwhile. Replacing the metronome with music is an idea to make it more fun. I sometimes do it with some good, solid four to the floor music like disco or House/EDM."
drums,3bb0fj,ZachPlaysDrums,2,Sat Jun 27 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"i took the approach if i can do it with my right i should be able to do it with my left, thus i practice everything open handed and cross. cross is dominant but i like to launch fills from open handed sticking."
drums,3bb0fj,VeryCoolCat,2,Sat Jun 27 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"When I started thinking that I needed to work on my left hand, I just started playing a ton of ghost notes on the snare in my grooves. I know that doesn't sound like it addresses anything, and maybe it doesn't.  But, playing that many ghost notes in a groove sounds like shit unless they're... ghostly (quiet). You almost have to just let gravity bring the stick to the drum and control it with your hand, and I think doing that over time helped my left hand grip. When you play like that you're not really squeezing the stick as much as you might when you're playing louder; if you're grip is bad you'll feel it and naturally start correcting it to something that doesn't strain your hand as much.  And the good thing about building up your left hand this way is that once you have a good feel for playing quiet ghost notes and you have them going constantly, it's like you've got a whole new layer of sound in your playing."
drums,3bb0fj,CreeksideStrays,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:04:05 2015 UTC,it's small but i remeber hearing gadd or buddy rich or one of the greats saying you should practice beats/grooves/what you like to practice but simply lead with your non dominant hand. might not be the fastest way or most scientific but it worked for me!

He broke his wrist I believe and then worked it so he had a left side pedal that became his snare. Probably a pad, but blew my mind."
drums,3bb0fj,JakeeRase,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't really seen anyone address your main question here: grip. Grip varies slightly depending on your style of playing. For instance, a jazz drummer will hold a stick a bit differently than a hard rock drummer.   To simplify, ""American grip"" is right between French and German grip. Most of the time when people pick up a pair of sticks (even for the first time) American grip is what, by default, feels most natural. Your fingers should be connected to the stick, but not so tight as to prevent the stick to vibrate upon hitting a drum.   My next piece of advice is to pick up the book ""Stick Control"" by George Stone. It is a standard for drummers and percussionists in general. It involves a huge collection of sticking combinations that favor both hands pretty much equally. Make sure you read the instructions in the book, as it is super important.  Hope this helps."
drums,3bb0fj,jorahhasbadideas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:58:57 2015 UTC,I recommend this book by Matt Savage. It goes over all the rudiments  with different exercises for all of them to develop your dominant and slave hands. It also comes with 2 CD's with play along tracks.
drums,3bb0fj,WheresMyChip,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"When I began strengthening and getting used to my left hand leading while my right became supplemental, I went through a lot of exercises in Marco Minnemann's Extreme Independence, The New Breed by Gary Chester, and Open Handed Playing by Claus Hessler.  Of course, you could find the pdf of stick control and find patterns that use the left more than the right and begin going doing that."

Personally my guideline is more wrist for more power and velocity; more fingers for finesse and speed. the point that separates the two changes depending on your own abilities IMO"
drums,3bcr9i,quixotic120,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"I've had this same problem with my left hand, I learned the problem was with my fulcrum. You aren't holding the stick tight enough. Don't get me wrong, relaxation is key to playing fast but there is a level of pressure you must put on the stick to hold it in place.  Next time you play try pinching your fulcrum just slightly tighter. It'll feel weird at first because you aren't used to it but once you build it up it will feel better.   Try this as an exercise:  grab a met, a pad, and your sticks. Put the met on a moderate to moderately fast speed, for me that's around 8th notes at 120.  Hit the pad with both hands simultaneously with large, full strokes. Let the sticks rebound as much as they can.  While doing this vary the pressure on your fulcrum until you find the ""sweet spot"". It should be tight enough to control the stick but relaxed enough to allow full motion. Once you get it hold it there and continue playing for 30 seconds or so.  Stop for a min. and repeat. If you do this 5 min. a day for a week or so you should see a marked improvement.   To answer your other question, I use a ""movable fulcrum"" system.  When I'm playing slower my hands and fingers stay pretty well on the stick the whole time and my wrist becomes the fulcrum, like a hinge.   The faster I get, the fulcrum moves more toward my fingers and my hand opens up until I'm using almost entirely fingers and very little wrist."

It is perfect for what I was looking for because I use my ride as a crash just as much as I ride on it. If you want a cymbal that is more of a ride that you can crash I would get a Sweet Ride. It is a bit heavier so it has better stick definition and it has a nice bright crash that isn't too washy. The K is dark and washy as fuck.

drums,3bbn6h,drumguy17,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"Not a vintage guy, but that looks like a solid buy"
drums,3bbn6h,GreenbrierMusic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"Not a great deal. Not a bad deal. The closer to $700 you can get the better. Those cymbals are little more than pie plates, so they don't really even enter into it in my opinion. Random hardware is ok, I guess, if you need it. If you could get the just shells and mounting hardware for around $650-$700 you be doing well."
drums,3bbn6h,Hexenes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:13:03 2015 UTC,Thanks!
drums,3bbn6h,PRESIDENT_DICK_BOB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"Not a terrible deal.   I just got the same kit but it was a '76 for about $650 and it only had a kick, 1 rack Tom and a floor tom. Sizes are a bit bigger though.   Heads up, when you get it, it'll probably have this weird gray plastic-y looking stuff on it that will make you think the drums are composite.   They aren't, that's just a paint called granitone that ludwig started putting inside their shells in the late 60s I believe for ""sound enhancement"" (kind of like gretsch). But it's still maple/poplar.   Edit: NVM it looks like yours doesn't have it."
drums,3bb6o0,cbwyatt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:25:30 2015 UTC,I'd say go for it! It'll be a fun project to fix up and make your own.

drums,3baj3d,JuJoker,3,Sat Jun 27 10:06:45 2015 UTC,"Difficult to say. Even the cheapest ""real"" drumsets are not that cheap. Maybe look at the Pearl Export series, or Pearl Target. I don't have experience with either, but I have experience with Pearl and I feel like I can trust their quality."
drums,3baj3d,SchartHaakon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:36:44 2015 UTC,What's your budget?
drums,3baj3d,Ze_Messiah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:06:49 2015 UTC,"Hmh, it should be cheap. So I guess from 150€ to 350€? I know it's nearly nothing but all I can affort and I really want to play drums. Sadly we don't have a music school or something like this in my near :("
drums,3baj3d,SchartHaakon,3,Sat Jun 27 11:35:34 2015 UTC,"You can get a decent beginner kit with that budget, and I assure you it's worth it! Drums has been a gigantic joy and therapy for me the last 10 years. There's nothing quite like grooving the hell out on the drums, you should look forward to it:) Good luck!  Sidenote: To get you extra hyped, and a good headstart you should check these channels out:   Drumeo (Lessons and much much more) COOP3RDRUMM3R (Inspiration and lessons) Alex Ribchester (Lessons) Cobus (Inspiration, my favourite channel when I was a beginner)"
drums,3baj3d,fkaReeves,2,Sat Jun 27 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude I'd go for a pearl kit, something made in the last 10 years too at that budget. With a bit of good tuning and good heads you definitely can have a good sounding drum kit that will be fun to play :)  My first kit was 350  Australian dollars and tuned nicely is a fantastic bedroom piece.   Something important in beginner kits is to make sure whatever Hi hats you end up with are firm feeling and don't flex too much because it will mess with your technique.  There's heaps of guides on YouTube to get a beginner kit to sound good and I'd also recommend checking a pillow in the bass drum so it has a punchy sound instead of ringing out, and finding a way to make sure the snare drum doesn't ring out either(good tuning or moon gell helps with that )  Good luck!!"
drums,3baj3d,Ze_Messiah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"Look on ebay and craigslist for some decent used stuff. I would recommend pearl, Yamaha, mapex. At that budget you won't get much but there are some solid kits out there at decent prices second hand.  Think about what cymbals you are getting as well as they make a huge difference to the sound of the kit. From my experience the stock pearl cymbals are cheap and thin."
drums,3baj3d,senpaimaster,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"Craiglist dude, or look around online. I got my drums set, 2 cymbals, stands, hithat, drum throne and even a pair of sticks for 300euro. Used is the way to go for starting out"
drums,3baj3d,WayByWind,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Even entry level Tama kits and hardware are high quality, based on my own experience and discussion with others. A used Tama Imperialstar or Rockstar might be a good bet if you can get cymbal stands as part of the deal.  Edit: I neglected to mention that during my first year I used a snare, 20-year old hi-hats and a sturdy cardboard box with a kick pedal attached to it to learn the basics. Consider similar options while you start out (probably with a real bass drum) and put more into your budget if you decide to stick with it."

drums,3b8mt0,Drumhead89,3,Fri Jun 26 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"In some cases it could be cheaper to buy similar used drums and take the lugs off them. I've bought multiple snares and toms at thrift shops for anywhere between $3 and $15. I bought an old pearl export kick for $20 once.   If I may ask, why do you need to replace the entire lug? Without knowing your problem, I'll just say that there are many ways to revitalize rusted, pitted, messed up lugs. If the tension rods won't screw in anymore, you can just replace that little piece without needing to replace the entire lug.  Edit: re-reading your post it seems like you might be going for a different style of lug. Is that right?"
drums,3b8mt0,thedeadlyrhythm42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"The most cost-effective way of replacing lugs is to buy a donor kit.   Next would be buying generic or inexpensive lugs wholesale from places like Drum Foundry, Drum Maker, Precision Drum, etc.   And finally would be buying OEM lugs, which can range anywhere between $5 to over $10 per lug.   Hardware ain't cheap. And remember too that you need to find lugs that fit your kit's hole spacing unless you want to drill new holes yourself. Those measurements aren't standard."
drums,3b78sh,Donglish,5,Fri Jun 26 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like a 60s Japanese knockoff of a slingerland kit. The interior pictures show three reinforcement rings and vertical ply luan mahogany, both of which are hallmarks of these ""stencil"" kits. It looks to be refinished as well, so unless it's under $200 it's probably not worth it."
drums,3b78sh,willnsam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the help. He wants 250 for it so I'll pass then. I just really liked the finish. I have a similar kind on my main kit but it's black and gold."
drums,3b78sh,mdsirrine,2,Fri Jun 26 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Gretsch actually, maybe Slingerland. All we really have to go on right now is the hardware. The lugs definitely don't look to be Ludwig, Premier, or Rogers.  The tom mount on the kick doesn't look familiar.  I assume this is the only pic they posted on CL?"
drums,3b78sh,schmults,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:12:41 2015 UTC,He sent me these photos when asked what kind of wood it was made from. He said mahogany with maple reinforcement hoops.  http://imgur.com/a/4UCHq

drums,3b7twk,Ratamacue172,4,Fri Jun 26 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"According to ""sold"" listings on eBay, you could be looking at roughly $1500-2000 for just the drums.  There could be added value, but I can't say; as I am no Yamaha expert.  In a craigslist market, it may be hard to find someone willing to pay on the high end of that estimate.  DON'T bring it it a Music-go-round or local used instrument dealer; you'll get far less."
drums,3b7twk,whatsthehappenstance,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"rt. In a craigslist market, it may be hard to find someone willing to pay on the high end of that estimate. DON'T bring it it a Music-go   Yeah, I know taking it to a music shop will get me nothing but raked over the coals on the pricing. I'm going to hold out for someone who is dedicated to these particular drums."
drums,3b7twk,thedeadlyrhythm42,2,Fri Jun 26 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"First off, amazing set up in that first picture. Super cool.   Just eyeballing the cymbals, I wouldn't take less than $450 combined for all of them. I'd realistically estimate:  $100-125 each for the two rides $75 for the crash $125 for the hats $25 for the small splash $35 for the larger splash  Once again, estimates. I did used to work for a retailer buying in used gear so I have a little experience but it has been a few years so I could be out of touch with the market.   edit: Prices are at the low end of the spectrum. I originally had that in the post but edited it out before posting and forgot to mention it elsewhere."
drums,3b7twk,beta_particle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:41:55 2015 UTC,100 bucks for a K ride? Sign me up.
drums,3b7twk,thedeadlyrhythm42,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, my estimates are on the low end but I think they are realistic for what the cymbals can actually sell for. I don't know the exact condition, or the location of the sale.   If I were to buy the K ride in to the music store I worked at I would have tried to get it for $50-65 bucks and then listed it for $135-150. (Not saying that's ""right"" or ""moral"", it's just the fact of the business). I figured I'd give the guy a basement price to not go under. If he lists that ride for $175 and someone buys it, awesome, but if he needs cash and gets negotiated down to $125 that's still an  acceptable price (in my opinion)."
drums,3b7twk,controversysquared,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:01:44 2015 UTC,100 bucks is about standard for K rides in the used market. I have purchased one for $110. All depends on where you are looking.

I think in-ear monitors should be a top priority, as hearing damage is irreversible.  edit: To clarify, SE215's have foam tips just like earplugs you get on an airplane, so they form to fit your ear exactly.

I also listen to a lot of Christian Rock. Jeremy Camp, Reliant K, Disciple, Casting Crowns, Tenth Avenue North.  I don't play in a band, although I do gig every once in a while when a friend of mine needs a drummer at whatever event he's playing at, that's a polka group.

My parents had divorced and no longer had the energy to continue to force me to do things, much less an expensive music education, so I was ready to just give it up all together.  Then I went and saw a BLAST! exhibition. I remember sitting in my seat as they performed ""Simple Gifts"" just awe-inspired and filled with an overwhelming desire to do the things I was seeing these musicians do. I threw myself at music that day, learning instrument after instrument, theory and composition. I began to devour works classical composers, progressive rock and rollers and jazz legends.

They were just getting started; still teenagers too and touring like crazy doing shows wherever they could exactly like that one.  They put on a fucking show!  It was amazing.  They had an incredible work ethic and energy that was infectious.  When, shortly thereafter, they blew up it was a huge inspiration.    A few years later I'd played with a ton of different bands and ended up getting signed to a very small label (all studio time and expenses paid for and we didn't have to book our own shows WOOT!) and doing regional tours myself.

Later that year my parents bought me Rockband for Christmas, and I played that game religiously. Especially the drums. I also really liked playing Enter Sandman on drums, and with the help of my older sister discovered Metallica. That was my first real influential band. My sister had also recently quit playing drums and we had a shitty $100 RB kit laying around. I decided to try play the stuff I liked in Rockband on the drums and loved it. Hate me if you will, but I still play those crap RB shells to this day (I've played much worse sounding drums), but I've long updated all my cymbals.   Come Rockband 2, and I discovered my favourite all time band - Dream Theater. It was thanks to grinding Panic Attack for weeks to get 99% on Expert drums that I took real-life drums seriously as well.   So tl;dr: Metallica and Dream Theater. Both from Rockband."

First and foremost, and I think probably everyone else who comments on this thread is also going to say it, is going to be your technique and posture.  This probably isn't new knowledge for you but make sure you're playing relaxed and not stressing yourself.  I developed tendinitis in both my biceps because I was playing songs in my band that were really upbeat and faster than I could play comfortably so I was cramping and flexing my arms too much to keep up with the songs.  I had to lay off playing and retrain myself to play with better technique and I also went back to some basics about building up my speed comfortably so when I played at those speeds again I wasn't stressing.  Next is posture.  I have degenerative disc disease in my L4 and L5 vertebrae thanks to weekly ruck marches with a 50lb pack on my back in the army.  Not to mention my posture just sucks to begin with.  Sitting up straight, either by yourself or with the help of a backrest on your throne will help with some pain in your hips when working your legs on the kit.  Make sure your kit is set up ergonomically for your body too.  I know you probably have either heard this before or already know it but try to really think about it when you play.  It probably isn't easy cuz how you learned to play for so many years is now automatic but it might be contributing to some pain.  A chiropractor might also help?  I'm going thru some therapy with one now due to an auto accident and it's really helped out some of my back pain issues too.  I hope you get something out of this and there aren't more serious underlying issues.  Good luck!"

drums,3b3nqj,Velocicrappper,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:01:13 2015 UTC,"No it's not bad technique, but I seriously injured my back last year because I was always played heel up on the kick (well 90 percent of the time depending on the song) and was always heel down in the hi-hat.    Soon I started struggling with the hi-hat speed for complicated left foot stuff and needed to start playing heel up on the hi-hat.  A long story short, I had developed serious muscle imbalance issues in my lower back, and when I started to try heel up on the week side, the strong side pulled EVERYTHING out of alignment.  I was in so much pain I missed nearly a week of work.  My hip, groin, and back were all messed up and extremely painful for nearly five months.  I basically had to relearn my posture at the kit and REALLY focus on keeping my muscles EVENLY trained.  Just make darn sure you are not leaning to one side or another while you play, even if slightly, like even just tensing one side more than other.  Heel up is fine, but make sure you are balanced in the throne."
drums,3b3nqj,Velocicrappper,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:03:15 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks! I will keep that in mind later. To be honest I do feel a little off center when I play, I just assumed it was my dominant side being dominant.  Did you have any exercises that can improve the imbalance?"
drums,3b3nqj,ChaseCroasmun,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"Anything that will strengthen your core and groin/hip flexors area.  I found planks (google how to do them correctly, not the stupid fad), lower back stretches and bicycles (basically you tread air while laying on your back) helpful while I was recovering.  Lots of good stuff on you tube for core/abs/back stretches and exercises and how to do them right."

drums,3b0mab,WolverineBlues,2,Thu Jun 25 03:18:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just don't really like it off to the side under my hats like most guys do. I played on a friends' kit and he plays his side snare up like that and I loved the feel, it feels very natural there. I'm not really reaching much and my arm falls in a very natural position. It's definitely more comfortable than it probably looks haha."

It's the combination of the long footboard, cobra coil and the fact that it's so lightweight. I feel like I don't have to work as much to work the pedal, but i'm not sacrificing power to get that lighter feel and I feel like that lighter weight working with the coil to keep the pedal under my foot at all times makes manipulating the pedal a bit easier too. I definitely recommend them!"

They did not cast their own blanks as far as I know (not that this matters in any real quantifiable way).  They had 3 lines.  Yours appears to be the ""Super"" line, which was their top of the line cymbals. Unlike their other lines, ""Super"" Zyns were B20 in composition. Very, very similar to the machine made Zildjians of the same era.  Your date is placed somewhere between 1951 and 1968 as the line was replaced with the ""5 Star Super Zyn"" series.  Great shape and piece of history. How do they sound?"

He does solos in his concerts and such. (usually it is the same 16th note shit you can search youtube and the same as what he plays at the end.) I believe the question you should be asking is; ""is the audio heard coming from what Justin Bieber is playing?"" and the answer to that is no....until the end."
drums,3b462v,drumteacher,2,Thu Jun 25 21:50:37 2015 UTC,The segments that you do see him play he seems to be playing the same beat even though the beat in the song clearly has changed. It just bothers me that I think it's fake but it seems like 95% of all people in the youtube comments agrees that he is actually playing so I thought I would ask the people that should know best

And even when it is partly because of that(Tool, Animals as Leaders), i still don't actually understand why or how it is that way, because i don't play guitar. whereas i could break it down for the drums at least..  Justin Beiber, is technically a novice...  ONLY people who do not play any instrument would seriously think he is great. It doesn't matter how much someone might ""LOVE music"", that still doesn't mean that they understand it."

drums,3b2xw0,BenMelanin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:28:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I've done that. I think I have a pretty steep angle on it which definitely helps the air escape. I'm wondering if that's what contributes to the sloppier sound?
drums,3b2xw0,champaignthrowaway,2,Thu Jun 25 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is.  Flatten it out almost completely.  If they airlock (they won't, I've seen this literally one time in twenty years of drumming) or the air pocket somehow is a problem (it almost never is), then go ahead and drill.  Either way, drilling won't change the sloppy closing sound if you've got your tilter cranked over."

drums,3b1p66,snipepe,17,Thu Jun 25 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Look up Vinnie Colaiuta and ""Seven Days."" anyway, the bar doesn't actually exist, we just use it to group things together.  Prior to about the 17th century there were no time signatures, everything was across the bar so to speak.  The best way you can get over this imaginary obstacle is to think in divisions of 2 & 3.  For example, say I want to play in 13/8.  Most people would have a hard time coming up with a good rhythm.  13 seems uneven...  but 3 isn't, nor is 2.  A smart player with simply divide it into 3, 3, 3, 2, 2.  So, you could go kick snare kick snare snare.  Or you could play 3 bars of 12/8 with an extra dotted quarter every 3rd bar.  Now, supposing the song is in 5/4, but you want to feel like 6/8, 7/8 7/8 for two bars.  First thing to do is, play a measure of standard 6/8 time, thats 3 & 3.  For each 7/8 phrase, play 3, 2, 2.  So now your groups of 2 & 3 are as follows, 33322322.  All these are 8th notes.  Put a heavy accent on the first grouping, and on the third and 6th grouping.  Kick those.  Snare on the second 3, and every group of 2.  So now you've basically written three measures, over two measures of 5/4.  Supposing you're playing 5/4 as 3 3 2 2, the sudden change in feel will be very noticeable.  If I have time tomorrow during the day, I can record it for you and show you what it would sound like. Basically, keep everything down to the smallest number.  When I'm playing with a symphony, I always count 2, 3 or 4s from each beat of the conductor's hand.  I sight read Timpani on Lincolnshire Posey and never missed an entrance or rhythm.  I had to buckle down and focus on the time very carefully."
drums,3b1p66,HurbleBurble,2,Thu Jun 25 07:42:00 2015 UTC,Any chance of a cell phone video to YouTube of you going through everything you just wrote here in front of a drum kit with examples?   I really struggle with the written music/time signature side of things and this was fascinating but hard to visualize with my limited knowledge.  It sucks being able to play hundreds of songs and not being able to easily tell you what time signature a single one of them is in :)
drums,3b1p66,Teeklin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:03:42 2015 UTC,Please do! This sounds extremely profound to me and Ive never seen it like that to be honest.
drums,3b1p66,dvlerner,4,Thu Jun 25 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"First, practice playing ""over the bar"" in 4/4. My fave is playing fills that end on beat 2 or 3 of next measure with a crash cymb with it. Once you're comfortable with that then you need to be comfortable playing odd time signatures with out the need of heavy down beats. Play your 5/4 for four measures and then for the next four measures leave your bass drum off of beat one every other measure. Another trick is to count 5/4 in 10/4, feeling two measures of time as one unit instead. After some time you'll start to naturally think in longer phrases.   If your chops are not the problem then it's how you're thinking about the music. Every solo I've done I have had a tune in my head that helps guide me through the music, instead of thinking of the specific notes. Come up with a melody or bass line you can hum that fits with your solo, and that's half the battle.  Last thing. This guys has three videos on playing like Mark Guiliana. Check it out if you haven't already. http://youtu.be/1dfhPl8bYR8"
drums,3b1p66,icantdecideonausrnme,2,Thu Jun 25 07:31:12 2015 UTC,"(In case you haven't heard of Neil Peart yet...) Neil Peart, drummer (and lyricist) for Rush, has a common part of his live solos where he plays 4/4 with his hands over 3/4 with his feet.

drums,3b2usn,phantomspecialist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"I've been playing music since elementary school, I've never met anyone who actually referred to a measure by number when there isn't sheet music in front of them. Most people I have played with will usual refer to sections as the verse, the chorus, the prechorus, or whatever else helps describe it. If they know where everything is down to the measure number, just ask them to clarify it for you so you are on the same page.   As far as feeling out the beat you really just have to drill into your head a constant 1-2-3-4 count, or whatever time signature you're playing in. It honestly comes from pure repetition until your brain can feel the count.   As far as understanding exactly what it is you're playing try to write it out. I don't always know exactly what the note value of my parts are while I'm playing them because in a band you generally go by feel instead of counting every single beat and rest. But if I sit down and write it out it usually doesn't take too long for me to figure out. I've actually discovered that we play some interesting time changes while writing it out that I hadn't noticed before."
drums,3b2usn,nitengale329,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"You apparently didn't play much studio work or big band and pit orchestra.  You have to count measures endlessly.  As to how, you just get used to grouping them.  4, 8, 12, 16, you will develop a natural feel for these.  As for odd numbers, 4+1=5.  4+3=7.  Etc."
drums,3b2usn,HurbleBurble,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"I actually did spend several years playing orchestra and in a jazz band, it was not as a percussionist, but i would imagine guy on timpani wasn't counting every beat of his 65 measure rests.   In those kinds of ensembles you would normally have sheet music. Which is why I said unless you are playing in a group with sheet music, most people won't understand what someone means when they say they want to change measure 156. With sheet music it's a lot easier to find that.   4 bar and 8 bar sections all have a feel that is easily learned from practice. So do odd times such as 5/4 and 6/8. Which is why I also said to spend a lot of time practicing counting those out until OP can feel them.   He also does not play to sheet music so I wouldn't assume he knows exact what measure number corresponds to which part of the song. That is why I advised him to refer to the common names for sections such as verse, chorus, bridge ect.  No musician I have ever played with counts 1-2-3-4 2-2-3-4 3-2-3-4.... 84-2-3-4 85-2-3-4. And so on. Especially without sheet music.  But if you do, or know people who do, then that's cool. I have major respect for someone who has memorized the sheet music that well, especially when there never was any in the first place."

drums,3b0xb4,Heisenberg720,3,Thu Jun 25 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"I would just stick to the 22 and mess around with the tuning until you find a good sound. The bass drum, unlike in a rock setting, is rarely used in jazz except for accents. It is used big band settings a lot with the toms, but by that point the sound is more bombastic and a regular rock-tuned bass drum would work fine.   Cymbals are key in jazz, and are much more important in keeping time then the snare and bass. This was a hard concept for me to learn since I started out on Rock (and still favor rock more).   If you wanna start listening to more jazz, any Miles Davis is the go-to artist for many, but stuff like Kind of Blue isn't big on drums. I got a suggestion from this subreddit about John Coltrane's Giant Steps, and that seems to be a pretty solid album in my book. Also listen to Snarky Puppy, more jazz fusion then straight up jazz but still a great band."
drums,3b0xb4,BoyWhoCriedWolfe,2,Thu Jun 25 03:09:02 2015 UTC,"I converted a floor tom into a BD for real small group gigs. It's nice and super bop sounding. But as the first comment said, bass drum isn't used as much in straight ahead jazz grooves. (disclaimer, it can be, but it's musically used as opposed to laying down solid foundation for your hands like in rock music) You can swing with quarter notes on the ride and nothing else.  I'm sure you can get a nice jazz sound with the 22. Tune higher and don't be afraid of overtones and sustain. Also consider comparing some different bass drum beaters compared to what you use in your rock playing. Makes a big difference.   And in response on how to do it, look up the Pearl JG16 Jungle kit thing. Works pretty good."

Play heel down, use a soft fluffy beater on your pedal, and really feather the head of the drum.  Also, tuning and head choice will make a difference.    The big drum is nice because when you want to really ""drop a bomb"" you can do it to huge effect.    That said, a 16"" would be an OK bass drum for jazz.

That way the rest of the band can hear it and give their opinions. If the tempo changes sound weird to you, there's a good chance they'll sound weird to someone else in the band. You could also ask him what he's trying to accomplish with the tempo changes. Perhaps there's another way to achieve an effect he's looking for that he doesn't know about."
drums,3axtot,BiggusMikus,5,Wed Jun 24 11:26:28 2015 UTC,Tempo changes are a thing rarely done well. Also it can be something that will get you guys hung up. I agree with the idea of trying it and hearing how it sounds. If it doesn't sound good you likely won't be alone.

drums,3axtot,DutchJG,2,Wed Jun 24 13:40:34 2015 UTC,"Don't overdo it though. If there is a dancing crowd, it might not work out very well I think..   My band does a few dance gigs.  Our lead guy always wants to do tempo changes in songs or do stupid shit like go double time or half time for a section of the song.  I always end up telling him, ""dude, that is not going to work for a dance gig,"" and he always goes ""oh yeah....you're right...."""
drums,3axtot,Velocicrappper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"as said before they're tricky, much trier than simply going into half or double time..    metronome use is required, preferably by the whole band.  a metronome that will tick down in tempo at a given bar would be best, giving a bar of time for the band to wind up/down or simply adjust is a great way to do it.   the band as a whole should do their best to feel out and understand what the desired end product is. often times thought of as an unnecessary complication or confusion, when done well, i love it. really makes it feel like a composition rather than just a straight ahead rock track.  song writing and structure just takes lots of practice, and a bit of know how"
drums,3axtot,OneHighGiraffa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"I've been working with a guitarist who doesn't have any music theory knowledge and the few times he writes parts at different tempos or in different time signatures it's not until we've jammed it out that I really notice, and he never notices unless I point it out to him. I think it works most of the time because it's done organically to achieve a certain feel in a part of the song. Doing a tempo change for the sake of having one is the wrong reason. If you put a tempo change, or a time change, into a song it really should be because that part of the song needs to feel different than other parts of the song."

drums,3ax3pw,McHorseParty,3,Wed Jun 24 05:07:41 2015 UTC,"Its alright, despite what they market it as unfortunately you can't work miracles and it has the pitfalls of the design/metal.  Sounds very splashy to an audience/miced up.  Sounds not bad to you.  So imo its kind of like a ride in the sense of a Zildjian Sweet Ride ...washy bright but can easily lose definition to the point of nothingness with too much power or odd shaped drumstick tip.  With that said it has better ride qualities than a sweet ride, MORE definition but its not going to ever replace a pingy ride you know.  And its not ever going to fill a room like certain crashes might.  Give and take.  I think a more normal just Ride (AAX ride, Zildjian A Ride, any cymbal thats just a ride, usually wont be too thick or thin) in something like 22-24"" might be better for both for rock/punk.  The Omni I think would work better for lower volume music and not much at all if you're battling distorted amps at stage volume unmiced/ride not miced.  At least ride wise, you might still get a decent crash but again it'll be splashy sounding"
drums,3ax3pw,wtfnecron,3,Wed Jun 24 09:24:42 2015 UTC,"I got an AAX omni less than a week ago. It has a really impressive shimmer to the crash that seems to command the room for a second. The bell is really crisp but doesnt cut through the air in a way I expected it to. I feel like most of the cymbals tones are washy and bright. I don't know if that answers your question at all, but I figured I would throw in my two cents."
drums,3ax3pw,mownkeh,3,Wed Jun 24 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't played one but I have seen and heard them live. They are a decent crash ride. I have been playing different crash rides (bosphorus traditional, sweet ride, k crash ride) in the rock, punk and metal genres. If you need definition hit the cymbal further towards the bell. For crashing, or jut a washy sound in general, hit the cymbal closer to the edge."
drums,3ax3pw,steverocksvh,3,Wed Jun 24 09:41:25 2015 UTC,"They are fantastic as a crash. As a ride, it depends on what you're looking for. The ride sound, even hit further up towards the bell, is very washy and doesn't cut very well. Usually for punk drumming I would think you'd want a ride with more ping, but of course that's up to you. If you do a lot of wash-riding, be forewarned that the edge of the cymbal is VERY thin, so watch your technique. These cymbals overall have a fairly high pitch, so again, decide if that's what you want or not."
drums,3ax3pw,racefan78,2,Wed Jun 24 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"I've been playing with one for about a year and a half now. The major things to note that would be important for you are since the main part you would ride is unlathed metal, it isn't as cutting as one may prefer for your genres. It has great definition and tone, but it doesn't cut as much. And it's a tad quieter than a typical lathed ride."
drums,3ax3pw,thecrsinger,2,Wed Jun 24 12:14:15 2015 UTC,"I've had one since they came out, and I've played many different styles with it.  Every area of the cymbal reacts slightly differently though, so it's best to be accurate and intentional with it.  Otherwise it can splash away from you..."
drums,3ax3pw,IonnaTrailer,2,Wed Jun 24 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"The lathed portion from the bow to the edge is pretty easy to bend if you play too hard, keep that in mind. I'm not a fan of the AAX model, but the HHX model is pretty awesome. I'd also recommend you check out the Meinl Byzance Extra Dry Dual Crash/Ride, doesn't have the edge bend issue as much, and I prefer the sound to both Sabian models."
drums,3ax3pw,GreenbrierMusic,2,Wed Jun 24 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"Like everyone is saying they are a very bright and also kind of tin-can like depending on where and how you strike it. Maybe consider a groove ride,  an hhx legacy heavy ride 22"" or even a manhattan jazz 22"", if youre keen on sabian?"
drums,3ax3pw,theothernameplate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:11:43 2015 UTC,"Here is a live album I cut 4 years ago with a 22"" Omni. The band was very loud, I was up against an Vox AC 30 up around 8, and a sizable bass rig. My Omni was a bit thicker than others I've played, and it was matched with 14 ""Paiste Signature Heavy Hats, and some 20"" crash, for reference. I believe our mic'ing was kick snare overhead(s), and I had plenty of bleed from the amps in the room. This should give you a decent idea of how it can hold up in a loud environment.   I did sell that cymbal as it was too abrasive for most gigs, and this particular band it didn't matter what I was smashing. Good hunting"

drums,3av1mp,0nieladb,10,Tue Jun 23 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"Metric modulation is the term for changing time or feel. To do it, you need to be able to feel time perfectly and understand where to come in again. For example: if your song is 4/4, but you solo in 7/8, every 8 bars you are back in time. Every 3.5 bars you are landing in the middle of the 4/4 bar but the beginning of the 7/8 bar. 7/8 feels very different from 4/4, but you can still play in time."

drums,3av1mp,fastballer8,3,Thu Jun 25 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"to rephrase here.. if you are in 4/4 and playing in 7/8:  It will be seven bars of 4/4 before your 1 count lines up with the 7/8 1 count.  it will be eight bars of 7/8 before your 1 count lines up with the 4/4 1 count.  If you are playing with a bassist at all or another instrument, make sure they know your intended counting as well. You may be drumming in 7/8 while they continue their 4/4 beat, which means they repeat their phrase or start the next one after they count 7 4/4 bars, even if you counted 8 bars of 7/8. Its weird math stuffs and takes some practice but once it clicks its much easier to do. Like those weird blurry pictures that you stare at just the right way and suddenly the picture pops out and you can find it every time after that no problem."
drums,3av1mp,TheUnclescar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"Are there any particular trends or rules governing this? Assuming we have 4 bars of 4 time, are there any particular norms regarding what can be played where?  Like, I'm assuming that three bars of 3/4 followed by a bar of 7/4 would feel more natural than some weird combinations of x/16. Is there a tendancy to stick to the same time signature for the duration (like the first couple of bars of Gavin Harrison's solo) or is it something that should be done spontaneously?  (I know that this is of course, all up to the player and personal preferences... but if I want to start delving into it, I'd like to have a relatively basic starting point)"
drums,3av1mp,IAmNotAPerson6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're asking. Are you saying something like is it better to do certain combinations of meters in the space of those 4 bars of 4/4 than other combinations of meters? Because if so, it doesn't matter at all.  And as a side note, there's a transcription of that Gavin Harrison solo here. It's from Terry Branam (who does a lot with Gavin) and he wrote it all in 4/4 and it makes sense, so no need for weird shifting meters in there. Maybe that could help a bit."
drums,3av1mp,M3lllvar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"I'll try to clarify a bit.  In rock music, you'll have a tendancy to play backbeat snare drum on 2 and 4.   When you're playing Latin, you have a tendancy to emphasize the clave.  Pro players can obviously break those rules and shift them for their own expression. But beginners tend to stick to those rules in order to learn the basics before changing things up. What I'm asking is ""Are there any such rules for rhythmic modulation?""  EDIT: To clarify what I mean about Gavin's solo: bars 18-20 are implied in ""7/8"". They're phrased and sound like three bars of 7/8, but is it usual to group implied time signatures together like that, or is it more common to pair them with other implied time signatures?"
drums,3av1mp,kageteishu,2,Tue Jun 23 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"Well, technically you shouldn't emphasize the clave, the emphasis just falls in a different spot. The rules are do what sounds good, and play in time. Experiment. If you want a better layout, get Mike Mangini's The Grid DVD. It covers the basics of this quite well."

drums,3av1mp,M3lllvar,2,Thu Jun 25 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"Ahh, then no. No such rules like that.  EDIT: By the way, that's not implied 7/8, he's just emphasizing dotted eighths over the bar line. I've actually tried to find out what that's called before. Like a groove where, in each measure, everything stays the same except for one thing which changes its position for each bar after that until it reaches its initial position again. Like a groove in 7/8 with the bell of the ride playing quarter notes so that it's a two bar phrase with the bell on 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the first bar and 2, 4, and 6 of the second bar. Coincidentally, Gavin Harrison calls it ""overriding."" Vinnie Colaiuta has called it ""superimposed metric modulation."" But there doesn't seem to be any set term for it.  And now that I think about it, is that what you mean here? Because metric modulation is something different. Metric modulation would be like playing something in 5/8 but then switching to 4/4 while keeping the tempo of the quarter note as fast as what the eighth note was in 5/8."
drums,3av1mp,cubine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I refer to as playing a phrase. The guys that do this don't pay attention to the bar lines, they listen to the musical phrase. Instead of 6 bars of 4/4 they play to LA LA TI DOH LA in whatever musically fits. It works well in complex time signatures and is much simpler."
drums,3av1mp,abacacus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:53:02 2015 UTC,How would you recommend someone practice getting their time to that level.
drums,3av1mp,CheeseFest,2,Wed Jun 24 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"Mostly, you have to learn to internalize timing. You play with a click and feel it. If someone can turn the click on and off randomly and you are still in time, you are nailing it. In one of my old band's songs, we went from straight ahead metal into this slow swing time, but I never changed the click. It kept right on ahead at 140 like the rest of the song, but I was not playing at 140. The cool thing was, every 4 bars lined up on the downbeat, it blew the engineers mind. I just internalized the time, so I could feel the beat even though I wasn't playing on the click. I also don't use accents on a click, they irritate me and make it difficult to float a time signature."

Most drummers will use a rug for that.  Towel or blanket over the snare quiets it down so you don't annoy neighbors or housemates when you practice."
drums,3au7tu,Goodgahdman,2,Tue Jun 23 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the blanket was supposed to act as rug (as my rug sleeps at the bassist's house for two days) but it just slides along and is utterly useless :')  The towel was indeed intended to muffle the snare somewhat, but I can barely notice the difference, so I'll have another look at that ;)"

It's part of the Sabian Big & Ugly line, but I'm not really sure why. The rest of the cymbals are darker and overhammered and/or unlathed. I don't think any of them are really suitable.

drums,3auk2x,panicattackk,2,Tue Jun 23 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"I mentioned it in another post where someone was talking about drum tabs/sheet music and what software other people use.  I use Finale, mostly because its what I've always used and I'm comfortable with it and it gets the job done very well, more and more so as you put more time into it.. It also has some pretty clear and clean playback, obviously with the ability to alter tempo and speed if you wanted to hear it and play along or something. I see a lot of people swear by Sibelius for notation instead but I haven't given it a try yet.  Anyway, one of the main things I actually use Finale for is converting MIDI files into sheet music and creating personal scores for many of the different instruments I play. It literally has this as a feature built in and is really easy to access and use.  Finale does notate drums specifically pretty well (after some practice) in my opinion though I don't have much experience with other notation software, and From my experience it usually translates MIDI to notation pretty well most of the time, though midi files aren't always arranged the same way so perfection can't be promised.  I may be incorrect but I'm fairly certain there is a free version of Finale that does include drum notation but I don't believe the free version includes MIDI notation."

Only other decent one I've seen is:  http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/msg/5072416665.html  But it has a cracked cymbal and currently waiting on pictures of that to confirm it's in good condition.

Eventually you'll want to replace the cymbals (I'm assuming they're all ZXT, which are slightly better than entry level cymbals, but still are not quite intermediate). When you do, search craigslist same as you're doing now and buy pro level cymbals for a fraction of the cost while you establish your technique and preferred sounds.

drums,3aszlq,TehNewDrummer,3,Tue Jun 23 07:07:23 2015 UTC,For a while I tried doing exercises with 2As instead of my normal 5Bs. Didn't like the difference in diameter and when I weighed them side by side the increased weight of the 2As was negligible.  Zildjian has a line of heavyweight sticks that are made of extremely dense wood IIRC so those might be worth a shot in 5B size.
drums,3aszlq,UpholdAnarchy,2,Tue Jun 23 08:38:58 2015 UTC,Mike Mangini signature sticks are heavy like you wouldn't believe. Comparable to 5a/5b in my opinion. A good buddy of mine turned me on to them as practice sticks. You don't have to change your grip with the different diameter like /u/UpholdAnarchy said and you really build the muscles used to control the sticks when you use them.

drums,3aszlq,frozenpizza88,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I used bigger sticks for chop building and endurance exercises. Anything else I'll use my standard kit sticks."
drums,3aszlq,Joshdecent,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:15:46 2015 UTC,I use Ralph Hardimons or MS6's about half the time on pad. The additional weight and size magnifies technique issues and builds wrist/finger muscles a lot faster. BUT it's important to rep stuff on normal size sticks as well.
drums,3aszlq,cubine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:37:49 2015 UTC,For stuff on the pad I like to use heavier sticks. Only because a bigger stick allows me to feel what the stick is actually doing in my hand. But on the kit I use the sticks that I normally use.

It's very difficult to compare the Xist series to XS20's or Alphas, as they create two totally different sounds. The Xists that I've heard have all been slightly dark and trashy sounding, with a lot of raw overtones. XS20s and Alphas, on the other hand, are supposed to be bright, clean, and cutting. Which they are. Sure the Xist cymbals may be less harsh overall, but that doesn't make than other brand's intermediate lines for all applications."

I've played Amedias, Istanbuls, and Bosphorous cymbals, and aside from their different lines within each make, the difference between each make is not much.  There's more a difference between Sabian and Zildjian, and even then they're fairly close."

In general those cymbals where too stiff and britle for me, keyholed any of them but back in the day I was really bad drummer (nowadays I'm just a little better, only a little). I tend to screw them to tight, so that's probably the main reason.  Anyway Turkish cymbals are very popular in my country. Amedias, Istanbuls and Anatolians are everywhere (not so much Bosphorus). For me they used to be almost the same but I think that any company is going to be so creative at crafting cymbals as Meinl so they put new lines into market. Check out Anatolian Mystic cymbals !  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUhsfH8J9A  Anatolians for grooving are just badass. Not so much for heavy, loud music like heavy metal.

Buy rubber tubing, cut it lengthwise, and put it on top  of all of your rims. Cymbals are rough.  If you have the money, the Zildjian Gen 16's are so quiet it's freaky.  They're also freaky expensive.  I would probably just buy those neoprene pad things and put them on your cymbals and try really hard to not accidentally hit metal.   All in all, if you go that route (but without the Gen 16's), that's probably like $500.  The Gen 16's will put you back another few hundred bucks, though."

Also, can you trigger the mesh heads and get the same effect from regular heads? It won't change my mind about the mesh heads but being able to quietly record would be an awesome bonus!"
drums,3aow23,center24tp,3,Mon Jun 22 10:41:54 2015 UTC,"Zildjian markets the Gen 16's as an acoustic/electric cymbal.  From my (limited) experience, they make pretty crappy electric cymbals because they use a tiny microphone to pick up the sound (as opposed to a pickup or trigger) and it is generally unreliable.  They seem to cut out a bit.  As a practice cymbal, they're about the coolest thing ever.  They play like a real cymbal, but they make virtually no sound.  The cymbals are full of small holes that kill the sound as it reverberates.  You can hear them in the same room, but a normal conversational voice will overpower them.    I think Zildjian really missed the boat on marketing those things.  They could also afford to be about $100 cheaper a piece."

Having the actual dimensions and feel of my live drum kit changed everything. There's only a single wall separating my drums from my neighbors, and they haven't heard a thing.  Tips:    Put a pillow in the kick drum. The reso head is louder than you think. Cut the center out of old reso heads, leaving about 3/4"" of plastic around the rim, and keep them on your drums. This drastically cuts down on sound, and saves your bearing edges when you want to play live again. Use a wood or plastic kick drum beater. Soft beaters wear down the mesh a lot faster, and naturally your bass mesh is gonna be the most expensive.   If you already have an electric kit to cannibalize, total cost is around $180, depending on how many drums you have."

What kind of triggers do you use? I know how they work and what they do but I don't know what's good and what Isint because I lack the experience with them."
drums,3aow23,stoph311,2,Mon Jun 22 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"I went the budget route and bought DDrum's Red Shot triggers, which are about $20 per drum. They work great for me, but the triggering might not hold up well for metal or double bass. I've never needed to play incredibly fast on mine, but the toms and snare have no trouble differentiating sixteenth notes. Regardless, they're MUCH much better than the Alesis triggers I was playing on before. Roland makes much nicer triggers of course, but they're $100 apiece (at least at Memphis Drum Shop)."

Eric Harland-Vipassana  Brian Blade- Landmarks  Max Roach- Drums Unlimited  Philly Joe Jones- Showcase  Elvin Jones- A Love Supreme
drums,3an024,BongChong906,3,Sun Jun 21 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, Brian Blade is so good. Everybody should listen to Landmarks, as well as Season of Changes."
drums,3an024,backdooraction,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"Brian Blade's best work, honestly - is on that Kenny Garrett album Pursuance.   Perfection. His playing is a beautiful tribute to Elvin which is often referential but never derivative."
drums,3an024,CheeseFest,32,Mon Jun 22 11:45:08 2015 UTC,Dave Brubeck Quartet - Time Out. Joe Morello is a beast on this record. Highlight Track: Take Five or Blue Rondo a la Turk. Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters. Harvey Mason on drums. Highlight Track: Chameleon. Thelonious Monk - Monk's Dream. Frankie Dunlop on drums. Highlight Track: Monk's Dream. Charles Mingus - Mingus Ah Um. Dannie Richmond. Highlight Track: Better Git It Into Your Soul. John Coltrane - Blue Train. Philly Joe Jones on percussion. Highlight Track: Locomotion or Lazy Bird.   Every single one of these records is basically gospel to a jazz drummer (in my opinion). I've been playing jazz for 17 years now and I still have to stand in awe whenever I happen to hear any of these albums.
drums,3an024,mrespman,6,Sun Jun 21 21:34:47 2015 UTC,Replace Head Hunters with Thrust and I'd completely agree with you.  Mike Clark > Harvey Mason.  Edit: Actual Proof is proof enough in itself.

drums,3an024,crater_fryguy,4,Mon Jun 22 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"eh. I've never felt that Take Five is 'definitive' jazz, or definitive jazz drumming. Morello's good, and the tracks are great, but honestly the album can feel gimmicky, even if it was ahead of its time. I'd swap it for a Miles album or even something pre-bop; or maybe even going in the opposite direction and throw in a Bad Plus album or something from SFJazz. Dave King and Eric Harland are huge in jazz today, and are bringing all sorts of new stuff to the contemporary scene.  Don't get me wrong, I love Time Out, but I just feel like admitting it to the jazz drumming hall of fame is ignoring so many other albums that capture the feel of jazz so much better."

drums,3an024,MusicIsPower,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah to narrow down to just five albums is a difficult task, but not an unproductive one when multiple opinions can be expressed.  It's art.  We will all have different opinions on the same piece. Personally, I wouldn't put Time Out in my top five because of the odd time signatures. It's an amazing album, but something a little more straightforward is a better choice, especially for someone just beginning to explore jazz.  However, I do thing that there's a compelling case to be made because of Take 5's commercial success and popularity. ."

drums,3an024,kungfumastah,8,Tue Jun 23 21:59:31 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of Heavy Weather by Weather Report. I also love School Days by Stanley Clarke (Billy Cobham's work on Life Is Just A Game is what got me into drumming and it still blows my mind 16 years later) but I guess technically both of these fall under fusion jazz?
drums,3an024,JustAWordOnAWall,2,Sun Jun 21 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say fusion for the lack of spang-a-lang swing, but monster albums nonetheless. Alex Acuna is so great on Heavy Weather and Billy Cobham is motherfreaking Billy Cobham."
drums,3an024,TophatMcMonocle,2,Mon Jun 22 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"I met Billy Cobham on his 60th birthday. He was playing a drum clinic in Swansea and my old man took me along. He was absolutely incredible. He can play better with four sticks in his hand than I can with two! Lovely person, too. The whole day was spoilt during the Q&A session by someone wasting a question on asking him how big his feet were for a laugh. There weren't many questions asked after that :( I remember being disappointed because I was trying to ask him to show some of the fills he used on Life Is Just A Game."
drums,3an024,JustAWordOnAWall,2,Mon Jun 22 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"Billy does a great drum clinic. His was one of the first I saw in 1981 or so in Mesa, AZ, and among the most memorable. He was so cool and generous, and his one handed snare drum roll knocked us out. On a humorous note my buddy and I, being huge Mahavishnu Orchestra freaks, were so star struck we couldn't muster the nerve to ask him anything during the Q & A."
drums,3an024,TophatMcMonocle,2,Mon Jun 22 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah man, his one handed roll blew my mind! He so often gets overlooked in a list of ""best"" drummers but he's so damn good.  On the subject of great clinics, I highly recommend JR Robinson's clinics. His was my first clinic back around 2003 and its still the best I've attended to this day."
drums,3an024,JustAWordOnAWall,2,Mon Jun 22 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I saw J.R. Robinson's clinic in a hotel in St. Louis, MO in the 1990s and you're right, that was an amazing clinic. I got to talk to him afterward and asked if he read Modern Drummer magazine, and he said he was too busy hustling gigs to read much of anything. He said that in a way that didn't sound dickish, but rather encouraging toward the idea that maybe it's better to quit thinking so much and get the hell with it.   We all think we can lay down a hard and tight groove, but when you're in a room with J.R. Robinson he bullies the groove, punches it in the throat, and takes its lunch money leaving blood on the ground.   It was a hell of a clinic. I left feeling inept, but with a greater intent toward the groove that's with me to this day."

In hindsight, it kinda was. JR is absolutely a machine haha."

Art was a fantastic drummer with a great feel  Whatever you do don't base your playing on super flashy guys like Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Feel is everything with jazz drumming and those guys had mediocre feel at best compared to some of the greats  Also, anything with Max Roach, Mel Louis, Philly Joe Jones, Jo Jones, or Jimmy Cobb. They're all fantastic"

drums,3an024,TophatMcMonocle,11,Sun Jun 21 22:52:23 2015 UTC,Kind of blue by Miles Davis. Jimmy Cobb plays so simple but so good.

His skip beats on the ride cymbal are played very lightly compared to the quarter notes, and placed a bit closer to the quarter note than the standard triplet feel, while his comping is much more triplet based. That's what gives it that floaty, laid-back feel."

I've probably listened to that album at least 100 times and I feel like I hear something new each time I listen to it, there's just so much there."
drums,3an024,Ben_Man,4,Mon Jun 22 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"Just thought I'd throw in a couple of names as it's easier than 5 albums!  Art Blakey's a great player I haven't seen mentioned yet. I love Billy Ward's 'tour of jazz drummers' video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YexaQsaCrU calling him the Bonham of jazz. Undeniable feel and those buzz rolls are like boilin' buttah!  Seb Rochford is my favourite jazz player. Check out Polar Bear's early albums (self-titled and Held On the Tips of Fingers). His playing with Acoustic Ladyland got me into jazz, that band might be up your street too; after their first album (acoustic Jimi Hendrix covers) they went electric with stuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfui9FHhSM 1st track of the best ""jazz rock fusion"" album ever IMO :D"

Max Roach - A Study In Brown/Clifford Brown and Max Roach - Clifford Brown and Max Roach  Philly Joe Jones - Steamin'/Cookin'/Workin'/Relaxin' with Miles Davis. All of those albums are critical. The TL;DR for these albums is Milestones, but there are no shortcuts in jazz.  Elvin Jones - Coltrane's Sound/Coltrane Plays The Blues/A Love Supreme - John Coltrane  Tony Williams - Vertigo - Jackie McLean/Seven Steps To Heaven - Miles Davis  Roy Haynes - Now He Sings, Now He Sobs - Chick Corea  For big band playing, two really essential albums for me: Philly Joe Jones on Tadd Dameron's the Magic Touch. Harold Jones on Straight Ahead by Count Basie."

Steve Gadd and Steve Smith are considered some of the best modern (jazz?) drummers (albeit their styles have them stray a bit from plain ol ""jazz"").

OH and Art Blakey... listen to a shit ton of Art Blakey. People like Elvin Jones or Tony or Billy Cobham and modern people like Harland or Brian Blade are of course awesome and inspiring but you've probably got a long way to go before you can LEARN much of anything from them."

I can get a great low tone with the 20s, but they end up being too loose. I end up using the 22s for rock/country and the 20s for jazz/blues, so it works out.

Otherwise, duct tape works great!   You may also have a snare set too wide for the snare bed on your shell, which will cause a lot of excess snare buzz. I ran into the same issue recently. I thought that more strands would yield a fatter snare tone, but when I went back to a narrower set, and voila! Problem solved."

drums,3ao2or,Hard_Ball42,13,Mon Jun 22 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"How they were recorded and WHERE they were recorded make the biggest differences. You also had different heads, muffling methods, microphone technology, etc. Even the sound board and preamps they went into are different now.  To be honest, older drums are much worse than new ones, they frequently weren't in round, the hardware was less sturdy and made noise, the heads weren't as uniform, everything has gotten better! But they have one thing that newer drums don't: Old Growth Timber. Very few kits now have this, and old growth timber is more dense than newer fast-growth timber is.  The recordings you really can't replicate anymore. The technology has evolved so far beyond where it was and getting the old tech is too expensive (the Neve consoles that they used are either not sold ever or worth ~10 million). Plus you have 2"" tape and finding someone who knows how to work with it is almost impossible nowadays. All you can do is make new drums sound amazing as they are, use a bit of moongel to give it a slightly deader sound, and you'll be as close as you can get on a budget."
drums,3ao2or,M3lllvar,7,Mon Jun 22 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"You make good points but you totally skip over shell construction and bearing edge, which are really what make the most difference between modern drum shells and old ones.  Thinner (often 3 Ply) shells often constructed with mahogany and more rounded bearing edges offer a warmth and depth that more modern shells usually can not replicate.  Some people love this particular sound, such people would argue that old drums are not worse but superior to modern drums, that is a matter of opinion, however.  I have both a 90s maple starclassic kit as well as a 65' ludwig, both kits wiith same heads sound vastly different even in person.  Both are wonderful in their own right..."
drums,3ao2or,west3rn,2,Mon Jun 22 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"The 3 ply shells were not thinner than modern shells. Mapex Saturn shells, for example, are far thinner than a 60s Ludwig 3 ply. They also used a lot of poplar as a middle ply. The bearing edges were sloppy, and with how people complain about them tody, they would never pass scrutiny."
drums,3ao2or,M3lllvar,2,Mon Jun 22 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"Many vintage 3 ply shells are definitely  thinner than many modern shells.  Not all, but many.  I'm not sure what ""people"" you are talking about outside of your own bias, but I think you are just making whatever that statistic is up, being that it is purely a matter of opinion.   Every good drum shop I have ever been has at least some vintage drums, and they fetch a high price for a reason.  They are also full of modern drums that are also great, but there is a legitimate reason why vintage drums get you a sound and feeling that modern drums will never get you outside of just microphone and recording technique."
drums,3ao2or,west3rn,3,Mon Jun 22 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"No, they aren't. They couldn't work with plies that thin and maintain the integrity of the ply. Most of them are thicker 3 ply shells with re-enforcing rings. The 'people' I am talking about is the number of threads I see crop up monthly across 6 different forums (including reddit) over the last 6 years. I have a pretty good grasp on what people say. In the last 3 years, the 'is my drum out of round' threads and 'check your bearing edges' comments have increased dramatically. At this point, if someone can't tune they assume the drum is out of round or the bearing edge is shot. In the city I live in there is probably the largest collection of vintage drums in one shop that I have ever seen or heard of. They literally have had or have everything. I think I have a pretty good grasp based on having owned several vintage kits and spent a lot of time around vintage and new drums. if you are interested in the shop: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beat-It-Music-Ltd/221477710647?sk=photos_stream&ref=page_internal  As far as 'bias' I didn't post any. I stated that vintage drums are less perfect than new drums. Drum technology has, in fact, gotten better. But the woods they used in vintage drums was better, and they do have that 'vintage' sound. Good or bad is a personal opinion, but the drums had far more imperfections that were considered 'standard' than new drums do."
drums,3ao2or,M3lllvar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"Just to point it out: Slingerland used a 6.35mm formula for a long time. Ludwig and Gretsch were similar in thickness. A brand new Ludwig Classic Maple kit comes with a 7 ply 6mm shell. The vintage shells were not thin. You had a higher wood to glue ratio, but they were not thin. Edit: late night fraction math is not my friend. Vintage shell thickness corrected."
drums,3ao2or,M3lllvar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"You make good points about the thickness of the shells, and you clearly know what you're talking about, but you might be forgetting that people go to forums when they have problems that they need help with. Especially when they can't take a kit back to the garage sale they got it from. There's also the fact that vintage drums can have problems simply because they've been around for decades longer than new ones, and are much more likely to have been abused/neglected/left in a hot car for days/abandoned in a basement that floods.   I know it's anecdotal, but I'm on my 13th(?) vintage Ludwig kit and I've never had one drum go out of round, nor have I recut a single bearing edge. If you inspect before you buy, you shouldn't have problems with a vintage kit."

drums,3aqx43,mykidthinksiamwierd,-4,Tue Jun 23 16:53:00 2015 UTC,Also check out the rest of my covers. It's only a few right now but there are many more coming in the future.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMZqNAyGzANkC6pEyPixow
drums,3ampns,Jacktdrums,3,Sun Jun 21 19:08:44 2015 UTC,Outstanding indeed!
drums,3ampns,MePlayDrums,2,Sun Jun 21 22:29:20 2015 UTC,~ 29:00 - they're locked in so tight it made me kick my dog.  He's my all time favorite.  Legend.
drums,3ampns,adoming6,2,Mon Jun 22 00:24:07 2015 UTC,That dude is a phenomenal bassist. I have no idea who he is though.
drums,3ampns,Irish_McIrishson,2,Thu Jun 25 21:36:38 2015 UTC,"argh!!!  That's Will Lee - bassist for the CBS Orchestra, David Letterman's band with Paul Shaffer!  He's been around for years.  Here's one of my favorites of him with Tommy Igoe and the Buddy Rich Band:  Here"
drums,3ampns,adoming6,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:14:58 2015 UTC,Yeah. I looked it up and was shocked. I've never seen him that young and said holy shit out loud when I saw it was him.
drums,3ampns,Irish_McIrishson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:55:17 2015 UTC,That's one long video. And those hairstyles and mustaches lol
drums,3aoac4,I_Have_Many_Names,2,Mon Jun 22 03:50:16 2015 UTC,"Keller are the standard for a reason. If all you want is standard wood shells (I think they do acrylic too, not sure), it's worth it to just go with Keller.  On the weirder end... I've often debated building a kit out of PVC."
drums,3aoac4,abacacus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:48:52 2015 UTC,Seems like PVC is tough to find in tom sizes.
drums,3aoac4,drummer_god,2,Tue Jun 23 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"Keller is pretty much your only good option. I've priced out entire kits like this, assembling everything myself, and have found that the prices are no better than most of the mid-range full kits on the market right now, unless you do all the drilling and bearing edge work yourself. You then also have to get a good finish. If you have to buy rims too, the price may soon get out of hand. If you want 10/12/15/20, look at the Mapex Mydentity program. You can pick whatever sizes you want and come in under $1000 with a snare. If you are determined to get shells only, make sure you do all the math first. Good luck!"
drums,3ao5l0,_TheInverse_,3,Mon Jun 22 03:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get ravaged for this, but listen to a lot of Metallica. Lars Ulrich is a good template drummer. He plays a lot of simple stuff you can easily put your own twist on. Play his songs, and make it your own. You will develop originality, your own style, and you can experiment with different fills and such. Hope it helps."

drums,3ao5l0,abacacus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"Listen to and play a bunch of Slayer, Testament, and Havok. That should get you in playing shape fairly soon."
drums,3aod02,_Kebert_Xela,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:17:50 2015 UTC,Where did you get this?
drums,3aod02,AndrewUtz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"I traded it from a guy in Hays,KS for a set of new beats that I had."
drums,3amcng,Kindacoolkid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:14:04 2015 UTC,Our performance was also in this cool jazz nightclub called the Moxi Theater.
drums,3amcng,HurbleBurble,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:15:18 2015 UTC,Telecaster for jazz?
drums,3alw9n,MidgetShortage,3,Sun Jun 21 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"Watching now. This is interesting and he's a good player but man, co-fuckin-caine."
drums,3alw9n,Husker-Dude,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:03:42 2015 UTC,Yeah looks like he's beatin a bitch.
drums,3alw9n,LostmyUN,2,Sun Jun 21 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"Sad case. Amazing player - power, groove, the whole package - songs like Diana Ross's ""Upside Down"" & ""I'm Comin' Out."" Such fun.   Jumped out a window in '87."
drums,3amwie,HuubKe161,3,Sun Jun 21 20:08:43 2015 UTC,Practice practice practice. Suck at it until you don't.
drums,3amwie,abacacus,2,Sun Jun 21 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"I would also like to know how to hold my fingers. I play american and I've really been trying to get my fingers working for me. I also had the problem with my stick sliding up to my second joint, all you can really do is play slower and focus on keeping your stick in the first joint. It will feel natural after a while."
drums,3amwie,FatherSplifMas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:17:51 2015 UTC,Well in American grip it doesn't matter if the stick goes up to the second joint. Or do you mean you switched to french grip too?
drums,3amwie,FatherSplifMas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'm still using American, I assumed you had to use your first joint to be able to get finger control."
drums,3amwie,MePlayDrums,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure but I don't think so. For me it seems fine if it goes past the first joint, but what do I know."
drums,3amwie,HurbleBurble,2,Mon Jun 22 12:04:39 2015 UTC,Get JoJo Mayers Secret Weapons DVD and just practice till you're comfortable with it
drums,3amwie,HurbleBurble,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"The first picture is legitimate French grip, the second picture is more of a hybrid timpani grip.  Your fingers are actually correct in the first picture.  A lot of people falsely think that French grip is what you're playing in the second picture."
drums,3amwie,HurbleBurble,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:03:51 2015 UTC,But is the second one wrong?
