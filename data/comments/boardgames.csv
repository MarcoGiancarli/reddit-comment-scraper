boardgames,3e28tk,Emaharg,54,Tue Jul 21 11:57:23 2015 UTC,"I can't believe no one mentioned Tigris and Euphrates. It's a perfect game of tile-laying warfare and point accumulation, with plenty of long-term strategy and turn-by-turn tactical decisions. Every time you play it, there will be a story to tell, about a particularly bold or inconsiderate move, and how you almost dominated the entire board only to see your empire destroyed and your leaders defeated... or how you made an unexpected comeback after being relegated to a tiny little kingdom in the corner of the board.   It's a perfect game."
boardgames,3e28tk,kingofmaybe,7,Tue Jul 21 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"fantastic game. its amazing how it feels abstract in the mechanics, and yet a game feels like a time-lapsed video of Mesopotamian history"
boardgames,3e28tk,zoidberghoneydew,20,Tue Jul 21 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Twilight Imperium.  Nothing else gaming has produced quite has the flair and density of features that a TI game has. At its core it is a game entirely focused on crafting a grand space opera narrative, and providing you the multifaceted tools to do so.  In one of my recent games, my brother was playing the sneaky, patient Yssaril Tribes - a race of genius-level Gollums. Among my three opponents - a race of AI with the best capital ships in the game and a virus that assimilates your technology and has not one but TWO nuclear options - I felt that the Yssaril with their ability to a) skip a turn, thus waiting to see what everyone else does b) steal cards from your hand were STILL the greatest threat to my existence.  So after he had pillaged my hand of cards, I asked him to reconsider his choice of theft. He refused, and so I took one of his outpost systems, destroying it. At the next Galactic Council, he put forth a motion that would do the same to one of my planets. I offered peace terms - he refused and continued to elect my worlds for razing. I finagled the AI race to vote my way (by offering to support her claim for the galactic throne) and we defeated his agenda, but the seeds were sown.  My race was telepaths who can retreat before any battle. My strikes on his spaceports were brutal and swift - slipping through the Wormhole Nexus, knowing that he could not retaliate. I offered another olive branch. He refused.  I blockaded his home systems and wiped every last production facility from the board in an effort to drag him to the negotiation table. He refused, believing that his hand of action cards would save him - in the face of overwhelming military might, his shield was his sympathetic neighbor, and guile his sword.  It's a very big game once you've added the expansions in: 18 races, 500 miniatures, over 1000 cards and a similar number of tokens. But the truth of it, the heart of TI is this:  The rules are only half the game - the systems facilitate player choice. The story above could not have been replicated in any other game I know of - and anyone who's played TI can attest that nothing about that is embellished. That kind of narrative can happen every single game."
boardgames,3e28tk,sigma83,22,Tue Jul 21 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"This is my contender for g.o.a.t. - Add the fact that everyone has something to do each turn (little to no downtime) which is a Godsend in a 5+ player game.   Expansions are great. Theme is amazing. Pieces are FF-standard high quality. Only real negative is game length making it difficult to get a group together, but if you only get to play it once a quarter it's still well worth it and you get bragging rights for 3 months :D   Current Galactic Emperor"
boardgames,3e28tk,xybx,8,Tue Jul 21 15:00:06 2015 UTC,well i want to play it now...
boardgames,3e28tk,imawizardurnot,9,Tue Jul 21 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Been thinking about getting TI3 for awhile now. I was wondering if the expansion are must haves or not? Is one of the expansions more worthwhile than the other?   $200 for TI3+expansions seems steep but it seems like there is a lot enjoyment to be had from it. I figure if I only get one 6 player game out of it, it works out to about $6 per hour per person which is pretty good.  Also how long do you think it'd take to learn assuming I couldn't find someone to teach it to me?"
boardgames,3e28tk,beefarm,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if the expansion are must haves or not?   Nope.   Is one of the expansions more worthwhile than the other?   Ish. Shattered Empire gives more variety in gameplay than Shards of the Throne, but if more of my favorite modules are in Shards.   Also how long do you think it'd take to learn assuming I couldn't find someone to teach it to me?   There are great tutorials  http://www.preeminent.org/steve/games/ti3/ti3demo/3-player/home/index.shtml  and a host of youtube videos. It's not a very complicated game."
boardgames,3e28tk,sigma83,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"You can certainly play the base set, but I would highly recommend getting the Shattered Empire expansion. It rebalances the strategy cards and adds more combat oriented objectives, both of which make the game a lot more dynamic."
boardgames,3e28tk,AncientMinister,20,Tue Jul 21 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"I would just buy the base game and play with the Ancient Throne and Age of Empires variants.  Both are optional rules from FFG. The game is somewhat broken without them, IMO."
boardgames,3e28tk,Aescholus,3,Tue Jul 21 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"what actually happens in this game: You spend 90 minutes setting up the board (unless you use a static setup), then someone gets screwed on the first turn by the planet tokens and gets angry. You wait. Everyone else spends hours building up massive fleets and promising to befriend their neighbors. You wait. You have a large battle and whoever had the most sabotage cards probably wins. You waaaaait. You vote on laws that are either absolutely pointless or game warpingly powerful. You wait. Whoever lost the large battle is probably fucked now so they can either wait wait wait some more or try to play kingmaker. Both are super fun. Also, you fucking wait.  Different strokes for different folks. I have friends that love this game. But I can play half the games on my shelf in the time it takes to play TI3 and have a WAY better time doing it."
boardgames,3e28tk,ISmashCheezits,11,Tue Jul 21 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Waiter! Bring me a game, and be quick about it, I'm a busy man.   I would like something like Agricola, but not fiddly. I don't have any time to waste on set-up, and fifteen rounds? Make it more like four.  And I want something like Le Havre but faster, and it needs to play not just two or three well, but up to six!   And I love auctioning, so something like that too.   Oh, and I thrill to the soft tlac of meeples on cardboard tiles, so it will have to have that.   Also, I'm an international real estate agent for drug cartels, so it needs to be aggressive, I mean, I really want to screw people over--but in a refined way, you understand. So, something like a European take on L.A. gang warfare.  Oh? The number five you say... Keyflower? It sounds like some sort of potpourri. Well, bring it over anyway.   ...  Out of stock!?

boardgames,3e28tk,frogzop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"Caylus - It is the grandaddy of all worker placements and for a reason. Pure worker placement with no frills or gimmicks or secondary mechanics. Spaces activate in a linear order up until a designated end point that players can control / adjust, so order of tiles is critical, in addition, gambling where the end will be is key to a strong turn. Finally, players actually build the available action spaces, determining what becomes available when, and in what order, making each play unique."

boardgames,3e28tk,pvtparts,33,Tue Jul 21 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Its true, there is no hand holding or catch up mechanics. If you want a game with those, look away.  Not much else to say honestly. Haha."
boardgames,3e28tk,bchprty,39,Tue Jul 21 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"Caylus is such a great game.    I took about a 4-5 year break from playing board games after college, and when I came back, a lot of mechanics had been refined and modernized compared to what I had played before my break (to the point that people tell me that the games I played before my break ""feel"" old, and I know what they mean).    Caylus, however, is a game that got it right.  Where so many games combine elements to make something new and exciting, Caylus is the perfect basic worker placement game stripped to its core mechanics.  I'm still amazed at how well it ages and how much replayability it has, considering how little variability there is in the game.  It's almost a perfect information game (you can know all of your opponents possible moves from the moment the board is set up), but all of the elements in the game interact so smoothly that you end up with multiple viable strategies.  It's got a fairly high barrier to entry, but it's totally worth it."
boardgames,3e28tk,forte27,8,Tue Jul 21 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"I love worker placement games (including Russian Railroads, Le Havre, Caverna (Agricola), Stone Age, etc) but ultimately this is the king for me. Everything else has some addition that makes the game unique, but ultimately takes away from the all out battle for action selection. The provost (end point I talked about) adds that extra level of risk/reward and player interaction."
boardgames,3e28tk,bchprty,5,Tue Jul 21 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"I forgot just how brutal and interactive this game was until I played it again a few months ago. Turn 2 I took the Provost space, punishing some of my greedy opponents by pulling the provost backwards so they lost several of their workers. Later on they punished me in return, collaborating to pay money and pull the provost backward so I lost some of my workers.  Then in a really unprecedented play later in the game -- the Provost had been pulled back 2 spaces before my own space, and 3 spaces before another player's space. But I only had $1, and he only had $2, and he had to move first. We arranged a deal where he'd spend $2 to move the provost forward to my space, and I would, out of the goodness of my heart, spend $1 to move the provost forward to his space. It was weird having a ""teammate"" in this kind of brutal euro, but I held to my word. It's just so weird the way the complex kinds of interactions which are caused by the Provost mechanic!"
boardgames,3e28tk,Poobslag,59,Tue Jul 21 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"For those considering this game, this is a wonderful example of how it works. And yes this game is BRUTAL with the provost. Entire turns can be lost by a misjudged provost move (or lackthereof)"
boardgames,3e28tk,bchprty,52,Tue Jul 21 17:50:20 2015 UTC,One of my friends is concerned with luck. How much luck is involved in a game like this.
boardgames,3e28tk,cromiium,12,Tue Jul 21 17:27:09 2015 UTC,"I noticed that your collection is lacking a game of tense competition for survival, with multiple tactics that can be followed to victory. Look no further than Dominant Species. Take your choice of an animal group. Maybe you'd like birds, who are highly effective at migration. Or the arachnids, who excel at eliminating competitors. Perhaps the hardy mammals, who can survive extinction would be your style. And then begin, as the dawn of the Ice Age opens. Over the course of the game, you and your opponents will compete over limited actions, then execute those actions.  Combining excellent action drafting (aka worker placement) with area of control elements, Dominant Species asks you to debate the worth of multiple choices and tracks. Is now the turn where you expand your spread? Or should you contract now? Survive."
boardgames,3e28tk,automator3000,3,Tue Jul 21 13:30:22 2015 UTC,I love this game. Excellent blend of conflict and worker placement.

boardgames,3e28tk,Shotoscottch,4,Tue Jul 21 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"The Card Game is an adaptation of the game - you're still playing as different animal groups, competing for dominance, but in a condensed format.  The Card Game is primarily a hand management game: do you use this card now, or will it be better used next round?, while the board game is primarily worker placement: do you take this action, or will someone else use it, or is there another action that I need/want more? with a strong seasoning of area of control.  Depends on what you like more. Hand management isn't my choice mechanic - all the games I like the most are worker placement, so the choice is easy for me. But the card game is cheaper, faster, and has the same theme."
boardgames,3e28tk,automator3000,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:29 2015 UTC,Thank you! This helps out a lot.
boardgames,3e28tk,Shotoscottch,5,Tue Jul 21 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Rounding out my top X...  Yinsh sounds simple enough, place disks, flip disks, get three in a row, then you realize that row you've been building for yourself is just as tempting for your opponent. Then you figure out how to block, how to control territory, and a host of other strategy ideas blossom in your head.   Carcassonne is for me the perfect gateway. It is easy to teach (leave out farms for the first game), it can be a leisurely semi-coop where you make a pretty map, or a vicious knife fight over farms. Its visually pretty, and this is the game that gave us meeples, the symbol of our hobby  I've played perhaps 8 games of Power Grid, and three of them have come down to the last turn, two of them have gone to money as a tie breaker, one had the winner winning by $2, and one by $1. The game is like a Swiss watch, finely tuned to create outcomes like this"
boardgames,3e28tk,zoidberghoneydew,28,Tue Jul 21 13:21:01 2015 UTC,"I really REALLY want to like YINSH. The main thing preventing that is that the lookahead is so unintuitive to me, and so much can change in one move, that it overall creates an unsatisfying experience for me. The fact that the game starts off kinda slow and only slowly ramps is an additional factor. Maybe I'm just really bad at YINSH, but at the same time I'm not itching to get any better, if that makes.  Now with TZAAR on the other hand, even though I'm terrible the game is really intriguing to me. Tension is almost immediate, and both the frequent tactical and strategic considerations titillate my mind like no other.  I almost want to try a variant of YINSH where a group of markers are seeded in the middle at the beginning of every game. Failing that, I will probably trade the game away."
boardgames,3e28tk,pvtparts,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"My YINSH strategies:  Control the center - keep some rings in the center and use them later  Block opponent rings - it limits how many pieces they can move. Be sure to box them out from the center or wherever they're trying to go, it limits their range and they have to move a ring twice to get around you, losing tempo.  Don't build four in a row - some people meticulously build a 4-string of their color and work for the 5th piece at the ends. This usually takes a while and it's very obvious to your opponent. It's easy to defeat, and god forbid they take advantage and flip the whole thing for a point.  Instead of building strings, it's more efficient and cunning to flip existing strings to your advantage.  People that don't know what to do on their turn generally try to flip the most colors into their own. That's fine, but I prefer to move a ring into the center or box an opponent's ring out. The board builds over time and I wait in the middle to jump out and flip a string into a 5-set.  [Edited for clarity]"
boardgames,3e28tk,POOPSHOOZ,25,Tue Jul 21 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the old adage in American Football: don't make mistakes and wait for your opponent to beat himself.  I've tried to control the center, but I also have done well by building on the edge: if one end of your row is at the edge, your opponent can't flip the entire row"
boardgames,3e28tk,zoidberghoneydew,10,Tue Jul 21 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"For me YINSH openings feel very random, I feel like I can play anywhere and it won't make a difference to the end game.   When I play I usually try to think about things like ""how many places can I move this disk"" and ""how many rows am I controlling"", instead of how many rows I have. Not that I'm good at it :)"
boardgames,3e28tk,zoidberghoneydew,5,Tue Jul 21 14:31:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the openings do feel very random and inconsequential (they almost certainly are not, but how they feel is really what's important to someone, especially beginners).  To me, this is an unwanted feelings in a short abstract game."
boardgames,3e28tk,pvtparts,20,Tue Jul 21 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"I've tried one game where I put all my disks on one edge: I think 3 disks on the 2nd row, and 2 disks in front of those. The 3 disks on the 2nd row worked on building up a row, and the 2 disks in front were blockers. I think I won"

Cyclades:    Supports 2-5 players Awesome Ancient Greece theme Fighting with cool soldier figurines and ships Extremely simple victory conditions. (If you have two metropolises, you win) The defender doesn't win. If it's a tie, both attacker and defender lose a soldier Power Grid-esque bidding phase forces you to alter your strategy constantly and think on your feet I can't emphasize how many times I tell new players: THERE IS NO BAD FIRST MOVE. In fact, almost anything you do in this game gets you closer to victory. This also means that almost every game of Cyclades that you play is really, really close. Hades expansion adds tons of new features if you start to find the base game is getting stale.  Doesn't require you be aggressive to win the game. In fact, often the most aggressive player becomes targeted by everybody else and loses quickly.   Kemet   Supports 2-5 players Awesome Ancient Egypt theme Fighting with cool soldier figurines Simple victory conditions (first to X points wins) Variable game length - change number of victory points required to win for longer/shorter games. Basically always balanced Zero dice rolls All combat is based on number of soldiers and some intuition about the strategy of the other player. It's always your fault, not the dice's. Instead of bidding, there is an upgrade/technology tree that means that your strategy can alter significantly when the upgrade you wanted is taken by another player. Encourages aggression - winning on offense scores you points. winning on defense does not.   These games are everything you wanted Risk to be."
boardgames,3e28tk,Rkeus,34,Tue Jul 21 15:47:24 2015 UTC,Upvote for Kemet. I love how this game doesn't allow for turtling and forces players to be be strategically and tactically aggressive. Kemet is my only 10.
boardgames,3e28tk,Wisecow,4,Tue Jul 21 16:57:08 2015 UTC,I totally agree. It makes me feel like all of my friends are actually having a good time because none of them are just sitting there doing nothing and winning passively.
boardgames,3e28tk,Rkeus,25,Tue Jul 21 17:00:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. It also helps to curb the feeling of ""downtime"". With a 5 player game you might have to wait a few minutes for it to be your turn next, but since something is always happening that will likely impact you directly or indirectly, leaving or closing an opening for your next move, it keeps it engaging to watch what your friends are doing."

boardgames,3e28tk,soupness,5,Tue Jul 21 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of self copypasta but... outside of Chess Twilight Struggle is my favorite board game.    TS is a bit like playing Wario in Mario Kart...  It's nigh impossible to do well when just starting to play and you're going to take some blindsides then fly off quite a few cliffs but once you've got a dozen games under your belt you'll find that such top speed is rarely matched in the gaming world.  At its hard heart TS is a test of will and crisis management. The real 'taste' of it doesn't hit you until you smile when being dealt a hand of your opponents events. Before that you're just working out how to get the meat to your mouth.  Often it's better to trigger the other sides painful event when they're in your hand [eg - Suez was only able to remove 3 influence because US had 0 in France? Take that, Commie! / Panama Canal got popped only to have its 1 inf couped right out of Venzuela. Suck it, Carter!]. There's a cricket bat on the table that will be used against your person... but by bashing your own face in you're often able to soften the blow a fraction or two.  Twilight Struggle's mechanics nail the tension and brinksmanship of the Cold War. Area control, historical card effects and Ops for Event tradeoffs are perfectly dovetailed to the theme of the long twilight struggle, nearly crafting an alternate reality each time the Headline Phase for T1 rolls around - realities that are as exciting as they are educational... it's always a joy to talk about Allende and the Red Scare with newcomers while detailing their ingame uses.  The tension, the hope in a new hand after a barely survived turn in which your opponent thought he was the one in trouble, the plans within plans within plans nature of headlines, the narrowing of eyes when seemingly wasted Ops go into hence unscored regions, the historical weight of the cards, the infinite variations of their use, the fact that you'll never see the same board twice, the depth of character TS reveals about your opponent and how they deal with adversity, the... everything.  Gods I love this game. :D  Simple mechanics, infinitely complex strategy and endless replayability. You'll never see the same game twice... Commie Blitzes will end the game decisively on Turn 3, AR7 Capitalist Charges will save the day in Final Scoring and DEFCON suicides will end the game abruptly on Turn 6.  TS is a fabulous game. You get to learn a lot about how the gears of someone's mind turn when you sit across the Cold War table from them as they scramble to mitigate the damage from a hand full of 'your' cards or navigate that crucial T2 hold.  Browse around this site for some wonderfully succinct card breakdowns and expanded analysis. Skim through the card list, read through the short rulebook and then have at it! Bonus: you'll be exposed to a ton of Cold War history if you haven't been through it already.  The beats of TS are exceedingly simple - play a card, resolve, next round... repeat. The steps of a turn are laid out on the board in concise fashion.  But the strategy is a wondrous rabbit hole... you'll have a grand, mystifying, upsetting, joyous spelunk in search of a bottom you know just isn't there."
boardgames,3e28tk,southern_boy,6,Tue Jul 21 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"I am not good at Twilight Struggle, but I have never seen a War Theme be implemented to well and so accurately in a game before. The tension you hear about in Cold War is depicted PERFECTLY in this game."
boardgames,3e28tk,bchprty,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think the trick with twilight struggle is to just go for it your first few times. If you try to be perfect on your first few playthroughs you're going to miss out on the actual fun of the game.  Half the fun is that things initially have unexpected consequences. And like the real cold war, each decision has countless outcomes. So many so that it's impossible to plan too far ahead."

boardgames,3e28tk,desertsail912,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:57 2015 UTC,"Well, you seem to know a thing or two about the game.. So I have a noob question (I have the game, but have only played like 3 or 4 times)..   How do you not let on what place you´re going to score on the round? Whenever I start amassing influence, coups, etc, wherever, my opponent already knows where the scoring is going to happen..  I figure there must be ways to bluff, double bluff, but at some point (and fast) you will need to increase your presence there before the scoring...  Thx :)"
boardgames,3e28tk,BlindMildred,16,Tue Jul 21 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Good question!    In general:    Access is the most important factor in TS, insofar as I've seen.  That's why the Iran coup is so important, why Ussuri can be so deadly and why 'teleport' cards like DeCol/DeStal are such a determining factor in who wins the Cold War.    If you're amassing influence, couping, etc you're solidifying your regional position and typically expanding your access... should your opponent react by throwing his entire turn toward slowing your advance then rejoice - for he is reacting to you and you're well on your way to victory.  :)    The best way to ""bluff"" your opponent is to give him multiple concerns every AR.    In specific:    As the US, advance into Malaysia and set yourself up for Europe domination in the same AR.  The Reds will have to be concerned that you have Europe scoring and react to possibly losing Thailand next round.  If you do have Europe scoring pop it and enjoy your 5 points.  If you don't then no worries, you've gained Asia ground and shored up Europe as well.    As the USSR, after covering your coup debt use whatever 'teleport' cards you have to leap all over the board - this is especially nasty midwar with card help.  Let's take Africa as an example.  The dark continent is yours... those 1 stability nations are wonderful coup targets and forcing the US to pop a Brush War on Nigeria is glorious.  Again, if you have Africa scoring that's awesome but fixing the USA eye on one region will allow you to nibble gains in several.  Another powerful USSR way of doing this is Middle East Control with no US presence... typically only achievable in games where you've Suez'd or Arab/Israeli'd on the T1 Headline or been fortunate with Muslim Revolutions later.  Bonus, OPEC now becomes a deadly card for the US as it's at least 6vp!    ""Bluffing"" also depends on where you are at in the game...    Early War is often the most 'known' portion of the game - three scoring cards, certain knowledge of most of your opponents' hand after the T3 reshuffle, only one deck, etc...    So there's not a lot of hope in fooling your opponent into thinking you don't have Asia Scoring when he knows it is in your hand.  :)    The more you play the better sense you'll have of the ebb and flow of the game... T1 is pretty much a race to Thailand, T2 and 3 is the France dance, T4-6 is China Card management and 'Big 3' fight and T7-10 is Wargames push/pull, the race to 20 or FS positioning.    If all that reads like so much gibberish don't worry - it'll come naturally soon enough.    If you want to keep your opponent guessing give him multiple concerns as often as you can.  But never forget some hands will be bad and the only way to play them well is to survive the round.  Never forget that some games will be stacked against you - you roll 1s for all your coups and 6s for all your Spaces, no Big 3 cards come your way and your opponent popped Decol AND DeStal on T1...  that happens.  No worries.  Never let 'em see you sweat.    Remember that as long as the game isn't at 20, Defcon isn't 1 and T10 isn't over there is always a chance, especially if your opponent is brazen about degrading Defcon or doesn't think about card interactions overmuch.  I've been at -19 and won because a Ruskie Missle envied me after I degraded Defcon on the headline and I was able to hand him We Will Bury You.  Phew!    That's a lot of words to say if you want to ""bluff"" folks into not knowing where you'll be scoring always do the right play.  Always be expanding your access... and as frequently as you can order your action rounds to mitigate your opponents' card damage - eg play the China Card then Cultural Revolution/Nixon Plays, etc.    As long as you don't panic, remember that a handful of your opponents' cards means good things for you later AND that you get to dictate how they pop and learn from your mistakes you'll be as good a TS player as there is.    Because it's like the old line - if you meet a TS player who makes no mistakes it's because you're meeting a TS player who has made them all already.    Every 'how did I not see that coming?' loss is like an arrow shot into your person... but an arrow that is then pulled out and placed in your quiver for future use... and you'll never be so easily hit by its like in future.    Just like Chess my best advice to get better at misdirection, and everything else in the game, is to play play play.  Eventually your gametime will be under an hour, you'll be able to order your hand in seconds with just a quick glance at it and the board state and your gut will be near psychic as to what the fella sitting across the table has in his hand.    Keep playing - and spread the TS love... the more folks we get into this grand game the better.  :D"

boardgames,3e28tk,BlindMildred,37,Tue Jul 21 18:24:29 2015 UTC,"no, i don't think i can because Power Grid has the most boring premise and mechanics that seem overly complex (they are not) and you have to play it (and lose a couple of times) to enjoy it."
boardgames,3e28tk,dvallej,9,Tue Jul 21 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"My favorite as well.  The ""punish the leader"" catch up mechanic is fantastic.  The simple supply/demand resource pool is wonderful.  The need to make your money stretch across 3 critical decisions - mentally challenging.  You will feel that rush of adrenaline as the game ends and you can finally breathe - after holding your breath and sitting on the edge of your seat for 3 hours!!!"
boardgames,3e28tk,DramFan,17,Tue Jul 21 15:26:01 2015 UTC,"People always write off Power Grid for having a boring premise, but I think that does it a disservice. You are a king own a power company and you're trying to expand your kingdom network, edge your opponents out of unclaimed territory and strategically buy soldiers resources to earn as much gold money as possible. Combine that with hands down my favorite catch up mechanic I've ever played with and it's clear to me why this is such a great game."
boardgames,3e28tk,tenderbranson301,7,Tue Jul 21 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"it does have a great catch up mechanic, to the point that you can use it to your advantage most of the time"
boardgames,3e28tk,dvallej,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've certainly won games when I'm out in first the entire time. But, my favorite strategy is to sit back in last place and wait for Stage 2 to hit and then race to the finish as fast as possible. Couple this with my ability to do quick math and ruthlessness in cornering opposing players and it's also one of my favorite games."
boardgames,3e28tk,Captain-Douche-Canoe,7,Tue Jul 21 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, ""first place"" is very, very rarely the player in first.   So it's about being able to examine the current state of the board, resource and power plant market, as well as your opponents holdings and figure out when to make your worst-to-first slingshot move.  I think that's what OP meant when he said ""you need to play it a couple times to get it"", because if the people you're playing with allow you to abuse the catch up mechanic, your group hasn't played enough to grasp the deeper strategy."
boardgames,3e28tk,boom_shoes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"in my opinion the game is about pace, some people have won being in first place the whole time and people actively trying to not let her win and sometime people win by just being in last place until they decide to end the game and win."

I liked the jacket, but losing the remote entry and having to get my car rekeyed sucked.  So what games do you already have in your collection and what are you playing?

While your week sounds liked it sucked a lot more than mine, we play always once a week often more. But that one night, dedicated to games is the night when a few mates come over. We debrief the week and that's it, no more work talk then hit the games. We have noticed that we totally forget about work, the stress, private stress... Everything. We focus on playing. It is a huge escape for us and we miss it when we can't play that one night a week.  We would play more but we are 40 something professionals. Managers in health and therefore very busy. We have demanding family schedules and we are not 18 anymore. But for that one night a week we can imagine we are 18 again and not a care...

Board games, like other forms of entertainment, is always a welcome distraction from our struggles. But it also helps us get connected to the people we love, and it gets us off of our phones and computers, thus helping us slow down a little bit.

boardgames,3e2d7t,breaking3po,9,Tue Jul 21 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"Well it does say in the rulebook to focus on your economy while not growing your population too quickly. But to completely ignore them is not a good strategy, imo. You'll cap out your econ really easily, and you'll need to hit those red gates to lower you econ, so you can cap it again. Otherwise, you'll be wasting time and money. I would say I spend A on econ, B on econ and rep/pop, and C on rep/pop. But it's also entirely dependent on your goals."
boardgames,3e2d7t,BlueSapphyre,5,Tue Jul 21 12:45:24 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but a lot of the C tiles depend to varying degrees on already having a sort of framework built up. If you're getting reputation for any green tiles (I think one of the schools is like this?), but you haven't built any yet, that potentially powerful tile is now trash."
boardgames,3e2d7t,IcariteMinor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, but you have no idea whether that tile is actually coming so you can't over the course of the game strategically start taking green tiles. You can happen to have some, sure...  I feel like the entire game is when to pull the trigger on starting to collect reputation. Which means, until then, econ is the way to go, solely. Mind you, I've only played a handful of times."
boardgames,3e2d7t,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"Once you know what tiles are possible, you can plan your strategy around the possibility of that tile coming out, and have some contingency plan if it never comes out. Like the Recycling Plant is insanely strong during C if you've planned out your city to have 3-4 industrial tiles that you can drop it adjacent to, 7-9 reputation is pretty good. But your industrial should already be good, so that if you don't get it, you didn't screw yourself. Like grabbing airports, slaughterhouse/farm if there's a lot of restaurants, etc."
boardgames,3e2d7t,BeriAlpha,5,Tue Jul 21 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty common overall strategy for almost every game involving points and a gameplay engine; building your engine quickly, but knowing when to switch to grabbing points quickly."
boardgames,3e2d7t,TheGameGuru,6,Tue Jul 21 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"I played a game over the weekend where my friend never went above 4 income and destroyed us. He had zero income for the first few turns, but made a ton of money through the county assessor office, waterfront realty and the bay (in one turn he brought in $32 million with an investment marker). He was in first on the population track the whole time, and ended the game with -5 income. Finished ~20 population ahead of the second place player. Obviously you have to get money one way or another, but focusing purely on income is not the only way to fill the coffers."
boardgames,3e2d7t,EpicureanHorn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"In my search to see what County Assessor did, I found 3 reviews of Suburbia Inc. mentioning it as their new favorite tile and one BGG thread asking if it was overpowered.  The next thing I'd ask is: are there enough outlying tiles, such as county assessor, to change the econ strategy,  (and does that even matter knowing that any of them might not even show up in the game?)"
boardgames,3e2d7t,Vanbone,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:20 2015 UTC,Homeowner's Associations can support a powerful strategy. Waterfront Realty will increase money from lakes and Mints gain you money for civic buildings
boardgames,3e2d7t,CelticVengeance,3,Tue Jul 21 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"I suppose this limits the game, but I don't think the game is very limited. The strategy and tension of the game really revolve around HOW you do this, and there are plenty of options. And depending on the goals, available tiles, and your opponents strategies, your best strategy can vary widely. Some tiles, like Casino, can even allow you to break free of the income to points pattern of play.   The last game I played, I ignored my income for the early game, bought tons of cheap green and laked for quick cash, boomed my economy in a few big bursts early/mid-game, then totally ignored my economy and reputation in favor of big one-time point grabs throughout the mid/late game. The last three rounds I had virtually no income and negative reputation. I'd ignored every goal but my personal one. And I still won (though by a small margin).   Not only did I feel this was a very different strategy than either of my opponents played, but it was a very different strategy than I'd ever played. It left me feeling that Suburbia really did offer pretty diverse paths to victory."

I'd swap them with Traumfabrik (aka Dream Factory aka Hollywood Blockbuster) and LotR: The Confrontation... and I don't know which else I'd knock off between the ones I didn't care for, but Botswana (aka Loco! aka Thor aka Wildlife Safari) is one of the greatest, most underrated fillers of all time."

boardgames,3e214v,LOLBastardSword,3,Tue Jul 21 11:13:31 2015 UTC,"Pathfinder: Adventure Card Game is a solid choice, while some would argue that it isn't technically a deck builder, you do get cards that you than get to add to your deck so that counts in my book. You have progression on two fronts gaining new cards (equipment, armor, spells, blessings, allies, and items) and you have progression with the actual hero itself with bonuses to rolls, the ability to put more cards of certain types into your deck (which is essentially your life, it runs out you die) You can also get prestige classes which add even more flair to your character.  There are 3 stand alone games in the series each game has six adventure packs each adventure pack contains 5 quests/scenarios. The first two games (Rise of the Runelords and Skulls and Shackles) are complete, while the 3rd one Wrath of the Righteous just started it's cycle and is nearing the release of it's 2nd adventure pack I think. I should mention that if you want to play the campaign game you are looking at it taking about 40+ hours to complete."

Don't let the admittedly terrible art throw you off."
boardgames,3e214v,Comassion,0,Tue Jul 21 11:37:27 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome!  I'm totally giving it a shot.
boardgames,3e1khx,doctormaxvonsydow,29,Tue Jul 21 06:33:51 2015 UTC,"The best general advice I can give: it is of tantamount importance to know the cards in your deck.  You have a known, finite amount of attack/move/influence/whatever-you-need that you will be able to generate each round.  If you have already played your big attack combo, don't be expecting a great combat hand later on.  If you have not seen a single one of your influence cards yet, try to plan to get to a location to utilize them since you know they will be in-hand soon.  If most of your move cards have been played, don't be expecting to cross that desert in the day.   You never want to just putter along, but sometimes you need a turn or two to prepare for taking a location with a huge payout (the amount of time you can afford to wait is largely dependent on the other-players/dummy-player so pay attention to their pace.)  Try to minimize the amount of cards you play sideways, using them only to push you over the edge for actions with worthwhile rewards.    Think less in terms of what your hand can accomplish on a specific turn, and more in terms of what your deck is going to accomplish over the course of a round.  Always be mindful of what is in your discard and draw stacks so that you may act accordingly.  Some slightly more specifc but still somewhat general tips I can think of:    Artifacts are great.  Strong effects that require no mana?  Sign me up. Crystals are great.  No mana is no fun.  Always be looking for ways to get a few extra crystals in your bag, whether it be stopping at a mine on your way to somewhere else, or Crystalizing from the Source while you set up your hand for a big move next turn. Spells are great, but don't get too many.  They are strong but require lots of mana.  Having one or two strong spells in hand is great.  Having over half your hand be spells is not (except for some extreme circumstances.) Units are great.  When I first got Mage Knight I also had that weird idea in my head that units were 'one-use' and, while not bad, they were disappointing.  Then I realized pretty much every card you have is a 'one-use' card.  Doh.  Even after you use the abilities on a unit you can still assign damage to them.  They are basically the only type of card that isn't 'one-use', in that sense.  They are available whenever you need them, so its like being able to draw one over your handsize and know before-hand exactly what card you are going to get. Often it is worth it to simply replace a wounded unit with a stronger one rather than try to heal them.  Especially true if the unit has already been spent this round (since the new recruit will come in unspent.) Try to balance your deck.  That Song of Wind may be tempting, but if you already have Pathfinding, Wings of Wind, Frost Bridge, and Underground Travel then you really don't need it. Likewise, if you already have lots of strong attack cards, get some movement ones.  That's super terrific that you have become Destroyer of Worlds, Master of Hellfire, and Lord of Destruction... but if you are stuck in the middle of a swamp then no one really cares.  Except maybe a Yoda. Elemental attacks are almost always necessary to beat the tough, late-game enemies.  Try to pick some up, or acquire some other ways to deal with them (e.g. Expose.) Taking a few wounds is a normal part of the game and is often required to get some of the better rewards early on, so don't make weak plays trying to completely avoid them.  Ideally, you will be able to heal right after, but it is okay to rest and deal with them on a later round.  Just be conscious that the wounds are in your deck and will need to be dealt with via Tranquility/Magic Glades/Monastaries/etc.; you should come out of the whole mess much stronger. Likewise, do not take lots of wounds for little gain.  It's super great that you killed that Orc Summoner and I'm sure the villagers are all very happy about it and are slightly less perturbed that you ransacked their monastery and reduced it to a pile of charred stone and cinders, but it probably was not worth getting butchered by a Minotaur for.  Especially since that Monastery that could have patched you up is slightly less functional than it once was. Get cards and skills that complement each other.  If you already have Mana Storm, Emerald Ring, and Gem Pouch, you should probably avoid the Crystal Crafts in favor of something you do not have.   The most important card in your starting deck is Concentration (or Will Focus.)  Being able to pair this up with Swiftness for Ranged attack 5 is one of the strongest early combos and can deal with most unfortified enemies by itself.  There are lots and lots of other good uses for this card too, so keep it in mind and try to get the most out of it. Say ""Bwaaaaaah"" Inception-style whenever you kill an enemy with just the Horn of Wrath."
boardgames,3e1khx,Tsorne,4,Tue Jul 21 10:47:37 2015 UTC,"I would add that Monasteries are still great to loot for artifacts :) Don't be afraid to sack a few during play. Reputation is easily restored killing wandering orcs and dragons.  When it comes to character skills I generally prefer the ones that give constant bonuses (+2 to attack, etc) instead of the one-use-per-round ones that sometimes you never quite find the right moment to use. Extra attack, defence and movement are always really handy.  And don't forget movement cards :( A balanced deck, as Tsorne says, is necessary, and in particular some key movement cards can drastically change how much fun you're having. One of the worst aspects of the game is ending up feeling stuck in a corner of the map, having to spend good attack cards sideways just to move a space or two."

boardgames,3e1khx,breaking3po,6,Tue Jul 21 11:49:46 2015 UTC,"Can't exactly highlight enough the importance of Concentration.  If you are playing this card sideways, or using it for the token, and not defeating a juicy enemy, you are doing it wrong."

Units are great.     Units are particularly great for taking wounds. Need to beat a strong dragon but don't want to get knocked out. Throw some wounds on a unit. You don't have to heal units (though you might want to if you have a particularly good one), you can just replace them after!      but if you are stuck in the middle of a swamp then no one really cares. Except maybe a Yoda.      Always plan your moves several turns ahead. Don't cut through a forest at the end of the day if you eventually need to backtrack, that Mage Tower isn't worth getting stuck for the entire round. Same goes for desert tiles. If you're in a situation where you're chasing Volkare (for example) the last thing you want to do is get stuck in bad terrain. You can burn through your deck so fast trying to get out.      Taking a few wounds is a normal part of the game and is often required to get some of the better rewards early on, so don't make weak plays trying to completely avoid them.      When I first started playing, this was a huge concept that took me a while to adopt. I'd start the game so cautious, that by the end I was useless. If you can beat an orc and level up on your first turn at the expense of taking a wound or two, you should absolutely do it. A few wounds are easy to get rid of over the course of a round.      And I'll add one more thing.   Take advantage of Adventure Sites. Might not be the most exciting thing, but you can re-enter Dungeons and Ancient Ruins. You won't get the same reward as the first time, but if there's nothing else nearby camping there and fighting brown tokens to level up can be very beneficial."
boardgames,3e1khx,ramstoria,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"Units, units, units! They're like cards, except you can use them anytime and they don't clog up your hand. Elites are awesome, but often enough regulars are pretty damn fine as well. Throw in the ability to unspend units (herbalists, Norowas) and you can get some great mileage from units. If you get your hands on the right artifacts, that can help too (even a peasant can be useful with Banner of Fear!). You can even assign damage to them, 4-5 armour on a minion of yours can really take the edge off of an enemy attack. And don't forget, damage resistant units can take double their armour in the appropriate damage type (ex: golem eats 6 physical to the face).  Spells are pretty great too, though with them you're at the mercy of getting them at the right time.  Do you get any movement cards on level-ups or otherwise? Do you play cards sideways a lot? I found that getting more movement helped me get more efficiency out of my other cards as I was able to move with less.  But really, it sounds like you underplay units."
boardgames,3e1khx,tiny_markatas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:01 2015 UTC,"But isn't it rare that you can unspent a unit and, even then, that you'll have more than 2-3 in a game? The fact that they're one use throws me off!"
boardgames,3e1khx,tiny_markatas,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:12:12 2015 UTC,"It's a crazy powerful ability, and thus it is indeed rare. You don't need it, but if you get it it can be well worth it.  And I used to be put off by them being one-off too, but think about it. Your Concentrate is once-per-turn. Your rage is once-per-turn (you just have two copies). And so is your Amotep Freezer or whatever. And like Rage, you can have multiple copies of those. They're exactly like cards in your deck, except you don't have to get lucky to draw them at the right time and they don't clog up your hand ever.  As for unit numbers, I find it varies. Sometimes I indeed only get about 3 by endgame, but a few times I've gone up to five. It really depends where I am and what's on offer when I get influence heavy hands."

boardgames,3dzeya,dbl_dbl,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on the competitive side, you need to buy multiples of a lot of ships, not for the ships, but for the cards included in them. Like the upcoming $99 Raider comes with a card that ""fixes"" a problem with the TIE Advanced (the TIE/x1 title).  Like let's say you want to fly Deci-Whisper (Decimator+TIE Phantom). You'll also want to pick up the Lambda for crew Vader and Rebel Captive, AW or Aces for Push the Limit, TIE Defender for Predator.

X-Wing did not give you the first wave of ships' cards and a proxy token in the core box. Right now, the tiny-box/figure-only Imperial Assault expansions are primarily a Skirmish affair that campaign players can safely ignore if they can manage to survive with cardboard tokens.  I'm guessing small-box and big-boxes will be more general purpose and benefit campaigns more (and always come with proxy tokens and cards for each figure in the corresponding wave). These expansions, like Twin Shadows, are the only ones I'm going to be actively purchasing. Figure packs are a very rare here-and-there if I like the character enough."

It's anything but an afterthought; in fact, I'd say it's one of the best two-player games I own. It's very competitive rather than story-based. You can pick a map, build your own little Rebel or Imperial army, and then battle to the death. I actually like playing a skirmish more than the campaign sometimes.

He only uses one type of brush (size 1) and a handful of paints.  Then I know someone who does undercoat, base colours, shade, highlight 1, highlight 2, highlight 3 etc. That takes more time, more different types of brushes and more paint.

Paints will run 3 dollars a bottle for Vallejo, and Reaper MSP paints. and a good starter brush set will run 10-15 paints. you will see people only using one size brush but they have a LOT of practice. so I recommend getting a size 2 or 3 curved brush for dry brushing, a size 1 brush, and a size 3/0 brush for the tiny details.  as far as time... when i just started out it would take 3 hours or so to do a model this size because I was trying to do it right and was slow at it. I have gotten that down to about an hour per model.  Just get in there and practice."

However, $60 is a great deal, and if you paid shipping on MM's sale price, it would have been about $60, too."

boardgames,3e1vj1,Grunherz,3,Tue Jul 21 11:30:38 2015 UTC,"If you're planning on doing a Math trade, you'll need to wait until an applicable one (usually they are US/Europe specific shipping or local/con No-ship designated) comes up for you to join (you can find when new Trades go up at the Trade Forum or login to the OLWLG [where a majority of math trades happen] and browse the active trades list). From there, you can join it and use whatever system they use to participate.  If you're just looking to do regular trading on BGG, there's a tab on the top bar called ""Bazaar"" which will help you find trades to make by clicking the Trades open on the dropdown. You can either do ""Direct Match"" which will just find every trade in the system based on all of your wants/offers vs everybody else's wants/offers, or do a custom search to find specifically if anybody wants your game for theirs. If you find a trade through the Trade Search system, people usually prefer if you send a message to them laying out the proposed trade first rather than just sending a trade request."

Merlin signaled (I believe using the voting stones)  who was good and who was bad within the first minute of the game.  We don't play with Merlin anymore.  I realize the counter argument, "" OH, you just got outplayed, so you're salty.""  In my opinion there was no game left to play.  Percival could reveal they were percival and manipulate the rest of the game and Merlin never said a word the rest of the game.  The game ended with 3 straight victories for Good.

It doesn't have to be dramatic at all.  That said I think getting someone to pick up a phone and then playing the phones make you lose card in a goofy game like that is exactly the design intent of the card. The other player's reaction  should tell you everything you need to know. Did he laugh? Or did he say, ""You're a dickhead, Todd""? (Your name is Todd.)

In a game like BSG the moves you describe are totally fine (I'm not sure how the phone thing applies but getting people to gang up on someone or forming alliances and then breaking them).   I think in the end it would be good to ask something like ""hey guys, I realize I may be a little more competitive then most while playing.

Like I said I really think it depends on the group, and game, and expectations."
boardgames,3e21vz,Mahuloq,0,Tue Jul 21 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"See I'm real torn about this.  I think if someone is talking shit and doing this stuff and making fun of people then that's crossing the line and that person is terrible.    On the other hand, this is a game, and if you are an experienced player and you lost by a clever, unexpected and unseen tactic then don't hate the player, hate the game.  If this makes it so you aren't having fun anymore then you've forgotten that this is a game."
boardgames,3e21vz,DnMarshall,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"clever, unexpected and unseen tactic then don't hate the player, hate the game.   If that tactic involves reaching outside of the game though, then it's on the player. You used to get questions in Netrunner about whether or not it's OK to pretend to install an agenda as ICE but take it back before you do, to make your opponent think that the 1 card in your hand isn't an agenda. IMO that's pretty shitty. In your Playtest thing, it seems like the point of that card is to catch someone who is grabbing their phone and not to manufacture the result."
boardgames,3e21vz,SalaciousSarah,4,Tue Jul 21 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"Rules as Written, just had to have it in their hand.

boardgames,3e21vz,DnMarshall,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't say I was looking for balance. You asked for people's opinion, and I gave you mine. Or were you just looking for a bunch of virtual high fives?"

boardgames,3e21vz,-im_that_guy,7,Tue Jul 21 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah WDPTalphabet soup is a weird one to talk about precisely because it's silly, so it's sort of weird to get hung up on it. I know my attitude (and most of the people I play with's attitudes) would be that the minute you asked someone to hand you your phone/beer/pizza/whatever you were in essence momentarily ""pausing"" the game. It's not like we're playing Simon Says or anything. Now, if I knew that the game existed in a meta-space (like say, Mao or the Kings drinking game) it might be different. That's where it comes down to the group you're playing with.  The Netrunner example was to try to illustrate what I meant by stepping out of the bounds/circle of the game. Agenda's by rule can't be installed sideways like ICE. It's frequent in a game for a player to hem and haw or something, or potentially do something and take it back if nothing else has changed. The competitive scene is friendly like that. Some people argued that they should be able to pretend to install agendas sideways as misdirection. It always felt lame or cheap.  Also sorry if I came of antagonistically."

boardgames,3e21vz,DnMarshall,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:44 2015 UTC,You're that guy.
boardgames,3e21vz,DnMarshall,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"I'm torn, overall. You seem to have a good sense of humor, a good sense of sportsmanship, and are aware of the subtle social differences of when it is proper to be more or less cutthroat. So if you're that guy, you're a minor example.  If you're that guy, it's just because you define the bounds of ""a game"" to be the time period during which the game is being played, and encompassing all social behavior during that time. Other people restrict ""the game"" to the actual moves on the board, and exclude the concurrent social interactions unless the game explicitly calls for deception. People who expect the latter are often irritated by the former. Geeks particularly often prefer clean, optimizable win conditions, and intentionally seek out Boardgaming as a way to escape the stresses of social competition.   Including deception in a game without deception often rubs people the wrong way. It forces them (if they want to compete effectively) to fight with you socially as well as intellectually.  When someone says they don't want to play Avalon, what they're really saying is they don't want to engage in social competition. And you can force them into social competition by being deceptive. Or by trying to turn players against each other, or anything similar.   It's like if a 300 lb 6.5"" guy announced, ""the rules don't say we can't wrestle before each turn,"" then proceeded to headlock you each time anyone rolled the dice. You might still win the game, but you're going to be tired and pissed off by this guy's randomly injecting a strength contest into a game about worker placement. Substitute ""deception"" for ""strength"" and you might find your friends are a bit sweaty and irritated and wrestling with you when the rules of the game don't die-allow it but don't really call for it. Or a guy who turned every game into a drinking contest as a method to gain advantage. Extreme examples, meant to draw parallels.   Also, out of game deception introduces cognitive dissonance that many people find unpleasant.  I oppose you in the game, but I like you in real life. Those two spheres are separate. However, if you are deceptive or manipulative outside the game (but admittedly tangentially related), I now have to choose between winning the game, and being trusting and pleasant toward you outside the game. ""I like OP but I cannot trust or listen to him while we're doing an activity we enjoy"" is a pretty uncomfortable place to be for many people; you're essentially training them to dislike you. It seems stupid to extrapolate out from one silly example (WEPTtAA is a good example of when nonsense is more allowable). But you only gave us one example so that's all we have.   Personally, I would rate your behavior as ""irritating, but tolerable since OP has other redeeming qualities"".  That Guy Level: 3/10  tl;dr: Stressing out introverts with unwanted social manipulation is tacky."
boardgames,3e21vz,phil_s_stein,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:41 2015 UTC,One of the people I play with is the absolute worst. It's not that he's deceptive or manipulative or a bad winner - he just always picks the same person and throws away his own chances to help him to win at the expense of everyone else. It makes gaming with him incredibly boring as half way through the game he'll just stop playing properly and contrive to make this one person win. Then that one person doesn't even get a true victory!
boardgames,3e21vz,Notexactlyserious,0,Tue Jul 21 13:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's not a proper player, that's just someone who's givin up on winning but wants to still affect the board. Like someone playing catan and trading all their stuff for one thing."
boardgames,3e21vz,phil_s_stein,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:20 2015 UTC,Why do they do that? Is it a really sad attempt to Nice Guy himself into the other dude's bed?
boardgames,3e21vz,phil_s_stein,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:24 2015 UTC,I believe in this particular case it's just an attempt to wind people up. This is a group of old friends - although he does the same for new players!

Sometimes you're forced into Kingmaking near the end of a game, AGOT 2ed and Forbidden Stars both have this issue, but to set out to do it from the start is frustrating. Unless the two players working together are terrible at the game, a lone player cannot beat them.  I would concede a long game on turn 2 if I saw someone deliberately throwing themselves to cause another player to win."

It's one thing to be totally awesome at a game in a tournament kind of setting, it's another to suck the fun out of a game because you refuse to keep things social.  I guess it's mostly about being able to read the room and figure out what is best for the group, because in the end, it's a group activity and the goal is for everyone to have fun.  ... and now I feel bad because I just realized ""that guy"" is probably on the autism spectrum and can't actually read a group of people. :( BEING A HUMAN IS HARD!"

That being said, if I could count cards I would.    I also have a friend who really really wants me to lose every time and if he wins will never let me hear the end of it and I gotta say, he gets my goat.  Even if it was a fun social game before, it isn't now because he's talking shit and I've gotta shut him up.  So I escalate, then he escalates, then we're both bringing our A game.  I'm still having fun, and he's still having fun, but most everyone else is kind of lost."

You have to be the one with complete overview and introduce everything as a story instead of a new set of rules. I think it could work. Maybe remove some of the harder elements to make it more about the story than survival.
boardgames,3e0wm5,Bewble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:05 2015 UTC,"You can definitely play Carcassonne with her. Just remove the farmer scoring from the game. It is sometimes difficult for even adults to grasp this rule.  But this game will grow with her, and you can get expansions and add farmers back in later.   For light, quick games that are super fun and engaging, try Love Letter (original if she likes princesses, Batman or Hobbit if she likes fantasy, both Batman and Hobbit also have some differences which change game play up the tiniest bit), Sushi Go! is great.  Seven Dragons is a wonderful little card game with twists and turns, Dungeon Roll is a push your luck type of dice game that is very easy to learn but requires decision making and SOME skill.  If she is ok with zombies, Zombie Dice is crazy fun. Another push your luck easy to learn game.    All of these I play with my adult gamer group and all of them are loved completely, you may have to edit a rule here or there for some, but for the most part you can teach these to children as well. Just maybe don't get quite as cut throat or vocal when you win.  It is easy for some people to get nasty in Batman Love Letter when they eliminate you."

The official website contains no record of the Street Fighter card game but a quick translate of the about page shows you some info. Not perfect but you get the idea. Don't have time to translate it myself.   Seems you and your friends would simply decide a number of cards for a deck and just play cards? That's all I can find in any mention of rules. The Street Fighter cards were released around SF2 on SNES and separate sets of every SF2 game seem to have been released, including the movie(anime?).   Hard to find much more but Japanese auctions for them as they are about 20 years old.  Interesting note, Carddass is a pretty long running TCG company in Japan and in the 2000's made a big transition to arcade games. You can get booster packs or get single cards from little vending machines or get cards by playing the games and with a little bar code you load your cards up into the arcade cabinet to use in the game.   Big games now would include things like Dragon Ball: Heroes. My daughter is very big into Aikatsu where you get clothing cards and you dress your girl up for bonuses and play a rhythm game to become the top Idol.   Edit: Google image search"

For that, less games about shipping stuff or managing a port. My favorite Eurogames are Pillars of the Earth, where you are building at Cathedral(way more fun than it sounds) and Lords of Waterdeep(Fantasy sure, but that a bit unique for eurogames).   What type of theme would you like to see in those games?   I want to rephrase this as ""What type of theme would I like to see more of in games."" and for that I would say a pirate theme.

boardgames,3dz74b,7silence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"I was a bit let down by Fleet Commander. I was very excited when I found it at Funagaingames, but actual play has been mixed.  It's a gorgeous game, but the space combat is a wrapper on an abstract dice and positioning game.  It's all right, I suppose, but it feels more like a probability and prediction puzzle rather than space fleet combat.  I really want to like and I just... don't.  I haven't quite worked myself up to getting rid of it, though.  I have been interested in this Halo game for a while.  I never played the video game, but, as established above, I'll pretty much buy anything if it has plastic ships and dice."
boardgames,3dz74b,7silence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'll try...  The dice have arrows in them, indicating which quadrants you can attack into, move into or defend from; orthogonal, and diagonal.  There is also a face that lets you attack/defend/move in any direction.  If the enemy has ships right in front of you, for example, you need the orthogonal face to hit them, diagonal faces need to be spent elsewhere or are simply wasted.  Like-wise, if I am being attacked from a similar set-up, diagonal dice are useless.  You get set number of dice to roll per turn (3, IIRC) chosen from movement, attack and defense.  You can bank a few of them for later, but you are basically stuck moving and attacking however the dice will let you.  So, you need to position your ships and then hope for the best with your dice.  There is no, ""I move my ships close and pour everything into attack,"" or"" I will use the asteroids for cover and try to flank the enemy.""  It's more, ""Well, I guess I can go here and here and maybe next turn I will get the dice I need to move into the asteroid field.""  You can have banked shields and attacks that are completely useless when you need them most.  Maybe this just as abstract as more traditional war games, but I prefer to have more tactical control of my forces instead of relying on the whims of dice gods to maybe grant me what I need and make-do otherwise.  It's kind of hard to explain.  I hope you get the picture."

However, other than that there's perhaps primarily an emotional value of a limited collector's edition. This includes for example the larger game board, new dices and overall higher quality references and manual.

The 2nd Ed board only just fits on my table, and though a bigger board would give the minis more room, I don't need less table space.  I am not that fussed about the dice either. There are plenty of places to buy dice. I also don't need a box which is twice the size of the 2nd Ed. box.   I don't think that the price they are asking is that crazy: AU$500, as painting it yourself has a cost: WOTR $100; Primer $60; Paint $125; Brushes $40; Dip $35; Dullcoat $40 = AU$400 and then there is the associated time that it takes (which is considerable. I only fully painted all of the characters, companions, leaders and Shadow elites, painting all of the factions a different single color and that is already taking forever and some more).  So after shipping, is the extra AU$200 worth it - probably in terms of time saved and having every mini fully painted - that's a 'yes'. For the books, bigger board and dice - probably 'not'.  So I think, I am going to sit this one out and be content with what I have. If you have the cash then considering the time, effort and cost of doing this yourself it seems like a reasonable deal (and for those of you in US or Europe then shipping is so much better).  I really wish they had done the following (even though I wouldn't be able to afford it, lol):   Wooden box. Wooden tokens for all the cardboard counters. Rings: Elven rings and the One Ring instead of counters. Different art work for the map. The outside edge of each of the Political Counters to be color coded to their faction. A leather bag for the Hunt Pool. Wooden card holders for each player. Beautifully pimped cards with gold foil on them or such like (though I understand wanting to have compatibility with the expansions). And ok, combat dice for each player themed accordingly.   Maybe the Fantasy Edition? Coming soon?"
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,-5,Tue Jul 21 04:47:19 2015 UTC,This is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while... Small World's Designer Edition makes this look like a piece of garbage and it was only slightly more...
boardgames,3dz2rs,jwoodall04,5,Mon Jul 20 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think Small World was painted. It also doesn't compare to WOTR as a game. Beyond that, it was likely underpriced since it sold out in 5 minutes. :)"
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"First off I'll enlighten you to the differences between the two products (game play is subjective and everyone likes what they like)  WoR Anniversary Edition: Painted Plastic Miniatures Larger Game Board (exact same design just blown up)  And that's it for meaningful upgrades...  Small World Designer Edition: Wooden Box (gorgeous) Resign Figures (1000x better than plastic, even if they are painted) Metal Coins w/ purses ALL original CardBoard pieces have been made out heat-printed wood Expansions included with all upgraded materials Each race gets a gorgeous wood banner Plus metal and wooden emblishments to all other pieces such as a turn marker and other stuff.  WoR may be a more fun game for some people, but this Anniversary box is a fucking disgrace to boardgaming. Hell even Ticket to Ride did a better job and it was still under $200 with METAL painted figures (trains)  You can be a fan of a game all you want... Just don't let it blind you to the shitty nature of this product.  Also, even if they could have charged MORE for the Small World Designer Edition, they DIDN'T and still made a profit."
boardgames,3dz2rs,GreatGonzo,4,Mon Jul 20 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"You forgot the rules book being made into a hard cover as well as a hard cover strategy guide  And I don't thing the painting of over 200 minis can be cheap either.  380 delivered doesn't seem that astronomical in that sense.  I don't know what it would cost to paint that many minis but even if it was a dollar per, which sounds too cheap, that's 200 just for the painting, let alone the product which is around 60-70USD.  so that leaves less then 100 for the new books and artwork.  There is probably a premium added on a bit it's not as much as you would think"
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"The difference between a hardcover book and a soft cover is about 20cents so I left it out of the equation since it really doesn't add anything to the game itself and is a meaningless addition. Now if they did all new artwork then that's another story but as I've seen and heard everything is exactly the same as the original game except for a larger blown up board (with the same ugly image) and some painted plastic miniatures that cost pennies. They are painted in China so no, they do not cost a dollar each. We'll just have to wait and see the quality of this painting too since it's factory painted I doubt it will be more than just solid colours.  There's over 65 resin models in the Small World one, even painted plastic isn't as expensive as Resin."
boardgames,3dz2rs,GreatGonzo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:11 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I thought the difference in soft and hard cover books would have been bigger then that considering what they sell for in book stores but I don't really know.   There is new artwork for the books, done by the same guy that did the original artwork so maybe that is the difference.  At any rate I didn't see this as gouging the market, but it may be out of my reach.   There IS talk of making just the hardcover rules and strategy guides available, if that happens I will get a set for my plain jane copy of the game."
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, look it up. Hardcover novels are less than $1 more to make over their softcover versions... It's all what people will pay, exactly the same thing is happening with this thing"
boardgames,3dz2rs,sigma83,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't there be a significant bump in cost to ship due to the weight? I'm not talking about 1 copy in the box like you get here, but to ship 2000+ of them."
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:19 2015 UTC,That's highly possible and something I never thought of. The only thing I've seen referenced was the very small increased cost to produce. Though I know they did say most of the most of a hardcover was purely due to implied expense. The idea that it's more expensive means they can charge more
boardgames,3dz2rs,jwoodall04,3,Tue Jul 21 06:41:19 2015 UTC,"There is no real difference in cost between plastic and resin. I don't know what type of resin they are claiming, but the only real ""benefit"" there is that it is natural, I guess. It isn't more stable and densities obviously vary.  There's no real difference printing on some graphics on wood either vs plastics. I mean, the wood costs more, but nowhere near the scale of actual paint labor.  TTR trains are plastic and are not hand painted.  The cost is in the painting. Labor costs money when it isn't done by machines, even when sent to Asia. Nothing in Small World or TTR was done by hand. Go price miniature painting for 205 miniatures with a very basic scheme and you can see that.  The Small World designer edition reminds me a whole lot of the Catan anniversary (which I own and paid $115) for... I suspect DOW made more money on SW than Ares will make on WOTR on a unit basis.  I was also just kidding about Small World not being as good. I think it is one of the last great games designed before the entire industry went off the god damn rails."
boardgames,3dz2rs,SLOKnightfall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"""I suspect DOW made more money on SW than Ares will make on WOTR on a unit basis.""     It could be possible, but I doubt it. SW cost DoW more to produce than they originally planned.  While they did raise the price on the small retail run to $450, the majority of the sets sold were from the Kickstarter for $320 at a loss."
boardgames,3dz2rs,barf_the_mog,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:07:36 2015 UTC,I hate Smallworld yet completely agree with this.
boardgames,3dz2rs,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:03 2015 UTC,That's all my point was. Even if you hate Small World you really have to hand it to them for the Designer Edition. It's a beautiful piece of art and really shows what a special edition should be
boardgames,3dxyfv,Epsilon_balls,10,Mon Jul 20 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone!  We didn’t play as much as we planned on this week, but it was a solid a week for gaming.  Legendary - 2 plays, 2 players.  This game is quickly making it way toward our top 10 played games even though we bought it recently.  It’s feels very unique even though we have other deckbuilding games and the theme is engaging.  This was our first plays with Dark City and Paint the Town Red.  The schemes in Dark City are much more interesting than those in the base game.  I loved the wall crawl ability from paint the town red as it made for some fun combos.  This one will continue to hit the table frequently especially with Secret Wars coming out soon.  Merchants and Marauders - 1 play, 2 players.  We cranked up the Pirates of the Carribean soundtrack and set sail! Seas of Glory arrived this week so for the second week in a row we got to play MM.  I’m glad we had the chance to play 2 weeks in a row because it’s one of my favorite games and it hadn’t been played in quite some time.  We only added in the first 2 modules from the expansions, but I’m enjoying it already. We started the board with NPCs in play which made for a much better 2 player game.  After some failed missions, failed rumors, and never upgrading my cargo slot I suffered a 10-6 loss.  When I was a merchant I had those darn pirates chasing me down and when I was marauders those pesky nations just wouldn’t leave me alone.  My SO played much better and easily sailed to victory.  I’m looking forward to adding in the next modules.  Libertailia - 2 plays, 2 players.  I was a little worried before we got this game because multiple people described it as mean.  It actually went much better than I thought it would.  It was still mean, but with 2 players it’s not that bad because you are going back and forth, messing each other up the entire game.  I could see some people not enjoying it with more players if they keep getting the short end of the stick.  I love how quickly it plays and how simple the gameplay is.  I think my favorite part of the game is knowing exactly which cards your opponent has and trying to predict their next move.  Dead Men Tell No Tales - 1 play, 2 players.  Pirate week continues.  Something is just so charming about this game.  I think it's the deckhands that have gotten me hooked.  Everything was going just fine and we were on our way to victory when all of the sudden the fire got out of control and multiple explosions block our path to the exit!  I think we need to swap items more often and focus a little bit more often and focus more on the fire levels.    Imperial Settlers - 1 play, 2 players.  We added in the Why Can’t We Be Friends expansion this week.  We actually didn’t end up using any of the open production buildings, but the new cards were a welcome addition.  I think in the future we may try out the peaceful variant since we hardly raze each other’s buildings.  We probably should, but we’re too busy worrying about our own tableaus.    Terra Mystica - 1 play, 2 players.  Another new expansion.  We played with the Fire and Ice expansion and each played with a new race.  I took the Dragonlords and my SO took the Ice Maidens.  I got off to a strong start thanks to the Dragonlords ability to terraform easily.  We played with the additional end game scoring condition that gave points for having the most building along the edge of the map which  made the dragonlords even stronger.  We both played very well and it ended up being a close game despite my strong start.  I barely pulled of the win in a tense game.  I’m excited to try out some of the other races on the new maps and to try the other two races that came with the expansion.  Krosmaster Arena - 2 plays, 2 players.  Yet ANOTHER expansion!  Frigost arrived this week and of course we had to try it out.  We didn’t get to push any of the ice blocks around, but I loved the map.  I really liked that the expansion came with an entirely new set of demonic rewards.  I played fairly defensively, but was able to corner my SO and pull out the win.  We also got a bunch of new characters so we got in a game on the regular map so we could try them out.  I love just creating a random team and seeing how I can do with them.  Not Mines is up next!   My favorite game I never get to play is Pit. I haven't played it in YEARS and I love it.  So many great memories, but for some reason it just has't been played since I was a kid.  As for a heavier game I wish I played Mage Knight more often.  We played it a couple of times when we first got it, but we haven't pulled it out since.  I really enjoyed it and need to play it again soon.  My collection is 157 games and 56 expansions/promos for a total of 213 total.  It's been constantly expanding and I don't think it will stop any time soon."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:22 2015 UTC,Is Krosmaster Arena fairly balanced and with an easy entry level? Like will I be missing out on much if I don't pick up tons of expansions? I have been looking at it for a while but I don't know that I can support two miniature gaming habits.
boardgames,3dxyfv,Norsbane,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"Hm, good question. I'll start of by saying I haven't play too many games with the characters that game in the base game ONLY, but I'd say they are fairly balanced.  They're abilities are pretty basic and I don't think any of them stand out too much. Perhaps someone who just has the base game can comment on this more.   As for the entry level I would say it's very easy to get in to. The rules for the base game are easy to understand and there are a bunch of tutorials to get you started. The tutorials can be kind of boring, but to me they were betting than jumping right in. If you do decide to get the game 8 would recommend also downloading the season 2 rules from bgg because they make the game less luck based.   Regarding the expansions, there's a ton of them and some of them are definitely better than others, but I think you could get by with the base game for a while. The big expansion (Frigost) only adds one characters so you're better off just getting the window packs. They're cheap enough on Amazon and Miniature Market has a bunch of them on clearance right now. I don't think they're being made any more so you might want to get them while you can. I believe moving forward they are moving to blind boxes only.   You could probably get 1 or 2 that you like in addition to the base game and that would provide you with enough variety to keep things interesting for a while. The good thing about having a bunch of people to choose from is that each character has a level (everybody is a 3 in the base game) and you're team should have a total level of 12. Without a big selection of people to choose from you may end up with a weaker team because you can't quite hit 12.   With all that being said I love the game (the art is probably my favorite of any game) and think it was easily worth the investment so far. My only problem is there's not a ton of support for rules questions which is annoying because each character is unique and there are so many interactions that can happen. Some people also may find the game a little fiddly, but once you have a couple of games under your belt it plays much smoother.   Out of curiosity what other miniatures game do you play? Let me know if you have any other questions!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"I only have the base, and I feel it is fairly balanced. You get 8 characters, so there is some variety there."
boardgames,3dxyfv,soupness,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"I am glad to hear someones experience with Dead Men Tell No Tales, that is one of the games on my wishlist which I keep thinking about purchasing, I just wanted to hear more experiences with it first."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tigerzroze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"It's really been great. I don't have a ton of plays in so I'm not sure how it will hold up over time, but there ways to increase the difficulty which I think will keep us going back to it."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"Well I am more convinced now to buy it! My group tends to lean toward co-ops more, so it will be nice to get another one with a different theme :-D"
boardgames,3dxyfv,tigerzroze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I hope you enjoy it. It had a nice Flash Point feel without being as random. Flash Point is one of my favorite, but it's nice to change it up."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Flash Point, it is on my wishlist, but I have played quite a few other co-op games, Pandemic, Escape! Robinson Crusoe, Forbidden Island, Semi Co-Op- Dead Of Winter, Kinda Specter Ops, Legendary Marvel, so ya, I don't mind having more haha. Maybe I will just have to get both!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,tigerzroze,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"I had a bit of a rough first game. We found the rules a bit vague but we really should have read them through before diving right in. I think once we have the hang of it, it will see lots of time at the table."
boardgames,3dxyfv,pimplezoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:49 2015 UTC,They are somewhat vague. I know a bunch of people had trouble with the 'spread out' mechanic for the deckhands.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:29:39 2015 UTC,The iconography on the Skellits revenge cards is not really explained well. We did have the most trouble with the deckhands as you mentioned.
boardgames,3dxyfv,pimplezoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:29 2015 UTC,Ah yes that's true too. I'm surprised it wasn't more clear since to me the game was very well made.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"I am edging closer to buying Merchants and Marauders.  It sounds like my kind of game.  (If it was space ships, I would probably already own it.)  Can you comment on the rumors I've heard that focusing on the PU&D aspect of Merchants is a strategy that wins more often than not?"
boardgames,3dxyfv,7silence,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"Being a Merchant and focusing on the pick up and deliver aspect is definitely a strong strategy especially depending on which cargo you find and what is in demand near you. It is the 'safer' way to go because there are less pirates (controlled by the game) hunting merchants (the players) than there are naval ships (controlled by the game) hunting pirate players. The thing is being a pirate does not mean you can't also do the pick up and deliver part and gives you even more ways to score points so a mix of both is ideal.   With more than 2 players the PU&amp;D becomes weaker because the other players can gang up on anyone playing it safe and sink their ship causing them do lose everything they have. If you are going to play with two players I'd recommend using the variant that puts naval ships/pirates on the board at the beginning of the game to make it a little more tense.   The thing about the pu&amp;d strategy is that it is guaranteed points as long as you can get to the port which wants the goods you have before anyone else (which usually isn't too hard). Also, this strategy gives you gold which is also worth more points. You get 1 point for delivering and at least 18 gold (every 10 gold is worth 1 point up to 5). However, a player who is doing this and also doing other pirate things to score points will have a much better chance at winning. There is some luck involved when trying to score points other ways which is why they are not quite as 'safe', but they are worth the risk!  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you ignore the pu&d part of the game your chances of winning will probably go down, but it shouldn't be the focus of the game and as you play with your group you'll start to see how people play and adjust your strategy accordingly forcing them to play differently.   That being said, while this game has solid gameplay it's the theme that draws me in. If someone wants to play it safe I have no problem with that because I'm too busy raiding merchants ships, chasing rumors, completing missions, and upgrading my ship to care!  I hope this helps :) If you have any more questions let me know."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply!  My FLGS has a copy.  I think I need to give it a play.
boardgames,3dxyfv,7silence,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:24 2015 UTC,No problem! Definitely worth at least a try.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"Up vote for Pit! Played it when I was growing up with the family. Very, very fond memories of that one."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bleuchz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:18 2015 UTC,Same here. I picked up a deluxe copy a long time ago and I still haven't had the chance to play it!
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"Love the pirate themed week. Libertalia has been on my radar since Tabletop, and I'll have to look into Merchants and Marauders as well.  Major plus points for having the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack. Sounds amazing."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:22 2015 UTC,The soundtrack really adds to the gameplay :) We're planning on having an entire pirate themed day with eye patches and rum and all that jazz!   Libertalia was a nice little surprise for us and I can't recommend Merchants and Marauders enough. I love how well the theme and the mechanics mesh together.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"Libertalia seems to hit the right notes for me: great art, short play-time, light-enough that it's easy to introduce but with a bit of bluffing, card-counting, and strategy.  I'll have to look into Merchants and Marauders, though. Any color you could provide that could ultimately sway me?"
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'd say that you should get it if you're interested in a game that will really draw you in thematically.  If you and your group are the type of people who will play to have fun and don't mind too much conflict you'll love this game.  Sure you can be a merchant and try to sneak by just delivering cargo, but if you play with the right people they won't let that happen or you can be a pirate and wreak havoc throughout the Caribbean, but you have to watch out because it may lead to your downfall if you get too many bounties on your head.    You may read that being a merchant is too strong, but then you'll also read that being a pirate is just as good.  You're group will adjust for this and I'd recommend that everybody always try a different strategy even if they think one way or the other is an easy win.  One other thing I love is that there are multiple paths to victory.  You can win through a combination of delivering cargo, raiding merchants, completing missions, stashing gold, following rumors, and battling other players.  Each game is so different to due to this and the fact that the game comes with plenty of cards and the expansion adds even more!    I hope this helps :) Let me know if you have any more questions!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:57 2015 UTC,libertalia is a great game but I think it is very fair to say that the pirate theme is more or less completely pasted on.
boardgames,3dxyfv,ISmashCheezits,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"I really been enjoying Marvel Legendary as well. We're still using the base game currently, but we're looking forward to adding the GotG expansion.   I'm really interested in Libertalia. The Tabletop episode made it look pretty fun."
boardgames,3dxyfv,cromusz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:20 2015 UTC,I'm sure we'll be getting that one eventually too. It's a shame that we got into the game too late and now the Fantastic Four expansion is out of print.   Libertalia very good! The 'take that' to time played ratio is just right for me.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Marvel Legendary. Dark City is almost a must, but I actually think my next choice would be Fantastic Four. I just love focusing! Secret Wars actually looks kind of intimidating to me. I only get to play Legendary occasionally, and there are already so many cards and configurations thereof that I haven't used yet."
boardgames,3dxyfv,fissionessence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:42 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I just went looking for the Fantastic Four expansion yesterday only to realize that it's out of print and that they have no plans to print it ever again. I do love how there's endless possibilities for set up. I can't wait to see what Secret Wars adds.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Good morning! Lot's of family in town so got in some fun games.  Survive! - Played with my sisters who both enjoyed eating each other with sea monsters. This has to be a Top 5 gateway game and is always a success when it hits the table. So glad my Secret Santa went off wishlist for this one.  Star Realms - Taught my little bro who immediately crushed me and curled up on the couch with the tablet to hammer out more games. Glad he liked it and picked up on it quick. It was his first deckbuilder.  Kingdom Builder - Played with two of my siblings. They didn't quite get it, but honestly I think this game needs a bunch of plays to figure out what is a good turn vs bad. I'm liking it more with each play, and trying to think really far ahead vs just going straight for action tiles so I don't get locked in. Brilliant? No, but I'm glad I've given it a few more shots.  Mage Knight - My bro and I finally played together. I'd love to play with some more experienced people, as I don't understand how you'd ever kill the big dragons or some of the larger monsters. Do people just grind at monastaries and stuff to buy better abilities for a while?     Android. Rare to hit the table but love it every time. Large enough. Just over 100 games (including numerous expansions, so probably closer to 60-70). Not actively reducing or actively expanding, just keeping an eye our for games that interest me. Purchasing will slow now that there is a baby (until he can play!)."
boardgames,3dxyfv,captainraffi,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"as I don't understand how you'd ever kill the big dragons or some of the larger monsters.   Essentially, you start the game as too weak to achieve end-game stuff and most of the game is you acquiring more and more power. Power such as:   Units, especially elites but also some others (illusionists shut down a dragon like nobody's business) Artifacts, these are big. They're generally good, but when you're doing your last few fights you can just trash the cards for their super effect. Base game Horn of Wrath? Broken as hell Spells, with and without black mana. Some of these can wreck entire cities just like that   And how do you get those? Go out there and wreck stuff. Monasteries provide easy artifacts (though at times the reputation hit can hurt). Dungeons and tombs are my personal favourites. Dungeons in particular are pretty easy for an encounter that's guaranteed to get you a spell or an artifact. But you work with what you get, I've had games where there were almost no mage towers for instance. Sometimes you get good access to spells, sometimes units, sometimes whatever.  Key skill in MK, I find, is taking the appropriate number of wounds. Do you never take any wounds? Odds are you play too slow, too cautiously. Do you take too many wounds and slow down as a result? Better restrain yourself a bit. Think of wounds as a resource. ""If I take 1-2 wounds now, but level up and gain an artifact/spell/advanced action in the process, it's worth it"".  Do you just play the base game or with expansions? I've heard that the expansions make it a wee bit more difficult, at least for (relative) newbies. Best keep it basic for a while as you learn."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tiny_markatas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"So far base game, and the intro scenario at that. It just seems like the mage towers pop out well before I have any fire/ice abilities that I'd want to use to attack them."
boardgames,3dxyfv,captainraffi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:50 2015 UTC,You can defeat mage towers using only the cards in your starting deck...just means you're probably taking some wounds in the process. I'll take 4 wounds if it means getting some early spells.
boardgames,3dxyfv,Show-Me-Your-Moves,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:14 2015 UTC,This has to be a Top 5 gateway game and is always a success when it hits the table.   I played a game of Survive! this weekend as well and I fully agree with you.  I find it works very well with kids. I introduced it to my 12 & 13 year old cousins and they loved it.
boardgames,3dxyfv,JayRedEye,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add Kingdom Builder to my collection, but I'm not sure it would get played very much. I need to look into it a bit more. The tabletop episode didn't really sell me on it.  Mage Knight looks like a lot of fun. How well does it play with only 1 players?"
boardgames,3dxyfv,cromusz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:47 2015 UTC,Most of my Mage Knight plays are only 1 player :) It plays really well that way.
boardgames,3dxyfv,captainraffi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've played it a few times with two and about 8-10 games solo. It can be fun with the right person, but I do prefer it solo.   There's a lot of variance because the map tiles you uncover come from a shuffled pile, additional cards (units, abilities, spells etc.) come from shuffled decks, monster tokens get drawn from shuffled piles. There's a ton of randomness in setup, keeping it fresh play after play despite no human opponent."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tiny_markatas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:41 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Thank you for the details.
boardgames,3dxyfv,cromusz,4,Mon Jul 20 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"This week I only played a couple games.  Played:  Alhambra Played this for the first time, found it quite enjoyable, like the sort of over arching strategy that you need to have and then adapt it to what tiles show up on the board.  Sentinels of the Multiverse Played this for the second time this week, its fun set deck game where you have to work together to defeat a villain. Something I enjoy playing but probably wouldn't buy it.  Love Letter While waiting for the train on the weekend busted out love letter and got a few rounds in. Still my groups favorite game for killing time while waiting for stuff.  My favorite game that I never get to play is Space Alert Its a game that I thoroughly enjoy but can't seem to sell it to my group.  I currently own 20 games of varying themes and styles, always looking to expand it and broaden the horizons of my group."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Adaptation01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"I've had the same problem with Space Alert. It's a game that benefits from playing with the same people, so I had to sell it to my main group and was finally able to play.  What helps I think is trying to sell on the humor. Looking out the window; running into walls; general chaos."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"I just can't get them to wrap their heads around it, the listening to the audio track and working together with the cards in your hand just seem to not work well together."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Adaptation01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but for some reason, after knowing of its existence for something like three years, I've decide that I absolutely have to have Space Alert this week.  It looks like just so much fun, and I really like real-time co-op.  Well, I sort of like real-time co-op.  I'm hoping to trade Escape! The Curse of the Temple for Space Alert.  Escape is a load of fun and I still like to bring it out with people who don't play as much, but the fact that it's only ten minutes makes for a rather weird dynamic whenever we play games.  People usually want to play it maybe twice, but then getting them to transition to another game is sometimes difficult."
boardgames,3dxyfv,refudiat0r,4,Mon Jul 20 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"Big week for me as I just bought 6 new games.  Coup - Finally got around to adding this to my collection. Probably should have been in there sooner. It's a great small game, and I love the bluffing aspects. Though I feel like a player ending up with a combination of Captain and Contessa might be a bit strong if nobody challenges them. Could just be that my group wasn't very aggressive with the challenging.  Star Realms - Absolutely love it. Got it to fill in the fact that I was lacking in 2 player games, and it has quickly risen to one of my favorites. While it's not very complex the game has enough randomness so that no two games feel the same. Getting off big plays and buying up good card combinations just feels great.  Epic Spell Wars - The gameplay reminds me of roguelike video games in that you'll probably get eliminated early, but it doesn't matter because you'll be back soon. A great game for when you want something with a little bit of strategy, but don't want to spend too much effort thinking.  Cosmic Encounter - Finally got a copy of this (last one at my FLGS at that). Only got about 2 games in, but didn't use flares or tech cards and only used the beginner aliens. Definitely seems to have a lot of replayability, though some races end up feeling a bit hard to play against (Zombies), especially if the destiny deck never sends anybody after them. That being said, I do like the destiny deck as it lets you not be responsible if you happen to attack somebody doing poorly.  Also picked up Five Tribes and the Netrunner core set, but haven't gotten to play either yet. Also got in the last of my Super Dungeon Explore Kickstarter items. I fear that I will soon run out of space for SDE items.  Speaking of Super Dungeon Explore, it would take the spot of my favorite game that I never get to play. The size and complexity of it makes it a bit hard to get to the table, but I love the art style and find it to be quite fun. Though I do feel I'll have to do some rule tweaking to balance out some of the game."
boardgames,3dxyfv,pieaholicx,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"I played a lot this week, 7 Wonders, King Of Tokyo, Pandemic, DC Deck Builder, Legendary Marvel DB, and Survive! Escape From Atlantis.   Favorite game I never get to play, well I just traded away Robinson Crusoe for this very reason.  I have about 40 games right now, still expanding, but not by much, mostly trading a couple games that didn't click for our group."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tigerzroze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"I almost purchased Robinson Crusoe this weekend. It looks like a lot of fun, but I'm not sure it would hit the table very often. Games with a lot of parts seem to bugger down my game group pretty easily."
boardgames,3dxyfv,cromusz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"You definitely would want to organize the box via plano, or insert, otherwise set up takes forever! It is a great game though, and if you have time to play it, it is worth it."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tigerzroze,3,Mon Jul 20 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Got some games in Monday night:  Started off with Stratego. H wiped the floor with me. I suck at Stratego.  Moved on to Theseus: The Dark Orbit. This was a runaway for H too. She played the Greys faction and I had the Scientists. Very early on she was able to install the Greys action card that lets you move to any sector you wish which I had a hard time overcoming.   Ended with The Duke. First play. Initial reaction – this game is great! Like Chess only fun. I like some randomness in the games I play so I like drawing tiles from the bag. I won pretty much on accident, as this was the first learning game, but I can see this hitting the table a lot… and we actually played it two more times the next time we had some time to play games, on Saturday night. H won both of those games. My only slight complaint so far is that the game seems a bit long for what it is; though that may just be due to us being so new at it. On the box it claims something like 15-25 minutes, our games seem to be more around 40 to nearly 60 minutes. It could also be that we are pretty evenly matched. The next few games we are likely to start playing with the Dragon and Mountain tiles, to see how those affect the game. Might even consider picking up an expansion or two fairly soon, but so far we both really, really enjoy it.   Questions:   Scrabble. I've played a ton of Scrabble since I was a teenager which has led to a reputation of being relatively good at the game and now I can't really get anyone to play with me anymore.  We're at 114 total including expansions. We've actually gotten rid of a few games recently (Munchkin Deluxe, Smash Up, Shadows Over Camelot, Dungeon) but with Gen Con looming our collection is likely to expand. We're in the process of redoing a closet in the house to make it the official board game closet, so that should give us plenty of room to grow."

boardgames,3dxyfv,gamerthrowaway_,3,Mon Jul 20 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"First off my weekly board game night:  Lords of Waterdeep with Scoundrels of Skullport - 4 Players - I was the lord that required buildings and quests from Skullport. I couldn't manage to get any buildings because two people were majorly fighting over them (I assumed one was the builder). But managed to complete some good quests including a 40 point one, and managed my corruption well. I finished with a solid 129 but my GF indeed had the builder and jumped past me with 139 putting me in second place.  Libertalia - 4 Players - I don't know if this game is just super luck based, or I am just that bad at it. Finished last place by quite a bit again. Oh well.  Then on Sunday me and my GF went to check out a new board game café, Tabletop, down in Cleveland. We played quite a few games there.  Kingdom Builder - 2 Players - This game was very meh for me. I've heard either really good things or really bad things about this game, and I might be in the latter camp. Just didn't feel like I ever had any decisions to make. Maybe it's just me. I won though, so there is that.  Castles of Mad King Ludwig - 2 Players - I liked this game way more than I thought I would, especially because I so dislike Carcassone. It was a blast though. I built a pretty banging castle and trounced my GF. Wanna play again with more players, gonna convince my brother to buy it.  Tokaido - 3 Players - One of the workers taught us this game. I've always considered buying it because it's gorgeous and cool but was worried there wasn't enough actual game to it. The girl teaching us butchered the rules quite a bit but still got a feel for the game. And I think there is just enough game for me to justify getting it down the road. It's real relaxing, good way to start or end a game night. My GF won by a bit but again we messed up a ton of rules.  Sushi Go - 2 Players - Felt like a crazy light 7 Wonders, which is a game we love. Not much else to say other than I got creamed at it."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tweakedsynth,3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:49 2015 UTC,Sushi Go   This game shines with 3+. It can be a bit of a memory game with two and an opponent can get frustrated easily.
boardgames,3dxyfv,ProjektTHOR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,Libertalia   If you are against experienced players who know what a really good hand looks like you can find yourself down early. With a couple more plays under belt you'll be right there at the top.
boardgames,3dxyfv,pimplezoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:59 2015 UTC,castles is way better with 3 or 4 players. 4 is probably ideal. You don't really get the full experience of how the economy is supposed to work with 2 people in my experience.
boardgames,3dxyfv,ISmashCheezits,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"Good morning!  So on Tuesday I got my first play of Alchemists in. First of all, the components are freaking top-notch.  The artwork was amazing and I thought it was great that there's an app. The gameplay is great, too: adding a bit of logic and deduction in addition to the worker placement.  I got absolutely destroyed, as I thought we played 3 rounds of 3 turns, as opposed to what actually happens with the alchemy tournament.  On Thursday, we had Puerto Rico. Still only my second playthrough overall, and I came in second since the runaway winner misplayed at the end and didn't fill his 10-cost building at the end.  Puerto Rico is absolutely phenomenal. There's so much strategy and depth to the gameplay, and you can look back at your overall game and see how you can improve.  On Saturday, we had a good game day:  Agricola: 2P. Taught a dear friend this one. Since it was her first game, I focused more on introducing the mechanics and trying to keep it engaging, and I think it went well! We had a close score (32-31 in my favor), and we would've played again if not for. . .  Castles of Burgundy: 2P. Still my personal favorite game. PLAYS LIKE BUTTER. I won a close game, but due to a crafty final phase Castle into Chickens play. Those chickens.  Later that night, we had:  Dead of Winter: 4P. Traitor had the very last turn, and she was able to tank morale since I left my guys to die in an overrun location since I needed it for my secret objective. REGRETS.  Pandemic: 4P. Legendary. We lost.  DISCUSSIONS:  1.) I never play Dominion anymore, which makes me somewhat sad. I'll look to get it out to the table soon, but for now Dominion will always be the first modern board game I bought.  2.) I have a grand total of 14 games, and I'm even looking to downsize a bit. I've got copies of Dixit: Journey and Star Realms which my group isn't too fond of. Of course there are 10 or so games on my BGG wishlist that I'm looking to purchase as well."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:17 2015 UTC,I was the same way with Dominion and it was also my first game. We recently we put all of the expansions into one box with labels/dividers so it should be getting played much more often now.

I've already looked up foam-core insert plans and labels, and it's been on the back of my mind for a while. I only have the base game right now, but I've though of expanding, most likely to Prosperity and Seaside.  It's just that I never seem to get the game out for whatever reason, so I can't seem justify getting an expansion yet."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"A typically busy summer week for kids sports meant not as many plays as I would have liked.  Still managed to play:  Patchwork This was intended to be a game for my wife and I, we have yet to play it together, but it has become a go-to game for my son and I when time is limited.  Such a solid, simple but satisfying game.    Broom Service Managed to pick this game up at an FLGS in the city we were visiting for a soccer tournament ( our FLGS has yet to get it in ).  Already we have 3 x 4P plays behind us and I can’t wait for all  5 of us to be able to sit down and play.  Very fun family game with an endearing theme and great artwork/components.  It will likely overtake King of Tokyo as the go-to family game we play when the girls are at the table.  The Voyages of Marco Polo Completed our first full play through.   I really enjoyed this more traditional Euro take on dice placement.  My other dice placement game is Alien Frontiers which I rate highly but I think Marco Polo jumps to number one in the category in my book.  I need to put in a couple more plays before I can say for sure.  I like the non-blocking mechanic as well as the various role and objectives cards.    Viticulture arrived this week and we got it to the table but had to leave it there for the weekend as we were out of town.  We completed 3 rounds, with 3 players, and we were really starting to get into it.  We will definitely finish this up ASAP this week.  I have a really hard time getting Archipelago to the table.  I am actually entertaining offers for the game now.  I love the look, theme, game play but just can’t get other’s interested   We are up to almost 40 games and climbing.  We are very new to the hobby having only gotten started in March of this year.  We have worked hard to research and buy games that satisfy various mechanics, complexities, play times, and audiences."

boardgames,3dxyfv,fissionessence,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Cacao ( 2x 3p and 4p)- Still a great short game. Easy to teach and easy to play. I still haven't figured out how to deal with the stupid insert...  Viceroy: (2x 2p- different players)- I got two plays of this one in, and it's definitely a LOT of fun. It feels similar to 7 Wonders in that you've got cards that do a lot of different things that get you points and you pick a couple of them. I would rather play this with two players any day of the week, but with 3+, I'd probably go with 7 Wonders.  Broom Service: (4p)- Got this out with 4 players- EXCELLENT! What a fun, fun game. It's so simple to play (maybe not super easy to teach), but it has lots of really fun choices. I played horribly and tied for last lol. Definitely coming back out this week for game night.  Five Tribes: (3p)- I certainly don't think of this as a favorite, but every time it comes out I really enjoy it. It looks really complicated, but its so easy to teach and play. Looking forward to the expansion.  Jamaica: (4p)- Second play of this. I held off on getting this one because it seemed so light, but I'm really glad I picked it up for $30. It's very fun and great for the family or lighter gamers, but I think anyone can enjoy it. Very simple, but it has enough decisions to keep it fun. Great components and production overall. Another one that I lost terribly...  Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island: (2p)- Finally got this one out and played it with my partner. This is probably the most thematic game I've ever played. Super fun and the rules aren't that complicated once you get the train rolling. We played the intro scenario and both died halfway through the game having made almost no progress toward the goal lol. Can't wait to play it more.   My favorite game that I never get to play is probably Dungeon Petz. I love love love that game, so I should probably try to get it out for game night this week. Another one I love but we haven't played in forever is Drum Roll. Beautiful art and fun gameplay. I have about 275 games plus a TON of expansions and promos. I'm trying to slow it down a bit, but it's always growing lol. I trade or sell out about half as much as I buy so that slows it down a little, but my space is pretty much full so I need to chill it out lol."
boardgames,3dxyfv,takabrash,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:45 2015 UTC,I also need to get Dungeon Petz out this week.  Its my #1 game and it's been months since I've played.  Hopefully we both get to it!  I'm surprised to hear you sell/trade often.  Do you find yourself just getting tired of games or regretting your purchases?  I'm afraid to get above around 200 because I'm afraid I'll never remember the rules to anything.
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,3,Mon Jul 20 23:50:57 2015 UTC,First time posting in one of these.  Wife and I got in 3 or 4 games of Lord of the Rings LCG. We attempted to play Shadows of Brimstone but after doing minitaures for 3.5 hours and reading rules for 2 hours I just said to heck with this and tried to watch the Lonely Gamer play through. Eldritch Horrror sadly only 1 game of this. I can't explain it but this is continuing to be my favorite game to play. I think it comes from familiarity. We managed to get through our first game w/o consulting the rules once. We've got the setup and tear down so well that it makes it very appealing to play. Lastly we did get in another beginner scenario of Mage Knight. We absolutely love this game but it just takes so long. From set up to actually playing the game. I'll admit the bulk of the time is me being anal and wanting to make sure I have every single rule correct. But it is what it is.  Really hope to pin down the rules to at least get a game up and running of Shadows of Brimstone.
boardgames,3dxyfv,vikrum2083,3,Mon Jul 20 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"Wednesday Meetup   Nicht die Bohne: 4 Player, first play. What a great card game. It isn't really trick taking, but hand building? Anyway the idea is you all play a card and the person who starts takes whatever he wants. Then that person takes, etc. You can never take the first person's: That is left for last card. So if you want that last card you play something bad so nobody wants yours, but if you don't want it play something you think the start player will want. There are negative cards that make that suit score negative, but you can get a second one to make it positive again. There is a x2 multiplier. Finally the nicht die bohne card in each suit automatically makes you score 0 for that suit. I ended with -6, which got me 3rd.  Broom Service : 5 player, 2nd play. People who read my posts in the SdJ thread might think I dislike this game, but that is definitely not the case. This is an incredibly fun game, similar in vein to Revolution. My only negative, which is totally based on opinion, is that I dislike events in games. I don't mind the small ones like ""if you choose cowardly you can ignore and take an inventory item"", but I hate the big ones that completely alter your strategy or screw specific people over. We ended with the one that hurt if you weren't in mountains, just as I entered the farthest away hill to deliver an 8 pointer. Meanwhile the guy who was slightly in the lead was already in 2 mountains, so he just delivered, fairy to up that score, and then did 2 gathers to complete a set. Or how about when the 9 point card came out the turn yellow had spent all of his goods but one? He was winning before that. Yellow really played the best game of brave/coward and role selection, and yet didn't win because of the events.  Flick Em Up - 5 player, 2nd play. After an abysmal first time, I started off just as rough. But then all of a sudden I hit a 2nd gear and got some sweet revenge. I was shooting really well the last 3 turns, including winning a double duel from pretty far away. In the end we won because the opponent's didn't think to pick up the gold as their first action, so we went in and dueled to kick out that guy. If they had, we probably would have lost. Phew!  Spinderella 3 player, first play. Really fun little roll and move. Came down to the wire and I won on a tree stump.  Friday Meetup:  Machi Koro: 5 player, 2nd play. Ugh.  Trains: Rising Sun: 3 player, countless plays. I own this game so I taught. I took a big chance taking waste in what I knew would be my last deck go through, but I had the most LET's and recycling centers and biofuels. I just need to lay track into a 5 coin city, that was 8 points. Well getting 2 of the lay rails with 2 waste and a station expansion was brutal. Getting the third one I had with the nearly exact same setup was even more brutal. I got last, but as I guessed I was only 6 away. I really like this game.  Tokaido - 5 player, countless plays. This game is incredibly boring after you've played a couple times. You just walk and take the card. I was the painter so I just went for panoramas. I completed all 3 thanks to luck encounter cards (but only got the achievement for 2/3). Still that was obviously enough to win with all food and a late temple donation for a tie for 2nd.  Questions:   I wouldn't say there is any game I don't get to play. It was Dominant Species but I traded that away. I think the least played now is El Grande because I like it at exactly 5, but I still find time for it. I am at 58. I very slowly expand. I mostly play at meetups and have to really want a game to want to buy it. I also trade a lot. I think I've bought 5 this year, traded for 7. I've really slowed down."

boardgames,3dxyfv,PaxCecilia,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:18 2015 UTC,I maintain that I had genius role selection in Broom Service and I won because of sheer talent....  But yea I did clean up that one round because of Events and the current state of the board.
boardgames,3dxyfv,ScubaSteveEL,3,Mon Jul 20 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"Quite a nice week for me (and I even skimped on a few plays that I had planned):  Warfighter came on the table again and still keeps me highly entertained. Still would like this to be more fantasy or scifi themed, but due to the great entertaining factor I can live with the theme which is a bit outside my comfort zone. I allways play it solo with one player soldier and a bunch of NPS and Squaddies, depending on scenario.  LOTR:LCG of course came up again, as it does allways. Still my number one favorite game of all time (well, ok, number two of games of all time, but number one of those I actually get to play ;) ). Currently mostly playing a Treebeard/Merry/Pippin deck, rofl-stomping bad guys in the Against the Shadow cycle.  I played Space Hulk: Death Angels again after a longer absence and it still is fun to play. I like the quick setup and teardown. I don't allways like it's randomness. I definitely don't like the broodlords.  Nations the Dice Game and Paperback got played at our weekly game meeting. Paperback hits the table quite often other times, too, it's my wifes favorite game. I am still astonished how hard Nations TDG is for the people at our weekly meet, though. I mean, it's a light dice chucker and they make a 1.5 hour affair out of it ;)  And I got Race for the Galaxy out with the gathering storm robot to get some solo galaxy racing in. Still a really nice and variable AI to lose agains. I still think that one day I might win against it ...  Regarding favorite non-played game: that would be my number one game of all time, Magic the Gatering. Sadly I am one of those filthy casuals, so FNM isn't really to my likening, due to them allmost exclusively playing standard or draft on current sets. Following the meta to know what cards are great in drafting isn't really my thing and rebuilding a deck once a year isn't, either. That leaves EDH, but the EDH scene at the LGS is small and not really that welcoming to new players, mostly it's guys that play together for a long time already, newcomers quickly feel left out.  And collection size (a bit over 60 games with tons of expansions for some of them like LOTR:LCG) - is there any other way than expansion? Must be some kind of physical law of entropy or something other fundamental."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bboomslang,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"Seasons - This one has been on the trade block, and a friend of mine wanted to try it out again. So we did. It's firmly placed it's position in the trade block. I'm not a huge fan of the card play in it. I love how the resources are gained and stored. I love the dice drafting mechanic. But what the cards themselves do - the meat of the game - is lackluster for me.  Colt Express - Did the two player game of this. I've been skeptical of any enjoyment I would get out of this game. Sure, it won the big award, but it seemed too random and chaotic to be fun. So was it fun? Yes. It was. The two player variant is very well done, but I'm not now anxious to try this game with 5 players.     What's your favorite game you never get to play?   All of my favorite games. They tend to be heavier than the bulk of my friends care to play. This includes, but not limited to Terra Mystica, Bora Bora, Dungeon Lords, Ora et Labora.   How large is your collection, and are you in the process of reducing or expanding it?   I have 127 games, and it's in a very fluid state right now with a bunch going out, after having a bunch that came in. But I think the input is a bit higher than the output. I'll need to slowdown, as I counted the number of unplayed games, and realized I should probably play some of the ones I've bought. I've just been burned by the ""I'll buy it later"", and when later came the game was OOP."
boardgames,3dxyfv,OutlierJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:48 2015 UTC,I've played Colt Express with 5 players.  I haven't played with 2 so I can't compare but I thought the game was quite fun with 5.  I would easily recommend anyone try the game based solely on my single play of it.
boardgames,3dxyfv,kinadian1980,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"That's really ashame that TM, Dungeon Lords, and Ora et Labora are on that list. Especially TM since once you get the hang of it I feel like it's really not too heavy."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wish I had more available friends that liked the games I do too.  It's like pulling teeth when I say ""Hey, let's play this game. (Kanban)"" but Colt Express? Instantly on the table. I'm happy I just get to play the games, but I do get an itch I need scratched that games like Colt Express, ONUW, Splendor and Black Fleet can't reach."
boardgames,3dxyfv,OutlierJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. I love playing lighter to mid weight games and I know getting a heavy game out can be tough when it has a long set up and everyone has to remind themselves of the rules again, but it's worth it in the end. Those types of games just give me a feeling when they're over and while playing that other games don't. I feel like I've accomplished something great looking at my empire in TM or my dungeon in DL."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:40 2015 UTC,Totally with you on Seasons. If only the actions of the cards were more interesting (i.e. the game needs more mechanical complexity...).
boardgames,3dxyfv,ook_the_bla,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"What frustrated me with Seasons this last time playing it is that there is a really great, unique mechanic in the game with the dice drafting - and it's so under utilized. I would be interested in a game that really expands that aspect of it."
boardgames,3dxyfv,OutlierJoe,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"I played a lot of games this week, as it was a particularly large group for my weekly board game group. However, the real winner this week was Xia Legends of a Drift System. I picked up a sellsword kickstarter exclusive edition for a good price on the BGG marketplace and received it last week, got two plays in this week and oh boy I am hooked. You definitely spend the first few times just going ""Look at the awesome quality of everything!"" Look!"" and even when I've lost or blown up I seriously enjoy myself. Played a quick game at first with three, then a larger game with five. Three to six hours seems average. Might be an every once in a while play, and I may turn into the ""Hey, want to come to my place and play Xia"" guy, but that's ok if it works everyone once in a while."
boardgames,3dxyfv,SteoanK,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"Nine hours of Twilight Imperium 3. It was my first play and I had a great time. Most of us that played was out first time so we spent more time than it would probably normally take. It took about an hour or so to go through rules. OMG the rule!! While simple there is a lot going on.  We made it through six rounds in the nine hours. Mr. Tech Race ruled the board of course. I'm going to try to convince the group that the next time we play we simply take that race out of the pool. It's easily countered but all seven of us posted really conservatively and it made for an easy victory for him. I think once we play more the race will be easier to deal with but until then I think it shouldn't be available to play. Maybe I'm being whiny and sour because I was across the board and there was no way for me to deal with him at the beginning of the game.  Overall, I enjoyed it a lot but I won't play it often due to the length."
boardgames,3dxyfv,scotty3281,3,Mon Jul 20 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"I played more games than usual this week:  Biblios - Played and lost twice against my older daughter. I like the push-your-luck aspect of the initial draft phase.   Survive! - With my buddy's daughter and friend. Got ganged up on big time. Loved it.  Villa Paletti - Great dexterity game. I need a new copy since I lost the hook you use to pull pieces out.  Hey, That's My Fish! - Pain to set up, but a fun little abstract game.  Splendor -  Lost by a hair when the player before me took the card that would've scored me a noble for the win.  Game I never get to play: I hardly ever get to play any of my Stefan Feld games.  Collection size: I have 142 games according to BGG. I've decided my cut-off is 200. EDIT: 250."
boardgames,3dxyfv,thingamarob,5,Mon Jul 20 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"Got a few things in this week: Viceroy - Guy at a meetup had it and I gave it a whirl. I definitely see why the game was so hyped - it's really good.  The variable character card powers and pyramid mechanic make it a bit of a puzzle to figure out what direction you want to go it.  We did agree to not play with the Viceroys themselves, as they seemed to be incredibly broken (and based on my buddy's experience, they doubled the scores of the game more or less). Dead of Winter x2 - The first game I played was with some friends, and we couldn't come to a consensus to exile, and lost pretty hard.  The second game, I was the betrayer, and on what would be the second to last turn, I managed to kill off one of my characters with a die roll (my objective was to have one survivor with food, fuel, and medicine from off site locations and be armed) to drop morale to 2, sabotage the crisis, which added 12 zombie to the colony, triggering the bad condition of a previously drawn crossroads card, which was lose one morale. The last turn started, and I was first player. I promptly shot the poor guy who was going second once, and he had a frostbite wound, which meant at the start of his turn, his character died, and morale went to zero. It was the first time in a loooooong time that I'd won, and never as the betrayer.  Extremely satisfying, though I don't think any of those people will play a hidden role game with me again. Russian Railroads - Something I've been meaning to try.  Good, freaking, lord is there a lot going on in this game. The fella who taught it did an excellent job and gave us an idea of what turn benchmarks should be points wise, and I really loved how much was going on. In the end, I wasn't able to pull close enough to even threaten first, but we still finished about 390-340 (me) 330-290. Definitely satisfying, even in the loss. Splendor x2 - People never get tired of the game it seems, and I really don't either.  I tend to fiddle about and look at different ways to win each time.    My favorite game I really never get to play is probably Core Worlds because the people that like to play it really like to play it, but I have a hard time mustering them.    My collection sits at exactly 100 games (discounting the few copies of various Monopoly I still have from my childhood) and I try to keep it at that, trading/selling stuff I don't play much and making sure I have stuff that my friends and I are playing, and enjoying.  I might offload a chunk of my small-box games that I'm not playing as much and some of the solo stuff, as I've played them out."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bakuryu69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"Core Worlds is not my favorite game, but it's easily top 20 for me.  I'd totally play it with you if we were geographically able."
boardgames,3dxyfv,7silence,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's really good, but it's also somewhere in my top 25, I just don't get to play it much."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bakuryu69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:11 2015 UTC,I've heard reports that Core Worlds really needs the first expansion to play well and that the game can kind of drag on. Are either of these true or just hearsay by people that believe Dominion is the one true deckbuilding game?
boardgames,3dxyfv,Norsbane,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I liked the base game just fine.  I can see it getting kind of stale with a lot of plays, but the expansion does help bring a lot of harmony to it. I would also note that Core Worlds is a deck builder, but it is a far more Euro-y one than dominion.  You are adding cards to a deck, but you are also deploying them, managing your energy so that you can deploy them, and using energy to buy cards.  When you play the game, think of it more like a Euro than a traditional deck builder.  Most deck builders can run in under an hour (or much faster if everyone has the rules down).  Core Worlds always takes a bit longer because there is a bit more thought involved."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bakuryu69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"Epic Dead of Winter game. No one ever seems to die when I'm the Betrayer, sadly enough haha. It seems like you played your cards right though and got the fortuitous rolls when you needed them. It's making me rethink how I play the Betrayer and honestly it sounds great.  I'm sure your friends will deal with it, too, haha."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the betrayer is really bound by their objective and morale - so you have to really wait for a few other players to have bad rolls or crossroads or a crisis to go the wrong way before you spring the trap. I managed to convince everyone the turn prior to the add zombies turn that the crisis wasn't worth completing and it was better to take the morale hit since we needed food.  It was a logical argument, but it also ensured that we'd have morale low enough to really spring my trap on the next turn. Being the traitor and having the first turn of the last round is also insanely powerful.  If anyone else would have gone first I would have had to talk my way out of being called the traitor and then successfully sabotaged the mission again."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bakuryu69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely agreed. If the Betrayer either goes very last or goes first in the last round, there's an advantage. Plus, tanking a crisis is always an option and can be logically talked through."
boardgames,3dxyfv,LouieSTFU,9,Mon Jul 20 16:25:32 2015 UTC,"Good week this week!  Friday at work, I played 4 games of Red7, 2 games of For Sale and one game of Polarity, which I had recently picked up in an auction that my FLGS, Game Nite ran.   I was recently invited to give a talk about boardgames to the St Louis chapter of MENSA, so Saturday I did just that, giving a brief history of Social Deduction Games. We then went on to play some games of The Resistance: Avalon. I'd asked /u/thoumyvision and /u/charlestheel to assist in facilitating the games. We had about 20 people total, but some people wanted to just watch and others weren't hanging around for very long.  So with those remaining, we split into two games of 7.  Both games just used Merlin/Assassin with no additional roles.  Nothing particularly eventful in the first games, though /u/charlestheel was first leader in the game he and I were in, he picked me to go with him, the team was approved, and the quest failed... so of course we were accusing each other the rest of the game. /u/thoumyvision was running the other game, so I'll let him speak to how that went.  Once both of those games were done, there were some people who wanted to play again, and had time to, so we merged together to form a group of 8.  Now, this was a much more interesting game. The first mission had 3 people on it, including /u/charlestheel, and it was a success. No big surprise. The second mission was those three, plus one more person, and it had two failures. This team had 2 people new to the game, and the addition over Mission 1 was /u/thoumyvision.  /u/charlestheel had chosen that team, and protested that obviously he wouldn't pick two spies to go on it if he were a spy, especially with new people in the game, and even if he were a spy he would surely have controlled it by not putting a fail in himself.  It was also clear that M1 had at least one spy on it, and /u/thoumyvision was claiming that as he was surely a good guy, that M1 actually had two spies on it.   We had some strong opinions as to who were the two spies in M2, so M3 formed with no-one from M1 on it, but did include /u/thoumyvision. It also failed.  B, one of the new people, was not on either M2 or M3, so from /u/thoumyvision's point of view, she was in the clear. We agreed that if /u/thoumyvision was good, so was B.   M4 came around, requiring two fails. /u/charlestheel put together a team. /u/thoumyvision noted that he could have put together a team that was objectively guaranteed to have at most 1 spy on it, but had failed to do so. /u/charlestheel noted that this was true, but he had a particular reason for doing it.  The team was me, /u/charlestheel, /u/thoumyvision, S1 (who has played the game quite a bit) and the aforementioned B. We pointed out how in general, given the spies already had 2 fails, if this team had 2 or more spies on it then they should fail it and win the game, but that if there were only one spy on it, it would be in the spy's interest to play success, in order to remain hidden.  The results were in... one fail!  Immediate suspicion went to B, as the only newbie in the game. But, given that if /u/thoumyvision were good, so was B, then logically, if B were evil, then so was /u/thoumyvision.  In which case, why hadn't they both failed it to win the game?  The last round was tense; confusion reigned. K (one of the people on M1 and M2) was strongly suspected of being a spy - he'd voted to approve a team in M3 that because of the two fails in M2, logically had to have at least one spy on it if K himself were innocent. /u/thoumyvision and S1 talked a lot and eventually picked a team of the two of them, me, J (who had been on M1/M2), and B, leaving K, S2 and /u/charlestheel off the team.  S1 was not too sure about the team and wanted to make some changes. /u/thoumyvision said that solidified his trust in S1, because if he were a spy, he'd have no cause to try and change this, as he was on the team himself. I said that yes, that's exactly what he might do (meaning in general, rather than necessarily in this specific instance).  That comment caused /u/thoumyvision to remove me from the team, and add /u/charlestheel; Then because if /u/charlestheel were clean, J must have been the other spy on M2 along with K, J was removed and S2 was added.  The mission went ahead... and it had two fails.  K, S2 and /u/charlestheel were the spies!  Indeed, /u/charlestheel had thrown the second fail in M2, and had deliberately thrown the fail in M4 in order to sow dissent and confusion into the mix. It worked well.  A lot of fun was had by all!    Favourite game I never / seldom get to play is Advanced Civilization, but a friend has just invited several people for an all day game next month - I'm currently hoping to arrange to be able to go to that.  My collection is probably around 250 or so at the moment. My BGG record keeping is a little out of date, so I should do an audit and correct it. Though I've picked up some new games recently, I've also sold several, and plan to sell a few more before too long.  I think my current aim is to reduce :)"
boardgames,3dxyfv,timotab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"I read /u/charlestheel's write-up first, but yours was equally excellent.  Have you been involved with the MENSA group for long?  What is their exposure to boardgames typically?  For example, is the St. Luis chapter generally familiar with games like the MENSA Select?"
boardgames,3dxyfv,timotab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"Did /u/charlestheel post his write up elsewhere (BGG maybe)? He doesn't appear to have posted it here, so a link would be nice.  I'm not involved with MENSA at all. One of my colleagues (who I played the Friday lunchtimes games with) made the connection that I'm the organizer of the St Louis (note, it has an ""o"" in it) Boardgame meetup group, and she then invited me to present. They've done some boardgame events before, and I have no knowledge of their involvement with MENSA select."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Wisecow,4,Mon Jul 20 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: My wife and I had a ""date night"" this week in which, for part of it, we played Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. She's not a big gamer... okay, she's not a gamer at all. But we took it to a local vineyard and later a cafe and I convinced her on the lack (no) of fiddly bits. Took us about 2 1/2 hours for the first case, but my wife insisted on being extra thorough with the newspaper. Regardless, we still didn't score very well, but at least ended up in the positive. The experience itself, though, was great. Totally felt like we were Victorian Era detectives as were referencing the map, writing down clues in our notebook, and chasing down leads. The wife even said ""it was fun"", which I think is the highest praise she has ever given a game before. I've never actually really seen her invest herself into a game like she did this one. We're both excited to play it again.  And at my weekly boardgame meetup we played Kemet (5p) and Good Cop Bad Cop (6p). I also snuck in a quick game of Hive.  Questions:   What's your favorite game you never get to play?   I don't have a favorite that I never get to play. My favorite game is Kemet and my group likes it quite a bit. I do wish I could play Roll of the Galaxy more than I do though. I only get in the occasional play.   How large is your collection, and are you in the process of reducing or expanding it?   According to BGG my collection is 64 games, that being said 12 of those aren't 'modern games', but are thinks like your standard Parker Bros/Milton Bradley type stuff. So... 52 modern games. I'm still expanding my collection, but more targeted now. Most games I'm buying now I'm considering the different moods I might be in. I have some good light to mid-heavy euros, but no heavy brain burning euros, so I'd like to get one of those. I also want to get something light-mid weight that's less about mechanics and more about group interaction so I'm considering something like Cosmic Encounter or Betrayal at House on the Hill"

I liked the board is different at each game.  Welcome to the dungeon Sometimes, it's not who's gonna be the chicken, but how can you screw up your opponents and force them to fight to death.  Memoir' 44 We played at four players, D-Day landings. It was Juno and Gold beach. I was on the Axis side, and man, unless we can rush all in and get lucky in reinforcements, we stood no chance me and my partner. Plus the game is pretty long, with two newbies (me and my opponents on Juno beach). Interesting, but not my cup of tea. Plus I would like something more symetrical. It lasts more than 3 hours.  Letters of Whitechapel. I was Jack the Ripper, and I faced 3 other guys. Boy this game can be difficult for the police side since you can relay on deduction, coordination, and luck. My opponents only relied almost on luck. Their deduction were wrong, each of them went to a complete different direction, and they got almost no clue. They admitted they played like a bunch of headless chickens, and I did not had a hard time to lose them in the londonian fog. I did not tried to be devious, I was pretty straightforward when moving.  I'm getting a hard time to play Imperial Settlers. Not because my group does not want to play it, but there is always something else to play. Too much games (old and new) to try. I know it will come soon... ish.  I have around 70 games in my collections, and I'm in the process to shrink it and get rid of a couple of games."

Our group played the 4th game of Risk Legacy; we have opened a few new envelopes which is going to be interesting the next time we play. I'm not sold on the game yet because I'm not ruthless enough to just go all guns blazing and destroy everyone. I think I need to study some tactics.   Also played Betrayal on House on the Hill. The haunting happened fairly early on and I was killed in a risky Hail Mary move to try and give my team the edge.   All in all a great week.

However, I need more plays of this to analyze the characters better.  They seem so overpowered at first glance and I'm curious to see how I feel about them on further plays.  Everyone had a good time.  Broom Service - also played at meetup.  No one wanted to play this until the very end.  Broom Service over Forbidden Stars, Dark Moon, Colosseum, etc?  No one wanted to play.  Finally got a group going and they don't know what to expect.  I'm cowardly? I'm a Forest Witch?  Lots of awkwardness.  That lasted 5 minutes.  By the end of the game we were laughing and having a great time.  Most fun I've had in a long time.  I'm really glad I got his game.  Cacao - Enjoyed the game.  Just fun relaxing game I feel I'll play every so often with the wife.    Arena of the Planeswalker x 2 - Played this twice with my brother.  We used to play a lot of Heroscape and Magic way back in the day and the game managed to scratch both itches for a brief moment.  Quick games and the five Planeswalkers means I'll get some decent play out of the game before hoping for expansions.    Last Night on Earth x3 - Never played this before.  Was a nice Zombie game I could see myself play on occasion.  Lots of luck in this one but didn't seem to bother me.  Enjoyed it for what it is.  Soundtrack was horrible though.  Had to find a different one on the net.  A Touch of Evil - See Last Night on Earth.  Enjoyed it for what it is.  Boss Monsters 2 - Improved Boss Monsters a bit.  Still a decent filler whose nostalgia theme still makes me happy.  Caffeine Rush - Not my cup of tea.  Real time games are fun but very group reliant.  Q1 - The epics are the ones that see less playtime as well as player specific ones.  Game of Thrones, Chaos in the Old World, etc.  Q2 - For size see COMC.  I guess it's currently still expanding though I may give the hedges some trimming as the Kickstarter stuff arrives."

boardgames,3dxyfv,ModernTenshi04,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"I played:  Hot Tin Roof - A buddy at the FLGS I hang out at had been wanting to play for a while, so we and two others played a quick game. Everyone liked it well enough, and some of them may add it to their collections because it's a simple game to setup and play, which is the main reason I bought it.  Cosmic Encounter - First time a buddy was playing his copy, first time two others had played the game as well. I've only managed a bout 7 to 10 times myself, same as the fifth player in the game. Guy who owns the game chose the Vulch power, and ended up getting the Clone flare as well, so he was able to take discarded artifacts other players played, in addition to not having to discard his own when played, which led to quite a bit of dickery as he ended up with nearly every artifact in the game. Part of me thinks we were playing them wrong, but in the end we bent the rules (without knowing until later) to end the game. Ended up with a three way win that way as well.  Viceroy - Guy who brought in Cosmic Encounter also got his copy of Viceroy from the Kickstarter, so we broke it out as the final game of the night. Once we got the hang of it the game played pretty quickly. I won by blitzing victory point cards and beating the second place player by two points. Held on to a General card with 12 points if he's on tier 4 since my opening hand. The guy whos copy we played was kicking himself in the ass for not buying the playmat, which another person at the table had and we used to play. Overall a fun game and something I""ll look to add in the future.  What game is my favorite that I never get to play? Probably Mansions of Madness. I really like the theme and the 4 on 1 aspect of the gameplay, but the large amount of setup required plus the long playtime kind of kills it for lots of people. My copy is organized pretty well, but I may revamp it to cut down on setup time even more.  My collection is modest, only at 24 games not counting expansions (32 if you do). I have Coup: Rebellion G54, Deck Building: The Deck Building Game, Mare Nostrum, and Apotheca all incoming from Kickstarter, and I plan to back the Keyflower is Awesome campaign for the base game and both expansions.  I'm in the process of expanding it, but most likely more slowly over the next few years. I'm getting married in September so I won't be able to just buy games all the time without consulting someone first (for big ones anyway), plus we're trying to pay off as much of our student loan debt as possible while also saving to get into a house within the next two years. Might also try for a family within that timeframe as well. With what I bought at Origins plus Kickstarter so far, that's 9 games plus five expansions this year. Sort of a last hurrah of spending freedom for me I suppose, but it's all good as I'll be married to the woman I love. :)"

Also played Forbidden Stars but after about 2 rounds I actually understood the game and also realised it was far too late to win. The combat you aren't involved in blows."
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:09 2015 UTC,This is why when I play Tzolkin I kind of have a wing it and see what happens strategy. There's too many options to try to figure out which one is best.   I've read that before about Forbidden Stars so I think if I do end up getting it I'll be sticking to 2 player only.
boardgames,3dxyfv,bodhibell02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, the downtime for combat can be slow and I mostly play 2 player. But honestly, I like watching combat and looking at what cards the person next to me picks. It is exciting! But it is an incredibly solid 2 player game. I do still love it 4, but gotta play more 4 player to see if it gets better as people learn the game."
boardgames,3dxyfv,bleuchz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:16 2015 UTC,Got a really good play of Powergrid in. It's probably my favorite game I don't own. Came down to the wire. I hate mathy games and dislike auctions but somehow this game just.... Sings.   Played a bunch of spyfall via the meteor website which was fun. I almost like it better than the card game as its a bit easier to see the available locations as the spy.   Also played Splendor and King of Tokyo as fillers but nothing special there. I enjoy KoT a lot more with power up.   Favorite game i never get to play Tough to answer for that very reason. I have been trying to get Kemet to the table recently so it's either that or Battlecon.   How large is my collection? I think I'm currently sitting at 57. I would like to get it down to around 40. I don't really have a good way to cull. Every now and then if someone likes a game in my collection I'm not very big on I'll give it away but i really need a better system.

boardgames,3dxyfv,raouldukehst,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"7/13  Targi and Quantum with my wife. I think she just tolerates Targi because of how much I love it, but she really really likes Quantum (in fact we first played it on the 11th and she actaully asked to play again!!).  7/14  Resistance at lunch with 5 players, I think we might be over it as a 5 player game, but it's still a favorite 6+. I also played Star Trek Deck Building Game: The Next Generation with my wife, which wasn't nearly as confusing as the internet made it out to be. She loved that game too so I have a lot of space fairing in my future! I ended the night playing a game of Stone Age and Tokaido online and getting beat like always...  7/15  Another online game of Stone Age - got second this time!  7/16  Two games of HeroClix because there was a bye and I'm the judge. Had a good time even though I couldn't roll to save my life in the first game!  7/18  Two new games! Deus got off to a rough start, but I think we got it in the end (the cards make it seem very luck dependent...) and Magnate was the surprise hit of the day. I picked it up on a whim at a comic store (the box was cool...), and we loved it!   I have too many of those... at the moment I'd say Trajan since I really want to play it. Too big - I think I'm at 146 non expansion games with a ton more in the mail... I'm trying to reduce it but not doing great..."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Norsbane,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"Formula D - 3 plays 3 players. My friends really seem to love racing games so I guess I'll be getting more of those as time goes on. I'm interested to see how the game plays with more players and the advanced rules-with just 3 players, you always have space to overtake everyone. Once you add even just one more player you finally have the chance that you might have to jockey for position more. Hanabi - 1 play, 2 players. I introduced this to one of my brothers over the weekend. He is just getting into gaming and was blown away by this game. Love Letter - 1 play, 3 players. Another game I introduced to my family. It was fun and they got it pretty quickly. The usual hijinks of turn 1 guard sniping happened and everyone had a good time.   I never get to play Tokaido and it makes me sad. I like how quickly and smoothly the game plays but my playgroup really isn't into the east-asian themed games.  My collection currently stands at 53 games. It is still expanding, but I am slowing down the rate of expansion. After buying the SW: Designer Ed I tried to stop myself from getting any more games for a few months because that put me way over my ""fun budget"". I got suckered into getting another haul though when my FLGS had a buy 1 get 2 free on clearance games. If I can behave, the collection will stand at 53 games until November, after which point I will continue to fill out my X-wing collection."
boardgames,3dxyfv,hoosierstateofmind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"I bought, played and taught Hanabi to my wife this weekend. She's not much of a gamer. Enjoys card games like euchre and the such but hasn't played much of anything else. I thought Hanabi would be a good starter from what I saw on youtube. It was difficult mindset to establish but once we got the hang of it we loved it. We ""cheated"" quite a bit for our first time, but it still provided us with lots of good laughs. Communication error and shuffling hands to try and organize things was a lot of fun. I could see it becoming a staple for us in evenings when we're just sitting around watching TV. Love letter just doesn't have enough to keep our interest as a 2p game."
boardgames,3dxyfv,cromusz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"Been playing more and more games with my wife lately so we've added a few to the library. Early in the week, played a lot of 2 player games with her and myself. Friday night we had a game night at my friend's house with 6 people (splitting into 3s for some games). Sunday we went to her parents house and played a couple more games.   Love Letter - Several 2 player games and several 4 player games. The two player game was brutal as we baron'd each other pretty quickly. With four players, it made it a bit more exciting and we had a great time. Coup - A couple 2 player games and a few 6 player games. I have a lot of work to do in the deception games. The different abilities really come in handy when trying to gain coins for assassinations or coup (what's the plural? coups?). I really enjoyed the game and look forward to trying it out more in the future. Roll for It - A few games with 2p and a couple games with 4p. We were somewhat surprised with how small the dice were in this game. It makes sense though; it's easier to travel with smaller dice. It was a ton of fun to play a game so heavy on the luck factor after spending a lot of time with more strategy/tactics styles of games. I really enjoy rolling dice and this game was a hit with my wife and her parents. Takenoko - One play with 4 players on Sunday. My wife played this with her group of 3. This game has a ton of luck with a hearty dose of strategy built in. It's really interesting seeing what your opponents are focusing on and how that affects your own strategy. I was really close to winning but my wife surmised that I was trying to get 4 stacks of 3 green. She stomped my dreams quickly. Dominion - 2 games with 3 players. This was my first time playing and I really enjoyed it. I still don't have an understanding of good strategy, but it was a lot of fun. Marvel Legendary - A few 2p games and one 5p game. Fun as always. Still only have the base set, but we haven't completed all of the schemes or fought all of the masterminds. Five Tribes - Just purchased this and have one game under my belt with two players. Setup takes a bit, but the game is rather simple in goals. I still have a lot of strategy to learn here. We played with 2 players and I look forward to playing with more. Zombie Dice - It had been a while since I've played this last, but we needed a good starter game for game night. It's so easy for everyone to get into and the push-your-luck is exciting.  Ticket to Ride - It's hard not to like TtR. The art, components, and theme are all really great. We played with five people and it was a lot of fun fighting over territories for our tracks. If only they didn't swarm LA, I could have won! Splendor - After playing the knockoff android app for a week with my wife, I decided to finally buy the actual game. I was shocked at the quality of the chips and they really added to the game. I haven't won a game of this yet. We've played it 2p and 4p so far. My strategy is pretty week and I'll need to work on that.   2p Games with the Wife: Legendary, Love Letter, Coup, Roll for It, Splendor, Five Tribes, Takenoko  Friday: Zombie Dice, Love Letter, Coup, Dominion/Takenoko, Marvel Legendary  Sunday: Roll for it, Love Letter, Takenoko, Splendor  Questions:    What's your favorite game you never get to play?   Connect 4. I rarely get to play it since I'm pretty good at it. Luckily, I get to play most of my favorites with my wife. She doesn't really turn down any of the games I suggest.   How large is your collection, and are you in the process of reducing or expanding it?   It's rather small. I thing I have about ~60 games on BGG, but a lot of those don't get played. I'd like to purge some of the lesser played ones and pick up some newer ones as money allows.  Happy gaming everyone!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,lVipples,2,Mon Jul 20 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"I've played TTR with 4, but never 5.  I can imagine that being pretty hectic!  Takenoko definitely has a fair amount of luck, but the light theme really helps with that.  I think you have the most unexpected 'favorite game you never get to play' game in this thread!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,cscottaxp,3,Tue Jul 21 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"I hosted my bi-monthly board game day this past weekend, so we got a few games to the table.    Sheriff of Nottingham - This is my friend's copy (I've get to grab my own, though I do intend to, so I can throw my Tabletop Day 2015 promo card in to it)  I've loved this game every time I've played it and my fiancee got to try it for the first time and she enjoyed it as well.  And I won!  Yay!    Tokaido - This game makes it to the table more than any other game I own.  It's simple, relaxing, and fun.  I got a few friends started on this by teaching the rules and then I made my way over to where I wanted to be:    Shadows Over Camelot - Of all my modern board games, this is the one I've owned the longest.  I've had this for close to 6 years, but couldn't get people to play it because it looked too complicated for them.  Finally, I got people to play a few months ago and now everyone LOVES it!  It's, hands-down, my favorite co-op.  One friend went out and bought it immediately after his first time playing it.  And we were SO CLOSE to winning, but then, the only person in the group who hadn't played before turned out to be the traitor.  And he caught on quickly and played it perfectly.  He put us right near a win before he started accusing everyone else of being a traitor, flipping 2 swords from white to black before we had a chance to call him out.  The only way we could lose was by being flooded with siege engines.  So, that's exactly what he did.    Dixit - This is a great party game for lighter players.  This was played twice in a row this weekend and everyone had a great time.    Red Dragon Inn - If you don't have this game in your collection, you should add it to your list.  Everyone loves this game.  It's about drinking and gambling without actually having to drink or gamble.  What's not to love?  It's just goofy enough to be a good time without being dumb or confusing.    Guillotine - This was one of the first games I bought when I started my actual collection.  I was looking for games to play with just myself and my fiancee and we both really enjoy it for its simplicity.  We ended up playing with 5 people this weekend and it still works as a great filler game.  Perfect for any collection.    I think that's everything that hit the table this week.    My favorite game I never get to play?  I don't really have one of those.  I've been pretty proficient at getting all my favorites to the table.  I love Smallworld but haven't gotten that to the table in several months, but that's just because we've been trying to mix things up.  It'll come back, I think.    And my collection is somewhere around 40 games now.  I'm sitting at a steady number right now, but it's still slowly expanding.  I have my amazon wishlist set up with all the games I would LIKE to buy, but I'm in no rush to add them to my collection.  I have other things I'm saving up for and this collection is a perfect size and diversity for myself and my friends to not get bored for a bit.    Thanks for reading!"
boardgames,3dxyfv,blueballoon,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"Resistance: Avalon - four plays, eight players. I brought it to our monthly board game nights and everyone loved it! Without the moderator/DM guiding everything in the beginning, it was a little difficult to memorize all the lines. But it was definitely a lot of fun and I can't wait until our next game night to pull this one out again.  Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small - three plays, two players. Messed up the first time when we realized you have to spend resources to build fences, and that they're not free. But I had a lot of fun shoving all the sheep and cows into a small space. After third time, it felt like it was becoming a little stale since our first couple turns remained same throughout the different plays.  And last weekend, we played Forbidden Desert and Hanabi with my SO's friends. Lost twice and won once in FD. Definitely another game I'd love to try again with different people. But Hanabi remains my favorite casual game. It's so easy to explain to new players and we usually get two or three plays in before moving onto another game."
boardgames,3dxyfv,coryosborn,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"I got a lot of gaming in this weekend and more tonight!  Monday 7/13   Pensari fun puzzle, but not a great group game. Dice Town Played 5 players.  There was some closer scoring than expected.  My gold hoarding only netted me second place. Istanbul 5 players, random setup. Our only first-time player found the most efficient route and crushed us getting to 5 gems before anyone else had 3.   Saturday 7/18   Compounded We had a board game newbie in the mix, but he picked up on it.  We were playing 4 players, with myself and another tying at 49 points, while lab fires burned the other two and they scored in the 30s. Tsuro 4 players and 3 quick rounds to close the night.  We had more.  One round of a perfect tie surviving and two rounds were everyone died.   Sunday 7/19  We had a nice long afternoon/evening of 6 player gaming.   Euphoria My engine couldn't get running to sacrifice workers for extra stars and I got shut out of too many market constructions to make a difference.  A solid last place.  Scoville  With 6 players, the recipes were exhausted quickly.  We were playing the final round when the afternoon market cards came out.  The only player to get ghost peppers early was the winner at 59 points.  My 55 were good for second, but everyone but one player was above 50 points. Libertalia  A nice closer to the day.  I took the early lead with a complete treasure map on the first voyage, but was  surpassed to finish third.  The eventual winner was somehow able to score 45 doubloons on the last voyage.   Favorite game I never get to play: Hmm, top 3 would be Eclipse, Keyflower, and Tzolk'in.  I'm usually introducing lighter games.  Collection Size: games: 73, games + expansions: 125.  Increasing.   EDIT: answered questions"
boardgames,3dxyfv,jerrybeansman,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Moved in with the lady last week and FINALLY got her to play some games!  We started with Ticket to Ride which she picked up on easily...well, at the end I found out she thought the white cards were for the gray spaces only (I assumed she understood when her first 4 train placements were on gray tracks).  We played Pandemic another night because she remembers it from her family and friends playing it. We lost with 2/4 cured but she still had fun so that's good.  Last night we had a REALLY close game of Lords of Waterdeep (like 175 to 170). I think might be her favorite of the bunch so far which is funny because she was initially turned off by the D&D theme. I also haven't played since the months after it came out and I really enjoyed the game, a lot more than I ever have actually. Forgot how simple and fun that game is. She got a kick out of reading all the D&D-titled cards and laughing at how she had no idea what anything was.  We might try Mice & Mystics this week. She got it for me for Valentine's Day but I haven't sat down and learned the rules yet. Gonna have to watch the Watch It Played vid a few more times."
boardgames,3dxyfv,scorcherdarkly,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"Mice and Mystics is pretty simple at it's core, but each adventure (and often each room) has its own special rules.  You have to pay close attention to those.  It's a pretty fun little game, though.  It's really just a simplified version of a D&D dungeon module with cute mice instead of elves and dwarves."
boardgames,3dxyfv,baddestdog,3,Mon Jul 20 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"Only got in one board game this week:   Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries: Played this with a girl on a date over the weekend. Quite a good game, makes for a fun date night, we're both Scandinavia (myself Swedish, her Norwegian) so it made for some fun banter teasing each other about our heritage while we played. The main issue is that we have NO idea where most of these cities are outside of the famous ones, plus the spellings are old spellings, not what you expect to see on an English map. I ended up winning, though that was partially due to skill, and partially because after about ten minutes into the game I decided to add another element and tied her naked to the chair with her hands tied together to make it more difficult. Much more fun that way. She could still reach and use her hands, but only with difficulty."
boardgames,3dxyfv,ook_the_bla,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"Thunderstone Advance - First play. Meh. Dominion with more theme, but three times the length, tons of deck bog-down, and too much re-counting (it makes SmashUp look reasonable). I won't play this again. Race for the Galaxy with Alien Artifacts expansion - I recently re-bought this. Wow. With one expansion, this game becomes about twice as enjoyable. Rocketed into my Top 10.  BattleCon - This is still one of my favorite games. I recently cracked open the fighters in Flight 2. While complex, there are a few I like a lot. I don't care for Ottavia, and I find Mikhail really difficult, but the rest were great. My next goal is to play with Arenas. Lewis & Clark - I continue to get a number of plays out of this. The initial shine of a ""10""-rating has worn off, but it's still very challenging and interesting to play. A game everyone should try twice. I think I'll tire of it after 15-20 plays, but it's worth having access to for those first dozen plays. Nothing quite like it. Friday - I have free time this summer, so I'm dipping my toes into solitaire gaming. Friday is a fun deck-builder, and so far I can't beat it on easy mode, which is a good thing. Not an awesome game, but a reasonably fun solo challenge.** Innovation - Played three player and solo (solo variant on BGG). Honestly, it's better solo than three player! Three is just too chaotic. I'll still play it because just going through the motions in Innovation is fun, but it doesn't feel like much of a strategy game with three. Solo is quite good and very challenging. Onirim - Another solo game. Points for being short and very easy to learn. Cool art. No need to own it, but fun to play here and there. Agricola - Still in my Top 3. I'm 70 plays in. Daytona 500 - Great, easy-to-play game. I am mystified as to why this game is not a smash-hit family game. Everyone I teach it to loves it, even if they aren't race game fans. It's so good. Why isn't it more popular? 7 Wonders - I'm sort of done with the base game. Need Leaders to make it fun. Deus - While interesting, it still underwhelms me. On the trade pile. Heartland - First play. Didn't find it interesting at all, honestly. Just flat. Not bad. Flat. Seasons - Everything about this game is fantastic except for the milquetoast powers on the cards. And since that is what all the other things are framed around, I don't like Seasons.  Star Realms - Of course. This game is great. App plays.   Favorite game I don't get to play: Magic: The Gathering - Like a previous poster, I am a casual Magic player, which means I have no one to play against. hahaha  Collections size and direction: I'm finally under 90 (including expansions), and I'm working hard to reduce it. 40 of my games never get played. I like them, and I don't want to sell them, but I also don't want to be so attached to unusable cardboard that I am unable to sell it."
boardgames,3dxyfv,v1pe,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"Not too much this last week.  Late Friday night plays:  Nations - I can't tell if I like Nations or not. So far I've kind of enjoyed the solo puzzle more than playing with others, but I don't know that I've actually gotten through all 4 ages with other players yet. We played through 3 the other night.   Innovation- was a fun one, the game can be quite random in the late game, but the card interactions are fun.   Wife and I sat down yesterday afternoon to learn Viceroy which came in the mail on Friday. We quite enjoyed it, my wife liked it more than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise. The game looks beautiful, I'm kind of wishing I grabbed the player mat but I will probably pick it up later if we end up playing it enough times.   Hard to pick one. The lengthy/heavy games are generally more difficult to get to the table, especially since I have a lot of lesser-experienced gamers in a couple of groups I play with. Terra Mystica, Eclipse, Tzolkin, Agricola all come to mind. I have around 120 games, plus a decent number of expansions. My collection is growing, but much more slowly now than it has in the past. I'm more picky about picking up games that either I really want, or games that I think will fit my play groups."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Tiburon898,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"Friday  Dark Moon BSG express.  I was infected and made a big mistake that probably cost us the game.  Captains of Industry we let one guy own the steel market, and not much research was bought, which was my main producing item.  Got Third.  Resistance: Avalon was Percival messed up on who Merlin was. We lost.  Saturday  Diamonds  4 player game.  Tied for last, but the scores were 36, 35, 34, 34 a close game, so can't get too upset about getting last.  Avalon again.  Played a couple game won one lost one.  Sunday  Straw I have had this game for a while, but never played.  Won it, so no rush to play it, but finally did, and a pretty fun light game.  Is it great no, but it can be a fun game to play before you start heavier games.  Girl won best way possible by finishing the last round with the straw.  Pandemic 4 players  I taught 3 people how to play.  So some how I got out the event cards but failed to put them in the deck.  We got crushed.  We played a second game with event cards this time.  We lost but were only one cure away from winning.  Cheaty Mages!  6 players.  I won by betting on the elf in the last round, and giving him a +10 on the last play.  I got lucky the judge did not allow support spells.   I don't have one.  I guess 7 wonders mostly because I usually get into heavier games, though I have played it a few times recently, but I probably went around 5 months without playing. I am in the 30's.  I will probably expand, but not for a while.  I think I am at a good spot."
boardgames,3dxyfv,conservative_marxist,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Vacation week meant that many games were played.  Boss Monster 2 player - 1st of many plays.  I got this game as a father's day present.  It's quick, fun and humorous.  Love Letter 4 player - many plays.  A game we can actually get our teenage kids to participate in.  We played it while waiting in restaurants and when it was raining outside.  One memorable game my wife was down 0 favors to everyone else's 2 and staged a comeback.  Spurs 4 player - The duel mechanic in the game is genius. My son ended up with about 10 wanted posters and won the game in Jesse James style.  Dungeon Roll 2 player.  I thought I had played this one out, but I am still enjoying it.  I managed to get to level 10 for the 1st time ever in this game.  King of the Elves 3 player - This is one of the oldest games in our collection. With tons of plays under our belt this game came down to who could play the most mean tricks on the other players. I won that prize, there's nothing better than putting down a late island or log to ruin everyones day!  Pathfinder ACG Skull and Shackles  2 player - We've kind of lost our momentum working through the scenario, so we made sure we got in a game to get back on track. We played the finale of the 3rd adventure (which we've failed twice before) and won right as the timer ran out of cards.  We also picked up some nice loot to add to our decks.  St. Petersburg/w market 2 player - I managed to picked up some great income cards from the market and aristocrat pile. I then got some nice buildings up and was able to win mostly with building vps.  Adventures of Marco Polo 2 player - I played the character with 2 extra trading posts and made it my mission to get them all out.  I fell 2 short which cost me the game, but I had a blast trying to get there.  Runebound - Sands of Al Kalim - 2 player - Another old game hitting the table.  My wife played a thief with a special that let her steal from the market. She managed to get a Djinn ally that helped her to a strong game.  I had a Rune shaman with a great equipment layout and was able to complete the 4 legendary quests first.  Concept 8 player -  Hilarious fun.  My team managed to get ""Luke I am your father"" Concepted out.    Telestrations 8 player - Another party game.  My gut was aching from laughing too hard by the time this one was over.  Cash and Guns 8 player - A fun time, but I have to admit that was my least favorite of the party games we got in.  Viceroy 2 player - 2 x plays.  My wife just got this in the mail after kickstarting it awhile ago.  It has superb artwork, but the component quality is a little flimsy.  The game itself is brilliant.  Definitely a paths to victory type game that made me think out a strategy and try and play to it based on the cards available.  Dnd 5e 6 Players - Definitely a fitting end to vacation.  I DM this particular game.  The party is currently in pursuit of a bandit leader trying to collect a bounty on his head.  They were a bit taken aback when he left an unarmed emissary behind to try and give a counter offer.  The party nearly took it, but some foul play lead them to chase off the emissary. Continuing their pursuit through the forest they are set apon by worg riders and then later some wolves.  Strange things are afoot."
boardgames,3dxyfv,zfrit,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"7 Wonders x2, 6p. I just love this game - thinking I should get some of the expansions.  The Resistance: Avalon x2, 6p. Finally cracked this game open, had it since Christmas and never got around to playing it.  I really enjoyed it, more so than the normal Resistance, which I also have.  One Night Ultimate Werewolf x a bunch, 6p. Always love this. I was also the Troublemaker more often than not, which was just so exciting for me as I got to mess with everyone.  Saboteur x2, 6p. Also love this game, I think this one is my most played of the year so far along with One Night Ultimate Werewolf (they are so small, quick to play and quick to teach, and so accommodating for many people).   Takenoko x2, 2p. Finally got around to playing this one as well, which I have also had since Christmas.  Favourite game to play that I never get to play...hmm, usually my favourite games I play quite a bit.  I do love Terra Mystica and don't play it as often as I'd like.  I started off the year playing Dead of Winter a lot too, but that hasn't seen the table in a while, boo.  I have around 60-70 games in the collection.  I recently eased off from buying games, and made it a personal goal to play all the games in my collection before buying new ones (I had around 15 unplayed).  Now I'm down to 1 unplayed (Star Wars Imperial Assault), so looking forward to buying some more games soon."

In chronological order:  Forbidden Stars: I taught this game to another player and got completely roflstomped.  It was like turn 4 before I even inflicted a casualty.  Odd game and I'm not sure where I went wrong.  Concept: We didn't even play for points, just spent a few rounds putting out clues and guessing.  Such light-hearted fun, this one.  Patchwork: Continuing the trend of getting floored that evening, I taught this to another player and got something like -30 points.  I guess it was more ""how not to play Patchwork.""  Abyss: Family game night and I felt this one delivered.  Light enough to grasp easily, but still some decisions to be made.  Everyone knows about the amazing art already.  Ingenious: More family night fun.  This one has been a crowd favorite for a while.  I tried a more aggressive strategy that revolved around sealing off points and it worked very well.  Marvel Dice Masters:  We did a private casual draft of the new Age of Ultron set.  I went 2-1, good enough for 3rd of 8.  The new set seems solid.  DC Comics Deckbuilder:  The GF had picked up both the Teen Titans and Heroes Unite expansions, so we tried those out.  I scored more points (83) in TT than I have ever scored in DC Deckbuilder before... Super Boy has a ridiculous power.  Viceroy: This was me and the GF muddling through our first game.  We made a few mistakes, but I think we have a grasp on it.  I am on the fence.  It seemed pretty straightforward points salad, but it may grow on me as I grasp card interactions and strategies.   My favorite game I never get to play is also my favorite game and my answer to at least half these questions: Twilight Imperium III.  It's just too damn long and no one wants to devote a day to playing it. My collection is currently 149 games, with a great many expansions.  Ostensibly, I am trying to shrink it but between waffling on parting with games and impending GenCon releases, I think it will be expanding in the short term."

boardgames,3dxyfv,7silence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I love Forbidden Stars.  This game felt like an anomaly because the usually stout Ultramarines just got pushed around like they were Imperial Guard.  To me, FS is a tight wargame with some fairly unique combat mechanics.  The force-building and movement mechanics are simplified and easy.  The meat of the game is in anticipating your opponents' orders and (hopefully) out-guessing them or at least pre-empting their efforts.  Combat is different from most war games in that it's dice rolls first and then up to three rounds of card playing that modifies the core dice rolls.  There is a limit to the number of dice you can roll and the number of units a particular location can hold, so it promotes quick strikes with smaller forces over building up an overwhelming army.  Lots of reviews have gone into the mechanics of the game, so I would recommend them if you are still curious.  My summation is that the game wastes little time and effort in the ""boring"" aspects of logistics and troop movements and instead puts all the shine on combat and conquering.  If you are already a fan of the setting, just go buy it.  You won't be unhappy."

I was on the other end of that and it was my own fault. 2p game and it was round 3 when I accidentally screwed the pooch and left both victory condition tiles under guarded and that was the game. I can see sort of what I did wrong, but I'm not sure how I could have done it differently (due to inexperience, not luck of the die or anything)."
boardgames,3dxyfv,7silence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"I am always hesitant to cry ""Waaah, the dice hate me,"" but I had a few odd battles that were pretty evenly matched at the start and I just got blown completely off the planet without hurting my opponent at all.  It's never gone like that before, much less three or four times in one game."
boardgames,3dxyfv,BlueSapphyre,3,Mon Jul 20 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"Viceroy: It feels like Splendor+. It's light like Splendor, but slightly more complex math involved. Very good quality, and it was the easiest punch board ever. I love when pieces just fall out with little effort/no tearing.  Android: Netrunner: My gf was playing RP and I was playing Blackmail Val, and she scored 7 points behind a Lotus Field while I was digging for my Atman. I've found that the deck stalls if it doesn't  have Wyldside in the opening hand.  Star Wars LCG: I got out 2 Sleuth Scouts and easily destroyed 3 objectives to win, while Luke held the fort down. The Death Star was only at 6. I need to tweak the dark side deck to deal with sleuths.  Doomtown: Reloaded: I was playing MCC and my gf was playing Sloan. The Sloan gang eventually killed enough of my dudes to win. I've learned I need more cheatin' punishment, the solid shootout of the Fullhouse draw structure is so intense. Maybe I should import Tommy Harden, since my hands are usually legal, and wins the lowball often enough to afford the extra upkeep.     What's your favorite game you never get to play?   Agricola. I'm just so much better at the game than my gf (because I play far too much on my iPad) that she gets demolished every game.   How large is your collection, and are you in the process of reducing or expanding it?   Holding steady. If a new game comes in, an old game has to leave. Minor exceptions include new expansions for any of the LCGs/ECGs or Miniature games like X-Wing, Armada, and Imperial Assault."

boardgames,3dxyfv,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, there's a core card list to every game, so while the card pool seems immense, it's really not that big. It is surprising when someone plays a card not used often and it catches you off guard, like I played a game the other day and someone played Sneakdoor Beta on me. I haven't seen that used since post-Spin cycle because HQ accesses are the worst value, but it got him an early lead until I could ICE archives. So I don't have an issue with it.  However, because my gf doesn't play as often as I, she can sometimes get games confused when she's thinking of a card.  ""Oh, what was that card that did [stuff] that you played last time?""  ""That was in [game] and not in this one."""

boardgames,3dxyfv,eviljelloman,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"This was a fun week with a couple of my favorite games getting to the table.  Dead of Winter - Four player game where we had a betrayer who cost us the win with the rounds running out, but couldn't drop morale enough to get the win.  Really fun game and I'm glad to be getting it to the table again after a long dry spell where people were fixated on new hotness (cough, Alchemists, cough)  Roll for the Galaxy - with a prototype of the new Ambition expansion!!!.  I destroyed everyone in a produce/consume strategy in this play with the upcoming expansion.  The expansion is AWESOME.  It gives you even more ways to mitigate luck, has some new dice and new tiles, and lots of new starter worlds.  This is an instant buy for me when it hits retail.  Sheriff of Nottingham - usually a good time, despite the fact that I'm completely awful at this game.  Sheriff is probably one of the most heavily group-dependent games I own, but it was a hit this week.  Alhambra - I've played a lot of Alhambra this year, and always have a pretty good time.  I have mostly been playing with expansions, and this time with the base set I played really poorly and didn't stand a chance.  One Night Ultimate Werewolf - another game that hasn't seen the table much recently, it was great to pull ONUW out again.  Still a favorite, despite the fact that I always seem to get a round where I'm the Lone Wolf and get caught extremely easily.  I'm really bad at wolf'in without someone to back me up.  Castles of Mad King Ludwig - another favorite, I'm thinkin about playing a lot more of this one again, especially in October when the new Secrets expansion comes out.  I got to play the expansion at a con a little while back, and it's another one that's an insta-buy for me.     I don't think I have a favorite that I never get to play.  I don't get to play Dead of Winter as often as I'd like to, but still get it to the table once in a while.  I don't really keep any games unless I think I will get to play them when I want to I'm somewhere around 60-70 games, and I'd say it's expanding slowly.  I have tried to trade/give/donate some of the games that didn't quite click for me, so it's been reduced a bit in the last few months, but only in anticipation of all of the Gencon releases that are coming up.  There are at least four games/expansions that are definitely being added, and probably more once the hype train hits full speed."
boardgames,3dxyfv,nonhiphipster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:16 2015 UTC,How the heck did you get access to a prototype for the expansion of Roll For The Galaxy?? So jealous! Also...any idea what the release date is on that?

boardgames,3dxyfv,Mufasa_92,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"I just recently started to play board games starting this week. I received Dead of Winter after plying it on vacation with some friends and I loved it. I have played it at least a dozen games the past week with multiple groups of friends.  Pandemic I bought during the amazon prime sale (what a let down) but I had a gift card and wanted to purchase more board games and had heard pandemic is a good one to have. Since watching it on tabletop i had a pretty good idea how to play and playing it the first time was a little slow at first but it picked up near the end and we had a great time, even though we got demolished.   Sushi Go I kind of bought this game on a whim not knowing what to expect i heard it was a fun game and easy to learn and it was cheap on amazon so i bought it, hoping for a good game. I lucked out because this game is awesome to play with people who arent big into board games but a great gateway to playing more intense games such as a dead of winter or pandemic. It plays like 7 Wonders but easier to learn may have less of a strategy overall but still an excellent buy.   Forbidden Desert After watching this game on tabletop i purchased it during the amazon sale as well, and after playing it once im glad i purchased it. Our group got very far into the game but the pilling up sand eventually was our downfall.  My collection is at 5 games that Ive purchased over the past week, and all of them have been great. Looking forward to buying more games."

Suchi Go looks pretty interesting. I may grab it for a quick game between heavier games.  Forbidden Desert is on my wishlist. It looks like a lot of fun. I really like the co-op aspect and the theme.
boardgames,3dxyfv,Auth3nticRory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:40 2015 UTC,pretty quiet week over here.  Catan: Seafarers - had to end it at 10points as more people were showing up.  It was my first time playing Seafarers so we played the first scenario.  Pretty good game.    Kingsburg - had to end it in the 4th year as it was getting late.  I came in last place as per usual.  I just can't win at this game.    Jaipur - showed my sister how to play this one and she loved it.  I beat her 2-0 :)     Favourite game that I NEVER get to play might be any of the Rosenburg titles due to length (with the exception of Glass Road)    I have about 80 games.

Ended up being a little disappointed by Bora (too much choice) and Belfort (not a lot of development for us). Red7 was good though as a filler choice. The venue was too loud for us but that probably was due to our choice of games really.  I love Twilight struggle but it is such a hard sell for non gamers.

The game went over like gangbusters, everybody loved it. This will see lots of time at the table. We then played Lords of Waterdeep which is ok imo but everyone else enjoyed it.  We were camping so there wasn't much gaming the rest of the week until last night when we got to try out Dead Men Tell no Tales. We had a bit of a rocky first play but we had not had a chance to read over the rules before diving in. One comment though, the rule book is a little vague and left us with a few questions. Afterwards we got into a game of Merchants and Marauders. This is such an awesome game, I never have a bad time playing. I played it safe as a merchant all game and came up a couple points short in the end.   Netrunner is a game I love and I only have one friend who plays and we do not play much at all these days. It scratches my CCG itch, wasn't really that expensive to get into and provides a very unique gaming experience. I own between 50-60 games after 2-3 years of serious collecting. We are definitely still expanding our collection but not nearly at the rate we were a year ago."

boardgames,3dxyfv,gamerthrowaway_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Questions first:     Twilight Struggle or Illuminati. I think I've played Illuminati twice in the last 6 years. I was going to at Origins and then never got around to it; too much to do already and I forgot I had it until Sunday when I was burnt out and had to drive home. I think I'm more sentimental about it than anything else. Twilight Struggle is the only Williams CDG Cold War era game I'm missing from the trio cause a friend has it and I would play against him. We haven't played a game since Christmas due to other commitments (and we both have been playing Fire in the Lake in place of it). I couldn't play it at home because we are sort of capped at about 90min stuff there with our schedules and we have pets so nothing gets left out in a paused state overnight or anything. It's stuff like that which makes me really want a game table where I can store stuff in the center well. I have about 50 games (and a ton of expansions for them since I can usually cram them in the base set box). For a while now, the collection has been stabilized in size. Since I'm currently packing to move, I'm trying to jettison some stuff, and will probably give away maybe 8 or 10 games to friends or family. I only have X amount of space I can keep stuff, and only so many hours of the day to play, so I don't see much reason in keeping a ton of games.     Games this week, or more aptly, the game this week:     Indonesia (5p, all newbies). So, this was the only game I played this week between packing and work. I'd traded for this at Origins earlier in the year and it had sat on my shelf for a while. I dug it out a couple weeks ago to read the rules and get familiar with the board and stuff. Low and behold, it quickly dawned on me why people redo the board. Absolutely beautiful to look at, but sort of shit to play with when I setup the demo game; too small, cluttered, and too stylized for it's own good. Someone on BGG had posted an alternative map and I printed that off, but not before over-sizing it to 55""x26"" (currently stored in a tube because the poster is too big for anything else). The boat/hull fiasco was solved by swapping them out for boats which everyone agreed was a serious improvement for usability, and I printed the jumbo corrected cards on card stock for the three eras. I discovered that one of my glass stones was chipped and needs to be replaced, so I'm going to replace that this week (maybe switch to little wooden buildings if I have trouble finding a replacement bead). We picked up some hidden money discs from Meeplesource at Origins and everyone was happy with that as well. Everyone was judicious about reading the rules in advance, and we got started after setting up. Looking back on it, I can see some things that I should have done better (I think most of us had that). Final scores hovered in the 1120-1330 range for 2-5th place while first scored something absurd like 1950 (shipping magnate and she prevented cities from expanding for a long time so the rice farmer juiced her earnings for 3 rounds in a row). I really get the idea that there are things you can calculate, but that the overall value of a company is sort of opaque courtesy of the merger process. It will always feel like it's at the tips of your fingers, but you can't quite get a hold of it. I'm ok with the game, my spouse more so. It will be interesting to see how the 2p game works as it's sort of zero-sum instead of this swirl you get by juicing a bid during the higher player counts. What annoys me about it is the operations phase is really fiddly; figuring out the max stuff to sell should be so much easier than it is (and we've already simplified it by having the shipping lines color coded and hull capacities listed right there on the die). Do people start at the front and work forward stretching out? Do you start at the far flung reaches of the world and work backward filling ships? What's the best method for quickly determining what you can get away with? Do you use pawns to track what goods have been shipped (we flipped the production tiles over as we sold each one and flipped them right side up after we were done since we had that grid work for each city to represent the sold goods). I've thought about picking up 20 small pawns like GMT uses in their COIN series games and using those for temp markers, but I don't know how I would effectively want to use them. Operations took way too long. Total game time from setup to clean up was just over 6 hours (2 rounds in era C, our end-game management skills were oddly absent today...)."

It feels like a mixture of Clue and Go Fish, and it was pretty fun.  We only played with two players, and I’m sure that it will be better with more players.  I’m looking forward to taking this one out again.  Diam: I went to a FLGS’s yard sale and picked this one up for 10$.  While I love these types of games, my girlfriend is not a fan of thinky abstracts.  Luckily, Diam can be played in a few minutes, so it helped keep her interest.  The beautiful components also helped.  I could see this one sitting on my coffee table.  Cockroach Poker: Played a quick game at 3 people and got destroyed.  I’m usually good at this game, but I got out-bluffed far and wide.    Biblios: Picked this up over the weekend and it is already one of our favorite fillers.  It is really easy to learn, yet at the end feels like a bigger game.  I’m looking forward to playing more of this one.    I wish I got to play Cosmic Encounter more often.  I really love that game.

My collection is a mere 35 games and it's expanding but not fast enough for my liking.   Iota - 5 plays, 2-4 players  and I just don't like the game. It's too dependent on getting larger numbers and encourages you to play things so they score in two lines which makes it very very hard to complete sets; The primary pattern is a simple stairstep or box.  Coup - 1 play, 4 players - still a lot of fun.  Forbidden Island 4 plays - 2, 3, 3, 4 players. Still a very enjoyable game, quick to teach and fun for my kids. I'm a big fan of cooperative games.  Flash Point 1 play, 4 players -- Ugg my wife likes this game but I just find it to be clunky. Thankfully the kids enjoy it. We did have the house collapse on us once, which is nice since we almost always win, but my daughter was distraught because the cat died.   Pirate Flux - lots of plays, it's fluxx, it's fun, but what happens if you don't address the person with the captains hat as ""Captain""?  Smash Up 4 players, 1 play - great game, enjoyable and I really like the pretty pretty expansion, but mainly due to the art and concept. The Horses and Princess decks in particular feel rather UP while the cats seem to be the best addition.  Cards Against Humanity - 2 plays, 5 hours (we ignored the end condition until we had too much beer) - wonderful game.  ""Immaculate Conception leads to Daddy Issues"".  Spyrium - 1 play 5 players - we didn't finish which is a bummer but one guy read the rulebook carefully and found out that if you're building over an existing building of the same type it reduces the cost of a new building by 3 which unlocked a buy of a factory in round 4 that I didn't anticipate and left me without a point engine."

boardgames,3dxyfv,vikingerik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"Stone Age.  Our boardgame cafe has a huge selection but somehow not this one.  I finally got my own copy back after lending it to my sister for a while.  So we played, with one of the highest scoring results I've ever seen, we all got a lot of farms early and then concentrated a lot of score multipliers in specific areas.  I got nipped 203 to 195, thanks to the 8th science card I needed never coming up as the last card in the deck.  Boss Monster.  I'd played it before but most of the rest of the group hadn't and wanted to try it.  The results followed what appears to be the standard script for coming to Boss Monster.  Fantastically cool theme and concept to lure in the players.  The first game had them wanting to try it again in order to implement some strategy.  Then by the end of the second game, they realized that the mechanics are so capricious that there isn't much strategy to implement, and the take-that spells are just unfun.  One player called it ""Munchkin in a straight line"" which is about right.  Ticket to Ride Marklin.  This one never seems to get much notice among the TTR variations.  It's the one with the passenger cargo mechanic.  We'd played it once before and only sort of got the hang of how to manage that.  I figured it out bigtime here, though.  What you need to do is build in a contiguous line to support the passenger runs, you can't try to play by cherrypicking routes or by starting your tickets at each end to later meet in the middle.  I put together a line of about eight routes including Berlin, ran all three passengers along it mostly before the other players did any, and racked up 85 points of cargo on my way to a 202 final score dominating the others in the 140s.  I like this version a lot now.  The passenger runs add a sense of tempo that's now sorely missing from the other TTRs, a race element that seriously matters.  Carcassonne, original without any expansions, our group actually just found this game in the last month.  Two games.  Both turned into a situation with one huge city contested by a lot of players.  In the first game, three players fought for it but the city never got completed, and the fourth player who stayed out of that fray won.  In the second game, all four players fought for the same city, which also never got completed.  It actually ended in a tie between me and one other player.  Although I should have won as we didn't notice that a monastery of mine had been completed a couple turns from the end, which would have given me another meeple placement for what would have been a winning margin.  Tokaido, and we still can't figure out what plays are even good in this game.  Each time we've played it (about four now), the winner said he didn't have any idea what he did that won.  Finally three games of King of Tokyo which is our usual late night outlet for yelling at each other.  I won two thanks to Jets landing in my lap each time, quite possibly the single most powerful card in the deck."
boardgames,3dxyfv,nonhiphipster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"Alien Frontiers: We started things off with this one, since we all just played it for the first time last week, and wanted to try it out again. I've gotta say...even after only the second game, it's starting to not hold up very well. I do really like like the worker placement mechanic to it (it reminds me of Lords Of Waterdeep in space), but I thing the game is actually hindered from  all the special abilities (I.e. Alien Tech cards and colony powers). The game can feel a bit wonky with all of this mixed in at once and being used so often. I'm not crazy about playing it again after this. It didn't help that our game seemed to last forever.  Love Letter Hobbit Edition: We needed something light and quick after all that intergalactic-backstabbing, so I grabbed this one of the shelf. It's kind of funny that there's 3 versions of Love Letter, yet they all do feel subtly  different. In fact, I think this one is my favorite...specifically because of the slight rules change associated with it. It is what it is. Kind of dumb fun.  Roll For The Galaxy (3x): Back in space (thematically speaking)  . This game is just a blast,and is definitely my favorite at the moment. I'm already looking forward to the expansion (which is rare for me).  If you haven't played it yet, there is a bit of a steep learning curve with it, mostly do to the iconography and understanding what the 5 different phases do. once you get over that you'll realize it's really not too difficult to grasp.   Camel up (2X): First time playing it. Gotta say, surprisingly fun! Definitely nothing too deep, you are essentially betting on camels and trying to decide who will win/lose the race. There's something just inherently silly about it that I liked a lot. Not sure how many times you could really play this though. It'd be nice of there was just a little more depth to it.  Sushi Go (2X): Finished things off with. a couple games of this. It's fun...again, maybe not the most strategic game there is around, but it's so quick and easy to set up that it always seems to hit the table."
boardgames,3dxyfv,Llama11amaduck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"We were visiting the inlaws this past weekend so we kept it pretty light on content & quantity.  Ticket to Ride - Was a hit once we got through the grueling rules process. I expected his mom to pick it up slowest (she's not a geography person & just based on personality) and his dad to get it no problem. Well, his dad wouldn't stop talking to my fiance's sister and then the two of them would ask a question that I literally just answered. I tried waiting for them to finish, but then my fiance was like ""Let's just play, hurry up & finish explaining!"" so then his dad started ""I'll figure it out as we go, don't worry about it"" all the while his mom was quiet as a mouse & understood everything perfectly (it's not a complex game). Once we got underway it was a good time, played 3 times this weekend.  Love Letter - I was wary to break this one out since TTR took soooo long to explain, but the reference cards combined with the card effects being right on them made it easier. There were a few questions, but for the most part it went fine. Only got through this one once.  Euchre - Not a board game, but his parents taught us this a while ago and we enjoy it. It's a trick-taking card game where you're on two teams of two. It was fun, per usual. Only got one play in.   I don't have one right now. Our collection is really small, so we play everything fairly evenly/normally. My collection is pretty small so I'm working on slowly but surely expanding it. Two of my friends each have a considerable collection & we are usually playing with one of them so it's hard to expand and not duplicate too much. The duplicate games I did buy are ones I thought we could play with family/other friends."

After all, I lost to a 12-year-old. It was still fun though.  Pit - Always a fun party game, but less so with 4 people.  Sushi Go - A worthwhile investment. Easy and cute drafting game that's great for kids. I even convinced my friend to buy it for his youth group. He says his mom's strategy is to pick the cutest cards.

Forbidden Stars 4p, still great, this time we built the map ourselves even though we had 2 new players. Dramatically reduced play time together with better explaining. Ultramarines took away the lead by quickly grabing a VP at the other end of the map before recalling the units via the drop pod battle card. Add some aggressive upgrading and win after round 4 =)"

boardgames,3dxyfv,fissionessence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yomi — I enjoy this game, but I have trouble getting friends to play with me. One friend can't get past the paper-scissors-rock aspect and thinks it's just too random. He decided to let his two-year-old daughter choose the cards, and after she grew bored, he just selected his plays randomly. I easily beat him by using fast attacks and dodges since odds are his moves will be attacks (there are more attacks than anything else in many character decks). However, I did take a surprising amount of damage when I foolishly decided to throw a couple times.  Marvel Legendary — We played a three-player game against Mysterio orchestrating a Skrull invasion. We used the Marvel Legendary Randomizer app, which yielded us Spider-Man, Forge, Deadpool, Silver Surfer, Rocket Raccoon, and Star-Lord. I built a deck with mostly Silver Surfers and one Oddball Deadpool, but I could never get the Silver Surfer that focuses for attack, and I ended up not doing much. My friend had a reasonable Spider-Man-based deck, but my girlfriend went crazy with shards using multiple Rockets and Element Guns. We beat Mysterio with two master strikes played.  Abyss — The three of us then played Abyss, and my friend acquired a ton of lords sans keys. He ended up not gaining a location, but he ended the game through having seven lords. My girlfriend was a bit peeved when she had to discard down to six cards and then later had to pay pearls, but she affiliated a ton of seahorse allies and got the location that rewarded her for it, securing her victory.  Best Friends — This is a prototype my friend is working on. It's a medium-light worker-placement game to support friendship and good decision-making for teenagers. I was more focusing on my own play, so I can't speak to the others' strategies, but I used my funny friend to gain happiness, which yielded me more time (workers). I did a lot of community services, gaining me respect and then a bit of money, which I used to buy a car. Once I maxed out my respect and time, I spent time at the social gathering to gain more friends and spent as much time as I could with them to earn enough friendship points for victory. My girlfriend played a couple awkward rules incorrectly, so depending on how you want to interpret the playtest, one could argue that she won :)  Alchemists — The three of us then played Alchemists, which I had been looking forward to playing again. I really enjoy the deduction with the worker placement and the magic of the app, but the publishing sometimes bothers me, as two potion-mixings can give me enough information about a reagent to narrow it down to two alchemicals. But then I have to publish and guess between those remaining two. I can hedge on the unsure color or place a points ribbon. This means I can decide to bet on what is essentially a coin flip, and that can decide the game. (And in this case, it did.) My friend was quite pleased with himself that he used his Periscope to solve all eight reagents, while I only solved three. But one of the ones I was able to narrow down I had already hedged on and thus couldn't switch out a points ribbon, virtually losing me 3 points. I earned a lot more points through the purchase of four artifacts (one of which scored for having more artifacts), but my girlfriend pulled out the victory (by 2 points) just through solid betting and guessing and efficiency. I still love the game, but I wish there were mechanisms to avoid that coin-flip aspect. Maybe it's just a flaw in my strategy.  Quest: Awakening of Melior — This is my single-player card game that's on Kickstarter right now. However, my girlfriend and I played our cooperative variant on her stream, and that video's available on YouTube for those interested.   My favorite game I never get to play is Imperial Settlers. I bought Why Can't We Be Friends and am greatly looking forward to Atlanteans, but I haven't even used the first expansion yet because of how much my girlfriend hates the game. She just doesn't want to deal with so many cards with different abilities all in play at once. She's really good at optimizing, but she doesn't want to have to do the thinking required to optimize with that many factors in play."

boardgames,3dxyfv,rugbygooner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"My 7 year(nearly 8 in my defense) year old brother beat me in 3 straight games of King of New York which mostly hurt my pride. Didn't go easy on him but gave him some guidance if I thought he wasn't noticing something but still.  Later that day played Lords of Waterdeep for the first time with opposition more my speed apparantly 4 player game. Took a bit longer than it probably should have but 1 player in particular just didn't seem to ""get"" the mechanics so there was a good bit of walking through but I think everyone got comfortable with it at the end so I expect another would go much quicker. That may have all been an elaborate bluff since she emerged as the big threat after a few turns. I managed to avoid much suspicion as I was never in the lead I never felt I had a chance as my lord's quest types just were not coming out until very late in the game. Ended up pulling off the most perfect(and massively lucky) last turn that let me get and cash in 2 quests that I didn't have the resources for going into the turn, that netted me just over 30 points overall and I ended up beating previously mentioned player by 6. Enjoyed it way more than I thought and I really want to try other worker placement games now.  Favourite game I never get to play? Carcassonne. But that should change 1 of 2 ways as I may be moving in with a friend that owns it. And either way I'm picking up Carcassonne Southern Seas to play with my brother which looks fun.  My collection is tiny. The only board game I care to mention having is King of New York. EDIT: And scrabble with my ma I guess, which I do love playing.  Definitely expanding. Waiting on 3 games mostly for the purposes of playing with younger brother(s). Castle Panic which looks fun and something they would enjoy even if the younger one mightn't quite follow exactly but sure what harm? Want to get more co-op games to play with them(age appropriate so no Arkham/Eldritch Horror). Carcassonne South Seas, which I hope I enjoy as much as the original, mostly picked it up as it was significantly cheaper than any other iteration. And Qwirkle which looks okay, not something I'd generally buy but I'm getting purely because I hope it can act as a game that I can play with both my mum and my brother. Hope the scrabble-esque elements can lure my mother in and that it's something my brother could actually be competitive at because he's good at spelling for his age but he's still 7 and me and mum are ruthless and overly competitive when it comes to scrabble sooooo yeah."

Super light, super short, huge box for a few cards and a couple diamonds. I'm terrible at it, but I like it well enough to keep it for now. Good for when you need a 10 minute game that truly is (I'm looking at you Love Letter)  Cacao - This game keeps getting played. Still really digging on it. Definitely one of my favorites of the year.   The Voyages of Marco Polo - First Play! Played this solo to learn it, then taught my wife to play.

Got a terrible first mystery that I didn't solve the entire game. For the weekend I went camping and got to play a quick game of cranium but the fact that I've been so busy has left board gaming a bit in the dust. I'm hoping to meet up with some friends next weekend and crank out some games of Resident Evil Deck builder but we'll see.  One game I love to play that I haven't played in a long time is Twilight Imperium. The long play times and the fact my friends are all married has seriously hampered any of their drive to play it.  My collection is on the smaller side with about 15 games but I'm hoping to continue expanding it with some more casual and competitive games. I have a lot of in depth competitive games and a lot of coop games but I'm generally a competitive person so I'm missing the feeling of out strategizing someone.

I don't think I won a single game in this push your luck dice game lol. Still a ton of fun and one my parents could get into because of how easy it is to learn.  Villages - Played with 2/3 players. Cool game by Fridge Crisis Games. It's pretty much Gin Rummy with battles, which works well with the pixel art and fantasy theme. The expansions hurt the 2 player game because of how many colors there are available to make villages. 3 players was a better time I think when all the expansions were mixed in.  Forbidden Island - Played with 3/4 players. Quick co-op to pick up. For avid gamers, it's a tad on the easy side. But there's a way to ratchet up the difficulty, and that is in setting the water level higher to the ""elite""/""legendary"" level before starting the game. So when we played at the ""elite""+ level, we found ourselves having to make decisions that actually affected the game. Otherwise, it seemed like the game played itself."

It was a mega hit. Foam guns for the win. I don't even remember who won except for the second game we played because the undercover cop won.  Also played Sushi Go! and Forbidden Island, which are always a good time.  Saturday was an all-day gaming day where I finally learned Tzolk'in, checked out Euphoria, played some more Cash & Guns, and ended the evening with Coup.  Yesterday my sister actually deigned to play a game with me! I broke out Splendor because she wanted something ""without too many rules"" and it's usually a hit with new folks.

I don't really have a favorite game. I haven't played most of my games! I want to play as many games as possible, because mostly I just like touching bits and moving them around a board and spending time with friends.

The first-timers won with the scoreline as followed: 39, 39, 37, 32. Very quick game once everyone understands the scoring pathways.  Biblios (3p) - I was able to pick up some high point cards in two categories and I managed to draw some church cards during the drafting phase and let me bump up my die categories early. Unfortunately my wife got church cards later in the auction phase and changed my die every time allowing my mother-in-law to sneak out the victory 8 to 6 to 3. The wife was relentlessness on me :/  Jaipur (2p) - Mother-in-law really enjoys this game and it is one of her favorites. The first round ended 60-59 in my favor. It was a quick round with larger sells of the non-luxury goods and only a few luxury good sold. The second round was the opposite. I won the second round 97-67. I starting out with a hand of 3 diamonds...  Patchwork (2p) - Mother-in-law really enjoys this game too. She's beaten me both times we have played previously and nothing changed with the 3rd play. She beat me 15 to 12 and she completed the 7x7 bonus. We both had to pass 2-3 times at the end of the game because neither of us could add any of the 3 tiles in front of the marker to our boards. First time that was an issue for both players.  The Castles of Burgundy (2p) - Mother-in-law's first game of CoB. She caught on to the mechanics very quickly but strategy was lacking (but that's fine on the first couple plays). She ended up beating me 173 to 171 in about 80 minutes. It's been a year since I played CoB so we both had scoring errors and missed some science tile abilities once placed. I don't understand how this game can be played in 30 minutes. The playing time on the box is so misleading when compared with other games. 30-90 minutes seems only reasonable for seasoned veterans especially at 2+ players. My wife and I are still so-so with this game and feel like it drags on a round too long.  Love Letter (4p - two new timers) - My brother (a new timer) won the game 2 to 1 to 1 to 1. We decided to do a tie-break on the 5th round instead of first to 3 affection tokens. I don't know how my brother won because everyone was attacking him. It was pretty amazing actually.  Saboteur (5p - 4 new timers) - We only played two rounds. My brother and I were the saboteurs both rounds. Fortunately for us we had the cards to remove path pieces which is too brutal for the gold diggers to overcome. Everyone really enjoyed the game, except my wife who isn't sold on deception/hidden role games. She also is not the biggest fan of The Resistance: Avalon. I recently picked up Sheriff of Nottingham and I hope she will find that game enjoyable...  Carcassonne + The Tower + Inns and Cathedrals Expansions (2p) - The Tower expansion is pure evil. My wife had 3-4 of my meeples at one point. This expansion really lowers your total points because you can steal meeples from other players off their features. My wife beat me down 151 to 119."

Mindtrap II - 6p - Picked this up at a thrift store a while ago, decided to give it a shot.

One Night: Ultimate Werewolf - 5/6p - Had to convince a non-gamer friend to play after seeing a couple of rounds. We have fun with this game for sure, but on in our group just doesn't like it. He still plays, but since it is sometimes impossible to know if someone is lying, he gets frustrated. But he still plays, and everyone else has fun, so no worries.    (1) I'd say Agricola. I really like it, but one of our core members doesn't and my wife isn't a huge fan, so it rarely hits the table.  (2) I have ~37 games or so at last count. It's not shrinking, but I'm not actively growing it(famous last words). I buy stuff if it's a good deal, like I just picked up Resistance for $1 off BGG."
boardgames,3dxyfv,tiny_markatas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"Played a few learning games of Space Hulk with the missus. Beachhead (me: 'stealers) and Suicide Mission (me: marines).  Got a few things wrong with Beachhead, but played Suicide Mission correct (far as I could tell). Genestealers won both games, though that's because wife kinda gave up when she couldn't win Beachhead (she could still draw) and Suicide Mission is just... well, it's stacked against the marines :p  Fun game so far, and she's excited enough to play so that's nice. Hour, give or take, is enough to play a match while the baby's napping so that's cool too. Time will tell if this was a worthy purchase or an expensive flop.   What's your favorite game you never get to play?   I wouldn't say ""never"", but I suppose that would be Cyclades. It really wants 4-5 players, and I mainly play with 3-4. And my group (and myself) are already in love with Kemet and we just finished a long Descent campaign which took a lot of our time. I've also procured a few games that play 4 quite nicely, making Cyclade's spot even more competed over. I might need to look into getting another game group going to get more mileage out of my games.   How large is your collection, and are you in the process of reducing or expanding it?   Including the two games I'm purchasing within the next few weeks: 10. As the above sentence implies, I'm still growing it, though I've made a soft decision not to buy anything after the next two for rest of the year. I'm already at a point where I have more games than I can comfortably play under current circumstances."

Excellent game, but I feel that like Tic-tac-toe there is a perfect strategy that can allow someone to always win. It's difficult to remember, but it's a (almost) solved game."
boardgames,3dzycd,GEBnaman,6,Mon Jul 20 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"It's a solved game; solved in the 1980's on Macintoshes, in fact.  But the solution is a draw - neither side can force a win.   It would make for a boring game with perfect play on both sides, but humans are fortunately imperfect, and, as the researcher stated in the above link:   the examination of mid- and endgame databases has repeatedly shown optimal play to be beyond human comprehension. Therefore, I very much doubt that any such simple-to-describe strategy exists.    With no simple human-grokkable strategy to produce perfect play, we can continue to muddle along and enjoy the game despite its solved status. (Checkers is also solved, and known to be a draw. It's widely believed that Chess is a draw as well, although we will likely never be able to prove that.)"

boardgames,3dzycd,GEBnaman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that almost all abstract games are ""solved"".  Most of our games can be considered ""solved"", only if given the correct circumstances.  Take for examples Lords of Waterdeep. I've played the iOS enough (well over 1000 games) to see particular combinations of buildings, quests and intrigue cards that can land you really high scores. If someone were lucky enough to have this combination early, it will guarantee them a win.  However just because these games are 'solved' (like others have said) doesn't take the fun out of the game. They are merely hypothetical situations that could happen, but with so many variables each time these are played make said situations unlikely.  What makes ""Nine-mens-Morris"", and ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" flat is that there isn't enough variables. I've played both of these games enough that I can either always win or draw regardless of what they play. There's no fun in that for me."
boardgames,3dzycd,SoupOfTomato,3,Tue Jul 21 11:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that almost all abstract games are ""solved"".   That's not at all true, and it's a false equivalence. ""Abstract game"" covers a wide range; there's not any necessary connection between the number of variables and the amount of theme (or lack thereof).  Tic-Tac-Toe is flat not because it's abstract, but because it's trivial. There are only about 250,000 possible games; if you factor in rotations and reflections (so that e.g. X starting in any corner is ""the same move""), that goes down to only about 25,000.   Compare that to Chess, where there are 200,000 possible board positions you could be in just 4 moves into the game. That goes up exponentially, so with a typical game lasting around 40 moves, the total number of possible positions is estimated at above 1040. Every time someone plays chess, it's likely that exact game has never occurred before in the 1500-year history of the game.  Go is even more ridiculous, with a number of legal positions around 10170.  Nine Men's Morris is in between Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess. While its total number of positions of around 8 billion puts it closer to the Tic-Tac-Toe end, there's still enough variation to keep the game interesting for grownups for a lot longer than Tic-Tac-Toe.    To bring things a little closer to this sub's home turf, look at ZÈRTZ - the first player has 648 possible opening moves. Every non-capture shrinks the size of the board, so that doesn't explode as much as it could, but it's still a very deep game.   Several games have been solved, and most of those are 2-player games of perfect information, which tend to be abstracts.  But the implication doesn't go the other way - a two-player perfect-information game may not have enough complexity to make you happy, but that doesn't mean we're anywhere close to solving it.  EDIT: From the Nitpick department - corrected ""Zertz"" to ""ZÈRTZ"". Also, the first player has fewer moves than I posted, because if they put a ball on the perimeter, they can't then remove the ring that the ball is on. So it's only 648 possible opening moves rather than 666."
boardgames,3dzycd,hkaps,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"For any significantly complicate game (like this or Checkers), ""solved"" is a pointless complaint. Just because a computer can run through every permutation until it finds the solved game, does not mean humans will ever be able to comprehend perfect play."

With a young child I have looked at a number of them and backed a few.  Many end with less then $20k but typically had lower funding goals.  I also think they haven't done a great job reaching fans of Josh's work; I tend not to look on Kickstarter anymore unless I know something from a designer I like is on there.

More seriously, though... my actual thoughts as a Dad that plays with a 7 year old, a 10 year old, and an 11 year old. It's a kids/family game, yet it only plays 2, for 29 bucks (plus shipping!). That was my first thought, and enough to close the page right there.   So, maybe they don't know this... there are other games out there that can get my kid into the hobby, with similar cost, and play way more kids. As a dad, I notice a lot of games will tout, ""Get your kids into the hobby!"" Well, yeah, I'm already doing that, with current and, frankly, tighter and cooler games. And, just because your theme is appropriate, ie: Broccoli fighting men with cracker shields, doesn't guarantee kids like it.   One on one, direct conflict, is something parents don't tend to focus on while bringing their kids into the hobby in the first place. As we all know, kids are immature, feel picked on, in a sort of cross their arms, harrumphing, sort of way, when you beat em up in a game. So if I'm going to do that...  I've done Magic the Gathering with my son when he was 6, which in a ""this is how the game will play out""style sort of way, seems similar, (we sit across from each other and cards are things and do stuff) but I know that with Magic that I get to go through my own cards, select ones specifically for him, whether based on skill level or coolness factor. ""No broccoli fighters here, boy. How about spooky ghosts,  dragon warriors,  and lightning spells?""  I dunno. Those are my two cents. It started typing this at the exact point when I saw it was 29 bucks and 2 players, yet for kids, but there is/are more than just one kid.  So, I think that's the biggest thing, reduce the component factor, chop the price in half, and it looks... fine? (but still probably wouldn't back, personally)"

My hypothesis also says this will make the game look uglier in 10 years when the tape turns yellow, so we'll see :)  I am using 3M thick clear packing tape (less bendy).  If a drink HAS to be on the table because there's no other option, put it as close to the edge of the table as possible:  Assuming every human being will get excited as they move their arms to grab pieces, the edge means it will be knocked over as they are returning their arms after grabbing something, therefore knocking said drink off the table completely, breaking glass, and carefully clearing it all up for 30 minutes... but at least it didn't get on the game!  Be careful reaching for a rulebook once the snacks are out:  You'll end up with that permanent cheeto stain on your rulebook that you'll pick at with your fingernail for the next 5 years."

If you are in a country that allows possession of firearms, or you have loose morals, obtain one or more firearms. If you are not in a country that allows firearms, buy a bat or sword. You may have to learn some firing principles, such as not getting your board games caught in the crossfire. A bullet hole or sword slash right across your copy of Eldritch Horror is a sign of your failure to keep your board games safe. Have your board games locked in a cupboard. Bandits may not have the time to force entry to it. Drill your family in the dead of night simulating board game bandit raids. Have escape routes plotted for your board games. And your family I suppose. Train yourself to resist interrogation. If you are taken unawares the bandits may demand to know where the board games are kept. It will all be for naught if you can't keep your board games safe. Get a mean dog or shark. Put a paint can on string at every stairwell. I saw this in Home Alone and it was very effective. Compartmentalise your board game collection. I see so many people putting board games on one big shelf. Big mistake. If a bandit finds it they will take the lot. You need to put them in multiple discreet locations, so if one is discovered you only lose a copy of Agricola. A small sacrifice so that the others may live on.   That should be a good start. Let me know if you need any more pointers on keeping your board games safe."

We turn it into the camel Kentucky Derby naming the camels making small cash bets while drinking. You do get less actions but, that just makes each action that much more important. We all end up laughing and yelling at the camels like they're actually in control of the race, that sort of experience completely depends on your group though."
boardgames,3dyac0,Coffeedemon,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"Ha, that sounds like a great time. I think the majority of the play-throughs of this game that I have facilitated were when there were at least one or two new players which might have led to my opinion that it is better for each player to get more actions. Perhaps when I do try it with the full complement of 8 (or 10 if I grab the expansion) I'll find it is way more fun! :-)"

I have played Terra Mystica around 3-4 times at board game night at my FLGS and loved it. The kicker is I think I have burnt my SO out for anything too heavy with my over-eager Robinson Crusoe purchase and general lack of knowledge about board gaming back then.

The easiest thing I can think of is to get all the games shipped to my house, I would then take this/these boxes to the post office to post.

Otherwise, if you don't mind losing a small percentage of the money to a service, you can find an escrow website, where a third party holds the money.  Basically, he would pay the money to a third party service, and they would be directed to pay you when certain conditions are met, like certified delivery, or when he tells them he's received the games.  You could set it up so that you send the game with a return receipt that gets sent to the escrow company, so that when the games are delivered to him, the receipt goes to the escrow company, and they know the games have been delivered, and send you a check."

I can see how that might matter for an expensive purchase (like a motor vehicle), but for board games, I can't tell whether a game has been played twice or even three times.

If the game has been punched, and played once or twice, and the pieces still look as if they've never been played with, then what if the person selling it says it's never been played?  How is anyone else going to know?        As far as I'm concerned, unless the game is unpunched, and the components are still bagged/treed/wrapped, and it's OBVIOUS that the game has never been played, then as far as I know, it's been played before.  How is the seller going to guarantee that a punched game has never been played before?      What's the value difference between ""punched and never played, in like new condition"" and ""punched, played once, in like new condition""?  If it's open, it's ""used"", regardless of how many times it's been played.  What kind of price difference would you expect to see between ""punched, never played"", and ""punched, played twice, but still in brand new condition"" if you can't tell any difference in the pieces?"

I do expect them to have be in reasonably good condition and have no important missing pieces.  Reasonably good condition does naturally depend on the age of the game and what sort of game it is.    What generally keeps me from buying used is the price.  If the game is in print, it's almost never cheaper to buy a used copy and have it shipped."
boardgames,3dxv2d,raged_norm,12,Mon Jul 20 13:23:36 2015 UTC,This.  People don't value the game they are selling correctly generally so I'll pay the extra £1 or so for a new copy against a used copy.  I have one exception. I'd like a copy of Himalaya (the game that got rethemed to Lords of DixitXidit) and that isn't going to be reprinted.
boardgames,3dxv2d,Geeky_Frignit,9,Mon Jul 20 13:36:17 2015 UTC,I can't believe the prices that people put on used games sometimes. You shouldn't be listing a used game $5 less than the price of a new game on Amazon. It needs to be at least half of what is readily available because I have to account on $12-$15 shipping.  Thankfully there are some people that realize this (i.e. I just recently purchased Patchistory sleeved and  lightly used for $42 shipped which is $13 less than new on Amazon without sleeves).
boardgames,3dxv2d,OutlierJoe,3,Mon Jul 20 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"Shipping does often tend to make any reasonable deals on used games, unreasonable. And local trades tend to jack up the price, because they can. Their competition is shipping rates  I prefer a straight-up game swap, personally, and each party pays for shipping of their incoming game.  Outside of that, I'll go with a FLGS' Used Game in-store credit. It's almost always the better deal, in my experiences."
boardgames,3dxv2d,ddog510,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"The reason we list it for that much is because it sells.

boardgames,3dxv2d,holidaymonkey,4,Mon Jul 20 14:06:29 2015 UTC,"This has definitely been my experience in the UK - high prices, then you need to pay postage.

Might as well have brand new for an extra pound..."

These include: King of Tokyo, Castles of Burgundy, Race for the Galaxy, Qwirkle, Arkadia, Olympos, Forbidden Island, Formula D, Through the Ages, Wrath of Ashardalon (and more!)."

boardgames,3dxv2d,PrWNed,4,Tue Jul 21 00:15:31 2015 UTC,Even at thrift store prices? I don't think I could pass up several of the games on my wishlist if the only thing wrong was a damaged box. But my soul would hurt a little bit.
boardgames,3dxv2d,bibbi123,3,Mon Jul 20 13:32:36 2015 UTC,Thrift store prices are probably a different story :)  If it were possible to just buy the box of a game I would totally do that though...

Caylus, missing instruction book, $1.99.  Quarto and Ingenious new in shrink, $3.99 each.  And don't get me started on the older, out-of-print stuff I've lucked into.  I do make sure the game is clean and complete before buying, unless what's missing is easily replaced or I'm buying strictly for parts.

I found something worth buying about once every other week, on average.  It just became habit, really.  I took some time away from it when I got too many games.  I bought a lot of stuff that I wasn't interested in playing, but had value.  Then personal life got difficult, and I just quit entirely.  When I started going back to the thrifts about 6 months ago, I was devastated to see that most of them had pretty much quit carrying board games entirely.  I see a few every now and then, but it's mostly party games and children's games.  Still, it's worth keeping an eye out during spring cleaning and garage sale seasons."

boardgames,3dxv2d,UninspiredWriter,7,Mon Jul 20 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"It depends of the game, the quality  of the components, the price and its availability on the market.  I bought used games like ""Pillars of the Earth"". It was hard to find, good price and in excellent shape. The lady did not liked it and it is my style of game. Good deal for both of us.  However, one time I found out Kemet. It was labeled as ""as new, opened and never played"" and the guy was asking 15$ less then the original price. When I called him, he explained he bought it at a local game shop and did not know it was some kind of wargame. Then he asked me to pay the full price with tax to help him since the game is ""as new"". I refused for two reasons:   The game is not new anymore, it was opened. The store is offering a member card where for every 10$ spent, you got points. Get enough points and you get a 20$ discount on your next purchase.   So I would have paid a full price for an opened game and get no points. Right. Deal canceled."
boardgames,3dxv2d,UninspiredWriter,6,Mon Jul 20 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"Guy sounds like he's taking advantage of you, advertising for $15 less and increasing it to full+tax."

boardgames,3dxv2d,zz_x_zz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:35 2015 UTC,Are there any rare games that you would buy even if the components were slightly worn/damaged?
boardgames,3dxv2d,Sycris12,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"No. If the box got some damage, no big deal. But the components must be in good if not great shape. These are the most important parts of the game. I don't want to run after components replacement."
boardgames,3dxv2d,tasman001,8,Mon Jul 20 13:39:04 2015 UTC,100% of my collection is used games. Prices in Quebec are pretty bad and the 15% tax rate doesn't help either. All the games I got have been played by the previous owner but were all in surprisingly good conditions (near mint). Board gamers here really take good care of their stuff. Conditions for a buy are mostly money: if its less than 40% MSRP I'll consider it.
boardgames,3dxv2d,bbacher,5,Mon Jul 20 14:44:38 2015 UTC,"Because shipping cost can be so high, unless it's a local pickup I usually don't buy too many used games.  The price just typically isn't that great of a deal after you factor in $15 for shipping.  The one exception is for out of print games, especially wargames.  Some wargames go years and years between print runs and if I'm really itching for a copy I'll check out the BGG marketplace where, unless it's especially rare, you can usually find a copy for not much more than MSRP.  For instance, Sekigahara, a game I've been thinking about grabbing, has 2 copies in the marketplace right now for $75, compared to $69 MSRP.  Not too bad in my opinion if you want to skip waiting for the next printing."
boardgames,3dxv2d,GreatGonzo,4,Mon Jul 20 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't.  I am too anal about the components being pristine.  That being said, I probably would."

First, I rarely buy games to begin with, so I don't mind paying the premium for a new game. Second, I don't want to have to count components. Third, cards get sticky and greasy pretty fast. Fourth, I like the feeling with new games that it is completely mine. :)"

Generally, my system is the same as /u/PrWNed that is half price + $5 -$10 depending on how expensive the game is normally.   And most of the games I get have no damage, maybe a bit of shelf wear on the box.  A couple of the games most of the components were still in their packaging, only the shrink wrap was removed(Got WotR for $60CAD and everything was brand new, a scuff in the corner was all. Sells for about $90 here).  Someone said in an earlier post that the majority of people buying these modern board games are either collectors or people that will play it for about a year or two then trade/sell it for something new.  So odds are most of these games used are well looked after, sometimes sleeved, and in great condition...for 50%.    Christmas time is great.  All the board gamers buying their non-gamer friends board games, and they turn around and sell them online.  Its like second Christmas for me."
boardgames,3dxv2d,VinnyValentini,3,Mon Jul 20 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"Normally, I'd say that I'm fine with used games if they're in good condition but the problem is that people just seem to have different ideas as to what constitutes ""good"". I've gotten games in unplayable condition that were reported as ""good"". It's also a complete crapshoot for me since I sleeve cards and most board gamers don't believe in preserving their cards in a way that makes their backs indistinguishable from one another so that whatever information they constitute is adequately hidden."
boardgames,3dxv2d,danickel1988,3,Mon Jul 20 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"As often as I can. I've purchased 15 used games so far.  I'm always trying to save on costs, and Craigslist has been great for getting awesome deals; I check if there's anything good a few times a week. I've picked up Torres, Alhambra, Tsuro and Word on the Street for $10 each.  eBay is great for deals sometimes. I create email alerts for games I want within a price range. I've picked up (shipping incl.) Pentago for $10, Pandemic for $22 and Lords of Vegas for $28. All were in great condition.  Sometimes I want something out of print or hard to find. E.g. Modern Art, I'm the Boss!, TZAAR, ZERTZ.  And sometimes I'd prefer to buy a previous edition that's higher quality. E.g. Acquire, Hey That's My Fish Deluxe.  Once, I almost picked up my white whale, Manila (RGG, 2005), but the bidding war got out of hand and I didn't want to spend $65 on it."

boardgames,3dxv2d,Lalitrus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"Currently 25% of my games have been bought used. I don't mind some wear 'n tear, though I do expect that to affect the price. In any case, I generally expect the price to be low, around 50% off retail. Though there's room for negotiation both ways depending on condition, rarity etc..  I define used game to be anything I've bought from a private individual, even if it's unopened. This is because at least around here there are pretty good laws protecting the buyer from bad retail experiences. Consumer-to-consumer protection is a lot more lacking though. That protection is of value to me, so when I forfeit it (= buy used) I expect it to reflect in the price, even if the game is in pristine condition.  I'm a gamer first, and not really a collector. I don't care that much about the quality of my used copy so long as it has everything I need to play in acceptable condition (marked role cards would be no-no, general wear 'n tear, bent minis etc would be acceptable)."
boardgames,3dxv2d,OpT1mUs,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:57 2015 UTC,I have no problem buying used games as long as it has all of it pieces and is in good order.  Some games you sort of have to buy used unless you want to pay a premium.  Out of print games for instance. Games that are in high demand. etc.
boardgames,3dxv2d,cardflopper,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"I have bought a bunch of games on BGG auctions recently. Great experience so far and reasonable prices for me.

boardgames,3dxv2d,AdmiralCrackbar,2,Mon Jul 20 14:26:02 2015 UTC,"To me, bargain hunting and making good deals on trades is part of the fun of collecting. I'd rather have a slightly beat up box and game than pay full MSRP on anything. As long as all the components are there and playable, I'm happy. If the game is shinier/newer than that, I'm extra happy!  My standards are pretty low. As long as cards and cardboard aren't creased, ripped, unreadable or otherwise unusable, I'm good with some frayed edges or bending or scuffing. If a couple tokens are missing, but there's enough to play smoothly, or they're easily replaced, I'm good. And as long as the box is structurally sound and protects the pieces, I'm good. I just want the price to reflect the condition."
boardgames,3dxv2d,Xzeno,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"I do, but it must be as near to mint condition as possible. Since I keep my games that way, and I trade them, I expect the same thing. Haven't had a bad experience yet."

boardgames,3dxv2d,Mechator_Rex,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, because games go out of print.  What I'm willing to pay and what standard I expect depends largely on how rare the game is, how old it is and how likely it is to come back into print."

If you really want to do local you can try Craigslist as well. These are places I check - if people have other places to look that would be awesome!  2) Price point: I personally would not buy a game that is within $10 of Amazon's list price - at that point I would rather pay an extra $10 for a new game. Of course this only applies for games in stock. This $10 INCLUDES shipping for me.   I didn't answer everything but hope this helps"

I recommend doing a quick check of something like eBay and seeing what the item has sold for in the past and using that as your base guide. However, for a more general rule of thumb... about 40-50% (give or take a few dollars) less than someone can buy it from Amazon/CSI is your best best. Feel free to fidget with the numbers based on rarity/popularity/demand, of course. Also Keep in mind that you ALSO need to account for Shipping/Handling while pricing, which can make selling small games very difficult. Shipping. For most single, normal games, USPS Priority Mail is fantastic. Super easy, reasonably priced, fast shipping. If you're shipping a BUNCH of stuff or the FFG coffin boxes, you're gonna need to spring for something else. Condition. Like New (should look pretty much flawless), Played (minor scuffing, scartching, etc), and Worn (heavily played, real damage to pieces, etc) work for me. Describe any issues (missing pieces, bent cards, etc). I also recommend pictures of the components to supplement your description, that way there is no confusion over what you offered. I've sold exclusively on eBay and it works pretty well."

I also sometimes find good deals that I jump on - I managed to get a copy of Agricola without the disks but with the wood box and Mayday premium meeples for $30 plus cheap shipping.  Well worth buying an open box to get.  I got 7 Ages for half price - and it was unpunched! (The person couldn't get it to the table and wanted to sell it to someone who would play it - I have and it is competing with Bios: Megafauna for top spot right now).  I even bought Runewars with expansion that was mostly punched and gasp missing the expansion box.

Generally, if it's not complete, we don't buy it. (There have been exceptions.)  If the box is damaged, that just means a discount off their original asking price. If I can get it at 25% of the price and need to tape the box, so be it. I like the look of my collection but I like playing games more."
boardgames,3dxv2d,TheJokersChild,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think I will ever buy a used game. I think the main reason is because board games aren't that expensive to buy in brand new condition, so it is not really worth the risk playing in used components that might be damaged easily due to wear. Furthermore it is also a hassle to check and make sure every components are there. However, if I am 100% sure the game is opened but not played (even if pieces are punched), I wouldn't mind saving some bucks and buy that, but you just never know. And if the box is damaged but still sealed, I will buy that too as long as components are not damaged."

You'll be aggressively bidding on land, carefully watching each others growing town, market, and available pieces. It works well with two players and only gets better from there."
boardgames,3e09em,Lemem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"Can't agree with this more. Keyflower is an amazing game that plays well at all player counts. The game presents you with so many great choices! Do I bid, do I play in my town or do I play in someone else's town? Every choice has its pros and cons and the game has enough variability that you will be seeing a different combination of tiles every game so that your decisions are going to change from game to game. I find that the game is relatively easy to teach; you can bid, activate a tile on your turn or pass. It's one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it."

boardgames,3e09em,ABigDumbBaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:35 2015 UTC,BattleCON is pretty fantastic in any situation if you're even remotely interested in fighting games. The game is somewhat pricey but you get enough content to play for ages. It really shines with regular opponents though and I wouldn't recommend it if you have any analysis paralysis prone players because that can make a game drag like you wouldn't believe. You could always put moves on a timer if its a problem though.

It plays really well with 2, and scales up to 4 perfectly, with the only downside being an extended play time.  The production values are top notch, and it looks beautiful on the table.  Each of the four factions require completely different strategies, as well, which should provide plenty of longevity going forward."

boardgames,3dxxgq,fenrrris,7,Mon Jul 20 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"I love Combat Commander but it's definitely much more streamlined than ASL (which I'm only faintly familiar with, granted).  If what you really want is ASL then you might be better off restarting with a small set putting your effort towards finding a ASL group.  I'm not sure where you live but you could start combing through/posting on BGG looking for players.    Combat Commander is a bit less abstract than Conflict of Heroes but still probably not the simulation that you're looking for.  What Combat Commander does really well is create drama and story through how the cards work.  Random events, snipers, smoke grenades, off map artillery, heroes showing up at important moments, etc.  This is the stuff that makes CC a compelling game.  The one benefit it may have for you is that it's teachable to non-wargamers (with a bit of work) so depending on who you game with you may be able to convert somebody.  For what it's worth, I was lukewarm on CoH as well, especially after already playing Combat Commander.  I also played around with Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles, which is an absolutely gorgeous game, but even lighter than CC.  It really sounds like ASL is what you're looking for, so I say just embrace it and try and find a way to play what you want."
boardgames,3dxxgq,zz_x_zz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely interested in Combat Commander. Just not sure what to expect. I don't want to play a heavy, chromed up Memoir '44.  Also, how do the Combat Commander expansions work? Part of the allure of ASL is that you can dig SO deep, but the module dependencies are a nightmare because to play what you want you need one overlay that hasn't been printed since 1990. Are any of the CC expansions a necessity? Looks like Pacific is OOP indefinitely."
boardgames,3dxxgq,zz_x_zz,4,Mon Jul 20 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"I never liked Memoir '44 so I can assure you it's not just a chromed up version.  I haven't played Pacific and it will probably be tied up in P500 for a while, but Pacific and Europe are both standalone games and Europe has far more expansions at the moment.  The big expansion for Europe is CC: Mediterranean, which adds new factions like Britain, France and Italy.  It pretty much just expands the whole experience, gives more options and scenarios.  I haven't picked it up yet but a lot of CC: Europe fans consider it an eventual purchase.  After that there is one called Resistance which requires both Europe and Mediterranean and focuses on partisan forces and allows to play insurgent scenarios.  Then there are 6 smaller scenario packs that give new maps and scenarios.  Only one these, New Guienea, is for Pacific and out of the other 5 a couple only require Europe and the others require Europe and Mediterranean.  So the general idea would be to start with Europe and then pickup Mediterranean when you're ready for more variety.  After that it's kind of pick and choose depending on what's available and what scenarios you are interested in."
boardgames,3dxxgq,Bohnanza,3,Mon Jul 20 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"Combat Commander is definitely NOT a ""heavy, chromed up Memoir '44"". It owes a lot more to Squad Leader and Up Front. It's a blast."
boardgames,3dxxgq,Bohnanza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:56 2015 UTC,Cool. That's what I needed to hear. I think my first try is going to be CC:E. Seems like it might be a little easier to get people on-board and heavy enough to keep me interested.

It's quite easy to learn and teach and It's a very exciting game. The rules are extremely well written and when the situations occur when you have to look something up You'll find it instantly.  I am quite new to wargames and CC:E was my introduction. Since then I've bought and played several games, both heavy and light, but CC:E is still my favourite. Both me and my girlfriend agreed that Memoir 44 is not close to being comparable. CC:E is a completely different beast and a far superior game in every sense."

Band of Brothers doesn't have leader powers and plays a bit more realistically than ASL. Also the rulebook is I think 12 pages long.  Band of Heroes is ASL light. Similarities include leaders running around on the map trying to rally, hero creation, and agonizingly long waits for reprints and new modules. The game is fun though and is played in impulses. Each player moves of fires one unit, and then the next player moves or fires one unit. The rulebook is about 20 something pages and each module adds another 3-4 pages of unique rules."
boardgames,3dxxgq,GreyMaus,2,Mon Jul 20 14:04:22 2015 UTC,How light is light with Band of Heroes? I'm not turned off by a lighter game (I like the ASLSK rules well enough) but I AM turned off by weird euro abstractions like Conflict of Heroes' gamey APs.
boardgames,3dxxgq,eagreeyes,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't like Conflict of Heroes either. I really liked the look and the art but I didn't enjoy playing it.  BoH does use a command point mechanism. Depending on the scenario you do get some command point chits at the start of the game and you can use these to reroll a die or move an extra unit, but this is small and not really an integral part of the game. It could be omitted if you wanted to houserule it.  Nothing is abstracted in the game, it  just doesn't exist. If that makes sense. For example, tanks don't fire AP of HEAT ammo. They just fire and it is assumed the crew picked the proper ammo for the target. Also tanks don't ride buttoned up or unbuttoned and they only have a frontward facing arc of fire.  So the rules are simple but they don't add in rules to abstractly and weirdly represent things. Know what I mean?"
boardgames,3dxxgq,giggity_giggity,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:06 2015 UTC,Come and check out Infinity at /r/infinitythegame .   It's a small squad skirmish game based on turns and reactions. It is in a sci-fi themed universe.   The best part of the game is its automatic reaction playstyle. The game has the most interaction I've ever seen in a war game. On your opponents turn you can have your models react to anything your opponents models do within line of fire. If you'd like more information just ask and I'll fill you in.
boardgames,3dxxgq,p4warrior,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"There was a great ASL community around here for a long time and I used to play Red Barricades every week for a long time but that was years ago.  I understand the allure of full blown ASL.  We have CC:E and even though it's not 1,000s of pages of rules, is really fun to play.  Since you don't have complete control of which cards you have for your orders, it adds some tension to the game when your plans start to come apart.  I never really had that feeling playing ASL.  It's a fun game and if you can find someone in your area, you should check it out.  ASLSK is really good and generally available for the ASL fans and seems to have a growing fan base.  You get vehicles, guns and all the ASL toys without all the bloat.  I tried teaching the SK to my son, but he didn't like it and prefers CC:E or Sergeants Miniatures Game over it.  CC:E provides those random events and hand management over the absolute control of your troops in ASLSK.  Sergeants has been a blast to play, but I think it would be too light of a game for you based on your initial post.  It's a squad sized skirmish game with unique soldiers and a simplified and elegant rule system.  It does have a few issues with the rules where there are gaps or loopholes, but that is getting better as the system matures.  I don't know what your playgroup is like, but if you pick up some of the lighter fare, you might be able to get it on the table more often.  Two of the games on my radar are the reprint of Up Front by WarGameStore or something (just google it), and Heroes of Normandie.  Heroes has an interesting hidden activation system that looks good and you can build forces pretty quickly using the template system for reasonable forces for games.  Oh well, enough rambling.... Good luck and let us know what you decide to do."

boardgames,3dxxgq,SolitarySolidarity,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"Band of Brothers was designed by a jaded ASL player who got fed up with all the gamey tactics. He decided to design a system from the ground up that questioned the assumptions of 30 years of tactical wargaming. What you end up with is a system that accurately demonstrates proper World War 2 tactics: fix the enemy with covering fire, then move in to finish them with close combat. All this without the heavy rules overload of ASL & co.   The Kickstarter print run should ship in a few months; in the meantime you can probably get someone's first editions they are trying to offload fairly cheap. Or else Worthington will likely stock the new editions after the KS ships.

boardgames,3e06k1,slow56k,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Thanks for catching that; we were mistaken in that particular mechanic.  It's hard to keep track of so many different board games at times!  What we meant is that Eclipse gives you various ways of mitigating the randomness of dice rolls.  In particular - from a player's point a view, being able to utilize an upgrade to increase the chances of a successful hit on a ship  is something that should be considered for more serious strategy-related games.  Furthermore, the limited roll of randomness in Eclipse keeps a good amount of uncertainty - keeping the game exciting and fresh.    Again, thanks for catching that; we will correct the blog post to reflect your point."
boardgames,3e06k1,slow56k,3,Mon Jul 20 23:35:03 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Many games do this already.

I will agree with /u/unpronouncableSA that the article was not about RNG and Game Design, but more about a very limited aspect of randomness in a very limited context.  Also, the examples cited were limited and don't reflect a comprehensive view of board gaming randomness.  No where were the dice pools of games like Arkham/Eldrtich Horror discussed.  No where did I see contested dice rolls like Risk discussed.  No where did I see war game styled tables discussed (there a ratio of attack to defense determines which results column to be used).  No where were card mechanics discussed.  No where were was cube tower drops discussed, like in Wallenstein or Amerigo.  At most, this is just a very cursory look at the topic.  A good layman's first look, but it lacks the depth and rigor of thought that I would expect out of a serious more scholarly analysis - the scholarly analysis that the title suggests."

boardgames,3dy2by,faintpremonition,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly not debating, but what part of the game did you feel has a ""tiny bit"" of luck? Maybe I overlooked something. There is no randomness that I'm aware of or at least that I can think of... I guess aside from the the first rounds turn order, but I'm not aware of any game that doesn't at least have that.   I even love that the combat is luckless. Everyone has the same cards, no dice rolling, so you need to try to anticipate what your opponent might play based on previous actions and their current situation."
boardgames,3dy2by,Wisecow,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:29 2015 UTC,The DI cards constitute a luck element.

boardgames,3dy2by,Wisecow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"First round turn order and DI cards draw is luck based.  Turn order doesn't have to use luck, for example Game of Thrones 2ed has preconfigured turn order based on which faction, or Netrunner where Corp always goes first.   Again, it's a tiny bit of luck, and not even meant as a criticism. I think games are more fun with a little luck because exploiting windfalls, and minimizing disasters is part of good play."

boardgames,3dy2by,KumbajaMyLord,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"I don't hate it, but I think there are much better bluffing games.  My main criticisms for Mascarade are    Two out of three actions are not fun/useful. Checking your own cards is boring and doesn't get you any closer to winning. Switching roles is the required setup for making the game interesting, but is itself not really fun and doesn't bring you closer to victory - You don't really get that much of a bonus if you trick someone into announcing the wrong role. The only action that is fun is announcing your card and that is only fun if someone else has sacrificed their turn of having fun by switching your card.  You can't block someone without revealing both cards. That undoes a whole lot of switching and restores a lot of information. There is no way to double-bluff so to speak, because there is no interaction between the roles, there is no Contessa to block the Assassin like in Coup.   Those two things together make the game run really slow and uneventful most of the time I have played it, because there is so little incentive to switch roles unless you have to do it to block someone from winning (which again is not fun) and the chaos and confusion doesn't last long enough."
boardgames,3dy2by,Dominus_Anulorum,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting. People i play with switch all the time. You might do it to take that power for yourself or to deny it to someone else. A lot of cards force switching as well, which helps keep the confusion going. And woke blocking does reveal both cards, it also makes you a target for others who might want your card (if it's good). You also can no longer bluff and several cards can't win the game on their own.  I do see your criticisms, but for whatever reason they have never been an issue with the people I have played with."
boardgames,3dy2by,KumbajaMyLord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:38 2015 UTC,"Well, yea you have to switch, but that doesn't make switching a fun move.  As I said, it's not a terrible game, but for my groups it fell mostly flat because there is no real momentum or development of suspense."

Lost Legacy: The Starship, Δ = 4.41 - I really didn't like this game. The elimination of it wasn't very enjoyable. The meta-game never developed.

It can be a little mathy but it has great player interaction (for a euro) and the theme while a little dry is at least well fitted to the mechanics.

I could recommend a GMT COIN series game like Fire in the Lake for 1-4 players but if you aren't into abstracted historical counter insurgency games then it does not good.  I could recommend Pandemic with On the Brink and maybe In the Lab for 1-5 or 1-6 players or 2-3 teams of up to 6 players but if you aren't into that style of game, then it probably wouldn't work.  I could recommend Agricola or Nations but if you aren't into ""beat your own score"" solo play then they would fall flat.  I could recommend Historia but for 1-6 players but if you aren't into europarch games that use an AI deck (""civbots"") to simulate other players in this abstract civilization game then it wouldn't work.  I could recommend Eldritch Horror for 1-8 but if you aren't into ameritrash narrative games with lots of die rolling and probabilistic thinking then you'll probably dislike this.  I could recommend many hex-and-counter wargames, but if you have no wargamer blood in you or don't like playing a solo game against yourself you won't like it.  I could recommend Bios Megafauna if you can find a reasonable priced copy or backing the High Frontier kickstarter, but if you aren't into Phil Eklund/Sierra Madre Games science based style of games then you'll hate this.

I'd choose based on theme and difficulty you want.  Want an easy game and something that is set in the underground lava tubes of the fantasy world?  Drizzt.  Want a hard game or Dracula styled theming?  Ravenloft.  Want to go up against a dragon?  Ashardalon.  Want to delve into a region where you have elementals and priests, or want the option to have a campaign?  Elemental Evil.  I started with Drizzt and there is one diappointment - the tiles are labeled ""cavern"" and thus can't be mix and matched with other games.  I now have Wrath, as I buy when they are on sale - at least the monsters can be mixed together from these sets."

It makes you smile when something ludicrous happens that ruins the game, the randomness gives you joy. On the other hand, if it wasn't something you grew up with, the show is jarringly bad - terrible clunky acting, stupid random events and the unpleasant feeling the whole time that you are missing something significant.  Eldritch is streamlined, sure, but it plays better. It can appeal to folks who had no experience with it prior to. It has its own problems, but the majority of those are minor. It's challenging and crazy and maintains a lot of the lovecraftian fun.  If you plan on slowly and carefully becoming intimate with a game (to switch metaphors again), Arkham might work really well for you. Don't overindulge in the expansions, play a millionty games and take your time with it. It might reward you. If you want a game you can just go ahead and play with your friends straight off, Eldritch is the winner I think. With the caveat that the first small box expansion is borderline necessary. It adds a lot to the game without making things overly complex."
boardgames,3dyrez,gwailo777,6,Mon Jul 20 17:50:20 2015 UTC,Eldritch. I have played both. Eldritch felt way more streamlined but didn't lose the HP Lovecraft depth. Arkham felt clunky and fiddly at times and super heavy. Eldritch feels better all around imo. But the hardcore HP fans really enjoy Arkham.
boardgames,3dyrez,bodhibell02,5,Mon Jul 20 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"One of the metrics by which I judge games is ""Does everyone playing have fun?"" In that regard, though I deeply loved Arkham for years, I think Eldritch comes out on top. It's vastly easier and quicker to teach people, and takes usually much less time to set up. I've also noticed that usually people pick up on the rhythm of the game within two rounds or so, whereas Arkham often left all but the most hardcore-gamer of my friends baffled for most of the game. Unless you've got a group of people totally into big, slogging games (which can be a blast) I'd strongly recommend Eldritch."

But for a new player that hasn't tried either, and isn't familiar with this type of board game, I'd recommend eldritch horror over arkham horror. You can consider arkham horror to be like a novel, and eldritch horror to be the movie adaptation of it, if that helps. Eldritch horror will play better as a game, but you may find yourself more emotionally invested in arkham horror."

If you get to the point where you've figured out Eldritch Horror's patterns and it loses its challenge or you start looking for a similar game with more depth, I'd recommend moving to Arkham Horror.  There's enough of an overlap between Eldritch Horror and Arkham Horror that picking up on the more nuanced and tedious mechanics of Arkham Horror wouldn't take long at all after getting to know Eldritch Horror.  The real difference between the two games is the atmosphere.  In Eldritch Horror it's clear you're facing a global threat as you're racing around the world piecing together the mysteries of what's happening and how terribly the shit's about to hit the fan.  In Arkham Horror the shit has already hit the fan, and you're (typically) in full on crisis management mode in one city trying to stop the end of the world at the last second.  I love both of the games a lot, and play them with friends whenever I get the chance to break them out.  Eldritch Horror has started to see a lot more play time because of shorter set up, tear down, and game play times, but Arkham Horror is the one my group still likes more.  We have a lot more stories about the last possible turn style wins in Arkham Horror than we do in Eldritch Horror, but we have a lot of fun with both.  By all means start with Eldritch Horror, and remember that Arkham Horror is looming in the distance for you whenever you're ready for it."
boardgames,3dyrez,stlobus,4,Mon Jul 20 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"Let me actually go into some detail that others are skipping over.   Arkham has 5 phases.   Upkeep Movement/Combat Arkham Encounters Other World Encounters Mythos   Eldritch has 3 phases   Actions (2 per player) Combat/Encounters Mythos   Eldritch effectively takes upkeep and movement and combines them into one easier phase with a bit more choice that can be made. It removes the ""other world"" encounters phase and just keeps all encounters as one phase. Every player gets one encounter, and can choose among various encounters. Eldritch also moves combat into the Encounter phase, which tends to be a bit cleaner as far as player turns go.  The goal of Arkham is always the same. You win by closing and sealing 6 gates or by closing every single gate on the board and each player having a gate trophy. Ancient ones change how certain monsters behave, or add extra obstacles that occur throughout the game. You typically lose by having too many gates open or by too many doom tokens appearing on the ancient one track and then losing to the ancient one.  The goal of Eldritch changes based on the ancient one, but essentially you have to complete 3 mysteries. Each ancient one has 4 mysteries in the base game. They are similar in a way, but play out slightly differently. For example: some require you to kill specific monsters, some require you to gather clues and use them in specific ways, others require you to go gate hopping. You typically lose by letting the doom track hit 0, and then losing to the ancient one.  Arkham has a lot more depth to it as you start getting into expansions. Comparing what you can get right now in Arkham to what you can get right now in Eldritch, Arkham takes the cake. Arkham has the base game, 4 big box expansions, and 4 small box expansions.  Eldritch has 1 small box and 1 big box expansion, with a 2nd small box coming out in the next few weeks.  Both Arkham and Eldritch have a pretty light base game. It'll be enough to get you through 3-4 games, but you'll quickly start rehashing encounters and metagaming locations. This is fixed in Eldritch by buying the first small expansion, Forsaken Lore, which I almost consider to be a required expansion. With Arkham I'd either recommend getting Lurker at the Threshold or King in Yellow to give a bit more variables to the encounters without adding too many new mechanics."
boardgames,3dyrez,frozen-solid,5,Mon Jul 20 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"To piggyback off of what the rest are saying, I personally prefer Ark ham because of how much more in depth it is and how customizable it is. With all the expansions Arkham has, you definitely pick and choose how you want to play it. Eldritch for me can get stale quickly because it's the same game each time just different events happening.   Also to go with that, Arkham is a difficult game but I've never felt like I've lost a game of Arkham because of random chance or reasons out of my control. Eldritch, however, is just mean in the fact that you can just get screwed over by a random effect and lose without any chance to recover. It is also just in general a harder game.  Overall they are good and really based on what you want. Do you want customizability and more in depth play? Or do you want an easy streamlined game that you can jam out with out fuss?"
boardgames,3dyrez,orangestegosaurus,4,Mon Jul 20 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Eldritch for me can get stale quickly because it's the same game each time just different events happening.    I agree that the base game of Eldritch has the potential to get stale (although I never felt that way about it).  However, the expansions, Forsaken Lore and Mountains of Madness, significantly increase the game's replayability.  Furthermore, when comparing the two, Arkham is significantly easier than Eldritch. The random chance that you dislike in Eldritch actually makes the game enjoyable and exciting.  Arkham is too predictable and simple.  The challenge in Eldritch makes a victory feel well earned."
boardgames,3dyrez,AGlassOfMilk,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much of the two expansions yet outside of just mashing the cards together, but I expect the Antarctica board to help replayability. It's also not that I dislike the random chance perse but more of the fact that the random chance has much more stricter consequences that often times cannot be overcome. It's very easy to just have a scenario where you're winning and then a dice roll or random card just makes you lose and you can not dig yourself out of the hole. I'm certainly not hating on it, just saying I prefer Arkham more."
boardgames,3dyrez,orangestegosaurus,4,Mon Jul 20 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think Forsaken Lore adds more replayablity.  It adds a significant number of new mysteries and encounter cards.  However, you are right that sometimes random chance plays too much of a factor.  For example, one of the mystery cards (I can't remember which one) cancels a completed mystery.  I have seriously considered removing it from the box."
boardgames,3dyrez,AGlassOfMilk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"That crappy card has the ""hard"" symbol on it. Use that to adjust the difficulty of the deck. I like to somewhat ""stack"" the deck, adding two easy cards in the first half, and two hard cards in the last half."
boardgames,3dyrez,ignisphaseone,3,Tue Jul 21 08:15:31 2015 UTC,"I feel that since Arkham has 10 years of expansions while Eldritch has only been going for 2 years. With the 3rd expansion coming out soon, the feeling of complete customization that you get with AH will not be far behind with EH.  It is kind of like getting in to a LCG while it's been running for years. Unless you're willing to drop 500-1000$ you're always going to be behind the curve.  It might be more manageable to play EH now and easier to keep up with the expansions that will inevitability  be coming."
boardgames,3dyrez,604COOK,3,Tue Jul 21 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"Thematically Arkham Horror is your Classic lovecraftian horror. It's a localized encounter, things are weird, and then heroes have little chance.   Eldritch Horror is more like Hellboy and the BPRD. The world is in trouble and only one team can stand against the paranormal creatures and otherworldly portals that threaten to tear our world apart. And one guy specializes in punching monsters in the face."
boardgames,3dyrez,JoshManVGH,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished Eldritch Horror. I've only played about half a game, but I still say that I preferred it to Arkham. The main problem with Arkham is that it's very complicated and there's a lot of pieces. It takes a long time to both set up and clean up. It was even worse because I was the one doing all the upkeep (moving the monsters, revealing the cards, opening the portals, etc.) Eldritch felt much simpler and easier to do."
boardgames,3dyrez,frozen-silver,5,Mon Jul 20 21:03:24 2015 UTC,Unless you are extremely hardcore I would think most people would argue that eldritch is the better game.
boardgames,3dyrez,zetaspawn,5,Mon Jul 20 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"I own both, and regularly have people over to play games.  Of our gaming group, all who have played both would rather play Arkham.  While it certainly is a bit more complex, it feels more engaging and thematic, and lets be clear, without theme these games don't play well.  What kind of gamer are you? There's no right or wrong answer, but most people will prefer one or the other.  Winning or losing I have more fun with Arkham."
boardgames,3dyrez,demosthenes83,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Arkham myself, but my friend who got me into Eldritch played Arkham before it and told me not to bother with it. His primary reasoning was that it was ""too fiddly"" and he cited the way damage is calculated as a major frustration. If something takes damage and doesn't die in Arkham, its as if no damage was dealt at all and in Eldritch the damage stays (example: deal 3 damage to a creature with 5 hp, in Arkham it will be at 5 hp next turn but in Eldritch it will have 2 hp left)."
boardgames,3dyrez,rubyvr00m,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:21 2015 UTC,"Arkham was the game that got me interested in board games to begin with. Having said that I prefer Eldritch.  The main difference is that you can enjoy a game of Eldritch in the evening, whereas Arkham takes almost a full day to play."
boardgames,3dyrez,DarthLordi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"Remember that fiddliness can equal ""fine grain control"" and ""interesting decision making.""  In Arkham Horror I get to earn money and visit shops, choose 2 hands worth of gear in combat, choose to favor paired skills over its antithesis (speed/stealth, will/strength, luck/lore), watch monsters move about city street, see the terror grow (with allies fleeing town and stores closing), and spend a few turns venturing through a gate into another world.  I love it.  With Eldritch Horror I make influence rolls in cities to gain assets, have unique research events to gain clues, catch steam ships and sail around the globe, go on unique expeditions, and solve mysteries that relate to the evil ones.  I also love it.  In the end, the better choice is dependent on which experience you want - a global adventure with a hard time limit and mechanics designed to make the flow during play, or a crunchy and detailed thematic system that knows and will mess you over?  For a new player, it depends on experience, but almost universally I recommend Eldritch Horror first."
boardgames,3dyrez,mdillenbeck,3,Mon Jul 20 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"Eldritch is a better game.  Almost everyone that has played Eldritch after playing Arkham has stopped playing Arkham entirely.  Everything that Arkham has going for it, Eldritch matches or does better."

A short while after, I played Eldritch and had such a significantly better time that I sold my copy of Arkham. Yeah, Arkham is ""bigger,"" but Eldritch just crams a lot more relevant gameplay into half the time. It's a much richer, more fulfilling experience in my opinion."

We have a two page document for Arkham Horror, Zombicide, Pathfinder ACG, etc... not always even complex games.  It sometimes takes us 6 or 7 play-throughs of a game before we're sufficiently confident we played every rule correctly. Sometimes we even clarify a rule that makes the game too easy or we find a mistake we made that we actually prefer over the rule so we just keep it as a house rule for next time."

You are learning a new system of things and how they work, so you have to be ready to make mistakes, that is how we learn. Don't get bogged down.

It is your standard co-op where you're basically just running around putting out fires (figuratively), trying not to get overwhelmed, until you can accomplish your main objective.  There are, unfortunately, too many of those type of games (Pandemic, Flash Point, Defenders of the Realm, Forbidden Island/Desert....).  It is unfortunate that the theme is a turn-off for me, because I think this game is actually better (mechanically) than most others in the genre.  The whole man-hunt story arc while trying to gather clues and keep gang activity down, while still responding to other crimes is actually quite engaging in a way that I feel other games fall short.  Now that you've got me thinking about it again, I kinda want to give it another go.  So, that's saying something."
boardgames,3dz8wf,Grey-Ferret,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed the few plays of it that I've had. I have the 1st edition and though there were a few errors on the board and a rule book that was lacking, they have resolved those issues. I enjoy playing it solo, and with others. I have yet to play with the ""Dirty Cop""  variant though, nor the Heat expansion.  The theme, for me, was exactly what I was looking for. The crimes can get out of hand quickly if you spend too much time trying to gather the homicide evidence. I think I'll grab the upgrade pack with the new Kickstarter. Shipping to Canada costs almost as much as the upgrade, so it looks like I'll have to ship it to the U.S. And pick it up.  Overall an enjoyable, thematic co-op, that is easy to learn but not a gateway game."

boardgames,3e13xj,Grunherz,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"So, I really enjoyed the game, I played about half of the 'campaign' with my girlfriend. We both enjoyed it. I'll try to hit the pros and cons we had. (Some of this has to do with us just not having a lot of time for board games anymore)   Things I liked:  Movement and combat are really neat, I enjoyed the monsters triggering if you moved in their line-of-sight.  Minis are gorgeous. Almost all of the pieces are cute, I love the teeny cards too.  Neat variety of weapons, spells and items, can really customize your characters to how you want them pretty well.  Things I didn't like:  Most rounds take a really long time, even longer if you PvP even a little bit. All of the scenarios have a PvP goal in the list of goals, of which you need to get 2(3?). So you will probably be beating up your friends. Which is fine, except that's all it turns into. You're pretty much always in line of sight of your opponents, and you always want to hit them first because you'll wonder if they're gonna fight you, make you respawn, etc. I'm sure you could just make it pure co-op, which we didn't try, but I worry it would make it too easy.  Set up takes a little time, but its a mini's game with tiles, so you know what you're getting into.  I guess the PvP was my biggest complaint, but we probably could've just taken out PvP and had more fun with it. I really do enjoy the game, however. Most of me wanting to sell it comes from a big game collection, and no time to play much of anything. Let me know if you have more specific questions!"

It's not high strategy, and it's not even really that well balanced, but the theme and flavor text bring me back to the game every time.  It's the type of game that will often heavily favor one team over the other depending on the scenario, but the rare victories can be very rewarding.  For the kids, my sister and her 8yo son are very fond of Ticket to Ride.  That was my gateway game for them, and it worked like a charm.

When release time came up, there had been no posts for two months. Then all of a sudden, they posted saying they had to change printers.   Then, the other day, they said there was a delay with the printer, as well, I believe, where people who ordered a playmat weren't going to get the game for another month. They've since agreed to ship the game now and ship the mat later."

boardgames,3dxciu,bboomslang,5,Mon Jul 20 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"well, the thing is: the first edition of Shadowrift is a bit long during the middle game. You have a nice ramp up at the start, so that part is fun and risky, but then you get to a plateau where you actually overpower the monsters and mostly wait for the game to really end. There is not much tension anymore. That's why Shadowrift mostly stays in my cupboard, because for the length of setup it is not enough tension for me.  And I don't see anything in the 2nd edition helping with this problem. It's why I didn't back it."

I love back-stabby games like Cutthroat Caverns, but some of the people I play with don't like it, and they'd never get it.    If you've pledged it, but you're on the fence about it, then it seems that you don't really care that much about it.  If you don't care about it, then scrap it.  If you really do want it, then quit asking someone else to make the decision, and keep it.  This is kind of a cop-out, where if we tell you to keep it, and you end up not liking it, it's not your own fault, because we're the ones who convinced you to keep it.

The 2nd edition KS rectifies everything wrong with the 1st edition; the cards are standard sized so they'll work with future expansions, the art is updated so it will match, there's a board (okay, only in the deluxe edition, but still), the coins are tokens instead of cards, and the rules are polished.  I think it's worth it overall; the designer seems like a nice, genuine chap from his posts on BGG. It's a shame it's Game Salute, but they do appear to be (slowly) shaping up. But I can understand if you're not getting it because you got the 1st edition and are annoyed at buying it again, or you want to wait to see how it goes at retail."

Although, I might have to check on setups for games that change based on player count.  Such as starting money/resources for different numbers of players.  My group usually looks to me to be the teacher when it comes to explaining games to new players.  Even games I don't own, if I'm familiar with them.  Whenever I get a new game I always set it up and do a solo play-through, then read the rule book cover-to-cover, then possibly another play-through if something isn't clicking.  I like to make sure I fully understand a game before bringing it to the group."
boardgames,3dznz8,Grey-Ferret,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Over 100 games in my collection with almost 100 expansions.  I'd say about 10-15% of them I could teach without looking at the rulebook, and maybe bluff my way through 25% to 40% of it.  There are some games I haven't learned, and a good chunk just require a quick refresher to remember how to play.  Of course, most of the rules I know are simple or for games I play a lot.  For example, I just picked up Camelot: The Build and Cavemen: The Quest for Fire ($10 on amazon for such beautiful claymation styled artwork?  I'm sold) - both of those are so simple that I already know and can teach them.  For the challenges I use in Pandemic with On The Brink and In the Lab and State of Emergency I don't need to look at the rules - I have over 100 games of that played.  I also really enjoy Brass and have those rules down from regular play.  Remember, when learning it isn't all about frequency of play - its about a learning reinforcement schedule.  You'll remember rules better if you learn it, play it within a couple of days, and then within a week, than within a month, and so on.  Just when you are on the verge of forgetting, pull the game down and play it - reinforce what you learned and if it was a struggle to remember then play it sooner.  Of course, as a collection grows the mechanics can get muddled.  Having one worker placement game means it was a novel experience that will stick out in your memory.  Having 20 different worker placement games with variations on how it works will muddy the rules (was this the one where you place the workers and then pull them to get the benefit, or one of the ones where you get the benefit as you place - that sort of thing).  A prime example of this would be Calandale - he plays so many wargames and churns out videos that I suspect he generalizes to what feels right, and you will hear him say that he plays what feels right rather than nitpicking over the rules even if it is wrong.  He's played enough to understand the common mechanisms, does a quick rules read, and then plays the best he can - but could he teach even 20% of his games without rules and get them 100% right?  Probably not."

It's a judgment on my part, but I feel like folks that don't like Agricola don't feel like putting in the time and playthroughs it takes to learn how to time your turns effectively and play productively.   It's a game that takes practice.   (btw saying there's no player interaction and tons of luck is just crazy talk. A player who plays better will beat a player who plays poorly by not blocking and getting in the way of their opponent(s).)"

boardgames,3dysk7,3th0s,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the 'sequels' to Agricola, which are apparently updated and slightly improved mechanics set in different themes. That said, I absolutely love agricloa! It is a very challenging game with a very high skill cap, requires planning a strategy and simultaneously playing a flexible style around the moves of others. Some games it feels like you're playing against the game itself and struggling to feed your family, other games the whole table is clicking and you'll get very competitive 30-40 point scores.  My favorite thing about Agricola is that it has an extremely flexible skill cap. When you first play you'll have an easier rulebook with family style rules. Eventually you'll break away from that and the game becomes more difficult, and competitive with your group. Now it's time to graduate to one of the opening hand mechanics. For quicker games you can play the '10 improvements and 10 occupations, discard 3 of each'. For longer more competitive ones you'll play with a full draft of occupations and improvements. This lets you have great cards and work towards powerful combos. Once you've got the hang of this, then you'll graduate to more complicated decks of cards (I and K decks!). Finally once your crew is adept at that, you can buy an expansion for the cards to spice it up even more. Buy the competitive card set!  If you like feeling rewarded by improving at a game slowly over time, then Agricola is a perfect choice. If you're looking for high replay value, this is a great game. You mentioned family, so I'd only recommend this game for kids over the age of 13.   Last, the only people I've ever met that didn't like Agricola are the ones who only played it once or twice, and felt frusterated by the mechanics and steep learning curve. If your group is able to plow through ~4 games then you'll be hooked!"

boardgames,3dysk7,Luke_Matthews,5,Tue Jul 21 04:57:34 2015 UTC,Personally I like Caverna over Agricola.  They are both essentially the same game but Agricola is a lot less forgiving.  Problem is there are more fiddly bits in Caverna and it costs more
boardgames,3dysk7,BlueSapphyre,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"I'll second this, for the most part.   We recently bought Agricola because we found it for super cheap. We really loved it. A few weeks later, a friend brought over Caverna.  We intend to buy Caverna as well, but had we known what we know now when buying Agricola, we probably would've put that money toward Caverna instead.   Let me be clear: both of them are fantastic games. Caverna, though, is correctly characterized as ""Agricola 2"". It's a bit more fiddly in terms of setup, but it alters many of the unforgiving mechanics of Agricola while maintaining the same feel and style of competition."
boardgames,3dysk7,Greedybogle,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"My only issue is the static setup, which makes every game feel the same. It definitely needs an expansion that introduces some variation."
boardgames,3dysk7,StephanieRidiculous,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"Seconded! Caverna plays just a little smoother, and adds elements like Adventuring that add some character to the game."
boardgames,3dysk7,HeroOfLight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I like Caverna more - more options, more creativity, more valid winning strategies. It's a little more to bite off as beginner gamers - but worth the effort. But, I also agree - Agricola is a great game, too."

Play with the family rules and you should be fine.  Other suggestions (lighter games): Lords of Waterdeep, Stone Age, 7 Wonders, Puerto Rico"

boardgames,3dysk7,BlueSapphyre,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty ridiculous dismissal of a wide range of taste based on a bad-faith characterization. Catan is a fine game, and it was a revelation the first time I played it, but it was designed decades ago. Game designers and players have learned a lot since then. Same with Agricola. It's the ancestor of the worker placement genre, but it's dull in comparison to modern games. And the reloading of all the different actions every turn is ridiculously fiddly and time-consuming. Archipelago and Tzol'kin are both worker placement games that frankly do more interesting stuff than agricola mechanically, IMO.  I also think it's a bit much to sneer at ""zombie dragons"" in literally the same comment in which you recommend lords of waterdeep."

Some people enjoy the challenge of needing to get xyz done while mitigating disaster constantly; we definitely didn't. When you say you want a ""fun"" game, it's just a matter of what you find fun.   It's also imo a big step up in complexity from Carcassonne, Catan, and Pandemic. When I first tried to learn Agricola, I made it through one page of the rulebook before throwing it back on the shelf just to collect dust for a year. Granted, once it all clicks, it's not difficult to teach others. It was just very new to us.   With the games you mentioned in your collection, I think Ticket to Ride and Takenoko would be great next choices if you think you'd prefer something more relaxed."

boardgames,3dysk7,AndrewRogue,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Agricola is a great game.  I don't agree that it has ""alot of luck"" as long as you draft.  That being said, your intuition drove you here to question the purchase.  I think you should listen to that intuition.  For my money, if you are looking for a step up in euro game difficulty that can be played with your family, I would suggest Tzolk'in.  The gears are not simply a gimmick, they are a fun way to introduce you to heavier worker placement games.  You will have fun placing your workers and playing the game from the first moment, but it will not become stale quickly."
boardgames,3dysk7,Erdumas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:44 2015 UTC,but it will not become stale quickly.   The expansion really ramps this up by mitigating Big Corn from the start. But you can also use the variant where you bid corn for first player.
boardgames,3dysk7,BlueSapphyre,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"Agricola is a deep game, but it's a significant step up in complexity from the games you listed. If they have no experience with worker placements, I'd suggest something else.  Suburbia is a great tile placement game (a step up from Carcassonne)."
boardgames,3dysk7,BlueSapphyre,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"I am... not sure I can recommend Agricola based on that. Not only is the game MUCH heavier than your other titles, but it is a game that, moreso than a lot of others, feels very bad when you're playing poorly. If you don't understand how to feed your family, then you will have a very bad time, and even when you do understand, you still have to find ways to actually develop your farm.  If you do want a game like this, I'd consider Caverna which plays very similarly, has a similar weight, but is far less punishing about feeding your family."
boardgames,3dysk7,BlueSapphyre,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:35 2015 UTC,"I greatly enjoy Agricola. It's difficult. I enjoy the feeling of worry as I wonder if I'll be able to feed my family (now that someone has taken the move that was the lynchpin in my plan) and finding a way to do it. I feel terrible if I let my family starve and we have to go begging.  But; I don't play Agricola to win. I'm not trying to score the most points. I'm just trying to feed my family and build a good farm. This has the side effect of usually netting a good amount of points. I think Agricola would be less fun if you don't get into the role playing aspect. If you don't feel legitimately bad that you didn't have enough cardboard discs to ""feed"" your wooden discs come harvest, Agricola is probably not the game for you.  Now, Agricola does not have player interaction like Catan and Pandemic, but it's about on the same level as Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride (which, if you're looking for a new game... That might be another one to consider), or literally any other worker-placement style game.  It can also take a long time to play. It's supposed to take 30 minutes per player, and that's if everyone is playing well and making decisions in a reasonable amount of time. This doesn't always happen, and for your first games it will probably add another 15 minutes per player, at least. And that doesn't include set-up time, which can be another 15 - 30 minutes, unless you have an insert or resource tray or something.  There is a luck component where if you get a bad draw of cards at the beginning, it can be very difficult to merely subsist while another player sits like a lordly tajiri, food piling over in excess in his storehouse. But there are also rules variants which address this, allowing hands to be redrawn or drafted.  All that being said, I think Agricola is great, and my family enjoys playing it too. But it does have a lot of components (really, just a bunch); depending on what your family vacation consists of, I don't know if I would recommend it. If you're going to a cabin or something which has a big area for a playing surface, sure go ahead. If you're going in an RV or someplace that doesn't have a nice big (steady) playing surface, then you might run the risk of losing pieces.  Ticket to Ride also has some space limitations, as does Power Grid and Concordia (also both fun games, a little bit more like Catan, but also wildly different)."

boardgames,3dysk7,Erdumas,2,Tue Jul 21 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"I looked alot on the internet and agricola looks like a fun game, but it also has alot of bad reviews about it being boring with no interactions with other players and with alot of luck.   There is very little luck and a ton of player interaction. The main mechanism is action blocking, going where you think your opponent wants to go to deny them the action. Resources are very tight in the game, so choking someone out of reed will prevent them from expanding their house, for example.   The bad reviews are going to be coming from the Amerithrashers who like games where you tear down each others progress. It's well loved within most of the community, holding the #1 game on BGG for a quite a while.   Will I like it if I like carcassonne, catan and that type of games?   It's going to be heavier than those games. Feeding is really tight, and starving is very punishing. But I find a sense of fulfillment when I win because of how difficult is can be to navigate the game. If I could play it more often, it would be my #1 game, but it's currently sitting at #4 because my gf doesn't enjoy it as much."

boardgames,3dysk7,vazzaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I personally don't. But my gf does. Mostly because it's much less stressful. In Agricola, starving is -3 points and when a game usually comes down to 1-2 points, losing 3 points can immediately take you out of winning the game. It's incredibly punishing in that way.   The Village however is much more forgiving, you're not going to get negative points for not doing something. Your workers will age and die, and when they die is important to scoring points. So there's a mad rush to kill of your family as quickly as possible to secure points."
boardgames,3dysk7,vazzaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"Agricola would be a terrible choice for this set of players and for this situation. It is much more complicated than all the games you listed, with many more rules and many more components. It's not like Twilight Imperium, but it would still be a significant jump in complexity.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.  The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.  How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending ""megabucks"". Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.  The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.  This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.

boardgames,3dyr7t,_Arion_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:47 2015 UTC,Mainly has to do with the themes. Creating an empire is a heavy theme and somewhat of a turn-off for casual players. But ill def try 7 wonders soon with a different group of people.

boardgames,3dyr7t,PJ73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:18 2015 UTC,Machi Koro is a little disappointing (I don't own the expansion) and not a patch on Sushi Go. King of Tokyo is light and is simple to learn. Many say King of New York is better - I can't comment but I did choose King of Tokyo for its simplicity.

Having more backers should make the game cheaper, not more expensive, not to mention that additional latecomers make the stretch goals possible."
boardgames,3dxci2,thrainng,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but the idea is to also rewards those who had faith in the game during the early stages of the kickstarter."

If you check out the project now you can see that it's well on its way to reach some of the last stretch goals."
boardgames,3dxci2,Dameofhearts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yeh but it's still a small thank-you for those who backed first and got the ball rolling.    If not, just look at it as a special offer - first in best dressed - which is below retail price. It's not getting progressively more expensive, it's just a special deal for those who are quick enough I guess.    A tonne of projects have ""early bird specials"" and while I'm not a huge fan of it, I don't back enough projects for it to really worry me."
boardgames,3dxci2,nmacholl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's a shame that they made player hero powers mechanic exclusive to KS backers... I don't mind alternate art or names on the box as KS exclusives, but developed and tested mechanics as exclusives hurts retail and those who cannot take advantage of KS. Sad, otherwise it looks like a great game."
boardgames,3dxci2,BabyAzerty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:23 2015 UTC,The faction powers are coming in an expansion. The KS reward is  just a bonus if you want to tinker with it as soon as you get it.

The broad strokes seem similar (Red Larch is the town at the center of the adventure, you fight elementals, lots of traps, etc.), but the flavor text has very little to do with anything other than advancing the storyline of the boardgame.  There's a traitor mechanic in the final mission so I don't know if that might tip anything off for the players in the D&D Tabletop RPG...I've not read that far into the book yet, but early on there's nothing that jumps out at me."

boardgames,3dy6ap,dutch-dutch-dutch,6,Mon Jul 20 14:27:29 2015 UTC,Maybe just get a couple nice boxes to take the few that you need for the evening. Michael's has some inexpensive wooden boxes that would serve this purpose. Unless you're packing Myth.
boardgames,3dy6ap,mixme1,5,Mon Jul 20 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an interesting idea.  My initial thought, maybe re-order your storage to put a complete selection of games into fewer planos. Like, start filling a plano with all the loose bits from your games, and say you fit 4.5 games into that plano. Alright, now take out that half of a game of components. Those 4 games that did fit, put their boards and rulebooks into another container, maybe even like a nice envelope or folder depending on size. Now you can take those 4 games out of the house with only two containers.  Obviously if you wanted to play two games that were not already consolidated in the same box you would have to take 4 containers, or maybe 3 depending on how you ordered the boards and rulebooks."
boardgames,3dy6ap,ninjagamer85,0,Mon Jul 20 17:05:11 2015 UTC,"This.  All my retail boxen are stored in my garage while the games are in Plano boxen with the boards in one and the rules in another. We've managed to put over 30 games into a 1m wide by 2.5m tall shelf using that system. No, it's not as pretty, though it does mean it's easy to grab a game for use or travel.  I think I would go mad if I split the games amongst different boxen. shudder"
boardgames,3dy6ap,Stagnant_Life,3,Mon Jul 20 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing and was surprised how compressed everything became. There were two unpredicted consequences. First, without the art to browse through, games were usually picked that people were more familiar with or that were at the top of our minds. Underplayed games became unplayed games. We put all of our card games together in LCG cases. It was nice to take all the light games somewhere at once. You rarely think 'ugg, why did I bring this copy of bonanza its so heavy and big and unwieldy!' I like to be able to just grab the kits and go. However, they still suffer from the same browsing problem."

boardgames,3dz5s9,Dominus_Anulorum,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"Just from a cursory glance, it looks like you are more skewed toward thematic games (Cosmic, Game of Thrones, etc), so I think Eldritch Horror would probably be in your wheelhouse if you already love all those other games. Kingsburg is a decent game, but the expansion is almost necessary and I think there are a lot of worker placement games that do what Kingsburg does better, even Kingsport Festival which is a Lovecraftian reskin (with some tweaks) of Kingsburg.    I love Five Tribes, it's one of my favorite games, but it's very abstracted with minimal theme. The other games you list tend to be quite thematic (with the exception of Catan), so that might be something to keep in mind."
boardgames,3dz5s9,CoconutPete44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"I do like theme a lot, but I appreciate mechanics. I have gotten to play kingsburg and enjoyed it (plus it was on Sam from dice towers list and our tastes match up very closely), which is why it Is on my list. But thanks for the suggestion!"
boardgames,3dz5s9,mdillenbeck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Eldritch Horror with Forsaken Lore - this will add to your collection and ""epic adventure"" game with the ameritrashy mechanics that are the hallmark of such a game.  Also, I don't see a fully cooperative game in our collection yet and so having one would be a benefit.  Then, when you get the chance, add Mountains of Madness.  One warning: if you don't like the game, then the resale value is low on this (though a trade might get you better value).  You may want to buy it without the expansion and give it a few plays.  Forsaken Lore just add all the missing cards from the base game needed to provide variety for repeated plays, and while I consider it essential it isn't needed for the first couple plays."
boardgames,3dy9pv,Olof_szary,3,Mon Jul 20 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"The car that's ahead should move first. Thus, car #1 that positioned itself 1 space ahead of car #2 should have moved before car #2 in the current turn. Then, next turn, car #1 should move before car #2 and clear the way.    So unless I'm misunderstanding, this situation shouldn't be an issue. I think it could only happen if car #1 was already ahead of car #2 and moved a very short distance (1-2 spaces) such that it's still in the direct path of car #2. That doesn't sound like it's what you're describing here, though."
boardgames,3dy9pv,biohazard930,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think that the drivers were at almost the same position  but the driver on the outside of the corner had higher gear (4) at the start but rapidly reduced it to try to fit the corner ending up just in front of the second driver (rolling 2). The second driver was at gear 3 and was only allowed to drive forward  As I said, it was 2nd game for all of us so maybe we misunderstood the ordering on the corner rules"
boardgames,3dy9pv,AreDubbaYew,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:56 2015 UTC,"What an edge case! Option A is to downshift and skip a gear to 1st (taking -1 Gearbox WP), then follow the rules for a blocked car. Option A comes with a minimum of 2 WP lost, maximum of 4 (including the collision). Option B is to only downshift to 2nd. Option B comes with a minimum of 2 WP lost, maximum of 5, but you will recover faster. Option C is to go suicidal and remain in 3rd or shift up to 4th! The advanced rules for WP loss due to blocked cars is as follows:   If blocked by another car, move forward as far as possible, then count how many spaces the car would have moved if you had not been blocked, and lose the following brake and tire WP:    Spaces Remaining Brake WP Tire WP    1 1 0   2 2 0   3 3 0   4 3 1   5 3 2   6 3 3   7 The car is eliminated      Further, after the blocked car stops it initiates a collision roll (for both cars). Each car makes a roll to determine if any Car Body WP lost (for their own car).  P.s. all the WP lost is ""general"" if following the beginner rules."
boardgames,3dy9pv,biohazard930,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:11 2015 UTC,"In that case, I think the 2nd driver must downshift and burn a bunch of brake points. That'll really take both cars out of the race being in such a low gear!"

I ended up getting the much-expanded-upon tournament rules from (I think) BGG. They are far less ambiguous.  The car in 2nd has to brake as best as they can. If they are not in a low gear, things will go very badly for them.  The car in front just has to roll the collision dice."

boardgames,3dy32k,Ogamitringle,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:04 2015 UTC,"You want most people in scoring territories.  You can increase your people, decrease theirs, increase the strength of your people, decrease theirs, move, wipe out a scoring area, or create a new one. Then there is the option to score, which comes with it a special event card.  That is the whole game.  I don't think it is hard to come up with a strategy at all. It has an inflated weight ranking due to length of game, and difficulty in accomplishing your strategy (you have to make sure you set yourself up to pick a territory to score, so you have to make sure your strategy panned out before the final action of a round. Other people tend to get in your way with that), but the strategy is not the tough part."

boardgames,3dxami,bleuchz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"Dead of Winter is semi-coop with a potential traitor, so bluffing will likely be required.  Even if you're not the traitor, odds are you still have to act somewhat selfish as you all have your own individual goals you need to complete to win the game. So usually everyone acts a bit shifty."
boardgames,3dxami,Lukric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:49:56 2015 UTC,Not OP but  I've had my eyes on this for awhile. I'm a little worried that people will just throw the game if it becomes clear their objectives won't be met. I've had problems with one of my groups while playing Marvel: Legendary in that if certain players thought they couldn't win they would throw away their turns preferring everyone lose together.
boardgames,3dxami,bleuchz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"That's harsh. Luckily for me, my group are mostly good sports, even if they can't personally ""win"".

Some people like to put out the resources so they are easily accessible by all players.  And that's not to mention if you are using one or both of the expansions, which means you have to add in cards you need, and then also need to separate them at the end of the game.

The main difference is that if you make a purchase you can choose to replace the empty spot in the line-up immediately, but in the event that it's a villain with an attack, it affects you immediately.  They call the variant ""On Patrol"" in the rulebook."
boardgames,3dyalv,trayo,3,Mon Jul 20 18:53:58 2015 UTC,Waiting to the end makes sense and this is why.  Many of the other DB's such as Legendary are cooperative.  DC's is mainly competitive.  This limits the amount of VPs available on any given turn.
boardgames,3dyalv,Curiouskender,4,Mon Jul 20 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think this rule helps to balance things.

They sell them in various packs.  If you plan on going the entire time, you'll need a four-day pack.  Sunday is ""family"" day, so the kids (depending on age) will probably have the most fun that day. 3 - Yes, you can definitely go without signing up for events. The vendor floor is the main ""hub"" of activity for GenCon and they'll be plenty of opportunity to check things out and demo stuff. You can also purchase ""generic"" tickets ($2/pop) which can be used to attend the events. 4 - Yes, you definitely will have fun. 5 - I guess the only ""route"" I can suggest is to do some research before hand.  Look at the GenCon event list (which can be quite daunting) and search for stuff you have interest in. Check out ""most anticipated"" lists and, of course, BGG.  HTH."

Our kids (the ones that will be going at least) are 14 and 17, so family day may not be for us.  But we were planning on buying the badges for all 4 days. Even if we don't use them, it seems to be the most economical and even if we decide to break the days and just do half days each day we may do that.  We aren't great with crowds, but we want to go so badly, so this seems the way to go.    Are the prices for games that they release there drastically higher than they are for the public since they are being purchased at an event? Did you notice that? Or do you get a break?"

boardgames,3dxnhf,batemann,12,Mon Jul 20 11:30:36 2015 UTC,"Spies don't have to fail every mission they're on.  If they get on the first mission and pass it, the exact series of events you laid out lets them fail multiple missions while blaming them on the new additions to the teams.  More importantly, the game is about finding out as much information as possible. The first team passing the mission should not give you any meaningful information. Again, having a spy pass the first mission and then failing a future mission should help establish that.  You can also add Merlin/Assassin into the mix, to give the minions another out."
boardgames,3dxnhf,TrjnRabbit,5,Mon Jul 20 12:01:14 2015 UTC,"Spies don't have to fail every mission they're on. If they get on the first mission and pass it, the exact series of events you laid out lets them fail multiple missions while blaming them on the new additions to the teams.   This. Also, in 6- and 7-player games the first mission only consists of 2 people! So if a spy fails this mission, the other person knows for sure he or she is a spy."
boardgames,3dxnhf,PaganBacon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"As I said in my wall-of-text post, this is not automatically a bad thing.  Outing spies is not the victory condition, getting to three points is the victory condition. I have played games with the inquisitor / lady-of-the-lake module where one player looked at the loyalty card of every spy at the table and the spies still won. So that is all the proof I need that ""oops! someone now knows I am a spy"" does not automatically lead to a spy loss.  Even in a 2-player first mission, if the spy failed it that means the resistance has their job cut out for them because they need to win 3 out of 4 to win. That is huge.  I really encourage people to play the Empire Variant more. New players are often confused by how it winds up making the spies win more frequently."
boardgames,3dxnhf,jackelfrink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but looking at OPs comments it seems it caused issues in his/her games. So it's worth reminded the spies in that game the risk you run when you fail a 2-man mission. However, as you say, those risks can pay off, so there isn't a general rule that says ""you shouldn't fail 2-man missions""."

boardgames,3dxnhf,timotab,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Except in a 10 player game, the final mission requires everyone to be good. If you are distrusting the whole team of 3 people that had 2 fails on it, you still have to choose one of those three to put on that final mission."
boardgames,3dxnhf,jackelfrink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"I don't get this variant. Why take away a tool of the spies? Why create a situation (while unlikely) where you could out 2 spies?  Is this supposed to make it easier or harder for the resistance? I'd imagine easier, just because you take away a trick the spies can pull."
boardgames,3dxnhf,apache_alfredo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:06 2015 UTC,I don't get it either - I was just answering the question.
boardgames,3dxnhf,jackelfrink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"Is this supposed to make it easier or harder for the resistance?   Both. Neither.  For experienced or expert players the empire variant helps resistance. For newbie or non-gamer players the empire variant helps spies. (For intermediate, odds are the same.)  The reason it sounds counterintuitive is the tendency of people to assume outing of spies is how you win. This is not true. You win by getting to 3 points. The reason I like the empire variant is because it shows that outing the spies is not the same as getting to three points.  It is unlikely that anything I type here will change your mind. People just have to play it and see for themselves. However the following two points may help. First, think how many close games the resistance wins where one or even two of their points come from a spy bluffing. Take those points away from resistance and giving those points to spies will tip the balance of what team gets to three points first. Secondly, the ""spy trap"" you describe is not the auto-win you make it out to be. It may out the spies to A resistance member, but does not out the spies to all the resistance members. That one all knowing resistance player will find it is not so easy to talk the rest of the resistance into knowing what they know.  People can know who the spies are and not get to 3 points first. People can get to 3 points first and not know who spies are."
boardgames,3dxnhf,jackelfrink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"I get your point, about points. And i guess the variant tries to teach new players how to play the game. Hell, I've had resistance members throw fail because they thought it would trick the spies, despite clearly being against the rules. If players are struggling with mechanics, then perhaps I get it. Perhaps if the spies are always winning - but even then, something is probably in the meta game that needs to be flipped."
boardgames,3dxnhf,timotab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. Something is wrong with the metagame when that stuff happens. Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people because no matter how clearly you explain it, they just quip back ""That is just what a spy would say!"". You have to show them. And the empire variant is the best way I have found to demonstrate it.  The real frustrating one is when you play 5 games of Empire Variant in a row and each and every game winds up 3-0 in favor of the spies, and the greenhorns still insist that spies being outed means an automatic win for the resistance."
boardgames,3dxnhf,apache_alfredo,7,Tue Jul 21 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"..... played roughly six 6-player games and .....  ..... Even if the first team ends up with a spy on it and is failed, the loyal servants always seem to find a team of 3 and carry that team to victory.   Wait? What? I missed this on my first read through.  If the first round fails, resistance needs to win three out of the next four to get victory. Meaning one of either missions three or five need to be a victory. But rounds three and five are four player missions. Even if you are right about three resistance members, there is no way three resistance members can win round three or round five. Those missions require four resistance members, not three.  That is either a typo or you are playing some rule wrong."
boardgames,3dxnhf,jackelfrink,4,Mon Jul 20 13:58:30 2015 UTC,OK THIS is the answer. I was playing by the mission player counts as seen on wikipedia because I left my actual game boards at home. On wikipedia it says six player count is 2-3-3-3-4.   Doh. Good catch.
boardgames,3dxnhf,apache_alfredo,6,Mon Jul 20 15:23:33 2015 UTC,I've fixed the error in the wikipedia page.
boardgames,3dxnhf,soupness,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:16 2015 UTC,Well that certainly changes things!
boardgames,3dxnhf,ruinercollector,9,Mon Jul 20 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"I have used this example before for explaining the same kind of effect in Sheriff Of Nottingham. Maybe it will help here too.  Imagine playing rock paper scissors and complaining that paper always wins. No matter how many times I throw rock, I never can win. My friend suggests that I maybe could try playing scissors sometime. But scissors is so boring. I mean just look at it. It looks like the v-for-victory sign. I dont want to look like a 1960s hippy. Rock is a fist! Strong! Powerful! Heck, even in the non-Avalon version of resistance the sign for the good guys is a fist. I enjoy playing fist. I just wish we could come up with some kind of house rule or something that would make fist more balanced.  Now clearly such reasoning is total nonsense to us outside observers. The problem it demonstrates is that the fun strategy and the winning strategy is not always the same thing.  In The Resistance. Lying to your friends is the fun part. Getting to three points is the winning part. There are times (most of the time actually) where you will need to make a choice. If you do the fun thing it wont win and if you do the winning thing it wont be fun.  Now when the group metagame is tilted against the spies, what I can nearly guarantee you is that the spies think the winning conditions are ""remain hidden"". If they get found out, this feels like loosing. So they avoid any action that would tip their hand. But you don't win the game by pulling off a real amazing bluff. You win the game by getting to three points.  Quick pop quiz. Say you are 99% sure Alex is a spy. You pitch your case to Bob and Charlie. Bob agrees with you. Charlie freaks out saying the accusation is unwarranted and you are needlessly attacking Alex for no reason. Now of Bob and Charlie, who do you suspect is a spy? Well you may argue that ""logically"" a spy would not want one of this brethren spies to get outed, so Charlie bust be trying to protect his fellow spy. This matches the ideas that ""spies must remain hidden"" is the victory condition. But that is not the victory condition. Getting to three points first is the victory condition. So now you may realize this as the trick question it is. Both Bob and Charlie are spies. Bob is a spy too and is willing to throw his fellow spy under the buss to make himself look more trustworthy. Bob is smart and realizes that outing a spy is not a ""loss"" for the spies. He improves his chances of having the rest of the group think he is resistance because he acts like a resistance member should and tries to out spies. This improves his chances of getting placed on a mission and therefore improves the chances of getting points. While I admit that it certainly may be more fun to have spies help keep their fellow spies under cover, thats not the win condition.  So that is one common issue. A second common issue is a spy bluffing in order to ""not get caught"". To give just one easy to understand example, say a spy was on the first mission and fails it then the same spy winds up getting placed on mission two. The ""fun"" way to play is to think you have to keep your identity hidden. If you fail two missions in a row you run a real risk of being outed as a spy. So you bluff. But remember, the goal of the game is to be the first to three points. The goal of the game is not to lie to your friends. You should at least consider the possibility of failing the second mission. If you do, the resistance has to get a perfect three out of three to win. There have been plenty of games where I failed the first two missions and then just flat out admitted I was the spy. Kick back, put my feet up, and let my buddy spy do the tiny amount of work necessary to get a single more point. I have played my part by forcing the game into a situation where resistance has to get a perfect three out of three to win. Now it may feel that being outed should count as a ""loss"" for the spies, but that is not the victory condition.  Now all this advice may be pointless. Maybee you LIKE lying to your friends. Maybee puylliung off an amazing bluff feels cool. Maybee having to keep your cover a secret builds a tension and excitement you get a thrill from. If that is the case, then by all means ignore everything I said and continue to play as if the victory condition was ""pull of an amazing bluff"". If that is what you get enjoyment from doing, then do it. After all, the attitude of ""I don't care if I lose, I just want to have fun"" is the mark of a gracious looser. Just accept the fact that spies are never going to get to three points first and just play that you ""win"" if you can remain hidden the whole game.  EDIT: Wow, I did not realize that was going to be a wall of text. TL;DR is that 'getting to three points' and 'not getting caught out as a spy' are not the same thing."
boardgames,3dydo2,Gunnrhildr,3,Mon Jul 20 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"Well, there's sort of gun stuff in Doomtown: Reloaded. Combat is resolved in shootouts, where you try to form a poker hand from your deck, but the number of cards you draw (and can selectively redraw) is calculated based on the number of bullets in your posse.  There are also a number of supporting cards that are guns."

See, that's another one of them Westerns I mentioned that seems to serve their theme more than the idea of gun combat. A quick look at a game overview shows me that you win through Influence Points and Control.  What I'm looking for specifically is a game where players just straight up shoot each other until only one is left; kind of like a Magic: The Gathering, except with guns."

boardgames,3dydo2,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I've come across it. Again, the mechanics appear to focus on telling the story, rather than on raw combat.  Full disclosure: the M:tG comparison is more than a bit apt. I'm trying to design a dueling CCG/TCG/LCG/whatever similar to M:tG. Just as in Magic, you can have more than two players, and then players are simply eliminated as they lose all life, mine can possibly accommodate more than two at a time, but is really geared towards duels.  Reason I ask in this sub is to find out whether that niche has been filled yet. Depending on the answer, I will either avoid stepping on toes, or step on them really, really hard."
boardgames,3dydo2,bleuchz,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"So you're looking for a more realistic MtG. Nothing comes to mind immediately, but there were a ton of CCGs that came out in the 1990-2000 era. I really enjoyed the combat in the Star Wars CCG from Wizards.

boardgames,3dw25i,cardflopper,3,Mon Jul 20 12:06:30 2015 UTC,My best is probably Love Letter or The Resistance.  My worst is easily Shadows Over Camelot it cost me something like $90 AUD and we never intend to play it again.
boardgames,3dw25i,Arterial-A,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"curious, what about Shadows turned you off ?"
boardgames,3dw25i,JediCheese,3,Mon Jul 20 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"We played it and didn't happen to have a traitor which I'm sure hurt the experience, but there was just nothing compelling about the game.   The no table talk rule was obnoxious, playing poker hands was boring, it never felt like you did anything meaningful on a turn, it went way too long for what it was.  Basically the game just wasn't fun, everyone unanimously hated it which never happens in my group.   I feel like I should give it another shot with a guaranteed traitor, but I also own Battlestar Galactica and I just never see a time I'd pull out Shadows Over Camelot instead of that.   I watched the Dice Tower guys play it live (since they always rave about it) and they all seemed like they had a miserable time (game outstayed its welcome, traitor doesn't really do much especially when revealed), seems like their love for the game is just nostalgia from the fact they played it well before better games came along."
boardgames,3dw25i,CheshireSwift,2,Mon Jul 20 06:45:07 2015 UTC,There's a no table talk rule?  We've ignored it and stuff still goes down...
boardgames,3dw25i,rabit71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:51:50 2015 UTC,"Shadows is quicker than Battlestar, at least? I generally agree, particularly with the traitor not actually doing much. For what it's worth, we ignore the table talk rule. As long as nobody is indicating too concretely what cards they have, people can talk all they like. Wild accusations are half the fun.   I'd still much rather play BSG or Resistance though. Or Blades of Legend from the Level 99 Minigame Collection."
boardgames,3dw25i,UltimateKeeop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:38:41 2015 UTC,"you really need to invest in the theme of the game. I'm unsure what you mean by the no table talk rule, as I'm of the opinion the rules just mean you can't tell players exactly what you have in your hand or what were on the cards you have seen. in my opinion this aids the theme immersion as players end up talking to each other in character along the lines of ""Sir Gawain, I intend to attempt to find the Holy Grail. However, I require assistance. Wouldst thou aid me on my quest?"", ""Alas, Sir Tristan, I cannot help thee for i possess no means to find the grail and am unsure of my favourite colour. I am however a man of widely ranging strength, and if perchance you or any of the other knights of this fine order possess the tiniest of strength we could between us crush the saxons building on our shore. What say thee gentlemen?"", ""I, King Arthur, will aid you on your quest Sir Gawain, as my earlier clairvoyance has made me fear the coming of Mordred to aid the Saxons. Then i shall join Sir Tristan in his quest to see it to its completion."", ""I feel our efforts would be spent on removing catapults, so I shall attempt such"", ""hmmm, that is a suspicious claim, Sir Owain, as we are far from danger on that front. It makes me suspect thee to be impure of heart"" etc etc. Plus Holy grail jokes gallore."

boardgames,3dw25i,Deviver,2,Mon Jul 20 03:02:18 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head:    ONUW comes in at around $1 per session (sessions run around 90min on average), and I have the expansions & paid for early Daybreak shipping (and will again for ONUVampire next month). Sushi Go around 75 cents a game. I'm down to $1 an hour for Fire in the Lake (thats sort of an odd metric, but a valid one). My Glory to Rome set is about $3 a play now (sleeves, custom job, etc) because its played a ton but cost me a pretty penny. I have a set of Wizard cards that probably hovers around a quarter per play, maybe even lower.    Sort of cheating since its new to me, but I'm out (overall, in a convoluted deal) $270 for a single play of Indonesia (but it has been solidly pimped out). This will improve, I'm sure of it..."
boardgames,3dw25i,pvtparts,2,Mon Jul 20 01:26:51 2015 UTC,Don't have an accurate log. but best value:  Pandemic -  Played maybe 20 or so games of this? still need to pickup the expansion but the sales arent coming.  Least value.  Splendor - game just never worked for our playgroup. Gets on the table rarely
boardgames,3dw25i,mysticpickle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"For me, the only game I can really appropriately apply this to is Glory to Rome since I know I keep accurate plays logs for it.   Glory to Rome = $0.81 ($25/41/0.75) (used a guessed average 45 minute games since I play exclusively 2p but it could very well be longer)"

Played it quite a lot with the wife, we've house-ruled an extra turn in to make it longer, and it wasn't hugely expensive even with the expansion.  2nd would be Warhammer Invasion - probably a few more games played, shorter play time, and have spent more on it: core set, couple of deluxe sets, 2-3 battlepacks.  At the other end of the scale is Forbidden Stars as I've only bought it recently and played one game (on my set), but that was a 6 hour game. It's definitely going to see a lot more play - it's just the logistics of getting people together.  Also Race for the Galaxy has only seen one play, I'm hoping once I've had a chance to teach my friends it's something we can use almost as a filler game. It's just that initial hurdle to overcome."
boardgames,3dw25i,Mordarto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:28:06 2015 UTC,"Keep at it with Race for the Galaxy. The iconography is confusing at first, but encourage your friends to make liberal use of the card with all the definitions on it. They'll pick it up. It's a remarkably fun game once it clicks."
boardgames,3dw25i,toristr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:53 2015 UTC,"I personally like to factor average number of players into this. My formula = Cost/plays/time/average people playing  Avalon - $20/5/1/7 = $0.57/player*hours  Eclipse+Expansion - $130/7/5/5 = $0.74/player*hours  Hanabi - $13/5/0.5/4 = $1.3/player*hours   DC Comics Deck Building Game = $42/5/2/3 = $1.4/player*hours  Mage Knight = $90/6/4/2 = $1.88/player*hours  These numbers don't surprise me one bit. Eclipse sees a lot of love in my group, and it's been roughly a month since I picked up Hanabi so I expect it to go down. Mage Knight is recently getting more love around my group as well, so I expect it to go down as well.   DC Comics was my first ""major"" board game outside of Risk, Monopoly, and the like, so I can't say it was the smartest purchase I ever made and it's been a long time since it hit the table, but even at $1.4/player*hours it's not a major loss."
boardgames,3dw25i,Hark_An_Adventure,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:39:30 2015 UTC,Are we learning here that cheaper games = usually easier to teach = get more plays = MUCH better value for money?  Certainly is true in my experience.  But is interesting because usually (and with other products) more expensive items = better bang for buck in the long term...
boardgames,3dw25i,breaking3po,2,Mon Jul 20 12:20:20 2015 UTC,"I think it has a lot to do with cheaper games being, on average, a lot shorter than their more expensive counterparts. It's why Love Letter will almost always have a far better ""value"" than something like Agricola or Mage Knight, although that only holds true if you equate ""value"" with ""money spent"" as opposed to ""enjoyment"" or some other factor."
boardgames,3dw25i,Hark_An_Adventure,2,Mon Jul 20 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think that party games get undervalued because they lack that ""love"" factor. They are fun, but we don't get the adrenaline rush like we might from making a big move in our favourite game.  Perfect example for me is Mage Knight. I get more fun out of it than say Catan. However, these metrics are looking at this from a cold hard statistics POV only. So yes, I am learning that these smaller games are more valuable than I had anticipated."

I played too much of it online so when I finally bought it to play with my SO I knew the game so much better than he did and he didn't enjoy playing with me as much :(  How do people handle games that you have gotten as a gift? I don't want to put in $0 since it's no fun to track that game at that point so I've been doing resell value - does that make sense or does anyone have a better suggestion?
boardgames,3dw25i,zoidberghoneydew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:43 2015 UTC,"I guess this is where keeping track of plays would come in handy, so the best I can do is guess from memory ...  Best cost per play. Probably a tie between Carcassonne and Agricola. In the winter, these get 3-5 plays per week.  Worst cost per play. Well, in 2007 I bought Risk: Transformers on the way to a family event thing because my then brother-in-law was a fan of the movie, and I'll never not like the giddy joy of rolling in Risk. We started setting it up, didn't play, still hasn't been opened again."

Yinsh, Carcassonne, Power Grid, and Cards Against Humanity all come in under $2. Girlfriend loves Yinsh, Carcassonne is easy to get to the table. CAH I've only played 3 times, but each time involves a huge number of people. Power Grid only got played a few times, but each time is a long epic with 4-6 people.  The worst ROI are the 2P games: Tzaar, Dvonn, Jaipur, and Patchwork simply because only 2 people are playing them. My worst ROI on games with >2 players are Agricola (which I play on my iPad) and Keyflower, which I've only gotten to the table 3 times.

(aka Take 5!).   Resistance Avalon is the party game that never fails. Every time we play this, we have to play it at least 5 times because it's so addictive. :p  6 nimmt! is great because it scales well (up to 10 players), the rules are very simple to teach, has low downtime (due to the random nature of the turns) and involve a bit of strategy as well."

A: The order of resolution is Pulse, then Cancel, and finally Finisher. If a Pulse meets a Cancel/Finisher the Pulse is resolved as normal but the Cancel/Finisher doesn't take effect. Instead the Special Action and base cycle to discard 1 and the player has an additional style available for 2 beats. If a Cancel meets a Finisher the Finisher doesn't take effect and the Special Action and base are placed in discard 1 just as if it was a normal attack pair. If two instances of the same Special Action meet each other (and clash in case of Finishers) the Special Action cards are placed in discard 1, the bases are returned to their respective hands and new attack pairs are played just as if a Cancel was played."

boardgames,3dwrxr,feeboo,4,Mon Jul 20 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"The rules hasn't changed very much. There's a bunch of big BGG thread covering that and other things. If you print out the FFG rules you can play your version of the game with its' rules. Any expansion race cards should work, but expansion stuff that adds cards won't.  My advice: get the FFG version. And get the newer one with Parasite on the cover."
boardgames,3dwrxr,pastah_rhymez,4,Mon Jul 20 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"This is the older Avalon Hill edition of the game. Avalon Hill got the rights after Mayfair's print, and, as Scott Nicholson puts it, they decided to ""strip out all the awesome"", reducing the number of players and the number of total aliens.   Fantasy Flight Games re-released the game in 2009 with a streamlined and clarified ruleset and lots of nice bits. They have since been putting lots of expansions and goodness out for it since then, and from what I can tell, the FFG edition is the edition of CE to own (as of this writing).   Having said that, I'm not an expert on CE, and you may be able to ""upgrade"" your version. If not, and if you have the capacity, I'd recommend picking up the FFG version."
boardgames,3dwrxr,nakedmeeple,2,Mon Jul 20 10:51:31 2015 UTC,"This is Avalon Hill in name only. It is Hasbro's product. When AH went out of business, Hasbro bought the name and started using it as an umbrella for their strategy games like Vegas Showdown, Nexus Ops, Risk 2210, and so on."
boardgames,3dwrxr,SteveTassie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"Right. I don't want to negatively paint the name of Avalon Hill, since the criticism on this version of CE can surely be laid at Hasbro's feet."

I have Ascension on tablet and played the physical board game at a friends place and I quite enjoyed it. Planning to buy the physical copy at some point. I prefer the theme and play style of it over Legendary. It depends though I guess if you want a co-op game or not.  There's also Dominion - my partner has it though I haven't had a crack at it yet. He says it's a card builder similar to Ascension."

I'm sure I am forgetting one or two.  Of these, Dominion is hands down the one that gives us the most enjoyment. It is easy to bring to the table with newer palyers, or even players with no board game experience at all. And the tactical nuances is never ending, even after all my games. You will need an expansion or two after ten to twenty games or so, but that is true for all the games above."

It offers a cool way to build your deck (buy from the bottom row of a crumbling pyramid), and a neat, yet tricky, way to prune your deck (cards removed from hand make up your score at the end of the game). It's also cheap and has an expansion coming out within a month. Highly recommend."

The art on the cards is beautiful and there's an extension coming up !
boardgames,3dw31r,Droezie,2,Mon Jul 20 08:38:46 2015 UTC,"Came here to say Arctic Scavengers as well. It's not as ""HOLY EFF-ING CRAP! THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVAR!"" that some people make it out to be, but it is a really tight deck builder with an pvp element that I've not come across in a deckbuilder before.  As a side note, while I've not played Legendary: Marvel, I have played Legendary: Encounters and really enjoy that. It shares similar mechanics, but after watching the Tabletop episode of the Marvel version, there are some differences."

You are always forced in picking up some cards and when you have good strategy, it will work for numerous of games. I still play it only if insisted :) The game also tends to drag along to the end. If you are experimenting and your deck is not working as intended, you can sit down and watch the other guy combo for the next half an hour.  Legendary on the other hand more or less the same, but since you play cooperative, you have allot more room for experimenting and can openly discuss (fun with new players) what the best options are.  Star Realms (2-players) is also great, same as dominion but since the cards to buy are limited (only 5 open at the time and a new comes in play when you buy something) the game is much more different everytime you play it. When you see the other guy is kicking your ass, it will end 2-3 turns (max) later."

The player interaction mechanics are nearly perfect, and the game doesn't just end in the way Dominion and the others do. Because of the crashing system, and drawing more chips when one has a full stack, the ability to react and reverse the pressure exists all the way until the end.   I love it."
boardgames,3dw31r,JohnnyC1971,2,Mon Jul 20 13:08:31 2015 UTC,"Out of the two you listed I like Legendary more. It is called a cooperative games but it has competitive side. You are all against the same bad guys but you want to be better and score more points. I rarely add up the score at the end but have a very competitive friend that has to know. Helps when co-op games can leave you feeling like you are missing something. Mainly when you lose horribly, this seems to helps a bit.   It was mentioned once and does not get a lot of love but I love Core Worlds. Problem is you really need the first expansion to make the game feel whole IMHO. I have both expansion but I like the game. Tom at Dice Tower also likes the game if that is anything you care about.   I also believe TableTop did. Legendary play if you want to watch that. I saw it in my feed but have not watched any TableTop this season. Most of the deck builders have the same mechanic (build a deck and do something with it) so you really should find a theme you are into. I enjoyed Nightfall (vampires werewolves etc) but am a science fiction guy and Core Worlds is the theme I like. Hope that helps."

boardgames,3dw31r,ajpl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"Important Question: Do you want to solo it?  If so Eminent Domain is out and your original two still work I believe, specifically Legendary.  Important Question: Does it need to be Co-op or competitive?  Another competitive option is Core Worlds.  Lastly, I have heard a lot of good things about Legendary, but before you buy it, you should consider two things: 1) Legendary has repeat art; that is two different cards with the same art.  If that is something you are ok with, then never mind that... I personally abhor it. 2) It has setup involved.  Look into the specifics.  This isn't exactly a pick up and play.  It doesn't take an hour to setup, but it does require set up."

It has great replayability because you shuffle cards and draw tiles based on those, so you never know which rooms you will get. And since the tiles can be moved around on the offerings board, you may or may not be able to get the room you are after, so your castle will differ greatly each time you play.

boardgames,3dwla9,Altasia,2,Mon Jul 20 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"I'll address the last bit first cuz it's a simple fix. If the phones are an issue, bring it up. Either phones are being brought out because the game isn't interesting them, or they're just glued to their phones cuz that's how folks are today.   Bring it up like ""it seems like I'm going out of my way to bring these games and I know it shouldn't be a big deal but it bothers me to see people hop on their phones and check out from the game."" Offer to bring different games, offer to bring shorter games, and offer the suggestion of having no phones at the table rule.   As far as upping the complexity/difficulty of the games you guys encounter, it sounds like your group just isn't generally motivated by that kind of challenge. The big thing I loved about Pandemic was how we'd lose and lose and lose and then Hey! We won!!! And then we'd crank up the epidemics to the next level and do it again.   For some people (and sometimes it's a situational thing), that lose-lose-lose portion sinks in as discouraging. Some folks see a game with the chance that no one could win as a potential waste of time. They don't gauge the loss as progress towards a victory. It's just a loss. So they lean towards the cakewalks."
boardgames,3dwla9,EddieTimeTraveler,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"I can't help out on the first one as gamenights has naturally become a thing at my house so I usually host and provide the games. My friends do buy games and will bring them over if they want to play them but they seem less inclined considering I buy them fairly regularly.    I personally find that just assertive helps, don't ask ""Do you guys want to try this"" and explain the game, giving them the option to say no, instead say ""We're going to play this"" and explain the game. More often than not they'd rather begrudgingly agree to play then to leave or sit out the game. I find this gets certain people out fo their comfort zone and into the game even if after playing it they didn't enjoy it.    When I first started we had a rule that the T.V. was off and phones were put away. We've become much more relaxed on those rules but I believe it's more because a good game tends to suck people in and they like to stay engaged so that they know what's going on. The phone distraction often happens if we're trying to play a game that doesn't support the number of players we have, for example a 5 player game with 6 people. I do have a friend who tends to fiddle with his phone and try and play music or watch TV. It seems like he's more interested in hanging out then playing games which lead me to only invite him on days I knew we wouldn't be playing anything heavy.    Try asking people to just put their phones away, especially when playing a new game. It may sound like you're taking it ""too serious"" or being a ""hard ass"" but every group needs a host and setting these types of rules really does make the night more enjoyable because without them all you're doing is hanging out...which is fine, it's just not the reason for the gathering."

If you're looking for a co-op that's just plain unfair about half the time or where you just flip over a card and suddenly die, then...yeah, that's the game.    As to the difficulty of the games you're presenting your friends with, I'd simply not tell them how hard a particular game is.  Let them discover it on their own.  Robinson Crusoe is a beast, but I've had people enjoy it just for the stories it tells.    The best co-ops tell a story through the gameplay.  That's the appeal.  Your friends want a happy ending, but a game that has an interesting story can defeat that.  Start looking for those games that have the interesting, fun stories."
boardgames,3dwla9,Chessiecat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:06:48 2015 UTC,"to the first problem.   Just force it, next time setup a harder difficulty of the game. As for getting them into newer games. The way i've been doing it, is I bring a few games I know everyone likes, or are ""easier"" and shorter. But I always bring one longer one, thats a bit tougher.  Ie. ticket to ride, kings of tokyo, catan and Small world. With small world being the ""tougher"" one. I still like playing the other 3, but I enjoy the tougher/longer ones a lot more.  Lastly, go to a board game cafe and let them know ahead of time that you are there to try out tougher games that interest you. If they come along, they know what they are getting into. Went to Snakes and Lattes with a group of friends, tried some casual games as well as some tough ones and the tough ones still got lots of interest from them.   to the phone problem   Just bring it up. Don't be a bitch about it though. We had someone in our group who was a phone nazi. Brought out your phone? She would try to take it away, or go on a long rant about phones in modern society... no fun for anyone.

boardgames,3dwgmx,The_Rooster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:01 2015 UTC,Have to agree the current shitty exchange rate has slowed my collecting quite a bit. I've been backing some good kickstarters lately and that's been pretty good money wise. Been a good run of good projects lately. Been scratching the itch. But I'm going to have to pull the trigger on some new releases :( which is going to hurt.   Edit: just did a quick comparison of Camel Cup - 360 has it for £19.99. Here in Australian site found it for $49.95. Per today's exchange rate: $42.20 then the exchange charge plus shipping and the wait. Not that huge a difference. I also looked at Panamax - there was less of a difference. Almost on a par with about $70 bucks. Still if you want to save a few dollars might be worth it.

Bottom line though is that Aussies we are ripped off all the time. If they end up putting the GST up then more so!!  Might be cheaper online even with the shitty exchange rate. :)

I've played Caylus on iOS, imagine Agricola's bigger, meaner brother; Ora I've only watched reviews for, but it looks awesome: like Le Havre you can control which actions come out by building more buildings, and theres a spatial side where you want to put the right buildings next to each other."

Whether or not you agree, you definitely should try it as I think they're similar enough that you likely don't need both. Yedo is longer and some don't like the meanness if it, so results may vary.  Also Alchemists.  Like, yesterday.  Get on it.  Didn't really care for Trains and Stations. Can't really even tell you why as all the elements of it seem like they would add up to a great game.

boardgames,3du5v7,jackelfrink,62,Sun Jul 19 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"Race for the Galaxy.  20 minute game, 30 minute rules explanation.  To be fair, RFTG is a fantastic game when played with people who know what they're doing.  It's one I don't tend to bring with me to meetups though just because of the rules explanation and the number of games required for people to have any idea how to play."
boardgames,3du5v7,Otter_with_a_helmet,10,Sun Jul 19 14:37:21 2015 UTC,I came here to say this. My boyfriend and I saw this game on a dice tower video and wanted to try it. Vassal did say he only plays with people who know how since it takes a bit to explain the rules. Once we bought the game and figured out how to play we could see why no one wants to teach it to friends. Not to scare anyone away if they haven't played it. It's a very fun game it just has an abundance of symbols to learn. I recommend everyone to try it.
boardgames,3du5v7,Tralala01,5,Sun Jul 19 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's an odd duck. Once you know the rules, it's a snappy and compressed mid-weight game, but teaching it is harder than some heavier games.  It's a great game, but requires an investment of time and effort to unlock it."

boardgames,3du5v7,Tralala01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"The difficulty is that if one person in the group doesn't know how to play, you have to go through the whole song and dance.  The best way to learn is to watch and have someone explain what's going on while you read the rules, as it's a fairly enjoyable game to watch, but you need 5-6 players for that to work."
boardgames,3du5v7,wiithepiiple,4,Mon Jul 20 05:41:14 2015 UTC,Definitely Race. A good strategy I've found is I make the new guy watch Rahdo's run through before coming over. Then watch some of us play a quick game and ask questions as we play.  Lots of waiting but by far the best method I've used so far.
boardgames,3du5v7,srpods,5,Sun Jul 19 17:40:34 2015 UTC,First time players will definitely spend longer playtime than teaching though.  Experienced players burn through games like nobody's business though.
boardgames,3du5v7,Andarel,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I teach new players it's more like 30 minutes of rules, and 1.5 hours of playtime."
boardgames,3du5v7,kubalaa,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"So much this. I would never teach Race to anybody who I didn't know I was going to play it with multiple times.   It took my wife and I at least 10 games before we could play without asking about how a phase works or what a symbol means. Once you get past that, it's a great game, but I think it would be ruined for anyone who you tried to teach in one sitting."
boardgames,3du5v7,Shlant-,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yep. I tried to play it on http://keldon.net/rftg/ and it took me many, many games before I was consistently able to make legal moves, much less smart ones."
boardgames,3du5v7,saobentosaobento,46,Sun Jul 19 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"I have joked at times that this is how 7 Wonders is. It has a tech tree it in for the love of pete. And dont even get me started on science scoring. But play time itself is brisk. Even giving a generous 30 seconds per card and a minute for inbetween round calculations, that still clocks in at under 15 minutes. Why the box says 30 minutes I think is just the setup time."
boardgames,3du5v7,chirisu,13,Sun Jul 19 14:40:51 2015 UTC,Lol I stopped playing 7 wonders with my group because they can't manage it in under an hour with 6 players who have all played it before.
boardgames,3du5v7,zatchstar,11,Sun Jul 19 14:46:13 2015 UTC,Really? Our group of 7 can get it down to 30 minutes.
boardgames,3du5v7,chirisu,6,Sun Jul 19 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think we just have some exceptionally slow players sometimes. The group is a mix of casual party-gamers and more serious gamers, and 7 Wonders appeals to a mix of both groups.  Not so much analysis paralysis, just people not thinking ahead about what they're going to do. (The bane of my existence.) It makes games like Lord of Waterdeep last 4 hours (with expansions)."
boardgames,3du5v7,AtlasAirborne,5,Sun Jul 19 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"4 hours of waterdeep is like, my own personal hell.  One of the first things I point out to people is that you need to start planning your next turn at the end of your current turn, not at the start of your next.  Obviously, how much you can do this is inversely proportional to the amount of interaction in the game, but it's the difference between Formula D being a fantastic game and a complete snorefest."

But if you've got 4 hour games of Lords of Waterdeep, then it's the players you've got. Reminds me of the time I was stuck in a 4 hour game of Catan. Thankfully that player isn't apart of my regular group."

boardgames,3du5v7,chirisu,4,Sun Jul 19 18:01:05 2015 UTC,There are only 18 plays in the entire game. So everyone is taking 3 minutes per card?

boardgames,3du5v7,Norsbane,4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:38 2015 UTC,Wow! And I thought that 90 minute game of Love Letter I played once was bad.  You have more patience than I ever could.
boardgames,3du5v7,Maxpowr9,8,Sun Jul 19 18:41:47 2015 UTC,90 minute Love Letter??? I would definitely say that takes more patience than an hour of 7 Wonders. I am so sorry you had to experience that.
boardgames,3du5v7,mdillenbeck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:57 2015 UTC,Not nessasaraly. I should mention that we never finished. Instead when we were all tied 3 each we declared the game a draw. So each heart was 11 cards. 12 hearts. Thats is 132 playes in 90 minutes or around 40 seconds per play on average over the hour and a half. Thats five times better than the pace of the hour long 7 wonders mentioned above.
boardgames,3du5v7,TheReaver88,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:16 2015 UTC,Was that a whole game or just one round?

boardgames,3du5v7,ANGARRC,45,Sun Jul 19 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"Space Alert.  Definitely.  You basically have to play the game at least one time in a dumbed down version, possibly more, then play the actual game, but still more as a teaching tool.  I avoid playing the game with new players because of how long the game takes to teach, even though I really love the game."
boardgames,3du5v7,Bridger15,11,Sun Jul 19 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"I came here to say Escape: The Curse of the Temple. Same idea really; the game takes 10 real world minutes to play, but the explanation of how to play will take longer.  Though, I think this game is excellent for both new players and inexperienced board gamers. The rules are fairly simple once you know them, and everyone I've played with has had a blast."
boardgames,3du5v7,dbl_dbl,4,Sun Jul 19 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"No kidding. The manual actually describes eight different simulations to be played before attempting a real game, each with its own audio track. The game itself is rigidly timed, and, while the first and second test runs are only seven minutes long, simulations 1-3 and advanced simulations 1-3 are full length. If your group has a slow learning curve and has to run all 8, that's an hour and 14 minutes of just plotting your cards; the resolution takes at least as long as the planning phase. So generously assuming that the resolution is equal to planning, a worst case scenario group could take 2:28:00(-ish) to learn to play a 20 minute game."
boardgames,3du5v7,Norsbane,3,Mon Jul 20 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"Man, I really thought thir game was going to be worth it. I really regret buying it now. For my group and I, it just didn't pay off."
boardgames,3du5v7,rezaziel,4,Sun Jul 19 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"I actually have a lot of fun teaching the game.  But I Agree that by the time I had taught the game to enough groups of people to play it, we only got to playing the full game about half a dozen times before people wanted to play something new :\"
boardgames,3du5v7,logopolys_,3,Sun Jul 19 22:34:33 2015 UTC,I honestly think this should be at the top. I think this game collects a lot of dust on people's shelves because it is just so brutal to teach to people.

boardgames,3du5v7,jldugger,55,Mon Jul 20 00:51:59 2015 UTC,Four hours and six games later me and a buddy were still learning new rules for Android: Netrunner.
boardgames,3du5v7,paradigmx,13,Sun Jul 19 16:46:54 2015 UTC,Pretty much true of Magic and most other CCGs/LCGs/TCGs.
boardgames,3du5v7,jldugger,10,Sun Jul 19 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"Magic set the baseline for what things are called, Netrunner renamed them and ignored obvious questions that a player of card games would ask in the rule book. I dunno, I'm no scrub when it comes to learning game rules, and Netrunner was a nightmare."
boardgames,3du5v7,Amane_VIII,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of the trouble with A:NR comes from trying to stay away from Wizards intellectual property. The resolution stack and the concept of tapping both have been claimed by Wizards, and while there's an agreement, I suspect FFG is either avoiding those terms differentiate A:NR, or that Wizards wanted too much money.  There's also the source material to deal with. The best example from original Netrunner is probably Shell Traders. The wording is 10 percent shorter, but the real win is that list of errata on Shell Traders. FFG designers added the hosting mechanic as a way to codify that, and resolve some questions like what happens if Shell Traders is trashed (surprisingly, they stay 'in limbo'). Similarly, virus mechanics are part of the core game now rather than a sentence on every card. It frontloads the rules burden, but makes individual cards simpler to design, write, and learn."
boardgames,3du5v7,logopolys_,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"But Wizard's is stamped on every card, it's a Wizard's game as well as a Fantasy Flight game. I don't think it has any IP issues unless Wizard's themselves wanted the separation."
boardgames,3du5v7,dbl_dbl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"It could go either way really. For example, they could claim they owe a lower than typical royalty for netrunner because they:   Don't violate Patent 5,662,332 by using tapping or collectible cards (or antes). Brought their own IP from the Android universe. Hired the designer to work with them and fix up the rules and tweak cards; if need be they could substantially alter the ruleset to avoid infringing on Netrunner IP. Are reviving a dead franchise. If Netrunner was worth anything to Wizards, they haven't really demonstrated it."
boardgames,3du5v7,logopolys_,2,Mon Jul 20 06:33:47 2015 UTC,At least with Magic you have a comprehensive rulebook that covers everything.
boardgames,3du5v7,Amane_VIII,3,Sun Jul 19 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"It does, and as a reference book, the Magic comprehensive rules are amazing.  They are, however, pretty impossible to read straight through."

Now M:tG is a mess of creature abilities."
boardgames,3du5v7,CellularArrest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"Now M:tG is a mess of creature abilities.   There are a ton of creature abilities overall, yes, but not that many new ones per block.  This means that there isn't actually that much that needs to be learned for limited or standard.  If you play EDH, yeah, you'll be swamped by every left field mechanic."
boardgames,3du5v7,Amane_VIII,8,Mon Jul 20 17:56:05 2015 UTC,I think this one tops them all. Just learning the names of everything takes longer than playing a game.
boardgames,3du5v7,lianodel,6,Sun Jul 19 16:58:39 2015 UTC,The best part is when you have to go to one of the games designers twitter to get a ruling on card interactions.
boardgames,3du5v7,lianodel,7,Sun Jul 19 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, twitter is probably the right forum for rules clarifications when new cards are released on a more-or-less monthy basis, and there are pretty regular updates to the FAQ/Errata."

Since they have a terrible track record with rule books, I was incredibly pleased with that.  But yeah, it definitely takes longer than a game of Netrunner to wrangle most of the rules—and that's leaving out all the added knowledge that helps you play the game well. There was a big step between when my friends and I knew how to play, and when we actually knew what we were doing."
boardgames,3du5v7,paradigmx,2,Sun Jul 19 23:18:57 2015 UTC,I came here to say this.  I am fairly certain that my fiance still doesn't understand the rules without a bunch of hand holding.

Oh, you also need a second fold out display that tells you what each color on each spot of the figure's dial corresponds to which power, as different spots have different types of power and multiple powers use the same color.  Also, most figures nowadays have special powers as described on their character cards that work differently from normal powers.  Takes a long time to truly learn the game and even longer to feel confident about your skill in it. Top that off with a rarity system akin to MtG or Pokémon and that new sets come out like 4 times a year (with at least 50 different figures usually).  The game plays in 30-60 minutes, more if you use higher point levels. I played it for 8 months and still felt like a noob."

There's a fundamental difference between learning the rules for a game, and understanding how to make extremely smart, strategic decisions during the course of a game.    For example, yesterday I played my first game of Concordia with my girlfriend.  I taught her the rules, went through the cards, and we played the game in about 1.5 hours.  We really didn't know how our decisions would impact the scoring at the end of the game.  Sure, you can estimate or count keep a running total, but experience with the game would have helped us make better informed decisions.

This game is already funded and several stretch goals have been reached, with several more yet available, so there's still stuff to aim for. However, there are only 2 days left in case you feel you want to back up this project.  The game itself seems solid and looks GORGEOUS! It's being developed and improved for 2 years now, and like I said on last week's topic a few days ago, I'm amazed people don't talk about it, since so many in this sub seem to love Mage Knight. The reviews posted on the KS page seem to be very solid (I encourage you to see them for yourself) and they all highlight the depth of the game while being easy to teach and learn.  The team has experience publishing games for FFG KOSMOS IELLO amongst others for the past 5 years, plus, they have shifted stretch goals in favor of players due to several backers requesting one very appealing goal in particular, so this should tell you something about them (this also convinced me to pledge). Also, they communication with backers has been nothing short of awesome!  In any case, make sure to check the project and judge it for yourself here. Also check those pictures and reviews!  Give these guys some love because they sure seem to have placed a lot of work into this project.

boardgames,3du3u2,Cristek,8,Sun Jul 19 14:24:22 2015 UTC,"Judging from the comment section, the authors are incredibly nice ! They even gifted an add-on to their 1000th and 1001st backers (du to a technical problem of who was the 1000th backer haha !). They changed the order of their S.G. by popular demand. Who does this seriously ?!"
boardgames,3du3u2,BabyAzerty,7,Sun Jul 19 17:17:31 2015 UTC,This game is really the only thing that has really jumped out at me as of late.
boardgames,3du3u2,SarcasticGiraffe,6,Sun Jul 19 14:52:08 2015 UTC,This is really a beautiful looking game and the gameplay mechanics are very interesting. It's a must buy for me.
boardgames,3du3u2,thrainng,5,Sun Jul 19 14:54:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty stoked for this game.  Looks like a well thought out and tested game. All the reviews I've read also agree. The price is pretty much MSRP, but considering that I don't expect to see this game crazily available outside of the kickstarter, it's fine.  Plus you are supporting a group that is trying to get their game off the ground. They're not a big company, so I don't expect the big company pricing."
boardgames,3du3u2,JProph,3,Sun Jul 19 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"So I can pledge for the opportunity to get the game for full MSRP + shipping ($70 total)?  The Kickstarter exclusives aren't so good to really get me to pick it up now vs wait for retail where I can probably get it for $40 and free shipping. To me selling it for full retail means they are either trying to take advantage of their backers or they priced their game all wrong. Unfortunately I'm leaning towards the latter which also would worry me as a backer. This is the creator accounts first game. I don't know, it looks interesting but it has the potential to be one of those games that never delivers, delivers incredibly late, out has other big problems. The price doesn't mitigate the risks for me.  I've backed a good number of Kickstarter projects (over 50) and my worst experience so far is Two Rooms and a Boom (super late but will deliver). Part of that is knowing who to back."
boardgames,3du3u2,overthemountain,2,Sun Jul 19 16:43:55 2015 UTC,For me it came down to wanting to support the game and also the few (but good) exclusives for KS.  Especially the hero sheets.  Those look like a lot of fun.  Still you make a valid point and it's cool if this is not for everyone.      Full disclosure: I got an early bird so it's a better deal for me
boardgames,3du3u2,eflin202,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"This isn't about whether I like the game as much as it's about whether this company can deliver the game. Glory to Rome Black Box is a great game, but most people agree it was a nightmare of a Kickstarter."
boardgames,3du3u2,overthemountain,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Well you need to figure out if their project seems solid and cohesive. There's already several goals that will give extra content to the game that you won't get in retail, and they are close to yet another really nice one. But if they don't appeal to you, it's ok :)"
boardgames,3du3u2,Cristek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"That was part of my point, it doesn't seem that solid. Making a game with minis has been the downfall of many Kickstarters. That's a red flag for me right away if they haven't done it before. Not only have these guys not done it, but (as far as I can tell, could be wrong) they haven't produced a game before. They also haven't run a Kickstarter campaign before.   So that's 3 knocks - not insurmountable, that's what Kickstarter should be for to some extent, right? It's definitely getting risky, though. My original issue was that they don't know how to price the game. That's a 4th knock. They are either making a ton of money or they priced it too low and are going to struggle to afford to get it produced at the quality they want.   Kickstarter can be risky. This isn't about whether the game appeals to me or not. It looks like a decent game and I'm interested in it, but even if it was the best game in the world, it wouldn't matter if it never gets delivered. I assume it probably will. I just don't want to bet $70 that it will. The Kickstarter exclusive stretch goals aren't  worth the extra $30 and risk that I'll just lose everything to me. I hope it works out for everyone else, though."

Just for reference: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/22560/fantasmagoria   They are either making a ton of money or they priced it too low and are going to struggle to afford to get it produced at the quality they want.   So in your opinon they either overpriced it or underpriced it? You don't know which, you just know that it is currently priced wrong?"
boardgames,3du3u2,nmacholl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not sure what to make of that. They are listed, along with about 30 other companies as the publishers of Carcassone and various expansions. They are also listed along with about 10 other companies as the publishers of a game called Atlantis that came out about 5 years ago.  The designers are first time designers.   As a point of reference I wouldn't say this would do anything to mitigate the risk any further."
boardgames,3du3u2,overthemountain,3,Tue Jul 21 19:10:06 2015 UTC,I believe they did foreign language editions of the games you mentioned.  Just pointing out that they have published games before. Your original statement was incorrect. How you interpret that is up to you.
boardgames,3du3u2,nmacholl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on your definition of ""publish"". Sometimes these companies are simply the ones that import and distribute the games within their locale, rather than actually be responsible for any level of physical publishing."
boardgames,3du3u2,overthemountain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"The game looks solid. The only thing holding me back is my doubts about it maintaining it's magic as a 2 player game. The variant rules aren't bad (remove a faction, shrink the board) but so often games like this just don't hold up with a 2 player count.   Any thoughts?"
boardgames,3du3u2,eagreeyes,4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"Well the game is supposed to have a duration of 30 minutes per player, so the board will shrink, and with 2 players, the game will be half the time. The interaction will be different, that's a fact, but only play testes would know how that plays out. Still from a first look, I'd say that at the core the game would stay the same. Again, someone who has experience with these kinds of games would know better than me..."
boardgames,3du3u2,Cristek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Kind of a shallow week for new projects, but quite a few good ones closing out soon.   Paradox is looking to be a very solid light-medium strategy game. The artwork is beautiful, the bejeweled-style mechanic mashed up with the time travel theme is really cool as well. And the designer has been active on the boards here answering questions.  Swords and Bagpipes has one of the freshest mechanics I've seen in a while and has me really excited. Players secretly decide to back Scotland or England across seven battles (rounds). Backing Scotland pays out money, backing England (betraying) might pay more - but you also get a betrayal card. At game end, the player with the most money wins - unless England won more battles than Scotland (ie too many people betrayed to often) at which point the victory condition becomes ""player with the fewest betrayal cards"". I've been really on the lookout for games where the victory conditions swing wildly based on player actions and this delivers."
boardgames,3du3u2,eagreeyes,2,Sun Jul 19 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"Swords does look good, but I'm wondering how, thematically, it makes sense for someone with the least betrayal cards wins.  Ignoring the mechanics that would otherwise make it back England all the time, I feel like England would be more likely to execute or punish the ones who fought against them the most. Then the ones backing England would have the most to gain from England.  I think that thought makes me not want to play it, would bother me too much."
boardgames,3du3u2,andrewthemexican,3,Sun Jul 19 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"Look at the victory conditions from the position of the Scottish commoners.   You're playing as a Scottish lord, so if Scotland manages to win it's independence then the subjects are happy with you - even if you managed to get rich on the side.  If Scotland loses, however, your subjects are going to be really pissed and take it out on all the Lords. Thus, the Lord who did the least betraying might maintain the goodwill of the people (or maybe he is the only one with time to escape? :D)   It's definitely more of a party game and push your luck game than a wargame for sure."
boardgames,3du3u2,eagreeyes,4,Sun Jul 19 18:22:00 2015 UTC,I've been really on the lookout for games where the victory conditions swing wildly based on player actions and this delivers.    Take a look at Dragon Rampage. The end game condition changes based on player actions.

boardgames,3du3u2,ClankersGonnaClank,2,Tue Jul 21 07:59:06 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that Paradox hasn't taken off yet. The art direction is gorgeous and the Bejeweled-style mechanic looks like a lot of fun. I'm really looking forward to that one (assuming we can make that last 5%)

I'm personally a big fan of the space wargame Full Thrust - it's pretty much a ruleset into which you can plug in any sci-fi universe with any small-ish scale ship models.  No templates or tokens required - just dice, and printed ship sheets to track damage and orders.  I've got Babylon 5, Battlesta Galactica, and even Star Trek ships that I can play games with from a variety of sources.  I'm also heavily looking forward to the new Halo: Fleet Battles coming out tomorrow from Spartan Games.  Looks like it's going to be geared for wargaming newcomers with miniatures in colored plastic (to minimize need for painting for newbies) and easy-to-learn rules.  I think it will be pretty successful and have support for many years."
boardgames,3dvtaz,kengou,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"Full Thrust is a really, really great game. Customization of ships it's just fantastic and gives a lot of options.

boardgames,3dvtaz,kengou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"You don't need many minis, really. Depends on the army, but goes from 20 (elite/vehicle based) to 60 (lots of swarm-y things).  The ruleset it's very versatile. And it's 15mm, so it's dirt cheap (although you can go 28mm if you want)"
boardgames,3dvtaz,LeberechtReinhold,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"The cost factor can't be ignored, but another thing to keep in mind is that, with the exception of certain pre-assembled/painted games like X-Wing, a huge, sometimes predominant part of miniature gaming is the hobby of collecting and painting the figures.  I tagged along for a couple years with my brother when he was into the 40k scene and I would see the same people at the store spending hours just painting minis.  Some I never even saw them play a single game.  Just night after night after night of painting.  Another huge out-of-game time commitment for a lot of miniature games is theory-crafting and list building.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this stuff, but if you're somebody who's just looking for a new game it's good to know what you're getting into.  If you are interested in this side of the hobby then you will probably love it.  Strictly as a game though, I never found 40k particularly compelling.  Far too bloated and fiddly for my tastes, and I never felt all that excited by chucking 45 dice like other folks did.    That's about the extent of my knowledge on traditional miniature games.  I know a lot of former 40k players have migrated to Warmachine though so that's probably worth checking out.  At this point I'm more than happy with the $200 I've spent on X-Wing, which has gotten me a ton of variety and replayability for half the cost of my old, tiny Ork army."

After a huge break I've just started getting into Classic battletech, it's kinda retro but it seems like the rules cover a wide enough range to accommodate pretty much any kind of scenario (favoring giant robots obv) they also outsource miniature production (and currently I think they're involved in a marketing dispute) so you can get lots of generic metal minis for comparable cheap prices, also the battletech intro box I got comes with like, 26 pretty solid plastic mech models. Idk, I might be wrapped up in the novelty of it, but after buying and painting and filling out the record sheet for a bad ass Airship model I was hooked."

I played it early on and haven't touched it since and as an outsider, it seems the ""scope"" of the default game has gotten bigger, which is sad.

boardgames,3dvtaz,shitloadofbooks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"I quite like Warmachine/Hordes. Warhammer 40k seems to me like they are breaking out tomes of rules for minor rules checks all the time, where Warmachine feels much more streamlined, once you learn the terminology. Mostly you'll just need to know things like ""if it has cover, it gets +4 defense, concealment is +2"" and things like ""eyeless sight lets this model ignore concealment"" which is generally all right there on the model's stat card.  Infinity looks really sweet model wise, and I am very intrigued by it, but I can't see sinking money into two miniatures games, especially when there isn't a significant scene for one of them around here."

And it's popular enough that you'd be hard pressed to find a place where you couldn't grab a pickup game.  It's also run by a pretty unlikable company and has a price barrier to entry.  Battletech has about as much depth. With a little fanagling It can be played completely for free.   But it's a little harder to find a game.  there are some really great Skirmish level games. Malifaux or Infinity. But consider yourself lucky if you live in an area where you can find pickup games with any consistency.
boardgames,3dvtaz,AveDominusNox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:11 2015 UTC,"Mini war gaming is spoiled for choice when it comes to quality games these days.  The best game you're going to play is the one that is popular locally.  Getting to play different lists vs different people in a sub par game is much better than playing the best game ever, vs the same 1 or 2 guys with the same 3 or 4 lists every time you break it out.   That being said, mini war gaming is very popular where I live and all of the major games and lots of the lesser games have followings. The 3 games that I've invested in are Warmachine/Hordes, Malifaux and Dystopian Wars.  W/H is the most popular of the 3 locally and has the best support from stores. Tight rules and an active local competitive scene."
boardgames,3dvtaz,postal_bob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:37 2015 UTC,"For Napoleonic, I love ""Blücher"", by Sam Mustafa. It's grand tactical and the idea of corps movement system and reserve moves it's great and feels really different to other wargames. It also encourages mantaining the organization and focusing on certain parts of the battle.  For Reinassance there's FoG:R. They have released a great adaptation to PC, Pike&Shot, which you may want to check.  For WW2 we have recently played a campaign using Bolt Action and the campaign system of Rules of Engagement (a ficticious campaign in which the allies assault denmark in an attempt to take the north and rendezvous with the soviets), a great ruleset.  And finally for scifi, Full Thrust+Gruntz is a great conbo."

boardgames,3dwd8o,mrpielord,5,Mon Jul 20 02:12:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want honestly. If you want more variety in races, I'd look at getting one of the racial expansions, with Be Not Afraid probably being the best for a first expansion. If you like the game and just wish there was something to adjust for, I'd look at the Tales and Legends expansion as it adds something different each round that alters the rules slightly.    The other racial expansions, Grand Dames and Cursed! are ok, but I don't know if they're really essential additions to the game. If you want some map variety, Realms would be perfect so that you can adjust or make your own maps.    Lastly, I will say that if you just absolutely need more everything, then look at Small World: Underground. Very close to the same game with a couple of small tweaks, but it does add more races and powers that can even be brought into the vanilla game (for the most part) with some small adjustments.    None of the expansions are necessary to play other expansions, and there is no necessary order. I'd look at what you want to add to the game and go from there."
boardgames,3dwd8o,CoconutPete44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:53 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Realms is less useful without Underground though. A lot of the scenarios in the booklet are based on having Underground or both Underground and original. And the underground side of the tiles is pointless without it.

boardgames,3dwd8o,Gerolux,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"The 6-Player Board I would consider essential, and Leaders adds a fun new mechanic without interfering with the main game (I include it with newcomers). As you start building racial expansions, get Be Not Afraid or A Spider's Web first, to get the extra tray. You'll need both to contain all racial expansions however. Necromancer Island is probably the least important, as it changes the core competitive mechanic. If you're going for completion definitely get it (it's still no Carcassonne Catapult) but you'll probably spend a good few games before you can work it in. Tales & Legends I have no opinion on yet, I love the concept but haven't worked it into a game yet. Realms is interesting but with the 6-Player Board is much less essential."

boardgames,3dwedd,dankfloyd,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:08 2015 UTC,Mayday Games makes a pack of 100 euro size sleeves for about $2.  You can order them from their website or most flgs should be able to get them for you.
boardgames,3dwedd,membup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"They also have a really good customer rewards program. You get a good amount of points just for signing up, and I've pretty much only had to pay shipping on my last few orders because of all the points I racked up."
boardgames,3dwedd,ShinakoX2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:00:13 2015 UTC,This site was posted here a month ago or so. I've found it very useful. You just search for the game you want sleeves for and it'll give you several options.    http://boardgames.ga/
boardgames,3dwedd,otnavuskire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:40:08 2015 UTC,Swan Panasia sleeves come in all kinds of sizes. And they are generally cheaper than Mayday too.
boardgames,3dwedd,phrysen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:54:17 2015 UTC,I dont know where you find it cheaper than Mayday on swan.. For Mayday they have 100 euro sleeves for $2.25. Nothing is cheaper than $3.95 seemingly on swan.
boardgames,3dvjxh,familygames4fun,7,Sun Jul 19 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Battle of the Five Armies is a tactical war game, War of the Ring is an epic strategy game.  In War of the Ring the Free People wants to get to Mordor and destroy the One Ring or capture 4 points of enemy locations (which won't happen unless the Sauron player messes up), the Sauron player wants to capture 10 points worth of enemy locations or corrupt the ringbearer (which uses tile draws from a bag and I never have had happen).  While BotFA is about combat on the open plays and the details of troop movements, WotR will have mainly long multi-turn sieges that favor the Free Peoples.  There is also a political element - not all forces are active, and none are in war mode.  The hero must either wait for Sauron to go to war an offend a nation or split people off from the fellowship to convince nations to become active and then eventually go to war.  Oh, and the Free Peoples armies die and are out of the game while the Sauron forces just go back to the pool to make an endless supply.  One disappointment is the lack of difference in units - elites are just 2 hp units that can take 1 hp damage to continue a siege, and all the troops are the same in attack with some event cards triggered by a type of unit being present.  Overall, they are two very different feeling games despite sharing the action dice mechanic and card enhanced play.  I prefer the play of WotR to BotFA, but there is room for both in a game collection.  If you are a Middle Earth fan, I'd suggest having both even if it does eat up shelf space."

(I know it's available on Amazon, but for almost full MSRP and I assume it will be discounted when actually available). Thanks again!"
boardgames,3dvjxh,mugsnj,2,Sun Jul 19 23:46:23 2015 UTC,Their website says August.   And I second the recommendation of owning both. I was amazed at how they made the games so similar and so different at the same time.

boardgames,3dvjxh,RandallFlagg19,3,Sun Jul 19 23:45:29 2015 UTC,"I got a base copy of the game and have spent close to $500 customizing it. I kinda like the game, kinda a Tolkien nerd"
boardgames,3dvjxh,mdillenbeck,3,Mon Jul 20 00:11:55 2015 UTC,"A pimped out copy?  If I say ""My life for you"" can I come over and play a game, I assume you'll be the Sauron player...  War of the Ring is my second favorite game - my favorite is the 1980s ICE game Fellowship of the Ring since it is a ""what if"" game that focuses on the characters only (not the battles) and uses fog of war and rumor generation (example: 4 cubes representing the Free People and 5 hobbits - the four we know and one extra - start in the shire... two, three, or four may actually be hobbits; when they move next turn, they can generate even more rumors).  Its fiddly as can be, it isn't the most beautiful game (except the map is very well done), and it is a bit dated (meaning the rules are long, somewhat complicated, and crunchy - just the way I like them)."

boardgames,3duai5,backdoorhack,3,Sun Jul 19 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"I noticed you have chinese versions of Carcasonne & Camel Cup. Where are you (in the world), and is it difficult to find boardgames there? Is there a large boardgame culture in your city?"
boardgames,3duai5,moo422,8,Sun Jul 19 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"We're in the Philippines! It is part of South East Asia. The reason for the Chinese versions are that some games are distributed by Swan Panasia. Thankfully these games don't have too much text on the board and pieces.    Board gaming has recently blown up in our country. First due to the appearance of /u/wil 's Tabletop.  Our country apparently has a high percentage of internet users, so having an online show to pique interest might have helped.  Also, one online store owner/gamer diligently developed a board game culture by organizing monthly free board game days in a famous mall.  That slowly built the board gaming culture here in metropolis. Now we have several board game cafes opening across the city. We couldn't be more delighted*.  * Well, getting a Takenoko or Small World collector's edition would probably do the trick"
boardgames,3duai5,moo422,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic to hear!! Great to see you have some games with euro-complexity as well. I always worry that new boardgame markets will only have access to lighter games, glad to see the Philippines have moved well past the lighter games phase."
boardgames,3duai5,Reapersfault,3,Sun Jul 19 16:05:58 2015 UTC,2 copies of both the base and the expansion to Lords of Waterdeep.. Was that intentional :p?
boardgames,3duai5,jumbodrop,2,Sun Jul 19 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes. That's totally intentional, this is a shared collection between 5 guys. We just brought over all the games so we could take this pic."
boardgames,3duai5,snuffles00,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:04 2015 UTC,Please tell me what you think of Scoville. It is next on my purchase list and I would love to hear your opinion. Also fantastic collection.
boardgames,3duai5,HeirToPendragon,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I like Scoville! It features a unique (for me at least) farming mechanic where you get a color of the chili that is the combination of the chilis you pass through. Memorizing the combinations can be pretty daunting during the first game (especially for me, being partially color blind). But after a couple of games, you might not even need the chart anymore.    The only thing that kind of bothers me is the advantage of being the first person to harvest a white or black chili (technically lvl 3 chilis). It can be kind of brutal if one opponent misplants a chili and allows another to get a black, white or ghost chili easily. But through time, people would probably learn not to do that.  Edit: I would also like it more if the in game pictures were little more color blind friendly. Higher level chilis are actually taller than lower level ones, but it is sometimes hard to notice the difference in images."
boardgames,3duai5,dbl_dbl,2,Sun Jul 19 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Scoville is a really tight and frustrating Euro. Most of the game is about the auction for turn order, because your place in turn order is incredibly important.  I know a lot of the time I play the game there is much yelling and screaming at each other because of moves that blocked or stole your plans. It is super fun for something so strictly Euro."
boardgames,3duai5,jumbodrop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:20:31 2015 UTC,How do you like Imperial Assault. I have heard wildly different opinions on it.

I'm the resident Star Wars geek in /u/backdoorhack's game group, so in my (biased) opinion, it's an awesome game, especially if you're a big fan of the movies. It's a bit hard to get to the table with these guys though, as there's a new game to try almost every board game night."

Also, I'm a sucker for anything with custom dice so Seasons and Roll for the Galaxy (even though I haven't played yet, lol) are in the top #10 too.    Bummer you can't come to Gencon. Hopefully, you can make it next year!"
boardgames,3duk8s,604COOK,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"I hear you like custom dice, so I'm curious as to why you don't have any Quarriors or Dice Masters in your collection yet.  Have you heard of them?  Have you played them?  If so, why did you choose not to get them?"
boardgames,3duk8s,mdillenbeck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:10 2015 UTC,I have heard bad things about both of those games so I probably won't buy either until I get a chance to play them for myself. I'm not really into the collectible aspect of Dice Masters either.
boardgames,3duk8s,G_ulti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about Seasons? I've been looking at picking it up as it looks pretty cool, but I'm unsure with a ~50$ price tag."
boardgames,3duk8s,G_ulti,5,Sun Jul 19 19:24:00 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I really enjoy Seasons.  My wife prefers cooperative games, and this was one of the early competitive games she liked.  Seasons has some of the best dice I've seen in a board game - big dice with wonderful feel and a satisfying thump on the table.  They roll, but not too far - and the simple iconography on each face is quick and easy to learn.  The game is a combination setup card draft (which may appeal to some modern Magic: The Gathering players, but is limited to only 9 cards that get split into 3 stacks of 3 by a player and is thus okay for those not into card drafting) and dice drafting (every round, and the unselected die is what controls the speed at which the 36 ""months"" in the game go by).  For beginners, they list 4 starting decks of 9 cards so you don't have to worry about drafting - just jump into the game.  During the game you are trying to summon different artifacts and allies to gain end-game victory point, most points win.  The cards are divided into two decks: a 30 basic card set and 20 advanced card set (each set has 2 copies of each card).  Most cards are not aggressive, but there are a few attacking cards.  Also, you can't just summon cards right away - you have to also increase your summoning limit (number of cards you can bring into play).  There is a luck mitigation option allowing you to do an action at a point penalty three times in a game.  The artwork is nice, it plays well with 2, provides lots of meaningful choices, uses randomness to keep up replay value, and the component quality is good.  The only dislike I have is the cubes used to track things are a little big and easily knocked around.  Small disks with less height would have been better.  For me Escape: The Curse of the Temple was a hard pill to swallow for its price, but I enjoy it.  I get that all those dice and cardboard tiles are expensive to make, so I paid the price and bought the game (get the big box if you ever add this to your collection) - but with Seasons there was no regret about its cost.  Those dice are my favorite in any game, both in physical quality and how they work mechanically in the game.  If you like Magic: The Gathering, if you like drafting games, and if you like games with some minimal direct confrontation then Seasons is a no brainer - and well worth the cost.  However, this is one game where I haven't felt the need to buy the expansion (if I'm wrong about the expansion, someone feel free to extoll its virtues and sell me on it)."
boardgames,3duk8s,mdillenbeck,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"You can try the expansions virtually on BGA if you are interested.  I've only played three times with them (all in), but they seem to be pretty interesting and added lots of cards to the deck. I'm not sure if its just a drafting rule I clicked or due to expansions, but it changed the drafting to a pick one and pass the rest on when getting your starting 9 cards?  We ended up playing with the expansions to try something different.  It seemed to get to a point for us where we constantly saw some cards generally give a greater edge than some (in the base game, eg hand of fortune in the draft seemed to let someone lead early and keep it)"
boardgames,3duk8s,TonyStellato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:57:28 2015 UTC,Great overview of the game! And my sentiments exactly!
boardgames,3duyur,plolock,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Arena is the new name for the base game.  It is the same game as mage wars except they put more cards in and a new map board.  Mage wars Academy is a shorter playtime, no map version of the base game.  All the cards in Academy are useable in the base game(Arena). For Arena, they are putting out a customizable map pack called Domination. It adds new game objectives and cards to mage wars.  Again the cards can be used in regular Mage wars."
boardgames,3duyur,Gooberboober32,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:53 2015 UTC,I have and older copy of Mage Wars with the expansions. Are there any new cards in Arena that I don't already own?
boardgames,3duyur,nappy-doo,3,Sun Jul 19 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. it's the same, except for the erratas."
boardgames,3duyur,BlueSapphyre,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"and a few alt-arts, I believe"
boardgames,3duyur,MusicIsPower,2,Sun Jul 19 22:28:14 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think they just give more copies of utility cards like dissolve and dispel.
boardgames,3duyur,Gooberboober32,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:06:23 2015 UTC,So do I buy everything again?
boardgames,3duyur,Reginald__Cousins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't need to, your original base set will still play just fine."
boardgames,3duyur,Gooberboober32,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:08:35 2015 UTC,no  Its just a name change.  nothing changes about the cards.  They added Arena to the base product so you can tell different Mage Wars apart from Mage Wars Academy and future products.
boardgames,3duyur,Gooberboober32,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:43:50 2015 UTC,So what is mage wars Academy?
boardgames,3duyur,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:57 2015 UTC,"From what I gather, Academy is a shorter version of mage wars.  Removes the board and alters the rules.  Its not officially out until Gen Con so I am not sure what else it involves."
boardgames,3duyur,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"It removes the spatial aspect of the game. So it plays more like Magic the Gathering, except you still have your spellbook to choose from. Academy cards will be compatible with Arena, but not vice versa."
boardgames,3duyur,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:54 2015 UTC,So in other words I have to buy arena as well?
boardgames,3dvv9x,RoboShindo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"I've found coup (and expansion later) easy to teach to non-gamer friends and family. It is still a little luck based with the draw, but everyone has fun."
boardgames,3dvv9x,kuzai123,2,Mon Jul 20 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"Obvious one: Ticket to Ride.  Since they don't like Pandemic, then Foragers is out - but maybe Forbidden Island would be a better game for the family.  Nile DeLuxor is a simple game of set making with a couple neat twists.  A half step up from that and one that I find works really well is San Juan (and could maybe someday lead into teach them Puerto Rico, and then the next thing you know you'll be playing Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition with them... okay, I kid).  Another alternative to Pandemic would be Pandemic: The Cure, a dice version of the game (which means luck based).  Heck, even Flash Point: Fire Rescue played at the family game level would be a good choice.  Tokaido and Takenoko are also good choices with very interesting artwork.  Maybe Dixit - or if they are clue fans try Mysterium (okay, I don't think the game has been released in North America yet but it will be soon).  There are tons more, but these are the ones that pop into my mind first."

You don't want to be sitting at the table with everyone playing their own game. While Ticket to ride, takenoko, ... are all good games, I don't consider them ""family games"".  I would go for something like: - Dixit  (like mentioned before) - Sherrif of nothingham - Forbidden desert (the better one) - Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game (if they like marvel) - Survive: Escape from atlantis - The resistance: Avalon (the better one - 5players+ recommended) - Galaxy trucker - Coup (like mentioned before)"
