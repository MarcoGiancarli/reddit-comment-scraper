First of all, I should let you know about the scarce source of LSD  around the United States. This stuff isn't as abundant as it used to be in the 70s/80s, and the precursor to make LSD is highly monitored and kind of hard to find..while it's the only way to synthesize it, it makes the process a lot easier.  I can guarantee you that most of the ""acid"" you'll be finding through fraternities, co-ops, etc, are probably DOx (psychedelic amphetamines, like Peoples_Park said) or the 25n-series (25i-NBOMe, etc). The problem with using RCs and claiming it as LSD is the dosage, people will take a lot and end up going fucking crazy and/or cause some serious psychological problems.   I recommend you consider buying from the Dark Net Markets where the risk factor of not getting what you actually want is a lot lower. As for getting into there, try google.   Honestly, I think it would be much easier for you to microdose on shrooms."

Find a person you trust who has a lot of experience and has, so to speak, gotten high on their own supply.  I'd start my search with the co-ops and work through there.  If something is tainted or fake, a good dealer will be smart about it -- just don't go and try to score LSD off People's Park residents or anything and you'll be OK.  Shrooms are a lot more intense, if you haven't done them before I wouldn't suggest microing on them first/instead of LSD.  Good luck!"

berkeley,3e3053,kerokerokeropi,2,Tue Jul 21 21:59:08 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful, this could be dangerous. I am going to assume you have no experience with [hard] drugs. Taking drugs is awesome, straight up. But as the cliché goes: with great power come great responsibility. Hence, it is very important that you are a responsible drug user, casual or otherwise. Given the right circumstances, taking LSD will be the greatest experience in your life. It is hard to describe but the drug itself should not be the experience, it just takes you along on a trip. In general, drugs should not be consumed to create a situation but it should add to the situation. If you aren't coming from a good place or a healthy mind, acid can lead you down dark roads or dark places. The potential rewards do not measure up to the risk if this is a real possibility for you. If you have HONESTLY made some real changes and maybe need some reinforcement or encouragement to CONTINUE PURSUING these changes then maybe it could be considered as a possibility. However, if you are in a bad situation and are hoping for this to give you an enlightening experience that will be a beacon in the darkness giving you direction, then this is not for you. You need to make some improvements to your life before seeking Nirvana. This beacon you seek is your purpose in life and can be a lifetime journey spent trying to find in vain, not something you casually picked up on a Tuesday afternoon. I'd be happy to hear more about your situation via PM or whatever and I can offer guidance if this is for you. I know I really can't make you not take it if you really want to. I am also more than happy to talk about good strategies for the trip itself since this is probably your first time. I will leave you with my thoughts after dropping the first time: Taking it for the first time is like your mind losing its virginity."
berkeley,3e3053,Peoples_Park,2,Wed Jul 22 00:16:05 2015 UTC,"I've taken shrooms before several times and have had a horrifically bad trip during one of those experiences, so this warning really warms my heart to hear from a complete stranger: thank you for your concern and for your kind words.  I think I can handle this though, particularly if I micro dose. I am thinking I would not consume more than a tiny tiny corner of a ""tab"". I don't want to get high or even have a trip, I just want to try verifying some things that I've read about microdosing: that it is a huge asset with physical skills, and mental skills such as learning new languages."

There are ""psychedelic amphetamines"" out there, that are really nasty.  You don't want brolamfetamine instead of LSD.  People associate the Berkeley drug scene with peace, love, and hippie-spirituality but the harsh reality is there are scammers peddling tainted goods or outright fake goods.  Sadly, some people don't even know they are selling fake stuff.  If a seller has never actually had real LSD, then they have no idea if their supplier has given them bogus goods.  There is fake acid in Berkeley that is sold as LSD.  (There is also tainted or fake MDMA in Berkeley.)  There are sellers with good stuff around, but the only way to be absolutely sure is to test.  Since it is summer, there will be better chances of finding LSD around.  But once summer is over, it will be harder to find, which means you might want to buy in bulk.  The internet is another option.  The Darkweb has drugs at discount prices."

berkeley,3e3053,hohohomyy,7,Tue Jul 21 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"LSD is serious business.  I've seen people get messed up through their enthusiasm for it.    LSD production is done in huge bulk.  So when a producer gets raided, large percentages of the nation's supply can be destroyed by the DEA in one operation.    It is exactly like the prohibition on alcohol.  People were essentially selling and drinking poison, because that's all people could get.  The government would destroy real alcohol producers, and people ended up drinking paint thinner and other random junk.  LSD needs to be legalized and regulated.  Keeping it illegal isn't stopping it from being part of our culture. People want to experience a trip.  The trip is part of our music, our movies, our literature.  The DEA isn't stopping people from wanting LSD.  People are dosing on fake stuff, or tainted stuff which have very harmful neurological effects.  There are many online guides about internet privacy and buying drugs online through encrypted websites.  Buying online is something I've never tried, so I cannot make any recommendations on the process.  Buying from people on the street can happen, it is just not as easy as buying weed; it is not a commodity many people have.  It is probably easier to buy in San Francisco than in Berkeley, but that's not certain.  Look around at concerts and music festivals."

Lecture slides are posted online, and the tests are based from the lecture slides, so it's easy to catch up if you skip a couple lectures.

University introduces complex, abstract realities that break the simple methodologies of grade school, requiring new, higher level abstract thought processes.

It dismisses the possibility of constructive criticism, i.e., suggesting change or growth to one who's ""being yourself"" is ""disrespectful.""   you know, a possibility here is that people are justified in their behavior. so when you ""suggest change"", you expect conformity from people but don't want to, or aren't prepared to, acknowledge their circumstances or past. lol nvm, let's not put thought into this. it doesn't fit in with the rest of your narrative."
berkeley,3dsil5,blahblah98,2,Mon Jul 20 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"captitalism=selfishness=bad, change=good amirite guys      Dude, I founded a corporation and worked at startups & public companies for years.  Corporations are selfish & sociopathic, and are no model for individual behavior.  Change for no reason isn't good, but students come to University because they seek to change for good reason: to advance themselves, develop / mature & become competent in their disciplines.  Some come because they have no idea, but hopefully they do by the time they graduate.  And yes for the bottom of the class, university can be a waste of time & money.     a possibility is that people are justified in their behavior        Of course an individual's behavior is certainly based on their unique personal  experiences.  Malala Yousafzai's an example of an extraordinary person with unique experiences, but even Malala * learned* from the great leaders she met, is a great proponent of education, and a catalyst for change in her society.  So we all have our own experiences, but at the same time we're not all at the Malala level.  We benefit by learning alternative behaviors, how others in simliar situations behaved, being challenged to think and explain our behaviors and consider alternatives.  A willingness to self-examine, understand other perspectives, and change one's self for the better is core to the  university experience.  If you're not open to change, if you just want to ""be yourself,"" why bother with the time, effort, and cost of attending University?     So... I asked your major to understand why you're bothering to attend Berkeley  if you feel no need to change yourself.  Based on comments so far, it sounds    like you have money & time to burn & nothing better to do.  Life's great if you have a trust fund or live on someone else's dollar.  Most of us have to pull our own weight."

berkeley,3dsil5,blahblah98,2,Mon Jul 20 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"another awesome assumption     You've assumed plenty about me & my position, while explaining nothing about your position.  In the vacuum, what is there to conclude?  Fill in the blanks, dude.  Since you haven't, evidently you can't.  Maybe you're just being yourself.  End of discussion then?"

You can find this sort of thing all over the town, and the folks that tend to get upset are usually uptight students who think they're better than the residents who've been here for decades.  So yeah, this is the most Berkeley thing that's been posted in the subreddit in a while."

berkeley,3drt1j,muerteman,7,Sun Jul 19 07:36:39 2015 UTC,"Exams are usually all graded on the same day, in an attempt to increase the fairness of grading. I TA chemistry at another school and generally the professor will lock all the TA's in a room and buy us pizza, and we don't leave until we've graded 200+ exams. It generally takes 4+ hours,but after around 20 exams you have seen 95% of the ways students are going to answer a given question, so grading consistently gets easier. All a 24 hour turn around means is that the TA's were all able to get together and grade on the same day as the exam."

berkeley,3drjjy,p_by_induction,17,Sat Jul 18 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"I personally try to get out of the room ASAP, and not get caught up in the talking to people about answers/the curve. Go get some good food with people who either aren't in the class or people who are in the class but you have a mutual agreement with them to not talk about the test. Seriously, there's nothing a good Chipotle burrito can't fix."
berkeley,3drjjy,igotmoveslikejagger,13,Sat Jul 18 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"Great tip, I HATE talking about tests after I take them, there's no point in getting worked up about it anymore since it is over now. I just leave, go eat, and forget about it."
berkeley,3drjjy,brandonDFA,4,Sat Jul 18 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The most we can do is study as much as possible - after that, just take pride in the effort you put in, and everything else will sort itself out. In fact, I don't think I've ever talked to my friends about our grades at all. At most, this is a typical conversation before moving onto the next topic:   How'd it go?   I felt good about it/I didn't do super hot/etc.  That's awesome man!/Don't worry, you definitely have time to improve your grade with the next one/etc.   The last thing I want is to let grades become dividing lines (either consciously or subconsciously) between myself and my friends."
