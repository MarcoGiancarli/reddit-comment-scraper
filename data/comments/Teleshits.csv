Teleshits,3cva7d,hiptobecubic,6,Sun Jul 12 06:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they also made a Dark/Dragon type called Hydreigon and its GEN V's pseudo legendary and that's awesome.  For those not aware, pseudo legendary pokemon are just pokemon from a generation that have insanely high base stats and stat gain but are not legendary. Examples include Metagross and Dragonite.  Trash bag is pretty retarded though, I will give you that. Let's not forget that Koffing is literally just lung cancer personified so the old gens had their share of trash as well."
Teleshits,3cva7d,Majestic_Toilet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"Koffing was the gaseous analogue to Muk's industrial slime. They were evil pokémon used by evil trainers and taught lessons about pollution. Garbonzo is just a bag of garbage.  Other recent gems include an ice cream cone, a keyring (with keys!), a lamp, this thing with balls on his chin, a sword that turns into two swords and a disgusting snot-bear.  Sure pokémon were always silly, but these aren't even interesting. It's like they were sitting around the office and just picked whatever shit they had laying around."
Teleshits,3cva7d,hiptobecubic,3,Sun Jul 12 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, the snot bear looks dumb, the keyring looks very dumb, the Castform (balls on its chin one) is at least somewhat interesting, its body changes color and shape with the weather in battle, and the ice cream cone one is dumb.  The swords one and lamp actually look kinda alright though. The one that the lamp evolves into is basically a ghostly chandelier though and it looks really dumb.  Apart from that, it feels like the quality has gone down, but not by a shitload. After all, we could also include the more positive examples like the literal psychic tank Metagross, Braviary (fuck yeah america), or dragon hammerhead shark underground thing Garchomp.  I mean shit, Pokemon is like anything else in this world. A lot of shit, a few awesome things."

But it's Grandpa Lou's turn to babysit the tots, but he would rather rekindle a prior romance.

Teleshits,2pqhth,wbright92,8,Fri Dec 19 16:53:19 2014 UTC,"lol Thats's actually a frightening coincidence. I used to go to Spencers Gifts a lot when I was younger, and I remembered seeing that exact illustration on one of the cards they sold there. So, when I saw that picture of Tommy and Chucky, I thought it was a perfect fit for that joke.  I must have been 14 when I saw that, so it's a pretty old picture. The fact that very same picture, which I hadn't seen in almost 15 years, is posted on iFunny the very same night I just happened to remember it, is beyond fucking freaky.  Literally, my mind is blown."
