endcard,3dblx9,Eddz0,3,Wed Jul 15 00:29:41 2015 UTC,"It says:   Harpy  A bird-like non-human species. Like birds, they lay eggs and have poor night vision. They dislike scarecrows planted in fields and CDs hung from balconies. Harpies can be omnivores or carnivores. They have evolved to fly,  and even adults have small, child-like frames. Like Lamias, their species consists only of females, and they require human males to reproduce.  Harpy Subspecies  Poultry  A harpy subspecies adapted for laying eggs. They cannot fly and are unable to run at high speeds like land animal harpies. However, they produce far more eggs than other subspecies, and they continuously lay eggs nearly every day. Poultry harpies have a red crest on top of their heads. Unlike chickens, their appearance is natural, not selectively bred. They are very cowardly (chicken).  Land animal  A subspecies of harpy adapted for terrestrial life, like ostriches and emus. Their wings are small, but their bodies have evolved to be larger than humans. Using their thick, powerful legs, they can run at incredibly high speeds. Despite their large bodies and sharp claws, they are generally easygoing.  Raptor  A large eagle- or hawk-like harpy subspecies. Their bodies are very similar to human bodies. Though other subspecies are omnivorous, raptor harpies are carnivores. They are proud and difficult to please, an unusual trait among the generally amicable harpies."
