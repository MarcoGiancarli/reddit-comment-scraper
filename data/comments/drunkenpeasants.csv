No one is calling him racist because he mentioned statistics, we're calling him racist because he used those statistics as an excuse for black people being treated unfairly.   He literally said ""Oh people who are black are often treated unfairly by the cops? Maybe they should stop committing crimes"". How is that not racist? That sentence heavily implies that an individual should be held responsible for the actions of a bunch of other people who share the same skin color.  And he only brings up murder statistics, which completely ignores that fact that so many of these cases of police brutality are against people who commit small crimes or even no crime at all. Freddie Gray was murdered in the back of a police van for allegedly possessing an illegal knife, but I guess he had it coming because he was black so he would have killed someone with that knife. Tamir Rice was shot because he had a toy gun, but come on, it's totally not racist for the police to assume that it's a real gun that he was going to kill someone with because black people commit so many crimes.  I'm so tired of these people hiding behind ""statistics"". Statistics aren't racist, they was you use them is."

This wasn't all that uncommon, in fact most black americans today have a good chunk of European heritage.  20-30% of the average African-American's genome comes from Europe, and 35% of black men can trace their Y-DNA back to Europe (usually Britain).

drunkenpeasants,3cvuv8,Gunfire69,5,Sat Jul 11 05:12:12 2015 UTC,"He had a spat with Fakesagan (now TheSmoothTerrorist and once TJ's friend) around 2008-2009, which led to him releasing revenge porn of FakeSagans girlfriend on Encyclopedia Dramatica (as far as I know, the video is still available there), who happened to have dumped Capnoawesome for Fakesagan which left Capnoawesome bitter.  After he released the revenge porn video, the entire YouTube community turned on him (rightfully so, because what he did was petty, sickening and possibly illegal), in response he panicked and quit (he thought he was going to be arrested in fact).  He certainly didn't leave due to lack of interest.  No doubt he regrets doing it to this day as he probably would have had a subscriber count similar to TJ's if he stayed around and would probably be making enough money to not be a wandering vagrant.    Edit: in case you don't even know who Capnoawesome is, he was a big atheist YouTuber way back in its early days before Google bought it, starting around 2006 I believe.  He gained a considerable following (for the time) and was clearly trying to make it some sort of career, an entry into comedy (he was in fact an aspiring stand-up comedian).  In a nutshell, if Maddox were an early 20s atheist with a speech impediment, he would have been Capnoawesome.  His videos against Islam were particularly notorious, many of which I believe can still be found on YouTube.  He was also friends with TJ (I think TJ became big initially because he got shout-outs from Capnoawesome in fact).  He's since totally vanished from public memory since the only people who remember him are veterans like me who have been on the site since its inception 10 years ago :P"

drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,JanuaryDynamite,7,Sun Jul 5 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'd only seen a few of his videos before, which were bullshit complaints and whining about TYT, and this doesn't make him look any better.   His response Jaclyn was definitely racist. It's not the fact itself that is racist but how he used it. She simply mentioned that black people are treated unfairly by police, a point which has a lot of evidence to back it up. And then he goes and says ""well maybe they shouldn't commit so much crime"", as if that's some sort of excuse for police brutality.   The problem is that these are cases of individuals being treated unfairly by the police such as Eric Garner (who resisted for approximately 1 second before being choked to death unlike AiU would have you believe) and Tamir Rice (the kid with an airsoft gun who was shot without warning), cases that a part of much larger problem of racism among police. These individuals are not responsible for a lot of blacking committing crimes. That's what makes the statement racist; AiU is holding all black people responsible for the black people who commit crimes, that is pretty much the definition of racism.  And I just watched his response to the DP segment. Wow, what a whiny racist moron."
drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,Flamdar,4,Sun Jul 5 07:23:38 2015 UTC,"Not in the loop, never heard of this guy. Tried to watch a video and it was utter garbage. His ""channel update"" video about the atheist experience DMCA included a video of a bass cover from Anna Sentina without sound. Seems like an asshat to me."
drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,ColinOnReddit,3,Sun Jul 5 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"Him saying that ""Black people should stop committing so much crime"" is completely ignorant of many of the issues that those communities have faced through out history and even currently. It's pretty clearly racist."
drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,myjeren,-1,Sun Jul 5 09:03:14 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the content of both channels, and I think there's criticism to be leveled at both groups.   Devon (Atheist Roo) did misrepresent Jaclyn's position. Her point was clearly not that white suspects should be beaten and abused, but that black suspects shouldn't be beaten and abused.   In addition to this strawman - he also said ""Well no shit black people shouldn't be abused. This point is so obvious, it doesn't need to be said."" That's nonsense. The point does need to be made, because there is evidence to suggest that police are harsher to minorities, especially black people. I don't think racism should be written off as a non-issue in a large percentage of the police force. Black crime statistics don't justify the more extreme responses that police tend to give them.   However, I do think Jaclyn was ambiguous when she made reference to criticisms of the Charleston shooter being escorted away in a bullet proof vest. On the DPs, she said ""That wasn't a point I was making - that was something I saw other people saying online, and I was repeating it."" It was seemingly obvious that she agreed with this point - per her usage of it in her original video - so saying ""Nah guys, that's not me"" looks like a backpedal.   Also, DPs denouncement of ""Black people should stop committing so much crime"" as racist is worthy of scorn. Devon is paraphrasing known crime statistics, and even though he was using hyperbole when he said blacks are responsible for ""infinitely"" more crime, the point he was making was clear.   Devon had some points worth making, but sabotaged himself by misunderstanding / misrepresenting the video he was responding too. The DPs' criticism of that video was justified, but their dismissal of some of Devon's points is unsettling.   I'm not unsubbing from either channel, as they both make content I like, but I can say they both dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Though, I will say that Devon dropped the ball much harder."
drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,Vivendo,2,Sun Jul 5 04:09:41 2015 UTC,"Also, DPs denouncement of ""Black people should stop committing so much crime"" as racist is worthy of scorn.   Would you not denounce something like ""Asian people should fucking stop killing and eating so many dogs"" as racist?"
drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,Jonix55,0,Sun Jul 5 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"Is it a fact that Asians eat significantly more dog than any other group?  Am I opposed to the consumption of dog?

drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,Vivendo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:42:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but by the way I worded it that would be widely considered a racist statement.

drunkenpeasants,3c5q9r,Jonix55,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"There's nothing racist about acknowledging measurable, factual differences between the behaviors of different ethnic groups. You're either in denial, or you consider facts to be racist.   But while we're on the subject, I don't approve of AiU's recent activity. My original post was made prior to (or at least prior to me seeing) his twitter meltdown and doc dropping of CC. His inability to attack ideas, and lowering himself to ""internet tough guy"" status, is deplorable, and is to be denounced.   Additionally, I wasn't aware of how deep down the conspiratorial rabbit hole he was. He may very well actually be racist, which is to be condemned."

Just something about alot of these Patreon guests and feeling the need to filter almost everything they say in a podcast where vulgarity and quirkiness is the main draw is kind of amusing.

TJ himself mocks the people defending him by sarcastically pretending to be bullied by Ben and Scotty because he knows it's all in good fun.   Plus, just because they wouldn't be where they are without TJ doesn't mean he deserves special rights in not being allowed to be insulted by Ben or Scotty."
drunkenpeasants,3aucnt,dangerousmute,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"There's no serious intent behind any of the insults thrown around between the three. As you say, it is all in good fun. I think TJ is better at sarcasm than both Ben and Scotty. There's times when Ben or Scotty wants to complain about something that TJ does irl or something, and you'd think they were sincere about it. Especially Scotty, he can seem very uptight sometimes. When the tables are reversed however, Scotty is quick to throw the ""man, fuck you, TJ!"" mantra around.  Ben is often accusing TJ of being ""full of shit"". I recall a moment when TJ said that Brits had bad teeth during the episode where Sargon of Akkad was on. Ben took issue with that and said ""Don't even go there with that stereotype!"". It was great when Sargon of Akkad actually backed TJ up. The Brits do have a poor dental healthcare, so it's not entirely inaccurate."

No one who commented on it agreed with me, and the comments against what I said were the ones that were upvoted.   However, DP have mentioned what was said in that post multiple times in the last few episodes, even saying ""People on the subreddit are going crazy"". Really, DP?

Even after organizing events that banned white people and the #KillAllWhiteMen tweet, Bahar Mustafa still held her position as the diversity officer at a university. I'm pretty sure organizing events that ban a race from attending is completely illegal in Britain, but it's white people that are banned, so she's obviously not going to get any criticism. This isn't feminism, but I'm sure this woman would have gladly banned men from an event, and I'm damn sure this woman labels herself as a feminist."

The a vocal minority have worked their way into academia and the mainstream news, they've also done similar things the Atheist community. Remember the Atheist Plus movement?  Edit: As I come back to this comment, even now, I'm not even sure if this group is still considered a minority. The scale at which they've affected things is quite different from what you'd expect.

drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,Mr-Miles,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"If you taunt the mods, you're gonna get banned, that's just how it fucking goes.  Don't come in trying to start shit and you'll be fine.  IF you really did nothing wrong,  give me the nick you were using and i'll check the logs for it."
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,thatzacguy,2,Sun Jun 21 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"""Whitepeoplemeetdotcom"" You can check the logs to see I'm right. Not really upset I was banned, just wanted to point out he is a dick. I'm not too interested in the chat anyway bro. I just went on because I was curious."
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,Mr-Miles,0,Sun Jun 21 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"you're a liar. UnFunny doesn't ban people for confronting him on anything unless they're breaking the rules. And BTW, more proof that you're a liar or have no idea what you're talking about. I am the one that banned someone for saying ""Fuck the rules"", not UnFunny. There is no obvious reason for you to make shit up but you are obviously doing it."
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,thatzacguy,2,Mon Jun 22 00:21:03 2015 UTC,"Well why would you ban him for that? That's not fucking cool dude. He was just joking around when he said that. When I fucking stood up for him you faggots banned me. You guys are sketchy as hell, and you know it. I'm leaving you guys alone. Trust me. I only posted this because it is relevant to DP. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to hear from you guys, or draw any attention towards you. Homefully you'll have something better to do than get mad at Chad from reddit."
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,thatzacguy,2,Mon Jun 22 06:41:36 2015 UTC,Got banned for pretty much the same thing too. Called them out for banning a guy for no good reason and got banned. That chat is a joke and will be dead very soon
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,thatzacguy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Unfunny got mad when people asked if he had a job, and got even more mad when asked if he was a virgin. Literally started making up a bunch of stuff like saying his penis is 11 inches and he hooks up with male pornstars. He also claimed he knew fluent Spanish even though he didn't have the patience or intelligence to finish highschool. Really all I did was stand for someone who was banned for no reason. I was being friendly with unfunny the whole time despite him being a douche and a compulsive liar."
drunkenpeasants,3acqmr,MissMoth,0,Thu Jun 25 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"If you go anywhere and tell them ""Fuck your rules"" and then you get kicked out.. Don't act so damned surprised over it. Besides he didn't even stay banned you ignorant fuck head.  He was also trying to see how far he could go without getting banned. skirting the line, so to speak. He had been doing that before he said ""Fuck your rules"", he already had the mods attention for being a troublemaker. Please do stay out of our chat. If you can't understand why the rules are in place, then you shouldn't be there."

Spending millions of dollars to launch a fat retard into space seems like an enormous waste, and he will be photon torpedo'ed by the church of Gail anyway.

On that show he was all like ""fuck you!"" and calling TJ a retard and even telling Ben to eat shit and die. He was even like ""I want to be on your show so I can settle this once and for all!"", talking a big game and stuff like that. But when he's actually on, he says fuck all and just lays down and takes it like a bitch, sucking their dicks like ""oh you guys are right I'm garbage."" What a spineless fuck. I thought they were a little too mean to him at first, but not after watching that."
drunkenpeasants,3a51cy,flyingveggiemonster,12,Wed Jun 17 22:36:44 2015 UTC,Why disappointed? It was funny AF.  The guy copies DP's format then comes on the show just to get abused and ridiculed.
drunkenpeasants,3a51cy,zuk1,8,Wed Jun 17 11:06:06 2015 UTC,"But that makes DP funny, not him. He just stood there and did fuck all. At least with Fishhead, I could pretend he may be a okay person to know. If I had The UnFunny Comedian as a friend, I would probably kill myself. That's coming from someone who's been struggling with Depression and Suicide. That would literally be the last straw."

drunkenpeasants,3a51cy,joeykainradisafaggot,4,Wed Jun 17 16:18:08 2015 UTC,Fishhead has the charisma of Adolf Hitler compared to Unfunny Comedian. Nobody should use the IRC chat due to his complete and utter garbageness.

He's definitely had a somewhat of an influence on me I would say.  Then again I don't think I could ever say this person or that person has been the most influential in my life, I'm not really fanatic about people like that. It's just not that black and white, at least for me.  I don't know if TJ how much it was TJ influencing my opinions or just that TJ's opinions resonated very well with my own for the most part, I tend to think the latter.

You're strawmanning is more pathetic than anything I said.   LOL this is pure projection. I never wrote nor implied the word pathetic at all on this thread. I found it amusing that you picked Tj.

drunkenpeasants,39rdgo,ltt22716,2,Sun Jun 14 00:33:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Libertarian means Anarchist in the UK. Libertarian Socialism is just an offspring of Anarchism and the term Libertarian isn't really used in the UK other than Libertarian Socialism. Libertarian is interchangeable with Classic Liberalism in the UK.

I do worry about much larger subreddits though. I wasn't a fan of /r/fatpeoplehate but I believed they should have had every right to be a community. I'm aware Reddit is privately owned and can do whatever it wants but the idea of Reddit was free speech and getting ideas across.

Steve Shives' opinions on feminism are definitely contrary to the DPs, but he's not especially interesting as a character. I don't think he fits the bill for what the DPs look for in a video.  If you want someone to dissect Shives, Teal Deer has started going through his videos, though TL;DR is a bit long winded (though thorough)."
drunkenpeasants,394vez,Vivendo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:19:09 2015 UTC,What about all the feminists that DP have responded to?

I don't know why they bother with Ryan. Didn't he initiate their interactions by making reply videos to them?  It's not unthinkable that they'd cover Steve, I just don't think his take on feminism is that interesting. It's run of the mill Atheism+ caliber shite."

drunkenpeasants,394vez,zuk1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"I have always wondered the same thing.  Steve has a significant following and his views on feminism are horrible. Ryan Wiley kinda guy. You can't say DP doesn't take on Steve because he is bornig, they fucking cover Ryan Wiley, The most boring man in the world! I think the main reason they don't cover Steve is because he is friends with The Bible Reloaded. Steve has been a guest on TBR videos before. However, I hope that is not the reason bc That would suck dick!"
drunkenpeasants,394vez,ermac91,2,Tue Jun 9 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"No, they wouldn't abstain from him just because of that. They probably just haven't heard of him enough to bring him on. He's also not as dumb as Ryan Wiley, nor extreme enough in any degree to worth commenting on."
drunkenpeasants,394vez,myjeren,2,Wed Jun 10 04:35:41 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard of him? dude you are an idiot. Steve Shives has about the same about of subs TL;DR has. He is buddies with TBR and The Creationist Cat. Steve Shives runs ""The Breakfast Club"" channel, where DP got the videos of InfidelAvenger (fat guy claiming to have taken down The grinchdub video from TAA channel, and keeping TJ's ED page) On top of all these Coughlan is always tweeting Steve's videos. There is no fucking way they don't know who Steve Shive is. They are definitely avoiding responding to Steve for diplomatic reasons, just as they are avoiding responding to Justicar/Integralmath bc he is too smart for DP. Im a fan of DP, but they are fucking pussies taking only on easy targets like Gman, Brett, Ryan moron Wiley and Creationist dipshits."
drunkenpeasants,394vez,inputgatin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"Explain why they targeted Howard Bloom just recently? There have been plenty of cases where they criticize those that they would generally like. And just because Steve Shives appears in those circles, doesn't mean that they've heard of him (enough). TJ and Scotty most likely haven't heard of him, and Ben might have in seeing everyone request that his videos be on there.   Also, calm down next time you reply to someone. You can only get vicious when you're right."

A good example was the religion debate video and how he can smoothly embarrass evangelicals while also being funny.   With Gman though, I get the opposite effect. Everytime TJ or Ben suggests getting Gman on, I let out an audible ""Why? The show was going just fine."" And then we get the routine   ""Hey Gman, what are you up to?"" where he then responds ""Not much guys, just got done doing another 50 hr hangout that no one is gonna watch."" Then TJ or Ben say ""That's cool. Hey Gman, fuck Brett Keane right? HAHAH Let's talk about him again instead of calling you out on your stupid beliefs.""

drunkenpeasants,374226,Fairy_Nightmare,9,Sun May 24 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"2 points to add being that I am kind of a Drunken Peasants insider.   Ben does own the www.drunkenpeasants.com domain but for now, it redirects to the podbean site. He has stated at least 2 times to me that he is trying to get a site going but I have heard nothing in a while. I do not know the nature of what the site is going to be. I would not want to see another Not Productive scenario. Where they try and get a website but fail since they get the wrong guys involved and end up wasting lots of money. I think it would be very bad for the channel to try to take on a project like that when even TJ could not get a slightly larger project out with way more money behind him. And before anyone says that TJ could use his Youtube money for DP, he doesn't and I doubt he could spare it. Ben would of payed me for the work if they had other methods of income other than Patreon and Youtube. Seeing as Ben couldn't pay me with just Youtube money. I doubt he could completely build a website to host content, take thousands of hits per week, and bring in revenue on just Patreon money. I also doubt that Ben would like the fact that they wont be on youtube anymore and this would remove them from getting random hits from suggested videos. I don't think that an independant site will be able to gain the views that would be sustainable to keep going. Even Thatguywiththeglasses couldn't do it and they have way more content and way more fans that DP and even TJ/   Overall I don't think it will happen and I don't think it is the only logical way from here. The only one I can see is disputing the copyright case by saying the clip is protected under fair use. Maybe Ben could post in /r/copyright and see what he and DP should do."

That's at least what I understood was happening.   Either way, I enjoy listening to JF explain the facts about evolution. He is great with words and explains things in a way even a dummy like me could understand. Haha."
drunkenpeasants,32lpyr,Kittenismybaby,6,Wed Apr 15 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"I ain't a big fan of the debates, but I think JF was really looking forward to it. He seemed sorta bummed the entire episode, but that could be due to other reasons."
drunkenpeasants,32lpyr,Lord_Jeebus,3,Wed Apr 15 03:30:06 2015 UTC,Sorry about my English and grammar but here goes nothing:  While I personally agree with you on how repetitive this whole creationist debate thing is I think that we should remember that not everyone has been convinced. I think that its a very few minority in the atheist community who actually grew up atheist. Most of us probably came from some sort of religious background. I don't see the point of the debate as convincing the creatard that he's wrong but reaching mostly young people that are trying to figure things out for themselves. Hopefully by still having the debates and other things that keep this discussion alive more people will continue to break away from religion when they see how silly their apologist looks in the face of sound logic and reason.  In brief I don't see the goal of the debate to convert the creationist but the on looker that has a brain in their head and needs to be encouraged to use it and not seccumb to the bull shit of religious dogma
drunkenpeasants,32lpyr,kingpokey,3,Wed Apr 15 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Hopefully by still having the debates and other things that keep this discussion alive more people will continue to break away from religion when they see how silly their apologist looks in the face of sound logic and reason.   I didn't think about that but I guess it makes sense. But I still stick with the idea that creationists, whether they're the ones debating or not, will never change their mind without personally getting educated.  I was once a creationist, evangelical christian by choice -- yes I was exposed to religion but it was me who became the religious nut -- and I managed to let go of my idiocy because of actually sitting down in a biology classroom and learning the concepts and ideas better. Most creation-evolution debates don't teach the audience biology or physics, it's mainly composed of a creationist offering their ""evidence"" and the biologist just refuting it. Yes, the biologist might say something Creationist Joe --audience member I just made up--hasn't heard of before, but since Joe doesn't even understand the basic concepts it doesn't leave quite the desired impact. Joe could just brush it off as more ""scientist conspiracy"".  So I don't even think an audience member would be effected heavily by an online, Youtube debate. If the creationist does poorly it's supposedly just because they're not a good debator, but if a creationist does well or doesn't back down then ""God was on their side""."
drunkenpeasants,32lpyr,olbleedyeyes,3,Wed Apr 15 01:22:44 2015 UTC,I like JF. But it's hard to have him as a guest because he kinda just sits back and waits for the more intellectual topics to pop up. So for the most part he keeps quiet. Hope he gets his debate soon.

drunkenpeasants,32ah84,xGiBbYv,12,Sun Apr 12 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"I... don't like it. I'm not sure I can pinpoint what is wrong about it but I feel like if the creator was to take a few hours away from editing and come back and look at it they'll see what I'm seeing. Let me have a go anyway...  The pacing feels wrong, like the clip of ""hey man, got a joint"" sticks around so long that it doesn't feel like part of a montage. The wait at the start is just unnecessary tedium. The EQ graphic at the start is so lonely. It's all just so bare and gray. The volume of whatever Scotty says in that cartoon is far too high which accentuates how out of place it feels. TJ's laughter at the end isn't linked to anything on screen so could be confused as being ""live"" sound. The ""Ben And TJ"" graphics coming up the exact same way both times looks lazy.  I also kinda hate how Ryan Whiney is the first thing we see, gross. Uhh, can anyone else help me out ?"
drunkenpeasants,32ah84,LazyDinosaur,4,Sun Apr 12 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"Just some context, I am the maker and the semi-official graphics designer of DP by volunteering. Sadly no pay.   I am really glad someone has told me what is wrong with it. Because I will need it when I go back to edit it. I have a few points of my own to add to kind of address some worries you have.  Firstly, I did not say, this should be seen as a draft. It is sloppy and it  (In my opinion) lacks from my first draft. Sadly Ben did not like him saying ""Scared to eat the ass nigga!"" which allowed me use other clips at a better pace towards the end. You can see the first draft here It also has a quicker intro too which I also want shortening down. But I think I want to keep it if I can. Half the timing on it though.  I was hoping what Scotty said was going to be audible out of context. It is when TJ and Scotty have the ""Hang 'em high"" redneck rant. I don't know why it is so loud but again, something to look for when I go back into editing. I have to switch between two programs when editing. After Effects for all the visuals and Sony Vegas for audio and encoding. So it gets hard trying to get it to work.   The ""Hey man, got a joint?"" Section is in the audio itself. Since DP started, it has been there. So there is nothing I can do with that than building everything off that. I don't know what you want me to do there but please do tell.  Other than that, i agree. Because it is unfinished and lazy because it don't want it to be the finished version but Ben wanted an intro and I wanted the new graphics I have put a lot of time into to be used for one. Mainly because I hate the old job I did.   Thanks (Not so) /u/LazyDinosaur for pointing out the issues I could not put my finger on myself.  PS, Any suggestions of a DP opponent that isn't repulsive and they will replace Ryan Whiney in a second."

drunkenpeasants,32ah84,xXRandomYoXx,2,Sun Apr 12 10:47:04 2015 UTC,I like it but like /u/LazyDinosaur the timing is off. Though the faces of some crazies blowing up was a nice touch.
drunkenpeasants,32ah84,JeremyKean,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"Well I like it better than the original. The first one reminds me of old videos done in Windows' Movie Maker where the creator was just like ""40 different visual effects?! Let's see how many I can cram into one video!"" Only in the DP one, it's like:   ""Lets see how many visual effects I can run this ugly noisy orange background through. And here's a lense flare! And here's.....a wisp of smoke? Yeah! Smoke! FUCK YEAH! How bout I bend an improperly synced audio wave form along side the background! Sweeeeet. Alright now here's a blurry montage played with the semi-transparent background running over it.""  It's ugly, it's noisy (visually noisy), it's out of sync. For the first intro they've had, it's pretty great. But it's like the scratch vocals of intros. It's long overdue for a polished version.  I love you Bengazi, though, don't be mad, xoxoxoxoxoxo <4"

drunkenpeasants,31v6b9,xGiBbYv,2,Wed Apr 8 14:45:15 2015 UTC,How come they didn't upload it?  The graphics look really good by the way!
drunkenpeasants,31v6b9,Jonix55,2,Wed Apr 8 14:56:15 2015 UTC,Well I'm not Ben so I don't have a clear understanding.   They may release that stuff but I think it was done like the shows and under the Broken Pixels. They had bigged it up around when the show was around the #30-40s I think. Remembering that we got shows almost weekly and the podcast was at least half a year old by this point. The overlays were based off the first overlay I did and what was being used at the time. Here is a look at them. It is outdated now so I would not hold my breath.  I think for the reason it went down the pan (hehe) was just TJ being busy. Seems to be the only thing Ben told me at the time. I get that a lot from Ben all the time. It seems like Scotty and TJ are very busy people and it is sad that it stopped something new being created.  Aw thanks! We recently re did quite a lot of the graphics for DP too. I finalised it yesterday so do look out for it. Maybe even on today's show! The Drunken Wrestling Podcast intro is based off what the new designs are. I do hope that now I have do something that Ben will use fully. He has been sticking to the old stuff even when I do give him new channel art and avatars. This new change will also the first time I did a DP intro for the show (Other than the DP is War and DWP ones which were one show only) Though that is still unfinished. So don't expect that this week at all.

I don't have 3 hours to devote in front of a computer screen, so at least I don't have to donwload/convert/put episodes on my phone anymore. It'd be nice if the pre and post shows were worth a damn."
drunkenpeasants,31h9op,ColinOnReddit,6,Sun Apr 5 04:54:47 2015 UTC,"I think Ben should stop being a lazy fuck and upload the unedited versions to another site like Vimeo, I know for sure that that's what everyone has been asking for in the comments of YouTube and Facebook every time they get a copyright claim. I gotta agree with Colin though, downloading the audio only version is pointless. Those and the patreon shows kind of remind me of exclusive DLC in video games for some reason, at least they don't charge you for the audio only version but I wouldn't be surprised if they stopped doing that."

They only play the videos in the queue but don't comment or react to them for the whole show (Just to spite the DP clones, I'm sure they also wouldn't do this)   It would just make it boring, wouldn't it?   TJ plays the sensible/reasonable one, Ben becomes loud/obnoxious, and Scotty agrees with/defends everyone in the videos they're reacting too.   Fuck yeah!

I've been subbed to him for a few years now and he never really had a goal for his channel, even now, he's done like 3 videos asking what we wanted his content to be, then making a 4th video saying he will do as he please.  I kinda understand the frustration of not knowing what he wants to do, and if his beliefs are that suicide is acceptable, so be it. If it is to be in the spotlight or not, I don't know, I never cared enough to follow blogs and shit."
