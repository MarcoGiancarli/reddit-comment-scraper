thecutestidol,345kwj,Tactical_Moonstone,1 point,Wed May 6 08:06:33 2015 UTC,"My learning is one weird patchwork. It's a combination of in-class learning (starting Intermediate 2 next Saturday), prior independent learning (Minna no Nihongo: up to chapter 34), and whatever I can grab from playing, of all things, a dating simulator (I record all events in this blog)  I also adapted my prior knowledge of Chinese characters (2nd language is Chinese) to quickly expand my vocabulary. I still have to learn some, though, since my knowledge of Chinese characters was only limited to Simplified and some Hong Kong Traditional Chinese characters1.   However, when it comes to translation, I am rather heavy-handed on localisation.   According to JLPT, N5 is the ability to understand some basic Japanese, including basic kanji (up to 100 unique kanji used2). I'm pretty sure my vocabulary is way beyond N5, but my overall skills would probably place me before that.   1Taiwan Traditional Chinese characters are structurally different from those from Hong Kong/pre-simplification China; they are closer to Japanese kanji.   2Which does not include most of the kanji found in the picture series: this 100-kanji list is very restrictive."

He didn't bother with the whole album (sadface) but he did translate and typeset this! As far as I know, he didn't even release this online and only gave it to me, so I'll just link his translation wordpress instead (keep in mind he's on hiatus til his Japanese is better)  Wordpress Link  I suggest clicking the RinPana tag and read Osario and Christmasnya~"
