texas,3e2clw,TooOldToBeHere,23,Tue Jul 21 12:35:07 2015 UTC,My recently widowed mother in law is finding this out the hard way.  Her retirement is worse than social security and she isn't going to receive any death benefits from my father in law since he died about 1 year too young.  Very shitty situation for someone who worked for 30 years thinking all was well.
texas,3e2clw,rotating_equipment,6,Tue Jul 21 13:34:00 2015 UTC,She does get social security in addition to the retirement doesn't she? Those of us in private industry dont typically get retirement
texas,3e2clw,pouponstoops,33,Tue Jul 21 14:25:02 2015 UTC,"No, teachers do not receive social security (at least, in Texas).  Teachers contribute to TRS, which is the Teachers Retirement System of Texas.  They do not contribute to Social Security, so they do not receive Social Security.  Source: Wife is a teacher in Texas."
texas,3e2clw,trudat,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"Some teachers in Texas receive Social Security. It depends on whether the district pays into both TRS and SS, like Dallas ISD, or does not, like Fort Worth ISD and most other districts."
texas,3e2clw,TiptoeingThruTonight,7,Tue Jul 21 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  My wife has worked in 3 different districts ranging from medium to very large, and none of those districts contributed to social security.  I didn't realize there were; I figured it was the same across the state."
texas,3e2clw,trudat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"If teachers can spend the last few years of their careers in DISD, they can substantially improve their retirements."
texas,3e2clw,TiptoeingThruTonight,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"Can you explain the math that would make that a reality?  If someone only spends a few years contributing to SS, wouldn't their benefits be very low accordingly?"
texas,3e2clw,MimosaTexas,5,Tue Jul 21 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"Some contribution is better than none.  But I would agree, it would take more than just a few years to improve them substantially... I'd need to see the math to back it up.  Edit: Don't you need 40 quarters (10 years) of contribution in order to be eligible to receive social security without being deemed disabled?"
texas,3e2clw,trudat,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, this works best for people who have already paid into SS, either from an earlier career or through part-time jobs. Since it doesn't affect me, I haven't looked into it very much."
texas,3e2clw,TiptoeingThruTonight,4,Tue Jul 21 16:02:49 2015 UTC,DISD does not pay into SS
texas,3e2clw,maxorama,3,Tue Jul 21 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've seen DISD employees say that it did, but that was several years ago. It's not on this list, http://www.atpe.org/en/Advocacy/Issues/Texas-Public-School-Districts-That-Participate-in, so I guess they no longer participate."
texas,3e2clw,TiptoeingThruTonight,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"I think there used to be a loophole that allowed teachers to contribute by other means, and this was changed."
texas,3e2clw,trudat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yes - my Mom did this. If you ""worked"" your last day at a school district that paid into SS and then retired, you could draw both your TRS retirement and your spouse's SS. Ridiculous that my father could have worked and paid into SS for 35 years and my mom would not have been able to draw any benefits. AFAIK, the loophole has since been closed."
texas,3e2clw,haley_joel_osteen,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"This is very uncommon, though. Not a single district around me is this way."
texas,3e2clw,smeggysmeg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the first I've heard of a district contributing to social security, and my wife has been teaching for 10 years."

texas,3e2clw,HandBananaHammock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"It was recently changed to the average of the five best years if you were hired after 2005 and did not have 5 years of service credit with TRS prior to Sept 1, 2014.  Also, it is not 80 percent of the salary.  It is 2.3% multiplied by the years of service. So for 30 years of service it is only 69%.   At that rate a teacher averages $50,000 for their final salaries they will receive $34,500 per year. While if it was 80% it would be $40,000."
texas,3e2clw,ccarter_az,0,Tue Jul 21 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"Isn't is last 5 years, and not best 5 years.  Though typically your last 5 will be your best, but not necessarily."
texas,3e2clw,trudat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:13 2015 UTC,Last time I was on the TRS site it was best 5....  Edit: Found it!   you will have your monthly  annuity calculated using the  average of your highest five  annual salaries (based on  creditable compensation) and  according to the standard  annuity benefit formula in  effect when you retire.
texas,3e2clw,Talran,88,Tue Jul 21 21:03:17 2015 UTC,"For a teacher to insure his or her spouse under the Teacher Retirement System plan last year, a first-year teacher making state base would have had to spend almost 40% of his or her gross pay on insurance alone. That's for the barebones plan. For the middle-of-the-road plan, he or she would have had to fork out between 45-50% of his or her gross pay for health insurance.  Frankly, though there are still great teachers, young and old, in Texas schools, the overall quality will continue to decline. You can't expect our best and brightest prospective teachers to undertake a career in which they're doomed to serve as political and cultural punching bags, working a thankless, difficult job for really offensively low compensation. The tests, the SBoE textbook farces, the low pay and awful insurance, the hours, the out-of-pocket purchase of supplies, the public distrust and constant criticism, the lack of meaningful involvement in campus decision making or paths for real professional development. These are not the conditions Texans should want for our teachers, and, if they persist (or, more likely, degrade further) fewer and fewer bright young people or experienced and competent veterans will sign up to do it at all."
texas,3e2clw,1261644,25,Tue Jul 21 13:17:43 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that pay and insurance vary district to district. My wife is a teacher and makes decent money and pays $0 monthly for health insurance. I don't know what it would cost me to be insured though as I've never needed it.
texas,3e2clw,kerklein2,6,Tue Jul 21 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"It's true that pay and benefits vary from district to district because, even though every aspect of their professional lives are heavily regulated by the state, from certification to classroom management to curricula, they are not considered state employees. This is one of the main reasons that correctional officers with no experience and no higher education are guaranteed far better benefits than a teacher.  If your wife were to add you to her plan last year, it would have cost your family a minimum of $525 per month. If you sprung for the middle-of-the-road plan, you'd be looking at a cost closer to $800 per month. And this is the situation for a teacher lucky enough to be in a generous district that picks up teachers' premiums. There may be districts that will contribute to spouse premiums, but I'm not aware of any.  Even in districts that pay above state base, promising young teachers must choose to make sacrifices themselves and ask the same of their families to teach rather than pursue a different career. The problem with that is that we're pushing a lot of potentially great teachers out of our classrooms where they'd really like to be.  Some teachers find a good situation in well-funded districts on exemplary campuses, but the fact remains that a first-year Texas teacher is guaranteed only about $27,000 in salary with no guaranteed benefits, not even health insurance."
texas,3e2clw,1261644,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"I was just pointing out that your statements were not universal across the state, that's all.  Her district pays $43,000 for a first year teacher. And adding me would cost $502/mo."
texas,3e2clw,kerklein2,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Good god, that's starting to get up into the price range of rent or a mortgage.  Health care costs are out of control, and that's where something needs to be done (maybe cutting out the middlemen is a start)."

I ask because I've taught in two of the better paying districts in Houston and Austin and they paid much less than that. Were they also supplementing their income coaching or bus driving?  60K is normally what teachers with 25+ yrs of experience get
texas,3e2clw,jyonk1109,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"One near Houston, one near DFW, one in east tx and another in Lubbock.  The one in Lubbock is the only one that supplemented his income.  The one near DFW had the district paying for part of his mortgage."

She has a masters and is fluent in both Spanish and English and teaches/tests children with disabilities. I don't know where your friends work but I've never in my life heard of anyone starting out with that kind of pay in Texas.

texas,3e2clw,evannever,6,Tue Jul 21 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"It does vary by district.  It also continues to get worse and worse, regardless of district.  My wife has seen worse benefits and frozen or decreasing raises every year she has been a teacher, and has switched districts in an effort to regain some of those lost benefits....only to see the new district follow suit.  It is literally half as expensive for me to get considerably better health benefits from Obamacare than to add on through my wife.  That doesn't make any sense to me...  That said, my wife loves her job and would not want to do anything else, and the 60-70 hour work week and all the money she spends out of pocket for her students is worth it to her in the end."
texas,3e2clw,MimosaTexas,5,Tue Jul 21 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"Here's why, it's covering all the older people in the plan.  It's the same for me as a state worker. My insurance costs almost 1k more a month than if I got a comparable plan through the ACA.  It's also self managed and they don't pay out shit either. We just have so many old people hanging on, poof there goes the money."
texas,3e2clw,fu2mod,7,Tue Jul 21 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"Newsflash, it continues to get worse for almost every profession, not just teachers."
texas,3e2clw,DrunkenArmadillo,7,Tue Jul 21 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"I used my teacher spouse's insurance last year. Coverage just for me adds at least $500 per month to the monthly premiums. This year, I'm going to switch to a private plan to save $200-250 per month in premiums."
texas,3e2clw,TiptoeingThruTonight,34,Tue Jul 21 15:23:10 2015 UTC,Excellent points that a lot of people are unaware of. I work for a larger district in the DFW area and can only afford to insure myself and my daughter. If I were to add my wife to the plan it would jump from $450 per month to over $900 a month for the middle tier plan and we'd still have to meet an $8000 deductible before we start to actually see any benefits. This plus the state's decision to end the required annual pay increases is going to end up driving a ton of great teachers away from the profession in this state. It's disheartening.
texas,3e2clw,slurmwich,25,Tue Jul 21 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"Well put.  Teaching is one of the most important professions in our society.    The problem is that a large part of the Republican party in Austin wants to kill public education.

I do think we could stand to pay experienced teachers better. As it stands brand new and 20 years experience aren't really that far apart but I don't think the state needs to fork over more money.

It seems on par with most other policies I've seen. Teachers who don't pay into SSN, don't receive SSN benefits. The TRS system they do pay into is quite generous, and I would absolutely trade my SSN benefits for TRS benefits."

I am done hearing these ridiculous ""wowess me"" stories from a state that continuously votes in ASSSHOLE GOP Governor's that continue to muck-up Texas education.  Gradually Spending has been getting worse and worse.  The link below shows a decline in Public Education Spending while enrollment continues to GROW and GROW over the past 3 years.  The article claims the decline came from recession but Texas business and economic growth has continued to boom through the recession and the money is still not going back to public education.   http://fastexas.org/about/spending.php  The GOP has had 20 years of governorship and has been more focused on putting ""GOD"" back into schools and creating lies in text books instead of making the best use of current funds.  Everybody inside Texas always looks at failures in other states and blames it on UNIONS, well TEXAS, you don't have a teachers union and you still keep your teachers just at the poverty line.  Teachers should be outraged and organizing full blown walk-outs!  But they don't.  If Texas doesn't figure out their education spending and problems now, its only going to continue to create a huge divide between the have's and have-not's because in the next 20 years, Texas is going to be double in population and not from Illegal immigrants that Texans are always complaining about, but from babies being born by legal immigrants.  http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21646202-rise-latinos-huge-opportunity-united-states-must-not-squander-it-how-fire-up   Those who whip up border fever are wrong on the facts. The southern frontier has never been harder to cross. Recent Hispanic population growth has mostly been driven by births, not fresh immigration. Even if the borders could somehow be sealed and every unauthorized migrant deported—which would be cruel and impossible—some 48m legally resident Hispanics would remain. Latino growth will not be stopped.   So when Texans stop voting for the same male-centric arrogant, clearly uneducated, born with a silver spoon up their ass governors, I might start shedding a tear for teachers and the public Education system.  Start looking at candidates that actually use facts and numbers to show you the changes that can be done to improve education and spending for all, Teachers and Students."

Teachers in the public sector have a lot of power in this country, more so without Unions.  What are parents/voters going to do when every public school is shut down because teachers just choose not to show up?  I would be shocked if there are that many Temp Teachers to cover every teacher in the state of Texas.  Do you know how many parents will have to suddenly stay home from work or worse, take their kids to work?  What do you think they are going to vote for when a walk out lasts an extended period of time? And yes, to a certain degree, I do blame victims that continue to stay in a Masochistic situation over and over and over again.  Hence voting for the same type governor for the past 20 years."

I would not be surprised if that goes doubly for government employees. (Yes, you're right it's possible to do something like the Arab Spring - but that required mass mobilization of the population as a whole, not just one special interest group like teachers.)  And what exactly are you blaming the teachers for here? Most of them don't vote for the Republicans. Most of them don't have the freedom to just choose to move to another state and get jobs there (especially depending on their family situation). And as I've pointed out, they don't have the power to just unilaterally change the way teachers are compensated in the state."

But they don't and legally cannot do what unions do best: facilitate collective bargaining. So they're not really unions in a meaningful sense.

Now with Abbott appointing this new lady to the public education post, I think we're likely to see things get worse. Her resume doesn't show a lot (or really any) support of public education.    Collective bargaining wouldn't solve the issue here in Texas. It might help but the organization's that lobby can't get over the hump to do anything meaningful. A strike is damn near impossible with the number of teachers floating around and the new graduates that are resorting to subbing while they search for careers in their field.   A strike would only facilitate the new directors views that home schooling is more appropriate for kids and likely result in some sort of state funded voucher for religous home schooling (already ruled unconstitutional in other states, but let's not kid ourselves...this is Texas we're talking about. They wouldn't shy away from it).   A strike might even jump start the program with the administration citing the strike as the reason to implement this new plan immediately."

texas,3e3whw,ConcedeDota,4,Tue Jul 21 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"Full article:  New Texas textbooks, tailored to state standards that downplay the role of slavery in the Civil War and omit mention of Jim Crow laws or the Ku Klux Klan, are drawing criticism again as the nation grapples with its racial history. By portraying slavery as merely one of several factors pushing Southern states to secede, and by focusing on states’ rights as a primary cause, the standards fail to present a clear and accurate picture of the Civil War, some historians, educators and activists say. Textbooks based on those standards will be used in some of San Antonio’s biggest school districts. The controversy has flared anew as legislators, educators and others take steps to remove Confederate symbols on public display across the South after nine black worshippers were fatally shot in Charleston, South Carolina. That state’s governor signed a bill Thursday to take down the Confederate flag from its pole on the statehouse grounds. An effort to remove statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and two of his generals at the University of Texas at Austin has gained steam. MORE INFORMATION Comparing documents On the causes of the Civil War, the State Board of Education voted in 2010 that Texas high school students should read this: Jefferson Davis' Inaugural Address February 1861 Number of sentences: 51 Number of sentences that mention race or slavery: 0 “... Through many years of controversy with our late associates, the Northern States, we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquillity and obtain respect for the rights to which we were entitled. As a necessity, not a choice we have resorted to separation ...” But not this: A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union February 1861 Number of sentences: 33 Number of sentences that mention race or slavery: 19 “... the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States ... demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races ... We hold as undeniable truths that ... the servitude of the African race ... is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator ...” The only right that Southern states were fighting for was the right to own slaves, say critics of the textbooks, comparing their portrayal of the Civil War’s causes as a distortion comparable to the way the statues and flags honor a racist heritage. The State Board of Education adopted the standards in May 2010 on a 9-5 vote after a bitter debate, with Republican board members voting for them, saying they would rectify liberal bias in the way Texas taught history. Democrats voted against the standards. “There would be those who would say, you know, automatically say the reason for the Civil War was over slavery,” board member Patricia Hardy, R-Fort Worth, said during one meeting. “No. It was states’ rights.” The standards also don’t require textbooks to include material on Jim Crow laws that perpetuated segregation or on the Ku Klux Klan. But the Texas Education Agency said a review showed that publishers on the list of textbooks the board approved last fall did include those subjects in their books. Last year, facing renewed criticism about the standards, the board’s chairwoman, Barbara Cargill, R-The Woodlands, said the new materials were “much more fair and balanced than they were before.” Some districts have chosen to pick books that are off the state’s approved list, taking advantage of a 2011 state law that gave districts more freedom in purchasing books. Most districts still buy books from the list. Textbooks remain an important resource, but teachers rely on their training and judgment, said Steve Antley, a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Houston Independent School District, the state’s largest. The district is ordering state-approved social studies textbooks from the publishing company Pearson for middle school use but is no longer buying printed textbooks for its high schools, instead using online materials, spokeswoman Holly Huffman said. “I don’t think there’s really the danger that some agenda can be pushed into (the standards) and that’s somehow going to impact all the kids in Texas,” said Antley, who represents HISD educators as president of the Congress of Houston Teachers. “In the end, teachers are still making decisions about how to teach the course.” Leslie Price, San Antonio Independent School District spokeswoman, said the district adopted state-approved social studies textbooks for both middle and high school. Northeast Independent School District also follows the state-approved list of social studies textbooks, spokeswoman Aubrey Chancellor said."

Both have the same goals in mind but where their revenue is spent may be completely different. A seemingly less important distinction could have been which brand of mac and cheese you wanted. Who needs more than Kraft, right? Well up until, what? 2007? Buying Kraft would have been lining the pockets of Philip-Morris. Choice is really the only way someone could avoid that in most circumstances. There's really no way to arbitrarily make choices for people without corruption or having a corporatocracy.

Well up until, what? 2007? Buying Kraft would have been lining the pockets of Philip-Morris. Choice is really the only way someone could avoid that in most circumstances.   Do you really have a choice, though?   Anyways, Sanders was using consumer overchoice to describe how messed-up our national priorities have become under crony capitalism. He wasn't advocating an artificial limitation on how many varieties of [product] should be on the shelves, but arguing that it would be OK if his policies for reducing income inequality meant a reduction in the rate of economic growth for the top 1%.    HARWOOD: If the changes that you envision in tax policy, in finance, breaking up the banks, were to result in a more equitable distribution of income, but less economic growth, is that trade-off worth making? SANDERS: Yes. If 99 percent of all the new income goes to the top 1 percent, you could triple it, it wouldn't matter much to the average middle class person. The whole size of the economy and the GDP doesn't matter if people continue to work longer hours for low wages and you have 45 million people living in poverty. You can't just continue growth for the sake of growth in a world in which we are struggling with climate change and all kinds of environmental problems. All right? You don't necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country. I don't think the media appreciates the kind of stress that ordinary Americans are working on. People scared to death about what happens tomorrow. Half the people in America have less than $10,000 in savings. How do you like that? That means you have an automobile accident, you have an illness, you're broke.

Look at the maps that people have to put together for Republican wins:  http://race42016.com/2015/04/02/what-will-the-2016-electoral-map-look-like/  Notice that every one of these maps requires the Republican to win Florida, Colorado and Virginia. On top of that, you have to add either Ohio, Iowa, New Mexico, and Nevada; or Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa; or Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. I think Michigan is the only state not on any of these lists that the Republicans have any shot at.  A Democrat who carries Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania is almost guaranteed to win in 2016. The Republican would need to win Virginia and Florida, and either Wisconsin or the entire Southwest (counting Colorado) in order to win.  Sanders would certainly be at a bit of a disadvantage, but I don't think it would be a landslide."

Most people don't know the history of the US flag. Although I've always known that the flag was a somewhat red neck symbol for people who couldn't let go of the past. The deeper you go down the rabbit hole the more you realize the flag is a racist symbol. Why don't they just fly the true confederate flag or their states succession flag? Why choose something that has specifically been used as a symbol of hatred? Boils down to tradition in their minds. I think it becomes hard to turn your back on something like that after so long. You saw your dad wave that flag and your granddaddy before him. And even though you know they have some backwards ideas you convinced yourself it's not all about that, but how to distance yourself from one aspect and not another? Hopefully we'll see pride in this flag diminish overtime just as racism continues to diminish. My grandfather was a racist and my father definitely is too, though he doesn't think it.

It really is a unique city and I will always cherish the Keep Austin Weird mentality but after coming up to the Dallas area for college I can't really see myself living anywhere else. I enjoy living and working around some of the northern suburbs like Carrollton, Richardson, & Garland, that are still all closely connected to Dallas itself. There is a great selection of apartments and houses to rent, and it's easy to move around the entire city thanks to the huge highways, so you don't have to live as close to your job. While Austin's economy and job prospects are often rated higher than Dallas, it's size can't help but give you more choices of where to live and work than Austin. As long as you can make yourself stand out in the (possibly larger) crowd of applicants for a position you want, you have many more options.

Because we all know, large young groups of people have a lot of resources and assets. Of course the large young population in Austin is bigger on a relative basis, but I doubt it is even bigger in real numbers compared to San Antonio, let alone Dallas. Just because everyone packs themselves into downtown Austin because it's the hipster place to be and there's a relatively speaking large University, does not make for higher quality or increased amenities. This is not a quantity over quality issue. The point I am making is precisely the opposite. There is way more to do in Dallas and even Houston for that matter, it's just not what the marginally self-sufficient 24-27 age group is circle-jerking itself about at this moment in time."

texas,3du13t,Nymaz,58,Sun Jul 19 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"In addition to the good suggestions here I'd recommend checking out and maybe asking in /r/Dallas   One of the things Europeans often don't ""get"" about America is the sheer size difference, and Texas is the prime example.  Texas is not only geographically big, but very culturally diverse region-to-region and even city-to-city.  So asking what to see and how to act in ""Texas"" is kind of like saying ""I'm coming to Europe, what should I see/how should I act?""  I hope you will have a car (or friends to cart you around).  Public transport is sorely lacking compared to Europe.  We do have a commuter bus/rail system in Dallas and the TRE connects Dallas and Fort Worth, but check the schedules and don't expect them to be available late into the night.  If you're looking for a ""western"" experience check the Stockyards area in Fort Worth.  There's various tours and events there.  Food wise, be sure to check out TexMex restaurants, but be warned, we like the food very spicy.  Don't try to fake tough it out, be honest with your server that you're a spice ""virgin"" and ask them for recommendations on mild.  Even if you're used to volcanic vindaloos, it's a different type of spicy than you're used to.  And speaking of servers, waiters/waitresses are  underpaid in America with the expectations of it being made up with tips.  Generally 15% of the total cost is expected, but feel free to go higher or lower for excellent or poor service.  Most other service personnel don't expect a tip (though car and hotel valets do).  And, by the way, welcome!"

(My daughter was a cheerleader at Hillcrest High School.)  Lincoln is an almost all black high school in South Dallas, where nearly everyone who's not on the football team is in the band. Terrell is about 45 minutes east southeast of Dallas, so it's kind of out in the country. Interesting to see the different cultures."

No good schools for it in Dallas, but tons of teams play in JerryWorld (the Cowboy's stadium, so-named for owner Jerry Jones). I'd try to make a weekend trip to a game in Austin (UT), College Station (Texas A&M), or, fuck it, Baton Rouge (Louisiana State). Nothing really compares to the atmosphere of a college campus on gameday, especially at big state schools. TCU is going to be really good and demolishing people in Ft. Worth as well, but they're a smaller, private school with 50,000 people at a game instead of 100,000. I just think a state school is the optimal way to get the full college football gameday experience.

Whataburger isn't good. It is fat, salty, greasy piles of cheesy awesomeness. Go late at night, after a dozen Shiner Bocks. Shiner Bock is one of the more popular local beers, try it.

I know Arlington by heart (but everyday I'm learning something New about her) and I have a decent amount of knowledge on Dallas and Ft. Worth.   Arlington: there's a lot to see and do around Arlington. Only problem is if You don't have a car, you're shit out of luck because Arlington is the largest city in the United States that doesn't have a legit public transport. Buuuut, other than that one of the first places I can point you to is the Parks Mall. Real cool places, lots of stores. Around the mall is an assortment of shops and restaurants. Downtown Arlington has a lot to offer as well, unfortunately for you, you're not 21, though you could visit bars. Just no alcohol for you ;P. There is also AT&T Stadium as well. That's where the Dallas Cowboys play, the Ranger's Stadium is a bit down the road from there.   Dallas: Dallas is really cool because it's an evolving city. There is lots of history to see in Dallas, of course anyone will tell you about President John F. Kennedy and Dealey Plaza first. Really cool to see, you can even go into the Book Depository to see the Snipers Nest, for a fee. Dallas is huge, but you're in luck because Dallas has D.A.R.T. which is their transportation system. You can get to almost everywhere around the city with it. Another well known area is Deep Ellum. Many bands play shows in that area. To me, the people are modern and really cool, but the area looks like it's stuck in the punk rock/old-school era. Its a sight to see.   Fort Worth: Stay away from anywhere south of Downtown. Actually just go to downtown. They have good food. Texmex, mostly. I don't really have much to say about Ft. Worth. But it's very industrial looking and it's not as active like Dallas or Arlington.

Because it seems to me that most people will have a similar ""it would mean so much to me because..."" story.

texas,3dpfwc,nyeus,4,Sun Jul 19 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"They're clean: only two or three colors, no text, not visually busy, big simple shapes rather than complicated little city seals or coats of arms. A common rule of thumb for whether a flag is simple enough is whether a schoolchild could accurately draw it from memory, and I think these two pass that easily.  I also like that they're well established in their cities. Lots of the flags I made replacements for were just a solid background with a stylish logo that looked like it couldn't be more than twenty years old. Corpus Christi's flag dates from 1952; I couldn't find when Laredo adopted their flag, but the design dates from 1840. And I bet a lot of cities' flags only have a couple copies made, maybe just one hanging up in the council chamber; these two, though, seem to be pretty well known in their cities."

texas,3dqt4m,ThatFatKidVince,3,Sat Jul 18 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on the individual school's policy. The law does allow Universities to govern where firearms are allowed on campus, as long as it doesn't directly undermine the ability of individuals to carry on campus overall. Very vague wording.  This law is is also not in effect until September of 2016.  http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB00011I.htm"
texas,3dqt4m,ThatFatKidVince,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:29 2015 UTC,Agreed on the vagueness.   If the schools do prohibit the storage of firearms in dorms it would be time consuming and difficult for students to retrieve them from their homes/local storage then return to class. Unless perhaps there was a weapon checkout station operated by officers located in the dormitories. I could see that working.

The fanatics and criminals are already carrying on campus.  This just empowers a 1% demographic that can now legally carry and shoot back.  As an aside, CHL holders in Texas are an extremely a tight-roped community. Behind on student loan or child support payments?   Revoked.  Mental health issue?  Revoked.  DWI?  That's a revoking.  Even slightly under the influence of a substance while carrying?  Oh you bet that's a revoking.  Get pulled over for speeding and don't whip out your CHL?  Revoked.  Miss your renewal date?  Revoked, and it's a pain to get re-instated.   Got an out-of-state CHL and don't comply with Texas CHL laws?  REVOKED.

texas,3dmsxe,JakeC1597,11,Fri Jul 17 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"His beliefs and mine about government are fundamentally different. I believe that ultimately the government is there to protect our rights and liberties, and to protect us from foreign threats, but not much more than that.    When it comes to the economy I think the government should stop companies from outright abusing people, but aside from that I believe that the economy should be run and regulated by the citizenry through their choice of showing whether or not a service or product is needed/wanted by purchasing those goods.    He, being a self-declared socialist, believes that the government should have much more of a hand in regulating day to day life, and that the economy should basically be an extension of the government.    I also believe in a traditional Republican form of government which is what we have now; representatives elected by the people to represent them in the government. Although I also believe that senators should be elected by state legislatures. The house was supposed to be representative of the people, and the Senate was to be representative of the state gov, but there was a law passed to change that a while back.    He would rather have a democratic socialist state in place.    Anyways, I had to greatly simplify some of those things for brevity, but if you have any questions or want me to clarify anything please ask."

The point is that he wants to spread his message to many parts of the country, including red states, and states that don't have early primaries. Probably, the point is also to get exposed to a few million potential small-dollar donors.  It doesn't matter if he can win Houston. If he can get a few more people excited, and maybe change a few minds, he can lay foundations for other campaigns in future years, for local Democrats and Socialists, as well as for statewide and federal candidates."

Get me?"
texas,3dmsxe,lawrnk,5,Fri Jul 17 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. His support of worker-owned enterprise emerges out of libertarian socialism. It's socialism in the fundamental sense of worker-ownership of the means of production, as opposed to the  authoritarian, Marxist-Leninist form of state socialism that over half a century of Cold War-era ideological warfare has burned into the minds of Americans as being the actual definition of socialism, when this is actually antithetical to the principles of left-wing market anarchists and libertarian socialists alike. I certainly agree that Americans' idea of what socialism actually is does not reflect reality."
texas,3dmsxe,FiscalCliffHuxtable,4,Fri Jul 17 19:50:05 2015 UTC,No doubt.  They call Obama a socialist and a communist in Texas.

You have to be retarded to think he's somehow the driving force behind all of this. How much power do they think the presidency even has?

I don't think they are arguing for slavery or racism or anything else people on this thread to seem to think.    Really?  Waving the Confederate Battle Flag at an African American and you're just going to be like ""no racism here, durr""?   and think the idea of banning any form of speech is wrong , I love being a Texan for how outspoken (sometimes too much so ) we are for our freedoms so much so as we will literally wave the symbol someone is attempting to ban right in their face .   Nobody has banned anything. Some stores stopped selling them during the aftermath of another horrific race fueled mass killing. Some people said maybe we should stop celebrating this traditional symbol of hate and racism. And some government institutions stopped flying a literally seditious symbol."
texas,3dm67j,dragon_tornado69,0,Fri Jul 17 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"Ouch thanks for the burn . I agree with some of your points here, my fear is the scare tactic used in all government when one major event happens to roll forwards with limitations on rights . I completely agree with the notion that we shouldn't have governments sponsoring that flag and I agree 100% with the idea it should never be flown at any govt site. It was an enemy country and lost , we don't raise Third Reichs flags. The way I read this article was that these people were giving a big middle finger to the president similar to throwing a tomato at him ,  doing this in order to argue for freedom of speech , that is what I agree with . Just because a group of people look at this flag in a certain way doesn't mean everyone does . Here on the state border of Texas and Louisiana they took down the battle flag (this one) and raised the confederate state flag in its place. The difference over those two flags is incredible and no one cares bc they don't recognize the actual confederate state flag . If you ask me the CSF represents more hatred bc all it represents is the state of confederacy a independent enemy nation fighting against the right of a certain group of people , whereas the battle flag has evolved over time and gained a cultural identity with the south. Representing state pride , seen in music such as Lynard skynard ,in TV shows with the Dukes of hazard , and in countless other media forms . I could go on but your just going to rip me a new one either way bc I am a ""southern bigot and a racist retard "". I don't own a confederate flag and would never fly one , I am a native Texan but my family was in Ireland during slavery and the civil war , but I think if someone has a cultural identity with it they should be allowed to ."
texas,3dm67j,0sigma,3,Fri Jul 17 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a Texan, and you seem like a nice person. Definitely not a ""southern bigot and a racist retard"".  I also fear the rollback of citizen rights, and if that starts to happen in this case I'll be right there with you condemning it.   Now here is where I think you and I differ.    ""doing this in order to argue for freedom of speech""   I don't believe it. They have free speech already. These people have a right to do what they are doing, free from governmental persecution. That is where their rights end.  They do not have any right to be free from public scrutiny, which is what you are trying to do by wrapping it in a false veil of a free speech issue. Let their message stand on its own, and criticize it accordingly."
texas,3dm67j,NecessitoWhizar,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:44 2015 UTC,I don't get the free speech part. How is speech being abridged?
texas,3dm67j,dragon_tornado69,0,Fri Jul 17 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"Right now , your correct no free speech has been abridged , but look at Germany no nazi symbolism is allowed . Do I think everyone in Germany should be waiving third reich flags absolutely not , do I think the go enemy had the power to ban it , absolutely not . Rights are a slippery slope right now they are rising it off give buildings and companies refuse to sell it . Dukes of hazard is off the air and lots of radio stations stopped playing sweet home Alabama . We have essentially created censorship over a old flag due to one action and if the font takes advantage it could ride that slippery slope and affect a lot of other symbols as well"
texas,3dm67j,NecessitoWhizar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a bunch of overstatement and I completely disagree. I don't know, maybe see Dixie Chicks. Everything is a slippery slope, especially according to anyone opposed. If you're bothered by slippery slopes, maybe look into the slopes of anti-abortion, middle east wars or radically expanding gun rights. Epic slopes. All political agendas have arc or slope and it's not inherently bad. I wish it wasn't necessary but   I'm glad women's rights didn't stop at suffrage and continues to this day. OTOH, MADD lost credibility when they appeared to go down a slope toward prohibition. Overreach is the problem. I don't see overreach from the anti-flaggers here, I see pent up tension getting long overdue resolution. And in-your-face neo-confederate diehards. Don't get me wrong, not putting you in that camp. But I see a lot of talk about individual rights, ""we the people's"" rights not so much.  Edit: Some of the Republicans in the South Carolina state house set the right example. If they can come to terms with the Confederate flag as they have, well... there's no excuse not to. Yeah, there's probably a politically correct component, but progress is the take-away."
texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"No one is being dis-allowed from buying or displaying the Confederate flag. However, people are certainly free to choose not to sell something. That is also a form of freedom of speech (and also, just the freedom to conduct your business as you see fit.)  Government is only involved in that they have stopped displaying the flag of another nation that treasonously declared war on the United States in an official capacity. That is not a freedom of speech issue. The government has not even suggested preventing any kind of speech here. Everyone is still just as free as they ever were to display whatever flag they like."
texas,3dm67j,easwaran,8,Sat Jul 18 03:20:41 2015 UTC,No one is trying to ban this flag. They're just trying to get state and local governments to stop sponsoring it. They're also hoping that other people will recognize how hateful the flag often seems (especially in certain contexts) and will voluntarily choose to stop using it in places like this. But no one is proposing banning it.
texas,3dm67j,dragon_tornado69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly , and I agree with the govt not allowing its use in public buildings paid for by tax dollars and like I said above I am not related to any confederates I don't have a flag and will never fly one but I think there is another side to this flag that a lot of people identify with that is complicated but does not stand for the racism and hatred that most people associate it with"
texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a question: what does it mean for a thing to symbolize or represent something? That is, if I personally think that a symbol represents something to me does that make it the case? If I fly a swastika and say, ""no no, it's totally just a Hindu thing"" will you agree that it isn't a racist, hateful symbol? If I have a burning cross decal on my car and say that it's ""history, not hate"" would that really fly?  I would say it's true that a lot of people misunderstand the symbol. After all, even its designer declared that it was a symbol of the ""white man's superiority over the inferior colored race."" So anyone who claims it is anything but a symbol of racism, slavery, and hatred is wrong."
texas,3dm67j,ruinerofexplanations,-4,Sat Jul 18 03:26:24 2015 UTC,I've seen tons of people that want it banned. Just a quick google search shows that.
texas,3dm67j,easwaran,7,Fri Jul 17 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"I guess it's true - you'll find plenty of people in any country or group who want to ban all sorts of things. What I should have said is that I'm fairly sure that no politicians, major media personalities, organized interest groups, or political campaigns have issued a call for a ban on the Confederate flag. The organized calls have all been for removal from government property."
texas,3dm67j,Old_Army90,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:08 2015 UTC,I've seen tons of people that want it banned   Which are usually private citizens.

I've yet to hear any politician imply that they would like to prosecute or fine any individual flying it on their own private property.

texas,3dm67j,ttufizzo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else getting tired of this argument and the circlejerking it brings?  The flag a symbol, like any other flag or emblem. Its meaning changes from time to time and place to place and person to person. To some people the flag is a symbol of racism. To others it might be a symbol of the Southeastern region of the US. In the past, it was even stood for the Army of Northern Virginia.   Can we all just agree to disagree and move on to important things?"
texas,3dm67j,sonorousAssailant,3,Fri Jul 17 17:55:37 2015 UTC,Any symbol that has frequently been used as a symbol by a large group of people to help subjugate another large group of people is not an unimportant thing.
texas,3dm67j,ttufizzo,3,Fri Jul 17 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"You can say the exact same thing about numerous other flags, including the United States flag.  It's a flag. It's a piece of cloth. Get over it."
texas,3dm67j,NecessitoWhizar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"The flag of the Army of Northern Virginia is not the flag of any current political entity. This is an important distinction between that flag and others that may have flown over people doing bad things. While there are some that simply use it to refer to regionalism, it is something that is used by many others to intimidate a large group of people.   The fact that it reminds large groups of people of lynchings and other forms of intimidation against them just because of the color of their skin or their religion should be reason enough for it not to be used by any governmental body as any sort of official emblem when it does not represent any actual political entity and never actually did.   If they like the heritage of the CSA, they need to at least use an official CSA flag, preferably the original one that has not been used by many white supremacist groups.  The flags of Rhodesia and Apartheid era South Africa are not just flags subject to interpretation, they are used in most instances to represent white supremacy. They are not just pieces of cloth in the same way that the Nazi Swastika is not just a design."
texas,3dm67j,Jakegraham94,0,Fri Jul 17 22:23:58 2015 UTC,Sorry dude. Current events. Maybe talk to the folks waving flags?
texas,3dm67j,ernsttinaja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:49 2015 UTC,The flag is no longer a sign of slavery to many people. The past few months have made the flag a symbol of free speech. That is simply all they are doing here. The fact that our president is black means nothing. Since the removal of the flag from the government building it is being removed in a lot of places even history books. This just feels wrong. Sure take it down from the government buildings but it shouldn't have to go any further than that.

But when a clear majority of people see a symbol in a similar way and you're flying that symbol, you're going to get criticism or publicity.  Prior to the KKK, a burning cross was a symbol of religious fervor. In Scotland they used it as a call to war. Despite that, nobody in their right might who genuinely associated a burning cross with one of those descriptions would put one up in their yard for everyone to see. Regardless of your intentions, you're going to be seen as a KKK sympathizer.  This is what you should expect when you wave a Confederate flag around. People are going to associate that with racism, whether you actually associate it with racism or not. You can't hold anyone at fault for thinking that, aside maybe yourself for actually thinking you won't be criticized or talked about in a negative way."
texas,3dm67j,Tex_dad,11,Fri Jul 17 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"See, here's the issue: I was ALSO born and raised in Texas (in a tiny farm town), and have ALSO been here all my life, and I see the ""confederate flag"" (yes, I know it's the ANV battle flag with wrong proportions) as a symbol of racism and the bullshit ideology of the ""noble lost cause."" Maybe it's cause I'm from north Texas and not east Texas, but I don't give a shit about southern heritage, and don't see myself as ""a southerner."" I see the Confederacy as a historical error that deserved to be blotted out, and I'm embarrassed that Texas was part of it. I think whatever flaws he had Sam Houston is a hero for resisting it. While I think it has a place in museums, I think government entites flying the flag is a travesty, an endorsement and constant reminder of the horrendously immoral system that afflicted our country for nearly nine decades, and I think people pretending it's not a symbol of racism are fooling themselves.  Now, whose opinion is more valid, mine or yours? Which represents 'real' Texans? The answer to both questions of course is ""neither."" But the issue's not as simple as saying ""oh, real Texans don't see it that way so it doesn't count."""

texas,3dm67j,DreadLordNate,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that those folks who went to Oklahoma make us all look bad.  I can't agree with you on the logic that the confederate flag is no longer a symbol of racism based on the logic that no one currently alive was around during slavery times. I don't believe that logic holds up, because the flag doesn't exist I a vacuum.   The confederate flag was used heavily by people during the civil rights era who had a vested interest in keeping black Americans as second class citizens. It was used by people who blew up churches and killed little girls. By people who lynched young black men for looking at women, took picture and kept bits of rope as souvineers. By people who killed people for having the audacity to try to register to vote or ride a bus or go to school. This was 50 years ago. There are lots of folks around today that were alive in that time.   We can't willfully forget that these are things that happened because they make us feel uncomfortable. These things happened. Unconscionable acts were done by people waiving that flag around. This isn't a heritage to be proud of."

texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"If you paid as much attention to school as you do here, you'd find out the Civil War was over states rights. The military fought each because they had to because the Democrats didn't want to lose money."
texas,3dm67j,benholioo,2,Sat Jul 18 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"Every single declaration of war made by each of the confederate states individually and the confederacy as a whole make it explicitly clear that the primary issue was slavery. The thing you believe about the war is simply false and the entire consensus of professional historians disagrees with you. It's understandable why you have these false beliefs, because there is a large contingency that spreads a lot of false information. But the truth is both easily available and perfectly clear.    Here are the declarations of war. http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ Just do a control-F for slave. Now try it for 'state's rights.' The only 'state right' that was at issue was the 'right' to own humans."
texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,0,Sat Jul 18 05:19:10 2015 UTC,The flag shows what it describes. Your feelings on it are yours. I choose to see things as they are not how you or some guy from the past want them to be.  You are false for focusing on a single aspect of the causes of war.
texas,3dm67j,benholioo,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"Read the words of the people who decided to start the war. They say very clearly why they did it. Really, it's not a lot of reading and it's really enlightening. You made the claim that a lack of proper education was at fault. So, challenge that belief of yours. Read the actual historical documents. It is unambiguous. They refer to the union as the ""anti-slavery states."" ""States' rights"" is a modern, revisionist construction.  The horrors of the historical south are not a reflection on you today. How could they be? You weren't there. Why do you feel compelled to defend these people? If you were to meet them in person, you would be horrified. Because they were unashamed about their beliefs that the white race was completely just in owning black slaves. And they were so zealous about this belief that they committed treason against the US and started a war that killed more than half a million people. There is nothing honorable about any of that.   If you personally want to invent a different history and a different interpretation of the symbols of history, then at the very least don't be surprised when everyone else disagrees with the fantasy world you've constructed in your mind.

You are changing the subject to suit your line of reasoning. The war was about economics. It's always about money and power over other people to make that money.
texas,3dm67j,benholioo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:44 2015 UTC,"It was about the economics of owning people, yes. The confederacy was unwilling to give up all the economic benefit they gained from treating humans like property. How do I know this? Because they said it explicitly.   It was about power over other people, yes. It was about the confederacy believing they should have the power to own people.   You said the war was about states rights, and I said you were wrong and cited the declaration of war itself as evidence. You said what the flag represents and I said you were wrong and cited the designer of the flag and the nation that the flag flew over as evidence. I haven't changed the subject a lick."
texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Those are the sanest statements I read from you.  Not one mention of slavery.  Slavery is a matter of owning people for economic reasons not to just own people. You are looking for reasons for issues that have already come and past.  Those issues don't apply to a symbol. The connections you make, while correct, is not the end of the issue.  I'm not debating history. I'm debating your ability to comprehend it because you are repeating it."
texas,3dm67j,benholioo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"You don't get to just say a symbol means whatever you would like it to. It's like language, it's a shared and social object. If you run around trying to say that the n-word means only something affectionate when you use it, people are going to react very poorly to that. Similarly, the flag of treasonous slave owners isn't going to be super popular with people who think starting a war with the US is a good way to define your heritage. Your claim that this flag represents anything like liberty is still completely absurd.   And, uh, I mentioned slavery in like 2/3rds of that comment. 'Owning people' is what slavery is. Oooooobviously they wanted slaves for economic reasons. Why does that matter? They wanted to own people and they were willing to kill fantastically more Americans that Al Qaeda and Isis ever will to do so. That makes them dicks and any of their symbols are symbols of giant assholes."
texas,3dm67j,WallyMetropolis,0,Sat Jul 18 22:52:11 2015 UTC,The war didn't even get slaves free. Martin Luther King Jr had to point that out. Your liberal historians need to do more research.

I'm staying right on the topics that you are choosing.   Here is what cannot be denied. The flag of a nation represents that nation. This is the flag of a nation that treasonously declared a war on the US that led to just about as many US war casualties than all other conflicts combined. It is the flag of a nation that was founded on defending the right to own humans. Anyone who makes any claims at all about personal liberties should find that flag to be a repugnant symbol of exactly the opposite of that principle."

You are adding things like descriptions of the Civil War as distractions to fill space and make yourself look smart.  I get it, but if you can't comprehend simple sentences we are just going to go in circles here.  To label something as undeniable, is to prevent people from digging into it on a deeper level.

texas,3dmlpe,dam072000,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what could be done. Education (for the youth) is probably the biggest driving factor who 'getting out', but Hispanic culture being so family driven, people often stay to help with the family or care for their elderly who live in the same residence.   From what I've seen and been told from my parents (whom are both home health nurses) is that it's a bit of lack of education and opportunity to grow (financially) to better their lives.   So many of the areas that are settled for colonias are agriculturally worthless and thus very cheap to settle on. It goes along side with the low wage jobs that Hispanics often get (I don't mean that in saying that it's actively pursued).  Helping these areas is tricky. The unemployment rate in some colonias is more than eight times the state rate. A 1993 Texas A&M study discovered that unemployment in five Lower Rio Grande Valley colonias ranged from 20 percent to 60 percent, compared with the overall Texas unemployment rate of 7 percent. In addition, many colonia residents often cannot find year-round work due to the seasonal nature of their primary occupations. Fieldwork represents 29.5 percent of their jobs, construction work, 24.4 percent, and factory work, 14.9 percent."

And I understand the situation well enough to know that people in power aren't looking to improve it, but rather look for an excuse to blame poor people for being poor. That way they can dismiss the situation as the inevitable result of those lazy mexicans and do nothing about it.   If you improve conditions in the current colonias will others pop-up because you didn't address the cause for them to pop-up?   The cause is poverty. And since we'll never be rid of that, may as well not pave the streets, or put in adequate drainage or plumbing. Those poors will just put up their hovels anywhere. Better to keep them contained.

I just googled the Sherriff's name and a 7 year old story about him being fired for allegations of racism was the first thing to return.

texas,3dj3xr,regent040,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"I think he won the election for Sheriff because of what happened in Hempstead and not in spite of it. Waller county has had racial problems for years. A lot of the problems stem from the fact that Prairie View A&M, which is a historically black college, is located in the county and the white population doesn't want to allow the students to vote.  They also don't want the students to drive through town, eat at the local restaurants, shop at the local businesses, or really even leave the campus grounds. This sheriff's firing garnered a lot of media attention at the time it happened and Hempstead is actually in Waller county so the electorate undoubtedly knew about it. The fact that ""community organizers"" from Houston came to Hempstead and accused him of being racist and violent toward African Americans who were in custody only increased his popularity in that county. It wasn't like he had a moment of clarity and realized he had wronged those people of color in the past and vowed to turn over a new leaf.  If they wanted someone like that they could've just voted for his African American Democratic opponent in the election.  No, they knew who he was and what he told for. He was one of them and that's why they voted for him.  They expected him to bring the things that got him fired from Hempstead to the county level."

I would like more information before I lay out judgement on this particular case. If it is shown that the cops caused her death, or unjustifiably arrested her, then I would suggest the maximum penalty for all of them involved. However, many times the story is not as clear cut as the media makes it seem. It is quite possible that she was being highly disrespectful and possibly even forced their hand by refusing to comply. She was pulled over for a legal reason (I have gotten a ticket for not signalling before), and if she refused to show license or insurance then the cops have a duty to bring her in... Once again, we need more details before we can judge...  Long story short; Unless you meet a psychopathic cop (which do exists, but no more in Texas than anywhere else), as long as you are polite and cooperative, you should be fine."

texas,3dixib,sunscooter,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"Back in the late '80s, I worked for one shift as a night stocker for a Kroger's. I was specifically instructed to shove the current stock to the back and place new stock in front of it. It hurt my brain to even consider improperly fronting the shelves so once my supervisors left me alone, I went back to properly fronting the stock. I couldn't believe how much pressure I was put under for $4.25/hr. I didn't come back for a second shift. My one paycheck paid for my first CD Walkman, approximately $30 plus tax."

I guess they were trying to make sure only desperate people stuck around."

So they only build stores that can be serviced by truck drivers who are within a 3-4 hour radius of the distribution center so they can drive to the store, unload, and get back home by the end of the work day.  Expanding beyond their current area will not just be a matter of adding new stores.  They have to build a new distribution center and then a network of stores that will all open at nearly the same time."

texas,3dixib,TxMedic436,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:12 2015 UTC,Yes they do.  Those are probably run as a separate company.  They have quite a few stores along the border on the US side but I expect the Mexico stores are stocked out of a Mexican distribution center.

texas,3dixib,OtulGib,3,Thu Jul 16 19:54:18 2015 UTC,I gave away $500 worth of items once because the woman found so many expired items on the shelves   This makes me wonder if the lady brought in unused products from her kitchen and just claimed they were on the shelves.
texas,3dixib,hodyoaten,4,Thu Jul 16 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Worked at heb 5 years. We had shrink champions at the door to monitor stuff like this and deter shop lifters etc.   No, the people OP is talking about are real. Mostly older people with nothing better to do and plenty of time. There was one lady infamous for it in my store. She'd roll in around 4 or 5 in the afternoon and at about 9 pm she'd be coming down the line. 2 carts, one expired, one with the in-date replacement. It would take a fucking hour to check her out (we'd open a register specifically for her when we saw her) because the process is scan the item, then price change to 0, which needs manager approval EVERY time. And also it's our responsibility as the worker to check the date ourselves and make sure she's not pulling a fast one so that takes time as well. Hated her, but don't hold it against her, she got (and probably still does) thousands of dollars of free food.   The policy is meant for if you buy an out of date product on accident they'll replace it no problem, not for people to go trolling the shelf and basically doing the stockers job for them. They don't WANT you to take advantage of the policy like OP is making it seem. Costs them money and cuts into profits, but obviously they have to have the policy in place. There's a reason so few people know it exists."
texas,3dixib,Icherus,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"How much money does it cost? I was under impression that the food after the date is thrown away. Thus, it seems that a person pays for the item that has a good date and takes the item that has a bad date for free. Therefore, how is it different from a situation where a person pays for an item and store throws the other item away?  Are you talking about profits on selling food past the date to unsuspecting customers? That is the unexpected margin on food that is trashed otherwise?"
texas,3dixib,texasguy911,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I must not have clarified correctly in my post. If you find an out of date item, they will give you an in-date for free. Meaning you don't pay at all. It's like returning (getting your money back) the item then getting a free replacement anyway.  Yes, the out of date is thrown away, but the in date is given away for free. It's nothing but throwing money away from the company standpoint   Edit: HEB cannot knowingly sell out of date food or give it to a customer. Same reason so much meat and produce gets throw in the trash instead of given to homeless shelters, they can't risk the lawsuit. ""HEB knew this product was out of date and they gave it to me anyway! Now I have gential herpes! Pay me money!""   So by bringing an out of date product to the attention of workers they confiscate and trash it, and give you your money back AND give you a replacement product."

Shit they could use the one that runs with 290 to test the waters, and build up from there.   Unfortunately it will never happen. The greater Houston area will continue to expand to fuckin mega city 1 and 99% of everyone will still drive their cars and commute because no one in charge wants to take on a project this size."

Though some of the congressional representatives are voting for anti-pork banning the expenditure of federal money for rail in Houston, thus preventing rail from reaching Uptown.  So it's not true that ""no one in charge wants to take on a project this size"" - it's just that these projects are slow. Look at Los Angeles - it's turning around, but it's very slow to turn a city that big."

texas,3dgw7b,Muun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"It might be worth looking up that same trip under the new bus system. I don't know if you had a direct bus line before, or had a connection, or what, but the region from a bit north of downtown to UH should have better bus service as a result of this redesign (though the biggest benefits probably come a bit west of downtown).  It's not likely to be anywhere near as fast as driving, but depending on where exactly you're going, it can often save a lot of time, money, and hassle with parking."

texas,3dgw7b,hipst,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:40 2015 UTC,"Its an infraction for a good reason, its super unsafe. Drivers aren't anticipating someone hauling ass between lanes, if they decided to switch lanes, you may ram right into them, or they you. In situations like this when it's standstill it's obviously less of a risk, but when traffic is moving slowly, you can bet your ass drivers are going to try to switch lanes."

Apparently, recent studies have shown that lane-splitting actually reduces fatal injuries.  http://americanmotorcyclist.com/rights/positionstatements/lanesplitting.aspx  Obviously, you can't go much faster than the vehicles to either side if you want to travel safely, but that still increases the efficiency of the roadway, if there are more people per square foot of road space."

texas,3dgw7b,raptorfromspace,0,Thu Jul 16 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"You're displaying ignorance.  Are you even a motorcyclist?  The motorcyclist has to be cognizant of their surroundings as part of their operation.  Cars give signs of the path that they are to take, and motorcyclists are aware of these cues.  When cars are in traffic, they are limited in the direction of travel and the speed with which they can change their path.  Motorcyclists are well aware of these limits and exploit them to their advantage.  The one thing a motorcyclist cannot control for is an idiot in a car who can't or doesn't stop while a motorcyclist is waiting behind another car...  Unless that motorcyclist is NOT stopped waiting behind another car."
texas,3dgw7b,hipst,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"No, I was an EMT and dealt with a lot of motorcyclist accidents.  What I'm talking about is traffic moving at a decent or slow pace, a car jumping into the next lane, and not realizing or expecting there's a motorcycle barreling between cars. After working enough accidents from lane splitting, I'm not keen on opening up the can of worms. For every good driver there's a bad one, same goes for motorcyclists."
texas,3dgw7b,raptorfromspace,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"As a former EMT, I'm sure you'd love to see motorcycles banned then, too?  Everything in life has hazard, lane splitting reduces the risk of a significant hazard for a motorcyclist.  The accidents that you saw, how many of them were severe specifically due to a motorcyclist not wearing a helmet and proper clothing?  Evaluate and compare.  Cars cannot ""jump"".  The last I checked, cars do not have legs. Cars can only change lanes quickly without a noticeable turn of the front wheels at significant (20+) speed. At lower speeds, cars can ""nose in"".  Cars can turn their wheels in a particular direction.  These are cues that a motorcyclist observes.  Your euphemism of a car ""jump""ing is alarmist and is intended to steer the reader's emotions in your favor.  If everything that was dangerous was banned because the debate was steered by EMT who had lots of stories about smart people doing stupid things, no one would leave the house and civilization would collapse."

If you want a investigation fine, but don't argue that it is because of this video when the unedited footage clearly shows that they were discussing tissue donations.   And for the record, in Texas Planned Parenthood is audited every ... single .... year. If PP were doing anything illegal in the state of Texas it would have already been caught. Abbott knows this, he's just doing this investigation to pander to voters."
texas,3digof,OtulGib,0,Thu Jul 16 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"I don't base it on the video, but the attitude of that PP senior executive is very disturbing - even PP had to apologize for it.  I just don't trust PP.  For instance they are hypocritical about ultrasounds - they fight ultrasound legislation at every turn but this video proves they heavily rely on them to harvest body parts.  That doesn't add up.  Regarding the auditing, when I googled it, all I could find where reports of PP fraud - one example - uncovered by audits.  That made me trust them even less.  It seems these audits are only financial in nature, and I presume a financial audit is very different than a targeted criminal investigation, and therefore Abbot's motives on that front are not duplicitous.  I'm not saying that he's not looking for any reason to minimize PP and win political points.  He probably is - just don't use the audits as evidence of opportunism."
texas,3digof,MEGABITE1,4,Fri Jul 17 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"Ok. You have no idea what you're talking about. This is a fantastic example of people taking partial information and making blanket assumptions based on small pieces of information they think they understand about the topic of abortion.   You have to get an ultrasound when you get an abortion. It has to be done to confirm that you're pregnant and that the pregnancy isn't ectopic. What PP fought were mandatory ultrasounds that forced doctors to spend time telling women what they see in regards to the fetus while making women watch the monitor. PP doesn't fight using ultrasounds. They use them all the time.   Whats more about that if you get an abortion and want to donate organs from it you're having a later term abortion because 1st trimester organs aren't fully formed until sometime in the 2nd trimester. Organs partially form in the first trimester. For example the heart cells start beating at around 6 weeks, but the heart itself doesn't fully form all the components (chambers, etc.) until much later. Things like the lungs don't start to fully form until the 21st week. This means that the overwhelming majority of them (and 100% of them that take place after 24 weeks or 20 in Texas's case) are abortions due to medical issues in the pregnancy. These are called D&C's and are also dubbed ""partial birth"" abortions by pro-life groups.   These abortions which are done because of medical reasons have a host of ultrasound images that have been taken of them. For one thing the anatomy scan at 20 weeks is the first ultra sound you get done to make sure the fetus is developing properly physically. If you're getting an abortion this late ultrasounds are the reason why something wrong was detected and anyone giving you a D&C is going to rely heavily on ultrasounds to preform the procedure. PP (or any other abortion provider) using the ultrasound to make sure certain organs aren't crushed during the procedure because the woman wants to donate the tissues to medical research isn't them being hypocritical.   What the ultrasound bills do that PP (and all the other medical associations in the US) fought force doctors to take that ultrasound, point the monitor at the women, and describe what they're seeing. This is especially invasive and hurtful for women who are having the procedure because of a medical reason. Many of these women have already seen multiple ultrasounds and have had the deformity/anomaly/failure described to them countless times. They don't need to go through it again. Women who are getting an abortion of choice don't need a condicending ultrasound introduction as though it will dissuade them from making a choice that they've already decided. You clearly don't understand the role an ultrasound plays in an abortion or what ultrasound legislation actually does. You're making assumptions of what the specifics are based on very little information.   As for the link to the ""fraud"" Texas found ..... that wasn't fraud and it wasn't found by Texas audits. It was a claim made by a woman by the name of Abby Johnson who is a pro-life worker that has made a career off of making claims about PP. She used to work for PP and quit before she was about to be fired because PP found out she was taking patient information. After she was fired she began working for pro-life groups making claims about PP, none of which have ever stuck.   http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/convert/page/0/1  http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/flashback-abby-johnson%E2%80%99s-suspicious-conversion-anti-choice-movement  What you linked me clearly states that it was a claim. PP settled and paid a little over a million over the claim because the organization couldn't afford to get drawn into legal battles over it. Instead they settled and closed a PP location in Texas.   http://www.texasobserver.org/planned-parenthood-affiliate-to-pay-a-1-4m-medicaid-fraud-settlement/  Greg Abbott vowed to investigate them, but never actually found any wrong doing. That is what these claims are designed to do. They're designed to hurt the political image of PP. Later investigations have never turned up evidence of wrong doing. PP has never been prosecuted for breaking legal, medical, or financial laws but by the time investigations show that the news story is over. People don't stick around to see if the facts pan out. They just watch the initial story and move on which is exactly what is happening with this video.   And by the way yes, the audits in Texas are financial in nature. They're done in order to make sure PP isn't using women's health funding for abortions. Your claim that information about PP profiting off organ sales wouldn't show up in a financial audit is a joke. That is the very place something like that would be found.   Also, a medical director talking to (what she thinks is a medical research facility) candidly about organ donations isn't disturbing. That is what people in the medical field do. Organ donations are gross. That's just a reality, but the very people who work with them every day aren't phased by it anymore. There wasn't anything disturbing about the footage at all and if you'd watch the unedited footage you could see that she was actually being quite sincere with the conversation."
texas,3digof,stillhousebrewco,0,Fri Jul 17 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"I do know how PP tries to nuance the difference between why they take ultrasounds and why they think enforcement of them is wrong.  I disagree with PP on the principal that patients should have informed consent, but I also don't think it should be repeated if the woman has already seen one.  My basic principal is that abortion is probably the most controversial issue in the US and there should be an investigation to prove/disprove serious allegations about any business conducting abortions - especially large for-profit corporations.  Other than personal identities, abortion and anything related to it, should the most open process possible and anything to tarnish it should be closely examined to the fullest extent - not settled and swept under the rug leaving doubts in everyone's mind.  In this particular case, the government should at least verify PP's statement.  Don't you want to hear an official saying ""we've reviewed body part donations; all were certifiably voluntary; and none were for-profit""?  Or even a statement saying ""here's how donations are tracked and certified; everyone is welcome to review the process and to verify for themselves each transaction""?  In fact I would expect PP to explain donations on their own website, but I couldn't find it.  This type of hidden process causes people to question their agenda, and I think that needs to be dispelled.  You're basically telling me that there's already been enough healthy skepticism of PP; that investigations are not necessary; and that the current oversight system works, but I don't agree.  If that were the case, we would not have so many stories about PP and its methods/agenda.  This business, more than any other, has to be beyond reproach, and I don't think we're there yet."
texas,3digof,maowsers93,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"Planned parenthood is a nonprofit organization. You don't even understand the basics of the topic. I said that an investigation can be done if you like but don't blame it on an overly edited video when the unedited footage clearly shows that they were talking about donations. Medical research donations is a basic right of every patient at every medical facility in the US. Specifics about that information isn't available on most medical clinic web sites because it is a personal situation that's discussed with the patients. If you think PP isn't being transparent because it isn't on their site then you're going to have to extend that thinking to every other health care provider who doesnt.   The reason accusations are lobbed against PP constantly is because pro life groups are constantly trying to get the organization closed. Pro life groups who've been showed over and over again to be passing off false info shouldn't be taken seriously as reputable sources.   You want more investigations?  Fine, but know that investigations have been done for decades because of baseless claims from pro life groups and not ...a .... single .... charge has stuck against PP nor has the organization ever been found to have been doing illegal activity.   You've clearly made up your mind about PP and no amount of information, links, or proof that past claims have always been shown to be baseless will change your mind. That's fine, but don't expect the rest of tax payers to jump for joy when more public money is being spent to investigate a NON PROFIT organization that's already been turned inside out looking for fault.   Edit: and for the record PP establishes consent before every abortion during an inpatient councilling session before the procedure. You've zero understanding of what you're talking about. You've clearly made up your mind about PP and what happens during an abortion with zero information about either subject. You keep lobbing out half cocked theories about abortions and PP with zero factual basis and they are all incorrect.   Yes this subject is controversial. That's why it is so important for people to understand the facts that surround it and not make up nice sounding theories not based on information like you clearly have."
texas,3digof,maowsers93,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"sorry - incorrectly had PP as for-profit.  was looking at their IS and thinking it was for-profit.  having said that, non-profit doesn't mean altruistic either.  agree - all medical organizations should be transparent on providing and receiving donations.  that was my implication.  regarding consent - was referring to the body part donations.  I know that consent for abortions is given, but I don't know how well the body part consent is regulated/tracked/enforced.  regarding your claim that no charges have ever stuck against PP - don't have the time to verify that but the settlement you mentioned is evidence (IMO) that they had costly risk exposure to head off, i.e. they had something to cover up.  (Aside: trying to research PP is a real slog - so many opinion sites to work through.  that's why I quit trying to verify your claim.)  What I was searching for on the PP site was any information about how PP donates body parts.  IMO they should publish that, and if they had, there wouldn't be a need for a PP official to even have discussions like the one videotaped.  Even if it's legit, it still comes off shady.  I've not clearly made up my mind about PP - rather I'm suspicious of them.  And I think everything about this industry should be completely transparent and regulated so that we can reduce public suspicion on individual companies and focus on the core issues of abortion.  That's what really dividing everyone.  The companies should be secondary - but we're not going to get there with the current system."

Cause guess what; even if you get rid of the dealers, almost all the jobs will still exist. Used car sales, warranty service and regular service are where the margins are. New car sales only keep the lights on.   A manufacturer could easily open a showroom and contract out the remainder of the work to a business owner."

It won't happen over night but it will happen. Car dealerships are owned by people with families, employing people funding their families. they were started with a certain barrier to entry that helps protect the large investment they made and if the gov tears down this barrier they will be crushed by massive corporations. People forget about the little guy, and though it's hard to believe in this fight the car dealerships are the little guy being protected by a door that's locked by blue laws with monsters on the lawn named ford, gm ect.

They need rich people to give them money (10% of their budget) in the same way they need professors to land grants and contracts (46% of budget) instead of teaching classes.   In this scenario, a kid from a rich family is as valuable as a 5 star HS QB for potential revenue to the university.  That HS QB is not going to need a 90th percentile SAT, and neither is the rich kid.  Out of >7000 freshmen each year, they are going to take a monetary gamble on ~150.  I bet on average they get more donated money back from those 150 than the rest of the 7000.  I'm not saying this is right, I saying this is the reality.

They take it for granted as if as a freshman or sophomore they were go by to be handed a degree no matter what they did. Also after those type of people graduate it only gets worse. These type of people have no respect for people who payed their own way or had to take out crippling student loans. One of the first things my father taught me from a early age was that even though my personal education was being payed for but to respect all my fellow Longhorns no matter if they had loans to pay for school or are getting a free ride from their family. This has carried over to the business that he and I both are in and that from Janitor to CEO everyone deserves the most value and respect as others.

Change will have come and gone by the time my fears come true-- but not the type you wanted. I see past his facade of humility. It'll be sudden. It'll be a blitzkrieg of government intrusion. It'll start with a natural disaster-- something like a hurricane, an arctic blast, or a heat wave in New York.   Then they'll come: Jet black helicopters with the odd one here and there bearing the seal of the presidency. They'll round everyone up and place them in FEMA camps, beating women and children--especially the white ones--until they submit to the welfare state. We'll try to fight, but it'll be too little, too late. Soldiers won't be the ones to do this since they--the true patriots they are--will fight till the last drop of american blood is spilled with the full might of the 2nd amendment on their side. It'll be ObamaNation 2000 Robots-- the latest model, not the shitty ones you can get at the toy store. They'll round us up and place us in the worst conditions humanity has ever seen. They'll be FEMA camps with limited space; cold, fluoridated water; and only basic cable. After they've rounded the sheeple up, the real nightmare will begin.   The CDC government shills will begin asking if anyone is ""injured,"" with something as simple as the Flu being cause enough for bringing you into the ""clinic,"" and they'll begin injecting you with all sorts of noxious chemicals; syringes oozing with the grotesque, foamy remnants of autistic children. Abortions will be standard procedure for women as they implement a government-mandated program to eradicate patriotism at its core, with the only approved form of reproduction being forced artificial insemination of beautiful tall blonde white christian women with the seed of black men, guaranteeing a voting base for the Democrat Party as they wean a generation of government-dependent products of state-backed miscegeneation. They'll eradicate our freedoms one by one, forcing us to listen to state-approved ""multicultural"" black icons such as Pharell Williams and Iggy Azalea, singing such songs as ""Embrace Atheism [Marx is God]"" and ""F*&$ Christ, I'm a [black] Jew"" with their ethnic rhythm while inside of our two story tents. No child will ever know the joy of holding an AR-15 on their 7th birthday or the life lessons that only going to bed hungry can provide.  When all but a glimmer of hope has been exterminated from the collective psyche of God-Fearing Americans, another black helicopter--the largest of them all--will descend upon the main camp. Its tail rotor, producing shrieks of horror with every spin, will read: ""Grand Imam of the Caliphate of Al'America."" Grand Imam Barack Hussein Obama will walk down from the helicopter, shooting his guards to maintain Taqiyya, wearing a long flowing muslim robe and turban with a muslim knife on his side and the most sinister look on his face you'll have ever seen, basking in the knowledge that he fully succeeded in eradicating the American Dream by instituting a 5% tax on the wealthy and setting the minimum wage at 15 dollars, but only for fast food employees, on the condition that everyone turn in their guns. He'll walk down the halls of Camp Echo, where FEMA employee robots will salute him in the style of Nazi Germany.  Grand Imam Barack Hussein Obama will come up to one woman--untouched by the mandatory insemination program--where she'll hold in her arms the only pure white child remaining in America, and a direct descendent of Ronald Reagan. He'll throw a false mohammedian smile at the woman, grab the infant, and stab its head with his muslim knife; scattering its remains all over the floor. Afterwards, he'll slowly hand the woman a National ID and Welfare Card and say:   ""Happy Holidays"""

While this is likely a waste of both time and money I would be more concerned with a government claiming to represent us and forcing us to pay taxes for that representation then dismissing our concerns as conspiracy non-sense.  If I remember correctly they claimed the IRS targeting of Tea-Party groups was conspiracy non-sense in the beginning.

In polls, the majority of Texas citizens are not concerned about Jade Helm.  If the government represents us, shouldn't it abide by the wishes of the majority of citizens?  I guess the question becomes...to what extent should the government expend resources to quell the concerns of minority groups?    A corporation would run a cost/benefit analysis and assess the potential opportunity cost of the time/money expended.  Should the government do the same?  Who gets to decide the criteria?  What are the criteria?  I don't know if there is a way to answer the last questions objectively."

While they might need to be sued and have a court rule against them in order to have a legally binding ruling, any lawyer worth 2 cents will tell you that the Supreme Court ruling in an identical case means that they're going to rule the same way for you as well.   When it is obvious that the lowest part of the land will rule against you, you are in the wrong, legally. You won't even make it as far as the Supreme Court.  The thing about the lawyer's code of ethics is that whether or not the suit is actually legally binding doesn't matter. If it is obvious that it's a violation of the law of the land, the lawyer should not be encouraging you to do it.  There is a very good reason for this policy. A lawyer is a position of legal expertise, and should be a person you can trust to give advice that isn't going to get you placed in jail or fined. A person should not be allowed to encourage you to do criminal things such as lure a person into your home so you can shoot them while also have the backing of the approval of the Bar Association."

Why is it so outrageous to want to help educate our future without putting an entire generation in debt?   Because more taxes put the entire generation in debt, regardless if you make college ""free."" You're just moving around the wealth, not creating more of it.   In the meantime, you're restricting people's freedom because you're FORCING people to pay for college through taxation even though a lot of people don't want to go to college or don't belong in college. And THAT, in turn, reduces the amount of wealth because you're manipulating market forces in a way that causes them to be less efficient."

That is, there will not be any invoice for the person going to college.  It's PAID FOR by taxes - the current plan is to have it paid for by a small financial transaction tax.  I think you're trying to say, ""but everyone pays taxes so therefore it's not free"" and you're correct but you're just being pedantic. For example, most everyone would agree that we can all use our interstate highways for ""Free"" while also understanding that we all pay for it through taxes.  So, yeah, you're right - college would not be ""Free"" so let me clarify for your little nit-picky response by stating that college would be paid for by everyone so that everyone could attend without having to pay for it in a similar manner that our interstate highway system is ""Free"" to use even though you pay for it by taxes on gasoline."

I think it's a joke to call anything ""free"" that isn't. I don't consider it to be ""pedantic"" to call out lies when I see them. Calling it ""free"" is nothing more than deceitful salesmanship. Maybe you like voting for used car salesman. I don't.  The only novel thing about this proposal is to spread the cost of college to people who don't want or need to go to college. Why do you think people who don't go to college should pay for other people to go to college? How is that fair, exactly?"

Some people get more or less than others but everyone benefits.  Are you suggesting that the country as a whole would not benefit from having a college-educated population without crushing student loans? Are you also against using property taxes to pay for public schools?  We don't have more socialism than we can afford. We have tax loopholes that allow huge corporations and extremely rich people to get away without paying very much in taxes while the middle class and poor shoulder the bulk of the tax burden. We also have very low tax rates and out-of-control military spending.   Sanders would like to implement more socialist policies similar to successful, and popular, policies in other countries. That's not the same thing as changing the country's system of government. What part of this aren't you understanding?  Free is free. The student would not have to pay for college."

Can't lay that all on you, of course, so I just hope you're not one of those who dismisses slippery slope arguments.  I don't support SS as it exists today. And I don't support public education to some degree (I would eliminate a couple of high school years).   The question with any public spending should be ""is there a public benefit?"" I don't see it and no one has shown me what that benefit would be. It seems to me that most college students want to study liberal arts, not engineering and computer science, and I don't think we have a shortage of liberal arts degrees in this country. If you limited subsidies to careers that are needed in our country, then I might listen.   And to answer your question ""Are you suggesting that the country as a whole would not benefit from having a college-educated population without crushing student loans?""  No, I don't believe so. And btw, those crushing loans are due to the government subsidizing the loan market - college used to be VERY reasonably-priced before the government got involved in the loan business. So, the government inflates the market due to the socialization of student loans, and you think the answer is to socialize college? Does that make sense to you?   Sanders would like to implement more socialist policies similar to successful, and popular, policies in other countries. That's not the same thing as changing the country's system of government. What part of this aren't you understanding?   I don't know. What part do you think I'm NOT understanding? Have you noticed how those successful, popular policies have worked in Spain and Greece? You hope it'll turn out as good as Norway or Sweden or some other culturally-uniform country which is still relatively new to this ""Democratic socialism.""

texas,3dds2q,daisyifudo,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'm recycling this comment from about a month ago when this came up. I think it has some relevance. I also added to it a bit:  There is the opinion that Texas will never secede. Then there is only when there is a major disaster on the East Coast where D.C. goes out of comms for too long. Then there the ol' Civil War 2.0. Then maybe some global FUBAR scenario. Whatever. There are many ways that Texas could secede. Only in the face of irreparable disaster to the rest of America do I see Texas legally and without war leaving these United States of America.  Just some things that come to mind: Do I think Texas could make it as a country? Yes. With decades of preparation and building of infrastructure.  Do I think that Texas could at this moment survive by itself? No.  What happens to Texans living outside of Texas? Are they automatically qualified for dual citizenship?  Do we stage a coup and commandeer all the military assets we can?  Do we keep all the WMDs?  Do all enlisted Texans suddenly become conscripted into the new Republic and fall back to Texas soil for debriefing?   Who becomes the President? The Governor? His authority comes from the US government. The very government we'd just have burned bridges with.   With what money do we pay for anything with? Yes our economy is really strong but if we separate then I wouldn't expect D.C. to say ""Oh here is your gold guys. Sorry your cancelling your membership and I hope you rethink your decision.""  Texas has basically nothing to defend itself with from America or Mexico or anyone else for that matter unless we buy from America with their own gold (assuming we get it) and even then I imaging they'd remove any compromising military tech.   We would need a staggering amount of infrastructural preparation. Social Security, Intelligence agencies, Customs, IRS. Yeah we have offices but that is no comparison to the amount of work that would be needed to make secession a worthwhile option.  The amount of security risks that such scenarios bring up are staggering. Logistically speaking it would be in the country's best interest to prevent any state from leaving if for no other reason than to simply save tens of thousands of people from the biggest bureaucratic nightmare of the century. I don't think that most Texans who are in favor of secession really know what they are talking about but then again I honestly don't think I do either. Am I in favor of it? Sure. But legally and with preparation. It would need to be voted upon by the entire country. It would affect the world and the secessionists I know (like 5) can't think on a scale of magnitude past Texas. I've also not heard any plans for addressing the situations I mentioned above.  But this is just my opinion on the subject."

There are way bigger misappropriations of funds in this state and on the federal level for me to care about this."
texas,3d5uvi,sfoxy,0,Tue Jul 14 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"You still seem to not understand. The budget for our national military and the budget for the State Guard are completely separate. Either you think they are somehow tied together - and they aren't, Texas deploying the State Guard for no real reason wastes money that would not have been spent as such without that decision by Texas/Abbott - or you think that it doesn't matter how taxes are spent because it's all a waste in the end. Either way, it's very short sighted. Because taxes aren't well used it's no big deal if they aren't well used? Because they're not held accountable you shouldn't hold them accountable?  Texas/the State Guard aren't offering oversight. They aren't looking out for our land. If this was actually a federal takeover there wouldn't be a damn thing they could do. Anyone can observe the exercise to the same degree that the State Guard is. They aren't offering us anything special beyond wasting tax dollars. It's a political move to pander to votes from nutjobs."
texas,3d5uvi,56473829110,0,Tue Jul 14 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"I completely understand... They're both wasting our money in separate ways. Yes I understand the separation of state and federal funds. You don't seem to understand that I'm getting at a more fundamental ideology in that both these entities exist to expend/waste/leech from tax payers. What do you think the bill will be for this play date for the state? It wouldn't even register as a drop in the bucket.

I know there are libertarians within the Jade Helm freak out that will criticize military spending and criticize Jade Helm, but there are just as many Tea Party Texans who meltdown around any talk of cutting the military budget and yell about supporting our troops, while turning around and having a meltdown about Jade Helm."
texas,3d7gk5,rednoise,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"And there are a shit-ton of liberals and socialists that are cheering on Jade Helm now after having bitched and moaned about government intrusion and military spending during the Bush years. The fallacy comes in when one argues that the same people are holding these contradictory positions. It's just partisan tribal strawman bashing,"
texas,3d7gk5,ClaudeHammond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:33:38 2015 UTC,"Liberals, maybe (but this also assume that liberals are inherently anti-military spending, which they're not.) I am a Marxist, and am active in the socialist movement. I haven't heard any socialist in my circles ""cheering on"" Jade Helm. The limit of our response is a big ""So fucking what?"""
texas,3d7gk5,rednoise,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:10 2015 UTC,They're probably not cheering it on as much as mocking Texas conservatives for having a problem with it.
texas,3d7gk5,ClaudeHammond,3,Tue Jul 14 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"We are, and for the reasons I laid out previously. We can see consistency, at least, in the positions of Texas libertarians who want to put the kibosh on military spending, and who have an irrationally paranoid view of the military in Texas, but Texas conservatives who yell and scream about ""Supporting the troops"" at every turn and, like I said, meltdown at any mention of cutting the military budget -- and then they turn around and engage in paranoid fantasies about the US military trying to take over Texas (when they have never done this before, to my recollection), need to be called out.  Like I said, our response to this has been a big ""So fucking what?"" because we know the score. The military trains when they're not deployed. That's about all they do. I know this, especially, because I have had family in the military. They're going to conduct these exercises, and it has absolutely zero impact on anything."
texas,3d7gk5,rednoise,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see people running in the streets and holding a parade for the troops over this. Supporting them in this is a strong statement. People just aren't claiming that it is a conspiracy. If letting the military service do it's job and not freaking out because of routine training exercises is ""supporting"" them then that is the laziest support I've ever seen.   Not creating a scene when the military is doing job training isn't supporting them. It's just being neutral to the situation. It isn't partisan. It's just not being a total fucking idiot about the whole situation."
texas,3d7gk5,maowsers93,0,Tue Jul 14 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"I don't see people running in the streets and holding a parade for the troops over this.   And I don't see anyone ""screaming"" for military support and spending while opposing this. Can you point to any individuals doing this or are you just going to rely on this ridiculous strawman?   Not creating a scene when the military is doing job training isn't supporting them.    I meant supporting this particular operation. All the lefties are suddenly rabidly for large, wasteful military operations on our soil simply because the other team opposes it."

texas,3db2po,Tenroh_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:20 2015 UTC,I do love El Si Hay!! Do you have any other favorite taquerias in Dallas? Their wait is always so long
texas,3db2po,Tenroh_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on when you go.  I'm there almost once a week when it's warm, at the minimum once every two weeks.  You go on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night and it's generally game over - 45 minute - 1 hour wait.  You can show up around 630 and not wait too terribly long but it picks up.  During the week if you show up around 830 there's generally a short wait [unless the weather was crap for a few days prior, then you'd best show up early].  Sadly you can never tell with the Elotes, might be four people in line but someone in it is buying for their family and friends [once we were behind a lady that ordered 24.]  This past Sunday we showed up at at 8, huge amount of people - only took 15 minutes to get tacos but about 30 to get the elotes.  I can't really recommend any other place because I eat tacos often enough there I don't need them elsewhere lol.  Yeah, it's sad."
texas,3d63nc,jms1225,4,Mon Jul 13 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"These are all good points. I'd also like to mention that Houston is damn near as flat as Lubbock. It has much better drainage systems, but they can be overwhelmed, as these recent events have shown. The difference here is theres many more people to worry about than Lubbock."
texas,3d63nc,I_Know_KungFu,7,Tue Jul 14 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"In their defense, they are a fire department, not a water department."
texas,3d63nc,AniGamor,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"I don't live in Houston, but other than the port is there a reason for them to have boats and life jackets?"
texas,3d63nc,diegojones4,9,Mon Jul 13 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Any major city fire department has boat teams and swift water rescue teams usually. People drown in rivers and lakes, cars go off the road, shit like that. And every few years maybe a flooding incident. But flash floods like this one will overwhelm practically any city. A proposal to add more boats would signifixantly increase expenses, I'd imagine. It's not just ""more equipment"" that would drive up the costs, but just adding one boat team means you need 3 shifts of firefighters from that station trained on it, plus reserves."
texas,3d63nc,tonictuna,3,Mon Jul 13 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  That is why I'm not surprised they weren't completely prepared for that.  Odessa needs completely different tools and training than Galveston.  Sure, it would be nice to have everything but you can't afford everything.  Plus Houston is huge so I would imagine individual departments have different things."
texas,3d63nc,diegojones4,4,Mon Jul 13 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"I live in Dallas, so I'm most familiar with stuff here.  Marine 1 (for the large lake here)  Swift Water 34 (the only swift water team for the city)  And I can't find a photo, but they have 2-3 stations with a ""flat water boat"" similar to this; maybe a little smaller."
texas,3d63nc,tonictuna,2,Mon Jul 13 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"So if Dallas had a flood like Houston just had, we'd be seeing an almost identical headline?"
texas,3d63nc,diegojones4,4,Mon Jul 13 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point is that so would any major city. But I don't think that means everyone needs to go buy 10 more boats and train 50 more firefighters. Lifejackets make sense, though. Every major city probably have similar resources, or can access them through a county mutual aid system, but it's extremely rare that each of those specialized teams are busy. So how much money/resources do you spend on a once in a 10+ year event? Or whatever the period.  Even during one of the flooding events Dallas had there weren't enough resources for a little while. The fire engine crew at the stations with the flat water boats are trained to operate them. So when the call comes for a boat, they load up in a Suburban that tows the boat trailer, and they leave the fire engine at the station. Well, one of those engines was already on a high water rescue call and it actually got flooded out and stalled, so one boat team was immediately out of service. I was monitoring the scanner that night and it was a circus like that all across the city."
texas,3d63nc,tonictuna,3,Mon Jul 13 23:57:33 2015 UTC,Rather than buying life jackets it would make more sense to have a line of credit at academy of something.  Just putting them in storage they will eventually go bad.
texas,3d63nc,diegojones4,2,Tue Jul 14 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing that damages life jackets is being in the water, followed by UV exposure.  Life jackets are cheap enough that you can buy in bulk and keep them in a locker at the station for a few years at a time without incurring significant replacement costs.  just check them every so often like you would any other equipment."

There may be non-fatty pieces that aren't made of cardboard, but even if there are they'll dry out by the time you get to your table. Having fat in and around the meat keeps moisture in place until you get it into your mouth. I never much liked beef brisket until I tried fatty brisket at the right places, and now I know that it's delicious. I'll still pick ribs or tenderloin over it though."

texas,3d4lov,OtulGib,4,Mon Jul 13 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"I have always been under the impression that the flat is the 'lean' and that moist and fatty are interchangeable terms for the point.    I have never heard of 'wet' brisket, unless it was referring to sauce."

texas,3d4lov,WayneRooneysHairPlug,2,Mon Jul 13 18:43:47 2015 UTC,A brisket packer is made up of two separate cuts of meat. The point and the flat. Generally when you order brisket you are getting the flat but IMO the point is much better.   Here is a very crude diagram showing the two cuts.  http://www.kingwood.com/message_board/forumimgs/148163556121290.jpg
texas,3d4lov,rap31264,0,Mon Jul 13 19:41:56 2015 UTC,Fat content. I believe the point/flat are actually two muscles that are sold together in the same cut.

texas,3d4lov,Pepe_Silvia,2,Mon Jul 13 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, it really shouldn't. But the lean stuff is definitely more likely to be dry, especially at the end of the day."
texas,3d4lov,WayneRooneysHairPlug,2,Mon Jul 13 18:48:58 2015 UTC,Moist just means there's more fat in that part of the brisket (which makes it... uh... more moist)  It's much easier for lean meat to dry out than fatty meat (think oven roasted turkey vs meat loaf - which one is easier to overcook?)
texas,3d4lov,MKROBINSON,6,Mon Jul 13 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"In Austin there's a lot of good options, but the easiest that also tastes amazing is Black's BBQ. Get the fatty brisket. It's incredible."

But I've had a few times that it just didn't turn out great. And this can be due to a variety of variables. So you might just be having bad luck. As mentioned before, the moist brisket is the best.

At worst, we waste some money but local military gets some observation training, and those 200 volunteers get to feel useful. At best, we catch something that the Army overlooked in terms of property damage or public safety and get it covered so it doesn't cost the locals anything.   I don't see why this is such a big deal, unless the guy organizing the volunteer stuff isn't as thorough about keeping the nut jobs out as he thinks, and one of them gets themselves or someone else hurt.

I don't think they're staging some takeover, but there's no problem with locals keeping an eye on things and making sure they're not leaving a trail of junk behind them, or damaging state or private property on accident. And if they do, then you can document it and have it paid for without having the locals foot the bill.   Again.. I don't see how this is a big deal. The vast majority of people aren't expecting nefarious government takeovers. I don't see why I should be embarrassed by a few obvious nutjobs.  We're supposed to be allowed to have local militia and state military specifically to keep tabs on the federal military, why not exercise that ability, as long as people aren't investing in tin-foil and acting stupid with guns?  So they didn't do the same for ""Operation Roadrunner"" (which I'd honestly never heard of). Big deal, people didn't coordinate stuff as well on the internet then. It doesn't make people more crazy now, or make them hypocritical, because again, it's not a huge segment of the population who actually care about this.  If you know people who are scared ""the gubment is comin' ta take yer guns"" (likely 5 or 6 of us) then tell them they're more than welcome to stock up on ammo and rations and hole up for a couple of months and stimulate the local prepper economy, but don't go out with your weapons to monitor troop movements. Just follow the reports from the people who are organized and NOT crazy.  Seems silly that we're all trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  EDIT: Also, tell me why I'm wrong and downvote, don't just downvote pls. I actually think this contributes to the conversation, even if I do happen to be wrong.

Or using CIA planes to fake out our cell phones and track us. Or using the IRS to punish people with the wrong politics. Why shouldn't we trust the government that blackmailed MLK?"
texas,3d3shg,txyesboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"And I should add that, all the examples you gave above, are examples of paranoia in action. The administrations who conducted these atrocities and abused their power, were usually war time administrations; who felt their ""ends justified the means"" in some way. Even the current administrations' CIA wire tapping and invasions of privacies are unacceptable - but these aren't specific to the Obama Administration and have been going on for as long as the technology has existed. The military has been conducting ""exercises"" for over a hundred years; all right under the noses of the civilianry; we have known and accepted this for as long as it has gone on; because - where the hell else do they have to conduct these experiments?  Bottom line though is this: why such outrage now versus all the other military exercises conducted in Texas?  Because even the GOVERNOR has said he has concerns of the current administration having conspicuous reasons behind being in Texas with this exercise; so much so, he wants the Texas National Guard deployed to ""monitor"" these activities. One need not read very deeply to see the reasoning behind the chess move by Abbott here. No one has even said what it is Abbott and others are skeptical about specifically. It's all wink-wink politico speak; geared at riling up the liberty or death crowd in Texas, and further build an even deeper chasm between the rivaling political parties of this nation. And they say the middle class is dwindling down in numbers; well that's not just in terms of monetary standing, but from a political one as well.  Concerned over these ""activities"" in our backyard? That's your perogative and I can't change that. But the concerns you have seem to stem from worst case scenario, and are being fueled by Bogeyman talk by Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz - without even the slightest morsel of evidence to back their fears or justify their defensive posture.  And THAT is why this is paranoia. I saw in another one of these Jade Helm posts from a Texan in active duty stationed in another state who made it pretty clear that; if there REALLY were to be military action taken here in Texas (i.e. - imposing martial law) there is no way in hell that's happening; given the vast majority of Texans in active duty. They would NEVER turn on their home state, or harm it in any way."
texas,3d3shg,ClaudeHammond,4,Tue Jul 14 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"The administrations who conducted these atrocities and abused their power, were usually war time administrations; who felt their ""ends justified the means"" in some way.   We have a ""war time"" administration right now. Most of the atrocities I pointed out happened during the Bush/Obama years. Not very comforting...   but these aren't specific to the Obama Administration and have been going on for as long as the technology has existed.   Not increasing my trust level of the government here. Is this you admitting they're not some ""war time"" measure?   Bottom line though is this: why such outrage now versus all the other military exercises conducted in Texas?   Because the crookedness of the government has been better exposed in the last ten years, thanks in part to the difficulty of censoring the internet.   One need not read very deeply to see the reasoning behind the chess move by Abbott here.   You don't need to read at all if you're just going to assume the worst.   But the concerns you have seem to stem from worst case scenario, and are being fueled by Bogeyman talk by Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz   No, they're being fueled by the Orwellian nightmare that is the US government.   They would NEVER turn on their home state, or harm it in any way.   Yeah, I'm sure people in other countries that became totalitarian thought that."
texas,3d3shg,txyesboy,-2,Tue Jul 14 03:16:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you feel that way. There is a fine line, however, between pragmatism and distrust.   Distrust means you not only don't believe in your government; you expect them to do wrong.  There's a common thread among people who continue to co-exist in a world of distrust - it reflects their own behavior and mindset. That mindset spills into most everything they do.   Remember this: this IS a democracy - this government you so distrust reflects you, and me, and everyone who is governed by her laws.  I'm not saying our government hasn't engaged in atrocities of many different types over its' 200+ years of existence; but no nation is without its shames and missteps.   Ultimately, if you distrust your government, you distrust yourself; as they are us. And sadly, you cannot deny this by the straw man argument of ""but I didn't vote for <President name>"" because you accepted the democratic nature of our government. If you disavow this, and deny your government and its Commander in Chief, you're no American, sir.  Lastly, if you've made the logical leap of all the atrocities above to the aforementioned military exercise, it's no wonder you feel that you're not paranoid schizophrenic."
texas,3d3shg,ClaudeHammond,3,Tue Jul 14 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"Distrust means you not only don't believe in your government; you expect them to do wrong.   And if I expect them to do wrong because they're constantly doing wrong? Please go on about how this is all in my head.   Remember this: this IS a democracy - this government you so distrust reflects you, and me, and everyone who is governed by her laws.   What laws enable the extrajudicial execution of American citizens, universal wiretapping, torture, and bioweapons experiments on citizens?   Ultimately, if you distrust your government, you distrust yourself; as they are us.   Bullshit. The government is run by elites. Democratic input is not functional in our system. The people in Washington are not ""me"" and it is an absurd argument when you claim that distrusting them means distrusting myself.   Lastly, if you've made the logical leap of all the atrocities above to the aforementioned military exercise, it's no wonder you feel that you're not paranoid schizophrenic.   I feel I'm not paranoid schizoprhenic because I'm not. And the military carries out most of these atrocities. Expound on why we should trust them in this instance.

I lived in CT for several years and it was a $10/month adder for auto glass and required no deductible to replace a windshield.

texas,3d4mfu,texasguy911,2,Mon Jul 13 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"Glass damage is always covered under the comprehensive portion of the physical damage coverage. Some states have special glass waivers, where windshield replacement is covered in full with no deductible applied. Texas has no such thing, so any replacement is subject to your comp deductible. Claim history is always important, but individually comp claims do not cause an increase in premiums on their own. I would file a claim if you have a low deductible, and haven't had a large number of claims in the last year or two."

texas,3d1o9b,DecD,3,Sun Jul 12 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"The wife and I have been to all three:  In order from most to least favorite:   Garner is my favorite Texas SP (visited once in Fall 2014 that I've visited) and is very well equipped for a state park (lots of hiking, caves, even a small restaurant, lots of campsites, hot showers), including a few areas meant specifically for kids. It has some of the best state park views within a day trip from Austin. The only downside, from what I remember, was the campsites are a bit close together. It also has really good 4G access (on AT&T). I once streamed a Texas game while out there. Lost Maples is very hilly and beautiful (visited a few times, also in Fall 2014). We've been here a few times. We've covered most of the hiking here in about 1.5-2 days. Very beautiful in the fall (when the maple trees are changing colors), but it's hard to book campsites then. Campsites were more spread out than Garner, but I could still hear my neighbors' snoring. There's no cell phone access at all. Hill Country SNA: It's been a few years since we went here, but I recall it being very beautiful (although my least favorite of the 3). It's less popular than the other two, so not as crowded (although we weren't there on Spring Break). IIRC, Hill Country SNA does not have any water available in the park, so you'll need to bring all your own water.   Garner and Lost Maples are about an hour apart driving, so it's very possible to do both on your trip (you could do all three, but it'll be a little rushed). There's a great casual restaurant called Lost Maples Cafe that has awesome pie.  Be sure to book well in advance. Spring Break is a popular time for camping."
texas,3d1o9b,iliveintexas,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input!  We'll probably pick two- likely Garner and Lost Maples.  I agree that three would be too much pitching/striking/packing/unpacking.    I've been thinking of going to Big Bend next spring break, but am now considering waiting one more year (the smaller kid is only 4) to open up more hiking options.  I think these parks will be a ton of fun for next spring's big trip."
texas,3d1o9b,iliveintexas,3,Sun Jul 12 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"I also went there last Fall. Very long drive out there, but very beautiful. The only possible issue with small kids in Big Bend is the black bears or mountain lions on the trails. Both aren't usually big issues for adults and groups, but smaller children could be targets for bears and large cats.  We didn't sight any while we were there, but another family we ran into on the trail (with two small kids) did see a black bear at a distance.  I haven't heard of any incidents recently with black bears. There was one in 2012 involving a kid and a mountain lion. The kid survived.  I'm sure you know this, but in case anyone reading doesn't, read up on safety around big wildlife before you go."
texas,3d1o9b,HappyinAustin,2,Sun Jul 12 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Garner is always MUCH more crowded than the other two. Many young people, boom boxes, beer, etc. One woman who runs some cabins in the Hill Country refers to ""Garner people,"" meaning partiers. I would rule it out for the little ones.  The other two places are awesome; HCSNA the more rugged of the two."

texas,3cwqlv,LibertyLessons4Kids,63,Sat Jul 11 13:03:50 2015 UTC,Weren't police forces originally supposed to be just citizens on patrol? When did these people stop being citizens and became authority figures above the law that applies to the rest of us?
texas,3cwqlv,geoman91,48,Sat Jul 11 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"For anyone actually interested in an answer to your question In a nutshell, the expansion of police forces from simple night watchmen patrols began in the 1830s at the behest of the manufacturing class in the US to enforce social order (including drunkenness, vagrancy etc.) directed primarily at the recent immigrant/poor class to increase overall productivity and profit. The militarization (i.e., firm bureaucratization and strict training of police along military lines) really took off toward the end of the 19th century, as the rising industrial and trust class pushed to arm police more strongly and give them more authority to regulate strikers and dissenting workers. Police were trained to identify themselves as opposed to the majority of society and see themselves as a separate entity whose duty it was to regulate and control the masses without feeling empathy or belonging to the mass of workers and citizens or their own ethnic heritage. ""Professionalization"" was a process that created a distinctly different subset of citizens whose training was aimed at removing their sense of identification with the rest of society."

texas,3cwqlv,StandingByToStandBy,3,Sun Jul 12 01:46:43 2015 UTC,Really?  So some under achiever who barely passed the police academy is a better option? Us war vets are actually not afraid of the general population like most cops seem to be.  We've had to work with Afghanistans and Iraq's military forces. They all have weapons and we don't know who is legit or not.  So we have to trust them until they prove otherwise.
texas,3cwqlv,skxek1,10,Sun Jul 12 02:37:03 2015 UTC,"I think many are probably good choices as people, but a police officer, in my opinion, should be at least five years removed from combat duty. The general populace is not Iraqi or Afghan; We're US citizens, and an ""us vs them"" mentality, pervasive in many departments these days, is not helpful.  They shouldn't be ""afraid of the general population,"" but they owe a lot more respect and courtesy to that population than they are did the foreign populations they had to interact with as a soldier."
texas,3cwqlv,SoMuchNot,2,Sat Jul 11 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"Why would a soldier who went overseas to potentially die for the very people in their country contribute to an ""us VS them"" mentality any more than your average citizen cop? Also why would there be the assumption that our soldiers shit on the citizens of another country more or less than they would shit on US citizens? Being a piece of shit to everyone you meet in the Middle East isn't going to win you any favors as a soldier, contrary to the bigoted beliefs of some (a belief I will not assume you personally have).  Their whole point is that a soldier is far better trained and likely more prone to deescalation than just going guns blazing into whatever the hell scenario they decide. And because they were brought up to serve and protect their country, not police their country, they are quite possibly more invested in the well being of those they were willing to die to protect than a cop might be.  There's plenty of good cops. There's plenty of shitty soldiers. But soldiers are not some PTSD hot-heads ready to blow every citizen's head off as if they were some enemy combatant.  But there seems to be some notion in what you said that our military is over in the Middle East just treating whoever like shit and acting like everyone is the enemy... which is just so not the case it's unbelievable. I find it hard to believe you actually mean that or think it, and it must just be miscommunication.  That said, though, the police force is not the military. If you are arguing from that point of view alone, I can understand the sentiment. But I think the concern that a veteran would step into the shoes of an officer and immediately treat American civilians like combatants is paranoid and no more likely than any hot-headed civilian becoming a cop and doing the same."
texas,3cwqlv,Riaayo,3,Sat Jul 11 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Where do you come up with the 5 year rule?  Any studies or facts that state after 5 years removed from combat, you are again a ""normal"" contributer to society? I agree the police should not look at it as they are against all of us.  None of that is taught in the Army and veterans make up a smaller percentage of police in the country compared to non-veterans.  What I mean by not afraid of the general population, is that I feel we have better situational awareness of a true threat.  A guy with a rifle slinged around his shoulder walking down the street, wouldn't freak me out so badly that I had to grab my rifle.  What do you mean show more respect and courtesy to the population than we did to the foreign population?  Are hands were so tied behind our back that being proactive in finding insurgents was basically a crime in Afghanistan.  We are not allowed to search villages,  step in a mosque,  or even acknowledge the local women.  These rules were set by president Hamid Karzai.  I and my unit never went out of our way to abuse or disrespect the locals in any way."

texas,3cwqlv,Legionof1,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"When I see news footage of, say, a gas station robbery taken from security cam footage, I've never seen the suspect using a cellphone to text as a weapon. A ""little rifle"", on the other hand...."
texas,3cwqlv,txyesboy,-1,Sun Jul 12 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, you said a bimbo texting in a car. Ergo, the bimbo is the one brandishing the weapon, and technically, the cellphone is the trigger of the weapon, because without her texting, she wouldn't have used her car in the exact scenario you described to kill someone. Also, the point of emphasis isn't the car vs. the rifle. People aren't afraid of the car itself. General public perception is that a car is a means of transportation; ergo, while we know a great majority of human lives are lost as a result of automobiles - even some where the automobile is used deliberately as a weapon, rather than just an accidental means - but ultimately, we still prioritize and identify an automobile for what it is and what it's purpose is- transportation. By contrast, people can be ""scared"" of a little rifle, because a little rifle's only purpose is to cause harm. It has no other practical function other than that of a weapon; either to inflict either deliberate physical harm, or by means of intimidation, or by means of show of force.  So, know that you know what a false comparison is, do you now understand why your statement of why people should be not scared of a rifle, because it's no more dangerous than a ""bimbo texting in the car"" is a false comparison, and doesn't make sense?  On top of that, does that also help you to understand why resorting to name calling to try to validate your point don't help validate the point either?"

And then there's the way the Founders expressed it decades later at the time of ratification...  ""It is obviously impracticable in the Federal Government of these States to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstance, as on the object to be obtained.""  I don't have it handy, but years later Franklin totally contradicted young Franklin. Politicians use rhetoric as it suits them. Context matters.  And Madison said a government without power of force is like no government at all. He said that because, even though it's self evident stupid malcontents refuse to acknowledge it.   Let's face it. OCT, C.J. Grisham, Kory Watkins et. al.; these idiots aren't about ""rights"" in the plural. They're about one gun right, period. They don't legitimately petition government for redress. On a good day they're well behaved but they vacillate between that and bellicosity, truculence, petulance, whatever suits their juvenile mood swings. And always with the in-your-face, confrontational, combative fuck anybody that disagrees; whether it's diminishing the legacy of Gonzales with co-opting the battle flag or intimidating state legislators. Their hallmark is asocial arrested development, their method is intimidation.  And let's not overlook the underlying reality. Handguns are a plague on American cities and always have been.

How am I supposed to know that you are legally of age to get these services unless you show me some ID?""

texas,3cwqlv,KevinBrown,9,Sat Jul 11 15:01:32 2015 UTC,Presumption of innocence trumps this. As the officer has no way to KNOW he is in violation of either of those then he has no probable cause. If nothing illegal is happening the police have no power to stop and check you or require ID.

Wanna know why people get pissy when they see someone CARRYING a firearm? Wanna know why the media always misidentifies anything NOT a handgun as an assault rifle? It's simple, really - the MAJORITY of the United States' population neither OWN a weapon, nor identify with the gun culture. Their interpretation immediately when they see someone NOT in an identifiable private sector uniform holding a weapon is ""that person IS a threat.....or at the very least, a concern""  Why is that so hard for some people to understand?  Not everyone is saying you are a bad person for being that way; nor are they saying they actively want to TAKE your guns away, either. All the MAJORITY of people want to see is more discretion, accountability, self-awareness, and understand their surroundings and the effect displaying their rights has on others.  Sorry for the rant; I'm sure I'll get downvotes for the emphatic nature of my opinion. For the record, I am PRO gun rights; I own 3 pistols, one rifle and have a Texas CHL; I just personally think there SHOULD be limits to what should be considered acceptable vs unacceptable display of our gun rights - and I have yet to have anyone provide me a valid reason in TODAY'S society, why one would need to open carry a long rifle FOR PROTECTION (as opposed to ""well officer, if you didn't notice we're in the middle of a southeast Texas swamp, hunting feral hogs?

texas,3cwqlv,txyesboy,3,Sun Jul 12 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'm getting at: in order for a police officer to legally stop someone for any reason (to see their ID, to check them for outstanding warrants, to ask them what flavor ice cream they like best, etc.) they must BY LAW have reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed. Openly carrying a long gun in the state of Texas is perfectly legal. If all the officer knows is that someone is carrying a gun, they simply do not have reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed. That means they cannot stop that person and make them provide an ID. If they go ahead and stop the person anyway, the officer is violating their civil right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. Full stop.  Your argument has nothing to do with intent. It has nothing to do with the officer serving his community. His community has, by electing a legislature that recognizes the right to carry a long gun in public, determined that the community is best served by permitting the legal, open carry of said gun. If the community changes its mind and elects a legislature that changes this law, that's different. But that's not the current reality.  The reality is that a police officer who presumes the guilt of someone not committing a crime and stopping them to search them or compel their identification (whether that's someone with a legally carried gun or someone on their way to get an abortion) is violating that person's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.  You disagree with the law. That's fine. But it's still the law and you being uncomfortable with that doesn't change the fact that our police officers serve us better when they obey the laws that prevent them from hassling us rather than forgetting the rules that restrain them when they feel like it."

After 1/1/2016 when open carrying and the person has a CHL YOU CANNOT BE STOPPED simply for open carrying the pistol to check if you are carrying a CHL. It would be a violation of the constitution (4th ammdt.). Of course, some police are open in their contempt for that document so there will be stops and there will be lawsuits until an explicit clarification amendment is passed (as it almost was when Open Carry of handguns passed).   This has been a public service announcement. Ithangyew."

He didnt do anything wrong.  The ""law"" that the cop is operating on, was built on an older system of law. The rifleman is exercising that old law. The rifleman also broke the law of courteousness or politeness. He flat out refused a man who was doing his job of responding to alarms. Hence why cops can pin you with intereference of justice, or whatever they call it, just for tendering a refusal.  The rifleman did a great job of sidestepping the legal traps set by the Citizen On Patrol, an officer of a court FYI. Anything agreed to or said in front of a cop is done so as if done with the court he represents. You better not understand any questioning. Understanding it makes it valid to you, makes it good law to you, for you."

It does not matter how a rife or a black man seems scary to you, your fear alone does not justify a valid alarm. Law does.

texas,3cwqlv,texasguy911,5,Sun Jul 12 15:29:45 2015 UTC,WTF are your rambling...
texas,3cwqlv,Legionof1,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"Everybody here is very confident that the gun-carrier was doing nothing illegal. But given the guy's behavior, I think a very reasonable argument could be made that he was carrying his gun in a way ""calculated to cause alarm."""
texas,3cwqlv,dkesh,4,Sun Jul 12 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Here's the exact quote:  Q: Can I Open Carry in Texas (in Public)?  A: You can openly carry rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. A CHL is not needed to do this. However, you must do so in a manner not ""calculated"" to cause alarm; meaning you are carrying the rifle to purposely intimidate or scare people.  I think the definition at the end is a bit short sighted to only assume that ""calculated"" can only refer to purposely intimidating  or scaring people.   But honestly, there's a significant divide here in logic regarding the law itself. Many I've read here say ""it's the law, it's our right""....yes, yes it is. But for what PURPOSE does one seek to utilize this right? For example, what is this guy doing with this rifle? The initial response from defenders of this law say immediately ""it doesn't matter, it's his right; end of story"".  But any law has to be enacted to have a purpose. A purpose is a means to an end. Enabling this person the right to carry that weapon is not something in which, given the 2nd amendment, if you took the ability to carry long rifles away in public, would not invalidate his 2nd amendment rights. Why? because you could still carry many other weapons legally. Weapons such as holstered handguns. Weapons more in line with modern self-defense practicalities.  Which brings us back to the point of: why WOULD he carry this weapon down the street - REGARDLESS of his legal right to do so. He chose to arm himself with this specific weapon for a purpose. There are numerous he could've chose to have on his person - many of which that wouldn't have drawn scrutiny from a LEO...but he chose that one.  The story suggests he was a demonstrator? What's he demonstrating? Demonstrators - by definition - are usually demonstrating AGAINST laws that discriminate (or, to rally support for causes that exist, but are under scrutiny). The 2nd Amendment is not under attack; nor is the ability to carry a long rifle on one's person in Texas. Not only that, you aren't even required to have a CHL, or be forced to present ID if confronted. If anything, wearing THIS PARTICULAR WEAPON is the LAST type of weapon a ""demonstrator"" would need to be wearing....as this weapon has secured itself every sacred cow right gun rights owners WANT.   So, again, why - besides the fact that he has the legal right to wear it - was he wearing THIS weapon, while carrying a camera, and being asked specific questions by a law enforcement officer, being uncooperative with the officer, under the guise of being a ""demonstrator""? What's he ""demonstrating""? That he can bait a beat cop into going on video with him, in the attempts to try to make law enforcement's job even HARDER than it already is? ESPECIALLY one that told him specifically, ""dude, I'm on your side, I believe in your cause....""  It all seemed to be a waste of time, and served no really purpose but to give respectable and responsible gun owners a further bad name, and try to bring down the respect levels of local law enforcement even more."

It is quite obviously wrong, but it is only quite obviously wrong if you have had an upbringing that taught you proper science, history, and critical thinking. If you were raised in an environment where religious history was given to you as the only truth and you were told to believe in your faith and disregard ""truth"" as lies, then can you really blame that person for how they were programmed?  Children believe in Santa when their parents tell them he is real. ""But children stop believing in Santa at a certain age"". Yes, when they are told, generally when their parents confirm that it was in fact not true, and because unlike God or the age of the planet the average person can very easily by themselves determine if a fat man really is coming into their house and dropping presents off.  While obviously science itself can tell us the world's age and even a basic education should provide you with what you need to look at the evidence of rock layers and all that to determine oh, well, yeah that seems about right, you still can't really walk up to a rock as an average person and KNOW it's X years old.  So while I think it is extremely important to combat ignorance, telling people they are idiots because of how they were brought up and how they trusted their authority figures during their upbringing is extremely unfair."

They police are the front line of stupidity and audacity and remind me of Judge Dredd. I AM THE LAW!!! Or Cartman: Respect mah authoritae!   One of my clients is a P.I. and one of his process servers was arrested for contempt of court while trying to serve the judge legal papers during a lull in court. He had tried to do it at the judge's home, but the judge pulled a gun on him. This was over two years ago and to my knowledge, the process server is STILL awaiting trial. He almost lost his process server license because of this charge. There was tampered video evidence (a cop brought the server's pen cam HOME with him!) and falsified witness statements (proven wrong by the video). The video was NOT allowed to be introduced into evidence and the court transcriptioner (is that the right word) refused to give up her own recording as it would exonerate the server and show that she and 20 other prosecutors, judges, and police officers LIED on the their statements.

texas,3cut9b,gAlienLifeform,5,Fri Jul 10 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"How is that even legal?  Can this guy who's been with the Waco PD for 26 years actually say he hasn't had previous interactions  or relationships with any of the officers involved, and shouldn't the legal system avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts of interest?  Saying, ""the system is random, so it's okay that we ended up with someone who may be biased"" is just whitewash.    I also wouldn't want to be on that jury:  locked in a room with this guy leading the discussion while wearing a badge and a gun on his side.  I don't think it's unlikely that would subconsciously if not directly cause some of the milder personalities not to argue opinions that dissent from his own."

There is no screening process to weed out conflicts of interest or bias.  There is little to no instruction and generally no knowledge of the law shared.  It's a sham system anymore, it was originally to prevent the goverment from bringing false charges against people.  Now it's used in the way it was intended to prevent because of the lack of screening and instructions."

texas,3cr6n3,TheRighteousTyrant,3,Fri Jul 10 09:01:05 2015 UTC,"Garner Sate Park, about 2-3 hours drive from Austin. One of the most popular state parks so lots of campsites crammed close together & it's really difficult to get a spot last-minute during spring/fall. It's even crowded in the heat of August. No backcountry camping but there's a decent trail system. I do not think you could do much rock climbing there, at least not any that's park-endorsed. The hill/cliff in the picture is right on the edge of the park property & many of the hikers probably are on private property when they hike up there (no one has ever yelled at us, though, not sure if the owners care). There are some small caves, though, and the Frio river runs right through.  Lost Maples is right down the road, maybe less than an hour away. I like Garner hill country but Lost Maples blew me away when I finally visited. There are more flat places around & in Garner than at LM."

Many times people say this and they're not actually from Dallas, but surrounding suburbs and grew up there, never actually having experienced the true city life that Dallas has to offer. And natural recreational opportunities in the area are plentiful too. Of course, I may be a bit biased, as I'm from here.

As you go up, there are some opportunities to traverse parts of the face itself, albeit you can tell the park staff have tried to block them off (note how the old sites directly below the face are long closed due to falling rocks; that danger also exists on the face, as well as the danger of you falling, so proceed that way at your own risk). The summit -- you're there when you find the massive pile of rocks --- offers great views all around as well as the only location in the park with Sprint service.

Honestly, a good portion (greater than 25%) of India's population is barely surviving, so they really are not in shape to fight.  Of course the U.S. has its own poverty stricken citizens as well.   With over 7B people in the world, even 20:1 means we barely win if we take on the whole world.  That's conventional of course.  Nukes bring in a whole different ratio."

There's more on that on this page on self defense  where the relevant advice boils down to ""don't challenge him"".  That said, cops may be human, but they should be better than this.  They should not respond to challenges in the same way as a common criminal.

texas,3col8n,dougmc,9,Thu Jul 9 18:07:00 2015 UTC,They should not respond to challenges in the same way as a common criminal.   That's the point. The cop responded like an uncommon criminal - one who can have his crimes caught on video and get paid vacation as punishment.
texas,3col8n,erveek,-11,Thu Jul 9 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're the only person on this thread who took my point.  ""Force the guy to choose between losing face or doing what was suggested""—That's exactly right.  I think the cop responded appropriately. He was being verbally/visually challenged while he was already dealing with an unknown person he was trying to arrest. The cop told the guy to back away, and he didn't.  Anyway, thank you for your thoughtful comment. I would ask you to think about a cop being verbally assaulted VIRTUALLY CONSTANTLY during his day—that's when the human takes over the training, I think."
texas,3col8n,HappyinAustin,13,Fri Jul 10 00:51:00 2015 UTC,He was being verbally/visually challenged   How old are you? This cop has a tiny ego and didn't like being told what to do. Does that give him the right to assault someone minding their business on their own property?   How badly were you picked on as a kid?
texas,3col8n,oneeyedsamurai,3,Thu Jul 9 19:20:17 2015 UTC,". I would ask you to think about a cop being verbally assaulted VIRTUALLY CONSTANTLY during his day   If he can't handle being verbally assaulted consistently during the day, then he's in the line of work.  Hundreds of thousands of cops deal with bullshit on a daily basis and don't cross the line between being professional and inappropriate behavior.  Yes, the guy provoked the cop, but the cop shouldn't have allowed himself to be baited in to acting inappropriately.  In this situation, shoving the guy to the ground like a school-yard bully was inappropriate behavior.    I'm not anti-cop and I fully respect that their job is a difficult one, but as I said, hundreds of thousands of them do the job every day without acting inappropriately and the ones that do act inappropriately may not be cut out for that line of work."

If your point is that the guy screwed up and the cop responded properly, then no, I didn't take your point.  I think they both need to work on their impulse control.   I think the cop responded appropriately.   Responding to somebody whose only problem is a big mouth with violence is not a cop responding appropriately.  Cops are allowed to use violence when needed, yes, but a guy whose only problem is a big mouth doesn't qualify.  Saying ""it's my property now"" was a mistake -- that made things worse, not better.  Instead, the cop should have explained that he legally has the right to be there, and will be gone as soon as he's done."

texas,3ch4sa,Hank_Fuerta,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:08 2015 UTC,It used to be illegal for a concealed weapon to be seen at all.  Even if it was by accident you could be cited by the police.  They changed the law so that if a concealed pistol was accidentally exposed it was no longer an offense.  Now you can open carry if you have a license to carry concealed which to some people means they're further protected in an accidental exposure moment but others don't see the point.

Wheel gun vs auto, chamber preference, condition preference, thumb safety preference, caliber preference, ammo type preference etc etc etc.  It's all preferences. I prefer an auto with no thumb safety/safety off, one in the chamber, and openly carried in a level 2 OWB holster.  You prefer a different setup. I completely respect that.

texas,3ch4sa,txyesboy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"If anyone hasn't already notice my particularly anti-open carry views in this thread, maybe a little backstory might help frame my mindset. I live in East Fort Worth/West Arlington border, and in the past year or two, the local chapter of the Open Carry movement went rogue up here, and were being pretty belligerent about their point of emphasis to brandish AR's in Lincoln Square restaurants and stores in Arlington in late 2013.   http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2013/11/in-an-arlington-strip-mall-a-showdown-between-open-carry-advocates-and-four-moms-in-a-blue-mesa.html/  I happened to have been shopping there one of the days they did this, and not only did (note - my OPINION, nothing more, nothing less) look ridiculous doing so, they made a great deal of people there very uncomfortable due to their presence. They weren't exactly being very open minded to communication, and were slightly indignant to some of the stores' and restaurants' requests to leave their weapons out of their establishments.  I should note, that these folks were there claiming to be representative of Open Carry Texas overall - but eventually their local DFW chapter was disowned by Open Carry Texas, for their more outlandish and disrespectful means of trying to ""force the issue"" of sensible open carry laws. So, the point being, I know not ALL Open Carry advocates are as ""off the deep end"" as these folks were - it's not fair to generalize - but from the limited personal experience I had with pro-open carry advocates. Through these whackos - and my generally held belief that, not only is conceal carry more than sufficient but also offers a more tactical advantage - this is at least an explanation as to why my mindset has been framed the way it is."

Believe me I'm a big open carry proponent and the fact that we have always been able to open carry rifles should have been more well known and not nearly the big deal its been made out to be, but they went about it the wrong way and really played into the image of gun toting nutjobs. Too many peoples only experience with guns is through TV and movies so guns are scary and anyone who likes them is a ""gun nut"" and I would think that mindset wouldnt be so prevalent here in Texas but it is. 12 guys on the corner waving the Gonzales flag with their rifles slung isnt going to get any soccer mom or office dad  on our side. And I dont buy into the argument that having a pistol on your hip makes you a target, yet no one blinks when cops walk into a restaurant with their bat belt full of lethal and non lethal goodies, and thats a big problem for me. Its an ""occupied"" mindset, that there are two classes of citizens. Too many people have abdicated their rights to self protection and look askance at those who pick up the mantle. Its sad, and it says a lot about our society. I think the more that people are exposed to open carry, as it becomes more prevalent, this attitude will change but they're scared, they're nervous and the TV isnt helping so we have to ease them into it, not militantly shove it in their faces."

texas,3ch4sa,thephotoman,10,Tue Jul 7 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the guy carrying a pistol on his belt is not making a statement.  You're unlikely to notice it on first glance.  He's just exercising his now-legal rights.  The guy carrying two rifles, on the other hand, is making one hell of a statement.  He's saying, ""I'm paranoid, and if you make one wrong move, I'm going to blow your head off.""  Come on.  Two rifles is a little excessive, don't you think?  (The guy carrying one rifle tells me ""I'm going hunting/I just came back from hunting."")"
texas,3ch4sa,MagicWishMonkey,5,Tue Jul 7 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"Statistically, the guy with the handgun is much more of a threat than the guy with two rifles. >80% of firearm related homicides involve a handgun."

This is a perfectly reasonable response. Your rights aren't being infringed upon by concealing a gun, so why insist on the option that makes people uncomfortable?

And that includes not being constantly reminded that a stranger - that you don't know if you can trust - has a firearm. Conceal your weapon, and LITERALLY everybody wins.

texas,3ch4sa,txyesboy,15,Wed Jul 8 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Tired of feeling like a minority in this debate. And from previous debates elsewhere, where I was labeled as a ""hippie"" or a ""bleeding heart liberal"" etc., I kindly remind people I own firearms AND have a CHL.   I see different various analogies below to your comment about people with big muscles etc.....here's my go at an analogy that I think best sums up my thoughts on this:  Ever take martial arts? You learn a LOT about strength, valor, honor, respect- and of course - self respect.   If you were to black belt in a martial arts, you would clearly have shown the discipline required to acquire such a skill set. And your instructors would bestow that honor upon you, because you proved not only your physical skill in order to fight and defend yourself (and subsequently others around you), BUT that you also had the discipline and self-control to KNOW your WEAPON isn't a weapon at all.   It's a mindset - a philosophy. If you walked into a Whataburger at 2:00am, wearing your black belt and traditional karate garb; flashing Steven Seagal style karate chops moves, with the hopes of making sure people in the room recognize your show of intimidation and force, you'd be an absolute embarrassment to your sensei and your dojo. But if you had a black belt and just dressed like a normal everyday human being - and THEN shit went down, there's no way a criminal or no-gooder would even have the faintest clue to your abilities - immediately giving you the advantage of knowledge and stealth.  TL:DR - The person best able to demonstrate their ability to defend one's self and others around them, is the one astute enough to know how best to utilize their resources to their advantage. The most important ammunition in your arsenal isn't in your clip or a chamber in your weapon; it's that spongy material that rests between your ears. Use THAT first - conceal your weapon; maintain your advantage. Otherwise, you're walking around declaring your intentions without saying a word ""I'm here with my weapon exposed (heh heh) because I have trust issues, and I fully anticipate there to be an incident. I could've just concealed this, but I WANT you to know that I fear confrontation, and I erroneously think that by displaying an outward projection of might, you'll cower in fear of me."""
texas,3ch4sa,SycoJack,3,Wed Jul 8 01:31:21 2015 UTC,"Your analogy was good up until the karate chop making a seen stuff. Maybe if you walked in and cleared the room, that'd be an accurate analogy."

He is going to conceal the vast majority of the time.    The guy openly carrying is more likely to discourage the guy wanting to stir shit up than he is to cause problems on his own.  If you were thinking of jacking a what a burger would you choose the one with the redneck toting a 45 long colt?  I bet you'd rather jack the one with no iron in plain view.      Might the open carry guy fly off the handle and shoot someone?  Maybe that happens from time to time .   But he could do that just as easily with a concealed weapon.  Let him sit there and discourage criminals while eating his cheeseburger.  Besides now you you've had a look at him--you are made uneasy by his pistol.  Surely you are getting a good look,  If he does cause a problem you will be able to describe him in detail to the police.    People being made uneasy by open carry is a foul on their own part for lack of thinking things through.  I feel safer seeing an open carry citizen as I know he's suppressing ass hats with hi points who might otherwise try and rob someone.  All while being kept a close eye on by anyone else carrying in the vicinity.  Edit:  I don't think it puts off a vibe of wanting to pick a fight. And if it does, with whom does he want to fight.

Even then, when I see the Open Carry Tarrant guys walking around with their AR-15s on their back I just shrug. The way I see it, a guy with an openly holstered pistol was probably carrying concealed before this law. And I don't worry about someone going nuts and shooting everybody because guess what, an open carry law wasn't going to deter him.  I just think it's much ado about nothing. Virginia has had open carry for ages and it's never been a problem except when some guys go to a Starbucks in Northern Virginia (very urbanized, left-leaning, nothing like rural VA) with openly holstered pistols to rustle jimmies."

And it will be changed by people openly carrying. It's already started to change even now, thanks to the efforts of OCT. There is far less resistance to open carry than before they started their rallies.   Open carry only makes targets out of would-be-heroes, in situations where a firearm is necessary. The only disadvantage of concealed carry is having to wear appropriate clothing.    I don't want to be a hero. I don't carry to protect strangers. I carry to protect myself, my friends, and my family.   People, like me, choose to open carry for the deterrence value. Maybe if someone decides they want to shoot the place up I'd be the first target. But mass shooters are very rare.   And I do fully believe in the deterrent factor of open carry.

The life lesson to be had from this whole scenario is: 1) LEO - Receives intensive training, not only on the physical use of firearms, but proper tactics to prevent from ever having to discharge their weapon. 2) CHL licensees concealing their weapon - while CHL classes do teach you practicality of gun ownership and proper means for diffusion of potential gun play incidents, they are not beholden to an agency/credo/expected means of accordance with said firearm. 3) CHL licensees open carry - same as conceal gun owner, only with even less discretion.  The point of the above 3 options is, a LEO has a far higher standard of obligation to - at all costs - diffuse a situation and PREVENT discharging their firearms, while a citizen does not. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, LEO's have to pretty much account for almost article of ammunition discharged from their firearms, do they not?

A cop isnt looking to be a great shooter as its one of the worst parts of their job; having to get into an actual shooting situation.
texas,3ch4sa,txyesboy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"I can see the point being made from the practical comparison with actual range training (ex. Civilian enjoying range time, racks up hours at range, etc). But conversely, off duty LEO's on average also enjoy range time too. So it's kind of a false equivalency in that regard since its hard to actually gauge and poll the cumulative total ""range hours"" for the average off-duty LEO and the average CHL ""gun enthusiast"" (for lack of a better term, since discharging a firearm isn't a professional skill set for a private citizen, unless their profession has them in the firearms trade itself).  The point I was referring to was more the concrete ""bare minimum requirements"" for a civilian to obtain a CHL and/or open carry vs the bare minimum classroom time/range time for a LEO.  I could put in the bare minimum time at the range - with a VERY loose and easy measurement for what would be considered ""proficient"" at the range (I saw some of my fellow CHL classmate target sheets.....bless their hearts, because BLESSING theirs was far more deadly to a heart than their shooting skills were.)  Point being: I am not trying to be deliberately contrarian for contrarian's sake. I am just trying to play devil's advocate that not ALL civilians with CHL's are either proficient with firearms (and firearm safety for that matter) NOR always enthusiastic about honing their skills at the range. Some merely own a gun for the prestige or the status symbol; and don't respect the responsibility it comes with. Same thing with LEO's too - but theirs is literally their job. And while we ALL see sensational stories in the news all the time about LEO's skirting real punishments for missteps or overreach in their duties, there are still real consequences involved for them re: confrontations involving firearms."

And guess what? It's pretty easy to attain this by, you know, not putting yourself in a position where a LEO would have reason to do so.   I have had a gun drawn on me by civilians; and I didn't particularly enjoy it. Did these civilians have CHL's? You know, I really didn't have the time to ask them before they brandished their weapon and aimed at me. But, unlike those pesky LEO's, who conveniently wore those very obvious uniforms that indicated what they did for a living - giving me the immediate realization that they were, you know, LAW ENFORCEMENT, these folks that aimed at me, well, they didn't really have a standard uniform on.

texas,3ch4sa,Thoguth,6,Wed Jul 8 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"I've never had a police officer or a civilian draw on me. I have buddies who are police, and other buddies who are non-police CHL holders. I've gone shooting with them. The police practice once a year, enough to meet their annual shooting qualification test, because they're doing it for a living. The non-police CHL holders practice for fun, and they're mostly far better shots.   I have had a gun drawn on me by civilians; and I didn't particularly enjoy it. Did these civilians have CHL's? You know, I really didn't have the time to ask them before they brandished their weapon and aimed at me.   They probably didn't have CHL's. To hold a CHL requires training in firearm safety, including explicit instruction in the danger and legal implications of drawing a firearm when not in an actual fearing-for-your-life situation; also a history of bad decision making in the form of a class C misdemeanor, a history of domestic violence or a restraining order against you will disqualify you.  Law enforcement, on the other hand always gets the benefit of the doubt if they shoot someone, and they know it. It's not crazy to think that the CHL-holding citizen is less likely to do something stupid with a gun than the LEO.   So, forgive me for assuming I'd rather take my chances with a LEO than a civilian who goes all 'Murica! and whatnot.

Having a firearm pointed at you dramatically alters your stance on guns in general. I had the luxury of hindsight to clearly assess that the threat was not real - but only with hindsight could I deduce that. At the very moment it occurred, there was literally not enough time to make that kind of decision. So THAT is one of the many additional reasons I am also concerned over the nature of people having such easy access to open carry. Had I been OPEN carry (as opposed to just concealed), it would've been even EASIER to draw on them, given even LESS time to rationally deduce the nature of the situation, and simply fire in that fight or flight moment.   I know that's not a scenario ardently pro-open carry people want to think about and consider the consequences of their actions in that scenario. But, just a simple ""well, if they're going to point a gun at me, they're going to learn a valuable lesson"" won't suffice the guilt you'd feel for the rest of your life, knowing that - in hindsight - these were just kids...DUMB kids making terribly bad choices.....but kids nonetheless."
texas,3ch4sa,WestTechsan,3,Wed Jul 8 04:26:31 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a source on that.
texas,3ch4sa,Thoguth,11,Wed Jul 8 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"There are a few different ways to generate the numbers, since not every state keeps great records of CHL holders and not every police department keeps great records of shootings.  But for one, there are about 1.1 million police officers in the U.S., and about 5 million CHL holders in Texas. Between 2005 and 2011 30 US police officers were convicted of murder or manslaughter for shooting people on the job. Over the period from 1996 to 2011, a period of about 3 times as long, there are 30 murder/manslaughter convictions for Texas CHL holders.  So ... 4 times as many Texas CHL holders, over 3 times as much time, have had the same number of murder and manslaughter convictions as U.S. cops. Roughly speaking that looks like cops are 12 times as likely to murder/manslaughter someone than a Texas CHL holder (which you have to be to legally open carry.)  So, that's one ""source"" for you. Another is found in this Newsweek Article from 1993. I'll quote the relevant bit:   ""Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, using surveys and other data, has determined that armed citizens defend their lives or property with firearms against criminals approximately 1 million times a year. In 98 percent of these instances, the citizen merely brandishes the weapon or fires a warning shot. Only in 2 percent of the cases do citizens actually shoot their assailants. In defending themselves with their firearms, armed citizens kill 2,000 to 3,000 criminals each year, three times the number killed by the police. A nationwide study by Don Kates, the constitutional lawyer and criminologist, found that only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.""   So ... my first source says police are 10-ish times more likely to murder you, and this source says that police are over 5 times as likely to ""oops"" shoot you. Hope that works as a reference."

But sinceUS Police killed more than two people per day so far this year, I agree it's safe to say that's less more than CHL.  If we ignore the fact that Texas is much larger in size and population than almost all other states and divide the overall rate by 50 states.  2 per day * 365 days = 730 per year nationwide    14.6 per state per year  *16 years    234 people killed by Texas police as a very conservative estimate"
texas,3ch4sa,Hovsky,2,Wed Jul 8 02:02:51 2015 UTC,You can absolutely NOT take the number of people killed by police officers and equate or compare it to the number of CHL holders who not just committed MURDER (not homicide) but were also found guilty of it.

texas,3ch4sa,plasticaddict,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:32:27 2015 UTC,I honestly don't understand this trespassing rule.  Is it trespassing when they arbitrarily decide it?  It it trespassing only when a business is closed or private invite only?  Can a manager just say you're trespassing?  Is trespassing essentially the same as refusing service?  How does the police fall into this?  If you're in fact not trespassing can they arrest you for trespassing?
texas,3ch4sa,earthenfield,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"A person who is in control of the property--in this case the manager or employee acting on a manager's behalf--has the right to determine who is allowed on the property. It's ""in public"" but it isn't public property. In this case, you're trespassing once they ask you to leave and you refuse.    Is it trespassing when they arbitrarily decide it?   Sort of. They can ask anyone to leave for any (or no) reason at all. Because it's private property, you don't actually have a right to be there. They do have to ask you to leave or have signage (such as a 30.07 sign), though.   If you're in fact not trespassing can they arrest you for trespassing?   Cops can arrest you for anything they want. Or nothing. Lots of people have been arrested solely for ""resisting arrest."" It might not be legal, but they can still do it.  Remember, you have a right to carry a gun, but you don't have a right to carry a gun anywhere you want.   Then again, concealed is concealed. If someone doesn't want a gun there but you still (for some reason) feel the need to shop there, conceal. They don't need to know."

Holmes said unless the legislature has passed a law explicitly unconstitutional, then the court should defer to the legislature.  Anything else is legislating from the bench.  Is this really what Texas wants?  Who appointed these morons?  This is  judicial thinking that died out 100 years ago.  I would never even assumed it still existed."

texas,3chkug,michaelconfoy,2,Wed Jul 8 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point. Labor laws were determined unconstitutional because under substantive due process they were found to be an unconstitutional violation of the right to contract. Abortion laws were found to be unconstitutional because under substantive due process they were found to be an unconstitutional violation of the right to privacy. Marriage laws were found to be unconstitutional because under substantive due process they were found to be an unconstitutional violation of the right to marriage. Its the exact same doctrine being applied the exact same way, just different justifications and interests involved."

Given there is no right to contract in the Constitution, that legislation must hold.  For abortion, the US Congress did not pass any such legislation.  Various states passed such legislation.  The Constitution is silent on the matter.  It was up to the court to decide whether or not this would be a civil right within the context of the constitution.  Two different things."

Second, just like there is no ""right to contract"" in the Constitution, there is also no ""right to privacy,"" and no ""right to marriage"" in the Constitution either. That's how substantive due process works. Identify a fundamental right that isn't in the Constitution and say that because of substantive due process it overrides legislation.   Point is its the exact same thing, just now applied to things you want instead of things you don't want."

Dagenhart, (and you could have just said that), then that's not remotely similar to the Texas case. The Court in Hammer said Congress lacked the power to pass the law because it wasn't part of their power under the commerce clause, it didn't strike down the law because it found it oppressive. Lochner is way more similar to the Texas case.   But hey lets wrap this up, we both agree the Supreme Court used to pull crap like this back in the day. You think the Supreme Court doesn't use this line of reasoning any more, and I think they absolutely do. Go look at wikipedia, substantive due process was used to justify Lochner and Roe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_States_substantive_due_process_case_law  Read Obergefell: http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf Kennedy is basing it on the same doctrine. Read p. 12-15 of Robert's dissent, he specifically calls him out on it:   The majority acknowledges none of this doctrinal background, and it is easy to see why: Its aggressive application of substantive due process breaks sharply with decades of precedent and returns the Court to the unprincipled approach of Lochner."

texas,3cezwv,synobal,5,Tue Jul 7 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"A couple of things: first, no one is teaching guilt. What they are teaching is assuming responsibility for the fact that there is privilege conferred onto white people, and that privilege has its roots in slavery. Second, no one with any credibility is teaching that ""minorities cannot be racist""; what those folks are saying is that the racism that minorities might put forward doesn't have the same kind of institutional harm to white people as the institutional racism that white people perpetuate and enjoy.

Now, perhaps this automatically means that they don't have any credibility to you, but certainly, many do take this definition seriously.  (I find it to be an insulting thing to say when it's used to shut up a majority group member who says that they experienced discrimination from minority group members (especially when they lived in an area where they were the minority, like a white family living in a mostly black neighborhood), but either way ... that does happen.)

texas,3cezwv,michaelconfoy,3,Tue Jul 7 22:55:43 2015 UTC,"The source of the idea that ""racism = prejudice plus power"" ?  Take your pick.  It's certainly not a definition that everybody agrees on, but it is still somewhat popular.  It's often referred to as ""institutional racism"" when it needs to be distinguished from racism that doesn't involve power, but there's more than a few people who do indeed take the idea of ""racism = prejudice plus power"" to indeed claim that ""black people cannot be racist"" (or that ""women cannot be sexist"".)  Really, the only question left is ""do any of these people have any credibility?"" ... and I'm inclined to think that some do, in spite of or because of this idea.    (And to be clear, this idea ... bothers me.  But I do realize that it exists.  Also, I should mention that the google searches I gave only find one way of phrasing it -- there are others, this is just the most obvious way of saying it.)

I was responding to the claim that '""Second, no one with any credibility is teaching that ""minorities cannot be racist""'.  I quoted that claim to make it clear what I was responding to.  That said, it (the idea that ""racism = prejudice plus power"") is certainly an idea that discussed in sociology, and if (if!) you believe that is the proper definition, it follows that minorities cannot be racist (except in cases like South Africa, where the minority whites have (had?) the power, I guess.)  Either way, I don't have a textbook citation for you, however.  (Textbooks are hard to cite when you don't have it in front of you -- most are not available online without a login.)  But academic discussions of the idea online are easy to find.  (This particular author waffles on the idea.  He admits that ""individual blacks can be and sometimes are racists"", but then says that ""However, collectively, blacks are neither the primary creators nor beneficiaries of the racism that permeates society today."" -- so kind of a middle ground.)

texas,3cezwv,Necoras,18,Wed Jul 8 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"When multiple states made it clear in their declarations of secession  (see below) that the primary reason they were leaving the union in order to continue to be able to own slaves, it's pretty difficult to argue that the primary cause wasn't slavery.  Georgia   The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.   Mississippi   In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course. Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.   South Carolina   The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, on the 26th day of April, A.D., 1852, declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right.   And Texas   Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.    Note that those excerpts (with the exception of Texas) are the opening lines of each State's declaration. I'd think that ""maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time"" makes it pretty damn clear that Texans at the time wanted to own other people in perpetuity and were willing to fight a war over it."
texas,3cezwv,cIi-_-ib,-11,Tue Jul 7 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"makes it pretty damn clear that Texans at the time wanted to own other people in perpetuity and were willing to fight a war over it.   They didn't go to war over it. They seceded. The historically regarded beginning of the civil war was the bombing of Fort Sumter – effectively a military holdout of a (then) foreign nation. That was about separation, not slavery.  Were slavery and abolition movement a big part of the tensions that led to secession? Absolutely. But the idea is being propagated that the North freed the slaves, and the South took exception and declared war – and that's not what happened.  The Union continued the practice of slavery, and even forced conscription of the poor and immigrants to fuel the war machine.  The Union used the Emancipation Proclamation originally as only a  threat to coerce the Confederacy to return (reasoning I still don't understand.)  Then issued it again, claiming to free slaves only in disputed territory that they didn't control – not in the north. That didn't happen until about 6 months after the end of the Civil War.  At best, to say that slavery was the sole, or even primary cause of the Civil War, seems overly simplistic at best. Back to the point, the opinion piece linked by the OP states:   They teach that “sectionalism, states’ rights and slavery” — carefully ordered to stress the first two and shrug off the last...   But then provides no evidence of that claim. It's quite clear to me that there were many causes for secession for the individual states, and slavery was a key part of it – but it was not the sole cause, and the United States in whole, and as remaining Union, was not innocent in any way from its own share of blame for the lives destroyed by both slavery and the Civil War."
texas,3cezwv,150407,7,Tue Jul 7 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"They seceded. The historically regarded beginning of the civil war was the bombing of Fort Sumter – effectively a military holdout of a (then) foreign nation.   Secession is illegal. They were never foreign. They were outlaws- no more foreign than David Koresh in Waco. One man's aggression is another man's tactical response to illegal activity.   But the idea is being propagated that the North freed the slaves, and the South took exception and declared war – and that's not what happened.   I've never heard anyone think this is what happened. As I understand it the wheels were in motion toward general abolition with piecemeal legislation (stopping the trade, forbidding slavery in new territories, and the election of Lincoln). The Confederacy saw the writing on the wall and attempted to sidestep it by illegally seceding. The wheels continued to turn during (emancipation proclamation) and after (13th amendment) the war. Sure the particulars and timing muddies it a bit but the gist- that slavery's days were numbered- is undeniable."
texas,3cezwv,cIi-_-ib,-3,Tue Jul 7 18:08:10 2015 UTC,Secession is illegal.   The idea of secession being illegal was not even introduced until Texas v. White – 8 years after the beginning of the Civil War. Secession was not illegal at the time.  The states had voluntarily joined a union of other states – Texas only 15 years prior. There was nothing legally committing them to an indefinite union.

Slavery was an the primary issue that caused the separation – the war was an issue of the Fed vs. the states' powers (to allow slavery, then, and in the future, knowing that it's future depended on new states in the west being slave states, and thus their congressional representation favoring continuing to allow slavery).   FTFY.   but it was not  a 'Union of abolished slavery' vs. the Confederacy. Slavery remained legal until after the Civil War.   I never suggested that it was, and this is an irrelevant canard used by confederate apologists to try to make the south's cause not look like slavery by way of showing that the north wasn't fighting to directly end slavery (it therefore follows, per this horrid logic, that the opposing south cannot have been fighting for slavery...but that opposing belligerents' causes need be diametrically opposed is not a rule).

That's not what I learned, must have changed in the last 10-15 years.   It's just not true. The union only freed the slaves reluctantly, and primarily only in the South – where they could not enforce it.   You're right, but this is a surface-level way of looking at it, because it wasn't simply a matter of what the legal status of slavery was in the union during the war. Power in Congress hinged on the relative numbers of slave-holding and non-slave-holding states, and the number of states was increasing at the same time that national sentiment was gradually shifting to opposition to slavery -- that process would have resulted in more New states being non-slave, and that in turn would eventually mean reduced congressional power on the part of the slave holding states, which would have meant ripe ground for the abolitionists.    There was way more to the Civil War than slavery. Yes, it was a big part of the tensions, but to teach our kids ""The Civil War was just about slaver"" is an injustice to them, our nation, and the people who fought and died in that war, on both sides.    Welp, it's a good thing this isn't what I'm advocating. I think it's perfectly fine to teach them that Texas' ordinance of secession had a whole sentence or two about lackluster support against natives, but it would be unacceptably inaccurate to suggest that these complaints were on the same level, when the overwhelming majority of the rest of that document talks about slavery, directly and indirectly.   Many in the south didn't even own slaves. Many in the union got conscripted right off the boat from their home country. The war was about power and control.   Wars are almost always the poor fighting for the rich's benefit, this is no exception. The south conscripted blacks to serve as cooks and other assistance to the very men fighting to keep them in chains -- neither practice is commendable, but if you want to compare in terms of degree I feel the south is the worse of the two. All wars are ultimately about power and control, but that doesn't mean we can't judge motives and decide who was in the wrong; plus, that's more a tautology than a counter argument.   Yes, slavery was wrong. Yes, it caused the cessation of the Confederate states. Yes it was a hotbed issue solidifying the division of the industrial and agricultural states. It was not the single driving issue of the war.    It actually pretty much was. The issue of slavery had already threatened nation cohesion multiple times, look up the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas. Tariffs come up in these discussions, but that was hardly as significant an issue as slavery (evidenced by states' documents of secession focus on slavery). Only Texas could complain about the western frontier and defense against natives. ""States' rights"" is another oft-mentioned excuse, but it's belied by the south's insistence that the north enforce the Fugitive Slave Act against their will (a cause which shows up in Texas' ordinance of secession, in fact).  So, what else is there?  edit: corrected to ""else"" above"

texas,3cb1pr,CramPacked,9,Mon Jul 6 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"""Legally innocent"" as a euphemism for ""people awaiting trial""?  That bit of rhetoric makes my head hurt.  ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is an expression, an ideal.  The reality is ... your guilt or innocence of an action is independent of what a court may find and a far more accurate description of the right is a ""presumption of innocence"", which is basically about your right to remain silent and the burden of proof being on the prosecutor to prove your guilt rather than on you to prove your innocence in a court.  Ultimately ... it's likely that the majority of these ""legally innocent"" people are indeed guilty of their crimes, and that many of them will go on to be found guilty by the courts.  Not all, of course, but many.  And many of those who actually committed their crimes will find the charges dropped or will be acquitted by a court due to a lack of evidence -- it's just the way our legal system works.  By trying to make sure truly innocent people aren't convicted, we let a lot of truly guilty people go.  (And yes, I think this is a good thing.)  It's unfortunate that people get stuck in jail before their trial, but either they were just arrested (and so haven't gotten to see the judge yet), they couldn't make bail or the judge decided that they were such a risk that no bail was granted.  And this is why we have a right to a speedy trial, though of course that right is regularly ignored ..."
texas,3cb1pr,dougmc,4,Mon Jul 6 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"The bigger problem here is poor people can't afford bail so they get stuck in jail for months (or even years), while wealthy people are released the same day they are arrested."
texas,3cb1pr,MagicWishMonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  But that's not what I was referring to.  And really, if somebody has to wait years for their trial, they should be simply released due to a violation of the sixth amendment, and many states and the federal government itself have set specific time limits that must be followed.   That said, it seems that Texas hasn't really set much in law, so it's up to your lawyer to push for it -- another place where the poor get screwed, as they're stuck with an overworked public defender who is probably getting paid by the same people that he's trying to get to obey the Constitution.  Ultimately, at every step of the process, our legal system discriminates against the poor.  But that doesn't excuse trying to replace the term ""pre-trial"" with ""legally innocent""."
texas,3cb1pr,dougmc,5,Mon Jul 6 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"I did read the story.  Could you be more clear about what you're getting at?  In general, I don't disagree with the story, and the problems they're highlighting are real and well known.

That said, you threw me some sort of bone, but the word ""drug"" appears 14 times in the article, and none of them seem to say ""no charges were involved"", so I'm still not sure what you're referring to, and I'm tired of re-reading the article.  Are you talking about the ""drug-less drug convictions""?  Even in those cases, they convicted the guy, so he's no longer ""legally innocent"", even if he's ""actually innocent"".  And even if there are a few ""drug charges with no charges"", in the part of my post that you highlighted ...   Ultimately ... it's likely that the majority of these ""legally innocent"" people are indeed guilty of their crimes, and that many of them will go on to be found guilty by the courts.   ... I said ""the majority"".  Not ""all"".  I don't doubt that the police arrest a few people who are truly innocent, and hopefully the system lets them loose quickly (and I'm not so naive to think it always does), but I do still hope that the Harris county cops aren't so incompetent that over half of the people they arrest and book into the jail are actually innocent."

texas,3cbh0n,HappyinAustin,6,Mon Jul 6 20:57:39 2015 UTC,I really can't remember even hearing 75% of the above mentioned (bold and not bold). I went to a decent school district too.  I really would be curious to see how 4 years of high school in the best educational state would be. Looking back some more I can say I learned and retained nothing from high school. All while getting mostly As.
texas,3cbh0n,nomnomnompizza,4,Mon Jul 6 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the school. Keep in mind that ""decent"" school districts, and schools, are usually determined by things like standardized test scores, SAT, graduation rate, and drop out rate. None of those really test student's knowledge of history; out of the four main subjects (English, History/Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science) History/Social Studies (including Government and Economics) is usually considered the least by the school system, at least it appears as so based off testing patterns which heavily lean towards English and Mathematics (shame because Economics is one of my favorite studies).  I've noticed that in schools regarding history teachers individually (or maybe as a ""team"" per school/district) has a lot of power over what is taught; I've heard of teachers, and once experiences, in the same school regarding the same classes having very different approaches, with one barely ever touching the text book and another relying almost entirely on it (keep in mind these are extremes). Anyway, I attended high school in Texas and just graduated about two years ago but I also didn't learn most of the stuff above in my US History class. That said, it wasn't because of our textbooks but rather because I was in AP US History and the class was taught to the test (a nation wide one), which doesn't touch much on most of the above (I took it and got the top number score so I paid attention to the questions).  Oddly, it seemed many times it was the less advanced classes that really learned more in some aspects; while I was making note cards my friends were learning about the Great Migration, contributions of minorities and women, and Marcus Garvey, among others. This said my experience is based off a ""decent"" school in a ""decent"" school district as well in the northern DFW area."

texas,3cay5a,thewaybaseballgo,23,Mon Jul 6 15:15:42 2015 UTC,Apparently Young county is ceasing to issue any marriage licenses.

texas,3cay5a,aceat64,4,Mon Jul 6 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good question. If they don't issue licenses at all, would it still be discriminatory under federal law? Either way, I imagine it probably would not end well for the county/clerk."

texas,3cay5a,moleratical,4,Mon Jul 6 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"but those bans were struck down under the equal protection clause. meaning that banning gay marriage is a violation of the 14th amendment, so the right to gay marry is protected by a constitutional amendment.

I definitely prefer the drive from Austin to College Station over the drive from Houston to College Station.    You are correct about being able to fly directly into Easterwood Airport in College Station, but you might want to check the price differences on your flight.  Flying into Easterwood is really convenient, but it tends to be pretty expensive.    If you do choose to fly into Houston (and rent a car), I'd recommend George Bush Intercontinental over flying into Hobby...that'll at least keep you from having to drive THROUGH Houston.  Here's the Houston to College Station shuttle that /u/AggieDem referred to.  Edit - It appears that there is also a $40 shuttle service between Austin & College Station."

The planes are small, I flew in a prop plane when I did it once. That was fun.   The $40 shuttle is a good idea, since it's 5 or 6 gallons of gas each way anyway and you don't have to hassle with renting a car, which would probably be more expensive then $80 anyway."

texas,3c77ux,IsleCook,93,Sun Jul 5 15:02:06 2015 UTC,"There's the common ground in the abortion debate that I feel rarely gets talked about on the pro-life side: Everyone wants to see the abortion rate go down. Everyone--pro-life and pro-choice. The disagreement is on how this takes place.   But there is common ground between the two sides: Reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. Fewer unwanted pregnancies means fewer abortions. Step up sex education and increase access to birth control. Heck, hand birth control out for free. I'd gladly pay higher taxes if I knew the abortion rate would drop significantly.  The problem is that a good chunk of the pro-life community doesn't want to admit that teens and unmarried people actually have sex. They're afraid that if you teach sex-ed and increase access to birth control, more teens will start having pre-martial sex. And this philosophy is having the opposite effect of what they're trying to accomplishment: it's increasing the number of abortions.  The pro-life community needs to pick which fight it wants: against pre-martial sex or against abortions. They can't win both. Overturning Roe v. Wade is highly unlikely, so fighting to outlaw abortions entirely is a losing fight in the first place. But there is another way to reduce the number of abortions without outlawing abortions altogether. My question is: Why haven't Republicans embraced it?"
texas,3c77ux,iliveintexas,22,Sun Jul 5 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"You've absolutely hit the nail on the head here. I'm pro-life myself, but I don't believe in stopping abortion with law, because if you do it that way then people are still going to get them, only they will do it in less safe ways. Bans on drugs, alcohol, and firearms don't actually prevent people from getting those things, so what makes people think that banning abortions would stop them entirely. If you want to stop abortion, you have to stop unwanted pregnancy. If you want to stop unwanted pregnancy, we desperately need to change our sex education."
texas,3c77ux,Phib1618,28,Mon Jul 6 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"That pretty much sums up how I think about it too.  It's far too common for people who are anti-abortion to also oppose measures designed to lower the rate of teen pregnancy, and instead cling only to abstinence-based sex ed.  They oppose planned parenthood at every turn (even though I'm pretty sure that they do more to reduce the number of abortions than the anti-abortion movement).  They're also most closely associated with the political party actively undermining food stamps and the other forms of support young mothers are often forced to rely on to take care of kids they can't afford.  The message I get from the anti-abortion crowd is that pregnancy is a punishment for sex, not that life must be preserved at all costs.   That's why I refuse to refer to them as ""pro-life""."
texas,3c77ux,monsterbate,5,Sun Jul 5 19:46:32 2015 UTC,I hate the teen pregnancy statistics. They group in legal adults at 18 and 19 and play it off like they are only talking about minors.

They think it's wrong for people to have non-marital sex, and so they want to punish those who do it.  In that fight, laws restricting abortion become tools to punish women for having non-marital sex, and so they don't want to reduce the number of abortions if it means increasing the incidence of non-marital sex.  In other words, they haven't embraced it because they want to—and think they can—win both.  To put you in the Republicans' shoes, I feel that Orwell's definitions of goodsex and sexcrime mirror their mindset pretty well:   His[/her] sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity). SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death.  [...]  He[/she] knew what was meant by GOODSEX— that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.   The Republicans want sex to be performed only by married couples and only for the purpose of producing children, and they want to punish anything other than abstinence that stands in the way of that.  They don't want to punish only some of it, either, but rather all of it."

texas,3c77ux,texancoyote,8,Mon Jul 6 13:23:15 2015 UTC,Another problem with this is that there is a portion of the abstinence only/pro life crowd that firmly believes that any sort of birth control is a sin.  Basically you can have sex after marriage but if you get pregnant from it that's god's will and doing anything at all to effect that outcome is morally wrong.  I dated a girl once that's the oldest of a very large family because of this and is now constantly going behind her parents' backs to preach birth control to her younger siblings.

Remember, Roe v Wade didn't legalize abortion, it made it clear that states actually could limit abortion. They can only limit it, however, when the fetus actually has a likelihood of actually living. Until it does that the living host (mother) is the only one with rights."
texas,3c77ux,Moleculor,-5,Sun Jul 5 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate. By your definition, late term abortions should be illegal. Babies often survive being born at 6+ months and often without long term disabilities."
texas,3c77ux,privatize,19,Sun Jul 5 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"That's not ""devil's advocate"" (though it is a non-standard variant of what 'late-term' means), that's restating what I just said, and it's along the same lines as Roe v Wade. Roe V Wade states quite clearly that states may limit or prevent abortions when the fetus is viable.   50% chance of viability is around the 24 week mark, which falls within the six-month mark.   Many/most of what you describe as 'late term' flat out don't happen. Abortions are things that, for the most part, happen very very early, not when it looks like those fetal pictures you see in anti-abortion ads.   In 2003, only 1.4% of abortions happened at the 21 week mark when the fetus still has no chance of survival on its own, which is a week or two prior to the 6 month mark. Only 1.4%, even when the fetus is still completely non-viable. It goes down further from there.   So no, not ""devil's advocate"".  (""Late-term"" in the context of abortion is currently defined as at the 20 week mark, which is 5 months in, or right around the point when fetal viability stops being a complete and absolute 0%. It still takes a week or two to even push it to the 10% mark.)"
texas,3c77ux,Moleculor,13,Sun Jul 5 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"The topic of abortion falls under bodily autonomy. You can't force a person to donate tissues, organs, or blood to another person even if that person will die. If person x needs blood and person y doesn't want to give it to them then that's person y's legal right. If person a needs a liver and person b isn't an organ donor even though they're  dead that means that person a isn't going to get it, even if that means person a will die.   Making abortion illegal grants pregnant women less rights to their own bodily autonomy than dead people have. If you cared about life at all costs you'd also be for the forced use of organ donations for all dead people, but that isn't something that's ever talked about.   Abortion is only legal before the fetus is viable. When you make abortion illegal you grant dying people less rights than a non viable fetus and pregnant women less rights than dead people. It isn't as cut and dry as pro life people make it out to be. If life was to be protected at all costs we would no longer have bodily autonomy at all."

texas,3c77ux,monsterbate,12,Sun Jul 5 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the old saying, ""abortions should be legal, safe, and rare"".    This anti-abortion legislation doesn't really stop abortions, it just causes hardship and brings back the risk of back-alley procedures.  If people really want to reduce the number of abortions they should be investing as much effort into the things that are proven to reduce them, not attacking the procedure itself.   Too many times I've seen the same pro-life people also push an anti-education, anti-contraception, abstinence only agenda.  That's not going to reduce abortions."

texas,3c9rvv,deagle12,5,Mon Jul 6 05:22:04 2015 UTC,"Grew up in the neighboring town (Denison). It's an okay area. Cost of living is incredibly cheap and if you're really looking to settle you can get a veritable mansion for the price of a two bedroom in Dallas. You get a nice compromise of rural north Texas feel while still having access to chain-style shopping and dining.   I will say that the nightlife is non-existent unless you're a fan of dive bars or honkytonk clubs, but that is pretty standard for small towns. If you are looking for entertainment, you're only an hour and a half away from Denton or Dallas. If gambling is your thing, the Choctaw Casino in Durant is only 45 minutes north.   It's also a nice location if you like outdoor activities, with Lake Texoma and Ray Roberts both close by.  CableOne is a terrible service provider. I left the area about two years ago, but they had me on a plan with 50gb data cap and would charge me per gig if I went over. My bill tended to run about double its quoted rate just from watching Netflix. They did give me ""free hours"" during late night, which is when I would try to schedule all my large downloads. These kind of antiquated rates are ridiculous though and only possible due to their monopoly over the area. That said, though, I never experienced any major outages other than issues with the cheap router they leased to me. Once I replaced it with my own the problems disappeared. I would recommend checking with Verizon as last I heard they were providing FiOS to certain areas of Sherman."

The thing is that house doesn't look higher than 2 in terms of where the road comes down to it. It's just that it is built up on a hill that it cuts into the corridor.  So unless it's about actual height in terms of terrain as well and not just how high a building can be, then it seems unlikely he wouldn't be allowed to build a home on his lot."

texas,3c45kg,losthiker68,7,Sat Jul 4 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"You want to do a nice rub on your brisket.  I use a mix of chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, paprika, brown sugar, red pepper and coriander.   Do a nice coat over the entire brisket while messaging the meat.  I usually apply it the night before.  I smoke my brisket over a mix mesquite and apple wood.  I try to keep the temp between 225 and 250.  I smoke it for atleast 1.5 hrs per pound.  After that, I let it rest for another 30 minutes before i cut it against the grain.  As for the sauce... I cant help you, we tend to not use sauce.  I've never made any."

texas,3c45kg,jdcooktx,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"Good Gawd Man. Just go to a real good barbecue joint and buy it. Here's Texas Monthly's latest list.  Barbecuing a brisket, is not fixin' a recipe - it's an art; it's a science. People spend years becoming pitmasters; they take seminars, and study books; they spend hours and mess up hundreds of pounds of meat, and most of them still never really manage the manna that is great barbecue. Not every Texan expects to get there, and if you think you've barbecued burgers, you have further to go than most (that's called grilling). And good barbecue doesn't really need any sauce.  If you still want to try at home, you will probably need something bigger than the grill you have. Then build a wood (oak, mesquite, pecan...) fire on one end; when it's hot and making coals and good smoke, but a brisket on the other end that's been rubbed with a little salt, black peppers, and a bit of some other spices. You can wrap it in foil for the first part if you want. Wait ten to sixteen hours, but constantly check the temperature, you want them low."

texas,3c45kg,STG210,3,Mon Jul 6 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"You'll need the right tools for the job.   Get an offset firebox smoker. You'll be able to ask one of the fine folks at your nearest Academy Sports to help with selection. Invest in a thermometer when you buy your smoker. This will help during smokes - temperature control is important.   Buy your brisket. When starting out, you'll make some mistakes in managing your smoker. It's totally OK and learning is part of the fun. An untrimmed brisket will be more forgiving.   Prep the night before. I make my own rub with a heavy amount of Kosher salt - and I cut that with cumin and chile powder. If I'm pressed for time, I use straight Tony Chachere's seasoning. Generously coat the brisket the night before and place it in the fridge. Sitting overnight like that will allow the rub to stick to the meat and you'll be rewarded with a juicier final product.   Fire up the smoker in the morning. I cheat and initially use match light charcoal to get things started. Add the wood and get your temp to about 220. Place your brisket on the smoker and maintain heat until done. Smoke times will vary based on (a) the size of the brisket and (b) how well you're able to regulate the heat.   Good luck and have fun!"
texas,3c45kg,kosmickoyote,2,Sun Jul 5 13:34:00 2015 UTC,For a brisket it's too late today. It takes hours to cook and you have to manage the heat. Those burgers are grilled. You most likely don't have right equipment meaning a grill large enough (fire at one end and brisket at the other). It is something you start the day before. Also decent BBQ requires no sauce unless your trying to hide something.

I recommend for the unsure beginner getting a Masterbuilt electric smoker with a electric gauge that regulates temperature and time. Then you can add wood chips in the built in tray for smoking.  (http://www.amazon.com/Masterbuilt-20070910-30-Inch-Electric-Controller/dp/B00104WRCY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436160064&sr=8-2&keywords=electric+smokers+masterbuilt)  Once you get the basics then you can progress and get a combo wood fire smoker/grill and cook with direct and indirect heat. I use my grill/smoker, but in the beginning I used the electric and my brisket, sausages, chickens, and fish came out perfect. I don't do pork or shellfish now though because of my gout.  By the way you don't need soy in recipes. I'm married to a Japanese and soy sauce aka shoyu as they call it, is basically high in salt/sodium and fermented soybean for flavoring their cooking. They use shoyu for a lot of BBQ out here in Hawaii to make the sauce more to Asian/Pacific islander tastes.  Now i would teach you how to do an Imu, but you need to find lots of volcanic rock smooth down over decades of water erosion in river banks lest they blow up from the heat."

""Bidness"", ""Elbow grease"" and ""Plug nickel"" are a few phrases that have stuck with me from my dad's dad.    A ""business"" was any established company.  ""Bidness"" was anything to do with personal finance or somebody else's family problems.    ""Elbow grease"" is just what it sounds like, and I'm sure you know the phrase.  Lean into it, put some real effort into it, put some stank on it!    As a child I was repeatedly told by my granddad that I ""wasn't worth a plug nickel.""  Back then the phrase made no sense to me so it didn't hurt my feelings, but knowing now that it means a low-value coin that was made worthless by punching a hole through it and filling it with cheap metal kind of makes me want to reevaluate my relationship with him."

My wife (25) and I (26) meet in college and both got jobs with the University. We have fallen in love with the town.  Weather wise: Hot, Humid, Rainy(recently). Depending on where you grew up will depend on how much adjusting it takes. This summer has been very mild so far because we are getting so much rain.   If you like to do something, I am sure we have it somewhere.  College Station has a fairly large foreign population due to the University but the population is still mainly white.  If you would like to PM me feel free."

texas,3bxa7i,emeraldrumm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:27:14 2015 UTC,There are plenty of non-aggies in town. As long as you aren't an ass to Aggies about being Aggies then there won't be any issues even then there won't be any major issues. Just show some respect and you will get respect back.  There is a large difference between heat hot and humid hot. It will just take some adjusting and you should be fine. Most say it is worse but this is a good summer for you to get used to it since its a mild summer.

texas,3bxa7i,sniffing_accountant,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:30:29 2015 UTC,Coming from Phoenix. I'm sure it'll take some adjusting. Only real thing I'm worried about I guess is finding things to do and meeting new people being a non-Aggie.

Make sure your landlord (or yourself if you're buying) sprays for bugs frequently as the giant roaches and giant black beetles are evil.  Socially college station shuts down during academic breaks as it is entirely a college town. Bryan does better as less of its population is students. Most social events that aren't driven by the school will occur in Bryan.
texas,3bxa7i,juco818,2,Mon Jul 6 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"Just moved here a year ago from Montana, and honestly I can't stand it and I am planning to move as soon as I can. For one thing, there is nothing to do here. I'm sure part of the reason I feel that way is because I grew up in the mountains with the whole world at my fingertips, but I've spent a lot of time in San Antonio and Austin and there's plenty to do there, just not here.   There's just restaurants and stuff going on on campus, which is cool but as a recent grad as well (class of 2014) I am tired of the college scene and don't want to spend all my time around undergrads. What makes matters worse is that as an outsider, it's harder to make friends here if you're not an Aggie. They're nice and everything, but there is so much of an insider culture that if you aren't on campus at all and don't participate in all the traditions, it's hard to stay connected with people.   The weather is not great either. Very hot and humid, but I guess depending on where you're moving from you might not mind that as much. Definitely more humid than other Texas cities though.   Honestly I love Texas, but I'm not a huge fan of College Station. There are some redeeming qualities (lower crime, shorter commutes, etc) but if I were you I'd definitely move to a town that doesn't revolve around the university."
texas,3bxa7i,superspeck,2,Sat Jul 4 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"This is sort of what I'm scared of. I don't really mind being in a college town, but like you I don't go there, I don't have any strong feelings for A&M one way or the other. I'm sort of ready to move on from college life as well, so thank god it's pretty central to the big cities. A pretty crucial edit I made above is that it's a temporary project for 12 - 18 months, so worst case I don't spend a ton of time there. I'm moving from Phoenix, AZ so the heat isn't a big deal but the humidity will take some getting used to."

L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself .[133] Crockett went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quote attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state.

If you have a plan on how to 100% secure the border then great please let congress know!  But let's run the scenario of our governments best effort on increased border control. Let's say they successfully keep out all families, single men looking for work, and those who will not willing/able to go through other dangerous methods of crossing the border.  They keep out 90% of immigrants. Yay!  But the murder rate doesn't go down or only goes down an insignificant amount. Well it turns out that most of the murders are committed by drug dealers, people who were murders elsewhere, thieves, and other criminals. They were not deterred by the new efforts to block immigration, they went to other dangerous or illegal means of crossing the border.   It sounds nice in theory that if increase security at border and increase laws to discourage immigration that we would prevent murders and other crimes committed by that group. But in realistic practice, less people come over but no less crimes committed because we are talking about criminals. If they are willing to murder they are willing to go through extremes to cross border and live in the US. Does that mean we shouldn't try anyway to increase security and make stricter laws as an effort? No it can't hurt to try, but I am fairly sure it won't get the results that you are looking for."

Note how it doesn't limit the protections for clergy/ministers to their duties while working for a religious organization.  It seems to provide those protections 100% of the time.  Now assume that some justice of the peace or other government official responsible for handing out marriage licenses also happens to be an ordained minister.  Bam. You are now supposedly 'protected' by Texas state law from having to 'violate' your religious 'rights', even in the course of doing your duty as a government official.   I don't think such an interpretation would eventually hold up in legal challenges, but I could see a person dragging something like this through multiple levels of the court system for years. People are very emotionally invested in the idea of the government not dictating what religious figures do, and even if that 'religious figurehood' is bought with $10 online, it can be spun in the right way to appear serious. Especially if it's not an online ordainment."

Bam. You are now supposedly 'protected' by Texas state law from having to 'violate' your religious 'rights', even in the course of doing your duty as a government official. I don't think such an interpretation would eventually hold up in legal challenges   You're right, it would not hold up to legal challenges. You cannot, as a government official, refrain from your constitutional duties on the basis of religion. A clerk who refuses to issue a marriage license will not be sued in that regard. The government will. And the government would lose.  On a separate point, I believe this law is unconstitutional because it is overbroad. Here is text, emphasis is mine:   RIGHTS OF CERTAIN RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. A     religious organization, an organization supervised or controlled     by or in connection with a religious organization, an individual     employed by a religious organization while acting in the scope of     that employment, or a clergy or minister may not be required to     solemnize any marriage or provide services, accommodations,     facilities, goods, or privileges for a purpose related to the     solemnization, formation, or celebration of any marriage if the     action would cause the organization or individual to violate a     sincerely held religious belief.   As the ""official"" analysis stated,  ""This language could provide cover for secular or commercial entities to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity."" This opposition was written prior to Obergefell's passage. In light of its passage and how same-sex marriage is now a fundamental right protected by the due process and equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, that language appears to allow commercial entities to discriminate based on their religious beliefs. If, for example, Marriott refused to host a same-sex wedding reception on the basis of ""violating a sincerely held religious belief,"" their refusal would be unconstitutional under Obergefell.  One final note. Many here have already pointed out that it was indeed pointless to say Pastors don't have to marry gay couples. They already had that right as was pointed out in oral argument of Obergefell. No gay couple (or straight couple) would try to coerce a clergy member who was opposed; instead, same-sex ""couples likely would want to be married by clergy members who embraced their unions."""

Maybe I have that wrong though...   I don't believe a County Clerk can perform a wedding, they just issue the license.  There's actually a question as to whether or not a Judge can refuse to conduct a gay marriage. There was an AG Opinion in the 80's that if a Judge performs weddings for one type of couple, they can't refuse another. After that Opinion, the Legislature passed a law that Judges cannot discriminate due to race, religion, or national origin. Obviously, gay marriage wasn't even on the radar then. But it's not a leap to apply it here. Basically, a Judge can do all marriages, or not do any. But they can't pick and choose."

Serious: it looks like went in through the open window and managed to push on the window button (probably by supporting himself there, not thinking about the button), closing the window on himself, trapping himself.  This actually kills a number of people, especially kids, when they get their necks caught in there -- the windows can close with a lot of force, and once it happens you often can't reach the button any more, and that assumes that you have the presence of mind to actually do so.  This guy doesn't look to be in real danger, especially since he was probably seconds away from rescue, but certainly, it doesn't look like he could have gotten himself out of that unless he could break the window.  (Which is a lot easier to do when it's not completely closed.)"

But not only that, but the complaints of oppression on the part of the Mexican government toward the Texians are just as amusing. The Mexican government jumped through hoops for the Texians, including tolerating squatting for a while, tolerating the Texians lack of interest in assimilating into Mexican culture and even making English the official second language of the country."
texas,3bmpv1,rednoise,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:21:23 2015 UTC,There's a difference in an illegal immigrant and settlers that were paying taxes without representation to a government that wouldn't provide protection for them.

When Santa Anna came into his power, the Mexican government restricted the flow of immigration from the United States, and it introduced new restrictions on the immigrants that were in Texas. They had to register with the government and follow a set of guidelines. Many Texian colonists didn't. They squatted the land. They were illegal immigrants, pure and simple. All colonists were also ""temporarily free of any kind of tax."" When the Mexican government got fed up with the flagrant violations of its law, it further restricted immigration -- which, in response, the Anglo settlers attacked government bases. Source for all of it. It's interesting what they don't teach in school, isn't it?  By the way, illegal immigrants today pay taxes. Property taxes, through paying rents; sales taxes, just by the mere act of buying stuff, and an increased number have been paying income taxes, as well. That smells like taxation without representation, too."

The lower court will have to issue a court order, as they must follow precedent set by the supreme court.

texas,3bmltt,YourOnlyVato,-5,Tue Jun 30 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"Useless? I mean, I guess if she's had years of poor performance reviews. She doesn't want to take on a new responsibility imposed on her after she accepted employment for a given job with enumerated duties. And the reason rests on her constitutionally protected freedom of religion. It sounds like this is a problem the county needs to rectify by accommodation rather than discriminatory termination.  Again though I'll just remark on all this fuss over confirmed thoughtcrime. We are all entitled to our beliefs, especially in cases where there is no evidence of anyone being even mildly inconvenienced."

Yeah job duties change, it happens. In the private sector, the solution here would be termination. I see no reason to treat this differently just because she is in the public sector and claiming religion as an excuse."
texas,3bmltt,TheRighteousTyrant,5,Tue Jun 30 18:44:46 2015 UTC,Also you never responded to this:   Imagine a pig farmer is seeking to incorporate his farm. The clerk with whom he attempts to file his incorporation documents refuses to accept them in the basis that the clerk is a Muslim and their religion forbids the consumption of pork products.  Should the Muslim be reprimanded (up to and including termination) for this unwillingness to do their job?
texas,3bmltt,YourOnlyVato,-6,Tue Jun 30 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"Act 1 - Imagine a Muslim clerk was hired to process rural agribusiness incorporation documents. There are no pig farms anywhere such that he would ever be asked to process any related documentation related to pig farms. In fact, there's no record of anyone farming pigs in his state ever. He's happy to take the job. He likes dairy farms and chickens. Pretty much everyone he knows feels exactly the same.  Act 2 - In the midst of employed bliss, a change is afoot in a distant land. Suddenly pig farms are all anyone wants to talk about although at most pig farmers make up 2-5% of the population. Given the opportunity to speak publicly on the matter, he says, ""welp, I don't do pig farms. I want nothing to do with them. They are distasteful to me and my God. I can say that, right? This is still America, isn't it?""  Act 3 - Pig farmers learn of this lowly clerk's comments and come at him hard. None of them live anywhere near him, but the very idea that someone would disagree with their way of life works them into a frothy rage.   ""You will incorporate my pig farm, or we will drive you from your means to support yourself.""   ""But can't we just have someone else do it?""   ""NO! Diversity of opinion will not be tolerated! Take your silly religious hang ups elsewhere back to Pakistan or wherever you came from!""  Act 4 - To be continued..."

texas,3bmltt,leostotch,5,Tue Jun 30 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"I think this would fall under reasonable accommodation that allows for free expression of religion while still getting the job done.   Perhaps.  Time will tell - I'm not necessarily against the idea, but at the same time in principle I am of the opinion that anyone acting as the government should leave all of their personal preferences - religion, etc. - at the door when they are performing their duties.   Somewhat predictably the call for tolerance ends once they gain the upper hand.   ""Tolerate my intolerance!""  This doesn't seem like a valid argument to make.  Again, this woman has openly stated her refusal to fulfill her duties.  I don't think it's unreasonable to call for her to be removed from the role if she is unwilling to do the job."

Could that be accommodated somehow, or does she deserve to lose her job? What would that be other than religious discrimination? This ruling didn't change the First Amendment.  Nobody should check their conscience at the door when performing their government duties. That's how people get tortured and Afghan wedding parties get droned."
texas,3bmltt,leostotch,5,Tue Jun 30 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"She didn't change. The law did. Suppose it was instead that the Supreme Court declared all county clerks had to work on Sunday and this woman said she could not for reasons of conscience. Could that be accommodated somehow, or does she deserve to lose her job? What would that be other than religious discrimination?   Sometimes laws change.  If she's unable or unwilling to perform the job due to her religion, then she shouldn't have the job - that's not a violation of the First Amendment in any way.  Would a Jew or Muslim who keeps kosher/halal be allowed to deny business licenses to business because they serve pork or shellfish?  Of course not.  Is it religious discrimination to expect an agent of the government to issue licenses in accordance with the law, regardless of their personal preference?  Again, the answer is plainly no.    This ruling didn't change the First Amendment.   The First Amendment does not allow anyone to enforce their religious views on anyone else; attempting to enforce a biblical view of marriage by picking and choosing to whom she will give a marriage license would, in my mind, actually be more of a violation of the FA, as she is attempting to use her government position to give preference to one religion over others.   Nobody should check their conscience at the door when performing their government duties. That's how people get tortured and Afghan wedding parties get droned.   First, I object to drawing an equivalency between waterboarding suspected terrorists and providing marriage licenses to those who are qualified for them.  That's a pretty cheap trick to play, and doesn't do anything to support your position.    Second, if a government (or any other) employee has a serious conscientious objection to the duties they are asked to perform, they should absolutely not be doing that job.  I don't think that's an unreasonable stance to take."

texas,3bmltt,YourOnlyVato,0,Wed Jul 1 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's not complicated. If you think same sex marriage is counter to natural law and evil, and so many people do, then it would be wrong of you to participate in it and a violation of conscience to force you to. Selling paperwork by itself is pretty benign in most circumstances, but in this case it is the paperwork that makes the same sex marriage happen, again, which you recognise as evil. It would be similar if you were a stick dealer and someone came in looking for a stick with which to beat his wife. If wife beating is fine, you sell the stick. Another happy customer. If you think wife beating is evil, what kind of act is it to sell him the stick knowing full well what he intends to do with it? You would be facilitating his wife beating. Theologically, you would be an accessory to evil.  This thread is dead, and I almost didn't respond, but maybe that makes sense even if you don't have any problem with same sex marriage.

texas,3bjouf,omapuppet,3,Mon Jun 29 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you can say that, but it doesn't change the fact that, without voting, you won't make a difference at all.  The fact is that for some people, the stated goals (i.e. party platform) of a given party may align very well with their own societal priorities and preferences. When I was younger, this wasn't the case with me, but as I've gotten older I find myself in much closer alignment with the democratic platform in the US.  This isn't everyone (for either party), but it's definitely some people.   Circling back to your question, it's absolutely a fact that any given organization seeks to preserve and protect itself as much if not more than anything else, and parties are no exception. But to succeed, they do have to accomplish some of their goals, so figuring out which one is more likely to do something you actually agree with is still worthwhile even if they're all craven weasels only doing things to make you like them (and they aren't).  At this particular moment in US electoral history, we have a situation where one party -- the GOP --  has, hilariously, basically defined themselves as ""NOT THE OTHER ONE"" on any point, even when you'd think they'd be able to agree, no matter what (e.g., even when the health care bill proffered by the Dems came out of a Republican gubernatorial administration and a right-wing thinktank).  That same party seems also content to strap themselves to the good ship Bigotry & Homophobia, which -- given that they're also virulently anti-immigrant AND dominated by older voters -- is a fucking AWESOME strategy for demographic irrelevance within a cycle or three. This isn't actually good news for anybody, because they'll drag discourse down during their spiral. I'd much prefer an actually SANE conservative party, but I'm not sure any of those people still exist, at least in the US.  As a consequence, where I live, I'm very comfortable voting a straight Democratic ticket nearly every time. It's absolutely the most rational choice for me, given my level of agreement with the Democratic platform, and my extreme disagreement with the stated Republican platform. I did this even when I lived in Sheila Jackson Lee's district, because however much I dislike her (and it's a lot) she'll vote in the House the same way I'd vote far, far more often than any hypothetical Republican would, regardless of whatever other bullshit she does."

Perhaps that's not what you were saying, but it's how it's interpreted by everybody else, and it's how it works out in practice.  If you want to avoid that, vote for your preferred candidate.

We'll even make underage rape victims pay child support if they're male.  I have no problem with abortion except that it's sometimes necessary.  I wish there was never a need for an abortion.  But the fact that women will fight for those protections while completely ignoring the fact that men don't get them, while using sexist arguments to justify denying them to men, is getting disgusting.  You'd think that whether or not the father wants the baby would be a factor in the decision to abort.  Instead, the father gets no choice and we call that equality."

Sure, but unless it's actually happened, I don't think it's really a good thing to spread around. One of the big reasons men don't get more vasectomies is because of the reversibility issue. If it is easily reversible, then it'd be a tick up on yet another reason to just get one. My wife and I have resolved to adopt when we're ready to have kids, so that wasn't an issue for us, but there are issues and misconceptions that scare other guys away from it.  One of the biggest I've heard -- unrelated to this -- is that it's often mistaken with castration. And there's an attendant feeling, even when you know that it isn't true, how it affects ""manhood"" and all that other crap. I went through this for a couple of months after the operation, which was bolstered by hearing some woman on the radio warning men off of vasectomies because, to her, it represented basically being castrated.  Hate to make it all about men, especially considering topic, but in this particular instance, there's a lot of work to be done to assuage men into considering it as an option. Simply listing a litany of good reasons -- and good ones, they are -- over trying to convince their girlfriends or wives to get hormone-fucking pills and hysterectomies, isn't good enough, unfortunately. Wish it was!"

Those aren't great odds, especially since vasectomies are had for long-term reasons, more often than not. For the pain and money of getting a reversal, it's better to just get a sperm extraction. Less intimate, but there's greater odds of success.  Also, I wonder how much abuse your junk can take, before you start having serious issues, if you decide to get another vasectomy after reversal."

Abstinence teaching in schools, increased privatization of public works, school ""home rule,"" backdoor abortion bans, rhetoric against immigrants while turning a blind eye to massive willful employment of illegals by corporations ... None of that bullshit is good for Texas.

(A certain fracking law ban comes to mind ...)  The Republicans don't give a flying fuck that they're doing all this bad stuff, and they stay in power by transparently playing on the social fears of our majority rural, under-educated, small town electorate and the Reagan-trained ""religious right"" in the cities. They hate Texas, and make no mistake, somewhere there's a room full of Republicans in Connecticut laughing at us every day as they count on our votes.  They're terrible people, the people who keep voting for them should feel deep shame, but they don't; They live in various states of willful ignorance mixed with the bemused detachment of whatever level of wealth they possess.

It's been the opposite; we've ruled this country, molded it, and created the laws making our beliefs the law of the land. Now that the pendulum has begun a dynamic switch to a liberal society that doesn't want religion around (which if we are being fair, it isn't uncommon for more liberal societies in history to do away with religions) the older generation of Christians have started screaming that this is what persecution is.

As science progresses we just cast off the archaic fictitious storyteller explanations we used to have for the world around us.  Christianity and other religions are on the retreat. In Europe you are considered a moron if you still believe in Christ, God and what all not. Religion in Europe is associated with lack of education and poverty.  I must say, I find the US a bit behind in that respect, but it's good the US is finally catching up.  US Christians also have very little knowledge of the bible and history in general sense. This lack of historical knowledge keeps the faith strong.   I'm an atheist, but I'd wager I know more about the church than most Christians in the US.  Also the founding fathers were extremely liberal for their time."

You do what you believe you need to do, and follow the two rules."" Really changed my perspective on life after that.

texas,3birzs,Danuwa,-16,Mon Jun 29 21:47:47 2015 UTC,The Muslim issue and driving is not in the Koran. The Catholic person could go find a different priest that will marry them. The other two are easy. Go find someone else willing to do it. What I'm getting at is you can't force somebody to do something they don't want to do. Period! Personally I wouldn't marry them. I also do not have a problem with gay people as a whole. I just don't believe they should be married under the eyes of God. I won't treat them less than any other person.
texas,3birzs,JonnyRingo03,9,Mon Jun 29 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"State workers who issue marriage licenses are not acting as clergymen.  A catholic priest who doesn't want to marry a divorced person in his church has always had the right to refuse to perform the ceremony.  But if you take a job as a county clerk or justice of the peace, the ONLY legal reason you should be allowed to not issue a license is because the couple is not legally qualified to marry.    You mention the Koran not saying anything about driving, but that is really beside the point, isn't it?  If you allow state workers to pick and choose based on their religious beliefs, you open a can of worms on what that worker believes in his or her faith, not what YOU think the Koran, Bible, or any other holy text actually says.    If a person can't do the job of treating all people equally under the law, they have no business working as an agent for the secular government.  It seems pretty simple to me.    We are talking about state workers,  not priests."
texas,3birzs,MJG2007,-9,Mon Jun 29 19:53:09 2015 UTC,All I am saying is go find someone else to do it. Do not force someone to do something they don't believe in. You WILL find someone else willing to do it.

texas,3birzs,JonnyRingo03,6,Mon Jun 29 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works.  State workers are paid by tax dollars.  If they feel they cannot perform the duties of their job as required of an agent of the State, they have a choice: find another job.  I take a very hard line on this.  If you are unable to issue a marriage license based on anything other than the law, you are unable to perform your duty and it should never be up to a couple getting married to have to shop around for a county clerk who is willing to do their job.   Again, we are talking about state workers.  Not clergy.  If Pastor Jim Bob decides he won't marry someone in his church that is fine and dandy (and always has been).  If a couple walks into a county clerk office to get a marriage license, the clerk needs to be a professional and do treat all citizens equally regardless of their personal feelings and as citizens, we have a right to expect that from people acting in the capacity as a government official."

This is just an example, and I don't know if permits are required in some cases for a pig roast.

texas,3birzs,HDRed,3,Tue Jun 30 06:30:24 2015 UTC,I do not support the idea that a state worker can refuse a legal license for any reason. And I don't understand fracking enough to talk about. I could spit out some bull that I read on the internet but I wouldn't know if I was right or not.

texas,3bjdol,jordanmc,3,Mon Jun 29 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"The Eight Amendment and the death penalty have co-existed alongside each other for over two centuries. Plenty of states have banned the death penalty democratically, and they are certainly within their rights to do so; I don't think its far fetched to envision a future where every state has banned the death penalty. But Justices shouldn't pretend like they've discovered a new meaning to the Constitution just so they can enact their preferences on those people who disagree."
texas,3bjdol,tonictuna,2,Mon Jun 29 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"Well, that's how it works. Times change. Public opinion changes. One could have used your argument because slavery existed for X number of years, or the denial of women to vote."
texas,3bjdol,jordanmc,0,Mon Jun 29 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yes but when slavery changed we democratically passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendment.  When women got the right to vote, we passed the 19th amendment. Nowadays we don't bother passing amendments we just let judicial oligarchs tell us the meaning of the Constitution has changed."
texas,3bjdol,150407,0,Mon Jun 29 21:13:04 2015 UTC,"The Eight Amendment and the death penalty have co-existed alongside each other for over two centuries.   Your logical fallacy is appeal to authority. That those live together isn't proof of anything besides that being a growing paradox. As times evolve, so too does the perception of cruel and unusual and the longevity of the death penalty alongside the 8th amendment doesn't matter. If/When the SCOTUS strikes down the death penalty they will certainly have the 8th amendment to stand on and the paradox will evaporate."
texas,3bjdol,jordanmc,0,Tue Jun 30 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"What authority am I appealing to? The authors of the Constitution and the dozens of Supreme Court justices over a span of 200+ years that saw no conflict between the Eight Amendment and capital punishment? You do know that appealing to authority is exactly how Constitutional law works right? This idea that the law changes as our perceptions change throws out the whole basis of constitutional government. Rather than having a document which we know the meaning of, we are now at the whim of whoever is ""perceiving"" the document. When you want the Constitution to change, change the Constitution...its called an amendment."
texas,3bjdol,150407,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"You say that if a paradox (legal death penalty despite 8th amendment) lives to 200 years then it's validated. You're appealing to logic that somehow 200 wrongs make a right. They can stand on the 8th amendment to kill the death penalty and it's not hand-waving, it's correcting a longstanding and growing contradiction.   Unless you write the constitution like code then it absolutely is always subject to interpretation which is why the SCOTUS exists. ""Cruel and unusual"" are not mathematical statements, they are subjective. As we become more enlightened to what is cruel (inherent racism, failure rate, botched executions) then the reasoning to ban it on those grounds becomes more viable. No new amendments required."
texas,3bjdol,HappyinAustin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"Do you think the fact that the 5th amendment refers to ""capital"" crimes implies the constitutionality of the death penalty? I think it must, right?"

Unless you want to go waaay north to Fort Worth, which is a great city as well.  Georgetown/Round Rock is somewhere I would live if I ever moved back to the Austin area. They are basically the suburbs of Austin(moreso Round Rock I guess). I would never live in the heart of Austin again, but it's great to be within 30min of the city with everything there is to do there.   The job market in the Georgetown/Round Rock area is decent, depending on your chosen career... Don't try to look for a job in Austin, however, if you are thinking about commuting. Assuming you'd be working a typical 9-5 or whatever, your drive to and from Austin every day would be an utter nightmare of traffic, and possibly give you a mental breakdown as it did me lol.   As far as housing and apartments go... It'd be cheaper to rent an apartment if it's just you and your boyfriend. A house COULD be cheaper if you had roommates... but apartment is my preference anyways just because I don't want to deal with the upkeep and extra pains that come with renting a house.

texas,3bk1ka,ravyrn,-1,Tue Jun 30 09:11:25 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Texas since the early 90's and still hate it. Why I stay is because it has a strong economy, plenty of jobs, and low cost of living.   I lived in corpus twice, Euless, Lewisville, Flower Mound, Corinth, and finally Denton.   My biggest dislike about Texas are the people, the bad ones seem to be in larger quantity and louder than in other parts of the country which seems to have been reinforced by the Texas machismo attitude that permeates into much of the culture here.   Racial division is finally starting to fade away, but is still very strong and visible between each racial demographic with the exception of immigrants from across the Atlantic or Pacific. The most frustrating part of the racism is the apparent ignorance of it, it isn't a kind of hatred as much as a it is discrimination.   Christian evangelical values are pushed on everyone and you'll be looked at funny if you don't go to church on Sunday and god forbid you admit to being an atheist.   Basically, if you want to make it here socially you'll have to either assimilate or not have that big of a social life.   Political views will be very different to what you may have experienced in Maine, for example many of my coworkers are not happy about gay marriage being made legal, a couple genuinely believe that Obama is the worst thing to happen to America and he plans to take all the guns before he leaves office, and many think Bush and LBJ were great. This is just where I work which tends to attract the more moderate crowd.   The natural beauty of Texas is there but it's not very accessible. I live in a city that I think has a larger population than Maine's largest city, and everything takes forever to get to. Want to go to best buy? That will take at least 20 minutes. Not that big a deal right? Well add in 100 heat on top of everyone's car pumping out more heat because they're all running they're AC while sitting at a light. Make sure you have a car, Texas isn't pedestrian friendly. This is a self-fulfilling situation: everything is too far away to walk, so sidewalks not really a priority, it is usually too hot to walk, so everyone has a car...  Texas heat is nothing to write off. It will drain your soul just as quickly as it drains your energy, like you'll leave work, get in your hot car and have zero energy when you get home. Expect your first few summer to be long and miserable. Expect that you and your significant other will have many fights and arguments over nothing because the heat makes people tired, irritable, and crazy.  Many on reddit enjoy music venues for entertainment, but if you aren't a big music fan and don't enjoy sitting and stuffing your face at restaurants, then you're gonna have a bad time. Like the great outdoors? Not with 90 degree sun baking on ya with 86% humidity after driving an hour. Our forest aren't like what you find up there in Acadia or the Adirondack, our forest are usually littered with mazes of briar patches and thorny vines waiting to snag you at each step. Now east Texas has some nice tall forest, but the thorn bushes are there all the same. If you've been to any other beach then you'll never visit the Gulf Coast.   Anyways I could go on, but I won't since I'm sure some Texas tattooed redditors have got their jimmies rustled, so let me leave you with this, Texas has a great economy and low cost of living, which translates to jobs and more money in your wallet, which you can use to temporarily escape more frequently than someone making the same money in another state. Also, Texas' conservative attitude creates an culture that is very self-reliant and do-it-yourself, which isn't as prevalent in other states I've lived in."

I've found Austin to be the most likeable city in Texas and the people there seem to be more open minded than in other Texas cities.  DISCLAIMER - what I am about to say certainly does not apply to everyone in Texas  However, I moved to Houston 2 years ago from Florida and still ask myself why everyday. People here are very different than what I am used to. Especially in Houston, but also throughout Texas, there is an attitude of ""fuck you, I do what I want"" (i.e. - don't mess with Texas). Many Texans drive large trucks extremely erratically and will run you off the road while flipping you the bird while others dump trash and animals on the side of the road because hey, you can't tell them what to do. This results in littered highways and dead/abused/dying animals accompanying your commute home. I have experienced an incredible amount of disrespect for the environment and fellow citizens in my time here. I've been cursed out at the dog park because a man thought I took his parking space (I didn't) and most recently someone side-swiped my new car without leaving as much as note. Be prepared to get a very thick skin if you wish to live in this state.   As stated, this is certainly not everyone in Texas - I have met many nice, amicable people in my time here but the assholes really stand out because there are just so many of them. You really can't avoid them. I've traveled extensively around the US and the world and I have never experienced a place with so many rude, loud, inconsiderate people.   Another issue that I have with Texas is the natural surroundings. I find myself missing the natural beauty of Florida as there are very few state parks, lakes, etc. that compare to the type of landscapes seen along the east coast."

texas,3bg1es,jdcooktx,-17,Mon Jun 29 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of questions that are asked in seriousness.  Marriage is a Christian/biblical establishment.  Marriage is not required for two people to live together, love each other, be physically intimate with each or raise families.    Why then are people who do not care what the bible has to say by virtue of their lifestyle (homosexuality is forbidden by the bible) making a quest of redefining something that the bible has defined (which seems extremely contrary to the complimentary quest of separation of church and state)?  I would think that if the bible definition of sexuality means nothing, a biblical definition of marital union shouldn't either."
texas,3bg1es,timdogcc,11,Mon Jun 29 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"Marriage is a Christian/biblical establishment   No it's not.   Today many Christian denominations regard marriage as a sacrament, a sacred institution, or a covenant,[209] but this wasn't the case before marriage was officially recognized as a sacrament at the 1184 Council of Verona.[210][211] Before then, no specific ritual was prescribed for celebrating a marriage: ""Marriage vows did not have to be exchanged in a church, nor was a priest's presence required.   Marriage is a declaration that consenting adults wish to spend their lives together. It's a contract between two people. There is nothing inherently Christian or religious about marriage.  Edit: On top of which I'm sure that people were getting married before Jesus was born, so the assertion that marriage is a Christian ""establishment"" is completely farcical."
texas,3bg1es,strugglz,-3,Mon Jun 29 14:32:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for the link.  It was an interesting and quite lengthy read.  The problem with the Wiki article is that is mentions multiple times over that there is a difference in a civil union and a religious wedding ceremony (you can have one without the other).  My question is intended (though until reading the wiki article I didn't realize I needed to separate the two) for a faith based definition of marriage.  My question still stands with regards to the media and rights groups that are pushing for religious organizations to change their definition of marriage and to perform ceremonies when it clearly violates what those churches stand for.  Law has been amended to allow for civil unions/ civil marriages. Same-sex couples can marry and achieve any legal benefit associated with it.  Why then push for churches to change their beliefs?  And then take it a step further to threaten to remove tax benefits for adhering to those foundational beliefs (refusing to perform a ceremony for a same-sex couple)?
texas,3bg1es,timdogcc,2,Mon Jun 29 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"Law has been amended to allow for civil unions/ civil marriages.   I don't believe law has been amended, it has been clarified to apply to all persons, regardless of sexuality. I personally haven't seen anything from a group directly involved with the gay marriage movement suggesting that religious institutions should lose their tax exempt status. Look at it this way, the same part of the country throwing a fit about gay people getting married is the same part of the country that threw a fit about mixed race marriages, saying that it goes against their religion. In both cases religion is being used as a shelter to discriminate (or hate or bigotry or whatever else anyone wants to call it). Now those instances may or may not be related, but the coincidence calls it into question.   adhering to those foundational beliefs (refusing to perform a ceremony for a same-sex couple)   I wouldn't call that a foundational belief. There is nothing in the New Testament about homosexuality, but there is in the Old Testament. For some Christians to place emphasis on laws from the ""old covenant"" and ignore the ""new covenant"" is a rejection of that covenant and a demonstration of what they think it's worth; nothing."
texas,3bg1es,strugglz,8,Mon Jun 29 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"homosexuality is forbidden by the bible   As is wearing articles of clothing made of two types of cloth at the same time.  And eating pork.  When a man dies, the Bible also requires his brother to marry (and potentially rape) his late brother's wife.   Both these Biblical ""laws"" are in the same book (Leviticus) as the prohibition against homosexuality.  Why do we get to pick and choose which of these we will follow?"

texas,3bfda2,rednoise,2,Mon Jun 29 01:17:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's not necessarily a bad thing but this could apply to literally any teacher or child, not just spec ed. They could be hiring more teachers for the spec ed department to have more accountability and eyes on the kids with that kind of money, or many other departments that need funding in whatever ways.

I have a child with limited language and we've had to deal with suspicious bruising in the past, as well as a very wonderful-on-the-face teacher who is now in jail for sexually assaulting three children (not his students, but the same age range). I wish it was a funded mandate, believe me, but I welcome the addition of cameras.   Also, I don't think that hiring more teachers would increase accountability, but it would be freaking awesome if they would staff according to pupulation needs, something that this wave of government has made impossible. My kid went without a teacher almost the whole year becasue his injured herself and eventually quit; but while she was hemming and hawing about coming back the district refused to hire even a long-term sub. Madly frustrating and you can't go to due process over personnel issues, and the way the state complaint system works we wouldn't have been able to force anything until after the year ended."

No one could care less what the churches do on their own land. They have the right to refuse it, because they cannot issue a license for marriage. They only marry people under their god, and that is their right. The licenses granted by the state are issued by a judge in a courtroom, not a priest in a church.

texas,3b72te,nonbornking,3,Sat Jun 27 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that because the government takes in a portion of the bakery's profits, the government should also be able to tell the owner how to run his/her business? Why should the government get that and their quarterly pound of flesh?  A private business can't, and shouldn't be beholden to the government's will because they also get the ""privilege"" of paying taxes.  If the bakery was being operated by the government sure, but not a private business."
texas,3b72te,saltporksuit,3,Sat Jun 27 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"It's the privilege of enjoying the facilities those taxes provide. Like we all pay towards through taxes.

texas,3b72te,sonorousAssailant,2,Sat Jun 27 05:56:52 2015 UTC,I don't see how taxes are relevant. A church still gets access to what the taxes provide. It just doesn't pay anything.
texas,3b72te,Thunder_god1987,7,Sat Jun 27 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"Never said it shouldn't. I feel a business should be able to practice what it wants, just so long as those practices are harmless. If a business wishes to deny a customer based on bigotry, then so be it. If it is a big of a social issue as it is, then that could easily bankrupt them, and run them out of business. Or people could not care, and the business can stay open. In the end that should be up to a place of business."
texas,3b72te,Moleculor,6,Sat Jun 27 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  What constitutes harmless? Is a grocery store denying access to a group 'harmless', or does it result in people starving? What if it's the only one in town? What if it's the only one grandma can get to? What if there are twenty in town? Six? Where's the line?  Does having to spend more on gas (or buy a car, get insurance, etc) count as 'harm' if they have to drive to the next town over to buy food?  What if you replace grocery store with internet company?   What if it's a swimming pool? What if swimming is medically necessary to keep one specific person healthy? Do we start requiring people to gain individual governmental protections in certain cases, such as medical needs?  What if all the businesses all adopt a highly discriminatory practice, and no one cares? Do we then have a subset of the population that then have to resort to criminal behavior in order to survive?  Did you know that tipping is a highly discriminatory practice, and in most restaurants in the USA we pay waiters below minimum wage, resulting in old black guys earning far less than young pretty white women? And no one (or very few) care?  Yet there's no 'social upheaval' calling for the removal of tipping in America.  Also, all business exists at the whim/behest of the government, and as a result of the government granting them the right to exist as a business/corporation, that company and its owners enjoy special protections (bankruptcy will hit the company, not the owner, for example) that aren't afforded to Jane who sells her jewelry out of the back of her car?  Why should the government be granting and approving of businesses that actively work against the benefit of society as a whole? What do the people get out of a business that harms society in some fashion?   If we're going to continue to grant businesses with the protections they enjoy for being a business and providing a service to large communities, they have to provide that service to everyone in order to benefit the most people. Space is limited, land is premium, and competition is fierce. If a business wants to discriminate, there are other people willing to run the same business without discrimination, but can't start up until the one enjoying governmental approval goes out of business, and that's harder to do when the government approves of your business."
texas,3b72te,Aaron215,2,Sat Jun 27 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"Previous Supreme Court positions that relate include Palmer v Thompson, a case about not being able to restrict access of swimming pools to certain people so they closed all but one and sold that last one to a private party, and Brown v Board of Education, a case about not being able to restrict access of a school to certain people, so they closed it. Brown v BoE is pretty cut and dried: the state did it to prevent integration, and it was an institution required to provide services.  In Palmer v Thompson, the pools in the city were closed (they cited public safety) and they sold one to the local YMCA which kept it open but for whites only (it was private at that point, and the only publicly available pool in the area). The Court's main concern was that the pools were closed specifically to keep from integrating, and they said:   ...petitioners' contention that equal protection requirements were violated because the pool-closing decision was motivated by anti-integration considerations, must also fail since courts will not invalidate legislation based solely on asserted illicit motivation by the enacting legislative body.   If I'm reading that right, it says that the Court didn't have solid proof that it was done specifically to prevent black access to pools. But in that case, discrimination based on race falls under that protected class rule. If a local business denied access to people because they were homosexual, that is currently okay because they are not a federally protected class. If there's a local or state regulation that says they are, then businesses would have to comply with that regulation.  I think that's all correct, but I'm no lawyer. As far as I know, a grocery has every right to deny services if local law doesn't prevent it, but they're gonna get a lot of bad publicity (and some good publicity from those who support them). Remember that pizza place? They got bad and good press, about 1 million in donations, closed for 8 days and reopened better than ever. Worth it."
texas,3b72te,Thunder_god1987,0,Sat Jun 27 04:10:19 2015 UTC,"We're talking about a bakery here, and large supermarket stores are very liberal in practice. They don't discriminate on any of those things for both their customers, and employees. The main businesses we're talking about are small time businesses that their owners should have the final say in how their business is run.  The business is providing the service not the public, and they have the right to refuse service to anyone. That is their right, and they are not required to give a reason. People vote with their wallets, and if no one likes what the business is practicing eventually said business will go bankrupt, and another more wise business owner can fill in the gap.   You can't spout freedom of speech, and then tell someone ""well it doesn't matter what you think, you must serve this person. End of discussion"". That isn't right, because that takes away the rights of the business owner. It's their business, and he/she should be allowed to run it as they feel so long as they don't bring physical harm to someone.   Examples of harmful business practices I feel are wrong. A restaurant serving contaminated foods due to poor store hygiene. A retail outlet selling ""as is"" known bad products that are bootlegs of popular functioning products. ect. Not stuff like a bakery saying ""I refuse to make a cake meant for a gay wedding"". That is a social issue, and should be handled by the public not the government."

texas,3b72te,PrincessLeah80,6,Sat Jun 27 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"There was truly a general idea among GOP members of the Texas Leg that ministers, churches, etc. would be 'forced' to marry same-sex couples.  Otherwise, they never would have passed a bill preventing just that when it was an already protected right to refuse such a thing.  But yes, the arguments used by opponents should stick to the idea that states define marriage, instead of using religion and religious liberty as a base. The problem is, even when they use the state's definition argument, they bring religion into the definition of how marriage should be recognized. A lot of political leaders are blurring the line of what exactly they're opposing when it comes to marriage equality in their statements. Overall, it's a ridiculous attempt at preventing something that was inevitable.  Edit: If you ask me, it seems to be only about religious liberty, according to our Attorney General"

This is about the courts issuing marriage licenses to gay couples so they can receive the same benefits that strait married couples enjoy. The church can't stop the court, so you have zero say if a gay couple can get married.  Hate gays, and deny them the right to services in your church all you want. We don't care, and neither do they. However, you do not have the final say, because a church doesn't issue a marriage license. They marry the couple under their god, a sort of invisible marriage license the United States doesn't recognize, and no one outside of the church even cares about."
texas,3b72te,Thunder_god1987,-26,Fri Jun 26 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"We're on the same page, I know churches wouldn't be forced to marry gays (separation of church and state) and this was about marriage licenses for benefits...essentially.  And I totally disagree with it.    Marriage to me is nothing but sacred and between a man and woman.   Therefore, the church DOES have final say.  The Gov't is not God. I'm not sure if you mean ""you"" as a general term or meaning me specifically.  I do not hate anyone, nor do I have to endorse anyone.  Am I going to stop it? Of course not."
texas,3b72te,SpacedAlien,13,Fri Jun 26 21:25:46 2015 UTC,"Apologies, from your wording it made me think you believed that the church was the one issuing the marriage license.   It's perfectly fine for you to believe in that, and no one is ever going to take away your beliefs. To me they should be allowed equal rights because the church is not, and never will be the governing entity of this country. Church, and state should remain separate because you have the right to believe whatever you wish. No one will ever take that away from you, but it is not right for you to trample on the rights of others with your beliefs. That is what this is about.   Just because you don't agree with something that harms no one, doesn't mean you get to put your boot on their head to hold them down. I personally believe in no god, because I see zero evidence of there ever being a god. Yet, I have nothing against Christianity itself, it's only Christians that feel they're entitled to stomp on the rights of others that I have issues with.   This is a constitutional issue with the government, and providing equal rights to it's citizens. You can dislike gays, refuse to marry them inside your church, and go about your day as normal. Nothing will change in your day to day life. So don't get your knickers in a knot over something that will not affect you."

Its just as unfair to the rest of us to make us have to abide by your concept of faith when you set yourself up as a gatekeeper to the public and then choose to go against the public laws to serve your faith. In this regard all county and state officials that dont feel that they can fulfill their duties because of their faith need to resign from public service. The county clerk does the bidding of the state, not the lord. If thats not a rule they can abide by they need to go."

I dont have a problem with a bakery not wanting to make a gay cake or any sort of cake that offends their sensibilities. But when it comes to equal rights under the eyes of the law, thats not just some public lip service I pay to fairness. If it applies for one of us it applies for all of us.

In the end, the only people who give two shits about GODs blessing on their marriage and being married in a church or in the eyes of the lord are religious people.  Maybe there are some gay people who would like their marriage to be recognized by the church they attend, but if a church finds their union horrifying I can guarantee you that the majority of gay people are not going to want to be married there anyway.  so feel safe young Christian, NO one is going to come and force your church to marry gay couples.

Also, technically, you don't own money, it's owned by the state anyway, you simply bear it and use it for transactions.

It didn't start becoming really commonplace until the late 90's - early 2000's. The closer you got to Louisiana, the more likely you were to see it.

Unless you're prepared to mount an argument that the vast majority of polling done anywhere, on any issue, is bad, then you're going down the wrong path here. If you're freaking out about 1200 out of 13 million potential voters, on a state-wide poll, then what do you do about things like Presidential polls, where most polls sample size barely breaks 1000? Shit your pants?  1200 is a representative sample when it's weighted correctly, and if you look at the methodology, the way they weighted and matched the dataset is fine. I would go back to whomever gave you those applied statistics classes and demand your money back. You got shorted."
texas,3b3wn0,rednoise,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:44:00 2015 UTC,"No I just don't trust political or sociological polling in the first place. It coincides too highly with agendas being pushed by the pollsters in most cases regardless of it comes from academia or some ""independent"" polling center.  EDIT: Also, if you want particulars I've done biostatistics as well as metocean forecast/hindcasting courses in school. I haven't had a chance to use them much at at work, unfortunately, but from what I remember about biostats a sample size of <0.01% of the population (1200 out of 13 million is actually 0.0092%) cannot reliably be extrapolated to the entire population even with ""weighting factors"".  There's only so much room to use a weighting factor before its use succumbs to personal bias or having jumped to conclusions ahead of the data.   This study combines the worst of population studies (ludicrously small percentage of population) and applies that conclusion to the remainder of the populace as if it was designing something needed a tremendous safety factor. So...yes, this is really bad statistics and no, I've got my money's worth (and then some) from my degree, thank you."

Not to say I think an actual federal invasion is anything close to likely in the near or even somewhat near future. But it does go to show that there is life outside of reddit, Salon, and HuffPo. It's very easy to lose sight of this when you cloister yourself in an echo chamber of ""progressives"" but it's still true.  This may be the ""Texas"" subreddit, but it's still on reddit.

Still, I am yet to meet a conservative who would be willing to have a rational discussion on various policies and their actual effects without boiling it down to beliefs or emotions.  I do know such people exist and frankly, I'd like to meet them.  This however, is nothing close to being conservative.  This is a disturbing example of paranoia.

Seguin - Hmm...what's Seguin known for? I've only been there once. You're near San Antonio. It's got that going for it.  Without knowing what kind of area you want to live in and what you're interested in, it's pretty tough to suggest one place over the other. Those are four different cities in four different parts of the state, each which their own pluses and minuses, depending on what you want in a city."

If you prefer living in a more urbanized area, but not necessarily  in the middle of the city, then you might like Arlington. Even though it is a suburb, Arlington is the largest city in the United States that doesn't have a public transit system. Although there are some areas that are more on the impoverished side, as there are in any city, the city as a whole is well off. I live in a sparse suburb that is full of small farms full of horses, cattle, and Longhorns, alongside huge mansions for the well-to-do. It's right in the middle of the DFW area, so you're never far from anything you might need or want. Just my two-cents. There are better places to live, but when it comes to Texas I highly recommend North Texas, if nothing else than the weather."

Huntsville is rowdy, but close to the parks and wildlife. Sam Houston State University  and Sam Houston State Park are right there. Also, a very tall statue of Sam Houston is on the main road right outside of town. Drove through Seguin a few times. Very nice, quiet town from the places I shopped or bought gas. You kind of need to keep in mind that none of these is more then 3-4 hours from the others, so they are all pretty accessible. Arlington is beautiful and a nice suburb. The only reason I don't recommend Dallas-Fort Worth right now is the string of media sensations coming from that area. Tons of unnecessary traffic around the city for the last few weeks.

It was one of the few places as kids that we could freely go to when we wanted to grab a few drinks in the dead heat of summer.  Buc-ees sure was different back then, and the clean bathroom concept wasn't even in their blood.  It was just another plain ol' convenience store (with a TDECU ATM later on. TDECU has blown up in its own right.)  We did have the original mega Buc-ees concept built at the Surfside location, but I was surprised to see it catch on so well across Texas.

Yes, people buy and proudly wear the logo of this gas station. Imagine someone wearing a Stripes or Texaco T-shirt or sporting a Raceway sticker on their bumper. Proudly.  However, there's no denying their beer prices are excellent. $7.50 for Stella Artois six pack that goes for $9.50-$10.99 at every other gas station. So, I stop every time on my by-weekly road trip."
texas,3b0evd,Castr0l,6,Thu Jun 25 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think its just the allure of a giant gas station in texas. Everything is bigger and texas and boy are we proud of it. Not only that, as a texas company thats only in texas it gives people the right to brag about it. I honestly didnt understand it either until I went in one and walked out with what shouldve been about 50 bucks for fresh beef jerky (only spending maybe 20 bucks, and it was fuckinf delicious), was met with smiling faces and kind employees (very hard to come by at gas stations) I drive cars for a living and stopping at gas stations can be time consuming when theyre busy or understaffed. Buc-ees was always busy when I stopped, but never understaffed nor did I see some teenager who was getting under paid not giving a fuck about their job. Its a little bit like HEB, or blue bell. Its a texas thing."

In both Jewish and then, later, Christian theologies, killing has always been recognized as legitimate in self-defense and in executions.  Hell, the very same scriptures that gave us ""thou shalt not kill"" also gave us a ton of offenses for which you could receive capital punishment like gay sex, cursing your parents, adultery, etc.  So let's not delude ourselves by applying ""thou shalt not kill"" to capital punishment.

Pending:  7/16/15 Clifton Williams   On July 9, 2005 in Smith County, Williams entered into the residence of  93 year old Cecelia Schneider, stabbed, beat and strangled her, and burned her body. Williams then stole her purse and car and fled the scene.   8/12/15 Daniel Lopez   The subject was resisting arrest and got into an altercation with the victim. The subject fled the scene in a motor vehicle with officer in pursuit. Officers were attempting to set up a spike strip and the subject struck the victim,  Lt. Stuart Alexander, causing his death.   8/26/15 Bernardo Tercero   On 3/31/1997, Tercero and one co-defendant entered the Park Avenue Cleaners and shot and killed an adult male, Robert Keith Berger, in the presence of his 3 year old daughter. An unknown amount of cash was taken from the business and Tercero and his co-defendant fled the scene. Tercero further fled to Florida, while his co-defendant fled to Mexico.   9/2/15 Joe Garza   Convicted in the December 31, 1998 choking death of a 71-year-old preacher Silbiano Rangel. Garza and the victim were in the victim's vehicle when Garza choked him to death with a rope and took his vehicle and money. Garza then dumped the victim's body on the street and fled the scene.   10/6/15 Juan Garcia   9/17/1998 during the night in Houston, Garcia and three co-defendants approached Hugo Solano who was walking to his vehicle in the parking lot of an apartment complex. Garcia demanded the victim's money and then shot him in the head with a .25 caliber pistol, killing him. Garcia took $8 in cash from the victim.   10/14/15    Licho Escamilla   On 11/25/2001, in Dallas, Escamilla was engaged in a fight in the parking lot of a nightclub. When Dallas City police officers arrived to stop the fight, Escamilla shot Christopher K. James two times. The officer died en-route to the hospital.

The triple murderer Todd Willingham refused to go back into his house and rescue his three little girls inside. This was during the early stages of the arson before flames were even visible. His neighbors were pleading with him to go back inside and let them out but he refused. Does this sound like the actions of an innocent man?  The killer Willingham even took the time to move the family car and BBQ pit away from the house as his little girls were burning to death inside. Do those sound like the actions of an innocent man?  The murderer Todd Willingham was seen cutting up, laughing and playing music as he was cleaning up his murder scene before he was arrested. Does that sound like the actions of an innocent man? It would seem he would be in mourning over the loss all of his children.  A witness testified he was more upset his precious dart board was destroyed in the arson rather than his own flesh and blood. Does that sound like the actions of an innocent man?  I see you insist on taking the OPINIONS of some booksmart arson ""experts"" who were in The Innocence Project's pocket over the actual fire investigation done by a man with over 250 actual arson investigations. He was actually there. They weren't.   Oh, and yes, the prosecutor should have told the defense the jailhouse snitch was getting special treatment.

More Republicans wanting to take hard earned money from Texas taxpayers to turn into welfare coupons to dole out to other poor Republicans looking for government handouts to send their kids to religious schools on my dime.  No thanks. If you want money for religious private school, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and pay your own private school tuition. It's called personal responsibility and is the lynchpin of small government. When some ~95% of Texas children attend public school, it would be prudent to appoint a chair that has actual experience administering such a system instead of appointing this well-to-do dipshit who homeschoolled her kids and sent them to private school.  If anyone wants to point out that public schools already operate this way, consider the hypocrisy involved in crying about government schools out of one side of their mouths while creating an entirely similar form of tax-and-spend big government welfare education system that puts my money in the pockets of religious school administrators instead. This is nothing more than a power play for Republicans who want to use government money to subsidize religious private school institutions."

texas,3b0on9,professorbooty25,15,Thu Jun 25 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Are they using the same logic that has marijuana legal in some states despite what the fed says?   If the feds wanted to, they could make marijuana related arrests in Colorado and Washington on federal charges, and the state law in those states doesn't mean shit. I suspect this doesn't happen since it's waste of resources, would be politically unpopular, and a US Attorney prosecuting the case runs the risk of getting a very sympathetic jury. In that case, you can have a state law that is contradictory to federal law, and the state can get away with it since the feds have pretty much chosen to look the other way.  Gay marriage and the cases that are being heard on it, and here's the big difference, is a Constitutional issue. Does the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment guarantee that same-sex marriages. As Article VI of the Constitution states, it is the ""supreme law of the land."" A state cannot enforce laws that violate the US Constitution, even if the state law says otherwise."
texas,3b0on9,TamalesAreBueno,5,Thu Jun 25 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"you can have a state law that is contradictory to federal law, and the state can get away with it since the feds have pretty much chosen to look the other way   The White House has basically told the feds to stop enforcing the minor marijuana violations and to concentrate only on the more severe things -- things that are probably still illegal in the states that have legalized marijuana.  In general, the feds did not enforce minor marijuana violations, ever (possibly with a a few exceptions) -- they left that to the states.  But this recent push to leave the states alone is a brand new thing -- 2013 -- and came because the marijuana legalization movement is hitting a point where the feds can't ignore it.  But previously, they would indeed still enforce their laws.  I recall reports of them raiding medical marijuana vendors in California, for example, even though it was legal by California law."
texas,3b0on9,dougmc,-12,Thu Jun 25 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"The 14th is so broad, can it not be applied to recreational drug use as well as same sex marriage? The point I'm trying to make doesn't involve the laws enforced on a federal level. I'm talking local government not following federal law."

But if you can make the argument, I'd be interested in reading it.   The point I'm trying to make doesn't involve the laws enforced on a federal level. I'm talking local government not following federal law.   If you're trying to make the point that a County Clerk doesn't have to issue a marriage license to a gay couple because people in Colorado can legally smoke weed under state law, well, that doesn't make much sense. If that's not your point, I have no idea what your point is.  And really, if Ms. Sands had just said ""We will not open early, we will wait to hear from the AG's office before doing anything,"" she probably would have been fine. But if you're going be a county clerk and make comments that show you don't understand civics 101, like this, “I will do it, but it’s my understanding (the Supreme Court) ruling has no bearing on the counties in Texas,"" it just makes you and the state look bad."

texas,3b0on9,PorkyBodine,7,Thu Jun 25 21:32:32 2015 UTC,States that have made marijuana legal have not challenged the Feds right to enforce the Federal law.

We fucked off 90% of the time, did ""demonstrations"" to ""lure in customers"" another 5%, and actually sold stuff the rest. You can go hours without seeing a single customer and then get that one guy who drops nearly a thousand bucks for his party.   However, it is highly recommended that you camp on site, or find someone who will. Those things are easy to break in to and people definitely will try."

texas,3ayk4j,TexasCoder,8,Thu Jun 25 00:19:57 2015 UTC,"I managed 2 stands for 5 years for a non-profit group. Your question makes it sound like someone else is managing the stand so this may not fully apply. We gave up our stands last year. After running the rough cost/profit numbers every year we were only making ~$3-7 per man hour for 11 days of hard long hours. I'd rather just write a check for a fund raiser and enjoy the 4th with friends and family.   There are a few things you need to keep in mind:   It is a lot of work - you unload the truck that brings the product to your stand, organize it on the shelves, take care of your own trash/boxes, clean the stand then return any unsold product. It is a lot of liability - One of you will need to be on site at all times. Literally 24/7. The fireworks in that stand are your property. If they get stolen or destroyed you still have to pay the fireworks distributor their money. You also need to be set up with a separate bank account for the stand deposits. Most distributors will rent you credit card machines now but you will still have a lot of cash. Some nights you will leave for the bank with over 10k in cash... If you do your nightly deposits into a personal account it gets tricky come tax season. You don't want to show the gross 120-140k as income just the 10-15k the stand actually earns. It is a lot of sitting - you will get bored manning the stand from noon - 6pm. Bring something to do and some way to stay cool. We had a lot of mario cart and beer. It takes some knowledge and salesmanship - Study the distributors price sheet so you know what products actually cost the stand. Don't be afraid to bundle slow movers with popular stuff just make sure your profit margins stay intact. You will be given dozens of cases of artillery shells - bundle the crap out of them. It will be a good year - Given that Texas is saturated with rain right now it will likely be a booming year. I don't know of any active burn/fireworks bans.    Go for it and see of you like it. It should be a great year for a 10% cut."

We are going to have to have someone run to the bank every night with that much money? Damn.   Also, I thought we would make around 25,000 - 30,000 making each of us 1250 - 1500.

texas,3ayk4j,durbblurb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"That 120-140k was just the rough estimate for what the 2 stands we ran may take in this year(combined). No idea what your market will be like. Out of that you pay sales tax, the distributor and any expenses/employees.   My work force was all volunteer based - either donating their time or working off dues/fees. I never worked out how a stand would operate paying/splitting the profits.   Let us know what you hear in the meeting. You have 3 great sales nights this year since Friday is the bank holiday. The nights of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th are going to be busy.  Also nail down how you reorder product from alamo.

Are running the stand or just working for someone? Stands usually make a lot of money in a short time (huge markups). There are rules and regulations that you have to mindful of. When I was a kid, they'd give me like $300-500 for like a week of part time work. I probably popped $200-300 of fireworks. Plus I was a kid in a small town working a dream job. In Houston area, that wouldn't be much money. $1500 sounds reasonable.  More importantly, light the fireworks so you understand them and can sell them. I hate when I ask what they do and the salesman reads the label ""emits flaming balls."" Also, give free punks with purchases.   All-in-all, what do you have to lose?"

Of course we're getting ripped off, but if my friend and I can walk away with 1k each and 500-750 being paid to friends we would be okay with this.

Marriage should be a sacred thing defined by the church or the individuals involved, as it had been for thousands of years.

I thought I'd get an article about right-wing policies that will be detrimental in the long run to our economy and social structure. Instead, I got an article showing that Texas is only really just barely growing, since most of the population increase has been due to natural causes? I assume that means births from families already living here?   The article then goes on to compare Houston to Chicago, and the demographer confidently has predicted that Houston will soon become the 3rd most populous city in the U.S.  He says older economies grow slower than newer ones, which is a totally reasonable thought. What he fails to mention, is that both Houston and Chicago were incorporated in 1837. Chicago didn't have some 100 year head start and just ""peaked too early"".   Other than Houston will eventually be the 3rd most populated city in the U.S. soon, I didn't really see a point to the article, or the headline."

texas,3ayhol,RootHouston,-1,Wed Jun 24 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"The law hits minorities and poor people particularly hard.

So, they decided to make it harder for people with certain traits to vote, traits that are disproportionately found among poor and minority voters. Among these traits are:   Not having a birth certificate (due to being born to a midwife or not having proper filings) Having no drivers licence. Not having a concealed carry licence. Not having the money for the birth certification fee.   These traits are not inherently racial, but they are statistically more prevalent among certain groups.

Yes, there are statistically more poor white people than there are poor minorities.   C'mon, the important number here is that a greater percentage of minorities are poor than the percentage of white people that are poor in Texas. This means that the aspects of the law that add voting restrictions on poor people hit minorities hardest.  The point here is that the law uses a non-existent problem to implement new rules that make it harder for some people to vote, a disproportionate percentage of whom are minorities. That is what is being claimed and that is a fact.  EDIT: no response? Why are you so set on having a voter ID law that solves a non-problem?

Around 600,000 registered Texas voters don’t have one of the limited forms of ID that the law allows, according to evidence presented in the legal challenge to the law, which was brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department. The state did almost nothing to challenge that assessment. That means there’s no doubt whatsoever that the law disenfranchised legitimate voters.  There is also no serious doubt that the number of disenfranchised voters exceeds the amount of fraudulent votes the law stopped. Texas has been able to point to just two fraudulent votes since 2000 that would have been prevented by the ID law.   http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-many-voters-were-disenfranchised-texass-id-law  Also,  You should have to document a name change to vote? I thought voting was a right? If there was a reason for the law, I might understand. But two fraudulent votes since 2000? That's a garbage justification for making it harder for 600,000 to vote.

I could easily say ""600,000 eligible drivers don't have drivers licenses."" Same thing. Go get a license.  It's not the law, it's the individuals.  And, yes, you have to document your name change to vote! Just like you have to document it at the bank, with your employer, with your insurance companies, on your credit cards, at the library, with the Post Office, on your ID...  Cry me a river."
texas,3ayhol,RootHouston,0,Wed Jun 24 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"It is rarely 100% impossible to get these IDs, but it is harder than it should be. First of all, you are not allowed to use a regular birth certificate for the ID (which would be reasonable.) Rather, you need a special ""voter identification purposes"" birth certificate that can only be acquired by physically going to the DPS office. (Normal birth certificates, for all the purposes you just listed, can be mailed, but not this one. I wonder why!)  So, while voting is a right, unlike banking, library cards, or the post office, it is harder to acquire the necessary identification to vote than to use any of those other things.   Furthermore, I'm not someone who thinks that everything should be handed to you. If it's slightly inconvenient to vote but it gives some reasonable benefit, that's fine. Obviously the benefits can outweigh the cost. But in this situation, there are zero benefits, and a real costs. Voter fraud is demonstrably not an issue, so it is wrong to restrict people's voting ability to combat it."
texas,3ayhol,RootHouston,-3,Wed Jun 24 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"All very well said.  The space between ""harder than it should be"" and ""impossible"" is where our minds might meet.  I think the 600,000 is a number inflated by activists. The methodology would be interesting.  But I do think that this will make a lot of people—mostly poor and brown—unable to vote. And that will suppress Democratic votes. And I think that is the intent of the law."
texas,3ayhol,RootHouston,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take a lot of people being kept out of the polls to make the law wrong, since it doesn't solve a real problem. (Voter fraud is negligible in any election, at least in Texas.)  It will indeed suppress the Democratic vote, but that's not why I dislike it. If the Democrats where suppressing the Republican vote, it would be just as bad to me.   (I wish I could post more often, but I have to wait 7 minutes between comments due to all the downvotes.)"
texas,3ayhol,RootHouston,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"It does not solve a real problem (voter fraud).  You know what? I think it does, a little bit. I just believe that a little percentage of anything is rotten, and our election system certainly fits that bill.  It's pretty damn good cover for what it is really doing: suppressing the vote.  Democrats are not suppressing the Republican vote (I mean I'm sure they are/do in some way), they are just bringing in voters on their side. Open borders plus amnesty gives them 20 million new voters—way more than are suppressed by Voter ID."
texas,3ayhol,HappyinAustin,2,Wed Jun 24 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"Don't you think that suppressing existing voters is fundamentally different from bringing in new people to be represented?  I mean:  A. Immigration happens regardless, be it quickly or slowly.  B. Suppressing someone's inalienable right to vote seems more unethical than allowing more people into the country. If someone is naturalized as a US citizen, our ancestors included, they become Americans with all the rights that you and I enjoy.   Again, I'm not picking party sides here. I really think that one is worse than the other. If the Republicans wanted to make it easier for some group that votes conservatively to emigrate, I would say it's sadly partisan, but I wouldn't equate it to suppressing the vote."

texas,3atgbl,KevanPrine,25,Tue Jun 23 11:07:44 2015 UTC,"I would find this article more useful if it mentioned numbers relative to the normal background level instead of just saying that these chemicals are seen in elevated levels. I am sure it isn't so good, but even a .0001% increase is elevated."
texas,3atgbl,kissthepan,16,Tue Jun 23 12:41:55 2015 UTC,"This was a scientific study, so ""elevated levels"" means ""statistically significant"". Of course, ""statistically significant"" doesn't mean actually significant - but it does mean that the difference has to be larger than the natural variation that exists, and enough larger that you can be quite sure that it is larger even based on the limited number of samples that were collected.  Thus, I'm certain that none of these chemicals is only 0.0001% elevated, because that wouldn't even be detectable, let alone outside the range of natural variation.  But of course, with a lot of these chemicals, an increase by a factor of ten might be clearly detectable and attributable to fracking, but still at most ambiguous regarding health and safety issues. Of course, whether or not they're currently at safe levels, if current activities have raised the levels, then there's a good chance they'll continue to raise them."
texas,3atgbl,easwaran,4,Tue Jun 23 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Well, 0.0001% is a number I used to present my argument and not indicative of the levels I expect they find. However, 0.0001% is 1ppm (part per million), the unit typically used for this time of thing. As far as I understand this is detectable.  percent to ppm  ppm as it relates to air quality"
texas,3atgbl,kissthepan,2,Tue Jun 23 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"I was considering that interpretation, but of course, as the second link shows, there are some chemicals (like ozone) that really are quite dangerous at the level of 1 ppm! (Sure, that example concerns air that you breathe constantly for a few hours, but there are plenty of other things that would get you from drinking water at 1 ppm. As a simple example, the active dose of LSD is under 100 micrograms, so at 1ppm LSD, 100 grams of water (less than half a cup) would get you totally tripping.)"

But I think the real issue is waste injection sites, not only from just fracking but all oil/gas activities. I feel like article should distinguish between the two activities."
texas,3atgbl,jadiusatreu,7,Tue Jun 23 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"3%, depending on what you're talking about can actually be insanely high. Most contaminates are listed dangerous at ppm, or parts per million.   The most recent journal article I read listed the discovery of fracking chemicals at the parts per billion and trillion scale: this would explain the title ""cancer-causing chemicals"" found as opposed to something like ""fracking chemicals found at cancer-causing levels."""
texas,3atgbl,James-Wing,-3,Tue Jun 23 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"FTA:   According to the study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, chemical leaks can occur when well casings fail. Some estimates show this happens in approximately 3 percent of new gas well operations, but the researchers point out that recent data indicate well casing failure rates closer to 12 percent within the first year of well operation.   3% of drilling operations have well casings that fail, possibly leading to water contamination. If 3% of these people's water was carcinogenic, they'd probably all be dead by now."
texas,3atgbl,eriwinsto,12,Tue Jun 23 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"This title is incredibly misleading. This is the kind of shit that gets shared around on facebook by morons.  The study in question specifically cites the inability to draw any conclusions about the source of the contamination, in fact noting that the samples were very likely to have been open to contamination from agriculture and urban sources.   Possibly the biggest gripe of all is that the study did not list any levels. ""Elevated"" could mean anything. It's exactly like the fear mongering around Fukishima that claimed radiation levels were 100 times above background, which essentially was less than you'd find in an apple. Really this hysteria has got to stop. There are some definite concerns with fracking, specifically waste water disposal, but lately it's become a ridiculous boogeyman blamed for all manner of shit that's been completely disproved over and over again.  Choice quotes from the study are listed below:   “Of the 550 samples, 339 (61.6%) were collected from water wells within 1 km of the nearest UOG well, which likely reflects the increased willingness of well owners to participate in this research in more heavily drilled areas.  Unfortunately, this opportunistic and necessarily biased sampling hindered our ability to make meaningful inferences regarding levels of contamination as a function of distance from nearest UOG well for several reasons  “This region includes a portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and outlying areas, and groundwater is potentially vulnerable to contamination from various urban and rural sources.”  “The detection of numerous volatile organic compounds in aquifers above the Barnett shale does not necessarily implicate unconventional UOG extraction as the source of contamination; however, it does provide an impetus for further monitoring and analysis of groundwater quality in this region.”"

texas,3atirv,rollotomasi07071,13,Tue Jun 23 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"I lived between Russia and Ukraine for five years, so hopefully I can offer some insight to those who don't know how they operate. First, I should say that Russians understand very little about the history of Texas, its independence movements and its desires.  The only reason Moscow could cause unrest in Ukraine is because they played on the well-established fears of the Russian population in the Eastern part of the country. In the rest of Europe, they just give the ultranationalists and neo-Nazis money, but can offer little more in the way of getting them in power. This gambit has some moderate success due to the natural growth of euroscepticism in addition to the Russian support. Without that euroscepticism, Russia alone would have little to no influence in Europe.  Since I haven't spent significant time in Texas in recent years, I won't speculate on the feelings towards the Texas Nationalist Movement. I suspect that there is no equivalent to euroscepticism (american-scepticism?) for Putin to prop up. But you guys would know better than me."

The people demanding separatism were very few, but very loud. Then Russia's propaganda made the rest of the population complacent. Most people thought the separatists were just idiots and alcoholics, but Russia made them question the new Ukrainian government, which made for a tough choice. Do you want to be ruled by criminals or nationalists? When I was there, I had the strong feeling that the vast majority wanted to stay in Ukraine, but that they didn't support the new government enough to take a stand.  Since Texas doesn't have this kind of situation, there's no real threat.

texas,3b022o,thestonedkoala,4,Thu Jun 25 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with any downvotes and expect them here. But you're comparing apples to oranges here. Our forefathers are worse than just dubious where race is concerned. But the Confederacy and it's symbols, be it the Stars and Bars or the Battle Flag, are founded wholly in a worldview that considered black Africans and their African-American progeny the lesser race. But the Confederacy was all about a war for slavery.  So while the US began with horrible things like the 3/5ths compromise, the Constitution written by these men has numerous ideals that are admirable. I won't defend Jackson. Won't even try. Jefferson though, to equate his legacy to what you're talking about (I believe you, but source?) is reductive. While ugly, it was not the centerpiece of his legacy. Unlike the Confederacy and the flags that represent it."

He was considered to be one of the greatest men of early America and yet his views on race was less than admirable. And he wasn't the only one. His legacy has been staked as a slave holder and as a scientist. And one of the things he believed in was that the negro man was inferior to the white man. That was the prevalent thought even to this day."

texas,3b022o,AnghellicKarma,6,Wed Jun 24 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"Texas secession from Mexico began more as a result of the federal government moving to a dictatorship, and away from the Constitution of 1824. Yes, slavery was an issue, but so was everyone not being Catholic, and not agreeing to do all business in Spanish.   Any Confederate flag refers specifically to the time frame in which certain states were trying to leave the union. Check this article, specifically ""Slavery was a big part of why the South wanted to secede"". I can't see how anyone wants to fly a flag in Port Aransas to indicate their regional affiliation for people in Newport News, VA. I just don't see what binds people across the former Confederate states that is not just solidarity toward the secessionist cause. While slavery was not the only issue, it absolutely was a huge issue.   Texas, therefore the flag representing it, has been an entity with a generally defined government and border for 179 years. The Confederate battle flag and variants refer very specifically to the fight to secede, and retain slavery, over 5 years."
texas,3b022o,ttufizzo,3,Thu Jun 25 03:54:13 2015 UTC,Texas fighting for independence from Mexico had little to do with slavery. Mexico asked for Americans to colonize the Texas area as a buffer between hostile native americans and Mexican citizens. That agreement was made under the pretense that the colonizers could remain American and keep their religion.  When a new man took power in Mexico he nullified that agreement and told the Texans thst they'd have to convert to Catholicism and become Mexicans renouncing their American citizenship. Yes slavery was also one of the stipulations but considering their right to their personal religion and citizenship status was under fire I'd say that slavery was on the bottom of their list of grievances.  You're looking for comparisons where there are none.

The Confederate flag has no business flying alongside the United States flag at any state capitol. The Confederate states committed an act of treason in leaving, and then attempting to overthrow the Union.   Why should that flag be flown alongside the USA one? It never should have been allowed to begin with. Can someone explain this to me?   Slavery/racial reasons and ""heritage"" aside, it was an act of treason and that flag should not be flown on govt property.   If you want to fly it at a state capitol, secede and do so."

Not knowing what you're talking about from the start is only going to weaken any stance you take.  The southern cross represents racism and bigotry stemming from a push in the 50's and 60's against the Civil Rights movement.  Statues, like the one at the capital, are to honor soldiers who may, or may not have, supported slavery. Many of them did not own slaves and all of them were defending their homes against hostile attacks. Just because they were in the Confederate army does NOT mean they supported the war, slavery, or the cause, just as every American now does not support the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I disagree entirely that a statue is more offensive than the southern cross. You're ascribing symbolism to a statue that, quite frankly, isn't there. It's never been there as a symbol of racism, hatred, bigotry, etc. Many countries honor their fallen troops; even those who lost the war."

Of course the union came marching through the south.

I don't think anyone deputes that but the reality is when you attack a United States military base with the intent of starting a war, especially on American soil, you're going to get what you're looking for. The Confederacy started the Civil War. Period. They wanted to fight with the union. You can't then turn around and say ""no fair!"" when the union retaliates in brutal but common military tactics.   The US did the same thing to Japan in WW2 but from the air when they carpet bombed the shit out of Japan. But again, Japan attacked the US bringing us into the war. People don't tend to point to the carpet bombing of Japan and say that the Japanese were victims of WW2. No, they got what they were looking for when America joined the war. Was it a tragedy that so many Japanese civilians died? Absolutely, but war is ugly and tragic and people die from it.  It is brutal and horrific and the majority of the people who die in slash and burn tactics are civilians. However, the fact still remains that slash and burn military advances are thousands of years old in war time techniques. It isn't new. And when you attack a sovereign country for the purpose of starting a war you open yourself up to those realities."

They felt that sacrifice, to save people, was worth building a statue about.   No one was thinking ""These boys died protecting slavery, yeehaw!""  A town in the Netherlands erected a statue of a German soldier in WWII because his actions were noble. Does that mean the Netherlands is embracing Nazi heritage? By your logic, it would.   Even in the most hellish of circumstances noble actions can be found that transcend whatever caused the battle.   To say that those defenders died defending slavery is disingenuous. Defending your home is going to strike a cord with people. People who may not have supported slavery or secession or even the war would have fought to protect their homes and family.   You're only implying they were defending slavery. How many of them, as they were dying thought ""Who is going to protect slavery now?"" (This is an appeal to emotion and I usually shy away from those illogical aspects but I'm trying to point out how ridiculous a notion it is that people defending their homes from devastation were still more concerned about protecting slavery.)   Other countries have memorials of fallen soldiers. It's commonplace. There are even shared memorials for Union and Confederate soldiers in the US.

You have not brought up slavery or racism.   Yes, the Confederacy brought the attacks upon themselves. No one is denying that. But defending yourself from devastation is really the only when you're backed against a wall.   You continue to assert however that two wrongs apparently make a right.   Treason is no excuse for war crimes, just like slavery is no excuse for treason.   You can't reason one wrong away just because it was brought about by another wrong.   If they had not defended themselves and the city been ransacked and civilians captured and/or killed.  Would that have been a better alternative?  I mean...the attack is already happening, there was no avoiding it. You defend yourself and win, defend yourself and die, defend yourself and be at the mercy of a known-to-be-ruthless general, or you surrender and be at the same mercy of the same man.   Only one of those is a guaranteed good outcome for you. They viewed the north as the bad guys. They were fighting for their lives against a ruthless enemy. At least that's what they were told.   Our soldiers were told the same thing going into Iraq. ""WMD's, go protect our country against terrorists"". Well, we were wrong and there were a lot of civilian casualities. Then we came home and built monuments for our fallen. Despite us being wrong and over there for the wrong reasons. Those monuments are a testament to hundred of thousands of people who died by our country's hand needlessly, yet we are proud of it.   Surely you can draw a parallel in that."
texas,3aw8lw,TwiztedImage,0,Thu Jun 25 22:04:54 2015 UTC,Or the people who started the war could have taken responsibility and surrendered.    The south was committing treason.

texas,3apqw7,contextsubtext,8,Mon Jun 22 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"I've been curious about this. Say I wanted to home school a kid at a young age, just pre-k through elementary, then regular school for middle and onward would it be bad for their development? For context we're not bible beaters. Dad is an artist, mom is a geologist. Both have no religion. Do you think that'd be bad?"
texas,3apqw7,Dogpool,13,Mon Jun 22 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"No, it won't.  But you need to assess your ability to guide you child.  It's the hardest thing you can do.  I'd recommend public till at least highschool, personally."
texas,3apqw7,TheTexasJack,8,Mon Jun 22 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"This is interesting to me because I'm the opposite. I recommend public at or before high school. But it really depends on how much you're out in the world. The thing which stifled me for a while was that I didn't get out of my house and interact with people enough; if you were to make sure your kid is doing stuff out in the world, I guess public high school would matter less, in my experience.  What do you think of that?"
texas,3apqw7,contextsubtext,3,Mon Jun 22 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"That's a big part of my question. Public school isn't just about books, but social engagement."
texas,3apqw7,Dogpool,4,Mon Jun 22 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"I think a big factor is the public school you have as an option. If you live near a highly rated exemplary school, it might be best to send your kid there. If you live near a poorly rated school, maybe home schooling is the best option."
texas,3apqw7,el-toro-loco,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. That said, I think the question is still largely one of socialization. I was a depressed enough teenager before I grew out of it, and I went to an average school. If I went to a below-average school, I bet I wouldn't have turned out as good. But I think that, regardless of the circumstances, keeping your kid interacting with the world is key."
texas,3apqw7,contextsubtext,3,Tue Jun 23 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"School doesn't necessarily need to be the way you interact them with the world.  Summer Camps, after school/community center programs (obviously not through the schools), boy scouts, sports, church/temple if you are religious has programs for people of different age groups. I just think it is important that a child is socialized by people of their age group and older so they know how to be around people their age and how to mature as they age."
texas,3apqw7,caffeineTX,3,Tue Jun 23 04:10:01 2015 UTC,"There's an alternative that is pretty amazing. Takes the social environment of school, and combines it with the pluses of homeschooling. I went to a school my last few years of high school called iSchool High, it's a program run at my local community college that allows highschoolers to dual-credit enroll in college too. So instead of taking English 4 your senior year of HS, you just take English 1301 as a dual credit class and it gives you the highschool credit for English 4, but also gives you college hours. You can technically earn a bachelor's degree by the time you graduate highschool with this school.  But that's not even the best part, this is what makes it homeschool-like if not better than any homeschool. You have 4 or 5 teachers for your entire school, each of which are the ""math"" or ""science"" teachers. You do your work in a system of workbooks (10 workbooks per class credit, with a test at the end of each book and no midterm or final) and you go at your own pace. There's deadlines you must meet but if you're efficient and know a bit about the subject all ready you can finish a high school class in 1/3 the time it takes traditionally. When you finish a workbook, you turn it in to the teacher and take a test on that book before moving onto the next one, and you're not allowed to move on unless you get a 90% on the test which makes all this reasonable to me. So you're able to work at your own pace on classes you choose to do in an order you want, take all tests on your own schedule when you're ready for them, and you get to replace high school credits with college hours.   I have never studied so hard or learned so much in such a short time before I went to that school. Sure it won't be for every kid as there were plenty of kids removed from the program for doing absolutely nothing the whole time but talking to friends, but for the majority this program works extremely well.   This form of alternate education is what I think is the ultimate answer to what we should do about our public school system lacking, and I believe there should be no reason to homeschool your kid when this exists. They have pre-k through 8th grade schools that utilize the same system but more kid-friendly, then the high school portion of the system is intertwined with college classes and offers almost complete freedom.  TL;DR: PLEASE don't homeschool your kids, Google "" Responsive Education Solutions""- it seems to be the company behind all this.. and after digging, looks like their only in Texas. Try to find a local company that does this if you're out of state."

I was just told vaguely about how there are Vista academies for pre-high school, so no not really.

The fact is that there are far more students who are publicly educated than educated in home schooling, and an administrator with public ed experience should be in this chair. I'm glad that you can afford have a spouse who does not work, but most of us are not in that position, particularly the poor, who rely extensively on public education.     We all know the statistics, yes, home schooled kids do perform better - that, in no way, makes a bible-thumping home school advocate qualified to chair the State Board of Education."
texas,3apqw7,dkppkd,3,Wed Jun 24 01:54:42 2015 UTC,One important part this does not take into consideration is economic status and genetics. If parents can afford for one to not work thru are likely well off. They are also likely to be genetically smarter. These two factors drastically improve a students ability to be successful.

But I'll see if I can find statistics for comparable groups, which I suspect will still show the trend.    I've done research in the past and found that genetics doesn't play as large of a role as you would expect.  If you took parents that have low levels of schooling and measurable intelligence and they took a high level of interest in the kid's education, you'd see similar results based upon past studies.  I think the differentiator with home schools is the time spent on studies.  Homeschoolers tend to get to work on long term projects and activities that take a lot of time in one sitting, like robotics or acting, that public schools don't tend to allow.  You get a different level of interest when they can focus on things they actually enjoy."

There were two bills introduced for Abbott's pre K initiative, one in the house and one in the senate. The one in the Senate would give over $3k per pupil reinstating all the funding that was cut and the one in the house would only reinstate a little less than half of the money allowing $1,500 per pupil.  http://www.texastribune.org/2015/02/26/huberty-prek/  Here is the link and time stamp to the amendment that specifically put in the $1,500 price mark when the author of the bill specifically states that it's Abbott's favored that price point. The author of the amendment says that the amendment is introduced to keep the funding at $1,500 rather than reinstating the full funding of $3,000+ per pupil. I can't remember the exact amount but the total funding dependency is $130 mill vs $300 mill.  What is interesting is that even though the author of the amendment states specifically Abbott's increase of $1,500 rather than fully reinstating the money ($3,000+ per pupil) the author of the bill skirts that issue and acts like there isn't really another price point being talked about at all.  http://tlchouse.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=38&clip_id=10575a  The time that discussion starts is at 4:25  I didn't know that this whole pre k initiative was just refunding money that was cut in 2011. So apparently this isn't even really some great initiative fueled by Abbott. It was just a half assed attempt to reinstate money already cut from the program a few years earlier, and to top it off they didn't even fully reinstate it even though they had the money to do it.  For an extra bonus you can watch an idiot rep. being called out by his fellow house member for bullshitting. He argued that we shouldn't waist money on pre K without knowing that it is worth it. Another member then stood up and said, ""Don't you send your children to pre K"". It was pretty hilarious. That starts at around 4:16"

There were two bills introduced for Abbott's pre K initiative, one in the house and one in the senate. The one in the Senate would give over $3k per pupil reinstating all the funding that was cut and the one in the house would only reinstate a little less than half of the money allowing $1,500 per pupil.   http://www.texastribune.org/2015/02/26/huberty-prek/  Here is the link and time stamp to the amendment that specifically put in the $1,500 price mark when the author of the bill specifically states that it's Abbott favored that price point. The author of the amendment says that the amendment is introduced to keep the funding at $1,500 rather than reinstating the full funding of $3,000+ per pupil.

You don't explain what you mean by ""sub-standard"" because you can't, I suspect.   You're trying too hard. It means ""below some standard"". Do public schools currently produce results that satisfy whatever your standards are?   What ""standard"" are our schools below?   That of practically every other industrialized nation.   The per capita levy for school taxes in Texas is less than $1000. That hardly seems exorbitant, and it amounts to only a fraction of most private school tuition rates.

Now, if Texas decides to fully fund public education, and she somehow manages to impose some sort of rigorous academic standards on homeschooling to make it more legimate, then great. She'll surprise me, but earn my respect and admiration.   What everyone (including myself) expects is that she lobbies for decreased oversight of the already woefully inadequate educational standards of homeschooling. Homeschooling in Texas isn't Ph.D. parents providing excellent education outside of the public school system, it's fundamentalist Christian parents avoiding exposing their children to the outside world while reinforcing young-earth, jesus-rode-dinosaurs dogma.

At this point I'd recommend you opt your kid out of all sex ed because it's going to be nothing but shame and Jesus based teaching that sex makes women worthless sluts and all men are sex fiends.

texas,3aui8c,rednoise,3,Tue Jun 23 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, and yet there are also huge tax breaks going out of this session. I predict a deficit, unless somehow oil prices skyrocket soon."
texas,3aui8c,eddiec02,2,Tue Jun 23 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"As a side note; with the general oil market, do you know why the price crashed? I can't find a straight answer. Some people think it has to do with a couple of OPEC countries flooding the market, but I'm not sure why they would do that -- it's not in their political or economic interests."
texas,3aui8c,rednoise,6,Tue Jun 23 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"We flooded the market. Exotic extraction techniques made it possible for American producers to raise output by over five million barrels per day in just a few years. Last year, overproduction coupled with signs of weaker demand in Europe and China prompted a slide, which was exacerbated by OPEC's decision not to cut production.  OPEC didn't cause the price fall. They simply refused to cut production. And why should they? From their point of view we created the problem. And they can get at their oil much more cheaply, which means they can make money at a lower spot price. Not so for these exotic producers whose margins were much thinner.  OPEC countries, of course, are not escaping unscathed. Most notably, Venezuela has experienced a balance of payments crisis that, coupled with their insistence on a pegged Bolivar, has led to serious monetary problems (the real value of the currency on the black market has plunged, and the government didn't have adequate foreign reserves to prop up the Bolivar). Now, they're relying pretty heavily on foreign loans from China and Russia."
texas,3aui8c,tonictuna,3,Tue Jun 23 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it. The US producers got pissed that OPEC didn't decrease production due to the their own overproduction. It was so fucking silly. Weak analogy: That's like Chevrolet complaining that Ford won't raise the price on their car so that Chevy can make a better profit-margin and compete at the same price point. The supply and demand changed, yet the hydraulic fracturing techniques have such a high operating cost that they couldn't compete.... now that they had flooded the market and caused the price to drop. So instead they wanted OPEC to cut their production so they could continue making money. OPEC basically said fuck off. Then the Fox News crowd blames OPEC for the crash, blah blah."
texas,3aui8c,rednoise,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Which is rather funny, since the Fox News crowds were complaining about high gas prices not a few years ago."
texas,3aui8c,eddiec02,5,Wed Jun 24 03:08:30 2015 UTC,"People can blame OPEC all day long but it seems to me we have done this to ourselves by overproduction here in the US. OPEC has actually maintained their production levels we have only increased over the past decade. Supply has increased and demand has remained constant, something had to give. So prices dropped."
texas,3aui8c,MarshallGibsonLP,2,Tue Jun 23 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"It's not in their short term interest, but ramping up production here is like starting up a loaded freight train, what with permits, mineral rights negotiations, infrastructure, etc.  Couple that with the fact that they are profitable at a lower price point, they can price us out of the market, shut down our production, and corner the market again.  Makes total sense over the long haul.  Also, I believe, but cannot prove, that we are encouraging this behind the scenes to fuck with the Russians and the Venezuelans.  This hurting them way worse than us (nationally speaking)."
texas,3aui8c,HandBananaHammock,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:03:29 2015 UTC,It's nice that everybody knows the oil is there and that at a certain price it is profitable.

texas,3aup67,Adult_Content,9,Tue Jun 23 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't fly it, I have no problem with people flying it on private property or wearing clothes with the flag printed on it. It should not be flown on any government property, however. Even if you completely ignore the racist connotations it holds,(and you shouldn't) it's the flag of a seditious government, and flying it should be seen as tantamount to treason against The United States."
texas,3aup67,Trainwreck92,15,Tue Jun 23 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"Two separate questions:  Should gov't buildings fly it?  Fuck no.   It should be prohibited. By national law if necessary. The problem is there no longer is a Confederacy.  And if there were--as a Texan and an American--I'm against being a part of it.  I don't want to be asked by my state, local or federal governments to be allegiant to it.    Furthermore, what is the point of flying a flag of a dead entity?  No army marches behind that flag.  No nation unites behind it.  Should private flying of the flag be outlawed?  No.  I don't support outlawing the flag (not that anyone prominent is suggesting that), but I think desiring to fly is at best weird and at worst shameful.  If you want to be proud of being a Texan or an Alabaman or whatever state you're from, I totally get that: there is a long and proud heritage for both of those entities and the people who have lived there. I can totally see why people would celebrate them.  However, why anyone would feel pride for the four year period when the Confederacy ruled the South and the Confederate battle flag was flown is totally beyond me.  There is no glory fighting for the things that were lost when the Confederacy collapsed.   A great many nice traditions that predated the Confederacy have survived until this day.  Yay for those.  Celebrate them.  However, every cultural vestige that began to die with the Confederacy (slavery, white supremacy, segregation, and treason) is something we should all agree deserved to die.

You can hate it all you want (and I'll be right there with you), but everyone needs the 1st Amendment to remain strong.  Public property - if that's what the people elect to do, then it flies.  I very much doubt Texans would vote for it to fly.  Sidebar: The license plate censorship was joke by the Supreme Court (5/4 vote).  As the minority dissent said - Texas set up a public forum which they can't legally restrain.   This is exactly the same type of forum that the highway maintenance volunteer signs fell into, which the Supreme Court upheld - they can't restrict which groups sign up for the highway slots.  (That said - I thought the renaming of the highway that the one racist group wanted to volunteer for was hilarious! lol)  Texas fell over itself into making money on custom license plates - and was bit in the ass for it.  They were lucky the SC happen to fall their way - and I still wonder if it remain unchallenged."

texas,3aup67,Orbitalpwn101,0,Tue Jun 23 20:03:25 2015 UTC,I think if there is popular consent then a confederate flag should be allowed to fly. Government is meant to be representative thus it should reflect the sentiments of its people. While that may offend sensibilities of other parts of the country that shouldn't come before the rights of locals to decide how they want their governments to act. In the majority of cases this will probably mean the flags will come down. In others it won't. In the end it should be up to the people who live there.

If you pay to park on the Seawall you can move around and park in different spots on the Seawall during your time. Same thing with The Strand.

texas,3apbap,MagicWishMonkey,4,Mon Jun 22 17:14:38 2015 UTC,"I believe that is a 1911 though someone can correct me but it generally is considered safe. It is known as ""Cocked and locked"".  http://www.usacarry.com/carrying-cocked-locked/  You can google for more information on the subject but as long as the safety is engaged there is no way for the gun to go off."

As a side note, open carrying, if at all, would be the only way I'd carry a pistol hammer cocked. I guess it's personal preference but I wouldn't feel comfortable with a single action hair trigger cocked and ready to go under clothes. Safety switch or no. Both my carry pistols are double action only."
texas,3apbap,lookattheduck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"This was sent as an attachment from the college I work for regarding this:   SB 11 by Birdwell Campus Concealed Carry Talking Points  • The Community College position on campus carry has been to provide a local option for colleges to “opt-out” of the bill’s provisions.  • SB 11 does not allow colleges to “opt out,” but does allow for the local college to create common sense regulations and rules as to how to implement the carrying of concealed weapons by license holders on college campuses.  Such considerations include:  High school students on college campuses taking dual credit courses   High school students enrolled in Early College High Schools located on a college campus   Childcare facilities located on a college campus   Medical facilities used to train nurses and other allied health professionals   The uniqueness of each campus  • Provisions of the Act do not take effect for Community Colleges until August 1, 2017, which will allow college leaders, faculty, and students time to discuss and examine what set of regulations and rules makes the most sense for each college."

Childcare facilities located on a college campus Medical facilities used to train nurses and other allied health professionals   These were precisely the limited exceptions that the Zerwas amendment was trying to carve out as areas that could exclude concealed weapons.  These examples literally came up in the legislative debate.   The uniqueness of each campus   What does this even mean?  Unless they are trying to say that each campus is so unique that someone who can otherwise conceal carry off campus will be so affected by the campus environment that they'll lose all sense of judgement and morality that carry will be an extreme hazard and should therefore be banned.

Your other example doesn't even remotely describe a reason for not having concealed carry.  An accident, amongst millions of concealed carriers is hardly an empirical argument.  If its the case I'm thinking of, the lady was showing her gun to a friend when it fired (after she pulled the trigger trying to unjam it) which defeats the whole point of concealed carry.  She was charged and fired.  Can't fix stupid - still not a good reason to ban concealed carry on campus especially when those same people safely conceal carry everywhere else"

texas,3apbap,Guy_Dudebro,3,Tue Jun 23 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"This is not a ""regulation."" This is about how to set up a system of automatic trespass and still be halfway fair to those who must abide by the signs. The state is saying, ""Okay, we will make it so someone who carries a gun on your premises is instantly guilty of trespassing without ever being told to leave, but only if the sign meets such and such a standard."" That's a compromise which is more than fair to hoplophobic business owners.  Imagine accidentally walking into a place where failing to notice a sign because it's too inconspicuous could land you in jail (this used to be a class A misdemeanor). Asking the owner to comply with a few specifics in order to exercise the privilege and power of insta-jailing another person isn't too much, is it?  No one is saying ""you can't kick a gun-toter out of your store unless you have a compliant sign."" You just have to tell them to leave verbally like anyone else."
texas,3apbap,the_shootist,-3,Tue Jun 23 03:27:00 2015 UTC,The signs are required to be huge in multiple languages. Gun nut legislators insisted that a pictograph would not suffice.

texas,3apbap,the_shootist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"The signs are required to be huge   They're not ""huge."" The letters must be 1"" That's not so hard is it?   in multiple languages.   It is not only English speakers who deserve fair warning that they may be about to commit a crime. The two overwhelmingly most common languages in this state are English and Spanish. That's not at all unreasonable. You're really grasping.   Gun nut legislators insisted that a pictograph would not suffice. This is an intentional burden on business owners to discourage them from banning open carry in their places of business.   It's not a pro-gun thing. There are certain standards relating to all premises related auto-crimes (purple paint, 1"" x 8"" etc). And there are plenty of sign requirements out there which are regulations, as in you must display these and it is not optional (hint: 30.06/7 signs are optional). Visit any liquor store - they're covered in them. I personally think it's all ridiculous, but it's just the bureaucracy that many of you love so much. They're not maliciously designed to be a ""burden."" Are you going to shout at the TABC for not offering a No-Booze pictograph?  And you you can put a pictograph if you want. Most carriers will likely respect it and be more than happy to oblige your request for a boycott! It just won't -- by itself -- have any instantaneous legal force. If you don't want a big ugly sign, then don't have one. No one's forcing you. You will just need to to actually speak to another human being if you want to trespass them and have it be enforceable.  Seriously, people. Imagine if you had a mall that had a sign that said No Smoking or No Photography, and rather than those acts being a simple code of conduct breach for which you could be politely and peacefully ejected, they were 100% legally binding and if you accidentally did those things, you would go to JAIL.  This is a case where there must be some objective standard set by the state, and this is it. It's not about your right to kick people out; it's about your right to put people in jail. It's a clear standard that's been in place for years. Get over it."
texas,3apbap,the_shootist,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:40:36 2015 UTC,You have to post a sign that in practical terms is several feet in length and a couple in width. It has to be at the entrance to the premises. It's a burden. It's obnoxious. It wouldn't be necessary if gun nuts didn't insist that they be by default allowed to openly carry deadly weapons simply everywhere. Don't want problems associated with carrying a deadly weapon? Don't carry a deadly weapon.  Funny how it's all about minimal regulation and minimal government intervention and minimal coercion until you want to carry your weapon around so you can feel like you're safe at the Shop-N-Stop with the old ladies and housewives.
texas,3apbap,the_shootist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"You have to post a sign...    NO. You don't. There is absolutely nothing preventing you from trespassing an OCer even if you don't have a compliant sign. How is it you still don't understand that?   Funny how it's all about minimal regulation and minimal government intervention and minimal coercion until you want to carry your weapon around   One more time. It is YOU and your store owners who seek to use the power of the state against another via an automatic trespass law. It is YOU who seek additional intervention. Otherwise, it'd just be a guy walking onto a merchant's premises and being asked to leave -- with all the already-existing consequences for trespassing if he refused.  You want to call this regulation? It's regulation YOUR SIDE requested so that you wouldn't undergo the terror of having to actually use your lips and speak (oh God no!) to an OCer and orally tell them to leave.  30.06 and 30.07 are special-case, just-for-you-hoplophobes, automatic trespass laws. Above and beyond existing, no-shirt-no-shoes, sir-you-have-to-leave trespass law (30.05). The government intervention is still coming from your side in this case. They simply temper and balance that intervention with an objective standard.  If you want to talk about practicality, you as a store owner can simply post the 30.06 sign for CC, which will be the same size it has been for decades, and rely on oral trespass for OC. The only thing missing is your ability to have the OCer thrown in JAIL like you fantasize about. OR, if you must imprison people to enforce your preferences, put up the two ""huge"" ugly signs.  Edit: verbal->oral"

texas,3aqn93,CeleryStickBeating,2,Mon Jun 22 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  Shoulder lanes are not for driving - all sorts of tire hazards await there.  A lot of people do it to be courteous, myself included, but it really is taking a serious risk when you do.  My dad told me long before I started driving that the worst thing people that do is to believe a car is a time machine.  I learned the hard way how true this is.  Best advise: Good tunes and deep breaths.  lol"
texas,3aqn93,jswilson64,-1,Mon Jun 22 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"Of corse! And believe me, I'm not in any rush, trust me. It's that sometimes it gets ridiculous how slow some people drive on this road. These days the way cars are built and if seat belts are worn it is perfectly safe to drive the designated speed. Even for elderly folks. If they're following too close and don't have quick reaction times, they should back off the car in front. Just like everyone should.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer safe driving. But 20 below the speed limit is not safe. It is also dangerous. Like cresting a hill, a driver behind the hill cannot see the other driver going abnormally slow  speeds and gets rear ended. If the driver in front had been driving a little faster, the driver behind believing the speed limit wouldn't have crashed into them. I've had a close call on 36 for this exact reason. A driver completely stopped just over the crest of a hill turning left, with 3 cars infront of me. And another when a driver was just driving a reduced speed because they had just pulled into the road right after a bend. This is exactly what the shoulder is for."
texas,3aqn93,Atomichawk,2,Mon Jun 22 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that people should do the limit or let you pass at their earliest convenience. But you're fooling yourself of you think cars these days are so safe. Just for fun watch crash test videos of your car. Sometimes you can only find 35mph videos which are survivable, but honestly surprisingly bad from at least one angle usually. At 55 it already gets hard to watch. At 70 god help you. You may survive but your life is likely to change.  I was t-boned at maybe 20-30mph and it's changed my life. I had cervical kyphosis, shoulder and arm pain and issue with my droving leg. Basically the entire right side of my body. I have to maintain good posture, do physical therapy and avoid certain movements just to keep the pain at a manageable level.  Definitely changed the way I looked at driving. I hate driving and especially here in Houston. I'll be moving to another state soon and there's many reason, but car dependency is a big one and the most urgent one to me. Every time we get on the road we risk our lives. And in Houston that's every time you leave your house. I just want to get somewhere with public transportation and with less risks involved in driving when necessary, backdropped by mountains. And I'm terrified some inattentive driver is going to stop me before I make it late this year."

I'm sorry you are dealing with your car accident.  Houston is growing in every way, it is getting packed. I'm on the north west side of Houston, off 290. It has exploded with business and population. I can definitely see why you'd want to get out.  I'll agree it's very dangerous to drive. Any time you get into the seat of a car you are risking life and limb. I am fully aware of the hazards of the road. No argument there. As long as you are abiding the law and being alert on the road, you will be fine, so as nothing unexpected happens. That is the danger.  Car accidents also look worse than they actually are. Vehicles are designed to ""crunch"" to allow the full brunt of an impact to be absorbed in the safety features and designs around a car. But none the less, still very serious and dangerous. No argument."

texas,3aqn93,jswilson64,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is called an impedance. If some crazy guy was running around the highway on say I10, and someone hits him going 75, should we reduce the speed limit because the driver couldn't react to the impedance? No, that wouldn't make sense. A cow shouldn't be on a road, unless clearly cautioned road signs are in place, and the owner of the cow, if found, would be held responsible. Nor a slow moving or stopped car. Hence the shoulder lane. I'm going the speed limit, if not +or- 10% of it depending on the area. It's in our Trafic Code. I'm not here arguing why I can't drive 100+ mph, all I'm saying is that people are going too slow for the designated speed limits, and I want to know why. It pisses me off when I have to slow down to 50 mph because some idiot can't find the gas pedal to safe his life while I'm almost hitting him going the speed limit on the road which is 70. Mean while that person can move over, let me do my thing, and that guy will be doing his thing. Point and simple. I don't understand what the argument is or what point this comment string is trying to make.  If everyone went the speed limit and used the shoulders correctly there would not be any problem for me."

Also, state transportation code says the shoulder ""may"" be used to allow the passing of faster traffic. Not ""must.""  The shoulder is not a lane, it is a dangerous place, ask any cyclist you see.   It pisses me off when I have to slow down to 50 mph   This is the crux of your argument.  Irrational anger.

Granted this was two decades ago, but managers would come and go quickly, and every one saw the store as a stepping stone to a higher position, and they thought that the way to show their worth was to improve their numbers, and their favorite way was to cut costs -- by cutting hours until they had barely enough people to do what needed to be done -- keeping everybody in fire fighting mode, all the time.  Of course, customer service suffered when they did this, but that's harder to measure than payroll costs ...  Ultimately, professionally, leaving that place was the best thing I ever did, and every time I go back to that store (Austin #11/#227, Slaughter and Manchaca) -- it's a celebration that I don't work there any more.  That said ... it's definitely the best place to shop.  The only place that comes close in terms of price is Walmart, and they fall short in other ways."

texas,3aipih,KikiFlowers,2,Sat Jun 20 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"They know their customers very well.  Of course there are common elements among all stores but each store is unique in the mix of items it carries.  They are very good at figuring out what that mix needs to be for any particular store.  The other thing that allows them to beat out Walmart is that they are a grocery store first and foremost.  Their supply chain has been centered around perishables from day one.  Walmart tried to adapt an existing supply chain to handle perishables.    When I lived in Indianapolis, there was a world of difference between the suburban and urban Kroger stores.  They built superstores in the suburbs and let the smaller urban stores get run down.  The suburban stores had huge produce sections with good quality and a lot of variety.  The urban stores would have pretty much nothing but tomatoes, onions, lettuce, apples, banana, and oranges and the quality was lacking.  The only people who would choose to shop there are people who have no car so it really created a perception that poor people didn't deserve quality.  HEB also does a good job of keeping smaller, inner city stores profitable which has allowed them to maintain market share and fend off smaller ethnic chains like El Rancho and La Michoacana that would take their place if the quality of those urban stores dropped."

texas,3aeo6h,TexMarshfellow,26,Fri Jun 19 17:31:01 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree on In-N-Out! I still enjoy it but I'll take Whataburger over it most any day.
texas,3aeo6h,utchemfan,-3,Fri Jun 19 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"That's reasonable! I grew up visiting family in California so In-N-Out has always been a favorite of mine, and there's just something about a clean fast food restaurant. That said, we don't have an In-N-Out here in Beaumont and probably won't for a while; Whataburger is definitely my #2!"
texas,3aeo6h,TexMarshfellow,11,Fri Jun 19 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"You've clearly never been to Orange County. Every In-N-Out I've been to there was both dirty and had poor service.

texas,3aeo6h,TheGreatRanchero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"Well I mean they have a little bit more than one thing, but that's basically true. But that's okay with me; when I go to a burger joint, I want a burger.  Also I'm not really a fries eater in general, but I ask for them extra dark and I put my own salt and pepper on like anyone  is capable of doing (and which is usually necessary at Whataburger as well). It works out pretty well.   Plus, at least In-N-Out gets my order right. They may only offer a few core options, but you can customize those quite a bit. At Whataburger I can barely get them to give me the right vegetables."
texas,3aeo6h,TexMarshfellow,10,Sat Jun 20 00:24:58 2015 UTC,"Lol I've had some unfortunate experiences with in n out. Even though I've only been there twice, each time my fries were damn near frozen"
texas,3aeo6h,SpaghettiSaur,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:40:32 2015 UTC,I find that hard to believe as every in-n-out has their own french fry maker and you can actually see them make your fries fresh at a lot of them!
texas,3aeo6h,jaguilar94,-4,Fri Jun 19 17:42:54 2015 UTC,Weird considering In-N-Out doesn't freeze their food and their fries are always fresh cut. You can watch them do it.
texas,3aeo6h,TexMarshfellow,3,Fri Jun 19 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"I went to In-N-Out for the first time awhile back and I didn't see what is so special about them. Sure the burgers are fine but not really much better or worse than anywhere else.  My favorite burgers are probably from Wendy's but really, this whole ""my favorite burger is better than your favorite burger"" is so stupid."
texas,3aeo6h,NakedAndBehindYou,-2,Fri Jun 19 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"In-N-Out uses objectively better and tastier ingredients. Fresh vegetables, decent buns, and never-frozen beef. That's why I prefer it—and why most people do.   And I'm not a huge fan of Wendy's but it's not bad.  Personally, I don't really care about the existence of the debate,  or eating if you're downvotes.  People who think other chains are better are just is entitled to their own wrong opinions as I am to my own correct one. Lol"

texas,3anb8p,Syllogism19,17,Sun Jun 21 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"Confederate flags are widely used as a symbol of racism and hate.  These commemorations, statues, paintings, etc. are not the same thing.  There's only one flag in any of those pictures and it's ACTUALLY the flag of the Confederacy instead of the Rebel flag made popular by hate groups.  The vast majority of people who fought that war were not slave owners. It's not fair to characterize them as pro-slavery, racists without knowing more about them as individuals.  Many of them felt they had no choice but to go to war because their state was going to war. After the Union swept into the South, some likely enlisted to protect their homes rather than actually fight for the Confederacy.  A knee jerk reaction to the SC shooting and consequent flag controversy isn't prudent. There's a lot of history there that doesn't have racial undertones."
texas,3anb8p,TwiztedImage,3,Mon Jun 22 09:21:19 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the motives of the people who fought the war, (which was for the preservation of human bondage), the motives of the people who commemorated the war are pretty clear.  They were done to assert white power.  They were done to assert falsehoods about the origin of the war (saying it was about states rights).   Because we desire to perpetuate, in love and honor, the heroic deeds of those who enlisted in the Confederate Army, and upheld its flag through four years of war, we, the children of the South, have united in an organization called ""Children of the Confederacy"" in which our strength, enthusiasm, and love of justice can exert its influence. We, therefore, pledge ourselves to preserve purse ideals; to honor our veterans; to study and teach the truths of history (one of the most important of which is, that the war between the states was not a rebellion, nor was its underlying cause to sustain slavery), and to always act in a manner that will reflect honor upon our noble and patriotic ancestors."
texas,3anb8p,TwiztedImage,2,Mon Jun 22 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be better to remove their justification (that whole passage seems absurd) and replace it with something less politically charged and more historically educational?

texas,3anb8p,Deepspacesquid,2,Mon Jun 22 15:16:02 2015 UTC,This is great. These shouldn't be removed but they should be editted. Removing them would remove the complexity of the war and damage the dialog of the civil war.
texas,3anb8p,TwiztedImage,2,Wed Jun 24 03:13:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately nobody else seems to think so. They're hell bent on being politically correct while remaining ignorant to history and the impacts their actions will have on the future generations' understanding of history.

They don't seem to mind other influential slave owners in this country's history though. They also don't seem to mind countless other similar instances of the same thing (named buildings, statues, roads, schools, etc.) They are picking and choosing which ones...it's disingenuous at best."
texas,3anb8p,Malik_Killian,2,Wed Jun 24 04:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's not like those were put there 20 or 30 years ago, they were put there by those who knew the people represented in the monuments.  It's too late to recapture the sentiment of that era or ask them to revise their statements.  We could write down the original messages of course, but is everyone going to bother to look up what it used to say?  Probably not, and even if we wrote something completely objective it would be rewriting history because the words have already been chosen."
texas,3anb8p,Deepspacesquid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:02:42 2015 UTC,I agree that rewriting is something to avoid.  But to remove a false narrative and replace it with a complete would be constructive. Also there are tons of historians who would love to help out.
texas,3anb8p,sldkfjslknalskdfsldk,2,Thu Jun 25 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between mourning the dead and honoring the cause.  If you read the actual inscriptions on the monument's inscriptions, it does both.  You kind of make it seem like it's only doing the former.     The vast majority of people who fought that war were not slave owners.   Slavery was an extremely popular political position among southern whites at the time of secession.  Poor whites supported slavery because it kept them at the 2nd to the bottom socio-economic rung, instead of the bottom like trailer trash is today.  I recommend ""This Mighty Scourge"" by James M McPherson who talks about southern opinion at the time of secession and how its been twisted by southern historians in the decades since in order to make the south's cause more palatable."

It often seems as if people will not be happy until the south appologizes for slavery from 150 years ago by closing up shop and setting itself on fire until every last visage of the past has been reduced to cinders and every last descendant of those who lived through it has died."

The drug overdose bill was the most egregious veto, and it was because the bill's author wouldn't make the changes that Abbott's staff wanted. It sucks, but Perry would veto ~40 bills per session without warning the authors at all.   The plastic bag and tree bans went nowhere, and they fracking ban passed with wide bipartisan support - so you can't place the blame on the governor for that one. With regards to marijuana, who on Earth thought Abbott was a fan of decriminalization in the first place? This isn't exactly big news for a conservative Republican.

texas,3adnp1,TwiztedImage,2,Fri Jun 19 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm keenly aware of that.  But the industry is playing stupid. When a citizen says ""Fracking is causing earthquakes and poisoning our water."" They know its not the fracking, they know its the wastewater injection. So instead of explaining that, they just defend fracking with no explanation.  ""Because I said so"" is universally considered a shitty answer and that's currently all they're offering up. If they would just admit that recent studies are linking wastewater injection to these concerns and that they are exploring options of disposal to avoid those issues, that would be a step in the right direction.  JFK held himself accountable and people loved him for it. When you consistently absolve yourself of responsibility; people hate you."

texas,3adnp1,Lobo_Marino,0,Fri Jun 19 13:31:33 2015 UTC,Or maybe you should wait until evidence that there is a link is made before you make a connection that hasn't been proven yet? Pointing the finger at this point does nothing but cause unnecessary drama.  These companies take these things very seriously. They are not interested in contaminating. Contamination means they are LOSING OUT ON PRODUCT THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL.   Don't be so ignorant.
texas,3adnp1,OutspokenPerson,6,Fri Jun 19 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that operators want to contaminate. It's just that their interests aren't aligned with those who want reasoned regulation and protections. The industry's interests are centered on extracting as much as possible while spending as little as possible to do it. If cutting corners is profitable or if skirting liability for externalities saves money, they'll do it. That's borne out by history and common sense.  As for a causal link, that's kind of sticky. There's mounting evidence that fracking activity correlates to elevated levels of exogeneous methane as well as other, nastier contaminants in groundwater. Studies have demonstrated a pretty strong correlation between proximity to fracked gas fields and exogeneous methane, which seems to be zeroing in on a demonstrable causal link. But what industry insists is that claimants be able to meet pretty extreme standards for links, as if a molecule ought to be traced directly from one place to another.  I think these operations can be conducted safely and profitably, but let's not pretend that industry is really a partner in this. Only society, through the state, can exert any real measure of balance, just as has been the case with exploitative labor practices, etc."

That still doesn't mean I appreciate misrepresentation of the facts, even if the offender is supposedly on my side. OP posted the article as well as the quote by Sharon Wilson with Earthworks at the end of the article. The implication between the post title and chosen quote (simply stated as being ""from the article"") is that the result of the study means we should immediately cease use of our tap water. That's a pretty extreme conclusion, and not one backed up by statements from the conductors of the study.  The article states nothing about Sharon Wilson other than her affiliation with Earthworks. I don't know her educational background. I don't know her scientific background. I have nothing to back up the idea that her opinion is worth the paper it's written on, and I don't appreciate the use of her quote by OP to forward an agenda because it makes us ALL look bad both to the opposition and in the public eye.   *Edited for wording clarification.

Edit: Who knows, maybe every shower I take IS leaching chemicals into my skin and lungs. It's not exactly my area of expertise and I don't claim to be versed in the subject enough to know either way.

This is Zac Hildenbrand's new operation, since his last organization apparently failed. And notice how well schooled he is, also! The University of Texas at El Paso! What is more ""alarming"" than this study is that any major news outlet would treat it as serious science conducted by experts.  If someone can prove damages due to fracking, a practice that begin in the 1940's and has been used hundreds of thousands of times across the nation in the decades since, then by all means, let the parties responsible pay. At this point, though, the correlation between ""contamination"" of water sources within 400 feet under the surface to fractures of shale thousands of feet beneath the surface is questionable at best."

texas,3aehvd,TiptoeingThruTonight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am biased. As a tax practitioner, I see many Tax court cases where the taxpayer's problems have been complicated by failing to apprise the IRS of their new addresses. This IRS memo outlines how directly notifying the IRS or changing one's address with the USPS avoids this problem. http://www.irs.gov/pub/lanoa/pmta01634_7415.pdf. Nonetheless, these cases continue to crop up. See, e.g. Gyorgy v. Comm'r, 779 F.3d 466 (7th Cir. 2015). Looking at your statement closely, it is obvious that it says nothing about forwarding mail, merely that the USPS delivers lots of single-piece mail to many different places. This can be accomplished by forwarding mail using the USPS or by directly updating senders of the new address."
texas,3aehvd,CeleryStickBeating,0,Fri Jun 19 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say a high volume of single-piece mail (meaning direct correspondence) to many destinations indicates that people are sending mail to one another and expect to receive it. That means they're likely to forward their mail when they move.  I'm not really sure what you're arguing here, particularly the very last bit."

texas,3acti1,cinereoargenteus,5,Fri Jun 19 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"The city is really growing on the south side.   You'll learn really fast which neighborhoods to avoid, like north of I-37 (The Cut).  On the bay side of South Padre Island Drive (SPID), it depends.  You'll find everything from mansions and crackhouses all within a couple of blocks from each other.  All the streets suck no matter where you live.  So many potholes.  It's windy, hot, and humid.    Lots of opportunities for outdoor recreation- mostly water-related.  I don't love it, but I don't hate it."
texas,3acti1,CovingtonLane,4,Fri Jun 19 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Windy, hot, and humid.  The wind is great for windsurfing and sailing. Just be aware that you can get sunburned on a cloudy day. Flat, except for uptown and downtown. Long seawall overlooking C.C. Bay. Great spot for the public fireworks. Salt water, sand dunes, beaches, surf.   Snoopy's is the best seafood. Whataburger is the best fast food. HEB the best grocery store.   It is hurricane country. Before buying a house, understand the cost of flood insurance. Do not buy property just above sea level. They haven't had a bad hurricane since Celia in 1970, but sooner or later they will.   Some people dislike the taste of the city water. Try it ice cold. The tap water never gets ice cold. The weather seldom gets below freezing, but don't underestimate how cold it gets with high humidity on cold windy days. Snow? Once every six years. Maybe. Doesn't stick."

I guess I would say that if you are middle to upper middle class and higher, you will probably like it.  If you can buy a house and maybe a boat or a beach vehicle and like to do outdoorsy stuff.  There are some majorly nasty parts, like any other city.   Shopping is pretty good, and so is the eating out.  There isn't much more to do other than those things (eat out, shop, beach)."

texas,3a9uhz,coolcrosby,10,Thu Jun 18 11:09:23 2015 UTC,"Appraisal districts are also great ways of looking up information on people. Unlisted in the white pages? No problem, as long as I know the general area you live in I can probably find you through your property tax documents, all online.  Want to know who your neighbors will be when buying a home? Appraisal districts usually have interactive maps so you can see the details of the property around you.  Want to get an idea of how much your coworkers are worth? Appraisal district lists their home's appraised value online, and square footage, and previous property taxes, etc. etc. etc."

texas,3a9uhz,bruschetta1,3,Thu Jun 18 15:47:46 2015 UTC,People would be more apt to update their address on their license if they didn't have to pay each time (and wait in the horrendous lines).

texas,3a9uhz,DontCallMeInTheAM,2,Mon Jun 22 06:41:10 2015 UTC,"No system is perfect and DLC CS reps for DPS do there best in getting proof of residence, but if a person goes out of their way to keep the address of their physical residence off any of their residency documents, it will be hard for the DLC to tell if they actually live there or not.  DPS does have a system in place to check this stuff after the fact, but from what I understand they don't often act on it right away, but observe instead, because it can often lead to discovering criminal activity.  Edit:  Also, you only have to provide your physical residence as your address on non-CDL license.  CDL drivers can use a PO box or even the address of their employer on their license.  So those people in the article listing the UPS store as the address on their license could very well be CDL drivers."
texas,3a9uhz,jeremysbrain,2,Thu Jun 18 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"Cdl drivers still have to provide a physical address, but the mailing address must go on the card.  You are right about everything else though, we only ask for proof of residency on original applications and have no way to verify information.
