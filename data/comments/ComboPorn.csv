ComboPorn,3bec25,lolpounder,3,Sun Jun 28 12:47:54 2015 UTC,this is my main game  that combo is fucking stupid.
ComboPorn,3bec25,hawtsalsa1337,2,Sun Jun 28 21:45:17 2015 UTC,Cerebella combos at launch were so much more bullshit they actually made me quit SG. Cere/Para/Valentine teams all day. Fuckers.  Solo Felicia Filia always got stomped :(
ComboPorn,3bec25,obsidianchao,2,Mon Jun 29 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"What's worse is Felicia is a Marvel character :(  The game is a lot different! Pick it back up, you may just love it :)"
ComboPorn,3bec25,hawtsalsa1337,2,Mon Jun 29 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"Shit, I meant... you know who I meant. I think.  Yeah, honestly, I sold all my fightsticks (used to be a custom builder) and moved onto Smash, dropped traditional fighters. I've heard TEs are pretty cheap now so I might have to pick fighters back up."
ComboPorn,3bec25,obsidianchao,2,Mon Jun 29 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"pick up a q4raf, those are top tier sticks (black one had 0 lag on ps3, minimal lag on xbox), for $150.  I actually just moved from smash to traditional fighters LOL. I won an eightarc ebony fusion in a raffle at a tournament I TO'd smash for and just quit from then on"

ComboPorn,3bec25,MystyrNile,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:32:11 2015 UTC,Filia! Thank you!
ComboPorn,3bec25,obsidianchao,2,Mon Jun 29 22:21:47 2015 UTC,I've seen worst.

ComboPorn,3bawtu,pepopulo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:41:25 2015 UTC,Probably one of the best ways to show people that you don't need to button mash or be massively technical to play SF well.
ComboPorn,3bawtu,NL_Cereal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:23:31 2015 UTC,"I agree mashing is counterproductive and being highly technical isn't SUPER necessary, but these combos ARE extremely technical."
ComboPorn,3bawtu,meteojett,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"Desk is the best of the best at crazy SF4 combos, haha. I wonder if he will premier a new combo video at this year's Evo Championship?"
ComboPorn,3bawtu,meteojett,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Actually I heavily disagree, Doopliss is the most creative SF4 cmver atm. Also IIRC Error1 carried most of the evo premier stuff there, and from the little activity I've seen at combovid.com I don't think there'll be a cmv this year (mainly cuz almost every single combo vieo on EVO was prepared or helped to be made thanks to Maj, which said that this year he won't organize anything)"
