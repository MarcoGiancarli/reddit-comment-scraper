sciencefiction,3e32rb,HelperBot_,21,Wed Jul 22 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"I think somehow we have forgotten the whole meaning of the utopia. It is not only an optimistic vision whereas a dystopia would be a pessimistic vision. Thomas More wasn't imagining the future in his original Utopia, he imagined a different society, based on different principles, that we may consider ""better "" than ours. His Utopia was a point of comparison, used to deride indirectly the monarchy of Henry VIII... Modern utopias tend to be different because instead of criticising our current world, they imagine what it could become if mankind makes the right choices etc... Besides that, utopia can be challenging for a writer in terms of storytelling: if everything goes right, there is no story to tell. And quite often a utopian world can turn into a real nightmare when the story unfolds. Sometimes the line between utopia and dystopia is really thin."
sciencefiction,3e32rb,superfrenchdude,6,Tue Jul 21 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that the word 'Utopia' is itself a pun, a jibe at the very idea of the 'Utopia' itself. It is simultaneously derivative of the Greek εὖ (""good"" or ""healthy"") and τόπος (""place"") as well as οὐ (""not"") and τόπος (""place""), meaning 'nowhere,' maybe even 'impossible.'   Probably the earliest piece of what we might call 'utopian fiction' is Plato's Republic which, according to one compelling reading, is a criticism of the idea of creating perfect states; as Plato's city is predicated on the elimination of some essential human characteristics from the human person- by 'abstracting Eros'.  The point being, there is perhaps a reason why much of our dystopian fiction takes place in societies that saw themselves as attempts at Utopia, and why we lack compelling visions of 'No-Place.'"
sciencefiction,3e32rb,bnr55,3,Tue Jul 21 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"heh, in that case make a utopia and put a story in it that does not invalidate the premise. That is, make a wonderful place, and put a murder mystery in it, or a rescue, or a love triangle."

I would think most utopian fiction tries to do both: both show what's wrong with current society and show a better way."
sciencefiction,3e32rb,forkinanoutlet,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"It's also important to note that while Thomas More's Utopia was possibly better, it was also completely fucked up.  Remember the point when Thomas More talks about how the Utopians fight wars? It's just a couple of pages towards the end of the book, but he basically explains that they hire these mercenaries called Venalians. Venalians basically do fuck all except tend cattle, hunt and steal, so the Utopians view them as lesser beings and use them to fight their wars.  They promise them riches and lavish rewards beyond their wildest dreams because they know that most of them are going to die fighting. More goes on to describe that there are Utopians sent to do battle, but they're all highly-trained, have the best equipment available, and it's all volunteer work.  So even though the Utopians are basically god-tier warriors, they sent these ""savages"" to fight their battles for them because they view them as inherently wicked.  Right before they leave, the group converts a bunch of Utopians to Christianity and one of them gets exiled for preaching overzealously. This is in accordance with a law that states freedom to practice religion unless you believe the soul dies with the body and you do not believe in providence, in which case you are not allowed to hold public office, work in any public service... you're basically a pariah.  The whole point of Thomas More's Utopia is that even in the ""perfect society,"" shit is still extremely fucked up for those who don't believe in them or ascribe to their laws; they face exile or enslavement.  Utopia is not a utopia. The whole point of the book is that Utopia is a horrible place.  Shit, you could go back further to Plato's Republic and note that he frequently cracks jokes about how it's his own personal dream land. At one point he's describing how all the young, sexy people would exercise naked during the mandatory exercise period, and when one of his disciples asks about the old people, he says ""Oh, well they would wear clothes, that's gross.""  A true utopia is fucking boring unless something threatens it. If the threat comes from within, then it's a dystopian story, but if the threat comes from outside, then I think you've got more of a classic hero story than a look a criticism of government and society.  Not that that's a bad thing, but I wouldn't call that a utopian story."

People still can be selfish, betray each other, do stupid shit. But the impact is different specifically because society is organized differently.

It's a lot more than just adding lasers and spaceships to a boring love story that could've been told anywhere.  Or at least it should be."

I actually like how Stargate handled this -- humanity kept using chemical kinetic impact weapons even after gaining access to energy weapons because they worked, and because the most readily available energy weapons were designed more for intimidation and shows of force than actually fighting wars. But Stargate came out at a time when modern guns in a sci-fi setting was rare, and it also featured the aliens using energy weapons. Hell, it featured aliens."

That may be KSR's opinion, but he repeatedly asserts it in a way that implies it's settled science. That makes me inclined to take the rest of what he says with a grain of salt.  It's quite possible it turns out that was can only use quantum computers as accelerators for specific tasks. They may never be ""programmable"" in the sense classical computers are.

sciencefiction,3e2dsj,and710,5,Tue Jul 21 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"OK.  I can see you're going for a good old-fashioned SF adventure yarn here, and you have some aspects of the form down OK.  But there were some problems from my point of view.    Number one is your premise: a giant worm in space is kind of silly.  You're giving us what seems to be, well, maybe not super-hard science fiction, but at least sort-of-believable future space travel.  Then you have this kooky sea monster thing lurking in the rings of Saturn.  I'm not sure it works.  What does this thing eat, for example?   Presumably crunchy spacecraft with chewy centres haven't come along very often up until this point.  How does it propel itself?  What's the population size?  I don't want you to info-dump the answers to all these questions into the story, but I'd buy the story more if I got the feeling that you had at least worked out the answers to these questions for yourself.  Second, you're presenting this in a public space for feedback, but there are basic proofreading problems still evident.   I think that's not really a good idea: you want to give people the best possible story you can before you ask for their feedback, I think.  I'm talking about stuff like the incorrect use of a semicolon in the very first sentence.  (I'd vote for something like ""The vast  hulk of the mining survey ship John Buddle hung like a limpet in close orbit around the majestic ringed planet of Saturn."")  You list ""Mars, Cetes, and Jupiter"" when presumably you mean Ceres.  You might protest that these are small things, but when a reader runs into multiple problems like this on page 1 it gives the impression that the author didn't care about the details too much.  Also, on the subject of Mars/Ceres/Jupiter: your idea that people will advance outward through the solar system sequentially probably doesn't stack up.  In terms of delta-V, if you can send a rocket to Jupiter and slow it down when you get there, you can certainly go to Saturn.  I think the mining/colonization process you describe would be much more parallel exploitation of the various resources.  You might respond to all this with ""hey, I wasn't trying to write realistic SF in the first place.""  If so, fair enough, but maybe borrow a trick from Douglas Adams or Harry Harrison or whoever and show the reader early on that this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek fantastic yarn rather than a believable SF tale.    Whatever you decide, consider finding a way not to do ""It was the thirty-second century...""-type info-dumps at all.  The reader is smarter than you think.  Just tell the story and let them infer the background.  It's actually part of the fun of the reading experience.    And finally: have a think about how you want to deal with point-of-view in your story.  Yours opens with a POV technique that is more typical of movies than written fiction, i.e., your ""narrative camera"" starts outside the spacecraft and then moves inside for close-ups of the ship's interior and eventually the characters.  At least consider the virtues of nominating one character (presumably Zac) as your POV character and telling the story describing only what Zac experiences.  Jumping from one character's head to another can be leave the reader feeling lost."

The distance between the carriers is very spread out, the flak cannons effectively simulate CIWS, fighters and long range missles doing the majority of damage, etc. It gives a decently realistic call back to the carrier fights of WWII.  One of my biggest critiques of movies like SW is that there's no need for ships to get that close in the vastness of space - commanders are putting their vessels at an incredible amount of risk, especially given the lethality of their weapon systems."

Do we want discussion or a circle jerk? If every comment has to share the same opinion to get seen, why the hell even come to the comments?"
sciencefiction,3dudqu,0Sanctuary,3,Mon Jul 20 05:16:15 2015 UTC,"It's late and I'm jet lagged in a foreign country. So what the heck.  My landlord introduced me to the series as well as the movie. I found it was very thought provoking, but it fell short of the must-watch list for me. A lot of the uneven flaws with it could have been entirely due to the early cancellation, but perhaps not.  About half of the cast was well defined and likeable. The rest were vague and muddled, with bit parts that were hard to figure out the right response to. Does Whedon want us to accept Inara and her profession as a fully enlightened society might? If so, why the constant slut jokes from the captain, and worse still, the lingering coyness (or in one case, explicit voyeurism) when she has to get to work? Book is some sort of voice of morality, but what is our moral standard in this new universe Whedon has created? (And why did Book eventually devolve into a constant meddler and interruptor?)  River was especially egregious, as her weirdness is never fully explained but repeatedly exploited to extricate the characters from whatever plot corner they got themselves stuck in. The movie is really bad for this - the crew faces the real prospect of death, with one beloved character already eliminated - but at the eleventh hour, River once again busts loose with her ""tediously invincible psycho martial arts girl prodigy"" sequence and effortlessly saves the day. By this time, the only function this served was to cheapen the tension and sacrifice of the rest of the crew.  The captain, Mal, is wildly inconsistent in his ethical stance, ranging from spineless pushover to startling badass - apparently at the behest of whatever plot twist required his compliance that episode. This is no minor quirk - I count two episodes, and arguably the entire presence of River and Mrs. Reynolds, which constitute some species of wild goose chase that's completely dependent on his inability to say ""no"" to a nonsensical proposal.   By the events of the movie, there's a scene, long overdue, where Mal finally puts his foot down and compels the crew and passengers to follow his lead. Finally, after countless walkovers by his interfering, disrespectful, but protected-by-plot passengers and crew members, in the movie he shakes off the submissiveness that's plagued him throughout the series, and reminds them who the real leader is. Unfortunately, he does so to avenge Book, the foremost author of ""thou shalt not do whatever cool mercenary thing thou wast about to do"" all the way through the TV show.  A tighter character list, a tighter focus on plot, and a less generous attitude towards deferred revelations of mysterious character secrets, would probably have stood the series well. As it is, the episodes of outback style mercenary cargo-running are hugely enjoyable... but the series loses its way among inexplicable pointless side plots and digressions, including one episode apparently written to make the Wardrobe department feel loved and needed. The character of Jayne is especially wry - it's almost like the character signed on for a merc-soldier TV series and is visibly lost and irritated at finding himself in a jolly-crew-nursemaid dramedy, where he's the eternal bad guy.  Whedon does amazing dialogue and his characters have some shining moments in pithy lines. But nine main characters is hugely ambitious, and the truncated episodes don't help this exercise. It's uncertain whether the series would have fully realized its promise if it had run its due course. Many viewers hold that even in its truncated state, it's a masterpiece - perhaps with overreliance on the ""what-if"" aspect.  Watch it with the expectation of an ambitious, interesting show that was cut short before its conclusion."

Yes, as long as it's freely chosen and does not deprive those who choose it of their rights.  Specific to the Firefly universe: As a Companion Inara had higher social status than anyone else on the ship ever had, a wealth of training and education, and enough professional agency that she could get clients blacklisted for life for poor behaviour. There was also no indication that she worked under duress, that she couldn't leave/stop if she wanted, that she couldn't refuse a client, or that her profession was anything other than a choice she was happy to make. In short Companions were not being victimized, so there is no basis for saying it shouldn't have been acceptable.

There’s something attractive about all those people being gone, about wandering in a depopulated world, scrounging cans of Campbell’s pork and beans, defending one’s family from marauders. Sure, it’s horrible, sure we weep for all those dead people. But some secret part of us thinks it would be good to survive, to start all over.      Secretly, we know we’ll survive. All those other folks will die. That’s what after-the-bomb stories are all about.      All those after-the-bomb stories were lies. Lies, lies, lies.  This is the only true after-the-bomb story you will ever read.  Everybody dies. Your father and mother are decapitated and crushed by a falling building. Rats eat their severed heads. Your husband is disemboweled. Your wife is blinded, flashburned, and gropes along a street of cinders until fear-crazed dogs eat her alive. Your brother and sister are incinerated in their homes, their bodies turned into fine powdery ash by firestorms. Your children … ah, I’m sorry, I hate to tell you this, but your children live a long time. three eternal days. They spend those days puking their guts out, watching the flesh fall from their bodies, smelling the gangrene in their lacerated feet, and asking you why it happened. But you aren’t there to tell them. I already told you how you died.       John Varley, The Manhattan Phone Book (Abridged) (1984)"

He grabbed it with one arm….”.  It?  what did he grab?  What it?  Is the time, which was in the sentence before, or the implants?  (suggest, ‘he grabbed the figure’)  “Ally what are you doing here………..Alyssa whimpered and withdrew……” Alyssa?  Oh, it’s Ally, the same person …. (suggest, ‘his daughter whimpered and withdrew’)   “Hey, hey baby, it’s perfectly okay you just startled me.  What’s going on? Sounds unnatural, (suggest “it’s okay you just startled me”) “I can’t talk about it I’ve changed my mind. I’m sorry for waking you dad  ““No!” she jumped.  Adrian stretched a smile across his scarred face” What?  Why did she jump?  Was she thinking something?  She was speaking the sentence before. Makes no sense for her to say “No!” all of a sudden.  “Okay, I will then”  (unnatural sounding, “OK” is sufficient here)  -”are you wearing tights?”  (Adrian is saying this, it should be on it’s own line, not merged with the description of her actions )  “Amy did it and said it was super comfy……. OK, you’ve introduced the character of Amy.  The next paragraph Adrian is reflecting about Amy, his second in command, confidant, lover…..good feelings.  “I I’m still thinking about mother and Terry…….” Wait what?  Is Amy her mother?, no, she would have said Amy, So it’s a different character...OK  Then you don’t mention mother or Terry ever again.  So, what purpose did this sentence serve?  Is it a plot device  just to make Ally scared, to want to sleep in her father’s room?    What story are you telling?  Is it a day in the life of Adrian?

Most of the replies I receive are generic 'this is really good, write more!' comments.  I appreciate the line to line editing very much.  As you've seen sentence mechanics are my weakest point of writing and you're helping me out a lot.  If you could, could you add what you liked about my short (If you liked anything) so I can see what I'm doing right?  In your last paragraph you asked me what kind of story I was telling.  I'm not sure.  I put this together based on a full length novel I was writing and I guess the lack of that context shows a lot.  My main thought was to show how Adrian and Alyssa are both dealing with a lot of baggage and how they're relying on each other.  I guess I didn't quite expand on the baggage enough."
sciencefiction,3dpbg3,glucoseboy,2,Sun Jul 19 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"You are really brave for putting your work out here, on reddit for feedback.    I liked the characters very much.  The Father / daughter relationship is something we don't read very much about and I am interested in them from the onset.  There is  a lot in the story that you can explore. (stuff you've already hinted at (Aly's mother, what is the back story relationship with Adrian, who is Terry?) .    This is great!  I want to learn more about these characters.   I also liked how you used Adrian's internal thoughts to bring in the history because it allows me to see into his mind and understand what makes him, the protagonist,  tick.    Short stories are much harder than novels IMHO because you have to be so efficient in your writing, (no ""filling in a plot hole"" later).  There is hardly any space to manage multiple plot lines or explore multiple characters.   Let's do an experiment and focus just element of the story you want to tell, Adrian's baggage.  Here's what we know.  He was in the war and seen a lot of bad sh*t.   He's probably made decisions that resulted in a lot of  people dying.   Great stuff here because your readers will understand Adrian pretty easily (we've read lots of stories about similar characters).   Could the conflict and plot that the story works through be Adrian's response to Aly's request to sleep with him?    From Pixar's 20 rules of Story telling #4 https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/pixars-rules-for-great-storytelling/  Once upon a time, there was this war vet.  Every day he would try to process all the guilt and low self worth he felt from all the bad things he saw and did in the war.  One day, his daughter comes to him and asks to sleep with him in his room because she feels scared.  Because of that, he is very conflicted because of all the bad feelings he has; .

Mostly cause I haven't been able to watch about 30% of the movies listed yet(Ex Machina, Transcendence, and Her).  But it seems to me that the author is extremely biased by their own personal beliefs.  Over and over I see ""experts agree that this cannot be"".  Which I think is kind of bullshit.  Example: I, Robot  ""All the experts are quick to point out that robots do not change their programming, and the notion that they could spontaneously develop new agendas is pure fiction.""  The very nature of Artificial Intelligent would be a computer program that programs itself.  Otherwise it is just a dumb computer that performs the tasks it's given and therefore not A.I.  I specifically take issue with the supposition that A.I. cannot be the product of one person or a group of people.  It's very very likely that when Artificial intelligence comes about it will be one person or a group of people who make the final adjustment to an already existing matrix of computing language to leap the technology of A.I. from fantasy to reality.  Sure, for a long period of time there with be technologies that are close, but not quite actual Artificial Intelligence.  Real life example, I.B.M.'s Watson is very close but not really A.I. but when someone programs a true A.I. it will likely be programming that is built upon Watson.  The other thing that struck me(and really what inspired me to comment) was their opinion of Andrew's goals in Bicentennial man.  He wasn't looking to become frail or just simply human.  He sought acceptance by humanity.  Which is not only plausible but extremely likely of an artificial intelligent created by experiences with human interaction.  The part of the movie which convey's this most is when Andrew suddenly alters the way he refers to himself when released from service to his family.  He says ""I"" instead of ""One"".  Acceptance and equality is inherent in our society and any creature biological or mechanical created by us in our own image would very likely seek it.  Sorry for the rant.  But this author is spouting a lot of nonsense IMO."

I suggest you make it a homework assignment (worth marks) that your students find some images and email them to you.  Sci-fi is very popular these days and so is google image search so I think it's a good way for them to bridge their personal memories with the material."
sciencefiction,3dhyl8,K7Avenger,2,Fri Jul 17 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"I am of no help with pictures or artwork of these things but I have been binge watching old sci fi movies and a lot of them are about mars (and to top it off they are almost all on Youtube free to watch.) There were very few films dealing with space at all before 1950 and they were things like Just Imagine in the 1930's the last part of that movie they go to mars, get out and walk around breathing air and looking at vegetation. Flash Gordon goes to mars in 1938 and it is much the same then nothing really happens for a decade and suddenly there is a lot more knowledge about mars. In 1950 things sort of explode with Destination Moon(not involving mars) is an important film because it is one of the first films to try and use accurate technical detail of what was known about space travel at that time. Rocketship X-M came a few years later and is an interesting one they go to mars by accident and land and only need gas mask like apparatus in the martian atmosphere this is common in the 1950's to have minimal shielding from the environment no matter what planet they seem to be on. Flight To Mars from the same year though had them in full head gear and flight type suits if I am not mistaken. Things shifted to making movies about venus and uranus and neptune in the late 50's early 60's because people suddenly knew more about mars and the moon and what their atmospheres were really like. As people became more knowledgeable movies turned to alien worlds beyond our galaxy altogether in the mid 60's and beyond, or of martians invading us with no mention of the conditions of their home planet. But the films involving mars really kinda taper off, though Robinson Crusoe on Mars is a bit later in 1965 and by this time is much more accurate to a space suit/oxygen idea you would expect. We had successfully gotten a probe there and the era of great fantastically inaccurate martian sci-fi movies came to an end."

Even though I was totally entranced with the book, I have to say that no it's not the greatest Sc-fi book.    I wouldn't even dream of calling it Sci-fi, even SF is a stretch (speculation fiction), because it is more about the interactions between people in the microcosm of Bellona than it is about what happened to Bellona. It's about sex, gender, love, power, and mental illness.   Despite that, it's beautiful.  It's a 900 page poem.  And it's visceral descriptiveness of everything is amazing, and often disgusting and disturbing, but it always feels true.   Edit: And let's keep this in your other thread."

Delany.  I'd argue he's got the best prose/themes out of any sci fi I've ever read.

In the realm of science fiction all I can tell you is that it's the best I've ever read. That's not to say the prose isn't glorious, because it is, but consider the following:   Most of the prose in sci fi is shit, which is of course fine since conceptual/thematic content, cool ass technology and therefore moral quandaries, epic scales, etc. are all readily available.

There are some scenes in LW that contain mutated humans, but it makes sense in context with the rest of the story about the protomolecule, especially in books 2-3.  The series is about the political unrest, war, corporate power, and human struggle whilst working toward a post-scarcity, FTL society.  Book 1 is a detective story, mystery and neo-noir. Book 2 is more of a Cold War political thriller. Book 3 is a kind of haunted house story of sorts. Book 4 is more of a western. Book 5 is a story about family ties, with some post-apocalyptic elements.  Saying that The Expanse is about space zombies is like saying the film Alien is about androids, because there is an android in it."

sciencefiction,3d95vh,Lolthien,5,Tue Jul 14 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"Please take no offense, but -- if you're actually talking about ""the Bolo series"", you really, really have to go back much, much further than Weber (disclaimer, I'm a huge fan of Weber's and have read almost everything he's written).  It all got started with ""The Combat Unit"" by Keith Laumer in 1960.  There have been novels by him and novels and short stories by others, since - Weber's turn was actually pretty cool, I thought, since self-aware weapons of war is one of his favored tropes - but please give credit where credit's due.  I think a much more telling omission than leaving out the Bolos was the complete lack of mention of any Hammer's Slammers books from the list; no list of military SF can be considered complete without David Drake, really."

It uses time travel to compensate for long travel times, but humans are too delicate for the time travel trip.  I dunno, maybe I’m remembering the movie incorrectly, but a lot of those numbers seem totally arbitrary.  Huge points for measuring their relative “speeds” as acceleration."

Assuming it would, the problem seems to me that both a ""realistic-seeming"" travel time and a ""crazy fast 3 weeks travel time"" are both many, many orders of magnitude faster than any realistic travel method we know about, and only a few orders of magnitude different from each other.    I'm kind of sympathetic to the writers giving themselves a travel time that works effectively for the plot.  I mean, if it's all speculative nonsense anyway?"
sciencefiction,3clf2g,jtr99,3,Thu Jul 9 10:44:09 2015 UTC,"I just wish they were less reliant on ships being able to travel between galaxies. They already have Stargates, and there were ships to discover in the Pegasus galaxy already, so I suppose for me the ""crazy 3 weeks travel"" isn't just about it seeming far too quick as it seemed like a cheap plot device to resolve issues.  To answer your question though, yes something closer to a couple years would make me happier. I guess it was more I wanted it to feel proportional to speeds those ships had already shown capable of in terms of travelling within the Milky Way. Though, as another user mentions to me, there are at least explanations for the quick travel time being consistent within the Stargate universe.  It just seemed to me that ships got faster as the plot needed them too. It's obviously not something that ruined my enjoyment, just something that bugs me to think about."

sciencefiction,3clf2g,AvatarIII,2,Thu Jul 9 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"In Stargate cannon the way I have perceived there are two schools of thought regarding the immense speed. Either Pegasus is very close to the milky way and Earth is on the closest edge of the Milky Way to Pegasus and vise versa with Atlantis. The other option and the one I subscribe to is that it is possible to go faster in intergalactic space due to the lack of gravitational and other forms of interference.  Unfortunately, the gate bridge proves the first option incorrect because we can assume that the range of the gates are a bit larger than the diameter of the milky way and the gate bridge required 34 stargates placed somewhere near their maximum range from each other. Indicating that the gap between the milky way and the Pegasus galaxy is somewhere in the area of 34x the diameter of the milky way. Now, in the beginning Season 9 Episode 9 ""Prototype"" it is revealed that Prometheus would take two weeks to go to another location in the Milky Way. Before you say ""Prometheus is much slower than the Daedalus"" in the beginning Season 8 Episode 12 ""Prometheus Unbound"" it is revealed that it would take the same three weeks to reach Atlantis.

Doesn't change the fact not all those books hold up (The Burning Shore was a lot of fun, but the writing seems a lot weaker ten years on). It's perfectly valid line of criticism to say: ""That was a lot of fun to read but it had weaknesses in plot, structure and theme.""

In the other cases, our protagonist is very good at a game that also happens to be a simulation/recuitment tool.  He then engages in REAL combat that is very similar (or the same as) his experience in the game, only now it is real.

When I grabbed the book (based off a movie deal signing and lots of recommendations) I was expecting a commentary on the unhealthy amount of time people spend escaping into other, virtual worlds and the current obsession of romanticizing the 80's and 90's. Instead, like the reviewer wrote, Ready Player One simply reinforces the idea that it's ok to permanently hide from reality and remain close minded to any other history but your own.   It's unfortunate because the pacing in the book is really well done, and it seems like it has so much potential for more, but as it stands it has become frustrating trying to finish the last 1/4 the story."

sciencefiction,3cfjxe,BuccaneerRex,2,Tue Jul 7 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"I think we're just getting spoonfed what Drill is capable of. It's surprisingly coincidental that all of the main character's children are playing Drill's game. It can be one of only three reasons. First, that the children were targeted because of who their parents are. Supporting evidence is the kid who blew up his mom's office, kid who got on daddy's computer, etc. Second option is that all kids are potential targets and Drill has not activated all children everywhere. Not much to support this one, but I don't think the mom in the treehouse was anyone too special, she's just a foil for Blonde FBI. Third option is that the show's just not written well, and I'm on the fence about this one. I pretty much can't stand anyone in the show, nobody has made any intelligent decisions, and I am rooting for Drill at this point as the only interesting character.  Also, I don't think Peter Petrelli is following Drill's orders. It seems more like he's tuned in to Drill's frequency and is trying to prevent Drill from causing trouble.  It's early days yet, and I'm always reluctant to get into a show before its second season is confirmed. I've been burned before. I haven't decided if I like Whispers yet. It needs to tighten up the script, and give me a little more than adultery drama if it's going to keep me watching. The only thing I've seen so far that seems science-fiction is the weird tree thing in Africa that ate the plane.

sciencefiction,3canxu,grumbel,13,Mon Jul 6 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"The movie definitely showed that it didn't work. The system was abused and manipulated to enable exactly what it was meant to stop.   Even the good guys in the system were to deep into it and to personally flawed to offer any protection.   The existence of a minority report was also technical evidence that it was unreliable. Even a perfect prediction of 3/3 could be flawed when you consider adding a fourth precog. How many precogs does it take for absolute certainty? 4/5? 99/100?   And this isn't even touching the conditions of the precogs themselves... They're people, too."
sciencefiction,3canxu,stevarino,5,Mon Jul 6 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"The movie literally opens with a murder-in-progress being stopped thanks to the precogs.  The issue is not that pre-crime in general didn't work, but that their specific implementation of pre-crime was flawed. If the pre-crime program instead stopped people once they had crossed the threshold of ""attempted murder"" there would be no legal questions involved, because the actual criminal act would have happened, and there would be no question about whether someone is culpable for an act which hasn't happened.  I mean ... we already have attempted murder in the real world, and I think it's relatively uncontroversial. If the pre-criminals are only charged under existing laws regarding attempted murder (that is, only once they've taken some concrete step towards committing murder) then the precogs aren't acting as much more than an advanced and relatively error-free surveillance system which doesn't meaningfully infringe on privacy.  (There's an ethical question of using mentally-handicapped people stuck in tanks. But if the question is just ""should we use precognition to assist in police work"" then I think the answer is pretty obviously ""yes, just not in the same way that they do it in the movie"".)"
sciencefiction,3canxu,alexanderwales,5,Mon Jul 6 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"The precogs in the story were just a dues ex right?  I mean, the technical shit about them and how many was just to rationalize it a bit so that their magic precognitive abilities fit in the scifi setting.  I saw it more as standard ""who watches the watchmen"" themed story.  You had an ""infalable"" system, but that only works if you have infalable people running it top to bottom.  That's impossible so the whole things falls apart.  That part I think we're in agreement with.  The detail of the precogs was just a relatively arbitrary detail I thought."

If the story differs significantly I would love to hear it. (for example Do Androids Dream blew me away while Blade Runner was not as philosophically sharp)  What I took from the movie is that the precogs' backstory is basically deus ex machina. But their fallibility and inability to audit is a critical element of the story. Also there are a few moments with Agatha that I felt were designed to show her as a very tortured person rather than a flat plot device.  But I agree with your watchmen take, I just think that it goes further than the procedural system all the way to the usage of the precogs themselves for the reasons cited above."

That doesn't show that the system doesn't work, but that it isn't bullet proof against inside interference. That's what I would consider a minor issue that could be addressed with some more internal auditing and surveillance.   How many precogs does it take for absolute certainty?    Why bother with absolute certainty? Our current legal system doesn't bother with absolute certainty either. As far as I remember the movie didn't show any instances of PreCrime actually being wrong. Quite the opposite, the movie tells us that PreCrime has succeeded in reducing the city's murder rate to zero and a lot of murderer-catching seems to happen only moments before the murder happens, thus the false-positive rate had to be rather low, if it existed at all.   And this isn't even touching the conditions of the precogs themselves... They're people, too.   Three people seem like a small price to pay for solving all murder. You could also just pay them well and give them a vacation every now and then if you have to. Not a great reason to shutdown the project for good."

That he fully and completely intended to execute a man.  That is what was predicted.  He chose not to Part 1 Part 2.  His choice stopped him from executing a man.  The man died, yes, but it was due to a struggle after the fact, an accidental homicide, not on purpose.  Precrime did not intervene.  It is, by definition, a false prediction.  The man literally shot himself, after the time given.  Everyone has a choice.  Every moment, it begins with the choices made."

That's why Precrime can work in the first place and prevent all the murder before they happen. That's not an indication that the system doesn't work, just that you need to take better care of it and not have agents hide away evidence.

The area is however enchanted - if you walk in from the East, the Kingdoms proper, you get smaller. Or conversely the forest gets bigger. There is no known way to cross the Lenrira laterally, a voyage from one side to the other would take aeons.   Lenrira allows for some interactive species to leave through several means. That's why the last century there has been a steady influx of giant intelligent woodland animals. Some of these would be played as characters (even though I don't RP), think hobbit sized humanoid cats, mice, squirrels.   Lenrira is created but the Kingdoms does not know for certain by who or what. On various borders east, west, south and north the Kingdoms are strange phenomenon - a giant swirling vortex to the east, impenetrable mountain walls to the southeast, a forbidding nexus of feng shui leylines in the sea to the south, dragons in the northern mountains and assorted strange phenomenon. The goal of these effects seems to be containment - the human Kingdom has doubled in size and is tenfold in population compared to two centuries ago. The Kingdom is in a Malthusian trap - expand or suffer massive civil wars.   It's the Alalvarites. Staunch conservatives who use feudal magic to strengthen traditional roles. Pregnancies reduced to half usual months, easily several children per litter and a fertile age from 12 to 45, where Orthodox Alalvarite women can have a pregnancy at a rate of one per year. They are steering towards Theocracy, and the other ethnic and religious groups are powerless to stop them."

This sets in motion the creation of the Humanx Commonwealth; the political body that is the union of human and thranx society which forms the foundation for many of Foster's science-fiction novels.  Nor Crystal Tears is written from the perspective of the Thranx and the cultural lens through which they encounter the monstrous, fleshy alien mammals known as humans. A primary theme is the paranoia and fear the two vastly different races naturally have for each other upon first contact, but also how individuals are able to overcome these innate fears and prejudices and set in motion the foundation for what would become Foster's Humanx Commonwealth.  Foster would further expand on this theme, using another (unrelated) alien race, the furry Quozl in their eponymous novel.

The book isn't great because of a gimmick, even though that gimmick is quite the thought provoker. The book is great because it is well written and straight up fantastic science fiction. Well developed characters? Check. World/culture building? Check. Interesting and surprising plot? Check.  Edit:  I fell into the trap of calling it a gimmick, when I think it is really a interesting part of the culture of the book.  IMO it isn't a gimmick at all."

I picked it up for the gimmick, but bought the rest of the series because it blew my mind.  The way the author portrays One Esk's hive-mind nature was fantastic. Easily one of the best books I've ever read.  It is a little sad to see the ""puppies"" comments in the article regarding Ancillary Justice. It's made worse by the fact that he has a point buried under all of that vitriol.

World/culture building? Check. Interesting and surprising plot? Check.   But is there anything else? I am yet to read it and I am a bit cautious precisely because of how much noise was being made about the idiotic politically correct gimmick. The worrying thing is that the book got so much recognition precisely for that gimmick and not for the other qualities. And probably this was one of the last straws for people such as Sad Puppies (Or perhaps Brandon Sanderson got angry because he couldn't get the ticked on the back of Robert Jordan???) - because it angered  me too. But then again the Hugo might have been deserved if the competition was not up to the task. I haven't read any of the other books either.  But it was the general trend among publishers, SJW-like editors of media and internet-folk in general - that they pressed with ""OMG so progressive"" nonsense when a much more coherent and intriguing use of non-gender pronouns can be found in a truly mind-blowing novel - Diaspora by Greg Egan written in 1997.  Almost two decades before Leckie came up with her idea.  And I am not convinced even Egan was the originator here - though he makes a great case for internal logic and consistency in the book."
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,pharmaceus,2,Wed Jul 1 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"idiotic politically correct gimmick   This is pretty much the exact attitude I was mentioning.  Your comment is exactly what I am pushing back against.  You mention that you haven't even read the book (nor the second), then call it out as idiotic and politically correct based on some sort of culture-war group think.  Having read both of the books in the series, I can tell you that the 'gimmick' is very well done, but is totally not what the book is about, although it is a core part of the world building and cultural setting.  Beyond that, Leckie doesn't really spend any time espousing any types of political statements that I could tell.   The worrying thing is that the book got so much recognition precisely for that gimmick and not for the other qualities.   What does that have to do with the quality of the book?  It is a fantastic book.  The 'gimmick' really is a core but unobtrusive part of the world which Lecke builds.   a much more coherent and intriguing use of non-gender pronouns can be found in a truly mind-blowing novel - Diaspora by Greg Egan written in 1997.   How do you know it is more coherent if you haven't read both?  Beyond that, almost every idea you have ever seen in culture has been done before.  That isn't an original observation.  It was old when John Lennon talked about it 40 years ago.  The question is, does Lecke do a good job with her use of this as a writing tool?  My answer is an emphatic yes.  Unlike you, I will not compare to Diaspora because I haven't read it (but it just went on my list).  As I was writing this response I was tempted to recommend you actually read the book.  I wonder if that isn't the right recommendation for you.  You seem like that type of reader that has to bring their own 'culture war' baggage to any conversation or experience.  You seem to have already decided you hate the book without reading a single word of it.  You might just avoid it and go on with your life.  There is plenty of other science fiction out there.  All I can say is that Anne Leckie has create to well-written books that have everything I yearn for in great science fiction."
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,joejance,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"Then I recommend you don't push back. Because you have no idea what you're talking about.  For your benefit however I'll explain:  I am not criticizing the use of feminine pronouns in the book. The writer is a woman - it's the most natural thing to do for her if she wanted to try something new. I have no idea whether she tries to push a political agenda, share her own opinions and views or just does if for the fun of it. I don't care. She is the writer - she has all the right in the world to do whatever she wants. I'll be the judge of that when I read the book. If I like it then I like it. If I find it to be a clumsy attempt at being ""edgy"" then I don't like it and at worst ... never read the book again.  However I am criticizing editors, publishers, media people and reviewers and everyone else on the Internet who immediately threw away any other qualities the book might have and simply went ""the main character doesn't recognize gender and therefore everyone is referred to as female"" - end of review/opinion/recommendation/blurb since apparently everything else is of secondary importance.  I was criticizing a marketing gimmick used to promote the book   If that gimmick isn't pandering to a prevailing politically correct paradigm then I recommend a long vacation somewhere far away (and nice) and then a couple of visits to a therapist because you're confused about the world.  As a matter of fact I have to admit I haven't read a single review by another author who would make this the main focus - since they tend to be people who pay attention to characters, narratives, storylines, settings etc. rather than abusing tumblr-like mentality to sell more copies.    Greg Egan is more coherent than Leckie because she only twists around the perspective on a single character. Egan comes up with a whole setting where it is culturally relevant to do so - not only in terms ""look it's a female-only society"" but in terms of why and how it works for technically anyone. It's not a judgement on what works better - it's just that if you want to use a book to emphasize certain culturally progressive themes then Egan makes more sense because it's not a single character out of place but a whole world built around the notion of genderlessness and in 1997.  If you haven't read Diaspora I strongly recommend. Probably the most complete work of Egan's where ideas are concerned and is one of the most astounding works of hard sci-fi. Not a whole lot of fun and action but as food for thought - certainly."
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,pharmaceus,23,Thu Jul 2 04:09:47 2015 UTC,I honestly thought the Puppies were trying to show how stupid the awards were by voting for garbage books. I didn't know they actually thought the stories they were putting forward were quality.
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,AtlanticSlim,7,Tue Jun 30 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think there's a distinction between books that blow my mind with a new concept and books that are entertaining.  I've read Correia's Monster Hunter series and it's great fun - I don't think it's garbage at all.  But it doesn't make me think about things in a new light or make me think more deeply about the future directions science could take.  It's just great fun top read and reads a bit like watching a good movie or TV show... in fact, I think it would make a great TV show.  The series is exactly the type of books that I would read by the pool on vacation, but it's exactly the type of books that I would struggle to remember the plot of in a year or two.  They aren't in any way garbage - I love reading them - but they aren't, in my humble opinion, the kind of books that you would give a literary award to.  It sounds like the goal of the Puppies is to show that the awards are more about highlighting books that illustrate a social justice agenda rather than picking good stories, and if so, that's something that hadn't crossed my mind.  I just like good sci-fi/fantasy stories, and I don't care if they pursue a social justice angle or not.  I thought the linked page was insightful.  I didn't know anything about any of this.  Every year I browse through the nominations and what won the award, go to Amazon and buy the ones that seem to appeal and generally I tend to like whatever books get nominated but not always.  And when I don't, I shrug and move on.  I've never heard any of the drama that goes on behind the scenes and, while it's interesting, I'm not sure it affects my view of the Hugo awards.  I'll likely keep doing what I'm doing but it was neat to read that there's a lot more drama in what happens with the Hugo's than in some of the books that are nominated."

sciencefiction,3bnh5s,rvncto,5,Tue Jun 30 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I could ELI30 it.  I barely understand it myself - like I said, my clicking on the link was the first I'd heard of it.  But it seems to be that there is a movement - called the Puppies (prefixed with either ""sad"" or ""rabid"" or maybe there's two entirely different groups) - who are using the nomination process of the Hugo's to either protest the Hugo's literary snobbery or else a move of the Awards towards political correctness.  I can't quite figure out which of these two are being protested against, or maybe it's both.  This post in the linked article seemed to clarify the position a bit: But she [Seanan McGuire] is popular with the [Secret Masters of Fandom], ergo she is nominated. You preach the right kind of message fic, you can get nominated. You get popular with the right crowd, you can get nominated. If you are popular enough with the right crowd the Hugos will even tweak which category you fit in so that their two favorites don’t have to go head to head and both can win Hugos.  which reads to me like ""the whole process is skewed towards selecting books that are the type of books that the old school Hugo people like"".  I might argue that this is true of any kind of award - the whole process is skewed to award awards to the type of things that the judges like.  My father owns a winery and he can go off on a rant that the Wine Spectator awards top points to a particular style of wine and that this style isn't what my father likes to produce so he will never do well in the Spectator awarding process.  This seems to be a general problem with democracy, or maybe with humankind who have a particular problem with objectivity, particularly when it comes to art in any of it's forms."
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:19 2015 UTC,haha thanks for trying.  thats about what i got out of it as well.   but i couldn't really tell who the bad guys were.   like founder of puppies are racist or mysogonistic but they nominate progressive books? so we should be for or against?   the wine spectator anecdote was interesting too.
sciencefiction,3bnh5s,rvncto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"It unfortunately depends on your perspective.  Those in the Puppies camp see a particular portion of SF fandom as the bad guys (and io9 is really a strong part of this perception), the sff fandom not only sees the Puppies (as a collective), as bad guys for supposedly ruining their award and for being racist sexist whatevers, and anyone who isn't a Rabid Puppy agrees that the Rabid Puppies are bad guys no matter how you feel about the Puppies campaign or the social justice influence on fandom.  The reality is definitely more complicated.  There is a lot of supporting evidence for the Puppies claims (that this dumb, dumb io9 article didn't spend any time on ""If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love"" or on Kameron Hurley's hateful essay or on the Mad Norwegian fan books is a demonstration, to me, that this was not designed to help anyone ""understand"" the issue except to further advance the social justice side's narrative), but a lot in the way of questionable claims from the Puppies side as well.  Truly, fandom has become insular in the last decade.  The internet polarizes ideologies, and fandom has not been immune to it.  As a conservative, I certainly feel like there's been less room at the table for me solely due to what I believe, and there are scores of people who would probably write great stories in the genre and are not because they feel it would be a losing battle.  I don't love what the Greater Puppies have done this year, but I also don't love what's happened to sff fandom, either, and that falls right on the shoulders of Scalzi, of Hurley, of io9, of Jemisin, and so on.  You kind of have to expect this sort of pushback when the sort of intolerance they espouse comes into play."

They can't distinguish between what they like and quality, so they claim when anything they don't like is recognized, it's some leftist conspiracy. It's not really clear if they really believe the stuff they say or whether they're just trolling.

sciencefiction,3bnh5s,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"So tl;dr a bunch of 4channers/angry old men/MRAs want to take Hugo awards from being a quality recommendation, to who can write popular action books.  I probably don't invest as much time in reading as I should and I'm sure many are great books, but stuff like Jurrasic (an action filled screenplay) park can't really be winning the same prize as Dune and Foundation's Edge, which may not be as action pact but make you think about real life.  IMHO   Science fiction is an existential metaphor, that allows us to tell stories about the human condition. Isaac Asimov once said: ""Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation, if we are to be saved at all.""   And these 'Sad puppies' can be summed up by another Azimov quote   The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ""my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."""

IMHO, the Puppies are trying to wage a culture war instead of just participating.   One of the Puppies even cited an excellent essay in praise of pulp by Kristine Katherine Rusch Barbarian Confessions. However, instead of following her advice to read whatever the hell we enjoy, they decided to wage a culture war.

sciencefiction,3bnh5s,ccmulligan,0,Wed Jul 1 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"There is no deliberate attempt to unmask anything here. Sad Puppies are the equivalent of Social Justice Warriors from tumblr -  losers who either have no talent or discipline to produce quality novels so they resort to name-calling and faking a problem to get what they ""deserve"" without doing any honest work. OMG I have so many subscribers (readers) why nobody wants to recognize me for the genius I am.  That's the logic.   It's absolutely hilarious that those pathetic bitches act ""tough"" (since they are all conservative-gung-ho-whatever tough manly men) and yet resort to passive agressive, hissy-fit-throwing and shit-flinging when they can't get their way.  I could agree that there is overt agenda pushing (there is on towards ""left"" - but mostly because of preferences among people involved)  if there  was one book which floor everyone with its quality and would go totally unrecognized because of ""the agenda"". Like for example if Neal Stephenson doesn't get nominated next year for SevenEves - which has some very strong non-SJW/progressive undertones as most of his writing -  I could understand someone's complaint about agendas and dark communist conspiracies. But there it is: Stephenson is nominated with every major book such as Anathem and Cryptonomicon  and has a Hugo for Diamond Age. So where are your Hugos and nominations Sad Puppies? There are none because you are a bunch of talentless hacks and attention whores.   Go f**** yourselves with a bunch of sharp sticks!  Oh...

The politics, economy, and environment is going to shite so that's whats in the concious mind and what people are writing stories based on. It feels like the end of Tommorrow Land where you learn that humanity is just stuck in a rut of seeing the worst and predicting the worst instead of dreaming and thinking of how to make it better."

One one side having more diversity is good. while on the other side there is the feeling that some books (and movies,shows, games) get awards just because they are more diverse or have something that represents a social problem. Like right now in the SW EU im trying to decide if the new inclusion of women and lgbt members into the empire is a good story move or just a way to say ""hey were progressive (even though we gave them roles in the evil empire) come read us"""

Some people need to learn that they are not the only demographic looking to be entertained.  Another notable group ranting about conspiracies to force progressive values on a silent and conservative majority are the batshit religious lunatics who think the world will end if gay people in their country are allowed the same tax benefits they get.

sciencefiction,3bleuf,yorksdude,12,Tue Jun 30 08:28:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, even though the practical effects were impressive, I was not particularily blown away by it. Rather mediocre and not really innovative. One of the many reasons why sequels like Aliens and Judgement Day worked was the willingness to take the premise and do something new, something I miss in all these Pre/Se/Sidequels.   But hey, to each their own."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,Mr_Noyes,9,Tue Jun 30 08:34:33 2015 UTC,"Judgement Day is great, generally better than Rise, but I don't think you could describe the plot of Rise as mediocre - they were brave enough to make it the Terminator episode that has the humans losing to the machines.  A weaker director might have just made it as a third terminator film where the humans won."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,yorksdude,3,Tue Jun 30 08:47:25 2015 UTC,"Funny, I initially wanted to mention the ending of Rise because of just that but forgot to. Yes, I'll give you that, the ending was brave but still, the overall story imho was rather bland."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,Mr_Noyes,2,Tue Jun 30 09:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I were just reading the plot, I might say it was good, but the movie was full of hammy, quippy bullshit that ruined any good qualities it might have had. In Terminator 2, everything had a reason, the quips the t100 made, he learned organically. In T3, he was apparently programmed to just make shitty jokes constantly."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,Naught,7,Tue Jun 30 14:13:00 2015 UTC,"I also enjoyed that film.  At least it was rated R.  This ""PG-13ification"" of movies just to sell more tickets, sucks.

sciencefiction,3bleuf,Veneroso,4,Tue Jun 30 08:37:42 2015 UTC,"I saw T3 in the theatres, and I enjoyed it. Obviously not as good as the previous two, but overall an enjoyable episode in the series that seemed to fit in with the other two.   Salvation, apart from some cool special effects, was an abomination. Didn't feel like a Terminator movie at all, you could have changed around a few things and made it into just about any post apocalyptic thriller. And Sam Worthington was a plague on movies that I'm happy to see gone."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,goluphi,4,Tue Jun 30 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"T3 was friggin awesome.  I saw it in the theatre too.  Was it T2 awesome?  No.  But it fit pretty well in the storyline for me, even John Connor seemed believable if you consider who they picked to play his younger version.    Salvation, I saw in the theatre too.  Almost none of the film was shot at night.  In every single other movie you see battlefields of crushed debris and human skeletons.  There weren't any plasma rifles or anything that made the movie seem futuristic.  Like you said, just a typical post-apocalyptic setting - which looked like a regular desert.  It was obscenely loud and while it did have it's moments, didn't deliver.  I guess that they had originally planned to have Connor die and put his skin on the terminator character.  Sadly, that never happened.  Instead we get a heart transplant from a random guy without concern of blood type or tissue rejection.   -- edit --  Just a quick note on T3.  The T-X was a bit over the top.  Being able to control cars that aren't self-driving was a bit unrealistic.  If the movie was set 10 years from now when skynet google takes over the world with it's mind control augmented reality glasses and terminators self-driving cars, it would have been a real nightmare.  That being said, who sees a Terminator movie for realism anyway?"
sciencefiction,3bleuf,Veneroso,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"Ya, the T-X was a bit over the top, but if didn't kill the movie for me. Also, many cars today (and even back then) are ""drive by wire,"" the pedals, steering wheel, etc in the car are not a mechanical connect, they're hooked into the computer, which reads your input and ultimately transmits that data to the rest of the car to tell it what to do. So, if you took over that computer, you could do what the T-X did, car doesn't have to be self driving.   Anyway, I think you hit the nail on the head with what bugged me about Salvation. Too bright and no plasma rifles. Didn't look like a fleshed out version of the bits we saw in the previous Terminator movies. Also, I think, things felt too easy for the humans, they seemed too safe and well equipped."
sciencefiction,3bleuf,goluphi,2,Tue Jun 30 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah - Skynet had dominion over everything.  The humans were fighting for scraps.  There were wide areas where the humans had almost free-reign.  I mean, I think they would have noticed a mine field and a lot of soldiers...."

If you're spending 1200 words to tell a story, don't let the first 150 of those words be world-building. You're gambling that the reader loves hearing about those details so much that they'll hang in until you get to the action.  Second, if you have to start Track 2 with:   Ok, re-reading that first chapter, I think you might have a few questions. Some of them being “Who is this guy telling this story?” “What is this place?” “Is he some kind of spy? If so, who’s he spying for?” Well, I apologize for that, and I guess I can answer now.   Stop now. Go back, write that prologue in such a way that I'm not asking those questions. If you have to start out by apologizing for confusing me, you aren't coming across as genuine or down-to-earth, you're coming across as obnoxious. As a reader, I don't want to have to wonder!

sciencefiction,3bejch,stegosaurus94,16,Sun Jun 28 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"The problem for me is that I'm starting to get very super-heroed out at the moment. When Heroes originally aired, it was just on the cusp of the super hero age, and it had a bit of a different take on the classic Marvel or DC origin story, so it was kind of edgy and fresh. Now when 4/5 movies and tv shows are super hero shows, it's just another one in a long line, and another reboot at that. Can't say I'm super excited"
sciencefiction,3bejch,Ch3t,8,Sun Jun 28 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you.   I watch Arrow, The Flash, Agents of Shield, Agent Carter, and Daredevil.  Then we have the Avengers, Antman, and Fantastic Four movies.  Super Girl is coming to TV.  Netflix has Jessica Jones, Luke Cage (typed Nick Cage and then fixed it), and the Defenders coming soon.  I thought the zombie thing was getting over saturated with Z-nation and iZombie.  Even throwing in Fear the Walking Dead doesn't compare to the number of super hero shows.   I just wish they had some of these when I kid when I could have really appreciated it.  All we had then were the Electric Company Spiderman and the Fugitive, I mean the Incredible Hulk. Maybe SyFy will bring back Alphas."
sciencefiction,3bejch,Miv333,3,Sun Jun 28 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I can't really agree. I like all of the Hero shows that have been coming out. Daredevil wasn't really my taste, but it was still enjoyable. Fantastic Four is getting a lot of hate, and it's probably warranted, but I'm sure it'll be watchable. Other than that, I say bring it on. The main thing about DC and Marvel is that they all tie into each other, that's amazing. I just wish there would be more X-men.  Also, it'd be great if Alphas comes back. I just generally don't like reboots all that much because all or most of the cast is gone because they aged or don't want to re-sign. I'm excited for Heroes: Reborn, and it's awesome that Noah and Hiro are in it, but I didn't see any hint of much of the other main cast and the cast was more than half the reason I liked Heroes."

It just seemed stupid cheesy even though the sort of look and feel seems familiar for what I remember from Heroes. What you say sounds right on the money for why that is, I think I've just been spoiled on really good and interesting takes on comic style superheroes in the time since I stopped watching the show. Going back to Heroes just feels like taking a step backward when there are television shows and movies now that are not only doing what Heroes did but are also doing it better.  I have to admit though that I got a little excited seeing Bennet."

They've got two cards left to play so maybe something will come of it if they don't force their female characters to collapse into puddles of hormones every other episode in the future. I expect the twist is going to make me groan when it's revealed.  Not as good as Wayward Pines or The Event but lots better than the Last Man on Earth. Maybe it's on the level of Defiance."

The first season of the original series is the best, and it's the best because it focuses on ordinary people whose abilities upset their lives, much like how the first couple of seasons of Lost were so good because they were all ordinary people (at least on the surface) who were thrown onto the extraordinary island. We see ourselves reflected in the characters and sympathize with them because A) they're normal, B) they're well-written and C) their actors do a good job of conveying both.  Heroes lost appeal when it started to go up its own butt and focused on its own plot at the expense of the characters who drove it. I hope they remember that for the miniseries."
sciencefiction,3bejch,Dunos,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"Hero's was a prime example of what I call the Leveling effect. The more powerful a character got, the more character flaws were introduced. Characters with phenomenally powerful abilities had to either become evil (Sylar, Arthur, electric girl) or be incompetent/emotionally unstable (Hiro, Peter). Then, when they wanted to flesh out the powerful characters and actually make them likable they had to take away their super powers. I guess it might be impossible to create compelling story problems when your main character can stop time and teleport anywhere he wants, but it always seemed like kinda bad writing."

Story was indeed a wizard banishing a dragon sent to attack his side during a war, and it reappearing in our universe. I remember at one point the fighters canopy being burned opaque by dragon fire and the pilot had to jettison part of it to be able to see.   It might have been Asimov's magazine also, I remember it was one of those small format science fiction magazines, about the same size as a dvd cover if that helps.

Sunshine is an incredible film, probably a bit more psychologically intense.  In the end, I'd recommend watching both (plus The Machine)."

Primer/Upstream Color: I think Shane Caruth is just awesome, and makes awesome, thought provoking movies. They don't spell out anything and force the audience to engage, pay attention, and rewatch. Primer is hands down my favorite time travel movie ever. It was made on an almost nothing budget which makes it all the more impressive. Upstream color is beautiful,  unsettling, and fragmented, all completely on purpose. Both of these will leave you thinking for days/weeks to follow. These are probably the most ""artsy"" of this list.   Under the Skin: Deliberately paced, no exposition, we follow around an alien who has taken on the appearance of a seductive female seducing/capturing random men. Does a great job giving the watcher the cold, detached feeling of observing the human race fron the vantage point of an alien intelligence.   Coherence: Friends at a dinner party experience some rapidly escalating time looping madness as a comet passes overhead.  What all these have in common is that they make you think, and (imo) really make excellent, original use of the sci-fi genre to make brilliant, thought provoking films. You as the audience are not hand-held and spoon fed explanation for every plot point. There are questions, implications and interpretations, to be chewed over long after the credits roll. Enjoy."

I haven't seen ""Ex Machina"" yet and don't know if it's still playing in any theaters,  and I don't believe it's made it to home video yet, so ""Sunshine"" is probably the choice with the easiest access at the moment, for what it's worth."

I had much the same Reaction to this film as the film the day after tomorrow.

Pretty slow and contemplative, so best watched on a big screen in the dark without distractions.  What special effects there are are well done, but mainly the movie simply skips by such things and concentrates on the psychological drama.  Its a very close relative of Ex Machina IMO, both have themes of profoundly alien intellects interacting with humanity."

sciencefiction,3b4j0r,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Fri Jun 26 05:13:46 2015 UTC,"How about anime?  Aldnoah.Zero follows an alternate history timeline where, when humanity landed on the moon, astronauts discovered an alien moon base that contained a warp gate to mars.  The explorers who went through the gate discovered mars devoid of life, but full of amazing alien technology.  For a time this was shared with the people of earth. But soon the settlers felt that as the new inhabitants of mars, the tech belonged to them.   This led to war between the two planets which, at the start of the show, has been paused with an uneasy ceasefire for about 15 years.  After the martian princess (The granddaughter of the first man through the portal and who's bloodline is required to activate any of this martian tech) is assassinated while on a peace mission to earth, the war kicks back into high gear.  This show has great music and visual effects, as well as some truly creative battles. Unfortunately most of the characters are one-dimensional and poorly written.  Another option would be Space Battleship Yamato 2199.  In this anime, humanity was at the cusp of true space travel. We had outposts on mars and a couple of jupiter's moons, and then the Gamilas appeared from outside the solar system and attacked.  Their technology was advanced so far beyond ours that fighting us was a joke to them. After they destroyed every ship we had they settled into a base on pluto and proceeded to launch radioactive asteroids at the earth.  Humanity was forced underground to survive, but supplies are running out.  Then we're contacted by another alien race from a planet called Iscandar. They claim to have a device that will defeat the Gamilas and restore the earth to a habitable state.  The bad news is that they won't just give it to us. We need to go to them and collect it. And they're 148,000 light-years away. The good news is that they gave us plans for a hyperdrive.  This show is classic space opera. If you're a fan of Battlestar, Lost in Space, or Star Wars then I highly recommend checking it out.  The original was made in the 1970s, and while it's aged well it has gotten a bit dated. I've never seen it in anything better than a grainy VHS rip. A remake was done in 2013 which managed to keep all the retro feel while beautifully updating the artwork, so look for this version if you decide to watch it."

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,gophercuresself,2,Thu Jun 25 13:50:28 2015 UTC,The first couple of episodes of Humans have been really good so look forward to that one.   As an aside I think it's fairly funny that people are calling it AMC's Humans considering it's made in the UK by a British production company with an almost completely British cast. It would be like me calling it Sky Atlantic's Game of Thrones.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,roninjedi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"It's just a reference to where it is airing in the U.S.  And AMC did actually partner with Channel 4 on the show, so they are part owners."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,Ne007,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:29:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I know it's somewhat of a co-production it just seems slightly odd to use AMC as a prefix as it doesn't feel like any AMC show I've seen.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,gophercuresself,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:16:06 2015 UTC,I'm surprised nobody ever compares this show to Red Dwarf. It has such a similar feel and premise - misfits lost in space with charmingly crappy production values - and uses almost exactly the same character types. Maybe the target audience for Other Space isn't old enough to have seen Red Dwarf. Both are really fun shows BTW.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,MyUserNameTaken,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:25:58 2015 UTC,Spot on! Admittedly Stewart isn't quite as straight or lackadaisical as Lister. Kent is definitely Kryten. I'd say ART and  Zalien combined are sort of like the cat and Tina is Kristine Kochanski. Not sure about Michael though - maybe Dwayne Dibley at a push.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,rekjensen,2,Thu Jun 25 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"I'd actually love a proper cyberpunk TV Show, maybe like a modern reboot of Max Headroom or a retrofuturistic cyberpunk with 80s tech and style.  That said, I'd love it if they had new Star Trek & Stargate series on Netflix or Hulu that blends the quirky, optimistic style with just a tid bit of dark elements, sort of like a modern superhero film."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,yngwin,2,Thu Jun 25 00:01:44 2015 UTC,Oddly might I suggest Dollhouse?  It won't fill the dark and gritty cyber punk need but there is some good sci fi in there.  I would suggest getting to the Man on the Street episode.  Fox made them do a bunch of off story line episodes to draw normal viewers in.  Once you get past them the ideas are great.

Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when a mysterious anarchist recruits Elliot, who suffers from a severe case of social anxiety disorder but connects to people by hacking them. The show follows his attempts to recruit him to destroy the corporation he is paid to protect. Compelled by his personal beliefs, Elliot struggles to resist the chance to take down the multinational CEOs that are running (and ruining) the world."

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,PlumberODeth,5,Wed Jun 24 19:16:11 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I'm rewatching stargate sg1 at the moment and I've been shocked to realize there are episodes in season 5 that I've never seen before.  It's such a treat to have new stargate!
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,pyrespirit,4,Wed Jun 24 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"Not me. SGU abandoned everything that made SG-1 and, to a lesser extent, Atlantis excellent shows.  It ditched the quirky, self-deprecating good-nature of the show to try and cash in on edgy drama.  Definitely not a worthy addition to the Stargate IP."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,csbob2010,5,Wed Jun 24 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"It took the over dramatic parts of Battlestar Galactica and spliced it into the SG1 universe.  I liked the concept of the show but will admit to fast forwarding through lots of parts where it was just overblown hysteria or exaggerated melodrama just so I could let the story advance.  It took an hour long show and reduced it to about 20 minutes, however."

It made no sense that 3/4 of those characters were even on the initial installation. It would only be scientist, engineers, and highly trained ( not the ones they had) security. Well over half the characters were completely incompetent or useless, especially their 'security' personnel.   They had like 1 scientist and 1 naive amateur wonder boy who did everything, everyone else was just there. You don't get onto a secret stargate installation without being top tier in your field."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,csbob2010,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:37:55 2015 UTC,"Well, they did have one use.  Drama fodder.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,moonhexx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"That was like the fourth or fifth off planet installation for earth, secret or not.  Plus an entire new space fleet.  They had to be running thin on the top guy in each field at that point."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,pyrespirit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:42:49 2015 UTC,It was a unique stargate installation if I remember correctly. They were trying to figure out how to tap into the planets core to dial a ninth chevron to go farther than ever. It wasn't just another base.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,moonhexx,3,Thu Jun 25 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think that's what I liked about it actually. I rarely watch tv, but I liked how they took the SG IP and made it more serious in a sense. I'm not saying it was a perfect show, but the story idea was great imo. And some of the characters I actually cared about."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,MyUserNameTaken,5,Wed Jun 24 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"SG-1 had plenty of serious situations, but it kept a sense of whimsy which made the characters feel real: dramatized, certainly, but still real.  SGU took itself too seriously and drained all the fun out of the IP."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,yngwin,4,Wed Jun 24 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"Eh. To each their own. But I thought it was great. I personally don't want whimsy on a one way flight through galaxies.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Wed Jun 24 21:05:45 2015 UTC,They followed the new drama trend.  They did go a bit over board into the teen mellow drama department.    I will say out of all the space exploration show SGU has THE best time loop episode.  That episode was just pure fun for me.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,yngwin,2,Thu Jun 25 02:55:54 2015 UTC,They should reboot that instead of doing the silly Dark Matter.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,TheDudeNeverBowls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:52:35 2015 UTC,Dark Matter is low budget scifi action. It has its place.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,RupeThereItIs,3,Wed Jun 24 16:06:39 2015 UTC,I see it getting canceled.... it's quite a struggle to watch.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,DarthSatoris,2,Wed Jun 24 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"We only have two episodes to go on, folks. Don't throw in the towel just yet.  Stargate SG-1 took almost 2 seasons to find its footing, and since Dark Matter is made by the same people, I imagine it's going to be similar."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,Leigh_Wright,2,Wed Jun 24 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"The pilot to SG1 (first 2 episodes) was MUCH more watchable then the first episode of Dark Matter (I've not managed to watch the second episode).  SG1, even before it found it's feet, was pretty solid. Dark Mater, it's just... not good."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,RupeThereItIs,2,Wed Jun 24 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"It also had a movie to build on, something Dark Matter doesn't have. People already knew what the Stargate was, so you didn't have any extensive world building to do that could get in the way of story telling.  With Dark Matter it's a different ballgame. We have no idea who these people are (they don't even know themselves), where we are in the universe, what year it is, where the planet they're at is relative to the Earth, etc. etc.  We're still in the process of building the world, ""setting the stage"" if you will. And while that's no excuse for mediocre characters, you can't really do much with a bunch of amnesic mercenaries who have faint memories of their past skillsets without it coming across as a bit heavy handed.  That said, Killjoys isn't doing much better. They did build the world much faster, though, by establishing who the main characters are, what their relationships are, where they are, what they're doing, and so on. Their characters just aren't very good either.  Give both shows a chance. A lot of shows come off on a rocky start. Take a look at Agents of SHIELD. Everyone can agree that that show wasn't very good at the beginning, but after the Hydra event it turned into something much better."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,Leigh_Wright,2,Wed Jun 24 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"I agree - give shows a chance! Making snap decisions and making judgments about shows before they've even had a chance to develop is not helping the climate of tv.  Too many shows with potential have been cancelled because people didn't support them. Fair enough if you decide that you really don't like a show, but to make a judgment based on one or two episodes seems to be jumping the gun a little. I'd personally rather have 'light' scifi like 'Dark Matter' than no scifi at all, which it seems what it's been like recently. And who knows, these shows might just surprise us if given the chance!  The Syfy channel deserves our support in it's efforts to bring back scifi to tv (well overdue), but if it doesn't get that support, then we likely won't get anything.  Ah, I succumbed to a rant. My apologies.   I say lets give Dark Matter a real chance before we dismiss it! What's behind those big doors in the ship anyway? :)"
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,FlyingBishop,0,Thu Jun 25 08:28:26 2015 UTC,"Too many shows with potential have been cancelled because people didn't support them.    IDK, really, most of the great shows out there showed their tone & quality very well in the pilot. The pilot made me sit up & notice, saying something like ""Wow, I can't wait to see the next episode"".   I mean, that's exactly the point of a pilot to set up the plot & more importantly to sell the show to a network & viewers.  Dark Mater failed to sell me on the show."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,gophercuresself,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:11:01 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, and agree that in some ways it's better to strive toward quality shows that excite rather than settling for the mediocre. And ultimately if you don't feel a show is worth your time then fair enough. But sometimes it's more that people's expectations get in the way, or they just plain don't give things a chance. The classic example of this is Firefly, of course. A lot of people were turned off by the whole 'cowboys in space' thing and didn't stick around long enough to realise that something special was happening until it was too late and the network had cancelled the show.  All of that banter doesn't stop some shows just not quite reaching certain levels of achievement of quality, good writing, and execution, of course, but I've found that most shows are deserving of appreciation on some level."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,rekjensen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:01:38 2015 UTC,"The premise sounds like it's a LOST-type show, that is to say, it doesn't really have a world, the writers are basically just bullshitting 24/7 and 95% of the show is going to be faux-worldbuilding with nothing concrete emerging, and no actually meaningful dialogue.   The Leftovers is another good example in the genre of shows that pretend to be gradually revealing part of some cohesive whole but are really just going for the biggest continuous shock possible."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,TheDudeNeverBowls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"The difference being, however you feel about the premise and plot, The Leftovers had compelling thoughtfully written characters from the start. The quality difference is pretty stark."

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,ghjm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:21:33 2015 UTC,"It depends what exactly you mean by hard science fiction, which is why I was vague in the original comment. I think to be ""hard,"" the story must not contravene the known laws of physics - which may include reasonably plausible future developments in physics. So Space: Above and Beyond, Ascention, Planetes and early Battlestar Galactica (before the writers gave up and everything turned out to just be magic) would qualify. Arguably Firefly, if you're willing to grant River's psychic powers. Arguably Sliders, Stargate: SG-1 and (over a beer) Farscape, if you're willing to grant wormhole portal travel. Probably others."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,RupeThereItIs,6,Wed Jun 24 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm,  I guess your definition of hard scifi is way different then mine.  Almost all of these have faster then light travel, which with our current technology & understanding of physics is 'magic'.  SG1, love the show, WAY NOT hard scifi. It's got a contemporary setting, but it's all about magic & monsters."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,ghjm,2,Wed Jun 24 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"To say that FTL automatically means ""not hard SF"" means that Niven, Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein aren't hard SF.  We have no reason to imagine that we, in 2015, are at the end of physics and that new discoveries can't be made. So if a story is set in the far future, it's not unreasonable to say that in that world, FTL or wormhole travel turned out to be possible. To me there is a difference between the FTL in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which can take you anywhere in any amount of time or turn you into a whale, and the FTL in the first few episodes of Battlestar Galactica, which is very much subject to uncompromising laws of (future) physics.  Also, some people take ""hard SF"" to mean that the story is mostly about the science, how the technology works, etc. I don't agree with this - I think a story can be hard SF even if the science and technology is not the focus, as long as the rules are followed. SG1 is all about the monster of the week, but I don't recall it being much about magic - what the monster of the week is doing is generally physically possible, even if we don't spend a lot of time dwelling on exactly how it works."

I don't see that in the majority of the titles you listed. Almost every one of them has some level of hand waving & ""it's magic"" involved in key plot points. I'm not putting them down, they are some of my favorite shows, but they are not hard scifi.  I don't think we'll ever see much hard scifi on television, as it's very difficult to transfer to the screen (and often very very dry & niche anyway)."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,wokeupabug,3,Wed Jun 24 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"How much emphasis is enough? If perfect compliance is required at all times, then the works of Asimov, Clarke, Niven et. al. don't qualify, either. There has to be some flexibility for the purpose of story. So for example, historical fiction is still historical fiction - not fantasy - even if it has two historical characters meet who never actually met.  I think Ringworld would make a great miniseries, and I would call it hard SF, even if it has future-physics like FTL travel and scrith."

We have really awesome reasons to imagine that FTL is not going to be one of them.  We're not just talking going really really fast here, we're talking about violating a deeply fundamental constraint of the universe.  What makes you consider it a ""reasonably plausible future development""?  Do you consider time travel one too?  Where do you draw the line?   SG1 is all about the monster of the week, but I don't recall it being much about magic   Have we been watching the same show?

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,wokeupabug,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"It's not as if Jane is right about things all the time...   I believe the official rule is that we are certain of the things he says when he's wearing a toque, and even then only on matters of faith and morals.   I don't count it as a retcon if it doesn't actually contradict the original source. Are you saying it does?    The viewer's encounter with the original details was in a flexible enough context that the retcon didn't require undue violence, but I do think the space madness theory was meant to be canon at the time.   Religion is a huge force in any society. It's when the religion starts producing actual miracles that I get off the bus, or at least, I stop calling it hard SF.   There was some excellent religion-as-a-social-institution stuff throughout, but I mean the larger stuff too...  There's something to be said for fiction that establishes and sticks to rules--I'm just not as convinced as some people that the contentious Starbuck and, later, Baltar and Six stuff was rule-breaky.  It seems to me that there was from the outset this business of fate contriving to bring about an eternal repetition of a series of events, with the different parties switching roles, but where there also wiggle room involving what individuals learn from this and how they react to it.  There's lots of different ways this theme could have been explained in the end, but I don't think that there actually being interventions from whatever this fate is counts as a violation of or betrayal of this theme.  Presumably something like that result had to be a live option, or else the narrative tension around the themes of fate and responsibility become reduced to an exercise in irony where the audience rightly takes themselves to know that all this fate business is just the character's superstitious interpretations of relics from their ancestor's exodus (or whatever), and the enjoyment comes from knowing better than all the characters while one watches them goof things up--which I suppose is a fine enough narrative exercise, but it does seem to me to cheapen some of the tension."

There seemed to be a lot of hand-waving ""it's mysterious"" stuff that didn't make much sense, and felt like a let-down after the crispness of the earlier episodes. Or maybe I was just too dumb to get it. Whatever."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I confess I am devil's advocating a bit for the show.  I would have been happier if there were no, or at least no obvious, personifications/interventions by fate, and the fated outcomes were all motivated immanently by the relics of the last cycle.  In a sense, that leaves the issue even more suspended, since the viewer can still interpret the characters' religious appeals in a number of ways.  I would have been annoyed if all the fate and religion stuff was definitively, reductively explained-away.  Not that that's a bad idea in principle, but I think that wouldn't have fit what the show was about.  I suppose that's more what I mean here, and, devil's advocacy aside, I do think they went too heavy-handedly in the other direction."

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,Ebethron,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"Space Odyssey (TV series):       Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets (released as Voyage to the Planets and Beyond in the United States) is a fictional documentary about a manned voyage through the solar system. Space Odyssey premiered in 2004 and was made by the BBC. It was written and directed by Joe Ahearne and produced by Christopher Riley, who was presented with the 2005 Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best TV & Radio Presentation.   The story is set at an unspecified time in the future, though in the accompanying book, the mission's chief science officer recalls reading Arthur C. Clarke's 2010 (published 1982) some 40 years earlier.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,chezze,3,Wed Jun 24 20:10:20 2015 UTC,Rick and Morty should be on the list.   Plus I didn't see The Last Man on Earth.... Which I really enjoyed both.   Plus Wayward Pines..... Should Not be cancelled.
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,razuku,4,Wed Jun 24 17:48:43 2015 UTC,The last man on earth is just straight up BAD!  First episode had some potential but pffff after that... What a debacle!
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,amaefm,3,Wed Jun 24 17:52:01 2015 UTC,yeah it was so crap. Alone in the world. Finds 2 girls. Grown man just running around thinking about sex like he was 14 years old.   Damn i could not watch more then 4-5 episodes.

sciencefiction,3ay8wc,Ne007,3,Wed Jun 24 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"Feels very low brow to me.  Like, the character is so poorly written I struggle to watch.  His motivations are mostly understandable, because they beat you over the head with them, but his actions are too absurd to be believed.   He's like a Saturday morning cartoon character, not a human being."
sciencefiction,3ay8wc,grassmunk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's the point.  He's an extreme example of feelings that people have and then he executes on them in the worst possible fashion.  He's a buffoon with a sort of heart of gold.  It's not supposed to be realistic."
