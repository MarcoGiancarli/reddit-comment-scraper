I know none of us can fully guarantee this is all on Vulcan, but they're definitely the #1 suspect.   Unfortunately, Pros can't stop people from joining their lobbies (the tool to prevent it wasn't implemented by SH). So keeping random players from joining your lobby will always be difficult, at least for now. We will probably have to wait for BO3 to come around, and hopefully implement a feature that PROHIBITS people from joining your session w/o permission.   All in all, I think betting platforms like Vulcan is really good for the scene, and can be healthy. We just need the pros to get use to changing their IPs, and we need future Developers to implement a feature to stop people from joining your session (like I believe BO2 had).   As long as we have that tool, getting hit-off won't be a problem (or can be avoided at least). But until then, this is the sad reality of it."

Players: Not really sure what to put for this, you'll just have to watch the teams and find out which players you like.  Is it Intense and Passionate: Yes, players love playing it and the games get really heated and intense at times. It is treated like a job though so passion my not be the best word.  What sensitivity do players use: most use anywhere from 3-5, but some are higher most notably a new player on Epsilon named Royalty plays on a 12 sens.   Relevant EU scene: Sorta but it isn't as big as the US scene it. Gfinity is working to change that though so i would expect better things to come for the EU side of things.  Worlds: Its for any team that wants to attend. I don't know if they are inviting certain teams but as of right now it looks like anybody that purchases a team pass can attend.   SnD: Snd is played once in a B03, twice in BO5s and BO7s. AW seems more random than other Cods ( and it mostly is ) but once you watch more you'll see that there are methods and strats for just about everything."

CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,ComplexityFanboy,10,Tue Jul 21 19:58:58 2015 UTC,I dont think the really young players who right now rely just on gunskill are going to be doing quite as well come BO3 since the game isn't appearing quite as fast. I expect the guys who were great in ghosts/bo2 to be on the top again
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,tips1660,5,Tue Jul 21 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. No offense to any players, but the ones that go around mindlessly and crazily slaying won't be as good in BO3 as in AW. They will still probably be good but smarter players will be good again, such as Killa, Parasite (he's good but not as good as previous games), Karma, TeeP, Aches, etc."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,oTc_DragonZ,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Please explain to me what ""mindlessly and crazily slaying"" means and why it would have any effect on how well they do in BO3?   Do you really think those guys are just sprinting around the map with their heads cutoff? They know the spawns, they know where their teammates are spawning, they know the objective, the rotations, etc., and they take advantage of that; and more importantly of all, they have better gunskill.   Everything I listed is part of some sort of tactic. You make it sound like they just run around the map and drop 40 bombs on accident. That couldn't be further from the truth."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Essentially it boils down to AW favouring a wreckless playstyle whereas previous CoDs were much slower and more methodical. Those that play at a really high pace and don't stop moving might not be as good at a game that plays slower, just like some of those that thrived during the slower game (Aches, Teep, Merk etc) failed to adapt well to the increased pace."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,Swalesy6,4,Tue Jul 21 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Scump had amazing gunskill in BO2, but he wasn't T10 or close to it. He mindlessly slayed and wasn't a smart player then. BO3 (if its anything like BO2) will rely more on intelligence than AW, even though gunskill will still be very important. Killa didn't have the best gunskill in BO2 but was still regarded as a top player. I didn't say the players would fall off, what I mean is they won't be as good in BO3 as they are right now in AW. Players with amazing movement may not be as good either. The smarter players will be better than they are right now, or the ones who don't have as good movement."

CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"These comments about gunskill not mattering as much just blow my mind. I'm starting to question how many people in this subreddit actually play COD.   I don't see how any COD title would ever ""rely less on gunskill"". Gunskill is just part of the game; you either have a good shot or you don't, and if you don't, you'll die more, lose more rounds, and lose more games.   The whole argument is so pointless and moot. People are essentially saying ""people with good shots in AW won't be as good at BO3 because AW has exos and BO3 doesn't and something, something tactics"".  The same people who dominated in AW are going to dominate in BO3. Why? Because the people who dominated in AW are truly better players than the rest. AW without a doubt had a higher skill gap than really any previous COD game. And before people come at me saying it was ""more random"", well then that just forces you to have better callouts, better communication, and better awareness, both as an individual player and as a team.   EDIT: Even if you disagree with the skillgap comment I made, you can't disagree with good players just downright being good. Most players don't just fall off, and the ones that supposedly have didn't fall off, people just caught up to them. Simply put: COD is a FPS. Just like any other FPS, if you have a good shot, you'll be good at the game. Playing at the pro level, grinding day in and day out, you don't just magically get worse because a new game comes out. Most (not all, but most) of the top players from BO2 are still the top players in AW."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,C3_Carnag3,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of what you're saying, but you have to acknowledge that the movement is far different in AW than any other CoD, and that players who maybe have a big advantage due to movement may not be as strong. It's just common sense."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,12temp,0,Tue Jul 21 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"But the movement itself forces you to be even more accurate; it takes more skill to shoot someone while exo boosting and dashing than it does running on the ground.  I'm not trying to take anything away from the classic COD players, I'm just stating the obvious.   If you can boost dash, exo jump all over the place and still melt people, you absolutely have an excellent shot. Why would moving to the ground change that?"
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,oTc_DragonZ,3,Tue Jul 21 20:50:56 2015 UTC,You do realize that the aim assist in AW is higher than any other cod right...?
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,sansol2100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:59 2015 UTC,Learning the movement is a whole new addition to a call of duty game. Never did pros have to learn to strafe or boost double jump while shooting. Im sorry but the T10 in BO3 will be nothing like AW
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"huh thats funny, because the T10 is very similar to what it was in ghosts. and some what similar to what it was in blops 2. I think T10 in blops 3 will be very close to what it is now"
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,sansol2100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:11 2015 UTC,The T10 changes for every cod pretty much. I agree though.
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,2,Tue Jul 21 20:54:01 2015 UTC,Aw did not have a higher skillgap then bo2 in any way whatsoever...
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,sansol2100,4,Tue Jul 21 20:45:57 2015 UTC,IMO it absolutely has a higher skillgap than BO2.   EDIT: Downvotes are cool because someone has a differing opinion than yours.
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,3,Tue Jul 21 20:49:38 2015 UTC,Explain please?
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,sansol2100,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"Advanced Warfare and exo suits forced players to have a better shot, and be more accurate. Jumping in the air and killing someone is much more difficult than getting a kill on the ground.   Pair that with the movement, i.e. someone can jump over your head, from the side, from the top, etc., forces you to have better communication in this game with your teammates and better overall awareness.  I should mention, I actually am not really a huge fan of AW. I'm not trying to rip on anyone or offend anybody, but the skillgap in this game is larger than any other COD; if you disagree, that's fine, but don't downvote me for my opinion.  Probably doesn't matter because I don't expect people to understand. This will just turn into a big circlejerk about BO2 being the best and people living in the past. I'm sure the people shelling out downvotes hate AW because it's ""random"" when in all reality it's because it's just not as easy to get kills in this game as it was in past COD titles."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,RemoteSenses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Aw has a higher skillgap in gunfights, thats it. Bo2 had specific roles that actually meant something. You had to anchir and rotate for every hill. You had to 100% know all the spawns in both respawns, there was actual strats in snd instead of just 4 man pushing. In bo2 if you lost the rotation on certain hills, the hill was lost, in aw you just come back after 2 seconds and break it. Basically, aw takes more skill to win a gunfight but less to win a map."
CoDCompetitive,3e40h6,oTc_DragonZ,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:25:42 2015 UTC,"Aw has a higher skillgap in gunfights, thats it.   You say ""that's it"" as if it's a small part of the game.

Basically, aw takes more skill to win a gunfight but less to win a map.   Soooo, wouldn't that make the game more competitive. You literally just said AW takes more skill to win a gunfight - what the hell else are you doing in this game other than shooting people? You kill more = you win more. Your logic is just not good at all.  Come on people. For christ sake, your gun skill is the deciding factor of you winning or losing.   All of this talk about tactics and slowness and thinking methodical - last I checked, the only gamemode isn't SnD. Hardpoint is fast paced and heavily relies on your teams ability to slay and hold down the hill - you get outslayed and more often than none, you're going to lose.  Real question: when is the last time you played COD on a competitive level? Gamebattles, UMGs, etc? When is the last time you even played COD in general?"

There's a certain period of time during the application process where you can't leave the country. Unfortunately for OG, that happened to be right when they needed to travel for ESWC and Gfinity.

It could be your sens is to high for you to make the adjustments necessary at long range with an SMG or (like me) you aren't good enough to hit the shots. In the first instance lower your sens a bit and give it a chance, play with it for up to a week. If you find that doesnt help, change your playstyle to avoid long range gunfights as I was forced to. Play close to your AR on rotation and flank quite a lot."

CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,ssshadow89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"I found that my shot isn't significantly better when I run three sens.  I play on 5 now and feel a lot more comfortable.  Believe it or not I seem to win more long range gun fights with people flying and dashing through the air on 5 sens then I did on three. I honestly don't know how scump plays on 3 and runs a sub, it's just what's comfortable for him I guess. Sensitivity isn't the whole story when it comes to your shot.  I believe practice and natural ability are more important. Look at royalty, he can hit long range shots on 12 sens."
CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,pac1cap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"Also what do you mean by long range. I assume you mean long range for a sub, because if you're talking about long range for an ar or sniper maybe you shouldn't be challenging from that distance with a sub"
CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,pac1cap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"I play on a 3 sensitivity and I have no problems aiming up close and turning on people.  The only thing is when you want to do those quick adjustments up close you can't be ADSing because that's where the 3 sensitivity hurts.  So if you're in a close gun fight just un-ADS real quick, center up on the target and then re-ADS."
CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,maLeFxcTor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know if if will help out long range, but I've always played with a 2 sensitivity on MWs and a 3 sensitivity on Ghosts and BO. I've always had around a 1.5 K/D ratio. I feel like a slower sensitivity helps me stay more accurate. But it's all about what you're most comfortable with."
CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,ThorneSizemore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:49 2015 UTC,I play on 8 and can land shots as long as there not boosting like a jumping bean
CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,LordBpicks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing on a 3 three days ago. I switched back to 4. I can still hit medium-range shots, just not as effectively. I only switched because I was dying BECAUSE of the slow sensitivity. It doesn't make sense when I was winning most of my gunfights because of it until a day prior to that, but eh. Since I stick close to the hill and just kill everything I can around it, a 4 seems to work best for me. Also because I go in the hill when my obj is down too, that's another reason.  My point is to just stick to what you're comfortable with. If you feel you need to lower it to a 3, try it for a day or two. If it doesn't work out, go back to a 4."

CoDCompetitive,3e2jez,Pazziny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"You should be fine at 3 given you have a good reaction time. However, my advice is to limit your long range engagements. Think of it this way, you're an OBJ. And while yes, everybody has to contribute kill wise to win maps, that is not always the biggest piece of the puzzle. Staying alive as an OBJ is a huge benefit to any teams success. So don't be afraid to hide in corners and wait for your team to push up and help. That is one simple things that separates AMs from ""top AMs"" and ""top AMs"" from pros. Just a little bit of advice. Take it as you will."

CoDCompetitive,3dzd9n,iSwedishVirus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"Lol it's not even about not sitting in the hill or as you call it ""kill whore"", they get into a hill and setup but instantly get broken and lose controll of the hill.

CoDCompetitive,3dzd9n,nate517,0,Mon Jul 20 20:33:35 2015 UTC,I agree my word choice was bery poor. My corrected  response  is that Envy only put one guy in the hill and when he gets killed out Envy are slow to replace him. As they are all still trying to hold their cut. They are making the same mistake that OG are doing in not flooding the hills. They are constantly out flooded and they lose time on that.

The SnD... meh i dislike Highrise so my opinion is biased there. The Uplink went as expected. The 2nd Hardpoint was way too close. nV playing with half their team and Merk who ended like double negative (or close to it). If they (tK) didn't hold that last hill as good as they did, nV could have easily taken it from them. The last SnD was pretty much over before it started. tK is a pretty good SnD team and when you're only playing against half the nV line-up it's pretty much a gift.

Hell, coL had to defeat one of the all-time great teams (twice) just to get that number one spot. OG's early challengers consisted of a FaZe team that few backed and then a Stunner org fresh on the scene.   We have some great young players coming through now, with some great players having left the scene or having poor years now. Every CoD has always had young talent threatening to break through. The difference in AW is the number of LAN events gives more oppurtunities for these ""SnD kids/warriors"" to show they're actually good players and deserve respect.  As for your point about OG's wins (in one game) versus coL's, the same applies; there are a lot more events now. Ultimately it's not coL's failing that they had fewer opportunities to win per year than OG have had currently. coL were the best for a full year; let's see OG achieve that feat and, if they do, surpass it."

Not saying the talent pool back then was stronger than it is now, but you are leaving out a lot of great players that no longer play.

CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,jcrankin22,8,Mon Jul 20 21:18:02 2015 UTC,Imo in order for OG to solidify their greatness they have to win cod champs. You can't the greatest teams of all time w/o winning the biggest tournament. CoL/EG also dominated BO2 (after Impact won champs) and continued past Ghost Champs. CoL/EG took down every challenge no matter how strong opposing teams looked they always found way to beat them. CoL/EG downfall was themselves not opposing teams.

CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,TheBCG616,5,Tue Jul 21 01:17:24 2015 UTC,I have never said that OG could never reach coL/EG. The thing that OG have failed to do for me is make it seem like they are untouchable. Have Optic been the best in AW? Absolutely. Have they achieved something no other team has done in that so far until arguably this Faze roster they have been the best team in the game. Of course. If OG can remain at the very top for a full 12 months then that is better than coL/EG IMO. Its all completely personal opinion when comparing two teams from different eras.
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,FlowseL,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"I also don't think OG is coL/EG level but one thing you're forgetting is you're comparing two different eras. The talent level now is FAR superior to what was there in BO2 and early Ghosts. Also, a lot of players are taking this a lot more serious now, back then, almost everyone was still in school or were working jobs because they couldn't make a solid income from this. There weren't even 2Ks/5Ks in the first half of BO2, players had no form of income besides tournament earnings and whatever they earned from 200-300 Twitch viewers, if they even streamed. There wasn't really a reason to devote all your attention to the game, but there is now and that's why we're seeing so many more talented players and teams.  My point is, if this OG roster was a thing in BO2 (let's just say Formal enters the scene a year earlier than he did) and Ghosts and that coL team didn't exist, they more than likely would have accomplished the same feats as coL."
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,Chi-Cam,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"Far better? Ehh I would definitely not say that also Blops 2 is a way harder game to dominate then AW. Just find 4 Slayers and your good but in Blops 2 roles, rotation and teamwork was critical. The player right now have great gunskill but gunskill alone in blops 2 wasn't enough which really separated imo Scump from my top 5 players that game. I don't agree with your assessment on OG being in the Blops 2 game it would be different Scump would be the same, Formal wouldn't look that great like he did when he started in ghosts he only looked like the GOD around Nv. What I'm saying is the AW logic is who ha she better slaying power is the better team but in Blops2 you can be the better gunskill team but still struggle if you face a well orientated team. Look at the Nv squad for example."
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,FlowseL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"Finally someone with a good, analytical response. You make a good point that roles were evident in BO2 whereas now it's just 4 slayers and you're good to go. However I don't agree with your outlook on Formal. I think a lot of people said he was just a Ghoster because of how fast he picked up the game and became a great player. Then he gets on AW and dominates everything with a BAL. I think Formal with an M8A1 would have been dominant, he's a great player when he just needs to pre-aim and shoot which is what anchoring basically was. Sit in a power position, pre-aim and don't miss. Of course rotating was a big part, but Formal is a very smart player and would have learned that easily.   The roles for this OG team would be Scump and Karma as roamers, Crim as support, filling in if they need a second AR or if they need more sub pressure, and Formal would lock down the map with an AR."
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,Chi-Cam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:00:40 2015 UTC,I like your Formal statement I didn't think about that much. I don't know who would sacrifice to be obj tho cause you need a dirty worker/ behind enemy lines solder to take the risk for the team. But ik sure they would figure it out somehow.
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,TheBCG616,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not forgetting that... Read the last sentence of my previous response, it responds to all of this."
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,xShadow125,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"Actually OG has arguably 2 of the best slayers right from the team during the EG/coL era so that alone is a reason why they keep coming out on top, the thing is that they were considered the best in the entire game, that's why they're so successful and then you have Scump who is also considered one of the best slayers and Formal is also gifted at FPS games, so you really don't think this team would carry it into the next title? Of course they would, and they would have melted if they played together on BO2, Crim, and Karma being the best BO2 players you can ever imagine. A lot has changed since BO2 days, there's no need of an anchor but I'm sure Formal would do it flawlessly. Also AW is just as OBJ heavy as BO2, it's just that slayers have replaced the OBJ roles because in order to do the objective you must slay, and it's no longer acceptable to go 15-30 and use OBJ as an excuse, even if we were still playing BO2 the rules would get more strict with OBJ and it would seem like everyone is slaying when in fact they're doing it to get the objective done."

CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,C3_Carnag3,4,Mon Jul 20 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"Ghosts pre-vector was insanely teamwork-oriented. How can you say a gametype like Blitz was only about slaying? Domination was also about capturing and holding flags, which is also not only about slaying."
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,atJamesFranco,0,Tue Jul 21 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"Blitz was only getting kills or Overextending to the opponents base in order to get caps because you were being outslayed. Domination is the exact same as hardpoint in AW. You capture the zone, try to get preferable spawns without screwing up the spawns for yourself. So yes, Ghosts was only about slaying. There was no anchoring of any sort in Ghosts."

CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,tyzenberg,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:35 2015 UTC,I agree. Not to jump on the Karma hate bandwagon but I think if they do poorly at gfinity and Karma has a 0.8-0.9 KD again they should look at picking up Saints for the remainder of American events.

The parity we are seeing now is a result of AW being a reset button on the pro scene, that's why there are so many guys who are current top players who were, only a year or two back, unheard of or bottom tier guys/top ams."

Imagine of OG just vetoed Comeback UL off the bat each time.  that being said, they lost the most important tournament of the year--got their worst placing, actually. If they don't do well at the two remaining large tourneys (Worlds and GFinity 100k), then I'm not sure it matters how much you won.  On the flip side, if they win those two and win like half the events leading up to Champs AND Champs in BOIII I think they've passed all the teams. That would be at least 9 wins in one game and another 3 or so in another game with one Cod Championship, one X-Games, etc."

One thing to remember is that Faze just won the 10k without dropping a map, then, Optic Gaming after some proper gaming time this weekend take 7 maps off of Faze.

You can't have a godsquad if the best players in an esport are all on one team.  So please tell me how this Faze roster is a godsquad. You know what a true godsquad would be? Put Clayster on OG.
CoDCompetitive,3dzppt,johnnyboy181,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"OG is already a true godsquad now. A godsquad is a team made up of all top top players, and it was said when the community still believed this ""roles"" nonsense. people used to call god squads teams with top players chucked together.   Clay is a t2 AR some may say he is the best, Zouma is a t5 player on his day and so is Attach. Enable has been very solid in this game too. This FaZe is a godsquad"

CoDCompetitive,3e00z5,TheOriginalRed,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"From my experience on GB, don't play singles unless you're playing radar. Radar matches prevents radar cheating.  If that's not an option, avoid singles (a lot of cheaters play no radar singles) and run team/dubs with MLG settings, you'll usually get opponents who are actually looking for a challenge instead of hunting for easy xp.  Booting will always be an issue. If you face booters, make it impossible to play the match, have a teammate dashboard over and over again as if he's lagging out, and keep ending the match, after ten to fifteen minutes of annoyance, many team opt to cancel or dispute a no show, but if your guy is ""lagging out"" in the first thirty seconds, it'll usually end in a cancel.  One last resort, if you're 100% sure that your opponent is running radar hacks, put radar always on when you host. I've done that before and won against cheaters who were unable to post proof due to red boxes being on their screen. Although that was back in the day on MW2/COD4, idk how hacks are on the new games so that option might just end with you getting a dispute loss, and maybe even a one day ban."

CoDCompetitive,3e00z5,BirthdaySong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"Just go to the home screen on your console.  On the 360 you open the menu with the middle button and press Y.  On the Xbox One you open the menu and press start on the game and go down the ""Quit"" selection.  Idk about PS3/PS4 though.  When you do this, the message ""RandomGT123 has disconnected due to transmission error"".  So it looks like a lagout and there is no way to prove that it's a dashboard. You can say that the disc screwed up/game crashed if someone catches them on the dashboard in profile view.  This is a neat way to buy yourself some time or stall a match if your waiting for someone/playing cheaters."

As for the theater thing you know how at the beginning of each round there is a timer? The only way to properly do the ghost/radar glitch is to have that countdown set to 0 when the rules state it should be at 5 I think (definitely not 0). He would forfeit for having wrong rules in that case."
CoDCompetitive,3e00z5,xShadow125,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"Or he could spawn in after the countdown? It's a good thing you can now see perks on the killcam though, literally the only way this cheat was possible, that and no eSports rules. A simple Treyarch fix for BO2 on this would be to make radar always on apply to Ghosts as well, idk if they still support it with patches though a few camos have came out after the cycle, it's all I'm aware of."
CoDCompetitive,3e00z5,Mortalities,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"No, the issue is that the only time you can know if someone is using this glitch is during that countdown since ghost doesn't work.

One bad year isn't enough to condemn a guy. He very well could bounce back in the next game or the one afterward. People as gifted as him generally find a way to become relevant even after falling off. Furthermore, a big reason why he has fallen is his attitude and his personality, if he can get his head on straight he might be able to salvage his reputation and climb back on the mountain.  Furthermore, your readiness to pounce on a guy who has fallen after reaching a high plateau speaks to your own lack of professionalism and it shows a tad bit of hypocrisy. Remember, it wasn't so long ago you were teaming with amateurs in MW3.  This, btw, is coming from a Killa hater, I think the guy is a damned lunatic and a bad seed in comp cod, but you got to respect skill when it's there."
CoDCompetitive,3e00pn,HunterJJ,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:00 2015 UTC,I respect his Bops2 play for sure. He was over hyped in Ghosts and in this game he's felt entitled to being on T4 teams when he played really sub par every event then consistently teams with the same few players thinking it will work when it doesn't.
CoDCompetitive,3e00pn,BrianSaintt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you just said.  I'm about to be an apologist though.  Ghosts was a chore to play, most of the maps wouldn't have made the cut on any previous game. IMO the maps in MW3 were more suited for competitive play than the maps in ghost. Maps like Octane and Sovereign were the best that game had to offer and those maps were sub par at best. I will give that game credit for having solid mechanics (aside from curving bullets), but the maps were truly horrific.  AW is a mess of gunplay and spastic movement, the mechanics are a mess, although the maps are good.   Neither game has the complete package for competitive cod.   If BLOPS3 has that mix of maps and mechanics, like BLOPS2/MW2/COD4/BLOPS1 then I can see Killa making a comeback.   I don't know the guy, but he seems driven on emotion and it's hard to get hyped to play Ghosts/AW when both have been pretty bad albeit for different reasons.   So my verdict on Killa is that his career hinges on Treyarch's performance. If they make a good competitive game, Killa will be on T4 teams. If it sucks, we'll see him struggling to place T8 if that."

CoDCompetitive,3dzzn2,Compton727,3,Mon Jul 20 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to the fact that many people in the cod community are overcompensating for having a shitty life outside of their online worlds.   A lot of guys in the community put too much stock into what they've achieved in COD because they haven't achieved jack shit in real life. I know about this all too well because I was exactly like that.  When I was playing in HS I had no life. It was before I got into bodybuilding and before I normalized (personality wise) so I wasn't popular in RL (not hated but kind of in the background I guess) and overweight.  So I put a lot of meaning into my online/LAN achievements due to the fact that in RL I was just some unassuming chubby high schooler who drifted about in the back of classrooms, getting no invites to parties, playing on no athletic teams, getting decent but not outstanding grades, and getting no hoes.  I think that's why a lot of players become assholes, especially pros. A lot of pros are complete nobodies in real life social and professional circles, so they over-inflate the importance of gaming in order to boost their ego (subconsciously of course).  Because they inflate the importance of their gaming careers, they start to look down on people who aren't pro gamers, or even pros who are lower tier, and this mentality trickles down to even the lowest dregs of the competitive scene where even the worst amateurs you can find will call you a plethora of names for doing worse than them in a scrim/match/LAN etc.  Armchair psychologist mode disengaged."

CoDCompetitive,3dzzn2,Tc_Cartel,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"My first COD was Black Ops, jumped over from Halo 3, which I only casually played. I was terrible for awhile, then started to find my groove towards the end of the game's cycle.  MW3 rolled around and I knew I had found something. I was quite the pub stomper for awhile, then one of my good friends from childhood said his team was looking for a 4th after a bit of a falling out. Keep in mind I had never heard of GBs, competitive, or even what a LAN was, but I knew how to play the game. We rolled together for a bit, did fairly well in scrims, placed 4th at a local LAN, then slowly dwindled towards the end of the MW3's cycle. Looking back I don't think any of us lost our drive, other teams just were getting better while we plateaued.  Black Ops II came out and we continued to perform adequately through the first couple months. By this time our best player lost his patience with us and decided to move on to something better. We played LF1 with pickup players for what seemed like forever but never got anywhere close to what we once were. We ultimately decided around champs time that it would be best to move on to another team or call it quits. Me and my childhood friend chose the latter. The other two guys still put around the AM scene I'm pretty sure, but I haven't seen them in a long time.  Comp COD is still enjoyable as shit to me and will always hold a soft spot in my heart."

If you had to see them outwith the groups they hang with they wont say much. I retired from competitive to start and fund my own organisation because i got bored of all the attitude and trash talk.

There is nothing you can do except change your IP and that doesnt matter if the person pulling your IP is in the lobby.  All they have to do is look at which IP is different and they can hit you again.  Home connection or business connection, you are still using TCPIP.  The only difference is that most businesses have static IPs where as a home connection only leases an IP for 7-15 days before renewing or getting a new IP.

CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,Brocco-,2,Mon Jul 20 02:50:55 2015 UTC,In order for a VPN to be effective you have to have an extremely fast dedicated server hosting your VPN.  I have a application that I built with a few pros back in MW3 that worked very well.  We called it NoBoot.  The problem is that it costs so much to run such big servers that it became impossible to monetize.
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,SecKceYY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:56:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it's something MLG would need to purchase on their own to help run their league.
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,GoMLism,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:36 2015 UTC,I don't think you guys understand that when you play on a VPN it negatively effects your ping.
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,AfraidOfNades,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if this has ever been attempted. VPN comes with an overhead that manifests itself in the form of latency. The data is essentially ""encrypted"" and ""decrypted"" in both directions making things a bit slower. In my mind, VPN shouldn't work because of this overhead, but I've never seen in attempted in the real world."
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,bastitch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:48 2015 UTC,see my comment above.  you can also disable encryption depending on the vpn client/server software you use.
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,SecKceYY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:31:03 2015 UTC,"I just realized something fundamental: If the DDOS (assuming players are getting hit off are getting ddosed) point is the router, a VPN won't prevent getting booted. A DDOS  overwhelms the external interface of the router so it cannot, or has a difficult time, transmitting packets.   If your  IP address is in fact known, VPN still won't save you."
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,bastitch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"When you use a VPN you route all traffic on your network through the VPN so when your IP gets sniffed, they sniff the VPN's IP address instead of your own IP on your modem or firewall.  The DDOS will then flood your VPNs IP address instead of your own.  The problem with most VPNs people use is that they are very low grade servers that will themselves get flooded.  Now, if you get a VPN, or set one up youself, on a datacenter like Amazons EC2 or Rackspace, you are utilizing the power of their servers and their datacenters internet which has a good chance of outperfoming the flood by simply being able to process all the packets.  Like I said before though, if someone floods you with a botnet of 2000 bots, it doenst matter what VPN you're on, its going to go offline."
CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,SecKceYY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:40:53 2015 UTC,Yeah knocking down low end vpns is pretty easy but the saving grace is you can connect to another IP almost immediately and get back on instead of being held off for hours(unless of course they have your actual IP in which case you're fucked unless you can change it easily).

CoDCompetitive,3dvxng,ShootinStars,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"Who told you that?  THats impossible because traffic is routed through your IP so if it changes ""on the fly"" you will drop packets.  Even if you connect via a VPN and then disconnect the VPN mid game you will still disconnect.  I've tried it several times during testing.  THe only way you can prevent getting DDOSed is to outperform the flood of packets."

Just imagine from their perspective..this is one of the first legal documents a lot of these guys have ever signed, coupled with the passion they have I can see how they'd enter less than favourable contracts and not fully understand the terms. It's not like they can afford amazing legal advice either - unless you're a popular Twitch/YTer or consistently placing in competition you're not making tons of money playing CoD (which is kinda fair imo, I'd do that shit for minimum wage...)."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,KillMeAndYouDie,5,Sun Jul 19 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"It's a contract, you don't need amazing legal advice, it's one of the most basic things that a solicitor would go over so it wouldn't be expensive in comparison to what they'd be earning during the contract.   For someone who is around 15/16, sure this would be rough but if you're 18, you should know this or at least their parents should. John should have definitely known this."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,Surfacing710,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"For someone who is around 15/16, sure this would be rough but if you're 18, you should know this   C'mon man, there's people who're 15 who have a better understanding of this stuff than a lot of people who're 18...understanding contracts isn't tied to age it's tied to experience. The difference between 15-18 is negligible in that sense.  I think it's a real shame the industry as a whole (not just CoD, but eSports in general) hasn't struck the balance between treating their players like kids and adults. That's not to say it's hell for them, but I feel they lack support in some vital areas including legal advice and emotional support. I've thought about this a lot lately because I was watching a documentary following a DOTA tournament and the amount the players cried was unreal, didn't seem like a fun life for a teenager.  I'm old by eSports standards, but I know 18 year old me would've crumbled in their spot."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,KillMeAndYouDie,2,Sun Jul 19 17:41:43 2015 UTC,in almost all other big games the contracts are real and binding - KESPA is a bitch about them and older teams like liquid and EG have long lasting contracts with players TLO just celebrated his 5 year anniversary with TL

I don't understand why players sign contracts that grant the org security and not their own. It's stupid when they make people ""buy you out"" yet you don't see any of the money that someone ""bought"" you for. It's also stupid that you can't leave or you owe them this when the reality is they can drop you at any second due to a termination clause thats in literally every contract.  All I'm saying is that it's up to the players to make sure theyre signing contracts that guarantee both themselves AND the org security."

Is it literally just a ""We can terminate your contract whenever we like, no questions asked""?  Surely if that's the case, players should be pushing for equality, in that if the player has to pay compensation to the org if s/he wants to terminate the contract, the org should have to pay compensation to the player if they want to terminate the contract. That's how these things normally go. Naturally there would and should be clauses, like improper conduct, whereby this compensation is waived, but in a general sense, that is how things really should be, in my opinion."

CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,K1ash,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said, except your complaint about players not getting any of the buy out money.

CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,Clay792,4,Sun Jul 19 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"But if you aren't getting paid salary from the contract, what you compensate the org with is your social media presence, placings, etc. That's the entire point, marketing for funding. When you involve salary, then theres something to be said about the buyout. When a team sells you for $5k, I'd expect at least 25% of that to go towards the player just because who they are is the only reason there's a buyout that high."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,K1ash,2,Sun Jul 19 18:24:18 2015 UTC,Well honestly no player should be signing a contract if they aren't getting a salary. I wish Cod had someone like /u/esportslaw to talk about situations like these.
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,Clay792,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:21 2015 UTC,But the honest truth in the situation is that only the top 8 teams are getting salary. I would go as far as to say that only 3/4 teams offer more than $1k a month salary. Orgs can get away signing people without salary because not every has the funding to get to events and back.

VVV clearly put in the term that he/or his next team has to pay the existing contract.  I do think it is stupid he has to buy himself out but that is only because he was stupid to not remove that part of his contract.  If he would have negotiated about the terms in his contract they might have removed it. Now they didn't and he is pissed of that he is stuck or has to pay up.  It all comes down to negotiation for future contracts, the org will try to get what is best for them and their growth and the players also want what is best for them."

In ghosts when sender left, they attempted to sue Reptar, the coowner of vQ for picking him up, and Reptar just sent the contract to his lawyer and the lawyer laughed.  On a side note - I believe in this industry there shouldn't be a contract that requires you buying out unless you're receiving a salary from the org. You should be free to leave if you aren't being paid by the org, point blank. The org picking up the players should be responsible financially for the team getting to the event, the team pass, and hotel room because those are all associated with a team representing you. If there is no salary in play, they shouldn't be trying to make some of the money back for funding the team."

CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,pantaloonsofJUSTICE,2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that contracts are one-sided, the org gives everything and gets no guarantees?

Never once did I say there was something wrong with the orgs attempting to hold the players to their contracts.  My issue here is that vVv is attempting to charge an outrageous amount of money for him to break his contract. 2k is an absurd amount to be released.   Had there been a salary in play for this, then that's reasonable. But 2k when john has made no money under their org is an insane amount of money. Hell even a small fee to be released from your contract is reasonable, just not one this large.  And back to what I was getting downvoted for - Orgs with professional players are expected to fund the event costs, point blank. If you look in this thread you'll see clay saying something similar. If a team plays under an org, it's a mutual business agreement. The team plays for the org, and the org covers the events costs.  This even happens at times in the AM scene. MOST org owners don't try to get this money back because they understand it's their responsibility as the owner of the org."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,pantaloonsofJUSTICE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"If the amount isn't stipulated, then why is he entitled to leave it at all? If the org is meeting him in the middle by allowing him to walk for any given amount of money that is by the kindness of their heart.   The org is expected to pay, and that is a service that is worth money. Why salary is expected to you when they are functionally paid to play without one is beyond me. They are compensated whether it's via a salary or having their travel and hotel costs compensated."

It will state in there that should a player decide to break the contract, they will be fined an amount to be determined by the organization or a % of the salaries earned. If players don't like it, they can read the contract and not sign it. This is a constant when you are out on your own. When ever you get a job, get an apartment, even get a cellphone, you are signing a contract. This has been a constant in the world for centuries"
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,Compton727,0,Sun Jul 19 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of what a contract is considering I've signed multiple in my life. Any lease I've ever signed has has a clause where I could leave simply by paying the cost of one months rent and that was that.  Any cell phone contract has an ETF of $350 max, which will lower over time, plus the cost of a device if you're leasing it.   I'm not trying to argue how a contact works. I'm just stating that the terms of the contract are fucking absurd and all of the players on vVv were stupid for signing them. They should've negotiated the terms before doing it."

But buyouts when the player has netted no income from the org aren't fair in my opinion.   A player/org contract should include terms such as   -representing the org on social media.  -representing the org in a professional manner.  -representing the sponsors and shouting them out.  -sportsman like conduct at events.  -wearing the org clothing at events, if you have them before the event that is.  Leaving your contract with no salary should be allowed if maybe you give back the products you received from the org and sponsors, or something like that. Not 2k when you've made no money."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,WispGB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:41 2015 UTC,the only reason he is being asked to pay that buy out is because no org will pay it for him. buyouts are part of almost any contract to prevent people coming and going as they please.

CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,Rikuide,13,Sun Jul 19 08:43:01 2015 UTC,"There's nothing ""fucked up"" and it's yet more naivety from John. Clearly the org were happy to let Killa leave and so both parties agreed to terminate the contract. Similarly, it's clear the org either wishes to keep John or realises they could secure compensation for him in which case they are perfectly entitled to enforce a contract that John signed.  We had the same situation with EG and its players. Folks were making out that EG were wrong to hold on to a contract, but what's the purpose of a contract if it's not going to protect both parties?  The org is under no obligation to adopt such a simple (hold everyone or hold none of them) as each player has a differing value/set of circumstances."
CoDCompetitive,3dth9i,SmellsLikeHerpesToMe,6,Sun Jul 19 08:49:02 2015 UTC,They could have had fair reason to release his contract. Maybe killa approached the organization on a sensible way

It's just an annoucement, and shouldn't force teams to particpate in tournments (if they feel they can make pool play, they should already be playing in these 2K's, 5K's and 10K's). And fyi, UMG are a business. They probably did this to reward/give an advantage to those teams that always compete in their comps no matter if it's within the time frame or not, and maybe so teams will from now on play in all their comps incase something like this reoccurs."

CoDCompetitive,3dqhqy,Boonsquemador,3,Sat Jul 18 22:37:48 2015 UTC,I'd love a vote surrender option in the competitive playlist.  If you're left playing 1v4 you shouldn't have to sit through 8 minutes of nothing just to avoid getting probation.
CoDCompetitive,3dqhqy,StingrayAffliction,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"i dont agree. if you pause the game it gives people the ability to work things out, talk about what they will do etc. it would be bad in SND. I can see why. What if you get in a gunfight and will most likely die, but the game gets paused and by that time you think of a way to get away? I think it would take the skill of making decisions in the moment away which is what competitive cod is really about. reacting quickly to situations and making decisions as you play. Also where would that person spawn if they disconnect? that could change the course of games.  I'm guessing this is an online feature and I just think its not worth it, people dont get hit off enough for this to be an issue"

CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,SpicyyTaco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:44 2015 UTC,his bal shot is really good though and even said himself that he thinks that his BAL shot could be better than his sub
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,InTopGear,2,Sun Jul 19 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Wtf your shot doesnt get better or worse depending on what gun you use your shot is the same across every gun, only thing that changes is recoil and aim assist in which case obviously the BAL is more accurate"
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,RiFume,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:08 2015 UTC,Not true. There are plenty of pros who use one of the two because they can't the use other. Perfect example is Attach. He couldn't use a bal against other pros if he tried.
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,Dbeck89,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"Because he doesnt have the right playstyle... Attach is one of the most aggressive players in the game of course he cant use a BAL, its nothing to do with his shot. Theres more to it than just 'picking up a BAL and playing slower', you're playing against people like Formal, Clayster, Slasher and Nameless who do nothing but use a BAL and know every trick in the book because theyve been playing that role for years (8 months in Formals case)."
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,RiFume,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:02:25 2015 UTC,BO1 famas obviously and he used an ACR a decent amount in MW3. He was also damn good with the BAL at the beginning of this game. Don't really see how it's even relevant since the hypothetical denial squad wouldn't run 4 Bals anyway.
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,Abs0luteZero273,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:16 2015 UTC,I would still take scump with a bal over pretty much anyone except clay and formal

CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,XvS_W4rri0r,2,Sun Jul 19 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"Bo1 was all Famas so it obviously doesnt count, MW3 he used the PP90 except for like 1 event"
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,RiFume,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"Scump preferred the AR in Ghosts, when the meta allowed it. Remember him saying he would like to run it, but Clay and Proof did."
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,antparkinson,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:38 2015 UTC,Okay? Id like to run sniper in Hardpoint am i a sniper even if i still use a sub? Doesnt matter what he wanted to run its what he actually did run.
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,RiFume,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:08:20 2015 UTC,No but his opinion was he was a better AR. He was very good with one.
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,antparkinson,3,Sun Jul 19 20:15:19 2015 UTC,Because as soon as you say something about Optic you get redirected by someone to the Optic sub...  Or downvoted.
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,TommyAr,5,Sun Jul 19 14:18:46 2015 UTC,"No, OG would, Karma is a very good AR, same goes for Crim and then you have Formal who is even better than the both of them. Although Scump rarely uses an AR, when he uses one you can see he totally changes his playstyle and plays far more passive."
CoDCompetitive,3dtrnj,Natsu__Dragneel,7,Sun Jul 19 13:58:19 2015 UTC,Scump actually prefers the ARs which is insane considering he's the best sub in the game

Then I stop recording after we see the final scoreboard. Upload the 20 second clip to Youtube.

The fact that Black Ops II required more thought than gunskill was arguably it's best trait. Similarly that will hopefully be the case with Black Ops III.  In Black Ops II, you could out-think and out-strategise teams. Of course gunskill was obviously an important factor too. None of this is a revelation mind you, and you completely go off track with your point and end up on a tangent almost completely unrelated to where you started."

CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,i_eat_da_booty,4,Sat Jul 18 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"The main problem I have with this argument is comparing CoD to CS:GO is apples and oranges.   Yes, it would be nice if CoD were more strategy-based, but you will not see that out of a major CoD release (unless they make one specifically geared toward eSports). Some (BO2, maybe BO3) will lean more toward the strategy side, but CoD is aimed towards the teenage userbase that has too little of an attention span to play anything other than run-and-gun."

CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,Visionary191,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. They are aimed at a general audience of FPS fans, but it gets more specific than that. CS:GO is a strategy shooter, CoD is a twitch shooter. Just saying that alone should be enough for you to realize how different these two games are.  CS:GO requires thought processing, strict planning, anticipation, game knowledge, awareness, and high levels of thinking. CoD requires high levels of gunskill, insanely good reaction times, and very basic strategies such as rotate to the next hill at ~15 seconds.  These obviously cater to 2 different audiences WITHIN the FPS audience, right? Also you can get into how CS:GO is designed for competitive play where CoD is designed for casual mess-around gaming, etc."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,OGThakillerr,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"I'd agree CoD requires great reaction times (like you said it's a twitch shooter) but I disagree it requires high levels of gunskill. Mechanically, it's a very simple game - certainly in contrast to other FPS games (even within the console market)."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,Rikuide,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"May I ask what makes you disagree with this?   From my point of view, gunskill is an enormous factor in how ""good"" you are at Call of Duty. Look at Scump for example; he undoubtedly has the best gunskill with an SMG out of any professional CoD player in the world, and he is considered by many to be the best player in the world. Formal/Clayster are neck-and-neck with the best AR gunskill in the world, and they are the best AR players in the world.   Yeah I agree that the mechanics of CoD are very simplistic, but to be great at the game your gunskill has to be great. Bearing in mind that my definition of gunskill is the following:   Gunskill involves pre-aiming, pre-firing, evasion (strafing, jump shotting), anticipating, centering, snap-shotting, and aim in general.    A lot of those are somewhat basic mechanics but they still require high levels of mastery to be considered a great CoD player."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,OGThakillerr,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:52 2015 UTC,"Before I get into my point, I want to state that I'm not someone who considers CoD to have no skill gap. I find such a position ignorant. There's clearly a difference between OG's current line up and the vast majority of opponents they face. Similarly, there's a clear difference between someone like Scump and Censor (though I do hate resorting to that cliche). But, as you said, the mechanics of CoD are very simplistic and I find the skill gap that does exist is smaller than almost any other FPS I can think of. As a result, I feel reactions times are far more important than gunskill, certainly if you look solely at the mechanic element of it, but even so if you incorporate more mental elements i.e. anticipation.  From my own point of view, gunskill in CoD is the core casual element of the game. This series is built around its pick up and play element; positional and movement penalties to accuracy are low as is recoil. On top of that you have a host of random elements that exist within the gunplay, the purpose of which is to reduce the skill gap between players and make gunfights (slightly) more even.  In most FPS games, you aim for the head (a small target) in order to secure maximum damage and kill quickly. That practice isn't present in CoD for two reasons; one) you already die quickly even with shots to centre-mass which skews the risk-reward of aiming for the head more towards the risk side, two) a flinch mechanic that causes a player's aim to kick up randomly. This coupled with gun's random recoil (which tends to be up + left/right) means that aiming for the head can often lead you off target, whilst the opponent who aims for the easy target (centre-mass) can be rewarded with a headshot. It was quite prevalent in Ghosts if I remember correctly.  Another issue with CoD is aim-assist. Now this isn't a ""CoD has auto-aim, takes no skill"" point. Aim-assist exists because analogue sticks aren't the most accurate of input methods (certainly in comparison to a mouse). However, this aim-assist affords players a larger margin of error than a mouse to compensate for the analogue stick. It's not the player's fault that they play on a less accurate control setup, but they do benefit from the aim-assist that it creates.  It's not to say there isn't gunskill of varying degrees, but I would argue that each CoD is designed in such a way as to reduce the gap between those degrees. It's a twitch shooter; ultimately reaction and touch are the two the most important elements and CoD holds your hand quite a bit when it comes to the latter."

CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,C3_Carnag3,4,Mon Jul 20 01:18:07 2015 UTC,I don't understand how the game strategy has anything to do with growth.

We shouldn't try to make CoD something it isn't. It is designed for fast paced action, lots of engagements, scorestreaks, nades, objectives, run and gunning, you name it.   There is no possible way to ever make Call of Duty ""75% strategy 25% gunskill"" unless you completely reinvent Call of Duty. If you're not gonna budge on the 75/25 idea, then you're playing the wrong game to begin with."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,OGThakillerr,2,Sat Jul 18 19:36:58 2015 UTC,Thankfully some other people see it this way! What do people think that a re-spawn heavy game entails? Black Ops 2 wasn't even that heavily influenced by strategy as most teams would do the same thing. It's clear that even in that game who ever outslayed won way more times than not.
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,sc0rching,0,Sun Jul 19 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"People look at AW, then look at BO2 and think BO2 required masterful geniuses making precise mathematical equations to invent strategies just to win games, when it isn't like that in the slightest.   Yes, BO2 did require some more thought out planning to win respawn, but never at any given time was strategy more important than gunskill in Black Ops 2. Some will argue that SnD in BO2 required more strategy as opposed to gunskill, but that isn't entirely true either. There was simply more strategy required than in respawn. If I had to give some sort of fictional ratio of strategy:gunskill I'd say SnD in BO2 was more like.. 35/65ish.  Hardpoint had a bit more strategy in BO2 than it does in AW with spawn influence, anchoring, etc. CTF had a bit more strategy in BO2 than it does in AW because of the spawn influence, spawn traps, spawn nades, etc.   People tend to overthink the ""strategy"" idea in BO2 though. They think that Hardpoint/CTF required immense amount of strategy and thinking.. meanwhile it was literally just common sense to go to the anchor spot with an assault rife, or go to cop car with an AR and spawn trap them. The strategies in BO2 and in CoD in general are extremely basic outside of SnD... like extremely basic."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,OGThakillerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:47:17 2015 UTC,"You basically put everything I was too lazy to type out haha. There's a reason we aren't a MOBA or RTS game. If you want a immense amount of strategy go check out League or Starcraft. SnD is the most strategy involved game mode because you can have set plays for every round while respawns you can too, but it is on the fly adjustments that are most important."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,sc0rching,2,Sun Jul 19 09:21:06 2015 UTC,The last part is huge if we want growth.  Banning things is not the answer.  As long as everythng has a counter it should be allowed.  Banning things makes the game stale and casual gamers dont watch it because it's not the same game they play.
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,SecKceYY,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:04:56 2015 UTC,Imo the community associates growth with how many viewers there is on the stream. That's not an accurate way to judge growth at all. The infrastructure of cod is what will drive the growth longh term and with all the event holders starting to increase prize pools and getting better venues to attract bigger crowds the scene can only keep growing.
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,Money8sKing,3,Sat Jul 18 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"The infrastructure is useless when the game sucks and the viewership is dropping, he's trying to point out eSports fans generally want to see a game with strategy which CoD completely lacks"
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,Visionary191,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"You used growth the wrong way... you talked about strategy, now growth. About your point, that's how CoD is. The game will always be more gunskill that strategy, and that's that. Even in BO2, a team of the 4 best players gunskill-wise would beat the 4 smartest players most of the time."
CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,oTc_DragonZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:16:21 2015 UTC,This game isn't going to grow as an eSport period. This is due to the fact that the whole eSports scene doesn't take us seriously due to CoD being a little kid's game. Stop expecting massive growth when its limited to consoles and is made for the casual market.

CoDCompetitive,3drfgc,Visionary191,0,Sat Jul 18 19:06:07 2015 UTC,I agree with your core points. The structure doesn't matter if the Game itself isn't fun to watch
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,hxnterrr,16,Sat Jul 18 20:01:13 2015 UTC,Bottom line as it sits RIGHT NOW. If you don't know about comp cod AT ALL you will not find comp cod. The home of eSports is on Twitch and not mlg.tv simple as that. You have to know about comp cod already to be able to watch it. So how are new players able to watch when they don't even know where to go to watch? I watch Mortal Kombat tournaments occasionally purely because it hits the front page of Twitch. If it was on it's on site I would never watch/know about a tournament being live.
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,RooLoL,3,Sat Jul 18 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"You are exactly right. MLG.tv is great for production, MLG, and prize pools, but bad for growth. They're not in the wrong for making it, they're a business. But, Twitch is what we need. Viewership has gone down because old fans are leaving at a higher rate than we're getting new fans. Ghosts and AW didn't help either. MLG.tv also keeps major orgs out of the scene because they are sponsored by Twitch. Heck, Halo has bigger orgs than CoD for this very reason and Halo gets a fraction of the viewers CoD gets."
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,oTc_DragonZ,2,Sat Jul 18 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"If MLG upped their SEO game, they could up their growth by a good bit."
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,PauseItPlease,0,Sat Jul 18 21:07:11 2015 UTC,But you have to take into account that without MLG.tv we would not have the events and the prize pools that we have at this moment in time.
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,RooLoL,9,Sat Jul 18 20:13:56 2015 UTC,What if Cod was on twitch and potential sponsors picked the scene up and offered mega prize pools. You never know what could have happened. All we know as Cod being on MLG stunts the potential for new viewers.
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,RooLoL,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"CoD was on twitch for a long time. If this was going to happen, it would have happened. Plus MLG is basically what you're describing.  What if that ""potential sponsor"" turned out to be just like MLG. Then everyone would be complaining about them, just like MLG."
CoDCompetitive,3drm5y,EyLuis,3,Sat Jul 18 20:51:59 2015 UTC,No MLG is a company that hosts and runs an event. i'm talking about an actual sponsor who sponsors the event/prize. Example: The Google 125k (just an example).
CoDCompetitive,3do2si,redditu53r,37,Fri Jul 17 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"I'll put the events in basic tiers:    CoD Champs - Massive prize pool, head and shoulders above all else in terms of money. The failings being that it's in the middle of the games life cycle, and it's a promotional event for Activision.  MLG World Championship - to be held for the first time ever in October. Fills in what Champs lacks, it's at the end of the life cycle and will polish off the year, but it has a smaller prize pool than Champs.     General MLG events and Gfinity Masters events - these are your typical mid-range prize pool events. All the teams really want to win them but they're not quite at the level of the last two events.    UMG events - bad production quality, but decent prize pool. All the top teams attend them but they're never quite as serious (of course everyone still wants to win)  ESWC - comes along once a year and has a few teams that will be rolled over every year, but the prize pool is good. Production is good to and the teams that make the cut always enjoy it.   Gfinity Open, EGL and Am2Pro events - most of the top tier teams in Europe still attend them, so they're quite good quality in terms of the competition. Lower prize pool than EU masters though so not quite as important.     Other events - your MES's, UGC's, AEL's and the likes. Usually mostly attended by amateur teams because most pro teams aren't bothered by the smaller prize pools. The ams who go are well up for them but they're not considered to be anywhere near as important.    Online tournaments - 2K, 5K and 10K tournaments are weekly online tournaments that aren't taken seriously because online is flukey as hell    Denial LAN - because it's not happening  Edit: added more European events"

CoDCompetitive,3do2si,iiEviNii,2,Fri Jul 17 22:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'd put it under General MLG, maybe slightly above."
CoDCompetitive,3do2si,EpicOne1337,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"I think for now, X-Games is above general MLG due to the fact that there are so many pros that have yet to win a medal of any kind. I'd imagine that the drive to win is much higher, especially since there was money in addition to the medal this year (and I would assume in coming years)."
CoDCompetitive,3do2si,hxnterrr,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:52:31 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like X Games > Worlds.  Just for the simple fact that medals are up for grabs.

CoDCompetitive,3do2si,Lympathy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"An X-games gold medal is quite prestigious, just because there is no money doesn't mean the pro's really want one. Just look at the Olympics, you don't earn money but it is highly sought after. Also the prestige can open up more opportunities particularly in the commercial world which extends beyond the regular CoD tournaments. I think you are highly underrating it due to pure prize-pool but that is most likely just a personal preference and doesn't necessarily reflect the broader view."

CoDCompetitive,3do2si,Nateblah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:32:03 2015 UTC,"Umg, MLG, Gfinity are tournament organizers that host most of the major tournaments in Call of duty(MLG>Gfinity>UMG in quality, but it the prize pool usually decides how ""important"" the event is.) Usually anything by them is going to be a major that all of the pro teams are going to be going to. There will also every once in a while be large tournaments held by other tournament organizers(ESWC, Cod Champs, UGC Niagara) that the pro teams will go to. They usually will only go to tournaments with prize pools above 25k. You can look at the Calendar for all of the announced events so far. Along with LAN events, there are also the weekly 2k tournaments on saturdays and 5k tournaments on sundays where teams compete for money and pro points. Pro points are used to qualify for some LAN events, and are also used for seeding in non-MLG league tournaments(Online and on LAN.) You can get pro points from online tournaments(2ks/5ks/10ks and other smaller tournaments.), LAN events, and the MLG pro league. The MLG league is where 12 of the top COD teams play scheduled matches over the course of a few months to gain a place at the MLG playoff tournaments, and secure a spot in the next league."

I asked them to delay it until Monday because I wouldn't be in work at delivery time and they said that's no problem. Idiots didn't bother doing it. SIM arrived today, I'm in work on the other side of the city, half an hour drive from my house, and I have absolutely no phone coverage. No service whatsoever because I still have my other networks SIM, and I'm not going to be home for like another 10 hours. Morons. Absolute morons. So I'm busy scabbing off Tesco's free wifi. Hype."

Also, I think the main reason that I'm not liking AW as much is because people can get out of my field of vision VERY quickly in close quarters, which makes me even more excited for 1) Black Ops 3 and 2) backwards compatibility so I can play Black Ops 2 on my XBOne :)"

CoDCompetitive,3dn167,Predictist,20,Fri Jul 17 16:27:45 2015 UTC,"So, just to ELI5: Yes it could help you but only under certain circumstances. Imagine a highway on which a bunch of cars are going to different places. Some are going to the baseball game, some are going to the club, , and some are going to Sledgehammer HQ. Equate your XBox data to cars going to Sledgehammer. Someone streaming Netflix at your house is represented by cars going to the baseball game. And your brother masturabting to PornHub, his data is  going to the club.  There is only so many cars that can get on the highway at one time. Well, what the nighthawk does is create a lane for your cars to get to Sledgehammer unimpeded. That's what QoS does. It prioritizes your data (or whatever data you configure to be prioritized) to ""get through the highway"" first in front of the other cars in the road.  So, if you have a local network where you're fighting for bandwidth with a lot of other users, it may work for you in theory. Realistically, though? It won't really make a difference because you have a pretty damn good connection already, and the QoS you'd get from a Nighthawk wouldn't make much of a difference if at all.  Like, would you really need a specific lane for your cars to get to Sledgehammer if no one else is on the road?"
CoDCompetitive,3dn167,bastitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:58 2015 UTC,I have like a 2 in 1 modem and router. Does it make a difference to have them separate?
CoDCompetitive,3dn167,bastitch,9,Fri Jul 17 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. Fundamentally, one or two devices doesn't matter.    A couple things just to point out that I didn't get to earlier:    You'll never really get the advertised speeds as listed by your ISP.  It's a theoretical top speed, not an actual. Ping is actually a better measurement of how fast your XBox can respond as it pertains to gaming. In your case, I think your Internet connection is fine. ISP modems and routers are typically lower grade or economy level modems and routers. I would always suggest purchasing a new one after a while to replace the ISP provided device. While I didn't experience any improvement for my hardwired devices after upgrading to an Asus router, my wireless devices experienced significant speed improvements, mostly because of better signal strength. You typically want to stay away from anything branded as ""gaming"" anything. It's very gimmicky and the technology it implements is usually available by regular, non-gaming branded devices. From a technology standpoint, this is all really simple stuff at the very bare bones of it. There's no magic device that will make your Internet ""God Internet"".    Hope this helps."
CoDCompetitive,3dn167,12temp,0,Fri Jul 17 18:18:58 2015 UTC,btw thats called a gateway (modem/router in one)

CoDCompetitive,3dn167,Rikuide,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"That only pertains to internal network speeds.  A cat 3 cable supports speeds greater then 150mbps which is the slowest link he has.  Your connection is only as fast as its slowest connection to a hop.  Since his internet is 120mbps, a cat 3 cable would be just as good as cat 5e.  If your playing on your lan or transfering files to a node inside your network then the cat 5e cable will make a difference because your slowest link is likely 1000mbps or 1gbps.  However, nobody uses cat 3 anymore so his cable is likely just fine."

The fact that your not getting your full speed most likely means your either not getting the speeds your isp claims, your modem/router is faulty, or your running cat4 cable over a really long distance.  You can probably rule the last one out.  I would say ask your isp for another router (assuming your renting or it has awarranty) and see if thats the issue.  If that isnt possible or doesnt work go to walmart and get a high end router and try it out.  If it fixes the issue then you know your problem, if it doesnt then your isp isnt giving you what your paying for....demand a big discount and get the issues resolved."

This probably stems from his past, and that's fine to a degree, but at this point I'm starting to feel that Parasite is a lost cause. He lets his (far and away) past experience as a champ cloud his standards, and doesn't realize that this coupled with his unarguably toxic attitude makes for a combination that will result with failure after failure.   Case in point: Parasite needs to grow the fuck up, and probably needs to get the fuck off twitter if he wants to continue CoD as a career."

CoDCompetitive,3dnw26,Poncho_TheGreat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"Play on the sensitivity you find comfortable. I run on a 3 with claw, and can map kids with a sub. I can also play a 6, but I can only hit short-medium range, and medium is eh for me. When I get a Cinch and KFs, I'm turning my sensitivity up to a 6, because I'm comfortable with a 6 with KFs.   Generally, a 3-4 is the best sensitivity range because you can keep a steady shot, and a 4 is honestly fast enough to turn on people pretty easily. 3 is iffy on turn-ons, but they're definitely possible. It literally all depends on what you are comfortable with. If you can keep a steady aim at range with a high sensitivity, too, KEEP IT. It's FAR better than a low sensitivity if you can control it at range too!"
CoDCompetitive,3dnw26,iMewtilate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:39:53 2015 UTC,i am a firm believer that if you can be accurate w/ a high sensitivity in COD that is the best thing possible esp for competitive.  counterstrike it totally different.  on PC with 5 players and slower game you need a low low sensitivity to be competitive.  but in a game like COD even when BO3 comes out a high sensitivity is deadly if you can be accurate with it.

CoDCompetitive,3dnw26,MrDeepro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"This might sound strange but I recently found out that my shot isn't really that different playing on like a 5-6 sens compared to playing on 3. The Conclusion being that sens might not necessarily improve your shot that much.  and there's other reasons your shot isn't good.  When it comes to my shot, my natural ability, amount of time I play the game and the fact I can't get used to the loose Xbox one sticks are bigger factors when it comes to my shaky shot then the sensitivity I play on."
CoDCompetitive,3dnw26,pac1cap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:49 2015 UTC,"i have changed my sensitivity so many times for so many different reasons. my high was 8 in mw3 (16 in today's cod games [ghosts and aw]) and 12 in BLOPS2. i currently play on 6 (3 in mw3 and before and 4 in BLOPS2). the difference is i can tell are i can't turn as quickly (duh) so i can't get easier kills on people who are out of my peripheral vision. also, once you get used to a sensitivity, you're aim is at its best, depending on what 'at its best' is for you."
CoDCompetitive,3dnw26,wildchild829,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:19:47 2015 UTC,You can make smaller adjustments with a lower sens. Other wise if you are shooting just to the side sometimes you move too far to the other and then back and then miss a lot of shots. Higher senses allow you to turn on people easier but most of the time if you're getting shot from behind you're dead anyway so I like lower sense. All the way through MW3 I played on higher sens.

CoDCompetitive,3djvme,BasedGodCrim,17,Fri Jul 17 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"Let's be real here, most were skeptical of AW from the trailers and gameplay. Looked like such a different game and it wasn't until we got pros' opinions did we start to view the game as potentially good. I can't even imagine from a casual fans perspective how they'd view the game from the trailers, probably didn't even want to touch CoD with all the jumping and dashing. Not to mention it was SH's first CoD and most didn't know how well they'd succeed at it.   BO3 looks a lot more traditional and given the success of BO2, preorders will almost definitely be much higher than AW."
CoDCompetitive,3djvme,FlowseL,9,Thu Jul 16 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"I think there's still a fair amount of worry about BO3's pseudo-exos. BO3 will be boosted by series staples such as Zombies (true zombies, not AW's version of it). But the single biggest factor has to be the beta; it's the most tangible pre-order bonus we've had in years and it's little wonder pre-orders are noticeably higher. Worse case scenario you cancel the pre-order (perhaps losing a deposit)."
CoDCompetitive,3djvme,Rikuide,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"For sure.  While I don't deny that the huge surge in pre-orders this early in the stage is mostly due to the beta, I can't help but think of the 40% of my friends list that are casual (read: non-competitive) die-hard Call of Duty players that haven't played as much since Black Ops 2. We're talking guys in their 20's and even 30's that have been part of the COD army, pre-ordering the game, lining up on release night, taking days off from work, and playing 30 days per game cycle. Those kind of pub players.  Some were turned off by the quick  TTK and lack of strong killstreaks in Ghosts. Some were turned off the the movement in AW and how they couldn't be immediately good at the game. But all of them are really hoping they can get behind Black Ops 3 and get back into the swing of what that subset of COD players. A lot of those guys pre-ordered the game because of that.  Black Ops 2 was phenomenal for competitive Call of Duty, but it was also an awesome game for pub players. While I don't doubt the beta had a lot to do with pre-orders, don't discount how Black Ops 2 reputation affected this as well with pub players (which you have to keep reminding yourself in the sub, is the far majority of the community)."

CoDCompetitive,3dn31o,ARES_X,6,Sat Jul 18 08:44:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. this is always an interesting question because of how subjective it is, especially reaction time. It is very difficult/impossible to get into a player’s head and understand exactly what he knows about a situation. So you can never be sure that he is reacting to a completely unknown stimulus or if he is primed whilst doing so or simply predicting based on awareness. But I’ll give it a shot- I try to base much of my opinion on what other pros think, given they have actually competed against one another over uncountable permutations.  Reaction Time: Right now? It is probably Scump. He has always been at or near the top of the list ever since MW2. Historically, Aches has competed with him for that title. I think that’s another bit of information that everyone knows. Aches’ shitty host combined with his reaction time allowed him to absolutely destroy some teams online back in his heyday.  A darkhorse would be Rambo. Back in the original Black Ops (and possibly before this) the “Rambo Knife” was a pretty known expression. This was back before Scufs were a thing, but the man could outknife anyone given equal footing. To be fair, he was likely primed to react with his knife before using his gun so that may influence things. However, there is a reason why, in spite of his shitty gunskill, that he’d be able to outgun some of the very best players 1v1 even if he didn’t get the jump on them. Ol’ Ray was one of the quickest at going from seeing an enemy to snapping his right stick in their direction, but after that instant is where things usually broke down for him.  Gunskill: At the moment, it has to be Formal, right? Watching his sniping in Halo Reach was a treat- you knew the man could center instantaneously. And now in CoD, if you watch his point of view, his control over his weapon in so many different situations just feels different than other players. Even though he has become much more twitchy in AW, there’s a steadiness to his shot. He can still get flustered in hectic gunfights, and I am sure there are some players that are better shots in these scenarios, but overall my opinion is based on just how unique among players that his shot appears to be.  If we turn back time a bit, I loved watching Proofy’s shot from MW2 all the way to MW3. Formal’s gunskill may be unique, but Proofy’s was beautiful. Put an AR in his hands and everything was so smooth. It didn’t matter how far away the enemy was or what headglitch they were on because, in your head, you just knew Proof was going to center on him perfectly.   Two other guys I’d like to mention are Jkap and Fears. We all know Kap was a monster in MW2 and BO and his gunskill was obviously a huge part of that. What stuck out to me was, before Formal, I had never seen a player with such steady right stick control. Everyone one strafe onto a target with their left stick, but Kap had great control over moving his right thumb the tiniest of distances.  As for Fears, I think his is both obvious and surprising. To those that have been following CoD for a while, you should know that Fears is a fucking monster aimer. The guy is one of the dumbest killwhores to ever play the game, but there’s a reason why Aches and Teep teamed with him so often. If you give and expect no responsibility out of him then you can sit back and watch him tear apart the other team through superior gunskill alone. I really haven’t seen enough him over the years to truly have an opinion, but he was certainly one of the best on reputation and results alone."

CoDCompetitive,3dn31o,OutOfCurry,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt say Attach and Zooma always come to mind when someone mentions gunskill. Also, inb4 some makes a comment about Zooma cheating vs tK"

I'm also interested in Royalty, from what I've heard he uses a regular controller on 12-14 sens. which is actually amazing - admittedly, I haven't watched much of him, outside of the odd LAN PoV, but he'd have to be good playing like that."
