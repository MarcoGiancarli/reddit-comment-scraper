nova,3e2yp8,AllHailKingStannis,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"That is probably ~2 mile walk on the W&OD trail?  I mean, right now it sucks hard because it is hot, but should be doable?  But that would be like a 30 minutes walk?  I'd suggest not wearing work clothes and changing in the office after cooling down/drying off.  As for the bus, here is the bus timings pdf.  What time do you go to work?  Catch the 7:33am bus and get to RTC at 7:44, which gives enough time to mosey over to wherever your office is.  Is you are a 9am-er, then the 8:33 arriving at 8:44 should work."
nova,3e2yp8,phat1forever,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:13 2015 UTC,Leave a bike at the Wiehle Metro and you can go back and forth between the two in 10 minutes or so.  I'd almost guarantee that's faster than a bus. Mileage is short enough that you probably won't break too much of a sweat. You can lock up at their secure bike facility if you'd like.
nova,3e2yp8,jts5009,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:53 2015 UTC,That is a great idea. Apparently leaving it there isn't so expensive so it'd save me having to wait (and pay for) a bus. Definitely going to do this whenever the weather allows.

After they are done with your hair they use a straight razor and warm shaving cream to trim your neck and sideburns and then rub it off with a hot towel. It is also around $15. Downside is the fact that is it not as stylish as a salon but for a barbershop i give it a recommendation.

When I first started going, I got done really good haircuts, even got over my haircut anxiety a bit. Lately, I think they're regressing to the mean, and I don't know if I recommend it as much. I think it's possible that they have some stylists who open stores as a hook, and then get moved to the next new store and lower-cost replacements fill in.  In all honesty, it's more out-of-date emo than hipster. I do feel a little old there, but there are a couple of forty-something guys who show up occasionally, so I think I'm still ok."

I disagree with /u/Understated_rye's conspiracy theory about purposefully downgrading the stylists. A place like Floyd's is more like a farm team for the plethora of high-end salons around the area, and so after about a year of paying their dues the more talented stylists are naturally going to move on.  That being said, there's a guy named Andrew there now who came from one of the salons in Tyson's II, said he couldn't stand the snooty clientele, and gives a pretty damn good haircut. So I don't really see a shortage of talent at all, just a normal turnover rate and a store simply going through the motions more now that all the buzz around them is gone."

nova,3dqpfv,telmnstr,8,Sun Jul 19 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"Good point.  I've wondered that myself.  To me, the scenario would support the prices going down. Of course, I'd also think the stagnant wages would have tempered prices today, but it hasn't.  So who knows?   As you point out, overall wages have not kept pace with housing prices.  I have 50-60 year old colleagues who live in Arlington and they laugh at the idea that they could afford to buy their home today.  If they didn't buy in 1995, they wouldn't be there.  They will almost certainly want to sell and move somewhere less expensive once the nest is empty and they are retired.  The large number of federal employees here means that one of the typical obstacles for many Boomers to retire, the fact they have no retirement savings, isn't a factor.  Quite a few are still on CSRS retirement, and even the FERS retirees get a pension, albeit a less generous one.    So assume a solid percentage of them will finally retire and won't be staying in the area.  You could potentially have a large number of homes hitting the market in a short period of time.  The jobs, especially the federal jobs, aren't necessarily being backfilled with some younger person.    Even if they were being filled 1:1, the salaries don't cut it for that single-family house in Arlington your old, now retired, boss is selling.  A privileged few of the younger folks have the resources to buy that place, but most don't.   So you'd potentially have a healthy supply, with few who can afford it.  It should drive prices down, but I'll believe it when I see it."

While wages have stagnated nationally, the cost of living in most places hasn't risen as dramatically as it has in the northern Virginia area. Living in Topeka probably costs about the same as it did 15 years ago, but you can't say that about Northern Virginia.  The crux of the situation is whether the wage growth in this area has kept pace with the increasing cost of living (namely real estate.) You can't look at one and ignore the other.  Since we now have small, old houses which are selling for four or five times what the same property would cost elsewhere, it's reasonable to ask whether the wage difference compensates for this. The general consensus seems to be no."

The areas close to town were built out earlier so the houses will be older; that's just the way it works.  When they built Melpar on Route 50 in Falls Church (now Raytheon; just inside the Beltway) in the 1940s, it was way the hell out in the middle of nowhere.  The growth in this area has made it close in.  There's demand for close-in housing from people who want to cut the time and gas they burn commuting.

I think the general upkeep will probably hurt them. All the skinny townhouses with stairs? Not great for older people and falls are one of the huge threats to the elderly.   Also, I rent a townhouse that I guess the neighbors try to sell like units in the $475-$500K+ range. The construction quality is pretty poor. I think it was built in 2002 to 2004 and pretty much all of the appliances have failed once, water fixtures leak.

I don't think buying a house is ever easy. But I think a LOT of people have an expectation of buying a house like their parents have, vs a starter home. They're usually miles apart.  Edit: everyone can downvote simple facts all you want, but being bitter doesn't make you right. I bought a home over 350 making less than 70k with more than 70k in student loans and only put 3.5% down with an FHA.  I was 26. But wtf would I know right?"
nova,3dqpfv,ciabattabing16,6,Sun Jul 19 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"It's actually a lot tougher for anybody to afford a house in this area, young or otherwise.  Housing prices have inflated dramatically over the past twenty years.  Here's an anecdote: through coincidence I live in the same neighborhood where my parents bought their first house in the 1980s.  They were able to buy a small two bedroom rowhouse (i.e., the perfect starter home) for about $75,000, which is about $221,000 in today's dollars.  That is a little less than I paid for my small one-bedroom condo a couple years ago, which also has $300+ monthly association fees on top of my mortgage payment.  Other similar rowhouses to my parents' first one in the neighborhood are now going for between $500,000-$600,000.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with condos--we live an a rapidly urbanizing area after all--but FHA has stricter requirements on owner-occupier ratios than conventional loans, and many condo associations that could be considered solid starter home candidates in the region can not be purchased using FHA loans.  With housing prices shooting up rental rates are rising as well, so people tend to hold on to their first condos and rent them out rather than sell, and that tendency makes it even tougher to get a loan."
nova,3dqpfv,fatbottomedgirls,2,Mon Jul 20 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"You are also missing another key piece of the puzzle: interest rates. In the early 1980's the interest rate for a mortage was between 10-18%. If the current interest rate was 15%, I bet house prices would be lower. At 3-4% interest rate borrowing money is cheap, so people can afford to borrow way more money. So...a starter home in September of 1981  was $221,000 (in today's money) with an 18% rate is a monthly payment of $3,315.59 (todays money). Today, you can buy a nice starter home for $650,000 in with a  4% interest rate and your monthly payment... $3,300."
nova,3dqpfv,potlucker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:48 2015 UTC,"That is a really good point.  There is definitely an inverse relationship with interest rates and housing prices.  However, my example was from 1985, and that year the average prime rate was 12.43%, which would put your monthly payment on a $75,000 mortgage at $796, which is $1,765.39 in 2015 dollars. If that same property sold for $550,000 today the mortgage payment would be $2,619 at last month's 3.98% prime rate.  That's more than $850 per month more in today's dollars for your mortgage payment, which is going to be pretty significant for a younger person.  I would take the higher interest rate an an extra $850 per month in my pocket any day.  The other side of the story is how high rent costs eat in to everyone's ability save.  For the sake of argument we can probably pretty safely say that monthly rent prices roughly track monthly mortgage payment prices.  If real rent is $10,000 more per year than it was in 1985 (in 2015 dollars) that's an extra $40,000 you would not be able to save towards a down payment if you start working at 21 and try to purchase a house at 25."
nova,3dqpfv,fatbottomedgirls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"So...is housing actually that much more expensive now when you adjust for inflation and combine lower interest rates? There are plenty of single family homes inside the beltway for <$500k..(sort of regularly see sub $400k single family homes...) putting your monthly payment at that  $2,300 level in todays money for the 500k or $1,900 for a 400k. So it is just the down payment that is the issue? Not sure about your parents, but people tended to actually put 20% down when buying in that timeframe...how did they manage? They would have put down $44,000 (20% of the house at ""todays dollars"" $221,000). FHA loans are relatively easy to acquire, and you could put down 3.5% ($17,500, or half the older generation) and pay PMI.

nova,3dqpfv,potlucker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:28 2015 UTC,Re-read my post.  I did my math incorrectly the first time--I should have calculated the nominal mortgage payment in 1985 and then adjusted it up.  I edited it and it's correct now.
nova,3dqpfv,fatbottomedgirls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"Either way, the numbers are close enough. In 1984 you could pay $1,765 in 2015 dollars for a 2 bedroom row house and that was a good deal for a starter home. You can still get a single family home for within a few hundred dollars of that a month inside the beltway....but I understand that is $200 more a month. You can get a townhouse for ~200-250k still inside the beltway. So a $900-$1,100 a month mortgage.  I agree that housing in this area is proportionately more expensive than it was, but I'm still not sure it's really as crazy and unachievable as people seem to think it is...when taking into account interest rates and inflation."
nova,3dqpfv,potlucker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"The example I've been working off of is instructive because it's looking at the exact same house and demonstrates that it costs $850 more per month than it used to.

Since I don't have at the moment,  I am inserting instead into the conversation ""inside the beltway"" which is a broad area, but people tend to feel (I think correctly) is a fairly expensive area of NOVA for starter homes. I can with relative ease find some residences that would appear to carry equivalent mortgages to their 1980ish adjusted mortgages, for example, 4520 King St APT 303, Alexandria, VA 22302 sold for $44,500 in 1985 ($458 a month 12% mortgage- $1050 2015 dollars, and sold for $194,000 in 2014- $950 a month mortgage payment.

But try selling a home without stainless appliances, granite/stone counters, and straight wood/finished cabinets. Can you? Absolutely. But the higher demand is for modernized kitchens and baths.  In reverse, home buyers are looking fort those upgrades. For a starter home, that's unrealistic. But if you're young and you've always had these kinds of upgrades you don't know what to expect.   Modernizing homes drives up market price (which is different than actual value). You can add value to a home easily just from upgrades and repairs with modern crap.  Edit: not to say land and other stuff isn't a factor. For sure it is, it's a limited resource."
nova,3dqpfv,ciabattabing16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"To me keeping your kitchen and bath on trend is basic maintenance.  It's always been tougher selling a place without on-trend aesthetics.  Just a few year ago everyone wanted deep stained kitchen cabinets, but white is currently in high demand.  Same with the bathroom--oak was a big thing, what, 20 years ago?  For a while there black appliances were all the rage.  Five years from now everyone might be chucking their stainless steel in favor of white again.  Evolving trends are nothing new in the real estate market and those same market dynamics have always been part of the equation."
nova,3dqpfv,fatbottomedgirls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it definitely drives the price up.  When I was renting a condo, black appliances were all the rage with granite countertops.  By the time I was house hunting, those were old hat, and it was on to the recycled stainless steel appliances and polished concrete or not-granite but looks like granite tops.  It's weird.  But, out of the affordable homes I saw, the one I bought was 42k cheaper, 50k if you count my negotiating down.  It was/is a great starter home...and had absolutely zero of the trendy things.  The latest updates to anything were from the 80s.  That said, I've put some work into it (by work I mean calling real men because I know fuck all about how to man things).  New appliances, 100% new doors and windows, attic and crawlspace insulation, some electrical and plumbing repairs, installation of ceiling fans, and I'll be wrapping up this year with deck maintenance, replacing the hot tub, and new laundry room appliances.  I still will 100% need at least 1 totally new bathroom and most of the kitchen.  Both are fine, but need work, and when you rip out something you're going to have to full gut it because it's been layered on over the years.  But that's a starting home.  It's move in ready, but I had to really REALLY walk down my expectations of what an affordable home would be.  The homes I thought I'd get were like 500-600k, and that was in the middle of the mortgage crash.  It was definitely a rescoping of my expectations.  But I hate threads that discourage younger people from buying a home, because it's totally doable, even with the market on the up and up.  It is what it is cost wise here, but like a college degree, it's what you make of it.  If you think it through, sacrifice some things for the bigger picture, it pays off in spades."
nova,3dqpfv,ciabattabing16,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:36 2015 UTC,"But I think a LOT of people have an expectation of buying a house like their parents have, vs a starter home.   I think plenty of millennials have reasonable expectations for a starter home, it's just that those homes aren't available to them.  I would love to buy a modest house that hasn't been updated since the 80s for a fair price.  Unfortunately every house that meets that description is going to be snapped up by developers with a cash offer the instant it hits that market so that they can put 100K of upgrades into it and flip it as a ""luxury"" home for 200K+ what they bought it for.    You can make all the 3.5% FHA offers on starter homes you want, but none of them are going to get accepted."

nova,3dqpfv,archmcd,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:34:37 2015 UTC,Having a home is an important part of retirement. Do you really want to be paying rent/mortgage after you retire?
nova,3dqpfv,ciabattabing16,0,Sat Jul 18 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"Since you're in a similar field, I can guestimate, depending on how long you've been an SA, that you're probably at about 50-60k (varying largely on experience obviously).  A home is actually feasible for you, but you'd have to consider something outside of a traditional mortgage, and outside of a centralized urban zone (Places like Reston or Fairfax cities, or Clarendon, places like that would be out of reach).  Considering your field and the market in this area for it, the general pay rates, you'd probably be looking at homes between 300-400k, again higher or lower based on many factors.  There's a LOT of homes in that range, but you have to give up things like walkable distance to Metro (or major bus routes, there's buses in the suburbs but main lines may/may not be easily hit, I honestly don't know), and local neighborhood 'shops'.  You'll have to drive to the store, drive to work, that kind of thing.  But don't be discouraged you're in a fantastic field for this area and it's 100% doable to buy if you get the ducks herded and in a row."

A house is a huge investment, its not something that you just go out and buy whenever you feel up to it, it requires lots and lots of planning. Save up the money for it first and then go for it. Ok 120k is a lot of money but over the course of two years would it really be that hard to save that much if youre already making 150k? I think not."

nova,3dpmyn,mydogbuddha,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"They may have not thought ahead in reviewing.  It is summer and so no heavy coats or hoodies.  An iPad is not really so small to go in a pocket, so if you know the time it was missing, you review the exit cams for someone carrying or concealing an object.  An odd man out so to speak. When you have that description, you go back and review the same doors for people entering, get a face and better description. You have a suspect.    That all said, I do know the typical layout of the stores and cams. I used to work for them in a job that dealt with this.  With no great conceal coats spotting a suspect is not that difficult. The person may have found a way to hide it well, but most who do such theft are caught on cam if you just look.    I have caught direct employee theft and some of the other creative ways people hide things.   These days I have no contact with the company as I have moved on to other fields, but you may want to request that Loss Prevention review the recording as they are trained to see behavior and know how people do that stuff.  If the store stalls, call the 800 Safeway number and ask a CSR on the phone to email the District Manager for that store as well as Loss Prevention that covers the store.  Technically, the manager broke protocol showing you the footage, but managers are there to make money for the company and keep customers happy, Loss Prevention deals with this.  A District Manager can put pressure to get it done."
