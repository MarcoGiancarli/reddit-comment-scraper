dcss,3e65z3,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:36:10 2015 UTC,"To avoid being a panicked key-mashing crawler comes with experience. You need to be pessmistic about enemy encounters. Yellow and red named monsters namely. It isn't even about ""Will I make it out alive?"" but rather ""Will I have to spend key consumables to win the fight?"". Try to postpone such encounters for when you are more leveled up.       Now that's out of the way, let's talk about when shit hits the fan. You should consider that the shit is starting to piling up once your HP drops to 50% and the main threat is at 70%. Also, consider that you are going to be in trouble if your HP drops to 50%, and the main threat is at 40% but there are some ranged monsters with los towards you (I say ranged because, ideally, you want to face threats in a 1on1 melee fight). When things start to look grim gain the habit of pushing 'i' to check your not so critical consumables like scrolls of fear, potions of invisibility, might and agility. These become more useless as mobs get more MR or when mobs start to get see invisible. If you think you will still be in trouble anyway it is time to use the critical escape items. Nets, blinks, teleportation, heal wounds. Also, don't be stingy on your consumables. An adventurer with a low amount of consumables is better than a dead one.         Then there are the escapes. Ideally, you want to go upstairs to rest, but more often than not the stairs are far away from you. This is also pretty critical if the previous floor was infested with uniques. And the tip is, try to be mindful and take a quick peek at the downstairs. Sometimes knowing before hand that that downstairs leads you to a safe place saves you some consumables."
dcss,3e65z3,MacBadoo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:45:42 2015 UTC,"How do you avoid panicked key-mashing?   As an FPS/RTS player, I found this insanely difficult. So difficult, in fact, that I had to add like 200 force_more_message lines to my config. A bunch of little mandatory pauses gradually taught me to treat crawl like the turn based game it is. I may remove them eventually but for now I still tend to lapse into button mashing when frustrated, which... is bad.  Don't be too sparing with your consumables. Eventually when you've played long enough, you'll realize it's possible to actually farm consumables in Abyss/Pandemonium, and it's all just a matter of surviving and character building long enough to get there. You also realize that some scrolls, like fear, and some wands/potions, like invisibility, begin rapidly losing their utility once you hit, say, Depths. So it's actually better to burn them early and often.  Having said that, it's easy for me to say such lessons, hard to actually impart them. I find that the most valuable lessons in Crawl can only truly be learned via hindsight and regret. Such is the torturous nature of the roguelike."

Just get a base unenchanted decent weapon [demon trident/blade/whip, double sword, eveningstar, heck even morningstar or scimitar will do] and then pump all your enchant weapon scrolls on it, along with a scroll of branding. Alternatively an elemental staff will also do, although you'll face problems with immune enemies [not with staff of earth though].  Going for firestorm asap with a demigod - I don't like it. You don't even need it to win. OoD, poison arrow and freezing cloud [for example] would carry you to a win just fine.  Get a buckler. Then get more defence [fighting/dodging]. Get a dragon armor later, quicksilver ideally.  Since you're already so heavily into fire, consider ring of flames. It's a fun spell, surrounds you with a mobile flame cloud shield that burns all kinds of shit."
dcss,3e2tgz,T0lias,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"Once a weapon has been leveled up ring of flames is a great idea since the OP is already on rC++.

dcss,3e2tgz,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:18 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Also memorize Spectral Weapon to increase melee damage output if you have it. It has good synergy with polearms as it can hit your opponent next to you even from behind your back.  Other useful melee weapons would be staves, if you've happened to find a useful one, especially a lajatang. It has synergy with the enhancer staves; a staff of fire or earth in combination of decent evoc skill would double as a useful melee weapon.  But the vampiric brand is good too for a huge chunk of the game."
dcss,3e2tgz,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:30 2015 UTC,"As a side note, an acquirement scroll would have a 50% chance of giving you a staff of fire, which would be a decent melee weapon as well as a fire magic enhancer. You already have 2/3 of the big wands, and could learn Haste as a spell, so it wouldn't be a bad thing to try to acquire, were you to find a scroll.  And recharge your healing wand ASAP."
dcss,3e2tgz,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"You value the power of your character in the future too much.  You need to play less greedy and make yourself powerful for right now.  That way you are more likely to actually see the future.  So pick up the first decent melee option you find and start leveling it and enchant.  If you later luck out and find a good randart that shares that skill you can switch.  If you find a cool randart in a different category then thems the breaks.  And use your enchant armour scrolls.  If you want to wait for a better body armour thats fine but there's no reason to have unused enchant scrolls when you have auxiliary slots that aren't maxed out.  There's plenty of enchant scrolls in the game anyways.  Another greed problem is your Firestorm focus and that is costing your skill development in melee and defenses.  This is a classic noob-trap and will get you killed. In a typical mage build you should probably have it castable sometime after your 3rd rune, and it's not really needed to win the game."

I think Mahkleb is similar with a heal and good offensive powers, but he requires invocations to work and I would switch to TSO for extended. there is a guide somewhere for VSTr of Ash, I've never played with ash but it might work.  Skill wise I put xp into fighting and UC until I found a book with stoneskin and statue form in, which I used 90% of the time throughout the game. From there the next spell to get rolling was haste and phase shift, then dragon form (which I ended up using only twice, vs cerebov and asmodeus.) I would have learned controlled blink but never found it. Also repel missiles would've been great but I sacrificed air. I would only sacrifice arcana if it didn't have earth, charms or transmutations so I was quite lucky."

dcss,3dyb4z,Slogo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:10 2015 UTC,I've heard some people say it's better to stay with dodging and light armor with a gargoyle due to their natural AC boosting. What do you think?
dcss,3dyb4z,xio88,3,Mon Jul 20 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"I can't say, because I haven't tried that. I will say that with 73 AC you don't really care much what hits you. In the late game, the only thing that did more than trivial damage to me was hellfire."
dcss,3dyb4z,Slogo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"I tend to not agree with that. Gargoyles have terrible dex (no natural dex growth) which means both that you'll end up with high str naturally and that you'll never have great dex. So your dodging is always going to be pretty mediocre. 70 AC with the boosted GDR is enough to handle most things hitting you even with terrible EV.  To me, if you go for light armor as a gargoyle its because you want to cast spells better. Dodging is just a result of that choice."

dcss,3dwtlk,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:21 2015 UTC,"Also, train dodging. Seriously, whats it with you guys/gals here on /r/dcss and not training dodging? I will spend at least half of lair on dodging on non-armour chars and typically even more."
dcss,3dwtlk,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Mon Jul 20 06:56:55 2015 UTC,I think it has to do with low dex characters. The EV gains on low dex are low so many think the XP would be better placed elsewhere.  I'm in the dodge camp though. It's always worth to train SOME dodge.
dcss,3dwtlk,robbcorp26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:35 2015 UTC,I think it's sort of acceptable for a gargoyle caster type.  Decent AC + GDR in robes (or better GDR in general) is a huge defensive boost for caster types and gargoyles have terrible dex with no dex growth so your returns on dodging aren't great.  Doubly so in this case with Regen+++ also helping out.  In my mind that's sort of the balance of gargoyle casters. You trade terrible dex and ok but not great int & apts for the ability to skimp on defensive skills because you'll get a decent AC 'for free'.  Besides if the OP cursed their cloak they'd get a much bigger dodging boost. Though I'd still raise it at least to 10 base dodging.
dcss,3dwtlk,Slogo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yep cheers, but that doesn't really answer the question. I'd like to be able to curse the item if possible, so I want to minimize swapping it. I know the +7 laj is good. But is it better damage output than a +12 qstaff though? What about a staff of earth at 27 Earth magic (which I now have)? This is the question."
dcss,3dwtlk,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:30:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't curse the main weapon, as the skill boost is secondary to the damage boost you get from being able to switch to the best brand on demand."
dcss,3dwtlk,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:57 2015 UTC,"+7lajatang has better output than a 12 quarterstaff, even though with slaying thats closer than one would think.   However, since you now have 27 earth, the enhancer staff is of course better since you can use a shield with it. Also get a bit of evocations, evo counts into damage as well."
dcss,3dwtlk,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:49 2015 UTC,"Stop training Polearms. You're already 2.7 levels (around 3k skill points) past lajatang min delay and it does practically nothing for your damage output. You could've gotten EV to 18 by putting those points to Dodging, for example.  The lajatang does better damage against all but undead and demons. The staff of earth starts to outperform both versus non-vulnerable monsters around Earth 20, Evoc 10. Training Earth raises its damage more than Evoc, although they both contribute.  Edit: The lajatang does better damage"
dcss,3dwtlk,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:31 2015 UTC,The +12 qstaff does better damage against all but undead and demons.   Did you mean the lajatang?

Gargoyle's have so high AC that you should go with 2-handed weapons for higher damage instead of using one-hander and a shield.

Sadly you got Snake/Shoals which are harder branches. Snake will be your first one to check out.   So i'd try out  Dungeon to D15 if you can -> Snake to Snake 4 -> Shoals to Shoals 4 -> Snake 5 -> Vaults to Vaults 4 -> Shoals 5.  TSO is more a late game god.

dcss,3dmljq,espais,3,Fri Jul 17 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"Relying too heavily on stealth + stabs usually backfires at some point, and maxing stealth at that point is excessive as those skill points could've helped more elsewhere. Especially with Dith, who doubles your stealth.  As you didn't post a morgue link it's hard to give specific advice, but generally I prefer training a heavier weapon to kill woken up and unconfusable enemies. Long Blades cross-trains with Short Blades, and the -2 aptitude doesn't prevent a spriggan to train a long sword/scimitar/demon blade to min delay (14 skill). Training a -2 aptitude skill to 14 is equal to training a +0 aptitude skill to bit over 16.  But training a heavier weapon isn't the only way to go. Spriggans have a superb aptitude with Evocations, and training it makes wands and rods do much better damage. One could also train slings or bows (both +2 apt) as an alternate way of dealing damage. Dith's Shadow Mimic boosts missile damage nicely, so it'd bit a bit of a waste not to train one. The choice between those may be influenced by what the dungeon provides.  Shadow Mimic also makes conjurations more powerful, so one could use those instead of missiles.  But of course Dith isn't the only way to go. I'm partial to Ashenzari with a SpEn. By the time one is doing the Lair branches, Ash's Detect Monsters passive ability makes it easy to avoid the hardest monsters, or find the optimal route to try to stab one, and his skill boosts make getting higher-level conjurations online a lot quicker. He also doesn't mind using fire like Dith does, which makes more branded weapons and ammo/wands/rods/evocables usable."

dcss,3dmljq,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"I have had some good luck with Dithmenos even in the late game.  With Dith keep in mind shadow form, duck in and grab what you want(items and runes) and then move out once you get down to the last few really hard enemies that are resistant to confuse and sleep spells.  Shadow form is also an excellent panic button to help escape with its damage reduction, resistances, and bleeding smoke.  The shadow mimic is also very useful for getting hexes to stick and with ranged attacks both of which are useful.  None of that deals with liches and the tougher dragons, so I always try to get iron shot. Comes in a few different spell books so by the late game it is likely enough to plan for.  3-5 shots usually deals with any lich or dragon that saw you coming.  Iron Shot is also quite so it doesn't draw in the whole map.  Stone arrow is also useful earlier on against things like demonic crawlers, and other earth spells like stone skin, petrify and Rapid deconstruction have some good uses so points in earth aren't wasted.  By late game I can do a fairly well between stabbing deaths aided by spells and iron shot/clouds of cold and other spells to kill with to good effect.  Shadow step tends to fall out of use late game as enemies keep coming larger groups.  Can be useful for a final approach to something dangerous if you can lure off the rest of the group but I found it to be an easy way to dive into more than I could easily handle too many times.  So quite doable with Dith, but definite advantages using Ash with scrying and skill bonuses remaining useful the whole game."

I'd felt like I was already training too many skills early on and was hesitant to add in Fighting/Long, but perhaps its worth it for late game as you mention.    If not, when do you recommend going after those skills?"
dcss,3dmljq,Slogo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Early game is the hardest part of the game, and stabbing works wonders in the early/midgame, especially when helped by the enchanter spells, so I would first play to the combo's strengths by training SB and stealth, and getting EH/Confuse/DSpray to low fail% as usual Then Fighting/Dodging to get HP and EV.  I'd start branching out to evoc, or LB, or conjurations, or bows or whatever before the first rune branches. Which one depends on the gear one finds. A nice artefact could be a deciding factor there, or an +Inv evocable that sort of pushes a SpEn to the Evoc route. Finding good spellbooks might be a reason to branch out to conjurations.  Because Ashenzari boosts one's skills, she makes it a lot quicker to branch out; that's one of the reasons I like Ash a lot. If you haven't tried a SpEn of Ash for a while, give her a try. She makes SpEn much more balanced than Dith, who I also like, but not so much with a stabber than with a hybrid conjurer or a ranged weapon user."
dcss,3dmljq,I_Probably_Think,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly you only situationally need long blades. A quick blade or rapier of electrocution can easily last all game so long as you have some other option for rElec and/or high AC targets.  In general I'd say once you max out EH's power, get a decent strength on dazzling spray, and min delay on daggers you should start branching into defensive skills and other aspects (which could include min delay on a rapier really). Usually that should be around the time you get to lair."
dcss,3dmljq,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Fri Jul 17 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"You could try branching out into other gods that help cover stabber weaknessess more. /u/ThreeInvisibleDucks mentioned some, but I'd also recommend Ru as a great choice.  Ru's passive at high piety will help a lot in combat by giving you partial stab opportunities and all three actives are effective at handling situations where stealth won't apply well.    Otherwise unless you get access to Invisibility (and even then) by the end of lair you'll need another good option for when you can't stab. The big thing would be to have good dodge/fighting by that point so you can take on most monsters in direct combat if you have to. That would greatly reduce your burden on stabbing for most encounters. After that you'd be looking for something heavy hitting to handle big burly monsters like a conjuration spell, evocations, or even something like a blowgun with paralyze needles or just good throwing in general."

The only times you want to move towards enemies are when its things like closing the last 1-2 space gap with a ranged monster or if it lets you block a hallway instead of fighting in the open.  Pop consumables early and as often as needed if you can't run away, same with piety abilities. Alright is going into emergency mode at 50% hp, good is like 75% hp, great is knowing its a panic situation before you even take any damage.

When you examine a weapon it will tell you what its base and min delay are. Your delay for every given weapon is your weapon skill divided by two subtracted from the base delay, no lower than the minimum. This means every even level of weapon skill provides a significant benefit, and makes for an appropriate 'stopping point' if you want to switch and level something else. Larger/stronger weapons will frequently have a larger base delay, but the same minimum, meaning they require more skill to use effectively. Reducing the delay to minimum is the single most significant benefit to damage.  And as a more general related tip.. understanding speed and how long actions take in general is difficult but important to playing well. Understand what things your character can do are quick, what things are slow, and choose from your options accordingly. It's easy to get in the habit of assuming 1 action = 1 turn because they all take the same amount of real-time, but that's not how it works."

dcss,3dl8zb,malboro_urchin,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Don't take the wiki too seriously. While a lot of the technical game information in there is just fine, the 'guides' range from OK to rather bad, with more in the bad category than OK... General advice there is OK, but it gets called the 'badwiki' on the official forums for a reason.  Some more specific tips for the characters you've tried: Trolls are very strong characters; Their claws are among the strongest weapons in the game at high levels of unarmed combat training. You DO need to be aware that their only defense, for quite a while, is their large HP pool: You'll destroy most enemies 1v1 but often can't afford to take on groups without healing up inbetween engagements. You will eventually want one of the heavier dragon armors as a troll.  Don't ignore the gods! They are INCREDIBLY powerful and very important to winning most of the time. Okawaru's abilities in particular suit a troll very well: His basic power gives you +5 to EVERY COMBAT SKILL. That is a massive boost to troll's already great unarmed damage (Unarmed combat uses your still directly for it's base damage. +5 damage for practically no cost!) and helps to bolster an early-game troll's meager defenses. Eventually Okawaru may also give you all the armour and javelins/giant rocks you'll need.  Other god choices for Tr: Trog is good for almost all characters. Lots of strong abilities, and gifts throwing ammo. Mahkleb does not boost your offense or defense directly, but gives you health when you kill things and lets you blast enemies with random elemental damage and summon demons to aid you in battle. Other gods can be just as good for Troll, but are a little less straightforward in play.  Troll general skill plan: At the start of the game, turn on fighting and Unarmed Combat. Once you feel like you can kill things quickly enough, turn off UC and turn on dodging. If you ever start feeling weak, switch back. Fighting should be on pretty much always. Mix in some armour training once you get a dragon armour.  Eventually start mixing in some Throwing to let you crushing things from afar with giant rocks (which you should pick up whenever you see them.)  Shield are OK as troll, but I do not usually mess with them unless they have REALLY good properties included.   Minotaurs are probably easier than trolls for a new player because they can wear body armour from the beginning, but they play essentially the same way: Train your weapon skill until you're comfortable with your firepower, then train defenses. Switch whenever one or the other feels lackluster.  Good luck!"

dcss,3djmbn,ZuG,8,Thu Jul 16 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"Obviously, with no mmap, you go wherever you get first. But all things being equal, I'd trade a decent labyrinth over the ice cave and volcano together; in my experience, labs just have more and better loot that is nearly always safely recoverable.   I'd also take ice cave over volcano, but mostly because you're playing 0.16; in 0.17, volcano loot tables got changed to offer some more rF armor options, which makes it more likely you'll find usable rF equipment."
dcss,3djmbn,archaeonaga,2,Thu Jul 16 22:25:48 2015 UTC,I have found game winning loot from labyrinth way more often than ice cave and volcano visits put together. Volcano loot has mostly been garbage or then I have just been unlucky. In average I think I've found better stuff from the Sewer than from Volcano.  Missing these portals is a good reason NOT TO PEEK some level from the stairs if your intention is not to clear it at one go.

Of ice caves and volcano, ice caves will has the better loot so you do that first to make sure you get something decent (volcano is usually just flame branded and fire protection egos)."

Plus last few ones I've been in have been that fortress layout which can take a while to run through, though I guess that's still shorter than caves."

dcss,3djmbn,Slogo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:21 2015 UTC,"Um, the one where it's the volcano with a small bridge that leads to a small fortress that spawns a bunch of reasonably hard things (Gargoyles, Ogre Mages, Hill Giants). Maybe it's just me, but that one can take a bit because the spawns are a little difficult. I guess that's not that different than the end of an Ice Caves though.  But yeah... I'm not sure for three portals I suppose. For two volcano first is a great idea, but if I could only do 2 of 3 then Volcano would be the one I want to skip, but if doing volcano first was the only way to actually do 2 I'd do it.

dcss,3di4in,angryformoretofu,2,Thu Jul 16 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"You should probably bail because you don't really have a lot of emergency outs if you have a hard level. Pushing your luck in Zigs is better suited to characters who have a lot of flexibility and options so they can blow a bunch of piety or evokables if the floor is tough. Your options is basically just to ""tab through with buff potions"" which could be really difficult if it's a floor where your demon whip doesn't work.  It's more concerning that you don't have rF++ or rF+++ than a lack of rMut.  Here's what I'd do...   Train only throwing. All your other skills are good enough to win Throw the best ammo you have at OOFs using penetration if you need to but silver/steel otherwise. Pop potion of might & haste too.   That's uh it really. You can pop OOFs pretty quickly with some strong throwing options especially with high str, might & slaying bonuses. The bigger danger is taking a bunch of damage to the face. You really are only concerned about getting the teleport malmutation or a crazy large # of malmutates that cripple your character. Both are unlikely if you're able to fight OOF's with your god power & potions and use good ammo to hit them hard as they approach.  The same strategy is important for liches and cursed toes when you encounter them in a locations where you can't lure them into melee range.  The other thing to know about malmutate is it is a line of sight spell. While you don't want to fight OOF + anything dangerous if you have something like a single dragon that you can put between you and the orb you can pelt it with penetration ammo without risking mutation.  Also use your enchant armor scrolls. You have 4 of them and a CPA that's only +3. Alternatively you could drop down to GDA if you don't have another source of rF+, but I think the CPA would be better. Just carry a ring with rF+ that you can swap in.  Lastly if you have a good eveningstar (or can enchant one up) I'd carry it around. You should have enough permafood that you can always swap back to the vamp demon whip (if you don't disregard this) so having something that hits hard with a good brand like freezing would help more against monsters that you can't drain life from (notably OOF).    Also it was probably a mistake to do Slimes with no rMut and no high damage ranged option. You need one or the other to prevent mutations from shining eyes. If you had avoided those mutations you could have saved 2 cure mutation potions which would have been more than enough to handle anything bad you pick up in zot.   50655 | D:13     | Lost mutation: You are dopey. (Int -2) [potion of cure mutation]   This was also a waste of cure mutation so you could have even had 3 (or cleared slimes and had 1 or 2)"
dcss,3di4in,Slogo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks.   I do have GDA for the rF++, or I could swap in a ring (or both).  I agree that I wasn't adequately prepared for the shining eyes in Slime."
dcss,3di4in,AngusOReily,3,Thu Jul 16 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"In going to agree with /u/Slogo for the most part. Get out of the Zig; the deeper you go, the more likely you are to hit a floor that you can't handle, and your escape options are limited. If you really feel like you want to explore for more gear, hell vaults are an option, though they're just about as risky. The only benefit to hell is escape is marginally easier if you play carefully. Pan is also an option, but the randomness means you might face dangers for which you are not prepared. Instead, you could take the time to suit your resistances to the branch at hand and proceed carefully.  Your defenses are pretty good, so it's an option if you want to consider end game branches.   That being said, if you think you want to push this character (up to you, but he could probably get a few more runes, or all with some luck gear and smart play) I'd go convert immediately to TSO. This is just a temporary swap to get to max piety. He can then bless your demon whip to turn it into a sacred scourge. This will be a big help with the demons and undead in the final branches. I have been in your situation before, but without clearing the Crypt. TSO piety is usually maxed in just two crypt floors; he loves killing undead/demons. You can then swap freely between TSO, Zin, and Eva. They are all ""good"" gods so you get no wrath for swapping. The benefit of swapping pre-crypt is that Oka (or whoever else's) wrath is more manageable there compared to in Tomb or Hell. That isn't to say you can't do it, just watch out.   If you swap to Zin, you essentially get max piety off the bat, since you can give him a bunch of your gold for it. Recite and sanctuary are both really strong options for end branches, though you might want to further train invocation.   However, if you just want to get the orb and peace out, I'd just try to be careful around OOFs, swap in rings when you need to and be really cautious Z5. The Zig will get you killed sooner or later, do I'd abandon that before things get too hairy.   Lastly, are you playing online? I'd be willing to jump in and watch your game if you're currently playing. It's easier to give advice in real time."
dcss,3di4in,Slogo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"That's all great advice, but honestly for a first win I'd just go for the win and not screw around.  The agony of losing a winning character is going to sting a lot more than the what-if of getting 15 runes.  Besides you can always just roll up another GrFi (or any Gr really), it's pretty rare for one that makes it to 3-runes to not be in a position to attempt the extended endgame."

Not sure where else I can get any more xp to get throwing up, so I'm planning on sleeping on it, and then going to Zot next."
dcss,3di4in,Slogo,2,Thu Jul 16 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"If you just want the orb, don't mess around in Hell or Tomb. Just full clear around in Zot and get some xp that way. When it comes to Z5, take your time and don't rush things. Pick off OOF and ancient liches. Don't tangle with big groups. Always have an escape plan. Most mutations are manageable as well. Teleportitis is bad for approaching the orb, but less challenging once you have it (unless you get particularly trolled). Berserk iris can also be a pain. Other than that, the wands use MP mutation can be an issue if you need to haste or heal and are drained. But if you lose a bit of int or AC? Not a huge deal since you're on your way out anyway."

dcss,3di4in,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:13 2015 UTC,If you have a ring that's good to swap to I'd just enchant the CPA and do that. You can always pop a potion of resistance for the last pip of rF+ if an OOF gets a good hit on you.  Or even just swap in 2 rings of rF++. You usually fight OOFs alone (run if that's not going to be the case and you can safely run). Your rings right now are pretty meh so it's not a big deal to swap them around. The MR+ ring is a good idea to keep around too though since it is relevant for things like liches.
dcss,3di4in,Slogo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"When I go for extended with an Oka worshipper, I always switch to Zin.  The wrath isn't something you can't deal with if you have blink (and preferably swiftness too) to get some separation from the pack that Oka will summon at the worst possible time.  Even if I have found a rMut amulet, by switching to Zin you can free up that amulet slot for something better.  And by this point in Extended I usually have my skills high enough that I don't need Oka's heroism bonus.  And Zin's reduction of the Hell effects is huge if you're planning on going that far.  If I'm not a Zin worshipper I now usually just skip Hell."
dcss,3di4in,AngusOReily,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:29 2015 UTC,I don't think the OP is shooting for extended though. It's the OP's first win attempt and they are asking about tackling Zot without rMutation.  For a non-extended game switching gods is probably going to cause more harm than good.

dcss,3dgsax,zaopd,3,Thu Jul 16 03:47:06 2015 UTC,"It's hard to miss any of the 4 unique runes in Pan as you'll both get a message when you enter a realm with one, and a confirmation message if you're about to leave a realm with an unpicked rune. You have neither a Regen+ amulet nor the spell at reasonable fail%. I'd train Charms+Necr next to get Regen castable. There's basically unlimited XP in the Pan and you're not lacking in any other skill. Then I'd train SW to low fail% to get additional killing power. You could peek in the first levels of the Zigs you encounter to search for Regen amulet, but if you get the spell castable, there's very little else you need. Meanwhile I'd switch to the rMut amulet and those 3 !CureMuts will probably be quite enough for the remainder of the game. With TSO you'll max out piety rapidly in the remaining branches. And haste up before boss fights, and don't hesitate to teleport away if you'll start running low in HP and come back again. I've had to reset some boss fights this way a number of times. I find the icy hell the hardest, and the fiery hell can be tough as well depending on the layout and a number of hellfire blasters.   With my first 15-runer I tended to clear almost every Pan level I entered. There's no harm in it if you find you can reliably kill everything, but once you're set for gear and skills, there's also little point in doing that, especially after finding the demonic rune--just take the first portal. And if you get the hellion island, just don't go there. There are less lethal places to get the demonic rune.  Edit: In my experience the toughness of the boss fights is highly random. Each of those can be hard if they keep spamming their worst spells, but sometimes they just try to melee and it's usually easy to overpower them. Sometimes just tele'ing away and coming back will completely change the difficulty due to aforementioned reasons."

Orc mines have a lot of mobs and the deeper orc levels have some tough things. It's probably on par with Lair for difficulty, but you don't have as much room to pick your fights so it's safer to do Lair first usually.  Do keep in mind Lair or Orc will be more difficult than you are used to as you are transitioning into sort of the next phase of the game.  Stay with throwing, don't use a bow. Well you can use a bow, but there's not much reason to. You'll do about the same damage throwing stuff. On a bow elemental brands are the weakest because they force your ammo to that type. Velocity/Penetration/Speed are good brands for bows and work better with various ammo types.  You can also stop training Invocations (you should be able to comfortably cast Oka's abilities) and evocations (focus on throwing and use that instead).  The mutations are from drinking a potion of mutation. But it's fine. You just swapped 2 str for 2 dex. The scroll one is annoying, but if you're proactive about getting out of trouble it shouldn't matter much."

Focus on just a few schools for specific spells now. The most notable problem is more the spread out elemental schools more so than the other parts. It's good to get spells online and it's not a big problem yet since they're minimal investments, but make sure from here on out you focus more instead of ending up with 5-6 spell schools at low levels. You were absolutely right to say get Mephtic Cloud going with Air magic, but now you've also gotten hexes in there which don't really lead anywhere that lines up with what Fire, Air, and Earth Magic are doing.  So I'd pick what schools you want to focus on, and you have quite a few options being a Sif worshipper. You want to get maybe 1-2 level 5/6 spells online then start working on your poor defenses. Your two routes, based on your available books would be to blast things with stone arrow/Bolt of Magma/Mephtic Cloud or to start being a stabby character with hexes/invis/mephtic cloud. The former of the two options probably being the one more suited to Sif and your current skills.  So for the former focus down your skills just to getting some offense spells online. In this case I'd say just Earth Magic and Conjurations which should be enough to get both the bolt and iron shot online at good power. Once you have those work on a little bit of dodging so you can use Sif's abilities then get your dodging and then fighting and melee skills. You can also go the necromancy route and completely stop training earth magic.  If you do decide to go all stabby then you'd want 8 short blades, 5-10 stealth, and focus all spell training on getting invisibility and metabolic Englaciation online, but that's going to be a harsher transition from your current build.  rPoison doesn't stack, one pip is as good as two.  If there's a hydra at lair go to orc/dungeon for a bit then come back to lair and it should have wandered off (if not blink and fight it using consumables and what not). I wouldn't dive down into orc yet though; just orc 1 or 2 for now.  Also don't train armor, you'll get almost nothing from it in leather armor.  EDIT: Also since you have a ring of invisibility train evocations to about 5 skill so that it is at about 50% success rate. Anytime you face anything that looks even remotely dangerous (even a pack of yaks) you can evoc invis to help with the fight or run away."

Or just tp away and get some more xp before you face it. The knife is cool but fighting as a DE is very risky, staff of earth is great for this time in the game.

If you're going for 15 runes then Necromutation would be helpful. Training Fighting helps because of dmg + HP.   I would wait until you find a nice weapon and enchant it/brand it. Short blades are only really good for stealth stabbing (exception being quickblade). Training a hybrid is always a good idea.  If the hydra got you down in L:1, then I recommend get more exp (or stock up on good wands) on Dungeon floors/Orc until you reach a dangerous foe. You can also teleport the hydra (wand of teleportation or teleport other) and find stairway to L2.  Not sure in 0.15, but in most cases rPois only stacks once.

In shoals you can use it to great effect for an escape or fight AND you have the rod of clouds so the evocation skill will be useful to deal damage.  Melee wise it depends. I'd probably go polearm or M&F. In the short term you can use a 1 handed one for a low skill investment, but later use a 2 handed one if you need to. Polearms would be a bit better because you can use reaching and your centaur speed.

Other than that train up dodging and armor. Heavy-ish armor is still fine (FDA may be a good choice). GDA is also fine if you want to pump your strength more, but you'd probably be better off investing in Dex and dodging."
dcss,3ddwcq,jpcrow,4,Wed Jul 15 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"The moment you get a ring of protection from fire or different dragon armor (like FDA) I'd ditch that hat, though maybe you would want to wear it in Spider Caves for the rCorr. -5 Dex is brutal with your poor defenses and you already have rPoison, but for now it's too risky to go around with rF- or without the Ice Dragon armor so that's fine.  Training: (You could probably get away with doing all these while still leaving UC training up, but you may want to stop it at some point to focus on defenses)   Step 1: Get Invocations up to the point where you can use finesse reliably (10%-15%ish fail rate at a minimum). The god abilities are going to be one of your best defenses by way of a proactive offensive boost. Step 2: Training Fighting & Armor up to 7-10 so your defenses are not incredibly bad (just normal troll bad) Step 3: Train Throwing to 10-15 for a ranged option (if 10 then 10 now, 15-20 later). Especially with Oka where he will gift you ammo to throw. Never move towards any creature that's going to move toward you and just throw things at them until they get to you (weakest ammo against weaker enemies, good ammo for tough fights). Step 4: More UC, Throwing, and Fighting/Armor/Dodging until you win or pick up a good rod and want evocations."
dcss,3ddwcq,Slogo,3,Wed Jul 15 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"rCorr desirable for Spider now? I only really desire it for Slime and Zot.  I know the mantra is train 'kill dudes' skills first as offense is the best defense but I think dodge shouldn't be overlooked. I'd say train UC, Fighting and Dodge right now. When you get the armor you want, turn your armor on and take off Dodge. And consider the shields option. You only need 15 skill for a large shield. You never know what you'll find and at that investment, it's definitely worthwhile to sacrifice the off hand punch for the added defense.  TrMo is a blast to play. I love hurling large rocks at sirens in Shoals. They have a wonky power curve where they feel weak in Lair but excel in later game."
dcss,3ddwcq,robbcorp26,2,Wed Jul 15 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Entropy Weavers can be pretty brutal, but I just realized they're still trunk only, so the rCorr advice can be disregarded unless the OP is on trunk.  Ice Dragon Armor is pretty weighty though so it's going to hamper the effects of training Dodge. For the low skill points (like armor 1-10) I think the overall defensive benefit is more on armor because you'll get AC and a little bit of dodging AND at low AC the benefit of another 2 points of AC is huge because of GDR. The 10 points in armor should give something like +4-5 AC and 1-2 points of EV which is a pretty good return. At the very least I'd get like 5 points in armor and then train dodging (the first 5 points would take almost no time, but give 1-2 extra AC).  Also getting a shield is very solid advice."
dcss,3ddwcq,Slogo,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"You take an rF- with ice dragon armor, however. Food for thought.  Also Entropy Weavers sounds awful. Just when I was beginning to enjoy Spider..."
dcss,3ddwcq,robbcorp26,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that helps get things straight in my head a bit. It is much more clear for me now.    Quick follow up question, where would you suggest I create my stash. I am at 52/52 slots full and need to put some stuff down, but would like to have one place I can come back to if I ever want any of it back... Lair 1 maybe?"
dcss,3ddwcq,Slogo,3,Wed Jul 15 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"I usually put a stash at Lair 1 because you tend to clear Lair 1-8, then Orc, then the Lair Branches and Lair 1 is a nice mid-point between those. After clearing the 2nd lair branch I try to pick up the items I'm most likely to still want (food, scrolls, and ammo usually) and carry them to another stash like the Depths Entrance (don't go back and forth to do this, I just take what I can and if I can't carry it all I just come back to lair later when I need that item).  I'm bad at stash management though so other may have a better idea, but my stashes always end up at the same places:   Lair 1 Vault Entrance (usually very small, and cleaned up once vault is cleared) Depths Entrance Zot Entrance"
dcss,3ddwcq,koboldenthusiasm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:17:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen discussions about whether or not stashes are necessary, what do you guys think? I've heard that just dropping stuff and control+F'ing for what you need is good enough. I thought they recently removed the monster behaviors that made particular stash locations desirable. (Like slimes don't dissolve things, monsters don't pick up and walk away with things, etc.)  I'm a relatively novice player (just one win under my belt) and I haven't made a stash for quite a while, haven't gone back. Am I missing out?"
dcss,3ddwcq,robbcorp26,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with either strategy, but having a stash at least keeps everything in one spot. Ctrl-Fing everywhere might be tedious and soak up perma food if you say some stuff very spread out."
dcss,3ddwcq,Slogo,2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"I think stashes still have their purpose. For example enchant armor scrolls, amnesia* scrolls, and enchant weapon scrolls are always useful but sometimes you don't have an immediate use for them. You can leave them where you find them, but you'll have to trek all over the place to get them when you do need them and you usually need all of them at once when you do need them. Otherwise you can just carry them and drop them off when passing by a place you'll visit again or someplace easy to get to.  But they are less important. If your inventory is full you can just drop whatever isn't actively contributing to your survival on the ground and pick it up later if you need it rather than going back to your stash. You can also make stashes anywhere that's useful now rather than having to put one in places where slimes won't get them.  So my general strategy is both... use my inventory space to make stashes as I go about, but if my inventory fills up it's fine to just litter things around and ctrl-f for them later.  edit... also permafood is a good example. You usually don't need to carry 100% of your permafood around, but if you leave it all spread out then going around picking it up would be self defeating for the case when you do end up needing it."
dcss,3ddwcq,ThreeInvisibleDucks,2,Wed Jul 15 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"They're not necessary, rather a convenience. I especially like to keep spellbooks in a central location so I can pick and choose by pressing 'M'. Later in the game I prefer a sort of hybrid approach; when I'm close to full inventory I drop excess stuff on downstairs in Vaults and Depths before I descend."
dcss,3ddwcq,ThreeInvisibleDucks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"I do exactly the same thing, except that I stash in Vestibule instead of Zot entrance. It's a minor benefit, but there's entrance to it in every Depths level."

dcss,3ddwcq,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:37:29 2015 UTC,Sounds good! That's a nice to have cloak pick-up. Eventually you may want to wear the hat again if you don't get another source of rF+ so holding onto it is a good idea. (and eventually the -5 Dex won't be as annoying since you'll have higher stats and better defenses). With low defenses sInv will be handy if you run into any unseen horrors as well so that's a nice side benefit.
dcss,3ddmcf,KravenLupei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:15:27 2015 UTC,"I'd max out Sandblast's/Stone Arrow's power, and pick up Petrify (and be able to cast it and LRD at good power). Which probably means you could turn off conjurations and focus on earth magic. The one caveat there is having decently high conjurations is good for Veh if you want to get an offered spell online quickly.  Otherwise cool it on the spell schools and get your fighting & dodging skills up. Turn off Evocations unless you want to wield the staff of fire as a weapon. Buckler is a good idea, but not quite yet. Train for it mid-lair, by that time you will get the needed 5 skill almost instantly.  You can also turn off spellcasting once you get a bit more mana (like 25 maybe?) unless you want to get bolt of fire online (which isn't a bad idea, but not the only way to go). Even then I'd only train spellcasting until the spell hunger loses another pip. In trunk you can't eat poisoned corpses so you don't want to be relying on bolt of fire with low spellcating in something like spider's nest. But 2 missing pips should be fine, especially with stone arrow to take out easy monsters.  Overall though don't take to advice too closely yet... the problem is you are still early on so it's hard to say what spells you'll get access to which will really change how you may want to play out the character."
dcss,3ddmcf,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'm training evocations to use the staff of fire I think, because I kinda wanna go fire bolt and some fire magic later,., but is the staff enough to justify doing that it should I stick with my dire flail until buckler and a 1h mace or whip you think?"
dcss,3ddmcf,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"If that's the case you probably want to train fire magic first and/or staves.  Staff of Fire won't do much without staves, fire magic, and evocations.  The evocation part of that formula will only help with you melee attack with the staff (and wands, but that's a minor benefit) so it gives you the least benefit up front. Fire Magic would let you cast Bolt of Fire while Staves (or M&F) will give you melee skills you could use. Staves and M&F cross train so you can really skill either one up and still have the option to switch to meleeing with the fire staff later on.  On Book of the Dragon, Bolt of Fire is the only spell you want. Summon Dragons maybe, I don't have experience with that spell, but training for it is a bad idea without some lower level summon spells to take advantage of it and even then training for a level 9 spell is a huge investment and you'd likely never get there.  I'm not great at caster focused characters, but if you want a versatile set of offensive spells the things you are looking for are usually: (Note these will overlap heavily and could be as little as 1-2 spells).   At least two types of damage (Fire and 'physical' being your likely choice since you have bolt of flame and earth spells) A bolt/high impact spell for tough single monsters An AoE spell to take out groups A spell that's hard to dodge/avoid for high EV enemies or times that you can't risk the tohit roll because of mana or other concerns (OOD, Fireball, Airstrike, cloud spells are all good fits here).   After that you're just looking for utility and escape spells really."
dcss,3dc5b1,zaopd,4,Wed Jul 15 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes.  Actual Answer: Dump all your enchant armour into a GDA. If you haven't found a CPA it's not worth waiting for one (sucks I know, but GDA isn't a bad second choice and you need heavy armour NOW). Switch to TSO, find a demon whip, get full piety by clearing vestibule of hell and wandering abyss, then bless the whip. Enchant it as far as you can. Sacred Scourge is the best 1h weapon for extended, but keep wyrmbane because it wrecks zot.  TRAIN DODGING!!! Get it to 20. Once that happens train shields to 25 and keep invocations on until 27, but don't focus it.   Avoid going for Pan runes and Zot 5 until you have rMut. around 15 invo TSO's holy warriors are really good because you can get seraphs. Only fight Hell bosses with a seraph because they are almost as badass as you are. Always have a plan to GTFO incase Okawaru wraths.  Good luck! Feel free to ask me questions!"
dcss,3dc5b1,Ijyb,3,Wed Jul 15 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, as it destroys your spellcasting ability and EV. Your AC is already good and you'd probably gain more from more EV. I'd enchant and wear something lighter, like a swamp dragon armour, or an artefact ring/scale mail with good enchantment. Sure, it's an excellent weapon, espcially when combined with Spectral Weapon. I'd clear Zot before Pan or Hells, maybe even down to Zot:5. But before that I'd clear the first few levels of the Zig in Depths to try to find rMut; 6-8 levels, or until you find one, whichever is earlier. Wherever you go, you're bound to pick up some mutations from now on. If you switch, I'd go for Makhleb or TSO mainly for their healing-for-kills passive abilities. I've never switched from Oka without Blink spell as Oka's wrath might leave you completely surrounded, but you have a bunch of blink scrolls to remedy that. Best place to switch would probably be Pan, as the durable summons get left behind when you port to another Pan level.   But first of all I'd train Spectral Weapon and Regen more reliably castable by training Charms+Hexes+Necr. SW is a superb buff with a good polearm like Wyrmbane, and if you switch from the Regen+ armour, you'll need the Regen spell. I tend to always cast Regen when I'm not at full HP regardless.  One of TSO's draws is getting a holy wrath weapon, but Wyrmbane is excellent as is and you don't necessarily need one, as a +9 trishula of holy wrath does quite similar damage. I've gone twice for a bardiche of holy wrath (+ Spectral Weapon), but it's two-handed and you've invested heavily to shields, so I wouldn't go that route here.  If I were you, I'd switch to Makhleb rather than TSO with this char if I were to do extended as he gives more HP for kills, although TSO has better summons.  And I've never done extended without rMut so I'd just probably take the win if I didn't find one in the Zig or in Zot:1-4 (or 5). Spamming Butterflies may help a bit to shield one from malmutate attacks though."
dcss,3dc5b1,ThreeInvisibleDucks,3,Wed Jul 15 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"He's a gargoyle his EV will always be bad from poor dex. GDA is good if you can enchant it up and will still allow for spells like haste with proper training. 45 AC isn't great for someone with only max 199hp. Doubly so because a lot of that AC I'd from wyrmbane and the ring which may be replaced at some point.  Max enchanted GDA on a gargoyle will give you enough AC to shrug off almost any melee attack outside of pan lords and some tier 1 demons.  I know it's decent to think 'decent AC means get EV' but I'm pretty sure AC works really well at 'the ends'. Meaning that when you have very low AC getting more AC is great, but at the same time when you can get very very high AC (like 70+) that also gives great return often times over significantly lower AC and more decent EV (or seems to at least). The problem is you aren't really talking about a 1 to 1 change. There's probably only going to be 10-15 EV that he can gain over what he'd get in GDA but the GDA is going to offer a lot of AC if he can max enchant it.  For example GDA base armor is 26 at max armor skill and +12 on top of that for +38 AC along with better GDR, FDA maxes at +25 AC. So already you are pitting +13AC & GDR vs whatever EV you can get in FDA over GDA. Blocking also factors in a bit (it reduces the importance of dodge, but with situational effectiveness). He could opt for lighter armor that's well enchanted, but the AC difference is still going to be quite notable."
dcss,3dc5b1,Slogo,2,Wed Jul 15 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"More AC would of course be great, but in the short term that means no SW and Regen as well, which was the main reason I wouldn't go for such heavy armour yet.  Edit: There's a lot of XP in all the upcoming branches, so getting those online and wearing GDA is quite feasible soon enough. I'd just start with SW and Regen"
dcss,3dc5b1,ThreeInvisibleDucks,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I think that's reasonable advice as well. I'm not sure which way is actually best, but both sound like a good plan."

The most important thing is that you're rC, rF, rN are all max-ed, as is MR and there's functional stealth. You'll do great if you can find rMut.

Not so much for burly melee dude, but there's a whole host of problem situations with them like a caster being instantly surrounded by dangerous monsters or a situation where monsters just repeatedly trip the traps creating a massive horde.  Though trunk in turn has some awesome additions and some cool new monsters.  Qazlal is good for anyone who can get high AC. So GrFi of Qazlal is great. You can also try a hybrid char and stand in your own clouds, but that's more gimmicky than practical. It's a lot of fun, but it is sort of more like the MiFi you already played (with invocations instead of throwing).  Dithmenos is good for just about anyone. Stabbers can use him to stab more, but will be weak to anything they can't stab, while big burly melee dudes can get shadow hits with big burly weapons for lots of damage (TrMoDith is quite fun with thrown large rocks).  Ru is good for anyone, but I don't like Ru so much on casters because I feel like the skills overlap a bit, drain is more significant, and the sacrifices can be trickier. Others do like Ru on casters though so it's personal preference. Ru makes a great stabber god in my opinion.  Gozag is weird, but probably more tuned for fighters/stabbers/hybrids who can take more advantage of the shops and gold distraction.

One way to do it is to retreat to the upstairs one step at a time, then stop once you're in a hallway. Sadly I don't know how to do this without implementing my own shortest path algorithm.

dcss,3d8c2x,Lawschoolishell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:16:03 2015 UTC,1) Use ID on potions  2) TRAIN DODGING!!!   3) Use enchant weapon on demon blade  4) Train demon blade to 1.0 mindelay (6 skill I believe)   5) branch out into area of effect damage (Iskenderuns mystic blast will loose punch at end of lair)   6) stay away from death yaks and orc knights/warlords.   7) stay away from uniques.   This should get you trough lair+orc.
dcss,3d8c2x,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:41:59 2015 UTC,"Agree with the advice, though you can always train staves & some evocations if you want to really focus on being a caster (you already have the stave of fire, but it's not a good melee weapon because you have no fire magic or evocations). Otherwise use your enchant weapon on the demon blade of freezing. It's a good enough weapon + brand to last until the end game, and the only other thing you're likely to want to use are artifacts and staves neither of which can be enchanted.  I'd pick up poisonous cloud probably, freezing cloud being an ok 2nd option too. It'll do you good through most of the game and as a Gr you can stand in the poison cloud and not be poisoned. It's sort of your choice on if you want to get the spell online through Poison, Ice, or Air magic (one of the three should suffice really). It also depends on the lair branches that spawn (which you don't know about yet unfortunately). Poison Cloud won't be all that helpful if you get Snake & Swamps, but it'll clear out Spider & Shoals quite easily.  Your spell selection is ok for now. You have a lot of early game spells, but that's to be expected for the early game. Once you get a cloud spell online I'd cool it on spellcasting skills until you have a min delay weapon, and 10 dodging & fighting. Fortunately as a Gr you don't need as many points in defensive skills as other casters since you have a naturally good AC.  Also personal choice but I'd get maybe 5 or so points in stealth. As a caster having a chance to pick your own fights is pretty handy. You're not looking to stab or sneak up on monsters, but being able to see something dangerous at the edge of your LoS and back-up without being chased is really handy."
dcss,3d6w75,miserium,2,Tue Jul 14 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"Aiite. Back at my PC. Just to elaborate a bit and looking at your character file a bit more:    One of the best parts about fireball is not just its high damage cap, it's that the spell is unavoidable. Loudness is a problem sometimes, especially on a floor with close together up-stairwells, but if the stairs are far enough apart I'd say go for spamming it as long as you have stairs to run back to in vision. When it's a good idea to be more quiet, Sticky Flames is your best friend.    I poo-poo'd the high fighting but with that amulet of rage it's not as bad as I thought. Still maybe a couple levels too much but your healthy HP is pretty good. I'd still consider dodging very important. You want it at or above 20 I think before you finish the main branch.    Of course my concerns with the cyclops' large rocks and similar threats stemmed somewhat from my experience being with a frailer race, but I do think you're just a tad too spread out skill-wise overall. I'd also consider your air and poison skills to be a waste. Conj should be enough for Meph Cloud especially since it's so cheap to cast, despite your bonus poison aptitudes.  edit I looked up Staff of Wizardry and it only raises spell success rate. It's not really worth much to you unless that's a problem with a spell you need desperately, but you could always use it just in case since switching weapons is a relatively fast equipment change"

The air/poison I had raised only until Meph Cloud was in the single digit failure rate, and with a +2 poison magic aptitude it didn't really take that long.

dcss,3d63yz,geedmat,3,Mon Jul 13 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"Short term if you want a little better Iron Shot you should be training Spellcasting (if having hunger/mana issues) and conjurations. Iron Shot is enough to take out any difficult monster you meet at this point so long as you can cast it several times at good power. Against packs you'll want fireball (see below) or something similar.  Other than that I think your main mid-term goals would be:   Get rF+ into your build. Right now you're on the hook for the +5 evasion ring to keep your defenses reasonable, so this may be tricky. Just something to keep in mind. Armor enchant your items if you have the scrolls. This is more important after the 2 lair runes then a right now thing. Branch into supportive spells like charms or tloc. Getting something like Haste online would be huge, but so would a cloud, smite, or un-evadable dmg spell. You could go for shatter, but that's a bit risky of a move as it is a huge investment and your int isn't particularly high outside of your +int ring. If you aren't going for shatter, you want to balance your Earth with conjurations as it's easier to level them both up than focusing on one. That way your Iron shot and/or LCS will be usable at a good power quicker. Work on Fighting for HP This can happen over the course of the rest of the game, but you are going to want at least 150+ as you near 3 runes.    21224 | IceCv    | Learned a level 5 spell: Fireball   You should learn this again if you can, not sure why you forgot it. It would fill that role of unavoidable dmg spell for when you meet high EV monsters (like Spriggans). You've already spent 8 levels in Fire Magic. If you can't cast it work on conjurations until you can as Conjurations will do double duty with improving your earth spells. Earth Magic AoE options are weakish and Meph Cloud won't be very effective for much longer, fireball would help when you need to hit a crowd.  Other than that keep an eye out for a demon whip and just keep being careful. Build wise you can keep branching into heavier spells or get yourself into heavier armor with a good melee weapon and just bash things while using iron shot.  Snake is going to be a bit dangerous without rMissile and your amount of firepower so just take it slow and take advantage of your ability to run away."
dcss,3d63yz,Slogo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I dropped Fireball to mess around with an earth school spell or two, habing used it a lot and wanting to experiment a bit. Outside of a few of them, the earth spells seem underwhelming. I'm glad you told me about Shatter, I'll avoid it for now. In general, I have a tendency to want to put my characters in a box, EE with strictly earth spells and FE with strictly fire spells.  I do have the Book of Clouds...should I look at picking up Poisonous Cloud or Ring of Flames? I assume Freezing Cloud is off the table due to fire/ice.  I have a Shield of Reflection. I know it's not exactly Rmsl but would it be better than the Artifact I'm using now? Dex +6 and Stlth+. I guess those stats aren't particularly helpful compared to a chance of avoiding missile damage."
dcss,3d63yz,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"Fire and Ice don't penalize each other anymore. At least not directly, the clouds can still interfere with some spells. You COULD skill up both, but you probably don't need to or want to.  Shield of Reflection only changes what happens when you block a projectile, it doesn't up the chance for that to happen. So stick with the shield with +6 Dex. It may not be as useful of a shield as something like rF+ rC+ but both modifiers are actually pretty helpful so it's a nice shield overall (stealth is nice to help you pick your fights).  Since you already have some poison magic poisonous cloud isn't a bad idea but you could also skip it. It's a pretty potent spell for a Gargoyle who's immune to the clouds. Ideally you'd get it castable mostly through training conjurations, but maybe that's being optimistic. You can also use it with ignite poison (if you have it) which you're in a good position to use since you already have transmutation online. At the same time fireball also covers the unavoidable big AoE damage if you got that again so you don't strictly need a cloud spell, though they are nice for dealing lots of damage for little mana.  You can pick up Ring of Flames instead if you feel like you'll be staying on rC++* for awhile and you have other fire and charm spells to grab anyways (otherwise the skill investment is a waste). Seeing as you don't seem to have access to charm spells and one of your ranks of rC+ is from a whip you'll replace eventually I don't know that you want Ring of Flames, but keep it in mind if you really lack rF+ as it can be useful for Zot against Orbs of Fire.  *Note even then rC+++ is better and adds a lot of utility to Ring of Flames because you can use it more safely vs ice creatures (like ice giants/dragons) that will take a lot of fire dmg and attack you with ice branded attacks. But at the same time you don't want to gear for rC+++ because it's not a particularly useful resistance most of the time."
dcss,3d63yz,cheeseburger_dot_mp3,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good character so far! Some thoughts on where I'd go from here:   Spell diversification. Sif should have helped you out here but I know the gods can be fickle. Do you have access to controlled blink, original flavor blink, haste, repel missiles, summon butterflies, regeneration, agony? Earth is cool and all but it's better to diversify a bit. Earth's not great against high-defense enemies and shatter is pretty underwhelming outside of niche uses related to its wall-destroying. I'd be happy to part with Leda's, Mephitic, Petrify, and even Lee's for Bolt of Magma and Fireball for the return in versatility. If Firestorm is known I'd even be inclined to switch my focus after shoring up defenses, but: Shore up defenses. +0 robe of magic resistance is bad. You are hovering around the rule-of-thumb 40 AC+EV recommended for a 3-rune game but a big portion of the AC is from being a gargoyle and is balanced by your having low HP.  An ancient lich can peg you for just shy of 150 damage with a crystal spear, and you have 110 hp! That robe has NO guaranteed damage reduction (pointlessly obscure but important mechanic) while a fire dragon armour you could easily sport with your 16 strength has 1/3 GDR. (edit: not nearly so big of a difference, not zero for the robe, see below or the wiki on gargoyles) You have no fire resistance which is gonna be a real problem come vaults, or sooner, so I'd look at skilling armour to wear FDA or some heavier artifact you've been neglecting ASAP.  Improve melee. I'm guessing this doesn't figure that much into your play right now but a whip is a bad base type and venom is a bad brand going forward. Look for demonwhips ~= eveningstars > morningstars."
dcss,3d63yz,Slogo,2,Tue Jul 14 00:56:32 2015 UTC,"The specific advice was very helpful, thank you. Unfortunately charms, hexes and tloc spells have mostly evaded me for now. I did come across Summon Butterflies, Agony and Necromutation though. What's the strategy with Summon Butterflies? Just use them to break line of sight and create distance between you and the enemy?  As for armour, the only thing I have immediately for fire resistance is chain mail. I'd need to skill armour to use it without much hidnerance with spellcasting, but I'll start doing that. I have a Swamp Dragon Hide I could enchant now, but I'm not sure it's worth wasting 1 of the 2 enchant armour scrolls I have.  I have a randart Morningstar laying around that has a flame brand and MP+9 I'll throw on."
dcss,3d63yz,cheeseburger_dot_mp3,2,Tue Jul 14 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't train all the way to chain mail, that's taking on a bit too much encumbrance.  A robe is ok, but something like a good leather armor would do as well. Then just keep an eye out for something like Quicksilver Dragon Armor or Fire Dragon Armor. I don't think you really want to train armor much, maybe just the easy to come by first 5-10 points.  The advice above is mistaken I think. Gargoyles always get GDR. Your robe is still offering GDR that's pretty respectable so it's not as much of a liability to be in a robe. What you wear for armor is pretty flexible so long as you can get a decent AC (I'd go for 40ish which isn't that much since you get 20 for free and have stoneskin)."
dcss,3d63yz,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, I'd forgotten about that. The actual GDR difference would be (edit)31%->46%. I still think it'd be worth training just to get a pip of fire protection, but it's not nearly as big a deal as I made it out to be."
dcss,3d63yz,cheeseburger_dot_mp3,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with getting a pip of rF+ and while you may be mistaken about the GDR gargoyles get a lot of strength so they're a good choice to wear something with a middling encumbrance anyways.  In terms of FDA though Gargoyles will get a bonus on that as well, so it's more than a 3% difference (wiki has it at 46% but may be wrong)."

dcss,3d63yz,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"You've got the right idea with summon butterflies. Apart from breaking LOS, it can also keep things from following you up the stairs or aid retreat through a narrow space. You can displace the butterflies with your movement but enemies have to lose a turn to melee them if they're in the way.  Agony is a good pick-up when you already have necro investment for regen, but I'm not sure if it's worth going down that path for you right now. Necromutation is an iffy prospect in general, and since gargoyles have some innate torment protection it sours the deal somewhat. It would take a lot of experience, you're probably not interested in much else in the transmutations school, and you'd have to be super careful about things casting dispel undead on you.  I think I misremembered that swamp dragon hide as fire dragon, sorry. Don't bother enchanting it, as it isn't great protection and poison resistance does nothing for you.

dcss,3cxtb0,tyndras,5,Sat Jul 11 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Looking good overall.  How I'd proceed from here to finish up the run: Shoals (bail on the rune floor if it gets too rough), Vaults 1-4, Depths, return to Vaults 5 for the rune, Zot, Win.  Optional steps would be Elf before or after Vaults 1-4 and Crypts after Vaults 1-4 (both risky, I might avoid them because you shouldn't have too much trouble with gear), Slime (can do instead of Vaults 5, more dangerous than V5 without rCorr and comparable with rCorr), Abyss (could do instead of Vaults 5 or Slime), not super dangerous with regeneration but really annoying.  Tactical advice: If you're not familiar with Patashu's Rule 0, it's very valuable advice for any character, but especially a melee one.  Paraphrased, it's that you should almost never move towards an enemy in line of sight.  This is one of the most important rules to follow in order to get better at DCSS, and I highly recommend trying to follow it whenever possible if you don't already.  There are a lot of reasons for this rule, but here are some big ones:   Generally, the area behind you is more likely to be safe than the area in front of you.  You've probably killed stuff behind you, but might be a bunch of enemies in front of you that you can't see.  So luring enemies into explored territory reduces the odds of getting caught by a lot of enemies at once. Having an axe makes getting caught by a lot of enemies not quite as bad as normal, but you should still avoid it whenever possible. Stepping away from enemies lets you lure them into advantageous terrain you've discovered.  Hallways are the obvious ones, but corners can also be useful, especially against ranged enemies.  If there're a ranged enemy near the edge of LOS, instead of letting it pelt you with shots while you walk toward it, you can walk around a corner to cut off LOS and force it to come to you.  This is really helpful against all the ranged enemies in Shoals and the Yaktaurs in Vaults and Depths.   Assorted strategic thoughts in no particular order:   The plate mail or the +7 chain mail are probably better than your current chain mail, unless you're in a branch that's very heavy on poison (you're done with snake) or cold (I'm assuming you're sticking with 3 runes and thus won't be doing Cocytus).  I'd use whichever of the chain or plate gives you the best total AC + EV.  None of those armours are amazing, if you don't find some crazy randart you'll probably eventually want to just pour a bunch of enchant armour scrolls into a plate with a good ego, some sort of heavy dragon armour (gold, storm, or shadow), or a crystal plate armour if you find one. ID that rod (wield it, worst case scenario it's cursed and you have plenty of remove curse scrolls), amulet (use an ID scroll, don't want to risk it being faith and having to lose a ton of piety if you want to switch back to vitality), potion (use an ID scroll) Stop training axes for now.  20 skill is enough for min delay, you'll be better served with more fighting and armour skill for defense, or evocation if you use wands or that rod a lot.  If you find an executioner's axe (Trog's likely to give you one eventually), you can turn axes back on to get it to min delay at 26 skill. Items you can drop somewhere to save inventory space: Potions of brilliance (useless if you're not casting spells), ring of intelligence (useless if you're not casting spells), amulet of gourmand (there is no reason you'd ever want to use this instead of the amulet of vitality unless you're doing something horribly, horribly wrong with your hunger management), the ring mail (I'm not sure if there's any situation where it would be better than the other armours), possibly the armour you're wearing now (snake is probably the only place in a 3 rune game where I'd consider using that over the others)."

dcss,3cvhv2,jestert79,3,Sat Jul 11 03:00:08 2015 UTC,"You get the bonus, but it's not worth the malus. Chei makes ponderousness slightly less painful in some cases, not beneficial. Black Knight's Barding or Hat of Pondering might be worth it, 3 or 4 extra AC are not. I recently won two UC trolls which found shields extremely valuable so I'm tempted to say yes, but you do have pretty solid defenses. I'd go shield if you've found one of resistance, not otherwise. One of Chei's greatest benefits is getting spells online cheaply due to high intelligence. Neither of those rods would nudge me to evo over magic skills."
dcss,3cvhv2,KingCholera,3,Sat Jul 11 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"A UC troll is different from a ghoul, because trolls have better damage but are lacking defense so trading your offhand punch will help shore up your weak defenses and your damage will still be crazy.  Trolls are also large, so the experience investment to use a good shield is relatively small.  A ghoul does less damage, has better defenses (especially as a Chei worshipper in very heavy armour), and takes as much experience to use a regular shield as a troll does to use a large one.  Also, he's using a longbow, which doesn't work with a shield."
dcss,3cvhv2,Quazifuji,3,Sat Jul 11 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks - just won w/ 15 runes.  Didn't need a shield, but I did learn some useful magic (Phase shift and Deflect Missiles)"
dcss,3cvhv2,conflare,3,Sat Jul 11 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"Some of Chei's powers are less interesting when you have good ranged attacks, but Slouch is a good way to whittle down a large number of enemies before finishing them off (if it takes one shot to kill instead of two, that's a big advantage). Step from time is great if you want to bring jerks into melee range.  I'm not sure if you get any bonuses for being ponderous with Chei, but it's certainly not going to hurt you, and AC is really, really important.  I honestly wouldn't bother with a shield in your current state. You want that longbow, and have good bows skill, a shield is just going to render that useless and you would need to put XP into shields. More of anything else is probably more useful."
dcss,3cvhv2,SvalbardCaretaker,6,Sat Jul 11 05:39:23 2015 UTC,There is a single relevant bonus to being ponderous: slouch does slightly more damage. But its not recommended to be ponderous for that.

dcss,3ctt08,zaopd,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'd use the CPA.  You're not casting enough spells for it to be worth wearing lighter armour.  You could always switch to something lighter later if you wanted to cast more spells.  Have you found a great mace anywhere?  You should aim to switch from the dire flail to a great mace if you can.  It's quite possible you've got one lying around already, if not you'll almost certainly find one in Vaults."
dcss,3ctt08,Quazifuji,2,Fri Jul 10 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"I second that use CPA.  You can get rMissile castable even in it, though you don't really need to. Just pump Int here on out. 31 Str is enough and dex has really poor returns on a Gr in heavy armor. Most of the time you're dodging an attack that would deal 0 damage anyways whereas having flexibility from spells will better reduce the # of attacks you take in the first place, including those that you won't/can't dodge even with an extra 5 or so EV. Plus eventually you'll probably be using an eveningstar and shield if you go extended so the  You can hit 70+ ac with the CPA and combine that with your torment resistances and rN+++ to clear extended so long as you max fighting and have a good ranged option like throwing.  Do you have enchant armor scrolls? Highly enchanted gold dragon armor would be the only contender to that CPA barring another CPA drop.  For comparison if you want this character tabbed through most of extended. http://pastebin.com/RcAdvmJa The only really scary fight was one vs a hellion + brimstone fiend where I had swapped out a ring for this:   Identified the ring ""Muepoima"" {rF+ rC+ Str-4 Int+3 Dex+6 SInv} (You found it on level 14 of a ziggurat)   and the reduced strength (the ring I swapped out had Str+4) nearly got me killed (though to be fair I wasn't expecting the fight to be interesting so I was just tabbing through)  Anyways the more important part of that dump if you want to compare is spell casting rates to give you an idea that you can still cast these charms spells in heavy armor it just takes a fair bit of investment in charms (but almost none in spellcasting!)"
dcss,3ctt08,Slogo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:08 2015 UTC,"I am wearing CPA and cleared Vaults 4 and Elf 3 (got a rod of inaccuracy in elf).  Will start upping Int and put some exp in charms.   Have to do Slime and Vaults 5, but will clear depths first.  What is typical extended order?"
dcss,3ctt08,genitaliban,3,Fri Jul 10 20:28:41 2015 UTC,I'd recommend  Dungeon Lair Orc L runes (2) Vaults:1-4 Elf Depths Crypt Vaults:5 (3) Abyss (4) Slime (5) Zig Hell Pan (10) Hell branches (14) Tomb (15)    for a fully extended game. You can Zigscum in Pan to make the H branches and Tomb easier.
dcss,3ctt08,genitaliban,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:59:17 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate on Zigscumming? I assume Pan has multiple entrances? How deep do you go with a melee dude? Tip/tricks?
dcss,3ctt08,Slogo,3,Sat Jul 11 01:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how many Pan entrances can spawn, but one is guaranteed in Depths. Whenever you enter, you get a completely random level or one of the lairs of the four unique Pan lords. Each of those levels contains portals to other Pan levels or may contain exits to the Depths, similar to the Abyss. Due to the random nature, you can visit an infinite number of levels, each of which has a small chance to contain a Ziggurat. You can then dive down those as far as you can tolerate, collecting all the loot and making future endeavors easier. It's a very tedious process, but you can build insanely strong characters this way. A GrFi of mine got close to 90 AC in the end including buffs, for example.  Tips / tricks - Pan isn't usually hard, but it can become so very quickly. For example, each level contains a pan lord that is randomly generated and may spam anything from Summon Butterflies to Firestorm. That means you need a very balanced character to survive. He is also usually accompanied by a large entourage of powerful creatures of all kinds, and the Demonspawn enemies you will commonly meet can pose quite a danger as well if they manage to exploit a weakness. So it's totally different from the rest of the game where you usually know what resistances etc. to stock up on. (The unique lairs are obviously an exception, they have a theme each.)  I'd also advise against using autoexplore - it may put you in the middle of serious danger if you're a bit unlucky, and the open layout of most levels compounds that effect.  And lastly, even if you're just going for the runes and not scumming, Pan is tedious and the usually low level of difficulty may let you grow complacent. Watch your step, don't let that happen."
dcss,3ctt08,Quazifuji,2,Sat Jul 11 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on your drops, race and god, but typically it's in tiers of:  Abyss & Slime  Pan & Hell  Tombs  For a gargoyle with low base HP I think Hell is typically going to be more dangerous than Pan (more smiting/hellfire in Hell). Abyss vs Slime depends on your access to rMut and rCorrosion respectively.  If you covert gods Tombs may be easier than Pan/Hell, but I wouldn't know I've never played a TSO/Zin extended game. Last time I did Tombs as a Gr fighter type I was worshipping Qazlal and used 7-8 Disaster Areas and a whole lot of upheavals to clear it."

dcss,3cqbg5,porp_crawl,3,Fri Jul 10 04:38:03 2015 UTC,Start as fire elementalist even when you want to be something else all other starting spellbooks suck ass. put everything off besides conjurations and fire magic till you can cast liquid fire reliable.When you have liquid fire just cast it on something and kite it
dcss,3cqbg5,uncledolanmegusta,2,Fri Jul 10 13:12:56 2015 UTC,"Basically this. Yaks, all undead, trolls, and orc warriors all walk into clouds of flame, so fill up a long corridor with Conjure Flame and sticky flame the closest one. Also once sticky is online train dodging, you don't NEED fireball until after lair.  edit: Also, if you're having trouble surviving play High Elf, not Deep Elf. All you're getting is a better earth magic aptitude for 2/3 the hp pool."
dcss,3cqbg5,ThreeInvisibleDucks,2,Fri Jul 10 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"The easiest background IMO is conjurer, which has a nice gradual increase in power just from the starting book. Beeline for Battlesphere, picking up all the easier spells on the way.  Beginning: Use Magic Dart liberally, and always heal up between fights. Searing Ray is great when fighting multiple monsters in corridors, and the last blast is a bolt that can damage multiple monsters at a time.  Dazzling Spray is the first AoE spell you get and its blinding effect helps to get stabs.  IMB has decent power against tougher monsters.  And when one gets the Battlesphere to sufficient power (I aim for 1% fail, which is something like 10/10 Conj/Charms esp with Vehumet) one should almost always cast it before fights, as it makes even Magic Dart powerful enough to kill the majority of enemies throughout the main dungeon and Lair.  After that, train up Fighting/Dodging and possibly a weapon skill if you find a decent weapon."

Rush your most powerful starting spell, ignore (well, dont invest heavily on) your defenses until it is online. They will be shitty even when trained, having that spell online as soon as possible will let you get away with them.  Avoid using noisy spells near unexplored areas.  Dont worry about eating permafood, later in the game you can develop ways to avoid chewing through it so fast (melee, staff of energy...) right now the priority is survival. Hunger is only problematic when you starve midfight, dont stay ""near starving"" if there might be an hydra round the corner, eat some pizza or fruit if no corpses show up.

Going any deeper than that it going anywhere else is more likely to get you killed or more mutated than it is to get you cure mutation or rMut.  But I'll also agree with the sentiment that doing Zot without any mutation defenses, while not ideal, is manageable.  Unless you're unlucky you shouldn't run into too many OoFs before Zot 5, and if possible you should avoid fighting any you do run into.  You'll probably rack up some mutations in Zot 5, but unless you're really unlucky you shouldn't get anything crippling enough to stop you from being able to do the orb run.

dcss,3cm9qo,DeadKateAlley,13,Thu Jul 9 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"Polearms is where its at, bro/sis.   Why is that, you ask. Let me tell you!    Lower skill requirements than axes. Good assortment and progression of two/onehanders (halberds/glaives/trident/demon trident).  Bardiches are exceedingly less rare than exec axes (thats if you are not worshipping oka/trog).  Demon tridents are the most common demon weapon due to shoals. Location location location! Reach allows you to stand in a 90° corridor and poke the guy that just came around the corner without being in sight of the entire corridor behind it. Say no to smiting orc priests! Reach:  Lategame the game escalates both your own damage as well as the opponents damages. You can kill an Ettin with 2-3 strikes wielding a Bardiche. So too it can kill you in 2-3 turns (if you get unlucky or play low AC/highEV.) So with reach you take down the time melee monsters are in your range, reducing damage taken and resting time. (increasing score, which is kinda irrelevant.) Think of it this way: do I want to have a free extra attack on every single monster I am going to fight? Yes please.  reach 2: blinking/batty enemies:  oh shucks that Elven Annihilator just blinked, now I have to move into melee range again, giving it time to Crystal Spear me! With reach, you go from 8 spaces in range to 8 (first ring)+14 (second ring), thus blinking enemies are a lot less annoying (boggarts, elves, killer clowns)  reach 3: summoners. A bit redundant with reach 2, since annoying blinkers are often summoners as well. Trying to hide behind summons? With axes you have to kill the summons or grab a ranged attack, which is weaker than your melee killdudes (since if you had strong ranged, why would you use melee?). With reach, you can poke them 'till they pop.  Granted, you miss 50% of the time; but if you have strong melee, thats probably still better than your ranged attack.  (plus if you dont reach far enough, you will still hit the thing in the first space).  reach 4: summons. Shit has hit the fan, you are nearly dead but fear not! You have summoned allies to take the heat and turn the tide of the battle. With polearms you can let the ablative meatshield tank damage and still contribute to the fight.  The antithesis to axes, it teaches the value of positioning, where axes teach the lesson that positiong does not matter. And on a strong axe user thats true 95% of the time; the other 5% you are fucked."
dcss,3cm9qo,SvalbardCaretaker,6,Thu Jul 9 01:36:44 2015 UTC,"A couple more/expanded perks of polearms:   You can use reach to hit a dangerous enemy while keeping an nonthreatening one between you (similar to what you can do with portal projectile). Especially good against distortion users. Polearm reaching goes really well with spectral weapon, which is a major boost to your offense if you can use it. It can stay behind you in safety and reach to hit your enemies. Merfolk have a crazy +4 apt to polearms, and are strong in general. Reaching is super useful when enemies are wandering around confused (combines well with Fedhas mushroomdudes). Axes don't really have good 1h options, so you are generally committing to 2h when you choose them. Polearms have demon tridents (1H) , glaives and bardiches (2H) to choose from as solid endgame weapons. Reach kiting if you are faster than the enemy."

dcss,3cm9qo,Xelif,5,Fri Jul 10 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Long blades, maces and polearms offer attractive one-handed options (double sword/demon blade, demon whip, demon trident). This makes weapon + shield a possible combo, making them more suitable for hybrids who won't be training their weapon skill to 27 and for squishy races that need the extra defenses.  Polearms obviously have reaching, which makes them quite well suited for hybrid melee play-styles (summons, necromancers, warpers), as well as fast species who want to kite safely (spriggans, centaurs).  Long blades offer the highest melee damage in the game (except giant clubs or high level unarmed in forms). Even with axes, you should always seek to fight dangerous foes one-on-one. Long blades will do more damage in one-on-one fights, making the dangerous foes die more quickly.  Basically, the big disadvantage of axes is that, because broad axes suck, going axes implies that you will eventually wield an executioner's axe, and that requires finding one (not guaranteed!), training Axes to 26, and foregoing shields. No shield means you'll have to wear the heaviest armor you can find. Axes to 26 + super-heavy armor = no access to support spells for the vast majority of a three-rune game, and limited skilling in a ranged skill, Evocations, and Invocations. You're essentially required to solve every problem with your axe and consumables. Not every problem in DCSS is best solved with an axe.  Some of those support spells you're giving up are quite powerful. A character wielding an eveningstar with a buckler and casting Haste will significantly outclass you in most situations. Deflect Missiles is always useful. Regeneration is always useful. The defensive buffs (Ozo's Armour/Stoneskin/Phase Shift/Cig's Embrace) can make up for the lack of heavy armor."

A lajatang is the least skill investment you will require for an end-game worthy weapon, which makes it a nice choice for hybrids or spellcasters looking to expand into melee territory. Polearms are nice when you can hide behind summons.   If you're playing optimally 1v1, then a sword/mace will give you the most damage to kill that 1v1 dude. Great swords are also really nice weapons that don't require a huge skill investment (only 18) and frequently spawn with good brands (via wights).

dcss,3clcav,espais,4,Wed Jul 8 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"Out of all the combos I've tried so far, I've had the easiest time with SpEn. I like to first train both Spellcasting & Hexes, and later a little bit of Ice Magic, to up the spellpower of Ensorcelled Hibernation and eliminate its spell hunger. I think I usually get Hexes up to 5 or so, and Ice Magic up to about 3.   Once I've got EH and Confuse memorized, I'll split experience between Short Blades, Stealth, & Dodging (weighted towards SB due to a ridiculous Stealth aptitude) until I have each at about 10. I don't start training Fighting until I'm in or around Lair, as Spriggans have a low aptitude, and the hp benefit from fighting scales with character level.  Beyond that, it depends on what I've found. In my last run (which ended thanks to an unlucky blow from a hill-giant), I found a Book of Frost, so I started skilling Ice Magic more heavily to take advantage of Ozocubu's Armor, and eventually felt that diversifying my capabilities with Summon Ice Beast was a good idea, so I memorized that and started skilling Summoning as well.  I tend to put all my stat points into Int, because more Int = less spell hunger mp = more EH casts , handy as it often takes quite a few EH casts to sleep an enemy, even one with a listed 60% success chance. However, I wouldn't know whether or not that's the optimal stat spread."

Take advantage of god abilities for enemies like that. For a stabber, your ideal god should either:  1) Give you a means to kill those enemies, or  2) give you a means to escape from those enemies.  I ran away from a good amount of death yaks. Elephants were slightly more manageable once I managed to take down one. Mind you, in these scenarios (across 2 stabbers), I was either worshipping Kiku or had found Animate Dead and trained Necromancy and/or splashed a bit of Summoning for Shadow Creatures.  Anything that gives a stabber allies/meatshields is fantastic, so Fedhas, Kiku, Yred, and to a lesser extent, Makhleb, are all great picks for a 3-rune run. I think Makhleb doesn't quite give you the hordes that the other 2 would get you, and, having never made it into Vaults, I obviously can't speak for extended."
dcss,3clcav,amalloy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"I would also suggest Gozag as a uniquely powerful god for SpEn. His gold distracts enemies for possible stabs, you never use the corpses for food anyway, and the massive amount of money you get from him allows you to buy all the best stuff in shops you come across, ensures you have tons of potions/scrolls/evocables to get you out of tough spots.   He makes Evocations uniquely powerful. You can sponsor evocable shops with his god power to ensure you never run out of wands and exp evocables and scrolls of recharging and crap like that, and then gain distance and then use area wands (bolts, fireballs) to blow the crap out of groups of tough to kill mobs.  Don't try to melee tank them, though, always get distance on death yaks and dire elephants in particular. They're super dangerous.  Invis also makes a lot of these elephant/yak fights trivial, so if you come across evocable invis, you're gravy (especially with gozag, since you can run back to a shop and buy it with the massive amounts of money he gives you)."

dcss,3ckgi5,onmach,8,Wed Jul 8 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"My strategy with fighters and blasters:   Be buff (bare minimum: >150HP, >20AC, rF+(+) and as many others as possible of course) Cast, quaff, read, evoke everything that may help Go down, immediately read a scroll of noise followed by a scroll of immolation Take out two or three guards to fill the screen with chunks Keep alternating between fighting, buffing and immolation   Most of the things that follow the first wave will happily walk into the flame clouds, which means you can often sustain an indefinite chain reaction where enemies kill each other. (Lots of giants etc. that explode in 5x5 fields.) This means you can often take out half the level before having to retreat. Biggest danger are wardens, you need to have a powerful ranged option, which is the biggest drawback of this strategy. (Besides waking up the other half of the level, but you can usually pick those off one by one later and without consumables.)  I usually do V after D, L, O, L runes and maybe E and / or U. (In that order.)  Edit: I have to say, though, that I play V:5 more like chess than this action-packed strategy sounds, i. e. it's not rare to think about a move for ten minutes or to save, think and come back later."

dcss,3ckgi5,robbcorp26,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"It's not too difficult to pull off - I've won two out of two with it - but  it definitely helps to do V:5 as the last possible thing before Zot (in a three-runer, at least), and to have as many pips of rF+ as you can. If you don't have rF+, the malevolence of Xom will make sure you get caught in the flames and die. You definitely want to be hasted and buffed before you go down the stairs, but forgetting isn't necessarily a death sentence if you're careful. Scroll of noise on round one is strictly optional but it does draw in more fuel for the first scroll.  To start the party, Wands of Fire, Cold and Fireball make good hilarity primers because you can set off multiple explosions with them each turn. Ditto any other line or AoE effect. Go for the largest number of monsters you are sure you can kill in one hit. If you can swing it, my personal favorite firestarter is a rod of ignition. Try to do as much damage with your immolation scrolls as you can without getting hurt too bad. Defense is always the main concern, but getting the chain reaction of death to reach critical mass is second. Try not to do anything that puts you in immediate danger, while killing as many immolated things as you can each turn to feed the flames. Don't forget to bring something that can kill all the jerks who resist fire.  A scroll of blinking is a decent way to bail on the center in an emergency where a warden blocks the stairs and you can't make him die. You'd think teleporting would be more dangerous than it actually is. With the amount of noise you are going to make in the first round of explosions, nearly everything on the level will be closing in on the stairs. Pretty much any other destination will have fewer jerks around and clearer escape routes."

If you avoid making a ton of noise on the stairs with ?immolation, most of the level will still be asleep, and you can take stuff out in small chunks however your character usually kills dudes. The stairs is the worst place to be, because you will make noise that drags dudes from all four chambers right on top of you.  That said, I usually don't do vaults:5 for my 3-rune games. Slime is just a lot more predictable, with a small number of well-defined threats and only one serious fight, on which you can spend all your consumable buffs in comfort.

I'm not worried about the noise, as one can always walk/blink/teleport away.  With my GhMo^Mak winner I basically just hasted and stepped down, reading immolation and started punching people. Makhleb keeps you near full HP anyway.  My first time of blasting through was with a DECj^Veh with Fire Storm. Hasted, buffed up, descended, read immolation, cast Fire Storm, blinked south, cast another Fire Storm and the welcoming party was gone and I was at full HP and MP. Fun times. But Fire Storm is sort of a special case anyway.  But if the character isn't suitable for blasting through, my preferred option is to jump down a trapdoor, after buffing up of course. Then I keep on teleporting until I land to as non-crowded position I can find and just proceed from there.  With good enough defenses, meaning you can afford to be surrounded, I've also stairdanced succesfully a number of times. If the stairs get sealed, time to blink and tele away, but one can often stairdance at least a couple of times.  And as many other posters said, I tend to postpone V:5 until after I've got both Lair runes and cleared Depths and Crypt. Sometimes I even get the abyssal rune before it, usually depending on availability of rMut and reliable teleportation.  One of the reasons to postpone it is to stock up in healing items, as you might have to stay for a while and the monster density is so high."

Vault 5 is setup to just pile on the pain with you constantly being surrounded.  Other advice is if you do want to stair dance you want to dance early and often since you can't always go back up. So Just basically anytime you have 3+ mobs adjacent you head up the stairs to take them out. On top of that you have to have a plan for when something shows up, so either good ranged options for a warden, something like Slouch/Step from Time, or another power packed thing to use.  But yeah... Teleporting is a powerful option and one you want to exercise early if things look too dangerous.  In a 3 rune game I'd only go vault if I was heavily armored & melee focused but with some good ranged god powers or options. For a lot of builds abyssal rune is going to be easier."
dcss,3ckgi5,cerealjynx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:05:49 2015 UTC,use magic mapping scroll then use control teleport and port in one of the corners then you just wait till the enemies come when you done with 1 corner go to the next vaults 5 is actually pretty stupid

dcss,3ckgi5,porp_crawl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:36:28 2015 UTC,I just always skip v:5 and do slime instead (or sometimes abyss). Its so much easier and often has better loot too. V:5 will give you more XP though.
dcss,3ckgi5,DeadKateAlley,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"Another gimicky trick is if you have Stasis effect (or lots of Cure) and Alastair's Intoxication at a decent power, you can turn that ring of mobs into a three stooges set piece. This usually gives you a little bit more room and time to maximize AoE targets.  If you have decent stealth, teleport or blinking is pretty safe. I usually try to clear out the outer perimeter of one of the quadrants first (some place to retreat to), then carefully take that quadrant. You'll eventually clear out the welcome party and when you do, you have a pretty safe retreat.  If you're not super familiar with V:5, it's definitely worth a Magic Mapping."
dcss,3ckgi5,dbbbbbb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:12:35 2015 UTC,I generally teleport and try my luck elsewhere. Usually the worst part of the floor is the entrance area. Once I have a char at V:5 strength I usually have little to worry about but hubris (which will fuck your shit up in the hells).

dcss,3cgwua,ThreeInvisibleDucks,2,Tue Jul 7 20:39:24 2015 UTC,Congrats! I only recently got my first win after years of on and off playing (MiBE) and now I'm branching into spellcasting classes. Somehow I always glossed over Sk. Reading about them on the wiki makes them sound pretty interesting.
dcss,3cgwua,couchreader,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:39 2015 UTC,"They can be difficult to get off the ground, but if you play cautiously in the early game and get one going they serve as a nice way to branch into spellcasting focused characters. You can play it like the character here or you can play it with a more spell casting focus where you take your weapon @ min delay and charms skill and support that with other spell schools.  Here's a skald I recently played for example: http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rawdata/Slogo/morgue-Slogo-20150706-041427.txt (though that was a very atypical game with very odd drops so I wouldn't necessarily consider it a model play through).  My start was weird, I got a very early +Inv item so I trained evocations before bringing any skald spells online besides Shroud and Infusion. But from there it got more normal: min delay on weapon, charms so I can cast Spectral Weapon, then some defenses online and then I branched into Venom Magic (Mephetic Cloud and Sting) and from there developed my mage side while also working on dodge & fighting."
dcss,3cgwua,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a squishy start compared to a fighter or a berserker. I usually either start skilling a skald like a fighter (train Fighting+main weapon skill), or I directly start skilling for Spectral Weapon and use Infusion in almost any fight before SW is online. With this one, I chose the latter.  But after SW is online, the damage output jumps up dramatically."
dcss,3cgwua,netghost,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:13:19 2015 UTC,So I just was playing a Merfolk Skald to some minor success (well I died less bad than usual).  Do you find that Shroud does much of anything?  A Spectral Polearm works pretty well :)
dcss,3ci3xu,smips,5,Wed Jul 8 02:12:59 2015 UTC,"Stop training M&F. 18 is more than enough (Eveningstar hits mindelay at 16).  Your armor should be higher than your dodging. You have better apts for it and your EV is going to be somewhat bad anyways because you are in plate. Training armor does help Dodging (a bit), so it's more worthwhile with the better apt and the good returns because you are in heavy armor.  Now that your base stuff is set, Train throwing; you worship Trog so you will get ammo and you'll need it to take out threats from a distance. 12ish throwing is enough to last you until Zot (at which point you may want 15+).  If you are going for 3 runes, 6 int isn't that big of a deal, but you may want to go up to 7 or 8 int as you hit the upper teens/low 20s just to be safe.  Optional: Use your brand weapon scrolls to reroll the demon whip brand. Flaming isn't the ideal brand for the weapon, but electric would be incredibly helpful. Since you worship Trog even if you end up with something sort of crappy you'll eventually get some randarts that will be useful anyways (or an anti-magic brand).  If you are taking a lot of damage you can burn your enchant armor scrolls on the auxiliary armor. You're in a position though where you may be looking for some Dragon Armor so the scrolls would be useful there, but that's reliant on you actually getting there so use the scrolls if you need to (it sounds like you do since you used your blinking scrolls). There's always a fair chance you will have the plain boots/hat/cloak until the end of the game and almost equal chance to find a randart auxiliary item as an ego one.  You aren't using Brother's In Arms. Try to use that in dangerous situations before you resort to blink scrolls, teleport, or healing potions (use BiA earlier than you would those options). Piety comes back, consumables don't.  Ctrl-F plate armor make sure you didn't miss any enchanted plate armor in Orc."
dcss,3ci3xu,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"Extremely torough advice. But: I am pretty sure no weapon in the game has odd skill for mindelay. Eveningstar is probably 16, not 15."
dcss,3ci3xu,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"Fixed! Possibly a typo, possibly just my mistake. Either way thanks for spotting it."
dcss,3ci3xu,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! A few questions:  Is it normal to always stop training your weapon skill after hitting min delay? I always thought it was a skill you'd want to max to increase your damage output.  I think my trouble in Orc was before I found better armor and maybe before the Demon whip too. Once I was better geared I had no issues, so I'll probably hang on to the enchant armor scrolls. But that also explains my lack of Brothers in Arms use. Normally I abuse it very readily, though it never crossed my mind in that particular situation.  Is this a good time to start training Throwing? I think one issue I have is knowing when to start diversifying skills."
dcss,3ci3xu,Slogo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:17:24 2015 UTC,"You eventually may go back and max out the weapon skill, but up front it isn't worth it.  With min delay and a decent weapon + brand most enemies will die pretty quickly to your attacks. At that point the bigger threat is a lack of flexibility in being able to deal with challenges or tough situations. A little extra melee damage will solve or prevent very little of those situations, but having breadth for your character (and higher defensive stats) will.  It also ties into your last question. When you hit min delay on your weapon that's a good time to start diversifying. The first thing you generally need is dodging, armor (maybe), and fighting, but as you start getting those to reasonable numbers you have the chance to diversify. One small exception is you may try to grab 7 in throwing earl-ish on so you can throw decently + get ammo gifts."
dcss,3ci3xu,urchigold,2,Wed Jul 8 13:24:16 2015 UTC,"For Spider: find a blowgun and a bunch of needles before you go in. Most enemies are susceptible to poison and die pretty quickly, especially orb weavers, who can be a pain in the ass (they avoid you while tossing orbs of destruction)."

Throwing would give you excellent ranged offence due to large rocks and your large amount of str. If you go that route, start collecting tomahawks and javelins as well, limit large rocks to dangerous targets. Hydras for instance tho very damaging have very poor defence. With about 10 throwing you can kill one with 6-7 tomahawks. Always engage from maximum range if possible.  I wouldn't go for more offensive spells with a troll, even with chei. Instead shoot for good utility and defence stuff."

You want to pump dodge and fighting (especially fighting) for statue form to make your defenses super solid. There's not much EV penalty to armor form so as a Chei worshipper you can easily pull off 35+ EV in statue form.  Any points you'd spend in armor would be better off training for spells, throwing, or both.  Both gloves are largely pointless because of statue form. I'd wear fencer's gloves because the Dex will boost your stealth while you move around outside of statue form. Later on you'll probably want the Hoduy gloves if you go extended and start using other forms or wearing armor (though you don't need to).  Stealth is still pretty good for statue form, especially as Chei, because seeing battles before you are a part of them is really handy when you can't run away easily. Envokable Invis, if you use it early in tough fights, is often a useful way to mitigate the danger of the fight (though be warned you'll have trouble chasing around targets that can't see invis)."

Also, the shadows can hold up enemies while you make a break for it. Only if you have a decent chunk of mp left though. Also the LOS reduction makes it harder for centaurs, yaktaurs and the like to fire upon you while you run.   The line of sight reduction might be helpful to avoid being smited/tormented/hellfired in the lategame, I dunno. I haven't tried it much there.  Personally, my problem isn't that the lantern is a bad item. It's just that I always forget to use it during those niche situations where it'd be really helpful.

Evo: only train evo if you have something to evoke, does not look like it.   Shoals:5 has awesome loot, and the worst part is the rune vault, all the other little rooms are a lot easier. Only the unique Ilsuiw can make trouble, but she does not see invisible.   Then Snake is a good idea, in vaults you have to be extremly careful due to low MR - you will get Marked a lot , maybe switch to another double blade you have.

Focus on fighting/dodging/armor and get your defenses up a bit. Also get a little more throwing at least (15 maybe) after some better defenses.  I'd try and ditch the amulet of faith when you can. You have good items already so the piety hit for taking off the amulet shouldn't affect you too much.  Snake should be fine so long as you try and clear near the stairs and retreat if you get overwhelmed. Remember you are faster than everything in snake!  You pretty much have everything you need to clear the game so long as you take things slowly and carefully. Your only big risks are banishment (but you have statis amulet), corrosion (which you also have amulet for), and general being overwhelmed.  Once you get armor and dodging to the point where you have 37+ AC and 18-20 Dodging you can start thinking about investing in Charms for rMissile, Regen, and eventually Haste. I wouldn't worry about tLoc unless/until you have portal projectile or something more interesting than apport.    Also you cleared Shoals but aren't carrying around a buttload of javelins. The tomahawks are good, but you should also have some javelins for tougher monsters.  If you can get 20 Throwing by Zot (easily doable) on top of 20+ fighting/armor/dodging and some charms you should have a really good kit for there. Save some steel ammo for OOFs/Ancient Liches.

Then you cured those off AGAIN to get rid of a meaningless -2 Int bad mutation.  MP wands and easier spells are pretty great mutations for a minotaur where the only spells you'll cast are charms that have nearly the same effect regardless of power level.  Anyways if you want to play the mutation game don't chug cure mutation potions except to get rid of mutations that will kill your character before you get a chance to eat more mutagenic meat/potions OR if you want to cure mutation to get rid of a bunch of bad mutations and are done playing the mutation game regardless of what good ones get cleared.  In your case with clarity, horns 2, +2 STR and +20% HP I would stop mutating and settle for what you have. The +20%HP on top of being a minotaur is already a great boon.

I cannot put enough exclamation points on that remark: Heroism is the best thing there is in the early/mid game, and Finesse doubles your damage output. If you took Okawaru just for the armour gifts, you are sorely underutilizing your god.  I agree that your sword+shield are easily good enough to stay 1-handed. Skill-wise, you need to concentrate on just a few skills at once: putting 10% of your skill points into something has very little impact. You already have plenty of Lbl training, so turn that off for a long time - probably for the rest of the game Fighting/Dodging/Evo/whatever will be better. And 15 is plenty of Shields as well, for a regular-size shield. As I recall Okawaru wants Invocations at around 11 or 12 to get good use out of his abilities, so I would focus that for a little while and use his abilities. I guess my general recommendation skill-wise would be to never give any skill less than 25% of your attention: this isn't perfect, but it is much better than giving everything 10%. So, perhaps 50% Invo, 25% Armour/Dodging for a while, and then when you turn off Invo you can turn on Fighting and/or Throwing.

dcss,3bv1ab,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Thu Jul 2 12:18:46 2015 UTC,Thats how I start a TrMo: 100% into UC until 8.5 then branch into other skills depending of if I found good armor or a shield.
dcss,3bv1ab,cheeseburger_dot_mp3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:21:02 2015 UTC,"UC gets a tick faster every 5.4 skill levels, so those multiples make the best breakpoints."
dcss,3bv1ab,pereza0,2,Sat Jul 4 05:53:32 2015 UTC,Dont train spellcasting at all early on. Food is not a problem since you can stay engorged. For spells train EE exclusively.  I would probably pick either melee or magic early on (maybe based on god choice) but focusing on both might be hard. You can always kill trash in melee though
dcss,3bv1ab,pereza0,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:25:49 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a common thread: Don't train spellcasting.  Holy smokes because the aptitude was at -5 I thought I had to get that raised ASAP, but everyone is saying not too. This is great!

dcss,3bv1ab,Slogo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, spell casting is mostly for overall spell levels, MP, spell hunger and to a lesser extent spell success  and power(?)  Training a specific spell school is the best way to get spell success and power, which are usually a bigger priority.  With Troll's apt you will get a lot less out of it. Don't train it until your main skills are at a mich higher level"

Late game training a -2, -3 or -4 to 10-15 isn't hard because of how much xp you get each kill, but early on you will be sinking points for no return when your character is the most vulnerable."
dcss,3bv1ab,urchigold,2,Thu Jul 2 14:05:16 2015 UTC,The standard and most reliable way to play a troll is the same across all backgrounds: train UC and pretend you are playing a monk. Picking up useful low level spells like repel missiles and blink sometime during the game is also good.
dcss,3bv1ab,urchigold,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:49:50 2015 UTC,"Never played this build significantly, but I'll chime in.   I'd say do UC up to 5 or so. Troll claws wreck most stuff in the early game.   Then start training Earth just to pump up Stoneskin as your initial defense. Keep using claws and training UC primarily. Add dodging to the mix as well.   After that I dunno. Spell hunger is less an issue since trolls can eat almost anything at any time."

Enchanting your boots, hat, and cloak, could give you an easy +5 AC and for someone like a DD where taking 1 damage and taking 0 damage are very different that AC would be pretty useful.  Training spellcasting doesn't help (or won't for a while) because you've trained invocations and evocations and MP is derived from whichever skill would give you the bigger MP pool. At equal training that's spellcasting, but in your case it's invocations or evocations.  Overall you're probably just going to peter out, but you can try to take it slowly in Shoals and see if you can regenerate HP through Makhleb. Or possibly try the Elf/Depths/Vault since those areas are more closed off. Animated weapons only exist on Elf:2 at the hall of blades which is always separated by a rune door. So don't open that door and you'll be fine (until something on Elf:3 blasts you apart). You could also blow some of your potions of Curing for a little (and emphasis on little) extra hp.  But...

(also train more fighting, 15 at minimum for where you are now).   While I personally think shoals should be fine, it is an open area, which can be dangerous. Vaults on the other hand consists of many small, well separated rooms, easy to retreat to a chokepoint. Go there. EDIT: Wait you have not been to elven halls? With your resistances 1-3 without endvault is easy peasy as long as you take care around demonologists and sorcerers. As for animated weapons, how about NOT opening the giant runed doors behind they are all 100% safely incarcerated???   As for demons... yes they are a double edged sword.

Just in general having summoned 45 greater demons by this point with only 11 invocations seems a little crazy to me! Not to mention the 30 lesser demons. All of those summons cost you HP (as do the major destruction spells which have also been used a lot). You want to freely use god abilities, but there is so much as too freely."

You'll absolutely need rN+++ rC+++ and rF+++, not necesarilly all at the same time, but for specific branches.  rN+++ is probably needed for all the branches though.  I had that for free with TSO though, but on the fire and cold themed branches of hell you can swap out the rC and rF for them.

dcss,3bqka5,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna second the equipment advice others have given.  Those boots are terrible.  They are worse than wearing no boots in about 90% of situations, and much, much worse than wearing a pair of boots that doesn't do anything horrible.  You already have more strength than you'll ever need, especially in Pearl Dragon Armour, the -AC is really, really bad, and the rPois and rElec are situational and not always worth losing that much AC for even when you are fighting enemies that use elec or poison.  The eveningstar is good, but the demon whip is better against enemies that aren't undead or demons, especially with less than 16 M&F skill.  Stop training shields right now.  You're already at enough shield skill to eliminate the penalty of your shield, and armour and dodging will help your defenses much more than more SH will.  Training more shield skill would only really be useful if you wanted to use a large shield, but that's almost never worth it unless you don't really have anything else to spend XP on, especially since +2 slaying on a regular shield is quite nice (especially with a demon whip).  Elf 3 is slow.  Trying to take it on quickly is very dangerous.  Slowly shouting to get the attention of a few elves at a time and pulling them out of the vault is the way to do it.  If you're not already using a killhole, I'd recommend digging one, it's very effective there (use disintegration and possibly digging to dig a little diagonal passage in the wall so that when you stand in the back of the passage, only the tile next to use is visible).  If you find yourself dealing with more elf casters at once than you're okay with and you can't make it back to your killhole, that scroll of silence you have will be extremely useful.

I didn't have resist mutation for the slime pit but I did have an alter of zin to go to to convert and get rid of some 9 million horrible mutations that were causing every single one of my stats to decay.  Then switched back to TSO for pandemonium.  It was exciting seeing Hell and Pandemonium for the first time, but I can't really say that I'm a big fan of how pandemonium works.  It seems drawn out longer than it has to be.  I ended up going through every first gate that I saw after getting the second pandemonium rune until I got the unique messages.  I think the fact that I got ridiculously lucky and the first shop that I went to hard an artifact +14 shadow dragon armor for 2002 gold with a bunch of positive traits and 1 negative pip on fire ice resistance helped out a lot.  I ended up saving all my gold until after I made it far enough to clear enough of the mines to be able to afford it.  The only time I didn't use that armor was for the fire themed branch of hell.

Are you training invocations and using both of Oka's god powers on strong fights?    Are you over training your weapon skill past getting min delay?  (Right click your weapon to see what min delay is for a given weapon)  Are you training dodge at all?  It's still an important skill, but as a heavy armor fighter you can just concentrate on it when it's easy to get ""free"" levels on it.  Like 1 or 2 enemies will get you a level in it come mid game, so I like to try and train it if leveling it is fast.  Also, Minotaur feels like I'm cheating when I play a heavy armor melee fighter.  They're by far the strongest warrior race IMO.  Maybe a formacid would be better if they had better aptitudes because of the two handed weapon and shield perk (but fuck the no tele/blink scrolls perk), but minotaurs level all the skills that a fighter could want at a ridicuous rate and also get a free extra counter attack that stays suprisingly relevant throughout the game.

So I don't know what kinda bad-ass amulet are you wearing but amulet of gourmand would trivialize food problems at least for clearing vaults:5. Otherwise it is pretty much the worst amulet in the game after inaccuracy ofc.  Pandemonium is usually pretty loaded with food. But it is not guaranteed.

dcss,3bm6zi,pereza0,5,Tue Jun 30 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"Overall your skilling seems pretty good. But you could have put some more point in DEX.  Examine your armour, the encumbrance rating is the strength at which penalties due to wearing it go down sharply, past that point you get diminishing returns for further strength... As you can see you have long surpassed them.  Those points would have been better invested in DEX, improving your EV and chance to hit stuff.  As for progressing in Shoals, get Clarity, MR or use Trog's Hand in the presence of sirens/avatars to avoid mesmerization. I dont know if stasis works against that too, but it would be a good combo with that randart ring  And for Snake, use shouting to pull small numbers of enemies, retreat when beneath 60% health even of things don't feel too threatening and heal (never know when something dangerous can show up) and remember you can just outrun almost every dangerous thing there  Berserk against individual dangerous non-blinking enemies and dont be conservative in the use of Brothers in Arms"
dcss,3bm6zi,zxc223,4,Tue Jun 30 10:30:12 2015 UTC,"Strategic stuff:  Drop the chain mail (unless you can get rC from say a ring), get some plate with a useful ego like rPois. Use ctrl-f to find items, in case you didn't know about it. See if you can buy useful potions and scrolls from shops. Are there no useful rings to wear in your second slot? Your skills look good. As mentioned by others, dex will help you a lot more than str at this point. Don't use cure mutation on a minor problem like -2 Dex; save it for something really bad like -10% hp or teleportitis. You should be able to clear shoals 1-4 with some care, and then get the snake rune (avoid shoals 5). Then, proceed into vaults 1-4, but be sure to look up enemies you don't recognise.  Tactical stuff:  Against mermaids and sirens, use the trog's hand ability to gain MR so you are unlikely to be mesmerised and pulled to the water. Clarity also prevents that, and scrolls of noise and fear can break out of it, as well as lightning wands. Invis (you have an invis ring) is really good in shoals, as not many enemies in there can see invis. In snake pit, be sure to lure enemies far away from their allies, and fight small numbers at a time. If you are meticulous about fighting as few enemies at a time as possible, you will have no problem."

Shoals: shoals is bad, because    a) low MR (trogs hand helps, but only before you are feared/mesmerized) b) you rc- and there are monsters how hurt ice spells at you you dont use invisibility!

OOD just does a lot of damage on a single spell school and costs a little less mana.  You need a way to sustain mana if you're going to blast pan lords, though that may not apply equally to all spells/strategies.  You'll also probably want to be carrying around an enhancer staff because lets be realistic, you're not going to melee a pan lord in caster weight armor with a demon whip.  If you are an extended game character you're pretty much just saving your consumables for the pan lords, the hell lords, and Tomb. So the tougher pan fights are your time to pop those consumables.  Also if you can I'd pare down your known spells to help your servitor out. Like drop fireball and/or sticky flame to encourage it to cast OOD, iron shot, and bolt of fire. You really could also drop bolt of fire which is nice because then they it won't cast it against fire resistant monsters."

I thought I screwed myself, but he still did a ton of damage, was there even an effect?   Sacrificing a paw would cost you a ring slot and the offhand punch of your melee attack (lowers your unarmed damage by about 20%).  On a normal race, it also means you can no longer use two-handed weapons or shields.   Also, what affects unarmed damage, dex? str?   I believe both dex an str do, although I'm not sure about the details.  Unarmed skill is by far the biggest factor, of course.   How can you tell how high the armour or shield skill will need to be to mitigate casting penalties?   For shields, examine it.  On a normal size race, it's 4 for bucklers, 15 for regular shields, 25 for large shields I believe.  Higher requirements on smaller races, lower requirements on larger races and formicids.  For armour, it's impossible to fully eliminate the penalty, and your strength stat has a much bigger effect on reducing the penalty than armour skill does.  As a general guideline, it's best to have about as much strength as the ER of your armour, but that's just a guideline, not a strict cutoff point.  (The main point of raising armour skill is to increase the AC you get from your armour).   Should I just ignore the penalty and keep upping my magic to compensate instead?   Yeah, training magic skills is generally more effective for reducing spell failure rates in heavy armour than training armour skill is (and it also boosts your spellpower).   How do casters without access to repel missiles survive?   Good positioning and management of LOS, making sure you still train your defensive skills (fighting and dodging, usually).  If you're having trouble surviving without repel missiles, there's a good chance you're trying to fight a lot of enemies with ranged attacks in an open area.  Try to get their attention one at a time or lure them to better terrain (somewhere where they can't all bombard you together).  This can be hard against fast ranged enemies like Yaktaurs, though.  Crowd control abilities like hexes or mephitic cloud, or repositioning abilities like translocations can also help.   edit: I mean, would it affect scoring in some way like it wouldn't count as a win if I choose a bad build?   It counts as a win if you leave the dungeon with the Orb of Zot, no matter what your build is.  The biggest factors on your score are the number of runes you have and the number of turns in took.  Other things like experience can also impact it.   I normally stick to ""approved"" builds, but I noticed if you pick a species first, it gives a different list of approved builds than if you choose profession first. Like only spriggans get artificer, but if you pick artificer first, there are like five approved species. Is this just a suggestion I should ignore (I play on akrasiac)?   Those are ""recommended"" builds, not approved builds.  They're there to help new players pick effective race/background combinations, that's it.    In addition to the fact that some background/race pairings work better than others, races sort of serve as DCSS's difficulty systems.  Mummies and Formicids are considered challenge races, for example, and are deliberately much harder to win with than more races, while Hill Orcs, Minotaurs, or Gargoyles tend to be on the easier side.  Some classes, most notably wanderer and chaos knight, are also on the hard side.  The recommendation system is asymmetrical to help with things like chaos knights, mummies, or wanderers.  If you pick a background and want to know what races go well with it, mummy is basically never a good recommendation, but if you pick mummy, you still want to know what a good background choice is.  Similarly, chaos knight is basically never a good recommendation for any race, but if you want to be a chaos knight then some races are better recommendations than others.  If you want to ignore the recommendations, you can do so safely.  The worst case scenario is you end up with a really hard-to-play build."

But what about spells? Still dex? Int? Spell power?   Spell power does. I don't know about stats.   I had a felid that was worshipping ru and then I mistakenly sacrificed a paw. I thought I screwed myself, but he still did a ton of damage, was there even an effect? Also, what affects unarmed damage, dex? str?   I think that it only removes the offhand punch, so you still do decend damage. I don't know about skills.   How can you tell how high the armour or shield skill will need to be to mitigate casting penalties?   For shields, it is written in the infos of the shield (for usual species, 4 for bucklers, 15 for shields).  For armour, I am not sure but I would say that improving the skill always improves the cast success, but with decreasing gains. So at some point, generally coming quite fast, it is more efficient to train the skill. The same goes for training strength or intelligence to remove casting penalties.   How do casters without access to repel missiles survive?   I would say that there is no reason not to have repel missiles if you cast spells (or more generally if you don't worship trog). If you insist or don't find it, usual advice applies, avoid open spaces, be very careful about LOS (block it with your summons (especially summon butterflies)), don't hesitate to use scrolls of fog, blast dangerous ranged enemies on sight.   edit: I mean, would it affect scoring in some way like it wouldn't count as a win if I choose a bad build?

This is probably a bug. When you find bugs, please report them.  Edit: I was wrong. Here is the [excellent] explanation of why it works like this:   This is because some races and backgrounds are easier than others, and because it allows us to keep the recommended lists at similar lengths. To do it the old symmetrical way would mean that (for example) either mummy would recommend very few backgrounds, or several backgrounds would recommend mummy even though other races would be better for that background than mummy is. Neither of those is what we want, so we now have this system that lets us tune the lists independently."

What I would do is: first, I'd check using Control + F if there are any items that I may have missed.  Second, I'd like to do Slime Pits, for the loot. However, I'd prefer to have rMut available for Shining Eyes. It probably can be done without, with the right tactics (using meat shields to break LoS, summoning butterflies, using summons, etc.). Even more considering you have the 66% resistance of the mutation.  What I do in Slime Pits is just descend straight to the 6th level, using stairdancing to kill the mobs. Acid blobs are the main threat. It can be done even without rCorr, if playing very carefully.  Once on the 6th level, first I stairdance whatever mobs show up, and then go straight to the middle, and as soon as I see TRJ, I buff myself (haste, might, agi, utility spells, whatever), quaff a potion of resistance if I don't have rCorr and summon stuff to fill the corridor so that TRJ can't summon. After that, I just melee it. Sometimes it tries to escape (especially if it's able to switch places with its own summons). Wands or rods help here. If it manages to summon acid blobs and I get corroded, as soon as TRJ dies, I teleport away, recover and come back later to deal with the summons.  Crypt is also a possibility. First two floors shouldn't be too dangerous, and I think third floor is easier than Elf:3 or Vaults:5. I'd like to have some rN to do it, though. I'd say that if you've never done Slime, go Crypts.  Another possibility is going to Zot, in order to get a MR cloak from draconians.  Elf I wouldn't do without at least MR++.  I'd also like to have MR for Vaults:5. Very dangerous on its own (these days I usually prefer to do Slime Pits for my 3rd rune with melee chars), it has vaults sentinels, which may mark you, and the occasional paralyzing monster.

dcss,3bhg1b,jmainvi,5,Mon Jun 29 06:34:43 2015 UTC,"You need to decide what you want to do with the character, which will vastly inform your upcoming strategy. Basically: go for a straight 3 rune win or try for more extended gameplay?  If you are going for a 3 rune, your current setup (vamp weapon + throwing) is sufficient. If you want to play the extended game, vamp begins to suffer as a large amount of creatures you fight will be immune to the effect. Additionally, your low ranged damage will become more and more of an issue. If I was going for extended I would try to find another good weapon and a switchable ranged launcher (which is difficult because you are invested in shields: the only launchers which can work are slings and hand xbows?).  While your gear does look quite nice, 30AC/EV and 114 hp can be destroyed VERY quickly against some of the tougher encounters you will face. Specifically, elf3 or vaults5 are NOT to be trifled with and with a bit of bad luck either one could easily turn your character into mulch.  As you need a 3rd rune, your main options are either Abyss or Vaults5. Abyss is quite painful without rMut (your mutation intrinsic is a lesser version of rMut and is not to be relied upon), so I suggest coming up with a plan to break vaults 5.  For the low cost of 2 enchant weapon scrolls, opening the treasure vault seems like a no brainer to me."
dcss,3bhg1b,holdingthebaby,2,Mon Jun 29 06:53:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not super invested into shields, really. I don't have an excellent shield, it isn't providing me any critical resistances, and before I did snake:4 I only had level 5. Shields aren't too exp-expensive and there isn't much to train with trog. I think an arbalest is certainly possible soon, at the opportunity cost of that potential evocations and maybe holding off on dodging/armour. What point of the game does it become a big deal to have that strong ranged attack?  I almost posted that I had rMut available, but I mix it up with rCorr (which IS available) far too often, so it's a good thing I checked. Looks like the plan then is to clear vaults 1-4 and maybe the rest of elf in search of the two enchant weapon scrolls and rMut that I need, while NOT investing more in shields, then reevaluate."
dcss,3bhg1b,holdingthebaby,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I understand, gifts from scrolls of acquisition (and Trog gifts which use similar code) look at your trained skills and try to give you things which fit to your trained build. This means, in effect, that Trog will give you more 1 handers than 2 handers now that he sees you are trained in shields.  Trog also gifts ammo for ranged weapons: if you have any skill training in a ranged type, he will give ammo of that type. I think with 5 throwing you should have already gotten lots of javelins / tomahawks.  In both cases, if you knew ahead of time that you were going to use 2 handed weapons, and also a 2 handed launcher, it would have been slightly more efficient to not train shields and not train throwing at all. By avoiding training those skills you avoid ""confusing"" Trog and have a better chance to be gifted stuff that you want for your intended build.  By no means does this mean your character is trash-- I'm sure an experienced player could easily win with your current character as-is.  As for when in your career having a ranged attack is good/needed: I don't know, exactly. I've had characters die trying to ranged duel a Yaktaur, I've also had characters take out super high threat opponents with ranged weapons. The way I would express it is that having STRONG ranged damage is a very important and useful tool, and lacking that tool it hurts your ability to handle certain situations.  As stated in my first post, I think you can get away with not training a launcher at all (and keeping the vampiric blade) if you are going for a 3 rune win. For a planned longer run, go for a bow or xbow and a 2 handed sword."
dcss,3bhg1b,sisforsawesome,3,Mon Jun 29 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Second what /u/holdingthebaby said, also you shouldn't prioritize stealth with plate armor on. If you have any gear with rC+, have it ready to swap in for the vaults, as even 1 rank gives 50% damage reduction. If not, check enemy spell sets, watch for simulacra, and be ready to use a potion of resistance.  After vaults 1-4 I would recommend Elf 3 and Crypt. Maybe Elf first because vampirism will work there and you have plenty of MR. Also you have a chance of getting a better shield there (resistances or even protection are usually preferred). A trick you can do with the wand of digging is to cut a zigzag path of diagonals, like so:  #### .### #.#@ ##.# ####   This way casters can't target you from afar. Can be helpful for the Elf: 3 vault among other things."
dcss,3bgtnc,qftvfu,6,Mon Jun 29 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"Great swords are a great mix of low skill required, high damage, and good availability in the game (wights often have them with good brands).

dcss,3bgtnc,triorph,3,Mon Jun 29 04:03:54 2015 UTC,"Long Blades are about the second best weapon type after M&F (their only disadvantage is that they are somewhat rarer, but once you got them they are as good or if you go 2H better) and they are definitely better than axes (probably the worst weapon type).

Cleaving shows more its benefits the more suicidal you are.  Most species are not particularly good with them either and its only for Hill Orcs that they seem to be on a bit more of an equal footing with the alternatives.  They are also basically meant to be used two-handed, not a bad thing but more restrictive (eg: if you have heavily invested in them and find a cool shield you will not be able to take advantage of it as well as a M&F or Lbl user can).  Overall, even if its the worst it doesn't mean its bad or unviable, just that the other options might  be more appealing. If you like them or they suit your style by all means use them, this is just my opinion"

dcss,3bgtnc,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Mon Jun 29 09:15:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You should often be running from hydras anyway: using long blades is a good reminder that you shouldn't just tab them.

dcss,3bgtnc,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Mon Jun 29 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"I tend to use either Maces & Flails (with guaranteed HydraSafe™ technology and excellent damage on great maces) or Axes (with cleaving damage and cross-training to both M&F and reachable Polearms). In principle a triple sword is superior to the best weapons of either type, but in general I don't think you can beat the interaction of those two weapon types for general flexibility.  The problem with Long Blades is kind of a negative one; they don't have the niche uses that all the other types have (stabbing, reaching, cleaving, hydra killing, synergy with spellcasters for Staves). That makes them not as good in the long term."
dcss,3bgtnc,killdudes,2,Mon Jun 29 11:31:25 2015 UTC,"Long blades offer a nice middle ground between whips (bad vs high AC targets outside of a few brands) and Eveningstars (16 skill investment). Plus scimitars are more common than morningstars in my experience. There's also the str/dex weight where M&F are heavily Str based (outside of demon whips), but a demon blade is still mostly dex weighed.  It think for a hybrid, where hydra killing can come in other forms, long blades are an attractive option unless you're willing to hold out for a demon whip of electrocution. They have a pretty smooth arc where the early blades are effective with a natural progression to late game choices."
dcss,3bgtnc,Slogo,2,Mon Jun 29 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"To add my 2 cent. I've got around 3 wins on Crawl so far, (Would have had a 4th but I died on the run out... fucking teleport trap....)  Two were with M&F, One was with Long Swords.  Not only basing my judgment on that, but the many games I've started and died from, Long Swords seem to have a better early game progression, but you can hit a wall if you get unlucky, where-as M&F's progression is alllllllright.... But Demon Whips are plentiful.  The only big difference I feel between the two is that Usually if you're going M&F you get a shield, where-as Long Swords you're gonna want a Triple Sword or bust, so a Shield goes out the window unless you're a Formicid, and the lack of a shield later in the game is something I do notice, although if you're worshiping Makhleb you probably wont.  The only problem I have with Long Blades is how sparse they are in comparison to Demon Whips, the game is random, but if I'm running a Long Blades character I feel compelled to pick Trog/Oka because I'll never reach a Triple Sword without them, compare that to a Demon Whip where you're basically guaranteed to find one by the end of the Vault (Basically, I've only had 1 run so far where I've gotten to the end of V:5 and not replaced my Whip of Electrocution), so if you play the numbers game M&F are statistically a safer option."

dcss,3be71v,Quazifuji,2,Sun Jun 28 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Also, is a 2 handed axe really worth giving up a shield?   For axes, you definitely should go two-handed.  Broad axes aren't very good (unless you find Arga or a comparably insan randart), while battle axes and exec axes are much better.  If you want to go with one-hander and shield, you should usually go with something else, since demon weapons, double swords, and eveningstars are all significantly better than broad axes.  Even with other weapon types, two handers are often better, but for axes you should really almost always go two-handed."
dcss,3be71v,porp_crawl,2,Mon Jun 29 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"With axes, unless you find a superior one-hander, you'll want to go as big and heavy a 2 hander as you can get your hands on.  Early in the game, Pois is useful but it becomes less useful in a melee weapon than a ranged weapon far faster.  However, that war axe is relatively fast and the (very rarely resisted) Elec brand does damage-independent chunks of damage. I'd try it out hoping that something much better procs. Weapon switch between the two depending on specific targets."
dcss,3be71v,Infamously_Unknown,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:29:34 2015 UTC,"is a 2 handed axe really worth giving up a shield?   If you already have enough survivability from other sources, then yes. If you can manage not die easily without a shield, there's no point in overkilling your defense, especially given that you'll eventually meet stuff that ignores your armor and shield. At that point, being able to kill faster helps more than another layer of protection.  EDIT: I mean this in general, I never played DD yet."
dcss,3be71v,zxc223,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think most likely the war axe is better at typical skill levels, as elec is excellent. Ideally you will want a freezing/vamp/flaming/antimagic/elec battleaxe down the line, maybe executioner's axe if good apts + spare xp lategame."
dcss,3bf1ib,malboro_urchin,5,Sun Jun 28 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"My go-to Cj strategy is just to push conjurations until the battlesphere/magic dart combo is online and reliable.

dcss,3bbsag,zaopd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"I mostly farmed the first floor as it's the safest. I think the best way to find more items is to repeatedly leave and re-enter the abyss, as items are a bit more likely to spawn when you first enter. It's also a bit safer since you get to rest and possible change items whenever you leave.  Obviously you want to already have the abyssal rune, so exits spawn much more frequently. If you're strong enough to get it, you might be strong enough to raid the abyss. Besides a strong character all-around (good offense, defense, resistances), you especially want rMut, and at least either stealth to avoid battles or regeneration/channeling to recover from them faster. Teleportation is also very helpful. My character already had attack options up to Glaciate, but I wanted to level armour for a randart I found in Zot and evocations for my staff of energy.  I stopped because I had leveled my skills up adequately and had plenty of consumables to try extended for the first time, and also because of boredom."

Freezing cloud is also fantastic.  I have the same response as /u/SvalbardCaretaker about the haunt + tornado combo.  I haven't heard of it, but I'm guessing whatever it was no longer works due to summons not really working out of LOS any more.

dcss,3bb6xt,JamesBronn,2,Sat Jun 27 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"A blowgun is a side weapon generally. You would need melee as well.  I think hardcore people enchant the blowgun to maximum and pump up Throwing, using needles of paralysis or sleeping on enemies."
dcss,3bb6xt,urchigold,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:52:02 2015 UTC,Dropping the weapon wasn't serious haha. So it is worth while to put some enchant scrolls into a blowgun just for the accuracy since needles don't really do any considerable damage?
dcss,3bb6xt,sir_pirriplin,2,Sat Jun 27 15:59:35 2015 UTC,You should enchant your blowgun if you get some needles with special effects like paralysis or confusion. Regular poisoned needles are not affected by enchantment.  And you should train throwing if you want to be able to shoot faster. That helps when kiting enemies.

dcss,3bb6xt,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Sat Jun 27 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"You get very little benefit from it unless you have powerful effect needles (like paralysis) and the skill to back them up. Throwing skill affects the chance of status effects (other than poison, which works unskilled) from needless working. At low skill the effect needles just aren't great. At high skill you can paralyze and stab Cerebov.  If you get into needle stabbing, which is more of a late game thing (because ammo and skill level), enchanting a blowgun is worthwhile, since it improves your consistency (which is good for your survival). In the early game though, you'll probably get more survivability from having a reliable, strong weapon."

But your starting skill is enough for that.   A really fun thing to do: if you are a stealthy character, and have a good blowgun/throwing skill, your curare needles get stabbing bonus damage. You can one-shot sleeping orb guardians(!) with it. (and of course any other non-rpois monster as well)."

Getting my throwing skill up to have my tomahawks of returning come back most of the time really helped a lot with pulling enemies into advantageous positions for me, and often times flat out just killing half of them before they could get to me.  Otherwise, luck with good item drops seems to be a huge factor."
dcss,3b9wgj,t1ngol,2,Sat Jun 27 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a lot of it just came down to luck.  I only started playing DCSS a couple weeks ago, and lost so many characters because I kept refusing to learn that important lesson of not trying to kill everything I saw, and also knowing when to run.    I got really lucky with a lot of the items I found.  I can't remember which, but in one of those little off-zone portals I went through I had a ton of kobolds chucking tomahawks of returning at me, and after killing them all I ended up with just over 50.  That was when I invested into the throwing skill and it helped me big time.  If you do try out the KoAr, start out just with the normal fighting skills, get short blades up to maximize attack speed, and otherwise just don't be afraid to burn wands and whatnot.  As for using decks effectively, I can't really say there's a set strategy to it.  Part of it was that by mid game I had found way more scrolls of identify than I needed so I was using those to constantly know what cards I would get next, and I always kept at least 3 of each deck that Nemelex gifted.  Also, by late game I found that I was relying on the elemental summon items (lamp of fire, phial of floods, etc) and the three rods I found a lot more than any of my wands or decks.  Just keep trying and eventually you'll get a good idea of what you need to do.  Cautiousness is key."

I would have had fighting at 27 before getting my weapon skill up to 27, fighting will give you less weapon damage, but more HP is nice. Your strength also didn't need to be so high, GDA's encumbrance is 23, you were fine at about 25ish. It would have been better to raise dex at that point, get a higher EV.

My first win was actually a DECj, and even after that I remained bad at melee for quite a while. So it doesn't always go that way. Don't feel too discouraged. CeHu is considered to be one of the easier starts in the game (primarily because of the fast movement of Ce).

Meleebros generally don't need to worry about hunger* or mana and there are a lot fewer tactical panic moments for melee guys in the early/mid game especially. Until much later there's no monsters that are more scary for a melee guy than a caster. The worst case you have a monster a melee guy needs to run from, but running from a monster as a melee guy is still less scary than turning a corner as a caster and being adjacent/close to that same monster. With fewer offensive skills to invest in you'll also have higher fighting/dodging/armor than a caster counterpart.  Hus are good of a few different races. My first win was a Halfling Hunter and it was a pretty smooth run. Probably even better then since I've done it since the crosstraining change and the sling/throwing crosstrain.  *Food at a strategic level is pretty easy for casters, but there are certainly points in the game where you may have a 4+ star hunger spell that you can't just spam in battle without going to starving."

Weak enemies will often refuse to enter the cloud, allowing you to use it to block a corridor and blast enemies from behind it, and enemies that ignore it take a lot of damage if you can get them to sit in the cloud.  Summons are tricky to use with fire magic, since they can sometimes get in the way of your spells.  That said, meat shields are extremely useful for a caster, and Lightning Spire and Summon Ice Beast are both fantastic early game spells if you can get them online without devoting too much experience.  Cause Fear and Enslavement are also excellent defensive spells that might be worth considering, as long as you're happy with your offenses and basic defensive stats.  Doesn't look like you have it yet, but you'll eventually want to aim for bolt of fire if you can find it.  That can carry your offense through the rest of the game (aside from fire immune monsters, you'll eventually need to find some way to deal with them).  Don't worry too much about firestorm if you find it - it's extremely fun to use, but takes a buttload of experience and isn't necessary at all - it's a luxury, not a priority.  Even as a DE, it's not a bad idea to get a basic level of melee competence eventually.  A Staff of Fire will be the ideal option, but if you find a nice low-investment weapon like a demon blade or a lajatang that's also worth considering.  If you don't get any melee, you'll want some source of channeling (channeling is good even if you use melee, of course, but it's mandatory to at least have one of the two so you're not completely helpless when you run out of mana).  If you kill a steam dragon, mottled dragon, or quicksilver dragon, make sure you butcher it, they're all fairly rare and their hides hides make very good caster armours (you don't need to enchant it right away, but it's good at least have the hide available for later).  No shame in having trouble with a spiny frog.  Spiny frogs are arguably one of the most dangerous enemies in lair, especially for a fire elementalist, because unlike other nasty things like hydras or death yaks, you can't just walk away from them."

That said, meat shields are extremely useful for a caster, and Lightning Spire and Summon Ice Beast are both fantastic early game spells if you can get them online without devoting too much experience.   I had played around with a summoner a little, and CCF seemed to do a much better job of meatshielding than the imps did. I'm not sure when to focus my xp towards the Lightning Spire and Ice Beast though, because while I have some skill in summoning, I have absolutely none in Ice or Air."

Figuring out when to diversify your spell pool and when to train your main offense school or your non-spell skills is always a challenge.  I'm honestly not sure what the right answer here it.  For ice beast, the answer might be as simple as ""when your canine familiar isn't enough anymore"".  Lightning spire's more of an offensive spell than a defensive one, although air magic also goes nicely with the book of clouds you have (but that's much more long term, and freezing cloud goes very poorly with bolt of fire if you get that going eventually)."
dcss,3b0gls,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your insights!   Any advice on how I should use the spells I have memorized? I always have extra trouble with Lair as opposed to Dungeon because of the layout: so much of Lair is wide open space, and even when I have the luxury of Blink, I still find myself in melee range to an unsafe degree.  Dungeon is relatively easy, even with orc priests (who have actually never given me too too much trouble) and crimson imps (Sif Muna's ballsack, I hate those), because corridors are commonplace. I miss those corridors greatly in Lair"
dcss,3b0gls,Quazifuji,2,Thu Jun 25 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"Most of the spells you have are pretty straightforward.  Fireball does a bunch of damage, especially great for clearing out packs of weak enemies or killing high EV enemies (it can't miss) but it's also the highest damage ranged spell you have right now.    Throw flame you use when you want something with less mana cost and sound (but also a lot less damage) than fireball, good for getting something's attention or picking off weak enemies.  Flame tongue you use instead of throw flame when enemies are closer, its damage is comparable but it only costs half the mana.  Sticky flame you use against enemies in melee range.  For enemies that aren't faster than you, sticky flaming them then running away until it wears off is a very effective strategy.  This only works out if you can afford to take a hit on the turn you can sticky flame, so it won't work against incredibly dangerous enemies where spending one turn in melee range is super dangerous, but it's still your best offensive tool if an enemy's in melee range and you decide that killing them is safer than trying to escape.  Blink you cast when a random position is likely to be safer than your current position, obviously.  Can get you out of a tight spot or (hopefully) put space between you and an enemy that is closer than you like.  Shroud of Golubria you cast when you think a bit more defenses are more important than casting an extra throw flame.  In Lair, most enemies can be killed by casting sticky flame and then running away.  The main dangers are snakes and frogs (faster than you) and hydras (can do a lot of damage the turn you cast sticky flame).  Hydras you can probably kill with fireballs if you start far enough away, or at least get them low enough with fireballs to finish them off with sticky flame when they get close, as long as they don't have enough heads to one-shot you.  When dealing with packs like yaks or elephants, see if you can separate them and pick them off one by one with sticky flame.  Fireball's good for packs, but it's hard to kill a whole herd of elephants or death yaks with fireballs before running out of mana, and fireball's noise means you're likely to get the whole pack's attention.  Don't be afraid to run away from anything that's not faster than you.  When in doubt, run.  If you're not confident you can kill a hydra, run.  If you're not confident that you can kill a pack of death yaks or elephants, run.  When in doubt, run away and reassess the situation, see if you can come up with a better approach.  Black Mambas and Spiny Frogs are argubly the most dangerous enemies in lair, because they're the most dangerous ones that you can't run away from.  Ideally, you can blast those down with fireball quickly.  Don't be afraid to use consumables if you're uncertain."

That said its halfway viable; octopus ring trident will start loosing steam soon, so look out in shoals for a nice demon trident, there are usually a few.

Get controlled blink. Get tukimas to disarm monsters with dangerous weapons.(halfof shoals.)  That's assuming you have those spells of course... if you're limited to the spells in your books you're carrying just get phase shift and shadow creatures online by late vaults.  At this stage I would stick with robes. That's a good stabber robe so you need to carry a dagger. You will have stab opportunities if you use it right. Id train stealth first.

No, unless you literally have no other source for resistances. Or if you're going to complete a couple of zigs and max several skills. Otherwise, go for a lighter armor like fda, ida, qda, pda(ideally).  Also training schools of magic is vastly superior to training armor skill for the purpose of heavy armor spellcasting."
dcss,3ayafk,T0lias,2,Wed Jun 24 15:24:28 2015 UTC,Thanks that helps give me perspective.  Honestly I was just excited about getting a good randart.  I started thinking about how much XP i'd be diverting into armor just to get an extra pip or two of resistance and decided to stick with light armor instead.
dcss,3ayafk,Slogo,3,Wed Jun 24 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's probably not even extra resistances since if you are wearing GDA you would want to be using Blade Hands over Statue Form (otherwise why wear armor?). Once you do that you'd be melding your rings & shield during combat most of the time which makes it more of a trade-off rather than gaining resistances (possibly even a net loss).  I think there's plenty viability in wearing the GDA in some situations, but you can also just clear everything with statue form. Overall your defenses should probably be higher in statue form since you'd keep more of your EV score (oddly enough), the HP bonus, and Naga's have poorly fitting armor penalties.  Another thing that could tip the scales (either way) are spells you may want to cast. Blade Hands Spell casting penalty + GDA would make it unlikely that you could cast any additional spells while the transmutation was active. Statue form would allow you to take advantage of your int and cast other high level spells, notably and importantly spells like cBlink, silence, or other useful utility spells."
dcss,3ayafk,Piginabag,2,Wed Jun 24 15:56:42 2015 UTC,Wearing GDA as a transmuter is completely pointless as body armor melds in statue form (and all other forms).

dcss,3awk2j,Ztang,4,Wed Jun 24 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"General advice is to train ""kill dudes"" skills before defense. The faster you kill, the less time enemies have to kill you. Once you feel you're killing dudes sufficiently fast, pour some exp into defenses. I typically train only 2 skills at a time. For melee: Offense (primary weapon skill), defense (fighting, dodging, armour, shields), and utility (invocation, utility, throwing, ranged weapon skill).   There are general benchmarks to aim for, but with a HoFi wielding 2H axes, you should know that the skill required to reach min delay (the minimum amount of time between your attacks) is quite high. So axes will probably get turned on and stay on. The best quality axe (Executioner's) has min delay requiring 26 skill (out of 27 total skill points). On my melee characters using 2handers, I juggle between fighting, armour, and dodging, trying to keep the first two roughly even (few points in one, then a few in the other) and dodging at roughly two-thirds their value (because I'm usually in heavy armour).  You'll often find a metric ton of wands, and you're perfectly fine to play around with evocation. With Qaz as your diety, though, invocation will get you further. You typically want to save your recharge scrolls for the best 3 wands (heal wounds, haste, teleport), because they are simply far more important than the others.  Here's an example of my first 3 rune win (on the streamlined MiBe): I had maxed the skills on Axes, Fighting, and Armour (and maybe even dodging?), but had little if any exp into anything else (and didn't need it). The key is to micro manage your exp and make sure you're hitting the benchmarks for your race and background (e.g., DE have a huge health penalty, and so a benchmark for them may be having >100 health before they tackle Depths).  I hope this helps. I should note: I've only won three times (3 rune MiBe, 3 rune DDBe, and 15 rune GrFi), and am far from an expert."

What I should have done is bailed out at ~fireball #3 or so with a teleport scroll, but again, it was 1 on 1, and i'd killed two of them with zero problems before this guy.  And you're right about making good decisions early instead of trying to play catchup at 25% hp.  Honestly, the shield training was an experiment.

dcss,3awk2j,Quazifuji,3,Wed Jun 24 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"In generall, you shouldn't be walking towards a fire giant hoping he doesn't use too many fireballs on you.  If you see a fire giant in the distance and want to fight him in melee combat, back off around a corner to cut off vision and force him to come to you.  Don't give him the chance to fireball you 5 times before you've gotten close.  One of the best pieces of advice I've ever seen for Crawl is rule 0 of Patashu's Rules:   Rule 0: You should almost never move towards an enemy that is in your line of sight. It's not due to one reason, but it's a heuristic due to a few different reasons. In general, you usually want to retreat from an enemy you have just seen rather than approach it.   Taking a step away from an enemy is arguably the most important ability in the entire game.  (All of Patashu's rules are fantastic, by the way, I highly recommend reading the whole thing).   Honestly, the shield training was an experiment. Qazlal gives shields despite my wielding a 2hander, I wanted to find out if training shields would improve qazlals, but I should have just focused those xp into invocation.   Even when using shields, you should almost never use a large shield unless you're a big race or formicid.  The investment to eliminate the penalty is just so huge, and the XP is almost always better spent elsewhere.  You should also almost never use one-handed axes, even as a Hill Orc.  Their experience requirements are high and their damage is low relative to a good one-handed mace or long blade.  Even with cleaving and HO aptitudes, I wouldn't use axes if I wanted to use shields (unless I found some insane randart broad axe or an arga early on, but that usually isn't the case)."

And yeah, rule 0 is big.  Crawl is all about positioning.  Walking towards an enemy almost always means putting yourself in a more vulnerable position than walking away from an enemy.  You can get away with it a lot, especially on a tanky charcter like a HoFi of Qaz, but it's basically never what you should be doing.    Even when it's just a melee enemy, the area behind you is, on average, much safer than the area in front of you.  Most of the time, the area behind you is explored and cleared territory, while the area in front of you is partially obscured and could contain enemies not in sight yet, so stepping backwards or standing still and letting the enemy come to you is safer than walking towards them.

This can blow out enough turns to collapse, if you had some battles on the way that brought you to half hp, you're only half way to the gate and you have a potion of heal wounds, or extra curing, or wand of heal wounds, use one and keep going, a potion of heal wounds saves around 100 turns.  Trading a potion for the pots / gear in a portal is almost always worth it.  If your a magic user, only use rest function until mana pool is back (save your potions of magic until you actually need it, they're too precious in the early game)"
dcss,3asypz,mrzisme,5,Tue Jun 23 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"It's a judgment call. Rushing is bad, if it means walking towards monsters in open areas, but if it just means trying to explore a good chunk of the level quickly and taking routes trying to avoid battles then it's fine. Sometimes you can't find a safe route to explore and then it's best to just ignore the portal and proceed normally.  I almost always make a reasonable attempt find Sewers if I can handle adders. Ossuaries are also usually doable by the time they generate.  By the time the mid-game portals generate (Bailey, Ice Cave, Volcano, Labyrinth) I often have scroll of magic mapping that I use to find them.  Of the mid-game portals, my biggest killer has been Bailey. I tend to enter those if I find them anyway, but bail out quickly if I find a particulary nasty one. Ice Caves I go into if I think I can kill a couple of ice beasts; a pip of rC makes a big difference. Volcano without rF is risky.  I always try to find Labyrinths. The loot just feels too good to miss, and most of my characters have some way of dealing with the minotaur (berserk/haste/might/agility/invisibility, wands/rods/elemental evocables/ranged attacks to soften it up from distance).  TL;DR: Depends. Unless you think you're too squishy, make a reasonable attempt to find it, and don't hesitate to bail out if it looks to be too much to handle."
dcss,3asypz,ThreeInvisibleDucks,3,Tue Jun 23 12:21:39 2015 UTC,My game plan is usually Read a scroll of magic mapping and head towards it in a normal fashion. If an item spawns that would force me to explore more terrain to get I will leave it until after the portal. Otherwise I just proceed normally.
dcss,3asypz,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:27:12 2015 UTC,"Being alive but missing the portal is much better than being dead, obviously.  It's worth trying to explore the map quickly in order to find them, but I wouldn't take any significant risks.  As others have said, you can also always use magic mapping to find them quickly.  Personally, I'll almost always use magic mapping to find Bazaars or Wizlabs (mostly because Wizlabs are rare and interesting), sometimes for Labyrinths (tend to be pretty easy as long as you're not having food problems, which should be rare, and often have good loot).  The others I still look for, I just get less excited about them.  But then, as long as you find better loot than a scroll of magic mapping there it's worth using one to find it."
dcss,3asypz,Quazifuji,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"You're only wrong if you die. That said it is often (but not always) worth it to charge off after the gate. Portal loot is usually pretty good stuff. I will usually ignore loot on the way there to make sure I don't get sidetracked before I arrive.  Just make sure it's a portal you can handle before you drive yourself half to death getting there. Sewer is usually fairly safe, but don't do ossuary or labyrinth without some permafood, don't do volcano without at least rF+, don't do ice cave without at least rC+, and don't do a bailey without some way to kill a lot of annoying jerks on the other side of a moat. And for the volcano and ice cave, cut your losses and leave if there are statue rooms you don't have a way to handle."
dcss,3asypz,bigmcstrongmuscle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:10:15 2015 UTC,"Sewers and Ossuaries I will bum-rush with almost every character, they're not very difficult typically.  Ice Caves and Volcanoes are high risk, high reward and I'll generally check them out and bail if it's too much.  Ice Caves especially will have Dragons, Fiends, or statues that often are just too much for some characters at the point where you encounter the portal.  Labyrinths are usually a big payday for me, but very rarely i've had characters get absolutely destroyed by the random equipment the minotaur happened to use."

dcss,3apd1e,davidoux,6,Mon Jun 22 12:25:35 2015 UTC,"Felids are definitely not an ""easy"" race, but if you're enjoying playing them, that's what's important.  Changing gods generally means you'll have to deal with penance from the god you left. Normally it's not worth changing unless you have a specific reason for it (and changing gods this early into the game is probably a bad idea).  Generally, you'll want to focus first on training the skill that lets you kill things (for a Transmuter, that's Transmutation until you can safely cast your key spells) and then on defensive skills (Dodging and Fighting most notably for casters). I'll also point out that you'll likely want to start training Unarmed Combat at some point, as that will improve your attacks with your claws and in your various forms.  Regarding decks, you may want to read a little about Nemelex. You can also read about decks themselves. A key thing to note is that you can use Scrolls of Identification on a deck, and it will tell you the deck type and what the top card of the deck is. You can also flip cards from decks in a controlled environment to try to figure out what deck it is (and, therefore, what card you might draw next).  Ice Form is definitely useful, although swimming is more of a side benefit. There's no need to explore the water in the Temple... the only thing of note there are the altars. Ice Form gives you a good helping of defensive stats while you're in it, and it makes your unarmed attacks have the freeze brand (but it makes you vulnerable to fire). You could use it to help deal with those poison resistant monsters."

But, from what you've said, you probably need to train a lot more Unarmed Combat. That is a transmuter's main source of damage, and thus survivability.   You need a little stealth, so you can get away from fights that will kill you, and enough transmutation skill to get your main forms semi-reliable. Like, 15% failure rate on Spider Form is plenty of Tmut skill. And you will want quite a bit of dodging, since that is your main source of damage mitigation. And of course fighting, to try to avoid being one-shottable. But most of all, you want a ton of unarmed combat. All your transformations deal unarmed damage, and even the most powerful form won't do much with 0 unarmed combat. UC should be your highest-trained skill all game long."

If you haven't IDed either of those, it might be worthwhile to start quaffing unknown potions. However, you need to get away from those gnolls first, or you'll just get poisoned again.  I recommend reading one of your two blink scrolls to move you away from them and towards stairs. Then either start quaffing or use Triple Draw or Deal Four off a deck of Changes or Escape (Changes has three and Escape has two cards that are likely to save you).  If you manage to restore your HP or cure the poison, I would get to stairs and leave the level. Dealing with venom branded weapons in spider form is no fun."

Using Trog or Oka for gifts is less of a terrible idea, but I still wouldn't recommend it.  Switching from Trog or Oka for late game is reasonable, but the reasons to do so are mostly unrelated to gifts.  In general, I'd take a policy of ""when in doubt, don't switch gods"".

I also find that most casters starting books will keep them alive long enough to find most of the spells they reasonably want/need so it's not worth choosing a god for spells.

dcss,3ani83,pereza0,2,Mon Jun 22 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I also recently gained my first 15 rune win as a Deep Elf who started as an enchanter and worshipped Sif Muna to the very end. Channel Energy, hunger cost and all in Elf form--and even more OP in lich form--is just too amazing. I have never used a crystal ball of energy with success.  I won with Singularity, which makes kiting a breeze. Did you find that you had to kite big bosses? Did you find Haste+Controlled Blink to be enough for kiting? Or did you find that Firestorm/Glaciate were strong enough to blow up bosses before they blew you up and had no need for kiting?  Also, you have very high fire and ice magic. Did I miss something or do these two schools of magic not conflict with each other? I feel like that question must date me as an old crawler with a memory from a long-past version where conflicting schools of magic were a thing..."
dcss,3ani83,Griselidis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! I read your post, I really wanna try Singularity and the more offensive translocation spells, I typically only get them for the blink spells and cTele!  To answer your questions:  I had to kite some of the big bosses for sure! For Cerebov I had to haste and read a tele scroll to get away, I believe I had an unfortunate channel of my crystal ball and lost my MP. I had blasted him until I ran out the next time and then I killed him the third round.   Antaeus caused me to haste away and heal as well, but I think the rest weren't too bad overall. I was really scared in Tartarus since I didn't have any rNeg unless I was in lich form, so I picked up Summon Butterflies for that since Dispel Undead is line targeted, those little guys helped a ton then!  So yeah, when I needed to kite around I found that Haste+cBlink were enough to get away when I needed it, but in general the enemies seemed to blow up in a couple of casts.  Haha don't worry about the conflicting thing - I remember that too. They took it out in .15 I think, I remember being upset at the time since I thought it was cool that they interacted that way though I certainly prefer being able to be a fire and ice mage!"
dcss,3aonkn,ManipulativeOrg,3,Mon Jun 22 06:19:11 2015 UTC,"The short sword of speed is (much) better, but both are fairly terrible at fighting armored opponents. Train short blades to around min-delay, but keep in mind that vs high AC opponents (orc warriors, goliath beetles, etc), your best bet will be to run away and shoot poison needles.  The speed enchantment gives +50% damage output by making you attack 50% faster. Piercing gives ~16%?  In the short term, the enchantment bonus of a weapon (+1 vs +2) means very little compared to the weapon type. Daggers do better stab damage, short shorts are (slightly) better vs armor.  There is a combat simulator called FSIM which can parse thousands of simulated attacks, but this is a level of detail which is usually unnecessary..."

Mid game summoning evocables are really useful for getting hydra off of your back and causing distraction stabs. Rods help out with straight direct damage available when you need it.

No, you should not start going for tornado, that will lead to getting one-shotted by stone giants. You need to balance offense/defense, and training air right now for tornado would mean you'd have to rely on airstrike, which is not great against non-flying thing. I'd go with fireball, and then see what Veh deigns to give.  If I may make a suggestion: how about you turn on dodging at 25% and never turn it of? That should give you acceptable defense. If you go fireball, singing sword is an option; this will also allow you a buckler, which will also be of value.   Lastly, if your DEs dont work out, try a Dr blaster sometime.

Just keep it as something to do if you have a lot of XP floating around.  Staves is a fine weapon. You'll eventually want to train it to 14 for almost quick blade level speed.  At this point though, I would have my skills much more focused. I'd be aiming for another pip of power on your fire magic spells, and then more defenses. Then quarterstaff after that.

I forgot I had invocations for like 20ish minutes so that's why that is so high, made for some powerful and guaranteed Qaz explosions though.

You seem to have a lot of exp invested in earth magic, and I'm not sure LRD and passwall are worth it. Also, a lot of points invested in throwing. Invest more in dodging and armour to shore up your defenses (and keep fighting high, since Gr have low base health), and look to see if you missed any source of rF before poking your head into Elf or Vault. You can probably give up one of the MR rings to accommodate rF (1 pip of rF is better than the 4th pip of MR). I'm also not sure making use of Fangs 1 is superior to the defenses of a helmet."
dcss,3aircy,Ztang,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:56:00 2015 UTC,Thanks. Sound advice. Sadly the dungeon is barren of any rF. I've been waiting for it. That level of MR was pretty useful against the Orb Spiders. The only rF I have is that single resistance potion :S  Fang 1 doesn't block the helmet slot. I got it from a beneficial mutation but haven't notice if it is seeing some use.  Elven halls it is… I'll try and be extra careful.
dcss,3aircy,Quazifuji,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"Elven Halls is entirely optional, and many people would recommend skipping it entirely for your first win.  If you do go for it, I highly recommend the kill hole strategy: dig a little zig-zag passage using disintegration and possibly digging just outside the vault (as close to the vault as you can find destructible walls) so that when you stand at the back of the passage, only the tile right next to you is visible.  Then very carefully lure the elves back to that hole so you can fight them one at a time in melee, without giving them time to blast you at range or swarm you.  It's still dangerous, but if you can pull this strategy off successfully it becomes much less dangerous than normal.  Also, be extra careful with sorcerers and high priests - they use hellfire, which ignores all defenses and is thus particularly dangerous for gargoyles (normally your crazy AC as a gargoyle more than makes up for your low HP, but hellfire is an exception)."

dcss,3aecq3,Slogo,3,Fri Jun 19 13:53:18 2015 UTC,Hatches exist in any vault where you may get stuck. It's basically there so if you randomly (or not randomly) teleport into it you can get out. It's part of the vault blueprint basically.  You'll see the same on islands surrounded by deep water/lava or other disconnected vaults (except the slime pits vault iirc).

It's not about stealth or stabbing, you could do those just as easily from a lot of other classes. Sure maybe an artificer or gladiator doesn't start with stealth, but it's trivial to get the first 4-5 points of stealth generally anyways.  No, for assassin it's all about the blowgun. It's the one defining thing that makes As not just ""a gladiator with points in stealth"".  So make sure to be taking good advantage of your blowgun through the early and mid game."

dcss,3abyod,triorph,5,Fri Jun 19 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, SpAs is a meleedude fighter with a guaranteed blowgun.  So one thing that's worth noting is that if you want to meleedudes, you shouldn't be using a dagger. Heck its advisable not to use short blades at all, but if you are you should be using a rapier or a quickblade. Other good weapons are lajatangs, demon blades, double swords, demon whips, eveningstars, or most fast weapons with an elec brand.  Spriggan is considered by many to be one of the strongest races in the game, but that's not because of their ability to straight up beat dudes in a fight, but rather their intrinsic movement speed, meaning they can straight up run away from any situation that's immediately bad. This means an important part of being a spriggan is recognising when a situation is bad and preemptively running away.  If you really want to play a stabber fighting style, rather than a meleedude style, then you basically need to start as an enchanter. You said you don't want this, which is fine, but if so it means you're resigned to either worshipping the RNG for a hexes book and/or becoming more meleedude oriented than a typical stabber would be."

Makhleb is also a fairly common pickup due to his heal passive. Vehumet and Sif also work for casters.  I think the determining factor of a characters ability to do extended boils down to torment resistance, or the ability to avoid/kill stuff that torments before getting tormented. I like to go trog -> Dith, because dith's shadowform gives torment resistance and immunity to a lot of annoying stuff, and also Dith's playstyle overall does really well in Hell/Pan - ""run past everything"".   You could also consider Ashe due to her skill boosts/retraining. Statue form gives respectable torment resistance and Ashe could allow some characters who couldn't normally learn it divert enough experience into earth/TM.  I just did a 15 rune run recently with an Ogre of Gozag, and was even able to clear a zig just because I had statue form to counter torment. Gozags abilities are also still super good in late game, supplying you with a constant stream of gold even on corpseless monsters, and allowing you to haste, might, heal, resist, etc quite often.  I've heard of people doing 15 rune runs with Qazlal but I always found his invocations too unwieldy and piety intensive to be reliable enough to kill threats quickly in extended, and he doesn't provide rTorm and makes an asston of noise.  Kiku is also a possible option as he gives you ready access to Lichform which is a good spell for extended."

It's sort a limited set in the sense that if you're switching a god specifically at the end-game point Zin & TSO are going to be your strongest options because they build piety reasonably fast and offer important benefits targeted at the end game.  The other main option would be Jivya.  Otherwise any god that's happy with you just killing dudes is probably fine to switch to, but there's not a strong pull to take any of them really so you'd do it more just to do it over anything else.

dcss,3a9ihy,pereza0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:37:58 2015 UTC,"My very first win was with a VsSu of Zin, went 15 runes and still had the ""hero"" mindset so I didn't run from anything and managed to kill all the hell/pan lords etc. Here's a dump: http://dobrazupa.org/morgue/herbaltea/morgue-herbaltea-20150418-063723.txt   Tbh I think you're overthinking it a bit, I summoned throughout the entire game and never felt the xp penalty to be particularly burdensome. I was easily able to hit L27 and ended up with skills around level 20 in quite a few schools by the time I finished.   As others have said, it's generally a really bad idea to expect a single skill or school to be able to carry you through the entire game. As you play through the game you're going to find yourself in situations where straight summon spam is far from the ideal way to get through, and diversifying your character will give you a lot more utility and options.   Pretty much every character (except maybe a straight conjurer) will at least want enough skill to hit mindelay with their chosen weapon. Other schools that particularly lend a large amount of utility and are worth branching into are Charms (haste, repel/deflect missiles, regeneration) Necromancy (regeneration, animate dead and various other minion spells, every spell in necronomicon) and Translocations (apportation, blink, phase shift, passage of golubria, dispersal).   If you are having trouble as a summoner in the early game, I would recommend trying a Vine Stalker. Imo they have incredible synergy  with summoning, as you can summon spam until you are low on mp, melee a bit to recharge your mp bar, summon more, repeat. The intrinsic spirit shield also makes them a lot more durable than they seem at first glance. Call imp is a good spell early game, you can have up to 3 of them out and everything but the red imp will do respectable damage in the early game. Guardian golem will make your other summons last longer, and can do huge damage (and block!) when it overheats and explodes, but DO NOT stand next to it. Lightning spire will remain useful throughout the game as it's basically a free nuke every couple of turns, and it is capable of mowing down multiple enemies when placed in a corridor, even into vaults and zot.   Anyway, I played a lot of TOME before I started playing dcss, and you really do need a different mindset to be successful in each game. TOME forces and rewards specialization, but dcss does not, and you really need to adapt to what you find in the dungeon and diversify your skills to be successful."

dcss,3aa2we,Ztang,2,Thu Jun 18 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"Get singularity <3% fail by training only tLoc and shields to 4. Then focus on your defenses and get your EV to something decent (25ish would be good) while also padding out your hp (you should aim for 175 at least)  You need to work on getting rN+++ or at least rN++ or you'll be torn apart by torment.  Ditch the amulet of faith asap. You hardly spend piety with Sif so it's doing nothing right now and you'll need the slot for resistances. While you're in an area that's relatively tame you want to be able to rebuild your piety.  rMutation would be ideal for your amulet slot. With the clarity mutation you REALLY don't want to risk getting a bad mutation that you have to purge off (or losing it to a malmutate). You can manage the depths and even Crypts without it, but it'd be safest to have it and in general what you want for amulet.  EDIT:  93828 | Vaults:5 | Identified the +0 pair of gloves of Starshine {rF++ rN+ Str+2 Int-2} (You found it on level 5 of the Vaults)  Use these imo. -2 int is nothing when you have 40+ int and 3 levels of useful resistances is pretty good. I know it puts you over the top for rF+, but later on you will be able to juggle gear around and you may end up replacing the 4th rank of rF+ (your ring or your robe) with something else.

I have ascended twice with the orb of Zot, both times with three runes only, once on a Spriggan Enchanter who killed with passwall and stabbing and once with a Gargoyle of Okawaru who killed things by hitting them very hard.  This is my most successful and most promising caster. I started DE because I wanted a straightforward, powerful magic user. I chose Sif Muna in order to have as many spells available to me as possible and in order to make use of Channel Energy, which makes longer fights possible even while slinging out mana-hungry spells.  I feel very powerful, so I am reluctant to grab the orb now after three runes and ascend. I'd like to go into the extended game, but I'm not sure how to do it. I know that the extended game makes a three-rune run look like a mini-game.  I hope someone responds to my post before death finds me in the Depths. Again, thank you for taking a look!

dcss,3a6sac,Arithrix,3,Wed Jun 17 17:54:41 2015 UTC,You're in pretty good shape.  Focus on fighting for hp to give yourself a better buffer if things go bad. Stop training other things to get fighting up. I'd say you want at least another 25 hp.  Enchant the eveningstar and it will become better than the demonwhip against high AC targets.  You can probably find something else for armor (like Gold Dragon Armor) if you want since you EV is crap anyways.  Ditch the amulet of faith (wearing it to this point was a good move) and use Elf 1 & 2 to gain back your piety. You'll want the resist Mutation for orbs of fire.  If you get fighting up with time/room to spare then get evocations up more as well so you can zap Orbs of Fire or use evocables effectively in emergencies. Upheaval is subpar vs Orbs of Fire because of the Orb of Fire's resistances.  If you don't have any armor to switch to or want to switch then use all of your enchant armor scrolls.
dcss,3a6sac,Slogo,2,Wed Jun 17 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"Great advice, with one exception: I can imagine literally a single situation where zapping an orb of fire with a wand is a good idea, if one has Evo>25 and still then probably only if one is a formicid caught without fog in one of the lungs.  With a good evening star, rf++ and >50 AC the OoFs should be alright, if OP is playing careful enough."

dcss,3a6sac,Slogo,2,Wed Jun 17 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"You're in pretty good shape.  The biggest issue if that you should stop training Maces and Flails skill - you've got enough for min delay on both your weapons, after that point you'll benefit more from other things.  That demon whip is one of the best weapons imaginable for a character with good necromancy skill.  You have no necromancy skill, however, which means the pain brand does literally nothing for you right now.  It's still not a bad weapon, but the eveningstar will do more damage if you enchant it, especially against high-AC enemies.  You'd want to find a different way to cover up your cold weakness or remove the fire ring, though - having an elemental weakness is a very bad idea.  Overall, though, you're in solid shape.  The Depths will get you a ton of XP (I generally do them before Vaults 5, actually) and might improve your loot options.  You can do Elf and Crypt if you want, although they might be as likely to kill you as to improve your chances of winning, so if you do them do them with caution (especially Elf 3, which kills quite a few people their first time there)."
dcss,3a6sac,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"Would it be advisable to start training Necromancy just to take advantage of that pain brand?

dcss,3a6sac,Quazifuji,2,Wed Jun 17 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"It's normally not worth training necro just for a pain brand, but a for a +8 demon whip that also has nice resists it might be worth grabbing 5 or 10 points.  You might still be better off just finding another way to cover up the cold weakness (a shield or plate armour of rF, or a gold dragon armour, would do just fine) and using the eveningstar, especially if you have a lot of enchant scrolls, but I'm not sure.  Either option is strong enough to win, I think, a better player might be able to tell you if one is more likely than the other.    But I think it's probably worth grabbing at least a little bit of necromancy skill if you decide to stick with the demon whip.  Not much, but you could get 5-10 skill really quickly in the depths.  Are there any nice spells you can grab in the process?  Animate Skeleton doesn't really work with Qazlal, but regeneration's always useful."

dcss,3a6sac,jnmwhg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Ordinarily I'd recommend charms over necro, but I think if someone's using a pain weapon in Depths anyway the damage bonus from 5-10 necro skill is probably worth the relatively small experience it would take to get it.  It's usually not worth using a pain weapon if you're not using necro anyway, but if any weapon could be strong enough to be an exception that one would probably qualify, especially combined with a really good ring of fire."
dcss,3a4e7b,Dusty_Old_Fart,3,Wed Jun 17 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"Just in case you don't know: when a vampire is thirsty and stabs a living foe, they heal for a ton of HP. This makes staying in the Thirsty or lower range a lot more appealing, for the resistances and stab healing (slow regen doesn't matter with stab heals). Although, use your judgement as appropriate.  Late game hexes don't lose their usefulness, although they wont be usable on quite a few enemies. If you find Invisibility, you'll be glad you invested in hexes.  The quickblade will do considerably more damage than the rapier because of it's speed, and antimagic is a useful brand against anything that can recite a spell.  Skills: stop training Ice magic. Now train stealth to at least 15 (you have a +5 aptitude in that, abuse it!), dodging to 15 (if not higher, more evasion is better), and fighting to 15 (more HP is really important if you don't want to get caught off guard. You can't 100% rely on AC or EV, but your HP is always there.)"

dcss,3a4e7b,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"For simulacrum, you should train ice and necro equally, since it benefits from both.  And since you're probably going to want a pain weapon eventually, and request corpses scales with necromancy, your character will probably benefit more overall from Necro.  But you also don't need to get Simulacrum online this early, because nearly everything should still be stabbable at the moment.  Right now I'd probably get more stealth, dodging, and fighting, then go for simulacrum later.  Also, since Simulacrum is often cast out of combat, it doesn't need to be super reliable - you can probably use it a bit around 14% failure anyway.   Gear has been pretty lackluster at this point, should I be going to Orc now to visit shops   Going to Orc after Lair is almost always a good idea.  If you're lucky, you'll find a pain weapon or a non-artefact quickblade there to pain brand, which will be awesome.  If you don't find either soon, I'd strongly consider pain branding a rapier - it's the second best short blade to pain brand, and quick blades are very rare and it's generally not worth holding out hoping for one unless you have a comparable weapon anyway (right now a rapier of pain is better than anything you have).   What sort of armor/level should I be ultimately shooting for?   Something light, obviously.  Heavy armour besides Shadow Dragon will hurt your stealth too much, and with such low strength Shadow Dragon will probably hurt your EV too much.  I'd say generally just wear the heaviest armour you can that keeps your spells success rates and stealth at a good level.  Leather's fine, it'll probably be nice to eventually transition to one of the lighter dragon armours (maybe mottled or steam, Quicksilver if you're lucky, possibly Fire/Ice/Pearl but those are a bit heavy for your strength).  You don't really need to plan ahead for armour, though (outside of deciding when to spend enchant scrolls).  Just see what you find."

I made those choices because I have a staff of energy and stupidly overpowered spells for the midgame, so I wanted the extra mana from the helm more than I cared about the (substantial) drawbacks. The chainmail has just been a placeholder in the early game till I find something better (I did - fire dragon armor). IMO the helmet is less of an issue than chainmail - it helps me have enough mana that nothing ever gets into melee range anyway so the -1 AC is moot.   Now that I'm past the ""natural"" branches where no MR isn't a huge problem and heading into Elven I'm dumping the chainmail, and I'll dump the helm for Elf:3 as well.

It seems natural to me to make sure you are fully using those advantages as gargoyles have pretty low HP and bad EV. Gargoyles are the perfect race to build a caster that can use a rather heavy armour.   I would personally keep the chain mail and look for a better dragon armour and invest a lot more points in the armour skill.

I trained staves, and exchanged some hits against a rakshasa. He used phantom mirror, and killed me.  I guess the Majin-Bo is really not that powerful.

You probably won't need to ever change out of those robes, particularly on a gargoyle, unless you run into Pearl Dragon Armor or something. Feel free to experiment with the lighter dragon armors if you start feeling like you're lacking defenses.   With the robe, you can safely turn off spell skills for while. I'd suggest picking up some stealth, which is generally useful and you have a great aptitude for it. You should also think about picking a melee skill to deal with popcorn. Staff is a great choice for an eventual staff of earth, but maces are also good if you've found anything good. The hand axe is not a good enough base weapon to affect your decision here.  You should learn Summon Butterflies and Animate Dead. The former is always a great utility spell, and with Robes of the Archmagi the latter is very cheap to get online relative to its usefulness. EDIT: Actually, Archmagi doesn't give +Wiz. I think Animate Dead is still a solid pick.  Go ahead and scroll ID that potion, and at this point those scrolls and the wand of digging too."

dcss,39tkh5,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"This comes from the perspective of a Cheibriados worshipping Naga Transmuter. Some may carry over to more general Transmuter play, some may not.  Use Spider Form liberally for movement (ie before you go up or down stairs, to close to melee, etc), but keep in mind it reduces your armor to basically zero. Use repel missiles before spiderform if you need it.  I never have really tried using Ice Form.  Blade Hands is your offensive powerhouse. You say don't use it against Hydra, but I've never really had a problem. You'll kill the hydra in 2-3 rounds, the extra heads aren't going to matter. You'll kill basically everything you can touch effortlessly, the trick is getting there without dying.  Start training Armor when you except to be finding Dragon Armor. Dodge isn't as useful as it is for a lot of other characters, since you're large, but its amplified while you're in Spider Form and its all you really have before Dragon Armor so get it to a halfway decent level.  You could try other strategies (statue form, dragon form, etc), but they all meld your armor and let you use a shield, so it would really be a totally different strategy and build. Making a hybrid of the two that can switch between defensive forms and Blade Hands would be interesting but it feels like you're spreading yourself pretty thin."
dcss,39tkh5,damienreave,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"I never have really tried using Ice Form.   Ice Form is an amazing skill for the early game, specifically for Lair. I really love it and it allows you, no matter what race you are, to destroy Lair, and build up your character to the point when you can use Blade Hands successfully.   Poison resistance helps you to survive against the most dangerous enemies - black mambas, killer bees. If you're a fragile race, you really need poison resistance. Bonus AC makes you much more bulky. It gives you around 5-7 AC at the point you enter Lair (in case you rushed Ice Form) and this is more than enough to negate most of the danger in this location. Freezing branded UC is particularly useful against cold-blooded enemies, and Lair has many of those. Other than that, just like Freezing on weapons, it increases your damage. Since there are very few enemies that are resistant to cold, it gives you an edge Max hp increase is a very cool bonus especially for fragile races   However, it also has its cons, but most of them will not be exposed in Lair.   rF- can make it harder to defeat fire drakes and maybe some uniques Inability to use wands can be frustrating, especially if you were lucky to find haste/healing/tp All armour except rings and amulets is melded, this can be frustrating if you were lucky to find a helpful artifact   Other than that, the bonuses to HP and AC make it much easier to go through Orcs as well. Especially if you were lucky to find a rF+ ring to negate the rF- ice form gives you."
dcss,39tkh5,_ohyou,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"Some things that are worth pointing out for ice form:   If you only train transmutations, blade hands will be castable before ice form. The bonus AC is useful, but if you already have AC (wearing enchanted ring mail for example) you may end up with less AC than blade hands.   So whether or not to cast ice form depends mostly on your rPois (why Nagas might skip it), the bonus HP, AC if you don't have any (Felid, Octopode, Draconian), and freeze attacks on slowable enemies. In addition, you're going to be training a skill that you might not use for anything else if you want to cast it before blade hands.  That said, ice magic is a very nice skill, especially if you're able to get Ozocobu's Armour. This is already a very strong spell, and its even stronger when cast from ice form."

Ice Form is a decent mix of offense and defense. You can use it vs Hydras (where blade hands isn't available) or as a way to get Poison resistance. It's also useful vs some monsters with cold attack.  Blade Hands is your go to form for the mid-game as it's an immense amount of offense. You're relying on your own defenses though, so dodging (and possibly armor) is of the utmost importance. Once you get blade hands you'll only use spider for movement and ice form vs things like hydras or sources of cold damage.  Late game either you transition to dragon armor and at some point possibly give up blade hands in favor of a shield + gloves (for resistances) or you go to statue form which is a bit like blade hands + a huge defensive boost, but it has some quirks and drawbacks to deal with.  But roughly yes, once you get blade hands the other forms are situational."
dcss,39t6q1,TheSilverSpiral,4,Sun Jun 14 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a higher emphasis on unarmed combat, first off.

It's good to use rPois in Lair. Rings of str are good too.  Tactics wise, you should always lurk by the stairs at first. If something is big and scary, run. If it gets next to you, blink or teleport and heal up. Use wands or throwables on big stuff so it's softened by the time it hits you.   Hydras are tough. I would run from them at first, or kill them with wands."

dcss,39t6q1,Slogo,3,Mon Jun 15 07:16:00 2015 UTC,"My general rule of thumb is if you are going to melee as an EV character you usually want ~16-20EV by early lair (depending in part on your AC). It's not really enough defenses to take on Hydras, but it should be enough for most generic stuff.  Skip the Evocations until later (mid-lair maybe) in my opinion unless you get something really good. Even then you may want to delay it more. You need to be strong enough to handle anything but the strongest monsters so you aren't constantly spending piety & consumables just to clear stuff. Once you have that foundation you can grab evocations to help you take out tough things like hydras.  I don't know exactly what #s you want for UC early, but my personal guide has to been to treat it as a weapon. If I were going around as a melee dude I'd expect min-delay on my weapon at that point to be 14 or 16 skill so that's what I'd shoot for (if you are tm or something you probably cut UC back to like 12/14 by that point since you get a ton of dmg from your spells).  Yellow should be good for your build. At level 14 you'll get an additional bite attack which should help a lot with your damage output. Also the breath is good if you're punching things since you can corrode their defenses a bit.  Spells I'd say come in steps. Get rMissile before going into shoals or snake pit (if you have them). Swiftness and Regen are also nice to pick up early-ish, but other than those simple charm spells I'd mostly wait to start mixing in higher level spells until you have a good UC skill (16+) and high EV (25+)."

After awhile, you'll often find yourself swapping it out for an alternative to shore up any deficits in your resistances   rPois vs. MR   Yes, it's a good decision to have rPois for Lair. MR overall is very important, though, and you'll need to swap rPois out for the MR if you run into any Uniques/monsters capable of banishment   Is Okawaru a good choice, and when should I use Heroism and Finesse?   Yes. Okawaru is a strong choice, both for his gifts and for his abilities. Heroism and Finesse can help you deal with tough enemies, and depending on how tough the enemy is (and the fail rate on Finesse), you may want to pop just Heroism or both.   How do I deal with Hydras?   Give them a wide berth until you've finished everything else in Lair (and maybe done most/all of Orc), then go back and show them what-for. Whittle them down at range (thrown items, evocables, etc.) and then smash their jaws in.   Should I have used [Ring of Teleport] more?   Hard to say, but I rarely use Ring of Teleport.

In principle you could get a Bailey on top of those, but they seem to be rare in 0.16 (at least for me). Basically lots of Volcano layouts are relatively small and fast, so long as you don't get banished by a stray Ogre Mage, and Ice Cave layouts are almost always slow and long, especially if you try to clear every enemy, so you have to tackle them in that order. You can also get a Bazaar combined with any of those or a Wizlab, but Bazaars are fast to clear.  Bear in mind, timed portals really have two separate timers. The main, fast one triggers when you find a level with a portal on it, and counts down so long as you're on that level. There's also a separate slower one that starts if you leave the level, and that's the one that's counting down when you're inside another timed portal. It really is doable.  That's really beside the point, though.  Managing to clear two or three timed portals on one level is a fun achievement, and that's what's important. Taking it away won't give much benefit to those who can't yet manage it, but it will harm those who like to try, whether or not they succeed."

Unless it's very early in the game, I always just burn a scroll of magic mapping rather than try to guess.  There's one kind of spoilery consideration that affects this a little bit, namely that some portal entrance vaults have to be placed at the edges of the map, and will never show up in the middle. It's most noticeable for Sewer entrances - they're much more likely to be at the edge of the map than anywhere in the middle, and they're common enough for it to be something you keep in mind. Apart from that, just use magic mapping and make a beeline to the portal, you should almost always have time."

Combined with the noise and miss chance, this makes it unwise to spam in Lair unless you're near stairs.  That being said, air magic has a lot of insanely strong spells for the midgame if you can find them (Clouds, Deflect, Ball Lightning, Silence) and one of the best lategame transitions among mage backgrounds. Therefore, I think it's important to follow a god who gifts spells. Vehumet is likely to gift you a Cloud spell or some good lv5 Conjurations around Lair:6, and you can skill heavily into Conjurations to have more variety.  If you're having trouble in the early game, I would suggest picking a sturdier species and focusing more on your weapon skill and defenses, ignoring Lightning Bolt completely until after Lair, only training up your magic schools when you find something particularly powerful. This is also pretty applicable advice for any mage, not just AE. Play like a hybrid until you find your key spells."

Lightning bolt should be always used either for a dual zap, or to hit multiple enemies. Unlike other bolt spells, each enemy that gets hit doesn't ""consume"" a tile of the bolt. Meaning that you could hit 6-7 enemies in a long corridor. Also try to use it near upwards stairs, as the noise will almost always bring more enemies to you.  What is your god choice? If it's vehumet, you have a high chance of being gifted battlesphere (use it!) and airstrike (excellent vs high ev, low ac targets since it always hits). Your go to spell should be freezing cloud, if you get it from gift or spellbook.  And remember, as a tengu, you are limited to just EV for defence - your ac and hp are gimped for a quite large portion of the game. Be cautious, retreat often."

For winners, add 254000 + 2000 * runes + 6250000000 * runes^2/turns. Modified xp = 0.7 * xp up to 250,000 + 0.4 * xp between 250,000 and 1M + 0.2 * xp between 1M and 3M + 0.1 * xp above 3M. For an XL27 character, this works out to roughly 0.5M + XP/10. Note that there is an XP cap of 9M (but not in 0.16). As of 0.9, inventory value no longer contributes towards your score. This doesn't matter.     Your score (as a winner) is divided by the number of turns you take. Hence, taking more turns is actively bad for your score. Also, as it notes, your items don't count towards score. The obvious conclusion IMO is that doing zigs is generally bad for score (time consuming, don't add significant XP)."

ANY character can eventually clear a ziggurat with the correct items, gear, skill build and god, which can be eventually attained by scumming pan or abyss, so it makes sense that ziggurats have very little effect on score."

dcss,39n5rn,Megika,2,Sat Jun 13 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"Excellent response. I'm going to respond to the question in respect to my specific build, Tengu Fighter. It comes down to a couple of important things.  Weakness of Tengu's: Low Health Restricted Helmet Restricted Boots  Strengths: High damage High aptitudes.  Usually, fighter backgrounds initially unequip their shields because it is too cumbersome at a low skill level. However, because tengus have high base damage due to their talons, beak, and claws, I was able to balance out my shield encumbrance with my sheer damage, and balance out my low hp with a high SH.  Second, I worship trog. Trog gives you berserk, which dramatically increases max hp in a fight. His allies are also really good.  Third, using my high aptitudes for shield, armor, dodging, and fighting, I was able to get my hp to an alright level. Then, I raised my AC, EV, and SH all to 27. While not actually the maximum, still very good.  In conclusion, Crawl is a game all about balance. Too tanky and no damage is no good, all damage and no defense is also bad."

If you can get 16+ Invocations you can take out a lot of things with Upheaval. 16-20 invo would probably be enough to nuke down a hellion since they only have resistance to fire and not a lot of hp.

The difference between 0 and -1 aptitude is not that big and demon blades are not too demanding.  Stealth is a good investment, even if you had not gotten a manual it would not be a bad idea to train it a bit.  At this point I would advise you not to put more points in Int. You already have a lot (and might get more regardless, Gargoyles get Str or Int randomly) and Vehumet helps further.  I would point some points in Dex, and with a bit of dodging see if you can get a bit more EV.  Also, check if there is any Swamp DA around, with that Strength you might be able to wear it without a big penalty (FDA might be a bit too much but dont discard it).

dcss,39hhet,Slogo,2,Thu Jun 11 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Stop training shields (you can already use the buckler and it's unlikely you'll find a shield or large shield that's more worthwhile).  Stop training either air or fire in my opinion. Focus on one to get high level spells on for that school. You already have a castable bolt of fire and fireball which is enough to take out most things and your air magic gives you some off-school spells.  Stop training spellcasting if you can, but that would depend on your current spell hunger and whether or not you are starving. You have plenty of spell levels and old spells you can forget for the time being.  Focus on a single level 8 or 9 spell (that you have available to learn) and head towards that along with rounding out your defenses and getting some weapon skill.  Long blades is a fine choice since demon blade is only 14 skill, but M&F is also good if you can get a demon whip since it is mindelay at 12 (then later you can go back for more skill to use an eveningstar).  Elemental staves are also an option as you develop, but you need more fire magic for that to pay out I think.  Raise your dex as well, maybe 1-2 more in int if you really want, but at 8 dex your EV is going to stay pretty bad."
dcss,39hhet,Slogo,3,Thu Jun 11 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with the vast majority of this advice, especially about stopping shields and not bothering with two elements (yet, at least).  However   Focus on a single level 8 or 9 spell (that you have available to learn) and head towards that along with rounding out your defenses and getting some weapon skill.   You need to be careful with this sort of advice, since a lot of people overrate level 9 spells.  Bolt of fire, fire ball, and airstrike are enough to win the game.  More spellpower with them is lovely,  and firestorm or tornado are awesome if you can get them, but the experience investment to get them online is massive, even with Vehumet.  Some powerful utility spells like haste and/or cBlink will improve your chance of winning way more than Firestorm or Tornado will, for way less experience.  You can do with more conjurations and fire spells, but I would treat level 8 and 9 spells as a luxury that's fun if you have experience to spare, not as a goal.  Key goal should be to get a good array of level 4-7 offensive spells online (basically done  already) at a good spellpower (could maybe use more), then getting a good weapon to min delay and getting good defenses and utility spells.  Only then is it really worth trying to train for level 9 spells.  Tunnel too hard on level 9 spells and you're likely to find yourself dead before you get to use them."
dcss,39hhet,Quazifuji,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah certainly don't over-rush it, but at the same time you firestorm/glaciate is just significantly more mana efficient than something like bolt of fire or fireball in most cases.  Though the advice is more geared towards not spreading yourself too thin. I think it's a lot weaker to have like 15 conjurations, 15 fire magic, 15 air magic than it is to focus on conjuration & fire. Getting utility spells through tLoc and charms are a different matter and usually worthwhile, I didn't mean to suggest otherwise, but with a pure int caster the investment for those spells is usually pretty low (I think you can get haste castable at like 10 charms or so)"

You can do this by training summoning just as well as armor. The big draw of the armor skill would be the easy first 10ish points and the fact that it'd boost your AC which you'd need to make up for the drop in armor.

dcss,395f37,amalloy,2,Tue Jun 9 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"I would have chosen either experience or an eye. Ru piety is very valuable: when you get up to Power Leap you can escape any bad situation, and with Apocalypse you can kill just about anything. Rejecting sacrifices means you spend more time laboring under your existing sacrifices before you start getting the real payoff. Inaccuracy is a pain, and losing a level costs you some hp and mp, but you get a lot for them.   Ru sacrifices are supposed to make your character weaker: if you only take sacrifices that don't matter to you at all, you will take forever to start getting Ru's fabulous benefits. Instead, take the largest sacrifice that doesn't make your character completely non-viable. Eg, don't sac armour if you're a plate-mail kind of guy, don't sac fire on a fire elementalist. But losing some accuracy doesn't ruin your character - if it did, it would ruin every character, and nobody would ever take it. Likewise experience is mostly a temporary setback - if you live through it in the short term, with the help of your new Ru abilities, you can mostly forget about it afterwards."

dcss,395zlx,enarc13,2,Tue Jun 9 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"Standard advice is that if you haven't ever won, content yourself with a 3 rune win to get a victory under your belt. You'll feel more confident going into the next run, even if you're less lucky with item drops. As far as your 3rd rune, I'd recommend Abyss or Vaults. Abyss is pretty easy for melee characters. Alternately, with a couple immolation scrolls and cBlink online, V5 welcoming party should be pretty easy."
dcss,395zlx,Ztang,3,Tue Jun 9 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like with Wyrmbane especially V5 should be really manageable. The welcoming party usually isn't as dangerous as everything that pours in after, but a lot of V5 are dragons which should be easily dispatched.  Otherwise for this run I'd just say focus on nothing but fighting and dodging, with haste and cBlink and the gear at your disposal you have enough tools to clear the game the only real threat is just being bashed around by something which fighting and dodging will take care of."
dcss,395zlx,Slogo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I always forget to use the immolation scrolls when I'm surrounded, didn't even think about it.  I got down to V5, saw what was waiting for me and immediately noped out of there.  I'll check out Abyss maybe."
dcss,395zlx,Quazifuji,3,Thu Jun 11 07:52:57 2015 UTC,"Abyss and Slime are usually the alternatives to Vaults for a third rune.  Slime is incredibly dangerous without rCorr, so definitely one of the other two.  Abyss is more of an endurance test than anything - the individual fights there usually aren't that bad, but it's very hard to rest and you might be in there for a very long time.  There's also mutations occasionally, but you've got rMut.  I think this character could handle Abyss, but my leaning would definitely be Vaults.  Abyss is annoying, and your TSO halo will make it harder to avoid getting into fights there (the ideal strategy for Abyss is to have some stealth and minimize the amount of fighting you do).  For Vaults, this character should be strong enough to take it on.  With rF+++, immolation is a very effective strategy for the welcoming party and the flame clouds help deal with anything attracted by the noise, but it does make quite a lot of noise.  Really, V5 is dangerous for any character no matter what strategy you use, but this character should be tough enough to handle it if you play carefully.  Big things to watch out for, aside from just the usually dangerous monsters, and Vault Wardens and sometimes things with constriction (usually Tentacled Monstrosities), which can stop you from stairdancing.  Otherwise this character's strong enough that a mix of haste, immolation, and stairdancing should be enough to clear the middle, and then you can just methodically handle everything else.   I've never beat the game at all before, should I only attempt a 3 rune run or go for broke?   Which will bother you more: winning but not knowing if you could have done more, or dying knowing that you could have had your first win?  This is the main thing you need to answer.  My leaning is to go for the first win, if in doubt. Your first win will be extremely satisfying even with three runes, and dying knowing you could have had it would be very frustrating.  You'll have chances to go for more in the future, but I'd say get the first win under your belt.  It is very, very easy to die your first time going for more than 3 runes, no matter how strong your character is.  There are a lot of new threats to deal with in extended, and like the rest of the game, you're probably going to make mistakes as you learn how to deal with them, and those mistakes may or may not get you killed.  You're not guaranteed to die your first time in places like Pan, Hell, and Tomb, but you should definitely go into them prepared for that possibility, and if you're not okay with that then you should win instead."
dcss,395zlx,Pblur,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"Vault is your easiest option, though honestly you're rather well prepared for several other runes. With rN+++, rF+++, and rC++ and haste, you can probably take even the Hells. You have a great god choice for late-game, as you will be killing a ton of evil monsters. And that trishula will deal absurd amounts of damage. At the very least I would consider clearing the vestibule, and seeing how that feels. You can always go back up the stairs in Hell, and it drops you immediately in the vestibule, so it's easy to slowly test your ability at. Tartarus would be the easiest one, as draining is the primary attack, and you're entirely immune. Just remember you don't need to kill the bosses; snatching the rune and teleporting away is perfectly reasonable.  Pan is also entirely doable with your kit, but like the abyss isn't exittable on demand. If you want to dabble, just know that you have to get the rune if you end up on one of the special pan-lord levels. It's never going to spawn again. Oh, and play very very carefully on holy levels, leaving as soon as possible.   Used to be Vaults 5 was stair-scummable, but now that they can lock the stairs, it's less so. It's still probably your easiest, most-reliable rune. Your biggest danger is going to come from titans, as your AC is relatively low and airstrike is smite-targetted. You can undoubtedly clear it though with good tactics. Weaken everyone up at the entrance, start killing them. This will make a lot of noise so people come to you. When you start getting worried about the titans, quicksilver dragons, etc. building up on the edges of the fight, teleport. You can use one of the blocks to control LOS and take people out quicker. Shadow and quicksilver dragons will be easy to dispatch.  Finally, for the Abyss I recommend bringing an extra source of regeneration if you have found one. Regen 1 is a bit low to ensure you can heal up between fights. The Shining One aura is really suboptimal for the Abyss (though not qazlal levels of bad.) Other than that you should be fine.  Good luck with whatever you decide! I'd shoot for 7-10 runes probably. Enough to explore the endgame, but without committing to getting them all. If it stretches to 15, that's fine, but feel free to give up on pan runes if they're too hard. And leave tomb for last. If you manage to get 14 runes, you can try it, but it's absurdly hard.  Edit: Consider saving the last floor of Zot till you've gone through more of the endgame as well. The orb chamber is very very hard for most 3-runers. It's one of the reasons I rarely ascend with exactly 3 runes; it's usually easier to snag 5ish of them than to clear the Orb chamber."

I find pan generally easier since there are far fewer Tier-1 demons   You visited Pandemonium 1 time, and saw 43 of its levels.   Though that may explain it. That's quite a lot of pan levels!  For suggestions: You never entered a Zig, which is odd. The first 10-15 levels of a zig are usually easier than anything hell or pan throws at you, doubly so with someone like Zin backing you up and a Gr's torment resistance. It's a great way to stash some extra loot or pick up extra XP."
dcss,393g8z,Slogo,2,Tue Jun 9 00:03:17 2015 UTC,"Really? I find pan generally easier since there are far fewer Tier-1 demons   Well, I burned through way more consumables on the final Pan bosses than in Hell, and had to use Sanctuary far more often. Perhaps my carefulness in Hell (due to low consumables) made it feel easier.   Though that may explain it. That's quite a lot of pan levels!   Is it? I had no idea. Once I got the Demonic Rune, I just ran from portal to portal until I got to each boss level. I took the fastest exit (through the Abyss) to get out once I got all the Pan runes.   You never entered a Zig, which is odd. The first 10-15 levels of a zig are usually easier than anything hell or pan throws at you   I shied away from Ziggs since I've splatted several promising characters in them. One, a caster, my first time doing a Zig: I didn't know to stop after ~10 levels or so; he got to 19 and faced a swarm of Daevas and died. A different run (SpEn iirc) I hadn't found rMut, so I went in planning to check the first 10 levels and then ditch to see if I could scrounge one up; he splatted at Zigg9.  I didn't really find much (any?) new gear from Pan or Hell. I got some sweet rN rings from Crypt to help with Tartarus, but that was about it."
dcss,393g8z,Slogo,3,Tue Jun 9 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"With Ziggs you just sort of need to take it carefully and have a range of consumables. I like having the full deck of evocables (lamp of fire, stone of tremors, floods, etc.) and high/max evocations especially.  Burn them (and other consumables) at the first sign of any difficulty and whatever piety you need then get out. I guess that's sort of standard crawl advice, but it applies tenfold to the zig. If you can clear the level and leave the zig the difficulty will drop dramatically and you can recover whatever it is you spent. The evocables are especially good for just giving you room and power to clear the floor.  I could see not doing a zigg as a stabber though; the only close calll I had early in a zig was a SpAs of Ru. Though when an entire zig level remains sleeping it's like stabber christmas. With a caster if you have firestorm/glaciate online and something to handle silent spectres you're pretty set for the first 10 levels.  I like taking the dungeon one at like 5+ runes at the very least."
dcss,393g8z,amalloy,3,Tue Jun 9 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"The thing about clearing zigs ""until they get dangerous"" is that zig danger is very spiky. You can faceroll a swamp-themed Zig:12, and then get a mummy-themed -cTele Zig:13 that will torment you to within an inch of your life and then smite off the rest, or a floor full of pandemonium lords with firestorm and glaciate...but most of the time you just get an easy slime-themed Zig:13, and think it's safe to continue on to Zig:14.  On a character that doesn't need anything specific to do well in hell and pandemonium, I wouldn't go into a ziggurat at all, just in case of something nasty and surprising turning up. It'll probably be just fine, but the risk is high and the reward is low.  Now, if you desperately need some !cMut or something in order to feel safe in Pandemonium (or Zot, if your goal is a 3-rune game), you can go hunting through the early levels of a ziggurat."
dcss,393g8z,Slogo,3,Tue Jun 9 01:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you certainly need to judge your character's robustness. Mummy floors can be bad, but if you're ok to do tomb you can probably handle a low depth mummy floor."
dcss,391btp,enarc13,3,Mon Jun 8 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"Vault 1-4 and/then elves 1 & 2 are usually your safest bets.  Also tighten up your skilling a bit. You probably don't need Hexes training and you should focus on Charms first and foremost over Fire Magic (get Haste castable then go for Fire magic if you want it). With 17 spell levels available you should stop training spellcasting for now.  If you are sticking to 1 handed polearms you should stop training that as well.  Imo you should focus on training purely charms to get haste online, then dodging & fighting for some better defensive stats."
dcss,391btp,Slogo,3,Mon Jun 8 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"Very strongly agree about tightening up skilling.  Spell schools don't become useful until you can cast the spells you want, so when you're trying to learn a spell you should generally just exclusively train that spell's school to get it online as fast as possible.  Look at the different skills you're training, pick your priorities, and get them to where you want them a few at a time instead of all at once.  Also, spellcasting should probably never be your highest magic skill, and if you mostly kill things with a Trident you barely need it at all.  Spellcasting's main purposes are to reduce spell hunger and give more spell levels, bit spell hunger doesn't really matter unless you really spam spells a lot or are using really high level spells, and this character has plenty of spell levels.  Spellcasting does help a little with spell success rate, but that's only really noticeable if you're trying to get spells from a very large number of schools online.  For a melee guy just looking to add a bit of utility and ranged firepower, focusing on spell schools will be much, much more useful.  This character should probably never put another point into spellcasting for the rest of the game."

Also hoping to find a demon trident at some point to bless with TSO, so I'll stop training polearms.  Definitely trying to get haste up, I'll train that exclusively until it's under 10% fail."

dcss,391btp,Slogo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:28:43 2015 UTC,Banishment is not that dangerous unless you're out of sources of TP. Even then being stealthy or quick will suffice.  All you need to do in the abyss is TP when you get surrounded or encounter something scary and eventually you'll find an exit. At most it'll usually take you 3-5 TP scrolls. Abyss is only really dangerous if you can't handle the easier mobs like Abominations or you are strapped for useful consumables like TP scrolls.
dcss,391btp,Lucifer_Hirsch,2,Mon Jun 8 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"or if you have no rMut, or if you have no rElec and get swarmed by raijus, or if you are unlucky with exits, and dont find one in half an hour, or if you get pinned by a silent spectre in a bad position, if you teleport in the middle of a mob, if you get marked, if you make more noise than you should, if you explore an open field, so on, so on. the abyss is only trivial if you are a beefy melee monster, with a powerful god for support, and lucky with items. otherwise, it's difficulty just swings too much."
dcss,391btp,Slogo,2,Mon Jun 8 19:57:02 2015 UTC,"Most of those things should never happen.  rMut isn't needed; if you see a wretched star without rMut then you TP immediately. None of the mutations are very dangerous when temporarily applied unless you attack with beserkitis or lose the ability to regenerate HP and happen to be low hp.  ""Getting swarmed by raijus"" is also impossible if you're reading TP scrolls when things look dangerous rather than when you're sitting on 25% hp.  Noise, open areas, etc. don't matter except that they may burn another TP scroll earlier than you'd otherwise want to burn one.  A silent spectre pinning you? If you can't kill a single silent spectre by that point in the game well you're in a lot of trouble already. If the silent spectre shows up while you're fighting off hordes of monsters then you aren't really understanding how to run in the abyss to begin with. Even so they're not exactly your typical Abyss encounter."

That usually buys you a fair number of turns, and more if you LoS well, to explore and search for an exit. Most of what you see in the abyss isn't that harmful until you get pinned or trapped otherwise you just outrun them. TP scrolls take longer, but you're not talking about 30 turns or anything ridiculous like that.  I don't know, I know the abyss can be hard to understand at first, but once you play around there a bit (especially when going extended or playing a stabber where the Abyss is often easier than Vault 5) you get the hang of it and it's not so bad."

Cheibriados just makes Naga's existing problem worse, which means you are even more strongly encouraged to play around it. You know you won't be able to run away, so you plan ahead; and you get extra tools to deal with the issues you'd have even without Chei."

dcss,38u5yi,take-off-every-zig,3,Sat Jun 6 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"I played my first game of DCSS after finally ascending in Nethack, after about a decade of playing:  158 Ben the Ducker (level 4, -26/30 HPs)              Began as a High Elf Fighter on Apr 4, 2011.

First 15 Rune Win... 27 months after that (although I had a few games where I made a stupid mistake in extended, and one death with 15 runes on floor 17 of a zig - out of nowhere I was up against a room full of OOF)  7812423 Smashy the Annihilator (level 27, 214/214 HPs)              Began as a Gargoyle Wizard on Sept 6, 2014.

Total games played: just over 1000 over the last 4 years!

A friend of mine was looking through the death stats in a tourney (I think it was 0.14) and came across   blown up by Edmund the water moccasin   Of course we both stared for a moment!  We figured that the player had repeatedly polymorphed Edmund in an attempt to make him less of a threat (y'know, losing all the armour and weapon, becoming something weaker in general...).  He got mutated so much that he became a glowing shapeshifter, at some point taking the form of an orb spider.  He wove an orb of destruction, launched it at the player, and then shapeshifted into a water moccasin.  Upon looking at the morgue file again though, it actually appears that Xom was the source of the polymorphage.  Xom must have smiled broadly that day!"

The current stable version is 16.1, which is the one you downloaded. The current trunk version is 17 - gets new features but might be unbalanced or even unstable.

If you choose ""0.16"", you'll be playing what's released to download for the binary.  There's no ""syncing"" involved. 0.16 is 0.16 and trunk is future (i.e., 0.17). If you really wanted to compile your own code, you can grab the source from the git repo and compile it and play 0.17 locally.  Just be sure to click the version you really want to play when you're on the web. If you want to play released code, play the biggest number (currently, 0.16).

Most air magic has weird AoEs that makes it hard not to hit your own minions, and if you're only using airstrike I think you'd probably get more out of translocations.  Of course, you can also do a HoWr of Beogh who uses portal projectile workout the large rocks already.

Also you would not have 7 pips in stealth, because heavy armour makes more noise than light armour. Three of the four Stlth++++ pips on shadow dragon armour just go towards ""cancelling out"" the extra weight: you'll have just one more pip than you would in a robe.  But, GDA is tough to pull off without losing other abilities: you need a lot of strength, and a lot of armour skill, to really make it worthwhile for most characters, especially if you want to cast any spells. As a berserker, that's less of a problem for you, but it'll still cost some EV.  The good news is, the hides have the same encumbrance rating as actual armour, so you can try them on and see how much EV you lose, before deciding which to enchant. Your resists are so bad that I expect you'll find the GDA worth it, and it'll probably only cost you a few more points of EV than the shadow dragon armour would, with your ogrely strength. Of course, it also only gives you a few more points of armour: the main advantage would be getting some rF+ and rC+, and if you had both already I'd suggest trying out some swamp dragon armour for rPois instead."

dcss,38jpux,Piginabag,3,Thu Jun 4 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Technically, draining is a flat damage brand, sort of.  It's a mix of flat damage, % damage, and the debuff.  But anyway, I agree with what people said.  A vampiric evening star is better than a demon whip of draining, but it's also probably better than anything else you can get by rebranding a demon whip of draining.  The one case where the demon whip could be worth it is against undead or demons, which are immune to vempirism.  In that case,  draining is equally useless, but a good brand (ideally elec, out of the things you ca get from a branding scroll) would be better.  It's probably not worth switching back and forth in most cases because of the hunger, though.  If you're planning to do a 3-runer, maybe rebrand the demon whip in case you get a good weapon to use for Crypt or demon-heavy Depths vaults or something.  If you're planning a 15-runer but not planning to switch to TSO, it might be worth rebranding, but you could also just rebrand your eveningstar after you're done all the non-demon branches."

dcss,38jc2f,skeletonhat,9,Thu Jun 4 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"Don't train armor for leather in my opinion. At least not that much that early with such low EV. The difference between say 15 and 19 AC isn't going to give you leeway to melee anything dangerous, but having a decent EV WOULD give you some chance at avoiding a whole host of things. Both AC and EV are important, but if you're going for light armor and spell casting I think it's more vaulable to have the higher EV first before you worry about AC. Personally if my AC is going to be sub-20 anyways I think I'd rather like 15AC/25EV than 19/19 or whatever.  You had a ton of spell casting, but no focus in offensive firepower. Granted you had fireball castable at a decent power, but I think you could have benefitted more from higher conjurations & fire magic and lower spell casting especially since you had firestorm secured already, but you may have also been ok as-is. Maybe you had things fine, but basically more fireball less wimpy flames.  Also blink was 8% fail which you could have easily gotten down with an investment in translocations for a few points. 8% is pretty much ""Going to fail when you need it"" territory. I'm guessing your evoked blink was even worse so idk why you ever used it at all.  Though mostly your skills seemed fine, but you got into trouble and didn't really do anything. You had potions of haste and scrolls of blinking, fog, and fear which right there gives you a lot of opportunities to escape that you didn't even try to use. Scrolls of blinking would have especially saved you since you could have just burned all 3 to get the hell out of there or to get to a stair case.  It's hard to say what you did, but you really got yourself in the weeds, with all that crap around you. You should have retreated from the situation far before what that log shows or start bringing out the big guns like fireball earlier.  The thing about fireball to understand is it can't be dodged which is huge in terms of mana efficiency and more importantly time efficiency.  It also seems like you were also in the weeds quite a few times before too since you have a spent wand of teleportation and no teleport scrolls. Try to take things slower and on your own terms more so you can save those consumables.  Looking at it more I'd definitely say you tried to train too many things early on. Focus more at the start of the game and try to get key spells up like fireball then start on defense. Most early D things you can handle without them getting a shot in and for the things that you do want some extra defenses for you'd want something like 10 dodging instead of 5 dodging, 5 fighting, and short blades. A more focused start could probably have saved you a lot of consumables."

Unless you feel really confident with an array of great tools at your disposal (as a FE I'd say at least Bolt of Fire + Fireball and some good defenses) you should probably clear 1-3 of each lair branch before taking on the final level. If you had done that you could have had a lot more destructive power or some invocations for mid-battle recharging.  That also explains how you got so surrounded, I forget 4 is the last lair branch level now."

dcss,38dh1w,whoishigh,3,Wed Jun 3 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"I discovered DC:SS maybe a week ago and I can't put it down. This is my best character so far, Dubark the Hill Orc Fighter and Champion of Beogh, and his sizable legion assaulting some filthy hippies. This was definitely a misstep on my part and I'm not sure anyone made it out alive. Most or all of his loyal orcs were slain before Dubark himself was banished to the Abyss by one of the pointy-eared freaks.  Dubark promptly died in the Abyss. Horribly.  Edit: I'm not sure that was even his entire force. He discovered the entrance to the Elven Halls in the Orcish Mines where only a handful of orcs had the cojones to reject Dubark's righteousness. At any rate, I find it really hard to play when I have that many followers. Won't stop me from trying it again, though :D"

dcss,38gkt6,Slogo,2,Thu Jun 4 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"Physical damage isn't really a concept in DCSS, considering the vast majority of elemental damage is also reduced by AC.

dcss,38gkt6,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, I just meant it more of a coincidental thing I guess. Like sandblast, searing ray, stone arrow, IMB, and magic dart struggle against high AC (as in platemail orc warrior/warlord) in my experience while spells like Fireball or Throw Icicle fare a lot better.  I don't know what to call dmg that's only reduced by AC, physical seems right-ish?  Edit... maybe I'm being unfair to Stone Arrow since I never get it with high conjurations and earth magic that early on (as EE I'll mix in transmutations or a higher focus on earth for petrify and as another class I usually don't train earth that early)"
dcss,38gkt6,Slogo,2,Thu Jun 4 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"The reason I make the correction is because it's actually a fairly common mistake for new players to assume that most spells are not reduced by AC.  I've seen players sacrificing large amounts of AC for some extra resists or whatever because they're worried about spellcasters because they didn't know AC would work just fine against fireball.  So I wanted to make the correction to make sure no one got the wrong impression from your comment.   Like sandblast, searing ray, stone arrow, IMB, and magic dart struggle against high AC (as in platemail orc warrior/warlord) in my experience while spells like Fireball or Throw Icicle fare a lot better.   Well, that's just because those spells all do less damage.  They're going to be weaker against anything not immune to fire or ice, and since AC is a flat reduction and not a portion it has a particularly noticeable effect on lower damage hits.  The exception is earth spells, which often are affected more strongly by AC than other conjurations to make up for the fact that they usually can't be resisted."

dcss,38cesa,jestert79,5,Wed Jun 3 08:57:23 2015 UTC,"Any general stealth tips? It's great much of the time - it felt so good to step into Mara's shadow and one-shot him. But now in Vault I stab 1-2 enemies, then everyone knows where I am and I can't stab anyone, so I just melee everyone. Then someone gets a lucky hit with a great mace and I'm down to half health.   You can't really play a pure stealth stabber, because, as you've found, you can't rely on stealth.  You've been using nets, but you can also use needles or hexes to make enemies stabbable (hexes are the more reliable method if you're not worshiping Trog, which is why Enchanters are actually considered the definitive stealth class - many people consider assassins more of just a melee class with a blowgun than a stealth class, actually).  Even then, there are cases where you can't rely on stabbing, so you just need a backup plan.  This is where a Spriggan of Dith with a vampiric quick blade has trouble.  When you're playing a stabber, you need to be prepared to deal with enemies that you can't stab late game.  Since the character's already dead, my advice, if you want to try a stabber again in the future, is this: don't worship Dith.  It's not that he's bad, it's that he doesn't help a stabber kill enemies they can't stab.  Shadow Mimic doesn't really give a big enough damage boost to short blades to make you good at manfighting enemies, and the rest of Dith's abilities mostly just give utility or make you better at stabbing.  He's a very strong god, but he's actually easiest to use as a non-stabber.  Playing a Spriggan stabber of Dith is tricky because you need to find a backup plan.  The best god for giving a stabber a backup plan is probably Kiku.  The pain brand goes amazingly well with short blades and makes them a solid weapon for just straight up killing things when stabbing fails as long as you're not fighting undead or demons (but undead can be killed easily with dispel undead), and having an army of zombies or simulacra also is a great backup plan and allows for occasional distraction stabs.  Nemelex is also a good choice if you want some extra utility."

While you do always need a backup plan to stealth-based stabbing, I found Shadow Form and Shadow Step (for mobility) were amazing for rune snatching etc. Tomb is hell, but hey! Tomb is always hell.

dcss,38cesa,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"I would completely agree with you. But... that means the advice he needs is to not kill things, rather than make choices which will make him more likely to die in favor of enabling his fighter-mode instincts.  Roguelikes really don't reward high-risk high-reward. And I feel like recommending Kiku, Vehumet, Okawaru, etc. over Dith or Ash (Or Fedhas, if you want to just make sure you win the early game and play mostly godless after that) is helping people play high-risk strategies 'better'."
dcss,38cesa,Pblur,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"That is a valid point.  Although I wouldn't say choosing Kiku makes him more likely to die - Kiku is an amazing late game god, not just a good early game god.  Personally, I struggled in late game the one time I got a SpEn of Dith to Depths, but have won a VpEn of Kiku, so I gave advice based on my personal experience, and I have also seen much better players than myself recommend Kiku over Dith for enchanters.  But than doesn't mean it's the only way to go."
dcss,38cesa,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"OK, I'm interested. I never ran Kiku on a stabber. I know you'll get plenty of meat shields + torment resistance, and guaranteed diversification into Necromancy.  But what do you do with Necromancy? Excruciating Wounds (or pain brand) is clearly useful for a 3-runer. Dispel undead is situationally good for killing things that would be hard to sleep/confuse. You also have regeneration for the Abyss.  That still leaves you hell and pan though. Pain and dispel undead are of limited utility. Do you rely on distracted stabs to kill them? Or let your horde draw them off from the path you need to go and sneak it? Certainly torment resistance will help, but it was always hellfire which was the biggest problem for me on a Sp late-game. Which your meat shields and Kiku won't really help with.  Or do you use simulacrum or haunt or some such high-level spell to be able to kill things? It seems to me that they'd be pretty food-intensive for a spriggan..."
dcss,38cesa,Pblur,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"I only did 3 runes with my VpEn of Kiku, but I have won a 15-runer as a Kiki worshiper.  Request corpses regularly gives dragons, giants, hydras, etc.  I've killed every Pan and Hell lord except Cerebov and Lom Lobon (didn't try those, just cTele ninja'd their runes) by just casting request corpses a bunch then making a stupidly huge army of simulacra.  Ereshkigal died off screen before I even saw her.  Antaeus took a while but died eventually.  Asmodeus looked like things wouldn't work out until the titan simulacra at the back of my army arrive and did 3/4 of his health in about 3 turns to kill him.  Request corpses might be one of the most underrated abilities in the game.  Aside from that, torment protection and mummy curse protection are quite useful in extended, and especially Tomb.  Admittedly, when I did Tomb as a Kiku worshipper, it was back when simulacrum cast from chunks (which made it better when stairdancing), minions could absorb mummy curses, and the new enemies with control undead hadn't been added, those would all make it harder, but he's still quite useful in Tomb.  Overall, my experience with Kiku in extended made me feel like he's one of the strongest extended gods, right up there with TSO and Zin, as long as you have high necro skill and make good use of the request corpses/simulacrum combo.  Also, you completely ignored the pain brand, which is mostly useless in extended but the highest damage brand you can get, especially on a short blade, for the vast majority of a 3 rune game.  It helps a stabber kill a lot of things in depths that they'd normally have trouble with."
dcss,38cesa,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"I did talk about both the pain brand and Excruciating wounds... ;) I was just trying to figure out how Kiku worked with a sneaky character. I guess for a Vamp, you wouldn't have to worry about hunger really, and could just burn through the high level necromancy spells.  Do necrominions still attack offscreen? I know summoners were nerfed a bit a while back so they only attack while onscreen. My first 15-runer was a cheesy DESu before they did that. It basically boiled down to spam summon spells, back up."
dcss,38cesa,Pblur,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Necro minions do still attack offscreen, or at least did last time I played a necromancer, but that's not hugely important most of the time (other than the novelty of killing Ereshkigal without seeing her).  But yeah, Kiku doesn't specifically synergize with a sneaky character, he just gives you ways to kill things that you can't kill with sneaking.  A SpEn of Dith has to run away a lot, even if they're really, really good at it, a Kiku-worshipping stabber just has a variety of tools that allow them to kill just about anything.  Biggest dangers are enemies like Orbs of Fire or Cerebov who can melt through simulacra easily and are immune to pain brand (granted, they're some of the biggest dangers to anyone else anywa).  Undead minions do occasionally give distraction stabs, though."
dcss,38cesa,Quazifuji,2,Thu Jun 11 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Turn off stealth right now, even the last +'s are not completely necessary. You overtrained evocation really, because the way SpEn and SpAs win games is by getting haste to <10% and having that on for whenever things notice them. You can already outrun most of the things you will run into, and the umbra will help with others forgetting about you. Learn Repel Missiles and use that to train charms and spellcasting and then transition into Deflect Missiles and Haste.  Ctrl+F buckler because there is no way in hell you cleared Elf:3 and haven't gotten any enchanted buckler drops. Identify them all and hopefully you'll find a buckler of resistance."

dcss,38cesa,armour_de,2,Wed Jun 3 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"Missed seeing your SpAs character so advice will be a bit more general.   the random number generator just kills you some days. When playing assassins I tend to change weapons several time a fight so I would avoid vampiric on a main weapon.  I have starved a couple spriggans to death when food wasn't spawning as fast as hoped. see below.  Basically getting hungerless third level casting and then Confuse and Ensorcelled hibernation is useful most of the game.  A backup plan to stabbing eventually becomes required to make it through some points as some enemies are hex proof and far too good at seeing you coming. For Elf I usually clear it with a Spriggan once I have over 100 hit points to prevent hellfire death in one hit, Deflect Missile for the archers and bolt spells, a good Confuse rate, and 10+ curare needles.  One Curare kills most elves fairly quickly, and two curare needles prevents even most priests from saving them.  Save curare for things that can cast the instant death spells and then dart and retreat.   Mid game hexes can keep stabbing going, but late game you need an alternative damage source and earth or air based casting can provide that.  From my experiences with SpAs and SpEn (pretty much the same end build but one start with needles and looks for spells early and the other starts with spells and look for needles early on) some general advice:  Dithmenos works well for spriggans as bleeding shadows works during the very important running away stage of things.  Shadow mimic on needles and hexes helps those quite a bit.  Shadow Step is nice, but can land you right in the middle of more than you can handle if used incautiously.  Ashenzerai works well, curse everything but your weapon so you can switch short blade, blow gun, and slings in and out.  The magic skills bonuses work well given the range of magic skills you eventually want to run and the Scrying is great for waiting around corners for someone to walk close to you.  Also allows areas to be checked in advance to know how far to advance into new areas to prevent getting overwhelmed.  Sif Muna has some utility for a sorta stealthy caster if you start branching away from stealth mid game.  Viable route depending on you items and mutations.  Throwing is a vital skill. With blowguns:    - poison kills small minions around tougher ones    - curare kills tougher ones (especially elves)    - sleep/confusion used to get stabbing bonuses on things you can't hex.  Shootng an enemy with a blowgun and retreating until the rest of the group is out of site while it follows is vital for whittling down large groups one at a time.  Even if the needle can't damage the enemy a poison needle can get a hydra or similar to follow you from the group to get Hibernation or Confuse cast on it 3-6 times to get it to a stabable state without waking the rest.  With good stealth you can make multiple approaches this way before the whole group wakes.  This is probably one of the larger changes from pure melee, peeling off people one at a time to get the group size down while the main body of the group is still sleeping.  Tomahawks can have decent damage to kill chasing enemies and finish off poisoned ones faster if they are alone.  Even with no points in slings if you can find a good sling the cross training with throwing can make it work fairly well with no direct XP investment.  A sling and 200 rocks can kill many non-ranged enemies that don't regen or heal fast.  This is my usual fall back for things I can't melee and failed to stealth kill if I don't have the good hexes yet  Spells are what keep a SpAs going mid to late game.  Hexes and Charms get +2 and +4 aptitude respectively.  You want both, but will finish with more points in Charms in my experience.  If you are not running high power Repel or preferably Deflect Missile by the time you get cyclops throwing large rocks you will have problems.  You will spend a lot of time running away and repositioning on a group once it has spread out looking for you, ranged weapons and spells are your biggest issue.  Liches have some of the higher PitA factor for Spriggan Stabbers as they can't be needled or hexed to any effect, and retreat after a failed stab is very hard.  Haste is good for escapes and the occasional murder faster when needed. Butterflies is also great during escapes.  Crystal spears and OoD have to kill intervening butterflies before they can get to you.  Invisibility is rather limited though as most things can see invisible in the later game, and you won't get it early on so I frequently skip it  early on unless I really go into Hexes for some reason and cap Hexes at around 10 for much of the game.  Flight negates stealth and speed penalties for crossing water, and some source of flight is nearly required in Swamp and Shoals to prevent things catch up to you when running away.  You probably have some air and ice to help those along.  You will probably find Ozocubu's Armour useful, Condensation Shield less so as short blades and throwing is mostly one handed, and an enchanted buckler can bring some good resistances.  Once you have some Ice and Air look at getting Conjuration and Freezing Cloud.  This can cover a lot of retreats both killing enemies and preventing many fire throwing enemies from killing you on the way out.  Also freezing cloud into a room and back out letting it kill a few, and while creatures will wake up most won't see you.  Poison Cloud and Ignite Poison can have a similar effect, but the extended setup can cause you more problems as you need 2-4 rounds to get a good setup and then you still have to run away, but the damage is higher.  Ice Spells aren't great as the undead and demons that cause you many problems are also cold resistant.  Air or Earth are better for damage spells if you are having trouble getting good ranged weapons.    Alternative to Ice with Ozocubu's Armour and Freezing Cloud is Stone Skin, Petrify, Rapid Deconstruction, and Iron Shot.  Petrify is a good escape spell as the front guy in a corridor freeze solid and everyone else bunch up behind and you keep moving.  Rapid Deconstruction does good damage to liches and other skeletal undead with some lighter area damage and smite targeting is great with it. Also good for wall removal.  Iron shot is just to kill things at a distance.  Confuse, and Enscorcelled Hibernation can carry you through a lot of the early, midgame and branches like the Vaults that don't resist those very well.  Confuse for stabbing bonuses is how I kill most undead.  Dazzling Spray also works on many creatures that can't be hexed especially if you are also planning on getting Freezing Cloud later.  Mephitic Cloud works quite well fairly far into the game, orcs, elves, centaurs, and yaktaurs are all fairly well effected by it.  No points in poison required, just get Air and Conjuration.  Use spells that confuse or sleep enemies to keep the stabbing bonuses flowing and it will keep your damage up.  If a group is descending on you every confused enemy is temporarily out of the fight and Hibernate followed by a stab kills most enemies in two actions.  The +4 Spriggan Translocation aptitude works well with Portal Projectile so you can fire needles to the back of groups to deal with trouble some enemies like Orc Priests with Smiting or summoners with minions in front.  Shroud of Golubria and Blink are also useful.  If you go high level Translocation for Controlled Blink the new Translocation spells (Grells Gravitas, Singularity) add some attack ability as well."

I have not won with a SpAs yet, the transition from mid to late game keeps killing me when stabbing gets low, but I do get there with some consistency.  My greater experience is with Spriggan caster builds hence my advice focuses a lot on moving to casting based damage with an element that previously got trained for defenses.  Someone might tell my why this is far less viable than it seems after playing dedicated casters, but it is currently the route I keep trying.  The Kiku+pain brand for moving towards the end game seems to get a lot of recommendations but I haven't tried it yet myself."

dcss,38cesa,Pblur,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"I got a 15-rune ascension my first try with a SpEn of Dith. Only my second 15-runer too, so it's not that I'm amazing at this game or anything. ;)  Here's a link to the CIP->YAVP thread: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=13975&p=194884#p194884  It's really, really, really hard to overstate how good Shadow Form is. As a stabber you don't WANT to kill everything. You want loot, runes and an orb. That's it. Kills are only a tool to that end. Positioning is far more potent.   The best late-game spells on a stealth hero are probably Apportation, Controlled blink and Haste. You have two more skills: a blink that's conditional, but pierces -ctele (Shadow Step), and the most ridiculous escape/rune-snatch ability in the ENTIRE game (Shadow Form). Plus auto LOS blocking vs smiters, etc.  I completely disagree with the idea that Dith is too much of a do the same things better god for Spriggan sneaks. He actually provides you the tools to diversify into evasiveness over stabbing. Which is the easiest and best diversification for Spriggans.  Put another way, Tomb is the branch best set up to prevent sneaking runes to victory. -cTele, long twisty passages, lots of smiting and torment attacks, high MR. Any noise wakes up a ton of monsters. You have to sneak past several dozen mummies (including lots of tormenting ones) in the last vault alone.  You can sneak the tomb rune with Shadow Form. I can't imagine doing this with any other god. You might be able to kill your way through with the shining one, or necromancy summon with Kiku. But with Dith on a stealthy character, you can use your core skills (stealth, hexes, and translocations) to get even the hardest objectives.  For more general advice, there was a really good CIP thread here: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6998&p=96014 where I (and some others) gave a pretty good mid-late game guide for spriggans more generally (that guy was doing an Ash build).

Penetration would be nice to deal with smiters and hellfirers. I do not think that a big switch to spells is necessary, with a GDA you will not be casting much else than repel missiles and maybe blink anyway. For future development, I would probably work on invo, greater servants provide a nice edge in many fights. Evo is always a strong choice as well if you can get your hands on a rod of clouds for crowd control.  As for branches, depths is the clear choice, but I see you went there already. Crypt is the next obvious one. Zot is doable but there is not much loot there. As soon as you get rmut you can go for abyss, even if you don't it is doable but scary, just equip a ring of tele and use it the second you see a wretched star.   Since you have rCorr you can also go for slime. Blast shining eyes from far away to avoid getting malmutated (they need line of sight to hit you, so abuse other enemies and fog), there are not too many of them in general. The royal jelly can be dealt with swiftly with haste+torment+torment+immolation+a few blasts, though it is always an emotional rollercoaster. Then I would clear the vestibule of hell, and reconsider at that moment.  On a side note, I see that you have been abyssed six times (!) already, this is either due to lack of MR (but now you are fine), or a lack of precautions against distortion weapons. For the latter it is VERY helpful imo to edit your rcfile to force stop messages when reading the space bends stuff."

dcss,37zsof,ryeoldfashioned,3,Sun May 31 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"You're using the wrong comparison metric, Flat-damage-bonus brands like Elec are better on small fast weapons than the same brand is on larger, heavier weapons, it doesn't tell you anything about it's relative value to a percentage based damage brand on the same weapon.  FWIW Elec is better than almost any other brand on nearly any weapon (with most levels of skills and stats) except in cases where something is especially vulnerable to that element. (Pain can be better with sufficient necromancy against non-undead or demons, distortion is very slightly better damage on average, but has the awkward disadvantage of blinking or teleporting away the thing you're smacking, although it also banishes, and holy will consistently do more damage against demons and undead with any weapon except a quick blade (unless you've excessively overtrained it)  Vorpal (crushing, slicing, peircing etc.) is actually the worst of the percentage based brand (although it can't be resisted which is nice)"
dcss,37zsof,Stiegurt,2,Mon Jun 1 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but that's just the base damage, your m&f skill significantly increases that, and the fire/ice/crushing scales with total damage."
dcss,37zsof,Nukeliod,1 point,Sun May 31 21:13:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed you are right. Every point of weapon skill gives 2%, every point of fighting 1.76%, every point of STR gives maybe 3% or something like that."

dcss,37zsof,Stiegurt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:52:00 2015 UTC,"So, the greater weapon/fighting skills and STR you have, the more % based brands (flaming, vorpal, holy) benefit, while the fixed damage of the elec brand does not increase.  So despite the calculations in my original post, with a good amount of skills and STR a flaming brand on a great mace may indeed do more damage than an elec brand.  My current character has (from memory) something like 15 Fighting, 20 M&F, and 20 STR.  If I understand what you and Stiegurt below wrote, the Flaming brand actually does more damage than elec (assuming no resistances of course)."

Elec brand has a 33% chance of doing 10-24 damage, which I calculate as doing an additional 5.6 per turn.     A few things wrong with this comparison: first, elec does 8-20 damage now (4.6 per attack on average). Second, you compared the average elec damage with crushing damage calculated from the weapon's max base damage, not the average. But, third, that's not how it works anyway because crushing, like other multiplicative brands, is calculated on the total damage (modified by skills, stats, slaying, etc), not just on the weapon's base damage.    Aside from that, what Stiegurt said."
dcss,37zsof,I_Probably_Think,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks.  Sounds like one all this is calculated, framing/freezing brands would would do more damage than elec on a great mace one you factor in 20 M&F skill, 15 fighting skill, and 20 Str (roughly my current character's stats).  I'm not sure the crushing brand would do more though.  I'd love to have an in-game display of average damage for a weapon reflecting all skills, stats, and gear.  I know it varies by enemy AC but even if you only showed it against a single arbitrary AC it would help players understand the mechanics much better.

dcss,37v5gx,chaostheal,3,Sat May 30 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"The best god is the one you find early. It takes some time for most gods to give you cool abilities, so by waiting for the ideal god you are handicapping yourself.  Stabbers play well with Dith because they enjoy the stealth bonus and the increased melee damage later on. They play well with Ash because they can see through walls and have skill boosts. They also play well with Yred because he provides distractions. The magic gods provide versatility and an offensive boost in case your stabs fail. The plant god Fedhas helps with distractions and escape. Even Trog the berserker god can give you rare stabbing weapons and powerful allies in case you are detected.  Stabbers can play well with any god except the Shining One, because he makes you too... shiny. But any other god is fine, and much better than not having a god because you haven't found a particular altar yet."

If you are focusing on only a few skills and like being able to use blowguns, Dith could be the better choice.  On one hand with Ash you can prepare for battles.  On the other, with Dith, the shadow step can help you win battles, and the shadow form can help you escape."
dcss,37v5gx,9to,2,Sat May 30 18:39:53 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I guess my question for you now is how viable is needle stabbing vs being able to use fire related spells and invocable?

dcss,37szvc,theSIGINT,2,Sat May 30 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"Important to note, I believe the wall to the up-right only looks diggable because it hasn't been revealed yet.

Not familiar with that race, I know they can dig though - can they dig through Stone? I thought only Shatter could do that."
dcss,37szvc,AngusOReily,2,Sat May 30 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure he can. I know Formicids can dig walls in Pan, but I'm unsure if they can go through stone. That being said, I don't think it changes the outcome at all. Formicids are built so the can't really run, they need to prepare and stand and fight. If he was in a tough enough spot against one bladedancer that he felt the need to dig down, he's a ghost now. That archer is going to get at least 2-3 shots before he can get out of LoS, he's going to get spammed with high level casts from the annihilators and to top it all off, the demonologist is almost certainly going to see him before he can make a murder tunnel, meaning he might have to deal with hellfire or torment from summons. Heck, assuming he can dig, he could be screwed as simply by the conjurers above him summoning a rat in the square he needs to dig from to start breaking LoS.   But do not let his death be in vain. Let it serve as a lesson to all future ant-men the dangers of digging down to escape, and that it should only be done in times of the greatest threat. Formicids are a challenge, and should be played with great caution."
dcss,37szvc,T0lias,2,Sat May 30 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"Well this most likely will end in your death, but depending on the rng's mood, it might not. What I'd do is move NW then probably N (if you don't die in a move). Then quaff might+agi and start killing. Being surrounded with sorcerors isn't actually that bad, as I think they don't throw hellfire/acid bolt if there's a chance they'll hurt an ally. On the other hand they might start summoning, which could range from bad to deadly.  If you aren't 2shotted by the annihilators and you get to kill a few elves, your chances of survival will rise considerably due to Makh healing. I'd consider summoning a greater demon if you are alive at that point. If at any point you feel safe (lol), try to dig a killhole.  Don't try to run from a group of sorcerors, they will roast you."

SInv is there, so I'd say go to Nest first, hope you find some more rF. That Archmagi robe is a great find and many use it for the whole game.  And DMsl works exactly like RMsl, it's just stronger.  You can never train Fighting too much.  About the spells, fire up a second game in wizard mode - it's probably the easiest way to get to know them.

dcss,37govu,Slogo,1 point,Wed May 27 14:45:30 2015 UTC,"Take advice from someone more experienced... But in my experience the DMG from statue is good but not stellar unless you have haste available.  You deal more DMG/hit so enemy ac factors in less, but you also overkill more so a lot of that DMG goes to waste vs multiple normal ac targets.  The ac is really nice against low dmg foes, but you already do well vs them probably and as a heavy armor user you don't gain the same Ac boost as a caster since you meld armor anyways.  IMO train charms first, if you get haste then you can go for statue form if you want it. If you have no charms yet focus on other stuff like invocations or dodging."

Even with a low encumbrance it's harder to cast in than robes and once in statue form it does nothing. The best armor for statue form is going to be something loaded with resistances for fighting elemental DMG out of statue form or something that makes the spell more castable in the first place.

dcss,37a757,Goggless,9,Tue May 26 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"Here's some notes I wrote down as I was learning the game.  They might be helpful:   Don't get cocky.  Eventually you'll get on a roll with an awesome character and forget to be careful.  Watch out for this folly of hubris!  (Be patient) Poison resistance is paramount in the early game.  Be careful if you are poisoned and don't be afraid to back out of a fight ""early"" if you are.  Poison can kill a low HP character very fast. Know your escape options.  Scrolls of blinking are often the best in close combat because they are instant.  Scrolls of teleport are great on levels you've explored most of, but they take a few turns to activate.  Scrolls of fog are amazing when you're faced with a deadly ranged threat. Use stair dancing for large groups of enemies.  If you're in a new area you can mitigate risk by pulling a few enemies there up the stairs with you.  (Any enemy touching you on a stair will follow you up/down when you ascend/descend) Beware of unique enemies!  These are the enemies with names like ""Jessica"" and ""Pikel"" (random examples).  Usually they have a special set of skills that make them far deadlier than the average enemy.  Look at them with X and V or look them up on the Crawl wiki if you like before engaging in combat. Summoned enemies die when their masters do!  This is very helpful when fighting a huge group that's cornered you.  If you can take out that one elf summoner, all his demon pals die with him. If you can't beat an area right away, or it seems very hard, you can always save it for later!  Dangerous areas to sit on for awhile include Vaults:5, Elf:3, and Zot:5. You can close doors manually with Ctrl-C.  This can save you from bees, a very dangerous enemy type for weak characters.  Also a lot of other ""mindless"" enemies do not know how to open doors.  This seemingly dumb trick can save you in the early game."

dcss,37a757,SirKrieger,2,Tue May 26 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Never fight near unexplored space if you can help it. If you aren't sure about a monster, back up and fight it somewhere you know you've cleared.  Limit your exposure to attacks. Fight large groups at choke points to avoid being surrounded. You CAN fight single monsters in the open where you can dodge around them, but keep a corridor nearby in case more show up.  Always have a fairly clear escape route back to the stairs. When you aren't sure you can kill a monster, try and escape it. Your first priority is usually keeping your escape route clear.  The scariest monsters are the ones that you can't easily escape.  My preferred ways to escape monsters (Easy situational options first, reliable panic buttons last):   Just walk away if it's immobile or slower than you If the monster can't cross water/lava and you can, do that. If there are lots of intersections, get out of its line of sight and lose it in the maze. If it doesn't have hands (or is incredibly stupid), it can't open doors. Shut one behind you. Note: Some later monsters are big enough to break them down. Run up the nearest stairs and down another staircase. This works on anything, but monsters adjacent to you when you go up can follow you. If the monster has crappy magic resistance, use a wand or spell to blind, slow, sleep, paralyze, petrify, or confuse it, then walk away. Alternately, charm it, use the 't' command to tell it to retreat away from you, then walk away. These methods are not foolproof. The various escape spells. Passwall, Passage of Golubria, etc. Conjure Flame or other spells that create barriers can work if you've got a corridor or choke point to block Summon something, put it directly between you and the monster, and run off while they fight. Haste yourself with a spell, wand, or potion, then outrun the monster. This is foolproof. Berserking works for a home-stretch sprint to the stairs, but it only lasts a few turns and it screws you hard when it wears off. Scroll of fog to break Line Of Sight, then dart around a corner or two. Very dependent on the terrain layout. Scroll of fear Blinking (Scroll, spell, or evokable) Scroll/wand of teleport   If it's got a name, and either it isn't alone or you aren't at full health, run.  If you have to run, start running BEFORE you are down to half health or a quarter mp.  If it can shoot or cast spells, pick an escape route that blocks its Line of Sight. This goes quadruple if it can smite, torment, or use hellfire.  If you are in a position where one good hit could kill you before your next turn, GET OUT OF THAT POSITION BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. The only thing keeping you alive is fickle fickle luck."

dcss,37a757,Slogo,0,Tue May 26 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, these combinations reinforce very bad habits such as tabbing to victory while not liberally using consumables.   The best thing you can do to improve as a player is to run away often. You most definitely do not need to kill everything you encounter the second you meet them. Apart from that, these - in no particular order - should also help:   Ignore the wiki as there is a ton of terrible information on it. It can be useful to know approximately what spells and monsters can do, but the Strategy and Tips sections are - mostly - bollocks. Your starting background is just that: your starting set of skills. Just because you start with a skill doesn't mean you need to pump it up to 20. Adapt to what you need right now and have a vague long term plan depending on what the dungeon throws at you. Swapping from 6.0 Long Blades to Polearms when Sigmund drops a +5 Scythe of Freezing is a Good Thing. Changing again when you get a +10 War Axe {drain, rF+, rC+, MP+9} in the middle of Lair is fine. Your species aptitudes are general guidelines; a -2 Apt is no reason to ignore a skill. Keep a good balance of Offense, Alternative Offense and Defense. Being a member of Team Melee is fine and good, but some things are still potentially too dangerous to go whack with a stick. Have alternate means of dealing with them. Evocations are a brilliant alternative in most situations. Wands and rods let even the dumbest plate-wearing minotaur deal respectable magical damage, even more so if Xom blesses you with a rod of clouds or ignition. Defensively speaking, resists are - in the vast majority of cases - much, much more important than a couple of points of AC, EV or SH. Always carry an amulet of resist mutation on you. Always, even if you innately resist mutations. You will be thankful for it when you discover what Wretched Stars and Malmutate are. An 8% chance is crawlspeak for ""Will absolutely happen when it will entertain Xom the most""; do not bet your life on a 92% success rate (or an 8% chance of getting hit)."

Personally I think it's far too easy to just give up on low level chars or not try and escape well because of unided consumables where higher level characters you have that extra motivation to be cautious that you should have early on as well. Even worse is getting frustrated or blaming RNG for early misfortunes."

This game is too cruel to get heartbroken over some amazing sword you're never going to see again.   On a more actual-advice note, once you can get a char out of early-game, and you start to get into the middle part, start saving those mid-level games and starting new ones. Every time you sit down to play, start new games, trying out different play styles and char builds. Experiment with these less-important-to-you chars, learn from their deaths so that when you return to your mid-level games you have gained more gameplay experience, without risking those lots-of-time-invested-in-you chars dying to silly tactical blunders.   I mean, have a few high-level games on the go at the same time that you can work on in little bits but really do most of your playing by throwing new chars at the dungeon and learning how to avoid being smeared all over the walls.   Returning to a well developed character after a few weeks or a month of playing other games can really broaden your perspective on what's possible and how your resources can be used. You've learned new things and those mid-game chars really benefit from it. This is better than continuously just sending char after char to frustrating deaths in mid-game.

I played them completely glass cannon (all my experience in offense and none in defense). Despite being a completely untenable combo for extended, it taught me a lot of good habits. Be careful with your character; it can die easily. You're never more than one bad mood from death. Tactical movement is important: where you can put enemies to kill them best while taking the least damage. Basically, don't just play melee brawlers. Playing casters will teach you how to play melee better.  Try out Gargoyles, people (me included) have really good luck with them.  The most important thing anyone said to me about the game is ""You have to focus on killing other things first."" That means getting your weapon to minimum delay or getting your offensive skills into castable percentages with high enough powers. Then focus on your defenses. At the risk of being unhelpful, you can't only focus on offense. When you're killing things really easily or losing health really quickly, you need better defenses.   Collect throwable things like rocks, tomahawks, javelins, blowgun and darts... to throw at things on early levels. Make sure you're hitting dangerous melee enemies from afar before they get in melee range.  Find blind spots for centaur archers, let them come near you, and then move into melee range. They do more damage from afar than up close.  Here's how you explore the dungeon:  1. Do the Dungeon to Lair 2. Do Lair 1-7 and explore Lair 8 (depending on how it looks complete it or leave it) 3. Do Orcish Mines (Run from Orc Warlords if they seem dangerous/have an escort) 4. Do the dungeon till you reach the Depths or it starts getting scary 5. Do the Lair side branches branches (Not Slime; DO NOT go into slime), 1-4 6. Finish the Lair branches 7. Do Vaults 1-4 8. Do depths/Elven Halls (Elven Halls floor 3 is extremely dangerous but has some of the best loot in the game; do it after you absolutely cannot do more Depths) 9. Do Vaults 10. Do Slime/Zot 1-4/Vestibule of Hell/Crypt (Crypt is a great source of piety for The Shining One) 11. Do Hell 12. Do Tomb 13. Do Pandemonium 14. Do Zot 5  15.

You should be enchanting your Crystal Plate and your Demon Whip if you plan to use shields. I'm going to guess you want two handed weapons due to their high base damage.  Remember to keep using your evocables since you have no casting ability, trogs hand and brother in arms are both powerful abilities. If you do go to elf you'll pretty much want to keep that active the entire time to avoid being banished.   Try to find a source of evocable or permanent flight for shoals. Your amulet of clarity will prevent you being mesmerized by sirens. Best tactical advice would be to take things slowly as there are large open spaces and it's easy to get surrounded quickly.  Snake Pits would be easier with rPois but should still okay. Just remember to keep using trogs hand always and use brother in arms BEFORE things get tough."

Any advice on my skill training?  Thank you!
dcss,379o9d,quik2903,1 point,Tue May 26 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"1) Crystal Plate Armor is a very good armor for a Mibe. I'd enchant it, yes. If you find a better artifact armor you won't be able to enchant it anyway.  2) As a berserker, you probably want to do as much damage as possible, therefore going with a 2 handed. That Undeadhunter (+7 great mace) is pretty good. I'd use it.  Do you know about min delay? If you check the description of a great mace, you'll see it has 1.7 base delay and 0.7 min delay. That means that if you use a great mace with 0 skill in Maces & Flails, each swing takes 1.7 turns (or 17 auts). Another fact you need to know is that for each 2 points you train in Maces & Flails, your delay gets reduced in 0.1, until you reach min delay, which is 0.7 for a great mace, which means that each swing takes 0.7 turns. Therefore, if you'll be using a great mace, you need to train Maces & Flails to 20 in order to reach min delay. (base - min delay) * 2 * 10 = (1.7 - 0.7) * 2 * 10 = 20  You already have 19.2, so you'll get the 20 pretty soon. After that it's not worth training more Maces & Flails.  3) Regarding your skills. First priority, get M&F to 20 if you'll use the great mace. Next, your EV is very low. You can easily train some dodging to get some extra EV points. Maybe till 10 or so. After that, train fighting, armour, dodging, the higher the better; and evocations if you plan on using wands and evocables.  I'm also noticing that you don't have any throwables. It's useful to keep some, even if you're not using them, in order to eventually being able to wake up a monster and lure it to a safe area to kil it."

In Snake you'll find a lot of nagas that will poison you a lot. Not a problem if you carefully fight 1v1 all the time. Moreover, there are salamanders which do fire damage (you should be ok as you have rFire) and shock serpents which do electric damage (you won't find many though).  Shoals displays very open layouts with water. You'll find lots of merfolks. In general, you have to be careful with mesmerize (a enchantment that doesn't let you move away of the siren or avatar that's casting it). But you have clarity, which deals with it, so that's not an issue. Invisibility is very good in Shoals, as most of the merfolks don't see invisibility. You can give your cloak good use.  Seeing your equipment, I'd go to Shoals first. Be very careful, try to lure enemies back and fight one on one. This is especially true for the final level, which contains a vault with huge numbers of monsters.  Don't feel committed to finishing Shoals no matter what. If you find difficulties, go to Snake Pit and come back when you're stronger. You can even do Shoals 1-4 and Snake 1-4 and only then do Shoals 5 and Snake 5, as the final floors are more difficult.  Regarding Slime Pits and Elven Halls, I'd recommend you stay away of both. They're very nasty if you don't know what you're doing. You don't need them to win your first game.  Good luck!

dcss,36yhad,Otterlegz,1 point,Sat May 23 07:29:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's a really good question though. I'd have to really dig around my memory to sort thigs out a bit. There's honestly a lot that I've forgotten that I don't know I've forgotten, or don't know that are different.  But as far as it goes, I haven't played very much much for a few years now. A little on-and-off. The earliest version I seem to have on my HD is 0.9.1, but the morgue only has a small handful of characters in there, so clearly the majority of my play is before then.  Giving a quick look, I was a part of the DCSS Tourney of 2010, which was version 0.7, so I've really been out of the loop for a while.  First and foremost, the changes to races and classes were the biggest shock. No more priest, paladin, thief?, stalker, deathknight, healer. A few new races, some of which are pretty neat to say the least. No more sludge elf, no more Mountain Dwarf. I always heard MDFi was a staple, though I never had much success.  The second most notable change was colors. I don't have any idea how tiles plays, personally I play console, so these changes may or may not be present or the same in tiles. The colors of potions and scrolls. I think that's my single favorite feature coming into the modern age. Blue is unidentified, yellow is useful, white is typically identify, gray is garbage. It's not huge, since the game obviously tells you what is there, but it's a great visual touch that let's me know without having to read it, or look through the text if there's a bunch of stuff going on or showing up.  The third thing I noticed is that experience and how skills train in regards to has changed a lot. However since I dabbled with a game or two since 0.7, and had read about the exp changes when it happened, I was prepared for the way exp works now. Though there will always be a place in my heart for Victory Dancing.   The last thing of note is something I can only talk very superficially about. Previously, the furthest I'd ever gotten was all the way through the Lair and into the Lair branches. I'd only gotten to any branches maybe three or four times and had been entirely unsuccessful. So as to say, I was still really new to that part of the game and rather unfamiliar. But the way the Dungeon was laidout, the branches, the whole Depths and Vaults seemed a little different to me. I don't recall previously needing to descend into a special branch, I could have sworn the Dungeon just kept going down.  As for combos, still pretty newb. My two most successful were a Halfling Barbarian and a Sludge Elf Conjurer. My Halfling drowned in the Shoals because I had no idea what to expect. Didn't expect that. My SECj, I don't remember how he died, but I did pretty well with the caster. I remember using the battlesphere a lot with that build. In general, I tend to play a better caster than any other class.  In regards to GrEE, because I've had the most luck/success with casters, I think that helped me a lot with the GrEE: I was used to playing a caster and smashing things. The GrEE was a bit tough at first, the low HP and all, but looking at a Sludge Elf, I don't think that was that much different. The thing that really did it for me were definitely the perks of being a Gargoyle. Not having to breath, immune to rot and pretify, rP, rE, the AC boost, and the flying. Flying is a great touch for the obvious reasons, but the rest of it just made for a caster that was a big hunk of survivability compared to any other caster i'd ever played. The survivability was super-key here, and I don't know if I could do that again with another race any time soon. But I guess that right there should be my next goal.  I've also recently tried playing other berserkers, and a couple fighters, but with very little success. The GrEE has that added ability to smash things at a range, but still be able to take some hits up-close. Something that I can handle better."

After fighting (get at least 120hp) get dodging so you don't take big hits from everything (23+ EV), get into something better for armor so you have decent AC, then focus back in on Earth Magic and spell casting. That or evocs since you have a crystal ball, but crystal balls are pretty scary when you don't have another way to get MP.  Also use spells appropriate for the monster you are fighting. LRD, Petrify, and Stone Arrow are all still important because they potentially don't drain your mana as much as blasting everything with iron shot.  I'd also learn stoneskin for the 5-6 AC you'll get from it. It doesn't seem like much, but there's a pretty big difference when your AC is low."

A staff of earth is easily one of the strongest melee weapons in the game with high earth/evo, and evocations can double for panic button duty with rods and elemental summon items. With his evo and earth skills where they are, he already has 100% activation of the bonus damage (which is currently an average of ~15 extra damage per hit, and can get as high as 25.3ish on average), and min delay thanks to 12 staves.

Other options that might help you survive until the teleport goes off are: haste, resistance, heal wounds, fear.  I'm not sure what I would do in your situation, however you do have a lot of heal wounds charges, so I'd probably use a charge of heal wounds and hope your health ends up higher than when it started, then read a teleport, if your health is still about 40-50+ then something like fear/resistance, otherwise heal wounds again."

Are you really short on nice jewelry this game?  Both rings you're wearing seem a bit underwhelming, though to be fair I don't remember what the ring of Shadows' umbra does exactly - that could be very nice to help your EV perhaps.

Blink is an important tactical spell which allows you to create gaps and reposition. Normally I would learn it before depths or just before V:5. Repel missiles allows you to get much more out of your EV. I would often try to learn repel missiles sometime late during lair branches on heavy armour chars (much earlier on lighter armour). Enemy missiles are most dangerous in snake (sharpshooters), shoals (various enemies), and vaults/depths (variety of spellcasters and ranged enemies).  In a 15 rune game, most of the utility level 1-4 spells are available to learn for heavy armour chars. Haste is the main exceptional spell as it's level 6 and can still be worth training for, but if you have a haste wand it's often a waste of experience to go for the spell."

dcss,36g85c,Slogo,1 point,Tue May 19 13:37:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that regeneration is very useful. So long as your god allows it, learning it in a 15 rune game is a great idea. In a 3 rune game, probably the xp can be put to better use.  Swiftness I honestly don't find very useful outside of the early game. If you need speed to escape, use some form of hasting. The short duration of low power swiftness and the slow period really damages its usefulness.  Song of slaying is a cool spell, and probably goes well with Qazlal as you say. It also works well when you're in a killhole and engaging enemies one at a time. I used to learn it often but I've since stopped doing so, because I just didn't end up using it much and Qazlal isn't a god I generally like using."

dcss,36g85c,zxc223,2,Tue May 19 22:55:13 2015 UTC,"I am fairly sure that the way RMSL works is to reduce the accuracy of missiles by a particular semi-randomised percentage. If you have almost no EV, it should have little effect. With a lot of EV like 30+, you'll find that missiles will rarely land with RMSL, and just about never with DMSL. I wouldn't learn RMSL in a low EV scenario like <6 EV but really, you should be doing all you can to improve your EV."

dcss,36g85c,zxc223,2,Wed May 20 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"That can be the case sometimes. However, you can still get some EV from a ring, and going from 5 to 11 is quite a boost, for instance.  Normally what I prefer is to use a regular shield or a buckler if I am going to use a shield, raise dex on most chars, and train at least 20 dodging by endgame. With plate armour, this usually nets around 30 EV, which is a sweet spot for avoiding a ton of attacks. With most chars this will result in about 35 AC as well, or 50+ with gargoyles. I would rather have 40 AC and 30 EV than 60 AC and 10 EV.  ""The best defense is a strong offense"" is very true in crawl. Unless you have a very good reason to use shields (such as a fantastic 1H weapon and good shield available or vice-versa), go for a 2H weapon and focus on AC/EV for your defense. Trog will pretty much guarantee you an amazing 2H weapon, which is partly why Trog is so good."

Simpler spells that are good include Repel Missiles (level 3), Control Teleport (Level 4 Charms/Translocation),  Summon Butterflies (Level 1 Summoning), Swiftness (Level 2 Charms/Air), Blink (Level 2 Translocation), Passwall (Level 2 or 3 I think Transmutation/Earth), Passage of Golubria (L4 or L5 Translocation).    None of them are damage-dealers but they are great defensive or escape tools.  A long-term goal is the Haste spell which is a L6 pure Charms spell.    Very powerful but I have killed many of my characters in the attempt to focus Charms to get that spell online ASAP, thus neglecting skills like Armour and Fighting or a good ranged attack, like Crossbows."

Do you pay 3000 gold and then as enemies wander into your FoV they take money from the ""Bribe Pool"" and become your ally, or does it make random enemies across the area turn non-hostile? How well did bribe branch deal with the initial clusterfuck?"
dcss,36dqvl,Bobthemightyone,6,Mon May 18 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Good questions.   Yes, the wiki is a little vague about Gozag since he is a newer God.   Here is what I learned about Bribe Branch.   Maybe one of the developers who lurks around this reddit page can clarify or correct me.   Some enemies become ""friendly"" but NOT allies, meaning you cannot command them.    They do fight against hostiles but they don't follow you, they just make their own decisions. Other enemies become full allies and they will follow your commands until the bribe fund gets exhausted, at which time I think they just become neutral (NOT hostile).    They will also follow you to other areas of the game, they don't just stay in their native branch. Only the actual natives of the Vaults become friendly, so it's the humans:  Vault Guards, Convokers, Sentinels, Wardens. I was running under the (possibly false) assumption that the bribe fund would eventually get exhausted or the bribe fund would only ""trickle down"" to a certain  number of floors  within the Vaults.    So instead of using the Bribe Branch ability right when I arrived in Vaults:1, I waited until I had already cleared  V1:V4 and also had cleared Depths 1:5.    Then I came back to V:4, invoked the Bribe Branch ability, and went downstairs.     At first glance it appeared that 25-30% of the Vault Guard welcoming party was friendly towards me.     I immediately cast Passage of Golubria, portaled myself into one of the side hallways, and got away from the central stairs.    No immolation nuke, of course ... I wanted to let my bribed buddies fight it out. Throughout all of the four quadrants of V:5 a good portion of the humans did become either friendly or allied, which was very nice not to have Sentinel's Marks cast on me, and Convokers summoning a bunch of their hostile friends."

That PDA was $3,800 but worshipping Gozag produces such a ridiculous amount of gold, by the time I got about halfway through the Depths I was rolling in cash again.

However, given how infrequently I am able to get 3 runes, I am guessing the passive gold distraction was a pretty big help.    Once you get into Vaults and Depths, some of those monsters can do serious damage in a single turn .... so any one turn that they are distracted and not attacking you is a huge benefit.

You don't have to kill everything that comes into view, like sigmund can deal devastating damage in the early game with his almost always enchanted scythe, try to avoid him if you lack high AC.   If youre going to keep going, i recommend ""elven halls"" in the last level of orcish mines, but only the first 2 levels.

Personally with my DS I tend to take either maces because there's plenty of decent 1-h weapons early on, axes because with their mutation defensive boost they can take full advantage of the cleave effect or polearms because trident are easy to come by and are quick to level up to decent damage output. If my DS doesn't start with a weapon or skill I'll often level up maces a bit at first because it cross-trains both to polearms and axes.   I will seriously consider axes if they develop the miasma mutation and will almost always invest in shields if they have the scales that give SH bonus."

Then again Crawl is luck based. Every single fucking time I go to the Shoals I get a kraken spawn on floor 1, and I'm pretty sure it kraken don't always spawn as I've seen other peoples games without them on the first floor, so it's probably just shitty luck on my part.

I quickly had 14 in staff and good stealth/armour/invoc so the rest has been just fooling around. I am actually surprised I got this far.   I had never played with animate skeleton and got trigger happy with it… they've been a nice bone-shield but didn't make that much of a difference, except a few close calls in vaults.

You won't notice the effects of 4 str, since they are very small; rF+ is something you can easily get on your body armour or another ring, and multiple rF+ is not important even in Zot; rPois is typically not important outside of the early game and lair branches, and you will often have it on a cloak, body armour or ring; rElec is not important either, and one of the rarest resistances to desire - use resistance potion against Nikola, and high defenses of MiFi take care of pretty much every other elec threat.

Shadow Step - pretty much the sole reason you worship Dith as a stabber Bleed Smoke - equally useful to everyone. Shadow Mimic - pretty much useless to dedicated stabbers, since the entire point of stabbing is to insta-gib dangerous stuff, and again, you're not going to melee with dangerous stuff. Super fucking powerful for everyone else. Basically the reason to worship Dith.  Shadow Form - pretty meh IMO. I guess you can use Shadow Form + haste to ninja the golden rune?   I guess the issue is that there aren't really any gods that synergize extra well with pure stabbers. All of the generically useful gods will be useful to stabbers - Ely, Fedhas, Ash, Yred, Makhleb. Dith's main drawback for stabbers is that he doesn't offer options for when things go pear-shaped.

I'm already making strong use of the blowgun, I'm just having far less success with direct damage weapons so I thought the mechanics were vastly different. I'm guessing that's just sampling bias, then - as I said, I haven't tried often enough to get a clear picture, and searching the code for complex things like this is taxing. (Even learndb says ""nobody understands ranged combat"".)"
dcss,35xeyo,celem83,1 point,Fri May 15 09:33:35 2015 UTC,"Throwing for damage used to be weak but was buffed up a few versions ago, to the point that I have tomahawks in my autopickup and put in at least a little skill on any character. Blowguns and nets have always been great, so a bit of skill is handy for them as well."
dcss,35xeyo,celem83,7,Fri May 15 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"Throwing is a skill that doesnt really cap out, its not particularly wastefull to push it all the way to 27, though stopping around 22 will work just fine and save the epic slog that is the last-5 levels.  Large rocks are a no-brainer, they are awesome if you can wield them.  Javelins and THawks are solid through the rest of the game.  Small stones are generally pretty pointless after early-D unless you managed to stack a good chunk of slay ontop of your thrown skill.  If im going to be actively throwing stuff throughout (not just stones on d1-5) then I want at least 10 thrown skill, at which point you can reasonably expect them to do damage and not just bounce off stuff.  At this point {return} brands become somewhat reliable too. (that one scales against thrown).  If I dont feel I can afford 10 thrown I usually take slings, since they outperform thrown until around this point of investment (and makes all those stones viable suddenly)  I generally use the THawks first and the Javs second.  The javelin does a bit more damage (and is found later assuming orc=thawk and shoals=jav).  My favorite brand is returning, since it reduces the ammo-collection chore.  As a rule I dont carry silver/steel/penetration, but stash them.  Then as I approach endgame (zot) i'll go back and pick those up.  Earlier in your run you almost certainly dont have enough of them to make the inventory slot worth it, even if trog/oka and gifted, you just dont see enough of the branded thrown stuff to use day-to-day.  If you have silver however, decent thrown will happily nobble OoFs for you since they are Chaotic.  There are a few edge-cases that will push me to pickup thrown on characters that werent bothering.  One major one is the Bailey layout containing THawk {return} gobs/hobs and polearm {elec} gnolls.  You can get enough returning hawks from this layout (90-odd) to use for the rest of a 3-rune game.  Also nets.  Nets are quite possibly the single most OP item in the game, they dont even need much skill to use effectively and are perfect for trivialising a really tough 1v1."
dcss,35xeyo,BacchusReborn,1 point,Fri May 15 09:29:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, that's exactly the kind of thorough explanation I was hoping for!  Re: damage - I take it that the skill has much more of an effect on damage than melee skills do, then? Because people usually describe them as pointless beyond mindelay, and the bonus from Fighting is seen as a pleasant side-effect to additional HP as well. Thus, I only ever considered the base damage of throwables that learndb lists (plus brands, of course). Those are tiny compared to the advantages a better position or the opportunity to buff yourself have, advantages that you waste if you spend your turns throwing."
dcss,35xeyo,CelerityDesu,2,Fri May 15 09:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually certain how much the skill is increasing the raw damage per projectile.  But the point to pushing the skill all the way is that (like UC) throwing reaches min-delay at 27.  So by raising the skill you are raising your damage/aut even if not raising damage/projectile.  It becomes noticable after a period, where you can throw 2 or even more weapons for every step the hostile takes.  Much like a fast dagger user I like to ""hack'n'back"" with a quick thrown weapon."

I've even gone so far as to throw every blowgun in the dungeon into deep water. ?acquirement still gave me needles."
dcss,35xeyo,I_Probably_Think,4,Thu May 14 11:35:39 2015 UTC,"Having Shoals in your dungeon helps a lot. You can often pick up ~100 javelins from Shoals alone, many of them silver, so seeing the entrance can be a good decision point for me on whether to raise my throwing beyond 6 or not."

I wouldn't say you should be doing it on D:1-2, but if you've picked up a fair few tomahawks, it's not much of an investment.

dcss,35q9hk,BacchusReborn,1 point,Tue May 12 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"This was an insane run. I had very poor luck finding even a halfway decent weapon early on, and the first ?brand weapon I found turned my +2 flail of suck into a +2 flail of protection. Disheartening. This was my first demonspawn character; I lucked out with the mutations. When I got the first nightstalker mutation, I trained Stealth up to 12 and stabbed things with a +5 rapier (with zero skill). I wasn't at all impressed with his melee killdudes skill, and didn't see any good ranged weapons drop -- and then a shop in Orc:4 sold me the Boots of the Assassin. The boots + nightstalker mutation plus my playing experience as a stabber made the rest of the game much, much easier than it had a right to be.  When I found a few books of Hexes that I knew how to use from extensive failure and occasional success with an enchanter, I started training Hexes. My intent was not to make a hybrid, but that's just how it turned out. I would have liked having more Int, obviously, but I made do.  Now, on to Ru. I was wary of taking any sacrifices without a good idea how they might play out, so I went with -2 strength, -40 wiz, no poison, translocations, or transmutations, -2 experience levels (meaning I was capped at XL 25), and sacrifice hand.  Sacrifice hand turned out much gentler than I expected. It forced me to play more attentively, swapping resistances in as a given foe came within LOS. The only time I felt it really suck was in Vaults and Elf. I dealt with Sentinel's Mark and Banishment by swapping in a ring of *Tele, and riding the wave. I did not use Ru's active abilities much; after the first few Power Leaps, I determined that the duration of exhaustion was at least half again as long as I could stand. I don't know whether the exhaustion lasts longer than that given by berserk, but it was too long for my tastes, particularly given a character rather weak in offense.  Ru's passive abilities kept me alive, no doubt about that. I got through Zot spamming Invisibility. Tiamat was a pain, because I bumped into her while blunt-stabbing a horde of draconians, but I eventually got her. Now I just need Dissolution to complete the set!"
dcss,35q9hk,solovayy,2,Tue May 12 17:11:06 2015 UTC,Nice run. Of note though:  Exhaustion doesn't make your stats worse. It's just common cooldown for berserk/Ru abilities.

dcss,35omdk,gottasay,2,Tue May 12 06:25:15 2015 UTC,"first, thanks for looking over the chardump :) I trained crossbows for some levels because I thought I'd need some kind of ranged combat at some point (also I was scared of electric eels at the bottom vault of the lair which seems silly now, they didn't do that much DMG after all).    the m&f skilling past mindelay is pure ignorance: I simply didn't check when I hit min delay until I was already at 17 or something. regarding the unid potions and scrolls: why did they lose me the game? I figured without burdening, I could just run around with those in case I'd need a desperate reading/quaffing unid stuff. I I didn't want to risk reading or quaffing bad stuff, so I just kept it. what else should I have done with them?"

The blowgun is arguably the most important item for any char during the main dungeon, lair and random lair branches.   I didn't want to risk reading or quaffing bad stuff, so I just kept it.   You shouldn't worry about using bad stuff, you should worry about good stuff. There are no potions or scrolls (except for poison eraly in the game) that can hurt you permanently. Quaffing a potion of mutation may result in annoyances, but you usually find cure mut pretty soon, or just play roulette. The real danger is using your only un-ID'd scroll of blinking, for instance, that's why you read and quaff only what you have multiples of. (Otherwise, you're wasting that thing no matter what and ID'ing it makes no sense. Up to a certain point - press \- to see what you haven't ID'd yet and if there's any precious emergency item, or if you may be carrying acquirement.)"
dcss,35omdk,Eptagon,7,Tue May 12 07:15:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't suggest quaffing potions randomly.

And potions are definitely more valuable, I usually stick to IDing them with scrolls as well unless I have a lot.

dcss,35omdk,thelatestmodel,3,Tue May 12 09:18:53 2015 UTC,"As a MiBe you don't really need a ranged option until later in the game. And possibly not even then.  Slimes are to be fought differently than most other things: if you allow them to stack (e.g. because you fight them in a corridor) the resulting creature will be a much bigger issue than the smaller ones surrounding you would have been. You allowed that thing to become titanic and it killed you with a 93 damage hit. Should have backed away before that to let them split again.  The reason you want the consumables to be identified is that you need to know what escape options you have available. Quaffing poison when you need haste and reading torment when you want blinking is going to kill you. Nothing you read can really destroy you, as long as you do so in a safe environment, so it's good practice to read-ID duplicate scrolls.  Min delay is easy to figure out: 2 points in the skill take off 1 aut (or 0.1 delay). A Dire Flail has 1.3 max and 0.6 min delay, which means you need 7x2=14 levels of M&F to hit min delay.  As a MiBe you should dump all your points into Dex, btw. You have plenty Str anyway and Dex helps both your evasion and your reflexive headbutt.  What lost you the game was not knowing when to run, but the other issues could have killed you in different ways. Mostly the un-ID'd stuff: inefficient skilling/stat assigning isn't likely to completely ruin a MiBe."

dcss,35omdk,skulgnome,5,Tue May 12 09:18:10 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents :   Dire flail has min delay on skill 14, it is better to invest in other skills until you require more. As a berserker, range weapon is not that important, a couple good javelins is good enough for weakening early/mid game strong monster, and crossbow required more skills to be effective. You definitely should use that plate armor, because you sacrifice too many AC just for an extra rF+ and blink+.  You already has a ring of fire protection, and that is enough for early/mid game. Blink is just something good to have, but not required. Since there is no scroll will cause permanent damage, It is better to read all unknown scrolls when you are safe, and spend most identify scrolls on potions until you know mutation/cure mutation. Yes, you should not underestimated a spawn of slime creatures in early/mid game :) Don't fight in corridor because that make them merge quickly. Escape if necessary since they will split when out of sight."

Just something to think about, im even more impressed you got the job done to be honest, I normally wouldnt use it without boots{running} to balance it out.  To be clear you and most enemies are speed 10, there are a few 11s and 12s like bees and storm dragon, bunch of flying/batty stuff.  boots of run takes you to 11, ponderous to 9 and both holds on 10.

You put on all the MR+ gear you can find, and make sure to pay attention to Deep Elf Sorcerers and Deep Elf Demonologists (the only ones who banish).

Annihilater is right there at number 3 due to that LCS, which you cant do much about without EV or RMsl.  I never kill-hole the Elf3 vault, simply becaue there are Fiend summoners and I like being able to see what is up and where they are, since the Fiends will happily torment you over the heads of the stuff jammed in the kill-hole."

I think Elves 3 is something you can do post 3rd rune, for the most part. The enemies are around comparable to some of the stuff you see in Zot. There's some pretty reasonable loot in there if you can clear it out, but the spellcasters are nasty. Funny enough, that run I wasn't too worried about the abyss. I actually survived an unlucky distortion brand banishment in swamp via liberal use of teleport scrolls. But in Elves, I've heard people say that you should have at least +++ MR before it's close to safe.

dcss,35asvt,Slogo,7,Fri May 8 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say invest a few points into spell casting to get your mana pool up. With the mana shield passive you really need to be careful and make sure you don't run out of mana during fights (later on you'll get higher ranks of the mutation + powered by pain and things will work out). Then get fireball online and you have a good enough spell set to take you to lair so start focusing dodging/fighting. Once your dodging and fighting are in a good place you can then go back and start working on charms for deflect missiles (if you don't find rMissile by then) and take it from there depending on what other spell books you find. You'll probably want rMissile or deflect missiles online by the time you are thinking about lair branches so just plan for that.  Don't worry about pumping the power of your spells too much (yet). With Ash once you start cursing jewelry and gain piety he'll give you a good boost to keep the spells relevant. It's going to be more important to have a reasonable EV and HP pool in the short term.  You may also want to invest into staves after getting your dodging going (again because of the passive) or another weapon school if you prefer, but nothing that takes too serious of an investment. Just some insurance against weak monsters if you happen to get drained of mana.  Ash's spell school boosting ability from your jewelry + a staff of conjuration means you'll already be pretty far along in ability to cast destructive spells so you will want to use the opportunity to establish good defensive skills (again especially with your shield demonspawn mutation).  I think the book of the sky is largely irrelevant at this point; conjure ball lightning is a questionable non-fire spell to invest in; it's dangerous and it functions similar to fireball (anti-group spell) whereas you're mostly looking for a spell that will pick off the one off fire resistant monster.

If your god isn't providing outs vs tough fights like Ru or some others do, then you'll want to have something else online, but it doesn't need to be conjurations.

That gets you trough lair, orc, dungeon, spider/shoals/swamp (_not_snake), into elf:2 and you can loot hall of blades for quickblades of pain/distortion.   What do you do while waiting for contam to go away? Melee sprig is one option. I usually train SB to 12 and spend ?acq on weapon, will net a quickblade usually. Hope for good brand. Nikola also has electrocution brand often or any of the orcs. Electrocution gets with with some minor or big trouble trough vaults 1-4.   After that points it gets hard being a melee/stealth spriggan. Retreat often, use whatever edge you have, or dive straight to Zot- draconians cannot see invisible again. Of course you need a third rune; vaults 5 is too hard with this build. Slime is good, either stab TRJ or haste/might/agility or immolation work just fine, but have repel/deflect missile up.   Abyss works equally well, stealthy spriggans can survive forever even on abyss 5. Rune comes into sight apport it teleport away before the guardians have any clue.  melee spriggans profit immensely from the spells that give pain/distortion brand though its a bit tedious.   Some people like conjurations, I find that hard to pull off due to -3apt and go for earth/air, they have single-school lvl9 spells. For these there is just enough XP in the game to get them online before zot:5, potentially popping into the Zigg to get a bit of XP.   Another way if you are lucky with a rod or the elemental invokers is to train evocation to >20. From vault/depth onwards the monsters are worth so much XP that they recharge in a single fight. And with nearly maxed evo its good enough to take down zot:5."

dcss,352hvg,qntl,3,Wed May 6 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"It's actually not true that teleporting ""leaves you no closer to finding an exit"". Basically every newly-revealed tile has a small chance to be an unusual feature, and every tile that's an unusual feature has a small chance to be an exit portal. When you teleport you reveal a whole area of new tiles at once, more than you would by moving one square diagonally, so you do slightly increase your chances of finding an exit. If you've got evocable teleportation (a ring or artifact gear), teleporting as often as you can without building up contamination will really help find the exit, and it minimizes enemy pursuit as well. Having teleportitis from a mutation or gear actually helps a lot too, but that's going to get ""fixed"" in the next release version."
dcss,3543dp,P4duke,1 point,Wed May 6 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"You have almost every resistance, combined with huge AC. I would probably keep rMut cursed over rCorr as a permanent option, although prefer to keep uncursed really so you can swap.  Your weapon-kill-dudes is possibly a bit weak. Staff of earth is only really decent against popcorn, while a lajatang of elec is nice if you get sapped, lose all your mana, or just get silenced.  Otherwise all I'd really change is to level up more dodging.  You could also just win the game at this point, instead of going to extended."

I want to find shatter, but didn't have any luck with it. I agree that rMut should be over rCorr, but keeping it uncursed will drastically reduce my stats and ability to cast stuff. Thing is I want to see hells and pan, maybe visit that ziggurat (which I won't do until I grab some OP spells to cast in my orange crystal plate armor... heh, but I think that won't be possible.

What makes you want to switch to Ash? Surely there's no incentive to using Throwing over M&F at this stage of the game, so all Ash would do for you is give you Scrying and help you cast Haste a little faster. TSO would be a better choice if you have a second demon whip to convert, although 15 runes with Trog is perfectly doable (easy, even) as well.  For future reference, maxing out your weapon skill is unnecessary. Once it's at min delay, you'll usually get more mileage out of raising fighting and dodging. You really, really need to start training dodging to ~20, I'm not sure why you've left it at 2 for so long."

Remember the base type of a weapon is as important as its enchantment value. So a weapon with poor base damage (dagger) is worse than a weapon with okay base value (flail) even after enchantments are added.  In general, all short blades have low base damage, and while not impossible to win with one, its generally better to use a real weapon if you can. End-game goal for a GrFiOka is a +9 great mace with either flaming, freezing, crushing, antimagic or holy brands (only holy if going extended, and antimagic is better for this anyway)."

Dex vs. Str is a question of EV. When wearing heavy armour, your EV is penalised based on your strength. It never goes away, but there becomes a point when levelling up more str has minimal effect on your EV. If your strength is ~20, and you're wearing something heavy like plate armour, then you need 3-4 strength to gain back a single point of EV.  Instead you can level up dex, put XP into dodging (which every character should be doing), and gain EV that way. Its more efficient in the long term (although I don't know the exact numbers, but probably closer to 1 dex = 1 EV)."

As for extended, why not clear depths then have a look in abyss and see how you fare?  Lets just say that the learning curve is again steep  in hells/pan and you have (from anecdotal data) maybe 40% of not dying.

For the rest, I would think about getting haste castable and probably branching into earth magic. Once you are skilled in earth and spam lrd and shatter, the earth staff definitely becomes a good choice (but not right now imo, vampiric is too good a brand when manfighting). With the innate partial torment resistance and the good elemental resistances you have, extended should be doable.  Your choice of spells looks a bit odd to me, what is the point of these high level 100% failure spells?"

I feel like the skills are too spread out (10 throwing & a bunch of various magic schools) to be fully cohesive, but if clearing depths & crypts gets you far enough in earth magic to have a good option against ranged casters (especially summoners) then extended should be doable.  Also the armor seems suspicious; seems like something better should be on offer. A ring mail of MR+ is pretty lackluster (Gr already has rElec). Quicksilver dragon armor, for example, would be flat out superior with no downside."

You also do not have a shield! For the low investment of 4 skills in shield you can wear a buckler.   You also are wielding a staff of energy? By vaults some other kind of enhancer staff that actually enhances your spellpower should have come by your way- with 20 spellcasting you dont need reduced hunger (but you might have been channeling which would have been.. maybe alright).   Note that the game has sharp tresholds of difficulty, lair end<branches<branch ends<vaults<depths, so it often will happen to me that a lazy uncautious playstyle gets a heavy damper, nearly dying upon entering  a new zone which I then have to adapt for.   I see you had cblink. If you still die with cblink online you are not good enough at identifying bad bad situations and getting out if your HP are at 50%. two Cblinks will almost always get you out of jail free, if started early enough.   Lastly you have not used ?enchant weapon/armour. That would have been two AC more on the boots, and might have in the course of the engagement given you that one extra turn.

I also got the staff of energy quite late so i had high spellcasting to lower the hunger on glaciate. Not sure if i simply overvalue spellcasting.  Transmutations i was training for lich form, i took beastly appendage as a cheap spell to enable me to train transmutations.  No shield was because i was using Condensation Shield and you cant use that with a shield equipped. Not sure if using an actual shield is a better option.  I did have some other staves, wizardy and conjurations. But i liked the mana channeling on staff of energy a lot. Having mana issues is usually my main problem.  Looking back on that character i made some huge mistakes, that death in vaults 5 actually happened after i already almost died twice there, and i still went back.

Training transmuations for lichform before even having done depths is... kinda really really bad. Why transmuations and not necromancy? Necro gives you at least some options instead of being totally dead xp.   Man I can see now why the experienced player say all the time to   remove Lichform just to avoid all these stupid deaths.

dcss,34z3u0,solovayy,5,Tue May 5 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"For the character you posted, the main question is whether you want to do 2-handed or 1-handed + shield.  For 1-handed, the Eveningstar is an end-game quality weapon, and should be enchanted to maximum (+9) ASAP. Min-delay for an Eveningstar is at skill 15, so you would want to train that skill heavily to that point. This does commit you to training shields as well (which is certainly not a bad thing), so if you've already put training into shields then it's an easier choice. On the other hand, if you've put training into a different supplementary skill like Evocations, it might be less attractive.  For 2-handed, you will need higher skill to reach mindelay, so you probably want to go with your highest weapon skill right now (polearms) because you're going to want to get a Glaive (hopefully even a Bardiche) to min-delay, which happens at skill 20 (or 26[!] for a Bardiche). It's not immediately clear that either of the Glaives you have is end-game quality, but if you're sure you're going to limit yourself to 3 runes, you could do worse than enchanting a Glaive of flaming.  If it were me, I'd go Eveningstar + shield. Eveningstars are very good, and not that common, and freezing is a desirable brand indeed.

If not, stick with polearms. The trident should get you through Orc, the glaives through Vaults:4 and maybe Depths. You'll probably stumble across a bardiche. Or maybe not. If you're tab happy, maybe mace and board are the way to go.  As for enchant scrolls, most of the time, I find enough to chant one weapon to +9 over the course of the game. You don't win any points for dying with them in your stash, though, so factor that into your decision.  Good luck. Post the morgue when you die."
dcss,34z3u0,BacchusReborn,3,Tue May 5 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"Crafting is effectively not a thing. Basically these are the extent of how you can modify items in crawl:   Scrolls of enchant weapon/armour to add +1   Maximum of +9 for weapons, +2 for aux armour, +3 for shields, +4 for barding, and base AC for body armour.  Scrolls of brand weapon will randomly brand or rebrand a weapon   You can't control the type, but you are guaranteed to get one that won't make your god mad, and you won't get distortion. If the weapon had a brand, it will definitely change to something else. This can be used to safely remove a distortion brand from a wielded weapon (this used to not be the case).  God gift brands:   Kiku will brand a weapon to pain for you (or give you Necronomicon) Lugonu will brand a weapon to distortion for you TSO will brand a weapon to holy for you    As a rule of thumb when you're deciding whether or not to use these permanent strategic resources, the best advice is usually ""do what benefits you now, instead of saving for later."" If you don't take advantage of all your resources, you may not get to experience ""later"", and enchant scrolls aren't that super rare. Furthermore, a +1 in the early game makes a bigger difference than it does in the late game. (Doing 11 damage instead of 10 is more significant than doing 31 damage instead of 30. Keep in mind the +X from enchantments happens after all other effects that improve your damage, like skill levels.)  That said, it's a rule of thumb, not a set-in-stone law. For armour, generally enchanting auxiliary armour is best if you're not likely to keep your current body armour (you're less likely to change aux armour). Characters who want to stay in low ER armour might be advised to save just one enchant armour scroll for the first good dragon hide they find, but they should still enchant aux armour with any others.  For weapons, often enchanting the best weapon you've access to right now is a solid plan for the above reasons, unless you know you'll be switching in the near future (for example, you're holding a better weapon and you just haven't switched because you need some more skill levels or something)."
dcss,34z3u0,WinterShine,2,Tue May 5 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"A minor thing: max enchantment level for shields and large shield was raised in 0.15 or 0.16 to +5 and +8, respectively."
dcss,34z3u0,GNG,0,Wed May 6 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"Hey so as a MiFi you dont need much more strength to wear any armors besides maybe crystal. Considering that you could put more into dex while using the spear. Dex is a good attribute for Mi because they need the accuracy boost for big weapons. But since its a spear you dont need that extra accuracy. So the strength and the dex arnt super important to your build.   Next theres the brand, flame is a good brand for a 3 rune run but still less powerful and less useable than electricity.  Rc is great but not very useful in a 3 rune unless you cant get it from anywhere else.   That -tele is a turn waster for a character that can get into tricky situations.  Id pick the flame rc trident. Cheers. Probably hold onto both though."
dcss,34z3u0,No_Name_James,2,Tue May 5 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Hey so as a MiFi you dont need much more strength to wear any armors besides maybe crystal. Considering that you could put more into dex while using the spear.    A spear is one of the worst base weapon types in the game.  Elec is a nice brand, good enough to make that spear a very solid early game weapon on a character not casting spells, but the trident and eveningstar both completely blow that spear out of the water even with the brand and stats.  You don't seem to be paying much attention to base weapon type in your post, instead focusing on brands and other stats, but base weapon type are by far the most important qualities of a weapon on a MiFi outside of the very early game (when a good brand like elec or venom can outweigh base damage and speed).   A spear is a terrible weapon, a trident is an okay one, an eveningstar is a fantastic one.    The brands, stats, and resistances aren't enough to change any of this (especially since flaming and freezing do the same damage against non-resistant enemies), and the eveninstar can be enchanted so the difference in enchant levels doesn't matter much in the long run (and with 6 or more enchant scrolls the eveningstar can have the highest enchantment level of the three anyway).  Basically, the eveningstar will do the most damage of any of the one-handed weapons here at min-delay, especially with some enchant weapon scrolls.  It's not even close.  +5 strength is downright pathetic compared to the increase in damage, and rC wouldn't be worth it either (I think the only place in the game where I might consider rC to be important enough to be worth using a weaker weapon is Cocytus if it's your only source of rC, but trying to do Cocytus with a +6 flaming trident as your only source of rC would be suicide anyway)."
dcss,350npx,Okiemurse,5,Wed May 6 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't bother with int as a MiFi. I'm not sure I understand the whole ""this game has to be a 15 rune"". Usually I check how a char is going around 3-5 runes before I consider whether or not he's strong enough for extended. Its certainly still a good game if you win without going there (and often a low-level zot can be a similar challenge anyway).  Ideally with a MiFi in extended, you'll want wands of haste, heal wounds, some form of teleport in plentiful supply. Lots of resists. A big two hander (triple sword) of anti-magic or holy wrath. Your weapon should be min-delay, and fighting/dodging/armour should be skilled high. Evocations/invocations are both pretty nice too. You can probably get some small spells online (like rMsl, regen, apportation, blink) but you'll probably have trouble getting something like haste online in both heavy armour and poor minotaur aptitudes.  I'm not sure that sword you've posted is that good, although I suppose its not bad for early game. Evocations is often a good way to deal with hydra threats if you have a slicing weapon, especially if you get some summons available. Running away is also a good option."
dcss,350npx,triorph,2,Wed May 6 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"I can relate to the urge to make every game 15 runes. Once you've already ascended once, you already know you can win the game. If your second game clears Zot:5, the hard part's done, and there isn't much question that you could easily leave at any time.  There's not really any advantage in giving up early than in pushing ahead and getting hellfired to death - either way, the game's over and you're going to the high score list. Might as well shoot for the stars and see how far you can get."
dcss,350npx,bigmcstrongmuscle,2,Wed May 6 13:32:21 2015 UTC,"Idk, I just want to go all or nothing, death or glory. 15 runes or dead on the floor and rolling a new dude until I finally get it. :)  the book of party tricks has a few excellent low level spells and that's what I was mainly going for with the int. Apportation and stuff. I will take your advice though and not put anything else into Int. What is better to supplement, Str or Dex? I'm figuring MiFis already have a ton of str and the dex may be a nice supplement.  edit: also, thank you for the advice! You have a couple great things in there for me to keep in mind."
dcss,350npx,karlwayne,2,Wed May 6 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert; so take my advice with a grain of salt.  I've found that spellcasting on a Minotaur is a bit difficult, especially if you plan on wearing heavy armour.  I'd look for some good evokables like a rod of clouds/shadows.  Getting anything high level online with that int and armour is not really an option.  A couple low level high utility spells should really be what you look for.  Ctrl-F for some boots.  Maybe there are none, but even a base boot is better than an empty slot.  The long sword is not worth it unless you have a decent shield to make use of the 11 points you spent.  I'd probably save the gold for Orc.  Sometimes you can hit it big in orc and having spent 700 quid on a quickly diminishing one hander is a complete waste.  Your resists need improvement, but you have plenty of time to look for better items.  As far as acquirement scrolls go I'd either go weapon, armour, or wand; depending on luck and Okawaru gifts (the amulet should help with that)."

I have enough cash to buy all 3, they're only 150 or so apiece, but I might just wait for something to drop.  The long sword isn't ideal, just wanted to post what else is out there.

dcss,350npx,bigmcstrongmuscle,2,Wed May 6 06:37:27 2015 UTC,"I recently ascended an axe-wielding Oka-->TSO MiFi as my first 15-runer. In a pretty good place to talk about this one.  Immediate advice:  You are going to want something with rPois yesterday. DEFINITELY make sure you have it before you set foot in Spider. You've got a couple remove curse scrolls, so use-ID some of your unknown rings and try to find rPois. Don't use up your last scroll, though, just in case of an emergency.  Ditch that amulet of faith, even if it's the only amulet you have. Now that your piety is maxed out, it's useless. The only reason you could possibly have to keep it equipped is the piety hit for removing it. If you ditch it quickly, before doing Orc, you should be able to use Finesse again by the time you hit Orc:4 (and speaking of that, you should focus Invo to 8-10 so you can actually use your god powers). Instead equip an amulet of Clarity or Warding if you have one.  Also leave the ring of ice at your stash. You are not an ice wizard, so the booster is useless to you, and your armor already has rC+. Maybe take it out again for Shoals, but rF- will be bad bad times in most other places. If you have anything else that won't do you any good while you explore, like your scrolls of amnesia, leave it at your stash.  You've got a lot of MR, which is nice. It looks like it hasn't come up yet, but you only really need MR+++. Maybe consider dropping down to three if it would net you some other sweet perk. rCorr is nice from that artifact hat, but I'm not sure wearing it is doing you much good at this stage of the game, especially considering it also has a Dex malus. Definitely hang on to it for Slime, Zot, and a couple of the Pan and Hell levels, though.  Decide now whether you want to continue putting points in Shield. 10 skill is a lot to let go to waste, but if you sink more points in and go two-handed later, you will be throwing good XP after bad. Don't throw anything else down that well unless you either are still actually using it, or find a great shield that you're sure you want to use in the endgame. If you aren't sure, stop training Shields for now and see if anything good comes up.  Get wands of fire, cold, and maybe draining. Also every throwing net you can find. They'll help if you do meet a big hydra. Maybe also carry around the biggest blunt weapon you can carry. There should be plenty lying around. You'll have 0 Skill for it, but you shouldn't really need any - your Fighting skill and Okawaru buff will get you some hits on their own. Your crossbow is worth something in a pinch, but my personal favorite answer to hydras is to open fire with attack wands while it closes, then (right when it reaches melee range) to throw a net and hammersmash it while it's helpless.  Mid-term:  If you couldn't find rPois right away, it should now be a top priority. You probably thought you needed it for Lair, but without rPois Spider will be an absolute hellhole that will burn through every potion you own. Spend your money on unided artifacts, cloaks, and rings in shops. Money is not rare (especially after you start Orc), and it's only useful if you spend it.  Flying will really really help for Shoals. Hoard your flight potions, and keep an eye out for a permanent source. If you find an evocable flight item, maybe train enough evo to get the fail rate somewhere usable. You almost certainly won't get the spell online in time, even if you get really lucky and find it ten turns from now.  Long term:  Your Str is pretty boss as is, but more Dex for more EV might be more useful for you. I definitely wouldn't bother raising Int any higher. If it tells you anything, in my first 15-rune ascension, my MiFi won with Int 6 and no spells above 3rd level. You can get pretty far using just god powers and consumables. It takes a looooong time for a heavily-armored minotaur to get magic anywhere close to usable, and let's be realistic here: most of the spells you'll really want are little gimmicks like Apportation, Blink, Swiftness, RMsl, Flight, and Summon Butterflies. Spellpower isn't a huge issue like it is for a battlemage. When you do want to get spells online, train up only the relevant spell schools to begin with. It'll be the most efficient use of your XP to reduce your fail rate.  Your armor is nice for this stage of the game, but you could do better for extended. Look for opportunities to upgrade to something nicer - crystal plate or dragon armor. In an extended game, you will almost certainly get a shot at GDA, and with your Str I think that's where I'd go.  Your weapons are okay for now but not great. You should almost certainly look for a better one. If you want in the meantime you can dump some enchant scrolls into the greatsword and rebrand it first chance you get, but eh. You'll see better soon. The artifact longsword you aren't carrying may arguably be useful in Spider, but will definitely be outclassed soon after that."
dcss,34zegb,qntl,3,Tue May 5 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"Even though you were wearing plate armour, training dodging would have helped your defenses a great deal. All that xp that went into shields should've gone into dodging. Deep dwarf even has a nice dodging apt of +1. 30/20 defenses would've felt a lot better I am certain. As you were using a 2h at the death I assume you were using 1h+shields for a while and switched. This is one reason not to train shields past what you need for a buckler (4-5), so that very little xp is wasted if you switch back to 2h. You started as fighter so I suppose you start with a shield, but actually training shields is probably a last priority for the reasons above.  Deep elf annihilators can do up to 102 damage with a single crystal spear, so treat them with the utmost respect, especially that early on. It's too bad you got two crystal spears in a row though. That is unfortunate."
dcss,34zegb,zxc223,1 point,Tue May 5 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"I also think that maybe XL16 is a bit early to be going to vaults, although this was a particularly unlucky death.

dcss,34xeh5,pindragon03,1 point,Tue May 5 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"If you're just going for runes, after you finish the Vaults you have several options, and none of them are easy. You could start by testing the waters of the first floor of Zot. However, if you meet an Orb of Fire and you don't have F+++, you should avoid it for now.  The Abyssal Rune is relatively safe compared to any of the 9 Hell or Pan runes, although still difficult to reach. You want to bring food and mutation resistance and be prepared to be there a while. You should read up on how the Abyss works too.  I would recommend putting off the Golden Rune(Tomb) as long as possible, the constant death curses, smites, and torments are very difficult to deal with, especially as a melee character.  EDIT: I've been informed that my information on corrosion is outdated. You can find better advice from the other posts on the Slime Pits.  If you're out of options you can always start to explore Pan, but it can greatly vary in difficulty from floor to floor. As long as you're ready to retreat at all times your character should be able to at least survive it.  To be honest, it looks like you're going without spells or teleporting, which is going to make getting more than 3 runes very difficult. You gave up Charms magic to Ru, which means you won't have access to Haste without a wand, and in general it's going to be rough. You can probably get a 3-rune win without too much more trouble, though."

Abyssal Rune is relatively easy to get, but also very low priority. You likely won't get much XP getting it nor will you get loot. It's nice to grab, but it's not going to change how easy the other branches are going to be so you don't need to do it first.  I think the most logical place to clear after Vaults is going to be Crypts and getting one of the weapon skills up (and leave the other behind). Right now he doesn't have the morningstar at min delay which should really be fixed (especially for electrocution brand). I'm not exactly sure why there was a transition to Mace and Fails, it came pretty late and you already had +4 long sword of slicing which is good enough to not need to switch even with a good morningstar drop.  I don't think Slimes is going to work on the character anytime soon, or at least I'd be really nervous about it. With horrible MR he's really vulnerable to Golden Eyes and Orb of Eyes which seems really dangerous when also dealing with mutations and corrosion. An amulet is only going to cover 1 of those three vulnerabilities."

You shouldn't enter Zot until you have a plan for dealing with them, as they can spawn shallower than Zot:5.  You did Depths before Vaults? Impressive! rCorr & rMut are advisable for Slime, which is the next easiest rune. Note that corrosion is only temporary. Also, technically don't need either resistance for Slime, or rMut for Abyss or Zot, but the latter is highly recommended. I've never taken a Deep Dwarf through Slime without rCorr, so I can't advise you on that count.  ""- Level 14.4 Long Blades   Level 14.8 Maces & Flails""   ??

It can be harder to get rolling than some gods, depending on what you find. If you don't start with a hat or buckler, you can be waiting a long time before you find one. You need more rings before you can really get the piety rolling, although there's almost no downside to immediately cursing any ring that's not actively terrible, because you have so many slots. Similar with hats and bucklers - you probably aren't going to find anything better than the first ones that you stumble on or start with for a while, so there's no downside to immediately cursing them.  It can be a while before you start getting much of a magic skill boost, because it takes more cursed jewelry before that kicks in. Even one cursed item will get item IDing and monster detection going fairly soon, though, and those are great. You have a much better chance of finding a decent weapon when you can try out almost anything that gets dropped.  I feel like you can be a bit more dependant on scrolls of remove curse showing up early. You are mostly cursing jewelry, and there's no guarantee Ash will give you those.

dcss,34tbtm,P4duke,4,Mon May 4 11:48:03 2015 UTC,"Spellcasting 12 is much too high, defenses are subpar, you trained two weapon classes to high levels. Tloc is probably for cblink, right? I'd have gotten more armour first. Remember next time you have cblink memorized at <50% failure, brilliance is your best friend and not ever going to be used for anything else.  Oka /Invo are okay with 10 or so I think for finesse, but thats really minor compared to spellcasting/two weapons."
dcss,34tbtm,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Mon May 4 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"I invested more than necessary in spellcasting because I wanted to improve my chance for both haste and cblink, as opposed to just one of them, but I guess you've got a valid point.   I had 2 weapon classes at high levels because of the fact that I didn't have more than 20 bolts until late midgame so I didn't want to risk getting stuck without ammunition, but yes probably putting points in fighting and using whatever weapon would've been more wise.  Also I didn't use Oka, but TSO... found at level 2 and decided to go with it"
dcss,34tbtm,Slogo,4,Mon May 4 13:47:30 2015 UTC,"If you're already training invocations the only thing spellcasting is going to do for you is give you more spell levels. In your case you had 21 spell levels extra so all those points in spellcasting are pretty much useless. Training the actual magic schools are way more efficient at getting spells online.  For hybrids especially you really should just focus on what spells do you need RIGHT NOW vs all the spells you ever want to cast. Having swiftness, deflect Missile and Haste Online is good enough to take you through the majority of the game and would have given you a lot more extra training to invest in other stuff.  Like you put all those points into magic schools... and you didn't cast any of the tloc and charm spells, which actually doesn't even really make that much sense. If you had focused on getting a single spell school online you would have had deflect missiles going and probably could have avoided the death to begin with. Even as it was you could have at least tried to haste once you noticed a dangerous situation (or used swiftness to run away).  Same with invocations really; you trained it up, but only used it 5 times and never made use of anything like divine shield which could have prevented you from going low hp in the first place."
dcss,34tbtm,Slogo,2,Mon May 4 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"About the last paragraph I like to think that those 5 times where I've summoned the angels saved my char. Also, doesn't Divine Shield need shield skills to be of any use?"
dcss,34tbtm,triorph,4,Mon May 4 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"Nope! SH, if I'm not mistaken, is very much like EV in that the value listed is what determines your block rate (among some other factors like having a decreased block chance if you have successfully blocked an attack that turn). Shield skill is merely there to get more SH per shield size and to mitigate penalties of equipping a shield.  For Divine shield you get a SH value determined by your invocations skill and it 'just works' without penalty because it's not an actual shield.  I didn't mean to imply that your usages went to waste, I just wanted to sort of highlight a thought process where you need to be sure what you spend skills on actually pays off to its fullest potential. The 5 summons are great, but you died at max piety and high invocation skill which means you effectively died with a big resource gone unspent. Meanwhile you had very few emergency potions and scrolls (though you did have a heal wounds potion you didn't try and use), but presumably had acquired at least a few more during your run. Perhaps more liberal management of your god powers could have traded a renewable resource (piety) for one that's limited (scrolls of blinking) and given you a good out against what ultimately killed you."
dcss,34tbtm,Slogo,2,Mon May 4 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"Spellcasting still improves your spell success rate and reduces spell hunger. Even with invocations built up, the per-level MP gain from spellcasting is higher than invocations, so you might end up with higher max MP. Not saying you're wrong about spellcasting being a bad choice, but there's more to it than just ""more spell levels""."
dcss,34tbtm,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Mon May 4 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"Right, I agree totally!  I meant specifically for melee-focused hybrids really. Hunger on charms/buffs/tLoc is usually not a big deal, even with haste you usually aren't casting it often enough to outdo food you get from corpses (except in a few later branches maybe). Charms (and other buffs) also largely don't need a big mana pool either. Plus until you're comparing like 15 or 20 of a spell school to very low #s of spellcasting the spell school should lower success rate faster I believe."

dcss,34tntv,absurdperson,2,Mon May 4 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"I have a section in my rcfile (init file) which designates spells to certain letters. I copied it from another rcfile a long time ago and haven't made many adjustments since:  http://pastie.org/private/wfoc9qvei7h1gt5edb10oa  Most utility spells automatically go to letters I know beforehand when I learn them, like d for repel missiles, b for blink, B for cblink etc. This saves a lot of time and effort. Manual mapping of spells can be changed with =s.  On top of that, what I do is use macros to cast my most common spells - the zxcvyuiop ones (in my case). I use the numpad for movement, so what I've done is made macros of -+*/ on the numpad to cast zxcv. To do this, press: ~m-Zz . Then when I want to cast spells like ensorcelled hibernation or magic dart, I hit -, and adjust targets with + or - if needed, and hit spacebar to cast. I have my 1234 keys bound to the yuio spells as well, and I use F1-F4 for different things each game, such as Sif's channeling or sublimate blood.  Not related to macros, but one thing I've started doing is mapping certain jewellery to letters that make sense. For instance, f for rF+, c for rC+, r for regen, p for protection, and so on. To do this just press =i and map the item in question. I find this saves some time over the course of the game, especially since I jewellery swap a lot.  Another thing I do is autoinscribe items like ID scrolls, tele scrolls and wands, etc. If I want to read ID, I just press r1. Remove curse is r2 for me. Saves some time and effort.

Realistically, the only spells you need for awhile are Animate Skeleton and Pain to help deal with hydras. Ghoul UC will carry you through Lair, and after that you can consider dumping more points into Necromancy to get Animate Dead and Agony.

Your MR+++++ will block Eresh's paralysis cast as well.  Tactic #1 looks best to me. Haste, brilliance if you like, and start firestorming at range. If you get silenced, you're still hasted and can back off. Learn apportation. If you have the opportunity, just apport runes and leave - it's much simpler.  People almost always do pan before hell. You could go and do pan before Tar. Control tele (via evocable or spell) is extremely good in pan, as well as controlled blink, and apportation. As for abyss, that's often done as a 4th or 5th rune. I recommend doing abyss, pan, and then Tar. Be sure to learn apportation. Consider wearing a fire ring to enhance firestorm further.

There's no shame in running or not engaging an enemy in this game, and for your character orb spiders could do huge chunks of damage.

Be careful vs TRJ.  3)  if you have rN+++, sustain abilities, and a good holy wrath weapon , you might even consider tome.  Remember Gr resist torment and rot, and stair dancing does work.

Hexes for fear alone is not really a good option, you will have trouble getting spellpower. If you get invisibility its another game.   For now, go vaults, due to the compartementalized (is that even a real word??) nature of vaults its easy to run around and find sleeping stuff. Just pop teleport/evocables early if you get locked in by a warden.   Dangerous monsters to melee in V: vault guards and wardens, deep trolls."
dcss,34ha32,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Fri May 1 10:53:02 2015 UTC,"Nice name!  Pretty unlucky on the books. I think Ru isn't great for stabbers for pretty much this reason; although his powers are strong, you can't use them repeatedly in a sustained fight, so they're not a good crutch for low damage characters.  First thing, get sblades to 14, that's rapier min delay. I think your plan is good, I would hit up Elf:1-2 and see if you get lucky with shops, but I would almost never do Elf:3 on a spriggan without Silence or something equally powerful. Beyond that, there isn't much you can do besides doing V:1-4, Depths, and V:5, hoping to pick up some useful spells or rods along the way. If not, you'll probably want to get Iron Shot reliable as a last resort, but it's not going to help you in the short term IMO."

At first I was able to apoc toughies like hydras, but now it only takes tough monsters to 1/2 HP which isn't really enough."

dcss,34giga,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:39:27 2015 UTC,Should I be using the vampiric morningstar over the (very slightly more enchanted) poison eveningstar?  I wasn't sure about the tradeoff re: damage output.  There is a mundane morningstar of holy wrath back in Elf:2.  I don't think I understand the strength/encumbrance mechanics.  How do I know when I have enough strength/armour skill for a particular piece of armour?  Is it just when strength is greater than or equal to the encumbrance rating?
dcss,34giga,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Thu Apr 30 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should be using the vamp against living targets. You will swing a bit more often since less damage but will heal up all the same and are thus not only safer but you also reduce rest times significantly, and thus even gaining more piety!  Since you are nearly finished with the game, feel free to swap out against any nonliving enemies (liches, OoF, curse skulls) and just eating permafood all the time.   I'd grab that holy wrath morningstar for Aliches and the orb run. Any Freezing/Bashing morningstars around for OoF?   Encumbrance: as rule of thumb have at least the encumbrance rating, better is 1-2 points more. This is even more important when casting spells; your character ""just"" has bad dodging."

dcss,34giga,Quazifuji,3,Thu Apr 30 23:56:24 2015 UTC,"Thats unfortunate. Evocations is a great skill but only having wands to use it with doesn't make it so useful.  If there is anything you can do about Frail II (potion of cure mutation) then you should use it. Getting back that missing 20% will be a welcome boost to your survivability, worth more than curing whatever mutations you might have afterwards. Speaking of which, you may want to look for an amulet of resist mutation, for orbs of fire.  That artifact ring provides rF, rC, and rN, and you only lose 4 str. I would gladly put it on; you have strength to spare, and you'll barely feel the loss."
dcss,34giga,Slogo,2,Fri May 1 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"Looks ready to tackle Zot.  I'd switch from training evoc to training dodging and armour, they're both very low (in general, but especially for a minotaur in crystal plate) and you'll probably benefit from them more.  I'd also probably wear the EV or rPois ring while exploring and only put the rF ring on when you see and Orb of Fire and when you're doing the Zot 5 Vault - outside of Zot 5, OoFs aren't very common and rF is plenty for everything else, while poison cloud damage can add up quickly with no rPois and EV is useful against everything.  With no rElec or rC, you're gonna have to be careful with Ancient Liches and Electric Golems, and no rMut will make OoFs more painful than average (and I see you've already had some bad run-ins with mutators), but I don't know if there's anything I'd recommend that's more useful than dangerous.  Basically, you're ready to tackle Zot if you play smart and carefully, but you're certainly not at the super-powerful tab-through-almost everything point.  Go for it, but be smart.  The one thing I might consider doing first, but it's still not risk free, is doing the first few floors of a Zig.  Cure mutation potions are very common in Zigs, and getting rid of your mutations (and ideally, having a few potions to spare in case of unlucky run-ins with OoFs) would help quite a lot, and the early floors of Zigs are usually pretty easy.  There's also a good chance of other useful stuff like elemental evokers or potions of experience (which I would recommend using to boost your armour and dodging skills, but Evocations or Invocations could also be useful).  On the other hand, while the first few floors of a Zig are pretty easy, it's still definitely possible to get unlucky, make a mistake, or just go a little bit too far, so while I don't think doing a bit of a Zig would be a bad idea, I'm not gonna give it my complete, unqualified recommendation either.  It might give you great stuff and improve your chances of surviving Zot, but it could also burn a bunch of consumables and piety or straight up kill you if you mess up or get super unlucky."
dcss,34giga,Quazifuji,2,Thu Apr 30 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"He does have the resistance on reaction for cold and fire from qazlal, but it would be ideal to have at least 1 rank rF and rC."
dcss,34giga,Slogo,2,Fri May 1 01:27:40 2015 UTC,"Forgot about that.  Can't Qazlal give rElec too?  That would help a lot.  Having at least one rank in rF isn't a problem for him, and that's by far the most important resistance for Zot (the only resistance in the game that I might consider mandatory and not just recommended, maybe along rC for Coc but that whole area's optional).  Qazlal's protection helps a lot against Ancient Liches and Electric Golems, although they should still be treated as extremely dangerous.  With Qazlal I would definitely say rPois or EV+2 is the way to go.  rPois is generally one of the less important resistances, but the poison clouds of poison from green draconians and gold dragons can still add up extremely quickly if you're not careful.  Although curing potions also help, obviously."
dcss,34giga,Quazifuji,2,Fri May 1 03:08:21 2015 UTC,"Qazlal can, though it's not as useful as rF or rC in a sense. rF and rC are nice because rank 1 (or 2) are 'good enough' a lot of the time, but an extra rank still helps a ton. The resistance isn't something you really want to rely on. Plus you aren't guaranteed an order so you may get hit by something then take a lightning blast while already low hp."
dcss,34giga,Slogo,3,Fri May 1 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point in general, but in the particular case of a character going into Zot with no rElec, Qazlal makes electric golems go from ""incredibly dangerous"" to ""fairly dangerous"".  It's better to not rely on it if possible, and rC and rF have the benefit of being useful even when you're not relying on them while with rElec you're either relying on it or it does nothing, but in the context of the OP's character, Qazlal resistances will be very useful against EGolems."

dcss,349dj8,triorph,2,Wed Apr 29 10:27:00 2015 UTC,"Your question is a bit confusing in the last line. The idea with Fedhas is basically to make a couple mushrooms at the first opportunity, and then use them to kill/not be killed by whatever dangerous things you run into. If you get Fedhas to * piety and get a couple mushrooms up, then you've basically punched your ticket to Lair. (And, while no longer the instant win they were earlier, they remain valuable for a long while after.)  The only way I could see Ce changing that is that you'll travel faster than your mushrooms by default. I don't know offhand whether this is overall a good strategy, but you can press Ctrl-E to switch your travel speed between ""full speed"" and ""speed of my slowest ally."" This only affects travelling, that is, shift-movement, map movement, and auto-explore. It doesn't affect movement from arrow/vi-keys (in particular, it doesn't affect moving in a fight). Just don't forget you have it on if you're shift-moving away from an enemy you've LOS'd by a wall or something I guess.  Also, I'm going to post my most common advice again, which is it's better to pick an early god than wait for a specific one. If you really want to play Fedhas that's fine, of course, but Fedhas isn't nearly as good of a choice on D:8 as it is on D:3. It's still a strong 3-rune god, but Fedhas' biggest advantage is that almost guaranteed free pass through the early game."

(1) Hit Dice; essentially a monster's experience level. Affects a monster's: magic resistance, spell power, experience value, forms it can polymorph into, and susceptibility to some spells such as mephitic cloud and confusing touch.      (2) Monster melee to hit is 18+HD*(1.5 or 2.5). The former for non-fighters, the latter for fighters. Beam to hit is 12*HD.      (3) More or less comprehensive list of effects: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?p=181800#p181800   In general I'd say it is not worth it for a Fedhas worshipper to get more Invo than is necessary to use their abilities with low failure rates. To specifically answer your question, the above seems to imply that it would improve melee accuracy, but not damage. I suppose the improved chance to hit comes with an improved chance to get a confuse off, but I doubt that's particularly worth levelling invo for, since they become relatively obsolete in the late game."
dcss,349dj8,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"I am very late for this discussion, but invocations on Fedhas is really strong, it increases hp of your allies, damage/accuracy, increases the amount of water/plants Rain will make, and, the most important thing, it increases the oklob plants attack speed, which is a huge deal. If you think Fedhas is a weak god after lair, you probably aren't pumping invocations high enough. If you don't believe me, just wiz mode, create a wandering mushroom/plant/oklob plant and use x to aim and D on the creature you made at different invocations skill so you can tell the difference."

dcss,3489fm,qntl,3,Wed Apr 29 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"The only runes you ever really want to consider for a third rune are Silver, Abyssal and Slimy. It used to be that the occasional character would go for Golden, but these days I think it's just too dangerous.  Abyssal you're familiar with. Doing it without Lugonu is basically the same as doing it with, except that it'll take longer and you don't get the get-out-of-jail-free card. For Abyss you want regeneration, and ideally lots of teleportation (a ring of teleporting is ideal here). rMut is nice, but not super important. Expect it to be pretty much the same as it was last time, except you will probably have to be there for longer.  Slimy is good if you can manage to take down the Royal Jelly. If you can reliably take it down, it's often safer than Vaults (if only because you can't get locked in by an inopportune Vault Warden). For this you need rCorr and rC (because of azure jellies). Having rMut (or a bunch of cureMut) is probably more important here than in Abyss unless you have the means to quickly take out golden shining eyes at range. The idea is dive to Slime:6 (there's no loot in Slime except for the treasure vaults at the end), clear out the area around the outside, and kill the Royal Jelly after the rest of the level is reasonably safe. (Qazlal may make this impossible, of course.) Because it spawns other slimes when you hit it, and they often get between you and TRJ, having a means to damage something not adjacent to you can be nice. Haven't played with Qazlal much myself, but I have to imagine Disaster Area counts lol."
dcss,3489fm,WinterShine,3,Wed Apr 29 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"If you are playing trunk,  rings of tele don't work in the abyss any more,  jfyi."

dcss,3489fm,sadger,2,Thu Apr 30 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"I should clarify, they no longer randomly teleport you (the passive random teleport doesn't happen any longer) so you can't simply slip on a ring and keep running. You can still evoke rings of tele to cause the normal delayed-teleport effect that happens in the abyss (just like reading a scroll or zapping a wand)"
dcss,3489fm,Stiegurt,2,Tue May 5 06:27:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, good to know. I guess they were pretty abusable there."
dcss,3489fm,WinterShine,3,Wed Apr 29 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"Qaz makes Slime pretty easily actually. You get a ""free"" rC rank vs azures (note this doesn't substitute for the 1st or even 2nd rank of rC, just makes them do even less dmg when fighting them). You can also smite any shining eyes to mostly avoid mutation. The smite aoe targeting vs The Royal Jelly also helps you clean up any small jellies spawning around TRJ and makes the fight more manageable.  That said Qazlal also really makes V5 doable as well if you have the invocations for it since you can disaster area to clear the entrance decently.  I did the immolation + Disaster area for the entrance with a char, I don't know how I feel about it. The 'problem' is it uh works but um... too well. You basically blow up everything instantly and that's great, but you spend a chunk of piety blowing up trash when the real threat is the fact that most of V:5 will collapse on you.   This isn't as bad as it sounds. It's pretty much standard operating procedure for Qazlal characters. You have the tools to deal with it with the god powers. Anything that's a threat at range just blast apart with Upheaval, everything else you can probably melee because you're a beefy MiFi.  What I would probably do is clear Elves while training Invocations up and nothing else. Everything else you have is high enough, but you need/want more invocations. Honestly i'd just train it up until like 20-25 at this point.  Then go back and clear V:5 (or slime). You can disaster area the first wave (don't really need to bother with immolation, though you can). If monsters stream in slowly fight them piecemeal until you get a big audience for a 2nd disaster wave. Any wardens that show up you can work on with upheaval. What you can do, if you really need to, is just blast things until your piety drops then retreat and go clear some of crypts to gain back the missing piety then come back.  Also don't underestimate upheaval. You haven't used it once all game, which is great and amazing if you've never been in danger, but otherwise you really should be using it in any situation remotely dangerous. Even just blasting out summoners or mages with it is really useful and will keep you from ever being in danger."
dcss,3489fm,Slogo,2,Wed Apr 29 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips.  After reading your answer I equipped some things to get rCorrosion and rC+++ and went through slime a bit.

dcss,34628t,LipsAre,8,Tue Apr 28 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"Ash is my favorite god(dess). You say ""besides Scrying"", but Scrying is an incredible ability which can be spammed pretty freely throughout the game, meaning you're never taken by surprise. It's especially useful on stabbers and summoners, but all characters can take advantage.  The other big thing you get from Ash is an early boost to your skills, most notably magic schools. Since the bonus is flat, it lets you train up a lot of skills to a reasonable level quickly, which is especially good for hybrid characters, and especially if you happen to have weak aptitudes for the type of magic you're trying to cast.  Being bound is not much of a relevant drawback as long as you do it intelligently and don't waste scrolls. The most important slot is jewelry, and for the early game, you can just curse up any random rings you find and wear them until Vaults.  TLDR: Works for most any build, allows fighters to cast low-level magic easily, allows mages to branch into melee earlier. Best with stabbers, summoners, necromancers."
dcss,34628t,CelerityDesu,6,Tue Apr 28 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"Adding to this. Ash is my favourite god(dess) as well, 13 of 22 wins with her/him. Be aware in trunk they swapped abilities around, scrying and skill boost which is a bit of a nerf, but still plenty good.   One thing I think is awesome about ash is the skill transfer. I find stealthy starts to be easy, so you train up short blades to 12. Then in lair you fight Maud and she has an evening star or double sword, boom you transfer skill points and now have a stellar weapon.   Most notable example are norris and rupert who sometimes have vampiric battleaxes...  Also as we all know the higher a skill level is the more expansive it gets, right? So Ash gives you a boost of +3 to your high level skills (more at lower levels); you only need to train a skill to 24 to get effective level 27. Allows 3-4 maxed out skills in a 3rune game on medium apts."
dcss,34628t,SvalbardCaretaker,6,Tue Apr 28 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"I am not a veteran by any means and have only worshiped Ashenzari once. I can say, though, that I was surprised how intense the benefits were. Had I had more scrolls of remove curse to corrupt (That run had only... 6 or 7, maybe, by the time I died in the spider cave (Ninja edit: the death was a YASD, I released a ton of wasps into the open with no poison resist, I had no business dying where I did, my fault entirely)) it would have been even better. Ashenzari seems, as far as I can tell, to reward careful planning by giving you better tools to plan with. Scrolls of identify barely ever need to be used on items, because most items fully identify instantly, and the ones that don't you still know whether or not they're cursed. The scrying is useful in all situations for planning and knowing when enemies are near doors. But the most dramatic thing for me was the skill boosts. If you bind your jewelry, you get magic boosts. Armor? More dodge, stealth, or armor skill based on armor type. Bind your weapon? It becomes immensely stronger due to the skill boost. And I didn't even get to the point where I could move around skill points, had I gotten an insane artifact that would have begged me to switch, I'd have had no reason not to switch. I was scared at first, and the god's not easy, because you really can't do equipment swaps whenever you feel like it. You've got to plan them. But the benefits, like most other gods, are so totally worth it."
dcss,34628t,GivenFlesh,5,Tue Apr 28 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"Ashenzari is an extremely powerful god. While some of the gods are designed to give you ways out of bad situations, Ashenzari is designed around preventing bad scenarios from happening in the first place. Skilled tactical play along with scrying and just the passive sensing of monsters and their threat levels means that you can avoid conflicts that you don't want to be in, and can optimally position yourself for fights you choose to partake in. And all that is in addition to the skill boosts and other perks that Ashenzari offers.  I will, however, say that Ashenzari requires a more skilled player to take full advantage of. Once you're in a bad situation, Ashenzari isn't better at getting out of it than gods that grant protecting abilities (like Zin or Dith) or destructive power (like Qazlal or Lugonu) or allies (like Makhleb or Trog). As such, Ash won't be as powerful in the hands of a player insufficiently experienced to take advantage of sensing and scrying in order to avoid getting into those dangerous situations."
dcss,34628t,WinterShine,4,Wed Apr 29 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a cool trick you can do with Ash.  You get a manual, and it doesn't matter what it is.  You train that skill until the manual is out.  Then you can shunt the exp to a skill that you do want, and it's like training the skill that you do want with +4 bonus aptitude.  Someone in ##crawl also mentioned that Ash is basically like having Okawaru's Heroic ability on all the time.  That really is powerful when you look at it that way.  No, Ash is really quite awesome, but not obviously so like Qazlal, for example."

dcss,344xkp,cybersaint2k,2,Tue Apr 28 12:50:36 2015 UTC,"rF++ isn't really needed for Zot, at least as a blaster. rF+ and rElec are sufficient. But it seems that you have rF++ with just the ring and your mutations anyway, so no worries there.  However, if you're planning to fight OoF with Iron Shot (a relatively slow option) as a DE, you NEED haste. Otherwise, you need a spell that kills them a bit quicker (LCS/Glaciate) or high-level summons. If you don't have access to any of those, you could probably do Slime, or scum non-unique Pan floors until you find something.  Zot:5 will be doable without access to haste or level 8 spells, but you'll need a little bit of luck and a solid understandings of tactics. Unlearn Bolt of Fire (so that your servitor won't cast it), check for respawns frequently, and play like your life is on the line. But I would recommend going elsewhere instead.  Also, as a general advice, I think you should spend more time training defensive skills. I feel fighting and dodging at 15 are a prerequisite for Depths, especially on a DE since you are so naturally frail. I often train only fighting on my casters at this stage in the game."

After reflecting on what I said about Servitor, I think it shouldn't ever cast Bolt of Fire or Fireball if an OoF is the chosen target, so you may just want to unlearn Mystic Blast, which will make sure it only casts Orb of Destruction and Iron Shot - a pretty solid plan for killing OoF's. I am not totally sure about this, though."

As OP told you, though, Octopodes have no use for enchant armor apart from getting non artifact hats to +2 and possibly enchant shields (but with Ru you're going to sac a tentacle as soon as you have the chance, so...).  On a tank (most notably a Gr) your AC is going to be high whether you spend the scrolls or not, but max enchanting auxiliary armor is still a very good idea, I believe."

If you're going to wear light armor you should probably burn through most of them as you get them (well on something reasonable like a branded robe or whatever). Most light armor doesn't take much to get fully enchanted, but going from something like 6->8 AC can save your skin.  If you're planning on wearing crystal or GDA it's probably a good idea to save a lot of the scrolls. +12 GDA is a force to be reckoned with and if you're already sitting on decent AC because of whatever other heavy armor you're currently wearing the few scrolls you'd spend on AC now probably aren't going to make a difference."

I would recommend grabbing dragon form as it gives you more damage output than statue form and isn't burdened by the speed penalty.  I recommend evocables because you can grab 1 of each evocable and then pick up any decks ornate or better for use in emergencies. Particularly effective are decks of changing, wonders and defense, which can all carry extremely useful cards like alchemist and elixir for healing, tomb as a panic button, and helm for defense, among others. I like to save ID scrolls for legendary or ornate decks so I know what card I'm pulling.

AC protects against almost all damage, including elemental damage, and is generally the best defensive stat, except for RF when dealing with Orbs of Fire.  The +6 ring of protection should be worn now and rarely, if ever taken off. You don't need RN+ unless you run into something that torments. Which is highly unlikely for the rest of the game.  Slings are currently at mindelay, so stop training them.  You don't have a shield, and you are using a one-handed weapon. Fix that problem by either picking up and wielding the biggest two-hander available, or by starting to wear a shield."
dcss,341hjt,DicemanCometh,2,Mon Apr 27 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"That dagger is going to be hitting it's shelf life soon. I can appreciate you're using it to deal with the rC malus on the leather armor, but be aware. I see you've landed some quick blade hits - you're definetely going to want to stick with qblades if you want to be a short blade berserker through extended. (But remember - part of the appeal of doing short blades is that they don't take much exp investment - swapping into another weapon class from sblades is more reasonable than most weapon type swaps).  You should stop training armour, it doesn't do much in that light stuff you're wear. Conversely, you really need some stealth. Not for stabs, just for general safety and ESPECIALLY in case you get Abyssed.  Your walking around rings should probably be +6 protection and rF. Spirit is definitely the right amulet choice.  You should be putting your level ups into DEX.  I like the sling training, that's a smart move.   Also remember you're hitting the point of the game where you should very rarely berserk, if at all. That no scrolls/potions is about to be a lot bigger of a drawback than the benefit.  I think I would do Swamp before Spider on this guy."

Survival as a wizard isn't going to come from +1 EV, it's going to come from tactical use of the spells you have available, especially Blink, Call Imp and Conjure Flame.  Speaking of which, don't skip Call Imp. It's not a strong summon, sure, but it's a summon, and that means you can use it, for example, to put something between you and an enemy in a corridor, which is handy even after conjure flame for those enemies that are willing to walk through fire. Even if they one-shot your imp, you've still gained a space between you and the enemy, which means you can walk to the stairs.  It's not also a great idea to just wait on Veh, Sif or a book. They might appear very late or in vaults you can't easily traverse. What you need in the early game is a god that will keep you alive until you've got something (whether it's melee or more magic) online that can protect you. As such gods that grant powerful early abilities are your bread and butter:  Fedhas - Mushrooms will win the early game for you Kiku - You're likely to get animate skeleton or raise dead Yre - Gives you animate dead as an invocation Oka - +5 to all melee and defence abilities means you can transition to a weapon much more quickly and safely. Makh - Minor destruction is better than what you have, but mainly it's the lesser summon you're interested in.  Of course, if you find Vehumet or Sif Muna early, or if you find a book with some mid level conjurations to transition to, you should absolutely feel free to spec into them instead. DCSS is a game all about adapting to what the game gives you instead of having a plan from the start, and Wz is a background that really needs that."
dcss,33ya3v,WinterShine,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:22:24 2015 UTC,Veh should be fine really. Until you start encountering a lot of poison resistant monsters that are durable Meph Cloud is pretty reliable and Magic darts can take out most of the poison immune stuff without trouble. Veh is almost always going to give you at least a level 3 conjuration spell by that point and any one should be good enough to keep progressing to the point of getting a book or a spell you really want.
dcss,33ya3v,Slogo,2,Mon Apr 27 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying Veh is a bad choice at all. I'm just suggesting that one's odds of surviving with a given character are better if one picks an early good altar rather than holding out for a late good altar. Vehumet isn't so much better than other choices that it's worthwhile to wait. At best Vehumet is on par with them.

If you do carry one it's worth knowing that you can quiver and throw them instead of trying to maneuver an enemy on top of them.  As an unrelated tip, there are also a fair number of vaults that generate a spellbook directly under an enemy - mostly statues but there's a Sif Muna altar vault  that forces an orc wizard to stand on one.

dcss,33okzb,WinterShine,4,Fri Apr 24 06:41:09 2015 UTC,"Just for clarity's sake, since Siniroth wasn't entirely wrong about hydra behaviour (though was wrong about what happened here), what Svalbard listed are ways that a monster can get multiple actions per player turn (which is how the hydra moved and attacked in a 10 aut time frame). Some enemies have multiple attacks per action, hydra being an example, getting one 18 damage swing per head.  For example, if you look up fire dragon in the LookupDB, you see that it has ""Dam: 20, 13, 13(trample)."" If it takes an action to attack you, it attempts to make all three types of attacks (presumably it's a 20 dmg bite, a 13 dmg claw, and then a 13 dmg trample, or something similar).  This can be somewhat relevant because multiple weaker attacks are more easily negated by AC than individual powerful attacks.  This is the same manner in which players can get multiple attacks per action by having auxiliary attacks through mutations or offhand punches. (You attack once, but in the log you see both the weapon attack and a tail slap, so you got two attacks for that one action.)"

dcss,33okzb,Bloodsparce,2,Fri Apr 24 06:56:59 2015 UTC,Good luck fighting a hydra in water if you had to run from it in the first place (unless you're not hampered by water).
dcss,33okzb,Eptagon,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's a rather common place scenario in Swamp. That means moving diagonally to dodge water pools or flying over them to walk away from an hydra is not an option, in that branch.  I don't see your point here."
dcss,33okzb,absurdperson,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:37:08 2015 UTC,I think his point is just that a hydra closes to melee much faster over water than ground. Obviously this reduces your tactical options and you are likely to end up fighting it in a less-than ideal situation. So good luck. It's not a great point and it's kind of off topic but there it is anyway. And I agree with it.
dcss,33nk77,karlwayne17,6,Thu Apr 23 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"Sprint is one of my favorite parts of the game.  If you look at the post I made for my first win there's some good advice.  I thought I also made a victory post for The Pits, which was the first one I beat, but I can't find it now.  I found that to be the easiest and least complicated map.  It's important in Sprint to max out your potential and hit as hard as you can as fast as possible, since the maps are more ""unfair"" or unbalanced than the main game.  Sometimes you'll just get an easy start and blast through, sometimes you'll get destroyed.  I'm still pretty bad at running away from fights and sneaking runes, but I imagine there are a ton of shortcuts and tricks for the crafty players to exploit.  I was having a really hard time with Red Sonja until I realized I could just blink over into the Orb chamber from the frost giant room and blink right out, which skips the second half of the map that I had been slowly puzzling my way through.  EDIT: I won The Pits with a MiFi of Chei.  The Pits is fun because the start is relatively fair, the first couple of rooms on the left play out like a familiar but fun puzzle each time you restart.  After the first segment your character is already fairly high-level and skilled, so you can experiment with different mid-game strategies when you get to the larger rooms.  Chei is overpowered in Sprint since you skill/piety/stat up super fast and can spam Slouch and mop up whatever's still standing, but Sprint is not as gentlemanly as the main game..  Ziggurat Sprint is also really fun.  It can be a huge pain in the buns because you spend five minutes gearing up only to sometimes get annihilated in the first room, but as long as you survive that you should be able to power up fast.  ZigSprint becomes all about Area of Effect attacks, evocable items, whatever can deal with the masses of enemies that you'll face.  I think I went with Qazlal for that one, but he's a lot like Chei when it comes to Sprint."
dcss,33nk77,Piginabag,6,Fri Apr 24 00:15:29 2015 UTC,"since the maps are more ""unfair""   be me, doing line sprint as octopode tentacle slapper  clear first door enemies, get level 2  kill second door of enemies, still level 2  get to room full of altars and items! aw yiss. ezmode now  open next door to more enemies - hill giant. I am still level 2"
dcss,33nk77,SvalbardCaretaker,4,Fri Apr 24 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I have won all the sprints except meatsprint, some multiple times. After that it loses a lot of its replay value.  Spriggan are fine, though as usual squishy and can run into food problems. For any magic-oriented build I find Sif Muna almost a necessity, only her limitless Wisdom and access to her Grand Library(tm) allow for the flexibility and power to stem the hard progression of difficulty.  And, well.. .Some of the sprints are basically only possible if one is spoilered, so expect a few horrible deaths."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,3,Fri Apr 24 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"The first couple are very puzzle like in that respect - you learn by dying, so if you just expect a lot of horrible deaths, you'll get the initial sequence down to a science after a thousand restarts...."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,4,Fri Apr 24 06:27:09 2015 UTC,"I love Sprint. It's like distilled Crawl, and great for when I don't have the time or attention span for a full game. I've also won all of them except Meatsprint (has anyone?), although I've at times had the high score by exploiting Formicids digging capability.  I find Fedhas to be the hardest, just because I can't imagine how you'd deal with it as anything but a stabber, and bad luck means instant death pretty much all the way through.  Zig sprint is the one I go back to the most, because it's fun to play with gear and builds you'd never mess with in a regular game. It lets you discover things like no matter how cool it seems, the Dark Maul is just terrible."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,6,Fri Apr 24 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"Winning tactics? (as best as I can remember)  Red Sonja - SpEn is definitely fun since you can get Stealth up quickly. It's fairly unique in that you arent sure to have all the gods available, so sometimes that can be a monkey wrench. Lucky blinks and/or stabs have helped skip some of the worst enemies at the end and ninja out the orb...  Menkaure: I enjoy Merfolk Berserker on this one; lots of water to exploit.  Ten Rune challenge: This one is grueling, but leaves a lot of flexibility in terms of how you can complete it. I've done it with fighters and casters, and I think most recently with a formicid fighter of qazlal? It's definitely the most 'Crawl in a nutshell' one.  Fehas: SpEn of Dithmenos is the only thing I've ever won with. Anything else, I get spritzed by oklobs and instakilled almost immediately, even when invisible.  Zig sprint: Too much fun, except when you get a Pan lord in the first room, or a late room full of uniques. If you're having trouble finding me in that shot, it's because I'm behind Cerebov. That's -after- killing half of them.  It's hard to get a caster going, but it can be really fun if you do. Singularity, Glaciate, Firestorm, anything crowd control oriented. Qazlal and Ru based fighters dominate easily.  Thunderdome - This one's pretty tough. I won it as a Gargoyle Hunter of Trog, spamming javelins like there's no tomorrow. I generally buy the Troll Leather Armour first thing regardless of who I'm playing.  The Pits - this is a good 'mini-Crawl' too. I've won this one as a MiFi of TSO, a SpEn, and I think a Gargoyle Gladiator of Chei.  Meatsprint - Is just retarded. It's momentarily fun, but nothing about your class or race matters. As a Formicid you can dig in and hide, but they'll eventually dig you out and swarm you, or you can starve to death and get a high score. Yay?  Linesprint - Centaur Hunter of Trog... shoot arrows, run away, repeat."
dcss,33nk77,Slogo,4,Fri Apr 24 06:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think meatsprint race matters. Ghouls seem to fare the best because they avoid the torment that comes out later and have good stats. Dodging is more important than ac and you 1 shot everything anyways so just pump Dex and try to nab the rings on the edge over the slaying bonus rings. At least with ghoul I've gotten the meatlord to spawn.  Demonspawn would do well if you get the right mutations.  Do any of the sprints have spell books? I keep wanted to use them to play around with things like dragon form, but I've never seen a dropped book in them."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,2,Fri Apr 24 11:54:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, the same things in meatsprint that torment have Dispel Undead, which hurts just as bad. Your stats max so quickly that Axes -> Dodging -> Shield (if Formicid) often top out after the first swing. I think I even killed the meatlord once, pretty randomly, but I've never actually seen the orb. ""Fun"" fact: If you're touring the map as a Formicid, there's a big undiggable box near the bottom center that's a spawn zone with what I assume are a bunch of teleport traps in it.   I think all the Sprints have books and/or stores - I got pretty far in Fedhas' using Dragon Form one time."
dcss,33nk77,Slogo,5,Fri Apr 24 13:36:24 2015 UTC,"The hydras have Torment only. I think the guardian guys have Dispel undead, but they have smiting as well so you're taking dmg from them anyways.  Also there's the snakes later on that can really pile up poison damage, and some monsters that cause rotting and stat drain. Being a ghoul helps with 2/3 of those at least.  That said yeah Formicids seem fine too. I think them, ghouls, and surprising spriggans, seem to fair the best (spriggans have extra MR, crazy EV, and fast move speed to pick up the rings around the map, though they're really vulnerable to the smiting and poison)."
dcss,33nk77,Slogo,3,Fri Apr 24 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"Ok I played some more as a Ghoul Necromancer. Which sort of and sort of doesn't work. You can get a gap that lets you memorize animated dead which is pretty useful except liches eventually show up and ruin everything by animating all the corpses themselves. Still you can get one big meatshield of undead that will occasionally make moving around a bit easier. Though the downside is doing this means you don't get to nab of the rings around.  That said I did see and kill the meatlord. Once you do that he drops the orb right at your feet and you just need to pick it up. Making it from there to the exit is a whole different matter. At some point someone is going to slow you which makes moving very difficult (you can't do it unless you are at full hp with a gap of monsters so you don't get sliced up) and eventually when the molten gargoyles show up one will eventually confuse you and that's that.   I think I can do it with a bit more luck, I burned my blink scroll and haste potion a bit too early perhaps. If you can manage to keep those around running back to the stairs should be a lot easier.  Interestingly picking up the orb and killing the meatlord wasn't enough to get a high score."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,2,Fri Apr 24 14:49:42 2015 UTC,"Ha, see I didn't even notice the orb in the mess and then immediately died. The rings of slaying are pointless, since you have infinite/infinite attack/damage already. Sinv is critical for races that don't already have it, and the Rf can help reduce certain attacks a little.   There's a very heavy score per second survived thing going on, so digging in like a tick with a Formicid kind of breaks it."
dcss,33nk77,Slogo,4,Fri Apr 24 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah sInv is pretty important. rF too though I think that's secondary to getting sInv. At the same time it's pretty useful to stay near the middle so your run back is shorter and the spawning seems a little more forgiving there.  The necromancer (or any book start -> learn spell) is sort of gimmicky, but may actually be pretty reasonable. If you could nab swiftness that would be pretty helpful.  Also you can go artificer and enslave some of the monsters as their HD isn't that high, but I didn't find that particularly useful. Maybe if you could nab a lich or something.  If you're going to go wandering Warper may be a good idea if you can nab passage and use that to get back to the middle. Plus you can use it to nab the sInv ring easier.  EDIT:  After thinking + trying it I think Ghoul Warper is the way to win. You get a 2nd Blink Scroll and you can use apportation to get a sInv ring. If you have the opportunity you can nab passage which can potential help out.  This worked very well for me up until I blinked to the Meatlord because he was near the exit. I was really hoping I could survive blinking to him, kill him, grab the orb, then blink to the exit. Second time I killed the meatlord adjacent to the exit portal then moved to his corpse instead of picking up the orb :(.  I tried Gargoyle and Spriggan Warpers a bit, the problem with both races later on is you can die in a single turn even without taking any melee shots. The -% hp cuts too deep. It's a shame too Gargoyles would be really nice. The poison and electric damage is pretty big towards the end and Grs would help with both."
dcss,33nk77,MolotovDodgeball,4,Fri Apr 24 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"You're totally right.. I was able to win with a ghoul. I used warper, but didn't even burn my blink scrolls. I fought my way to the top, apported the Sinv ring, fought my way back to the center, used haste when they slowed me, and then fought til the meatlord showed up. Knowing the orb appears at your feet and not on his corpse helped. In terms of winning and getting high score, I think you'd have to find a way to hide as Formicid (or as a -very- lucky Artificer or Earth Elementalist) and then fight your way back to the center... once all 5000 guys have spawned..."

Depends on how you want to go from there, really. Picking a god earlier would have likely been better, but since you're there already, I suggest picking whatever strikes your fancy."
dcss,33lzc8,Eptagon,3,Thu Apr 23 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the point in Qazlal for a hybrid fighter/pure caster. You really want to be able to focus on Invocations for Qazlal and with all the generated noise and attention you attract I'd be really concerned about having a build that relies on my MP pool to kill enemies efficiently.  Plus if you can blast apart anything dangerous with the god powers pretty reliably, why invest in magic skills to do the same?  I suppose you could go for more of a statue form focus, but it still seems disconnected. If you're already investing that much into earth magic, why not just nuke with that and worship a god that covers your weaknesses rather than something you're already good at?"
dcss,33lzc8,Slogo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well, if you go Qazlal you're not guarranteed to find Shatter or any of the other high level earth spells, in a typical 3 runer. Therefore, your investment in that school may not be that high and you'll end up as more of a hybrid. Your MP will then be spent to buff yourself and soften the toughest foes, or to call divine powers. Also, passive damage all around isn't bad if you do end up shattering stuff. I have fond memories of going to Vaults:5 and blasting everything in sight with clouds, shatters and possibly a disaster area.  Anyway, Oka, Chei and Qazlal are my personal preferences, due to my playstyle, but I stand by my statement that he should pick what suits him best. The only really bad choices would be Chei (despite my fondness of that deity), Trog and Xom (and somebody likes that guy too). Possibly Gozag too, since it's not that good at what it does.  Really, if you have enough experience it's likely that the first god found, unless terrible for your build, is the right choice. And by that point he should have other tools to figure out what's best for him, as /u/WinterShine mentions."
dcss,33lzc8,Eptagon,2,Thu Apr 23 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"Whichever ones you skipped on D:2-4. :P  In all seriousness, now that you've waited out the choice, it depends on what your character looks like up to this point, and what you're interested in doing with it. Most gods are viable for most builds and it's hard to give specific advice without a dump. So the advice will tend to be the generic always good choice like Makhleb (who, admittedly, is in fact nearly always a good choice).  Found a good weapon and are training to hit things? Oka will make you good at this and save you some xp (that you can put in spell schools or w/e). Found a book with better non-fire conjurations? Try Dith and its shadow mimic. Trained heavily in magic as your killdudes skill but lacking books? Veh or Sif. Found a cool rod? Take Nem to double down on training Evo. Found a million fruit? Oklobs! (Also rain is nice with flight.) Found a staff of earth? Binding that and some jewelry will make you quite powerful under Ash. Etc, etc."

This means, do Depths and maybe optional branches like Crypt if you think you might benefit from the loot.  Your biggest priorities right now are to improve your EV and remove the Large Shield penalties, focus on that for a while. (Demon whip is at mindelay already right?)  Keep an eye out for Shadow DA or Gold DA (relevant dragons often spawn in Depths) to use those scrolls of Enchantment on.  I would probably forget about magic for now, it is easier to screw up."

If you're using automatic training, I'd switch to manual. Also, you should be training at most 3 skills at a time.  Why are you lugging around all those weapons? Is it a Xom thing?  Recharge the wand of heal wounds. Don't wait until you need it.  I'd wear something more effective, if you can find it. PDA, ShDA, GDA, StDA, CPA would all be good. As has been mentioned, Shadow and Gold should be fairly easy to come by. Enchant cloak to +2, meanwhile.  Crypt can be dangerous, but as a Gr you dodge a lot of the bad stuff that happens in there. Give it a try and if it's too scary skip it. Vaults 1-4 shouldn't be too hard. For 5, you can probably run diagonally and end up in a 2 tiles wide border, which will make duking it out a lot easier.

Warper is great for this, because the Book of Spatial Translocations is a wonderful utility book that will help you stay alive, but does not dictate how you kill dudes.  Most of the warrior-mages are fine starts for a Human. Enchanter was recently buffed; you might check that out - no need to be a stabber; Enchanter had a powerful starting book before the buff, so it should be even better now. (They took out Sure Blade and Enslave and added Tukima's Dance, which now has a huge hexpower boost, meaning that with minimal training you get a dancing weapon ally in most fights.) Do be aware that Skald's starting book is kinda subpar, so consider that a mild challenge class.  Ice Elementalist, Air Elementalist, Earth Elementalist, Necromancer and Wizard are also good starts.  I would not recommend a non-book start for a Human."

If you're having trouble winning one, you may want to consider a background that gives you an edge in the early game when their advantage of adaptation hasn't really given them a leg up yet.  If you want to rule out Be (which I certainly understand), the other zealot, AK, might interest you. Careful use of Lugonu's powers can help a fair bit in surviving the early to mid game, just banish anything really dangerous. You won't gain piety quickly that way, but Banish is all you really need for the first bit.  Summoners and Necromancers both start out with books that are strong early, and both can transition into melee if that's what you prefer to do. (Necro basically is a melee class.)  For more conjuration focused builds, VM gets a pretty easy start (a lot of the early game is destroyed by poison).  Also, if surviving the early game is an issue, make sure you're picking a god early. Really you want to pick the first altar you see unless it makes no sense. Most gods work with most builds, even if they seem to be focused on one thing. Dithmenos, for example, is not exclusively for stealthy characters (it's amazing with a conjurer for instance, thanks to shadow mimic).

Really the biggest thing that will let you utilize your flexibility is not your background, but your god choice. Taking a god that you find early and building your character around that can do you wonders, as can choosing gods that specifically allow for flexibility, such as Ash, Oka, Fedhas, Makhleb, Lugonu, Zin, or Kiku."

dcss,33hhx2,quik2903,2,Wed Apr 22 15:47:24 2015 UTC,"Armour: Look for medium armour, like what you are wearing now. Ideally, swamp dragon armour and quicksilver dragon armour are both good options. Wear your boots.  Armour skill: Avoid armour skill for quite a while, since you have -3 apt for it, it's quite early still, and you aren't wearing very heavy armour.  Weapons: Look for 2handers like glaives with a good enchant like freezing/flaming/elec/vamp. If a good demon trident shows up, you can switch to that and pick up a buckler. Ideally you'll want a bardiche at endgame, which Oka might gift or you might find. +4 apt for polearms makes training to 26 quite reasonable. An immediate goal would be to switch to a glaive (and 20 pole skill) or at least a halberd.  Spells: Avoid learning any of the cloud spells. Freezing/poison cloud is interesting but given your armour, lack of spell skill, and god, focusing on melee is the stronger option. If you find blink or repel missiles, learn them."
dcss,33hhx2,zxc223,4,Wed Apr 22 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. With regards to armour, before you have any dodging or armour its often good to wear the heaviest thing you can find, yes even on a Mf. Once you start training your dodging up, you should aim for something more medium-weight.  Its definitely a good idea to train armour skill, even at -3 apt, however it should definitely be lower priority than dodging, and it depends on the armour you're wearing. The primary reason to train armour skill is to gain AC, and spellcasting, EV and accuracy are only mildly affected by this. The AC you gain is dependant on your armour's base AC, scales linearly and doubles it at 22 armour skill (so you need 9.6 armour skill to get 4 AC when wearing plate (base AC = 10) and you need 17.2 to get the same from ring mail (base AC = 5)). When I play Mf, I train dodging first for a bit, and then also put armour on and expect it to always be a few levels less than the dodging skill."
dcss,33hhx2,triorph,2,Wed Apr 22 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Armour skill also counts the base AC from all equipment (armour, gloves, boots, helmet, and cloak), so it's actually better than what you describe."
dcss,33hhx2,DicemanCometh,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? In that case I'm pretty sad that draconians can't train armour at all, even for the tiny benefit."
dcss,33hhx2,I_Probably_Think,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. If you look at your AC in game, and how much armour skill it takes to raise it by one point you can see the effect. Or take off some armour and see that your AC will drop by more than base AC plus enchantment."

dcss,33hhx2,I_Probably_Think,2,Fri Apr 24 03:27:54 2015 UTC,Quick update: I went on to win. Thanks for all the help!
dcss,33hhx2,Slogo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much wear whatever armor short of maybe crystal dragon and gold dragon (until you get a little more strength).  The only thing you need to watch for is your EV since you've invested more into dodging at this point. You could lose on total defense if the armor you're looking to wear is too much encumbrance and it drops your EV too sharply. Probably try to stay above 20 EV unless you're getting like 35+ AC in the new armor.  If you want to branch into offensive magic you'd probably want to focus on a mid-range encumbrance armor like Pearl/Fire/Ice Dragon Armor. If you just want some level 1-3 charm spells to cast you can go all the way to plate/crystal/golden dragon armor; though your terrible apt in armor as Mf will make getting the most out of those armors a bit slow.  In terms of armor skill I usually just do it by feel. If your total AC doesn't seem that high and/or your EV gets cut especially deep then train more armor until things balance out a bit more. Same with spell casting success; if wearing the heavier armor is tanking your casting success you can consider training armor a bit more (you can also train the spell casting schools which is probably more effective until high spell casting levels, but training armor would also give you AC & EV)."
dcss,33hhx2,triorph,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you guys for all your replies. Very interesting stuff!  I've played a little more. Now this is how the char looks like: Char dump   Weapons: Look for 2handers like glaives with a good enchant like freezing/flaming/elec/vamp. If a good demon trident shows up, you can switch to that and pick up a buckler.   At the moment I have a +1 demon trident of flame and a +1 bardiche of flaming. I've got no buckler, but I have a shield and a very large shield. The skill in polearms is at 19.5.   before you have any dodging or armour its often good to wear the heaviest thing you can find   Good to know, thanks!   Its definitely a good idea to train armour skill, even at -3 apt, however it should definitely be lower priority than dodging, and it depends on the armour you're wearing.   Now I can choose between a quicksilver dragon armor (AC 19 EV 25), a +2 gold dragon armor (25, 10) and a +10 plate armor {rCorr Int+3} (30, 16).   Probably try to stay above 20 EV unless you're getting like 35+ AC in the new armor.  (...)  If your total AC doesn't seem that high and/or your EV gets cut especially deep then train more armor until things balance out a bit more.   According to this, I'm wearing the quicksilver armor, but I understand that if I train the armor skill I may be able to change to the plate armor. Am I right? Is it worth it?  Thank you again!"
dcss,33hhx2,a-r-c,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"That's a nice plate armour. You could easily choose either the quicksilver dragon armour or the plate armour and win the game with your choice. QDA probably lets your dodging skill shine more, which is easier to train, but your AC+EV is better in the plate armour, and the AC part is usually slightly better than the EV part too."
dcss,33fmpm,quik2903,2,Wed Apr 22 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  My first two spellcaster wins were GrEE's.  I found them much easier than the more traditional DEFE or DEWz because the HP and AC just make them more durable and less subject to being one-shotted.  Or killed in melee if my fat fingers hit the wrong key and a tough monster gets two attacks in a row on me.  Once my spellcasters get Haste, blink, and get their level 6 spells spammable (Iron Shot, Bolt of Fire, etc), and one cloud spell (poisonous or freezing), the confidence level is high - definitely higher than with a melee character at the same level.  But that all ends when I go the abyss.  Running out of MP in the Abyss just sucks - most of my spell casters run around the Abyss like their hair is on fire.  Whereas I've had some melee characters that could pretty much tab their way through Abyss.  My current HEWz has 5 runes (including Slime and Tomb), but basically gave up on getting that Abyss rune.  He's now working on Pan.  Question:  how did you do Vault:5?  Stairdancing is usually a terrible choice, but with EE's I've found it really fun to stairdance with Shatter.  Haste, go down stairs, shatter a few times, go back up.  Only trick is if a Warden locks the stairs in which case you need to target him for destruction."
dcss,33fmpm,ryeoldfashioned,2,Wed Apr 22 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"Going backwards!  I didn't see it happen, but I'm guessing you don't even need to stair-dance if you have enough Shatter power, and Gr are very tanky for free.  An amusing thing to do if you're going to be noisy anyways is to read ?immolation as soon as you descend!  I suggest giving the Abyss rune a try if you can get some nice sources of regeneration; the trick is to strike an appropriate balance between killing things that could be too dangerous and staying away from things that you can avoid.  Stealth helps!  Who are you worshipping?  I have trouble with the squishier casters too; I think most of my wins are draconian casters XD. Though one tourney I somehow managed to ascend as a flying octopode of dooooom  Edit: oh goodness sorry about the multiposting, was too impatient at my Internet connection.  Also, ""doiooom"" is now spelled correctly."
dcss,33fmpm,I_Probably_Think,2,Wed Apr 22 08:33:30 2015 UTC,"You're right, I'll give Abyss another try when (if) I make it out of Pan.  Since my first attempt, I've changed my build so I now have 62MP (compared to 50), so hopefully that helps a bit with the constantly low on MP problem.  Also I do have Regen - last time in Abyss for some reason I never thought to cast it.  It would have helped a lot.  Lastly I worship Vehumet unfortunately.  When playing Wz's I always choose Veh because I feel a huge sense of urgency to get a better offensive spell than magic dart/meph cloud online as quickly as possible.  Trying to take down a hydra with magic dart and some imps isn't fun.  Stone Arrow or even Throw Flame can be a lifesaver for a Wz while you're waiting for the really good spells.  But right now - yeah I really miss Sif's Channel ability.  The combo of Channel + Regen would make life in Abyss so much easier for a spellcaster.  My stealth is a little better than my first time through also.  Have stealth skill to 12 I think, and one or two of my items are stealth+.  Okay, I've talked myself into it, Abyss is my next stop after I leave Pan."
dcss,33fmpm,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"62 is a ton of MP XD  Power pretty much got a buff, as far as I can tell!  Veh is totally fine for Abyss too!  :D  You have to be a bit more careful than if you were worshiping Sif though, yeah.  Good luck, hope it goes alright :)"
dcss,33fmpm,I_Probably_Think,2,Wed Apr 22 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"Once my spellcasters get Haste, blink, and get their level 6 spells spammable (Iron Shot, Bolt of Fire, etc), and one cloud spell (poisonous or freezing), the confidence level is high   Nice! It's good to know what spells are the most useful.   Question: how did you do Vault:5?   At first, I was going to control-teleport out of the middle, but then I noticed that no wardens had generated and decided to stairdance. It was fun :D. There also was a ghost who was able to survive my Shatters and was able to cast silence. He couldn't harm me, but I was a little worried that he might silence me in an inconvenient moment. When most of the level was cleared, he went down after a long melee / LCS fight."

Not only does Orc have more xp for you, it also has tons of gold and shops at the end.

dcss,33f22z,Quazifuji,2,Wed Apr 22 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"Not being amazing is something I agree with, but I don't believe it's that mediocre either. In the early game I reckon it's much better than an elemental staff and that may be the case, altough it's less clear, in the very late game too. In the midgame I'd still want a better melee option. Now, if it was a +10 broad axe of speed, that would be a different story. Even with the previously mentioned Gr, apart from Arga, the only broad axe of speed I've found has just Int+3 and MP+9 (and MR+ and rC-, but those are kind of irrelevant). Might still be worth using over Brilliance, for when I do want to bash stuff in CC, but I'm not sure about it."
dcss,33f22z,Eptagon,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:00:19 2015 UTC,"The new Brilliance (an Eveningstar) is pretty awesome. I'm currently using one also on my Gr and it's smashing apart demons without trouble.  It's not super super flashy, but this ring has seen me through a lot, though the rElec is going to waste since it's on a Gr: ring ""Phapheis"" {rElec rF+ rN+ MR+ Str+2 Stlth-}  I also like it pairs with the same character's ring of Secrets {rPois rF+ rC+} (which again is also a bit silly as a Gr because of poison immunity)  Maybe I'm just not into flashy stuff, but I find rings with stacked resistances like that are incredibly helpful. Between those two rings you'd be 2 levels of rN away from having a really filled out set of resistances (or as a gargoyle, 1 level away)."
dcss,33f22z,Slogo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"My ""Brilliance"" is a +1 Eveningstar {Holy, rN+, AC+5, Int+5}, I guess that's the one you're talking about? In Mega-Zigs a broad axe is better, though, for when you really need to kill something with rElec, and can't blast it down with spells, since the splash damage heals you through Makhleb. And speed is more all purpose than holy. The limited range sInv isn't too bad, though, and Int+5 is good enough. Not sure if it does anything else that's special."
dcss,33f22z,Eptagon,2,Thu Apr 23 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"Well yeah but those aren't really great comparisons since they're uh not directly comparable. Sure axes are better in mega-zigs, but that doesn't mean much to someone who has been going mace & flail all game. Not to mention someone that doesn't worship Makhleb.  It may not even outmatch a standard holy branded great mace or eveningstar, but it definitely outmatches my +9 crushing great mace PER HIT (against holy vulnerable targets ofc), never mind the much shorter melee delay.  My point is that it's a pretty good mace to pick-up and seems more than capable of clearing the end-game runes that are demon centric."
dcss,33f22z,Slogo,2,Thu Apr 23 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"Of course, it's a very good weapon for Pan/Crypt/Tomb/Hells. But I mentioned it in the context of Mega-Zigs, so I assumed that was what we were talking about. And once all your skills are maxed out the concerns you expressed in regards to comparability do not apply. What you trained first is irrelevant and you basically have to worship Makhleb.  rN+, AC+5, Int+5 and short ranged sInv are all pretty useful, though the mere +1 isn't great. It still kills at a good enough rate that the superior damage output of a broad axe of speed isn't enough to make me want to switch and lose the bonuses. To be fair, the lower levels (the tough ones, at least) basically force me to have Wucad Mu equipped at all times, though, so the whole thing is kind of moot."

The other obvious stabber choice would be Dithmengos, but in that case you'd want to drop by Elf:2 for the hall of blades and a chance at quick blades. With Oka, you're guaranteed to eventually get a flat damage branded quickblade.  One other option you might explore is Trog stabbing. Same as with Oka you'll be getting weapon gifts, which means plenty of needles and quickblades of stabby death eventually, and berserk and brothers in arms are both powerful options for when your stealth fails you.  Trogs lack of spells will actually help you focus on your core skills better, and having guaranteed rods from acquirement scrolls provides another backup option besides Trog's more obvious abilities. A rod of shadows or even better of the swarm allow for plentiful distraction stabs."

dcss,33by0x,triorph,3,Tue Apr 21 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"The great thing about stealth is that its awesome even if you don't stab dudes, because you have awesome crowd control which lets you get out of danger. ShDA + thin skeletal makes stealth viable, and doing some funky stuff you can become a stabber, but you can also become a stealthy fighter, which is pretty cool too."
dcss,33by0x,CelerityDesu,4,Tue Apr 21 09:06:02 2015 UTC,"Needle stabbing is a very strong strategy all game. Oka will flood you with needles if you choose him, though this isn't strictly necessary.  I think if you wanted to go with such a build, the ShDA could be pretty decent, but keep in mind that the best way to proc stabs is via spells, and ShDA will make it very difficult to cast those. Having ridiculously high stealth is nice, but it won't help you much after you've been noticed, so you need a plan to actually disable things that see you. A ring/cloak of invis would probably be the best option.  ShDA would also probably be decent for your original strategy, since it's pretty nice heavy armor and stealth is overall useful for any ranged fighter as a way to split packs. Don't bother stabbing with anything other than blades, though, it isn't worth it."

Deep elves already get a hp malus and by not training fighting you're very vulnerable. With this hp, a stone giant could probably kill you with 3 rocks, if they all hit. Anyway, what I would do:   Immediately stop raising any magic skills. Get a buckler [branded if possible] and raise shields to 5. Learn deflect missiles and AlWAYS, ALWAYS have it on. With your int and skills it will probably have less than 5% fail rate. This will go a LONG way in keeping you safe from almost all ranged attacks. GET FIGHTING, OMG. At least 10, preferably more than 15. It will give you some much needed hp. Get 12 staves and around 10 evocations. With these and your skill in cold, your staff of cold will deal very respectable damage in melee [which ignores AC!] to enemies without cold resistance. Very handy for recovering mp when you're out [by killing dudes in melee], conserving mp from killing non threatening enemies and so on. Forget shit spells. These include mephitic cloud [noisy and pretty much useless after d10], throw frost, condensation shield, conjure flame and fulminant prism [also noisy!]. Get some good spells. Since you're having trouble with crowd control, freezing cloud is really a must. Also blink and regeneration [100% mandatory]. And I would get bolt of cold/fire [or both even]. Bolt of cold should be your go-to spell, especially for gathering enemies in a hallway and blasting. Poison arrow for strong non-poison immune stuff, like stone/fire/cold giants. Dispel undead is an excellent solution for liches. After you do all that, I'd go for 20 in fighting/dodging. Then you can go for whatever you want. I'd personally grab LCS, for dangerous stuff that resists everything and uniques. OoD + LCS is a very strong combo for killing orbs of fire. Also consider getting spellforged servitor, I've heard good things about it, though I've not tried it personally."

I actually have a book with deflect missiles in my stash but didn't have the requisite skill to cast it worth a damn before.

Heavily armored minotaurs are awful at magic. Magic wasn't even remotely worth my time until the postgame runes. At eight runes, I've only just now finished skilling up my important schools (Tloc, Charms, Air, Summoning) up to skill 9 or 10 - high enough to cast 3rd level spells reliably. Fighting, weapon skill, defenses, evo, and invo, were all much more useful for pretty much the whole first three runes. I don't recall exactly when I started training my casting skills, but I think it was sometime around V:5 or Abyss.  Next time, focus on your fighting and your god and get your magic from consumables for awhile longer. At least until you have spells worth learning: the really good low-level utility stuff like Summon Butterflies, Apportation, Blink, Swiftness, and Repel Missiles. You are an armor/weapon guy. I can't imagine a situation where anything in transmutations would have been terribly useful to you. Maybe as a supplement to Earth for stoneskin and passwall. That's about it, though."

dcss,335zme,Ijyb,6,Sun Apr 19 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"ok, first basics:  ID all your potions and scrolls. Find a buckler, wear it, curse it, train shields to 3. Consider cursing the dagger. Train short blades to 10 (or not if you go for cursing). If you have enchant weapon+2 sink into dagger. Train fighting to 5- all these are trainings are really cheap and will benefit you greatly.   Next: dont go further into dungeon, go and do lair for now. After all that stuff I just listed your next goal, single topmost priority, is getting Invisibilty online (its still in the malediction book, right?) . Invisibility will get you all the way trough lair, orc, dungeon and to your first rune. Thats how good and OP it is. Its so OP they took it out of the starter book in later version!  That means hexes around 13-14, pretty cheap if you get fully cursed in magic with Ash.   After you have invisibilty, only train defenses for like, all of lair+orc, then more defenses, Spellcasting, stealth etc whatever you like.   Which branches are good for stabbers? Shoals+swamp+spider are awesome, nearly no see-invisible monsters.  snake is worthless, so if you get snake go into the other one.   Good luck, and good hunting."

That way you're not relying on luck to get that spell school rolling and the spells will carry you far. If you have your heart set out on Assassin though then you shouldn't really be banking your build on something you may not even find.   As for crypt, it's not essential, so consider ignoring it. On a 3-rune game I only go into it if I really want rMut before Zot and I've yet to find it anywhere else. If you somehow are able to find something strong enough against the enemies in there then go ahead and do it, just weigh the risk, reward, and your wants and needs a little more.   Don't disregard necro so quickly, you could easily opt into necromancy as an alternative for freezing cloud. It meshes with a stealthy playstyle better anyways. It would also be far more efficient XP wise (committing to necro, vs committing to 3 spell schools for a level 6 spell). Not that there aren't other benefits to using those spell schools, but it's just a rather large investment. You also wouldn't be just using Dispel Undead, many consider animate dead and regeneration to be some of the best low level spells.   With that said I understand if you want to keep using freezing cloud because it is a great and fun spell. Dazzling Spray and Bolt of Cold would both be a bit better than freezing cloud and mesh with the skills you would already have, although I suspect you may have already tried those. A pure conjurations spell might also work better, but -3 apt might not make it worthwhile.   Depending on your weapon and defenses you could straight up melee them too, although you probably won't be strong enough in melee if you are diving into so many schools of magic, or if you're leveling intelligence. If you do happen to do a character geared towards melee then a decently enchanted quickblade or cutlass will be able to handle them, assuming you have atleast moderate AC/EV/SH. Be on the lookout for electrocution specifically as I don't think anything in crypt might resist it other than liches."

dcss,331ygm,Xelif,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"So, you're making a common mistake here.  Assassin, as it currently stands, is not a stabber background.  Instead of thinking of backgrounds as long-range templates for character building, instead consider them for what they are - simply a set of tools your character starts with.   Assassin's big tool is the starting blowgun and curare needles. This is immensely helpful in the early Dungeon, since you can kite pretty much everything to death. (Unfortunately, curare was recently nerfed - it had asphyxiation removed, meaning it won't make orc wizards/orc priests/Sigmund/Dowan etc. shut up any more.)  While you can take any start along any path you want, Assassin lends itself most naturally to melee, first in light armor to take advantage of your starting Stealth skill, later in medium or heavy armor depending on your species, stat gains, and equipment finds - you might end up smashing everything with an artifact great mace in plate armor, or you might end up with morningstar, buckler, troll leather, and Ozocubu's Armour and other such support spells.   Should mention, going Dithmenos,   Of course you're free to plan to go with a certain god, but it's usually best to take the first altar you stumble upon that isn't totally useless. A D:2 Fedhas altar means I'm going Fedhas, for example, on pretty much every character ever.  Contrary to what you might think, Dithmenos isn't a ""stabber god"". She's a generalist god that helps everyone. Umbra grants you some extra stealth and effectively extra evasion - helpful to everyone. Shadow Step helps you get in melee range with troublesome ranged stuff - helpful to everyone who uses melee. Bleed Smoke gives you fog (which reduces LOS) on taking damage - powerful, and helpful to everyone. Shadow Mimic gives you extra damage - helpful to everyone (and arguably least helpful to stabbers). Shadow Form is a powerful escape option with tactical uses (ninja the golden rune, for example) - helpful to everyone. Dithmenos is in the same category as Lugonu, Zin, Elyvilon, and Fedhas - gods with diverse, powerful abilities that help you kill dudes and stay alive, and that are flexible and don't funnel you toward any particular build."
dcss,331ygm,Xelif,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to realize how not-melee Enchanters were as opposed to Assassins. Learned that one the hard way after trying to tab through Jackals on D:1. Multiple times.  I always thought of Dithmenos as being just for stabbing, but it's interesting to see it from another perspective. I do have a habit of being very closed-minded about what equipment I pick up (in this case, ignoring anything that isn't a short blade or heavier than leather. Maybe a bit more founded on a stabber/caster going up to 6th level spells).  I think the Shadow Mimic is helpful to stabbers, though, because the mimic attacks have a chance to distract the enemy and make them stabbable (stabable?)  I usually don't bother with Shadow Form, because if I disregard it, I only have to train Invocations up to 2.0 to get 1% shadowstep, whereas its a much higher investment to get shadow form reliable - and I usually have other escape options that don't result in skill drain. What level of Invocations would you train up to as a Dithmenos follower? (Vampires having a -1 aptitude)"

And all your wands, any misc items, elemental evocers benefit from it. At 15 evo, your attack wands are fearsome, and your MR-resistable wands have really good chance to affect post-lair enemies."

There are several rods which will completely change your style of play if you can manage to find/acquire them. (which you will, because Trog acquirements)  Rod of clouds is highly useful at higher spell power (although pretty shitty at lower) and you should have medium-high evo by the time you acquire one.  Rod of Ignition is a fucking pack destroyer for anything that doesn't resist fire. MULTIPLE fireball explosions in a line is just sick.  Lightning rods are pretty tough when used as a beam, and are useful in a cone for clearing weaker enemies.  Rods of the swarm, or even better, of the shadows, are useful in any branch, at any time, always. Swarm is useful for meatshields and distraction, even when the enemy resists poison such as in the tombs. Shadows is useful everywhere always. It's just like the spell Shadow Creatures in that what it summons is appropriate to the branch you're in, and is usually a pack of multiple creatures."

Even then, I'd need something like a ring with +12 Int and upside before I can reliably cast a Lv.9 spell. Shatter is at 6% right now, after all.  Also, I'm trying not to miss any unrand I find, which borders obsessive compulsive behaviour, so I may want to go at it until I have most unrands and can keep my inventory mostly clear."
dcss,32yokl,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Fri Apr 17 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. GrBr is a BAD combination for clearing megazigs due to low int AND low HP. I'd say ditch it and come back with a demonspawn (nightstalker, robust)."

I got up to four with a GrFi, and I was pretty comfortable most of the time, but you really have to think ""can I handle what happened just now x2?"" after every single floor - the low HP total is really dangerous in many situations. So I'd say go for it, but very, very carefully - you'll probably get bored pretty soon anyway, as zigs don't really get more interesting (or at least ""interesting"" is at least not what I'd call a sudden changed from ""TabTabTabTab"" to ""I'mgonnadieI'mgonnadieI'mgonnadie"" in a single turn).

dcss,32xu1n,dont_tread_on_bees,3,Fri Apr 17 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's ""permawall"". Look under display_char in the options guide for all the possible names.  You should also be able to use the ""feature"" line for this without having to know the technical name for the feature. This allows you to be a little more precise about what you change. If you look at what the feature is called in the game (what it describes the wall as when you examine it in 'x' view), you can use this code to change how it appears in console:  feature += <regex> { <symbol>, <magicmap symbol>, <view colour>,                     <levelmap_magic_colour>, <levelmap_seen_colour>,                     <emphasised_colour>, <levelmap_emphasised_colour> } ;   For example, if you wanted to change the glyph for metal walls to #, you could do this:  feature += metal wall { # }   You could also change it to a red # by doing  feature += metal wall { # , , red }   I'll let you poke through the options guide to see what all those other options do, it's all under ""feature"" near the bottom. As you can see by my first example, if you only want to change the glyph you can just leave the rest blank.  A nice thing about using 'feature' is you can distinguish shop portals from other portals and give them different glyphs, if you care to, since it uses the in-game 'x' description rather than simply referring to them all as 'arch'."

His invocations are the entire reason to pick him and help to balance out his downsides.  Usually before I go for my first rune I try to have invo at 15, where Upheaval can reliably 2-shot things and Elemental Force should start giving you 5 elementals per cast. It can be a good idea to raise your skill all the way up to 20-25 for V:5, where you can basically clear the entire floor with Disaster Area."
dcss,32rl5q,CelerityDesu,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:42:14 2015 UTC,Along the same lines I don't see the point in going axes + Qazlal. You already have all the AoE clear you could possibly want for anything that's remotely dangerous in a pack.  Eveningstars are faster for the same damage so it's just a matter of finding a good one you can enchant up.  Plus as a worshipper of Qazlal rF++ (and rC++) is practically the same as rF+++ and rF+ is passable since you'll get the extra resistance when hit by fire damage. Between a shield and all the other slots it shouldn't be hard to get rF++ from other gear. Meanwhile rN+ is pretty useful and Qazlal won't help you there.

dcss,32rl5q,Fambida,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"Rune 3 is a tossup between slime pits, abyss, and vaults. Typically vaults will be the easiest of those 3, and abyss 2nd easiest. However, if you find an early jiyva altar at the entrance to slime (or before then), then slime pits becomes the easiest rune 3 possible. (This of course assumes your current god doesn't have a nasty wrath. I've never abandoned Qaz before, so I'm not sure how bad his wrath is.)  See here http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Rune#Easy  One thing to note is that if you haven't found rMut yet, Vaults is by far the safest option, since Abyss will provide lots of temporary, and some permanent bad mutations, and slime pits will straight up provide more permanent bad mutations than Zot itself."
dcss,32rl5q,WinterShine,3,Thu Apr 16 04:50:43 2015 UTC,"Qazlal wrath involves being temporarily mutated with rF--, rC-- and rElec-, having the floor turned to lava around you, and having elementals (which scale based on your XL, and so can be much more powerful than the typical elementals you encounter) attack you (possibly while your resistances are still nerfed).  Abandoning in a three-rune game is rarely a good idea, save TSO/Ely to non-evil, or Zin to non-evil non-chaotic."
dcss,32rl5q,Xelif,2,Thu Apr 16 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"Which one is easiest depends on your character.  Beefy melee tank that's good at killing lots of stuff fast? Vaults is probably the easiest.  Stealthy character with escape options? Abyss is probably the easiest. (Abyss is a special case because there's a degenerate low-risk high-boredom way to explore it - wear a ring of teleportation, and evoke it after every teleport. Eventually you'll find the rune. Note that when you have the Tele status, evoking teleport or reading a scroll of teleport clears it - a litte-known but useful trick! If you pick up nasty transient mutations from a wretched star you can hit stuff until you get rid of them, but if you're going Abyss for your 3rd rune you want to stay out of combat as much as possible.)  Can you get rCorr, rMut, and rC+? Slime Pits is probably the easiest.  Are you a Kiku worshipper with high-power Dispel Undead? Tomb is a sneaky option. It's probably a better third rune for experienced players, since the layout is relatively fixed."

If you're going to go in that direction...you could just enchant up that holy eveningstar, pack a good shield, and get the demonic rune from Pandemonium.  Almost everything in Pandemonium is vulnerable to holy, and there is a rune there randomly on one of the non-main Pan lord floors.  Each floor that doesn't have one of the big guys (Mnoleg, Lom Lobon, etc.) has a randomly generated Pan lord with a name like Floenemrt, and a chance of the demonic rune at wherever he came from.

dcss,32ovv9,Juan_Duo,5,Wed Apr 15 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"When Xom decides to mutate you, the effect ignores rMut (from amulet or mutations). As such this isn't really doing a lot for you. You will, however, get the benefit of rMut if Xom uses a potion effect on you and potion of mutation is picked.  In general my understanding is that Xom mutations tend to balance toward good in general. The learndb suggests that this is because Xom worshippers end up with a good mutation set ""or are dead"" lol. Having not played Xom a great deal, I'm only relaying info I've seen elsewhere here, but it would explain why you're seeing a balance of good mutations with rMut: you'd be seeing the same balance of good mutations without it (modulo some minor difference from avoiding the occasional potion of mutation, which likely comes up pretty rarely anyway)."
dcss,32ovv9,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but I have played Xom a great deal and my objective experience says otherwise.    learndb: ""When Xom is in a bad mood he gives you bad mutations, and when he's in a good mood he gives you good mutations.""  I have fully resisted Xoms ""you need some changes mortal"" (or whatever he says) due to rmut.  Not trying to be a jerk my experience just runs contrary to what you have said.  That said I guess I could be wrong."
dcss,32ovv9,Juan_Duo,3,Wed Apr 15 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"Short version: rMut does not work against Xom's mutation effect at all. However, the mutation resistance probability of n/15 where n is the number of non-innate mutations you already have works against Xom's bad mutations, but not against its good ones, which is why you resist bad mutations while wearing rMut (because you'd have the same odds of resisting them without it) and why good mutations are working without rMut (they don't even check the n/15).    Long version:  So I had a look in the code. When Xom does a mutation, it calls the mutate function as follows:  mutate(good ? RANDOM_GOOD_MUTATION : RANDOM_XOM_MUTATION,            good ? ""Xom's grace"" : ""Xom's mischief"",            failMsg, false, true, false, MUTCLASS_NORMAL)   In order, the parameters say to make it a good/Xom mutation (depending on mood), the message to say in the log for why the mutation happened, a fail message to show in the log if needed, the first 'false' means it's not forced (forced is used for stuff like demonspawn/draconian mutations which are species based and must occur), the true means it's a god mutation, and the other false means it's not considered a beneficial mutation. The last bit is a sort of mutation class which is used in the mutate function.  Because it's a non-forced god mutation, the mutate function does not check rMut, but it does check Zin resistance. You can see that here starting from the line ""if (!force_mutation)"". So what I said is true.  Later in the same code, starting from the line ""if (mutclass == MUTCLASS_NORMAL"", we see that if the mutation is a RANDOM_XOM_MUTATION (one of the bad ones) then it actually checks the mutation resistance obtained from being already heavily mutated. Interestingly, if Xom is granting a good mutation, it uses RANDOM_GOOD_MUTATION as its which_mutation, and hence ignores that n/15 resistance probability.  What this means is that in a case like OP's, if you add up all their levels of (non-species) mutations, you'll see they have exactly 15. If Xom attempted to do a bad mutation, it would be resisted with probability 15/15. (When this is not caused by a god gift or forced mutation, there is then a 1/3 chance that this deletes a mutation, but Xom gives god gifts and hence doesn't provide this chance.) If I'm reading the code right, Xom cannot further negatively mutate a character with 15+ levels of good mutations.  On the other hand, if Xom does a good mutation, the code appears to skip the n/15 probability of resisting a mutation. Hence good mutations from Xom will always apparently apply. (Only RANDOM_MUTATION and RANDOM_XOM_MUTATION check the n/15 odds.)   This would explain why Xom tends to give mutation sets which are overall positive (it can add good mutations to people with 15+ levels, but not bad/random ones), and would also explain why you were seeing bad mutations resisted (you likely already had several levels of mutations of some variety, giving this innate resistance)."
dcss,32ovv9,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Woah, if I understand you correctly, this actually makes Xom unbalanced. That sort of momentum is absolutely ridiculous."
dcss,32ovv9,Xemxah,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, unbalanced might be a bit of a stretch. You're still with a god who will randomly turn the enemy you're fighting into something terrible, or decide to confuse you in the middle of dealing with an OOF or something. This is more like... compensation lol. It's true in general that Xom worshippers do tend to end up with somewhat positive mutation sets though.  I'm sure if the devs thought that Xom was too easy to win with, they'd have changed something by now. I doubt people go crawling through the code a lot to find out details, but it's not as though they'd be unaware of the fact that people often end up with good mutation sets.  Though I do remember a thread on the Tavern about intentionally scumming Xom to get a good mutation set and then abandoning. :P In terms of winrate it's likely a terrible idea, but it is kind of amusing."

dcss,32gh73,Konebred,2,Mon Apr 13 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not so familiar with late game Su or mummies in general, but I can offer this more general advice (which perhaps will help in future Zot attempts as well).   If you're going to grab the orb and win (as opposed to preparing to do extended after), there's not a whole lot of XP left in the game for you. As such, you don't want to try to ""get something online"" which you don't already have access to. (Ex: Don't try to get enough charms for Haste if you're not already very close to having it.) Instead, you want to look at where gradual gains in XP will have the most benefits.  Examples:   Defence skills: how much AC/EV would you get from training Armour/Dodging, based on your stats, gear and existing levels? (This is especially good to train if you are low in one of these skills, and stand to benefit greatly from gaining several levels.) Offence skills: Fighting is great, because it ups your melee DPS and HP. Probably better than training a weapon past mindelay. A blaster mage could put some points in their spell school(s) to do more damage if you're feeling underpowered. Spell-related stuff:   If you have a spell that would benefit from having more spellpower, you could train for that. (This is mostly damaging magic, but could affect some defences like Ozo's if you don't have much training in them yet.) If you have an important spell that is castable, but not at a great success rate, improving the success rate could help. Getting a vital spell from 8% to 4% not only means less chance to fail the first try, but much less chance of stringing together successive failures, which can be dangerous in a fight.  Evocations is great if you have useful evokables. Elemental evokers recharge fairly quickly at this stage too. (Be careful about AOE stuff as a summoner though.) Similarly, invo if your god's abilities benefit from it. (Sif technically does, but training for channelling late game doesn't seem worth it.)   At a glance, I'm not sure it's worth trying to train Tloc for Malign Gateway when you already have Hydra, Haunt, and Menagerie. Your total of 7 base AC means you need about 3 levels in Armour per 1 point of AC, which also doesn't seem very worth it. Your Dodging is already pretty high too, though you could train that more, or go for Fighting which is always good. I don't think you stand to benefit a lot from Evo/Invo.   Train summoning if you think you need more power to kill things using it. If you're already powerful enough on offence (keep in mind orbs of fire when deciding that), Fighting would be next I'd guess.  Also, try that ring of protection on. Since you're on 18 AC + 36 EV, I would definitely take a +4 or +5 AC ring over one of those +5 EV rings. I might even consider taking a +3 AC ring over +5 EV. (EV doesn't work against AOE attacks like OOF fireballs and some Ancient Lich attacks. You can dodge bolts of fire though.)"
dcss,32gh73,WinterShine,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"Malign gateway has too high a cost to be very useful (1-3 INT per cast is nuckin futs), However, if there are any spellbooks with it laying around, Summon Forest is pretty damn useful, and uses the same skills.  I'd suggest immediately memorizing Shadow creatures. It is a spell that never gets underpowered, due to summoning creatures native to the branch you're in. Especially in Zot it is very very good. (Ancient Liches fighting FOR me? YES PLEASE!)  My last win was based around summon forest and shadow creatures for most of the late game."
dcss,32gh73,Fambida,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"More Summoning/dodging (fighting third). Less spellcasting!

This happens if you see an enemy wielding it, which identifies it for you as enchanted but not branded.  A glowing weapon could either be a + or - or curse (like ""enchanted"" but not identified by being seen on an enemy), or could be branded.

If it was a really great weapon, it might be worth using for a bit anyways even without training in the weapon category, but a flaming demon whip is only really good, not great (unless you're already using maces and flails).  I would only switch for a truly exceptional weapon (a +12 +Blink rF++ rC++ Elec demon whip, for example, would probably be worth the switch), or a really great weapon if the weapon class cross-trains with your current choice."

One of the key aspects of DCSS that's not immediately obvious - and is pretty counter-intuitive given how most games work - is that starting backgrounds do not dictate your character's play style. Your background only dictates the items and skills you begin with; it has no continuing effect once you enter the dungeon, with the exception of Abyssal Knight and Chaos Knight, who are stuck with gods.  Unarmed combat is not why you start as a Monk, especially now that you can choose ""unarmed"" as your weapon for classes that have a weapon choice, and receive skill accordingly. The Monk's unique attribute is two *s of extra starting piety. However, that's pretty unnecessary for a Troll using unarmed - extra starting piety will help you early on, but you should already roll over everything pretty easily. The extra starting piety is less useful against things you may have trouble with early - orc priests, uniques, etc.  I would suggest a different background for an unarmed troll. Here are some options:   Assassin - for the blowgun and needles. Pop curare needles on annoying early caster threats, such as orc priests. Kite everything you don't overpower with poison. Gladiator - throwing nets are awesome for, like, the entire game. They'll help with early threats who you don't want to allow to act against you - adders, for example. You do lose the helmet, though :/ Warper - the Book of Spatial Translocations is probably the best starting book for a melee fighter. Even with horrible Troll aptitudes, you can get Blink to an acceptable fail rate pretty quickly. Abyssal Knight - Lugonu is an all-around awesome deity. Bend Space is an awesome starting invocation to have; Banish and Corrupt are nice tools for difficult situations."

I would say that the simplest start overall is probably a Minotaur Berserker.

Makhleb also heals on all of your kills, while TSO is only evil/demonic/undead. You already have rN+++ from that (great) ring, and you can already summon powerful allies. Switching to TSO would do you more harm than good unless you were planning on going for more runes afterward, and even then, Makhleb is still good in a 15 rune game.   Overall you look quite healthy but you do have a glaring weakness in your dodging stat. Even in heavy armour you shouldn't undervalue evasion, and you have a good apt for it too. You should also put points in dex for your remaining level ups, but that's not entirely necessary. I think with the apt in invocations that you have it would be worthwhile to put a few more points in that, but that is mostly a personal preference thing on my end(I like my spells and abilities to be consistent and reliable).   I'm not actually that experienced with rods but I can say for certain that the rod of clouds is great, and more importantly, fun. With all the recharging you have available to you it would be worthwhile to fully charge one of those up.   Edit: You don't seem to have any rElec, so the biggest single threat you'll face will probably be an electric golem. Be mindful of your positioning when fighting them if you don't want to get multizapped. You have 2 potions of resistance, you may have to use those for them if you can't find an rElec source."
dcss,3291bv,ParticlePhysics8,3,Sat Apr 11 19:02:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed on this on all counts.    To add: rod of clouds with 18 evo is good against even zot monsters. If you get acid for example. drawback is if you get storm, its very loud and the whole level will rush to you. One funny little thing nobody ever mentions: using ?recharge on a rod will fully recharge it instantly. So wait until its empty, then recharge for immediate effect. (this tactic is a lot better with direct-damage rods than the rod of clouds, but stil.)  Which brings us to the next point:  for Zot:5 you really dont want to use a noisy weapon. Find a great mace, of freezing,  enchant it up, train a bit more M&F and you are good."

Unfortunately I haven't seen any Great Maces of Freezing so far. There's a few of Holy Wrath down in Vault:5 I could go get and enchant to +6, or higher if they have a base enchantment. Should I hold out for one with a freezing brand? I haven't seen any more Great Maces spawn at all outside of the Vault."

dcss,3291bv,ParticlePhysics8,2,Sat Apr 11 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"Good call on the dodging. Luckily(?) a lucky Ettin sent me to the Abyss so I decided to head down to the third level and look for the rune. By the time I found it and the exit I was at 13 dodging. My EV is definitely looking a lot better.  On the rElec front I did find a Storm Dragon hide. I've got a total of 8 Enchant Armour scrolls in my game and a +7 Storm Dragon Armour would give +1 AC, rElec, and a tad more GDR at the cost of the +7STR on my artifact Chainmail. How good is rElec, would that be worth it? Along the same lines I just killed a Gold Dragon and got his skin. so I have the same question for +7 GDA. The heavier armor seems nice but+7STR is a lot, right?  Also, I went back and picked up a Rod of Clouds. That thing was actually pretty stellar at clearing out a pretty crowded vault. I'm a fan now."
dcss,3291bv,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Sat Apr 11 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, 7 str is a lot, but resists are probably more important. Especially as a newer player, it allows you to make a mistake and not get punished super hard for it. As it stands now an ice or an electric attack could unexpectedly destroy your health bar.   The choice isn't easy but I'm leaning slightly towards the GDA over SDA. GDA is generally better because of the rarity of electric golems and will provide you with more comfortable, all-purpose resistances. It also replaces the poison resist you'd lose from taking off your armour. With that said though GDA will simply make you more comfortable against stuff you can already fight comfortably. SDA will take the 1 major threat to you(barring Tiamat) and neutralize it.   So...yeah. I probably didn't help you make a choice but instead just added more for you to think about. Maybe wait for another opinion before choosing."
dcss,3291bv,red_riddler,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"I'd go with SDA, on the following premises: GDA is going to tank your dodging again heavily, and will increase the dread of electric golems, for AC/rcold/rpois. SDA will also tank your dodging, but not nearly as muc. Managing without rCold/rPois is doable as tanky char in Zot, just dont stand too long in poison clouds.  What to do against poison clouds?  A) use rod of clouds preemptively and if its a harmless one step into it (for you mostly blast of fire/mist)  B) read scrolls of fog, but keep 4-5 left for Z:5  C) use digging/disintegration to open a space in a tight corridor D) Blink out of it E) just chug !curing"

Nevermind poison clouds [lvl 6 triple school] and [the cake] miasma cloud. Anything non-poison resistant basically just died with the use of two low-level spells. I'm not even going to go into creating mutagenic clouds to polymorph your permanent allies or gathering a huge amount of mutation pots.  Granted the combo was a hell of a lot of fun.

dcss,323ask,Deadscale,3,Tue Apr 14 00:08:09 2015 UTC,"Just some input.  As far as Gargoyle Fighters goes, sticking with a 1h - Shield is a really good option, later on your HP pool is lacking, and unless you're planning on doing extended I'd stick with your Demon Whip + Shield.   Your fighting is lacking so I'd start pumping that now.   It's a shame you don't have any scrolls of immolation, as a good tactic for murdering V:5 is usually to go down, pop one when they're all surrounded, notably you'll probably want rF+++ or kill one and blink real quick if you're gonna try this or the innevitable cataclysm could blow you up, V:5's quite a dangerous place though for a fighter and generally the Abyss is a lot easier going.  If you happen to have any more enchant armour scrolls, save them up and try and find a Golden Dragon somewhere, GDA is pretty much my go to armour for the easy resists + AC.  rCorr and rMut helps for the Slime pits, and you shouldn't Reaaaallly have a problem, but once again if you're only going for a 3-rune win and feel comfortable in the Abyss I'd suggest getting it there.  The Depths shouldn't be too bad, if you're on the trunk the new monster there (Entropy? No diea, it's got an X for a tile) is quite annoying, as are air mages, out side of that there's no real trouble.  When and If you get to Zot, if you haven't got rF++ by then be wary of Orbs of Fire (although they're quite notorious for being cunts so you may have heard of them before)."
dcss,323ask,Quazifuji,3,Fri Apr 10 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"As far as Gargoyle Fighters goes, sticking with a 1h - Shield is a really good option, later on your HP pool is lacking, and unless you're planning on doing extended I'd stick with your Demon Whip + Shield.    I'm not so sure about this.  A Gargoyle's ridiculous AC more than makes up for their low HP pool in the vast majority of circumstances, and most of the circumstances where it doesn't are ones where a shield doesn't help at all (the most notable probably being hellfire, which gargoyles need to be incredibly careful around).  For most  heavy armour melee characters, a two-handed weapon is probably the better choice on average, and since gargoyles have better than average defenses I think they should Kean more towards two-handed weapons than average.  Not that a demon whip is a bad choice, especially for someone who's got their skill training geared towards it, and new players sometimes benefit from playing with a more defensive setup than might ordinarily be optimal.  But I disagree that gargoyle fighters should generally use a shield to make up for their low HP, because their AC already does that."
dcss,323ask,Slogo,2,Sat Apr 11 08:40:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'll put XP into fighting. Thanks.  Demon whip? I've been using my great maces mostly, the holy one for the demonic kinds and the crushing one for the other kinds. The great mace does more damage right? I've got enough lvls in my Maces&Flails to pull off min delay on it.  I don't have immolation scrolls on me, but I've found quite a few that I can locate if I want to. But yeah, I don't have the means of rF+++, so it's not really a feasible option right now anyway.  I've been saving up my enchant armour scrolls, so once (or perhaps, if) I find a golden dragon, I'll enchant it.  I wouldn't mind the Abyss too much if it weren't for the damned starcursed masses. They multiply so quickly, and then their shrieks suck my HP down insanely quickly.  Thanks for your input. Much appreciated. :)"
dcss,323ask,Deadscale,3,Fri Apr 10 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"You can also look into skilling up evocations while doing something like the depths then coming back for V5 with a Disc of Storms, wands, and other evocable items.  I feel like Gr's are pretty alright in V:5 as far as fighters go. You have the built in rN+ for shadow dragons, rElec for Titans and Storm dragons, and just general good defenses. You still want something to blast the wardens so you can stair dance and/or blast any summoning creatures that wander in though."
dcss,323ask,klockklock,3,Fri Apr 10 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"Demon whip is, IMO, one of the best one handed weapons in the game. If you're not going for a shield then there's little reason to go for a one handed over a two handed, but Demon whips reach a min delay of 5 which is really good. IIRC the Min delay of a Demon whip basically means you get 2 attacks off per turn (a turn being 10), and having Finesse drops that down to 3 (so 3 attacks per turn). I can't quite remember if your Demon Whip had the Electric brand but 3 hits + electric brand per turn will wreck people.  The real reason for mentioning it is that Shields are pretty baller, they're useful against most physical damage sources and can block others, if you're lucky and find a branded one they can boost a resistance, and you're not planning on doing extended so things like Hellfire and Torment aren't much of an issue for you, and Gr's have quite low HP, their GDR is what makes them so tanky but later you'll start losing chunks of life.  I never had much of a problem with the Starcursed masses, usually just Tab them down, so I can't really give much advice here. I think the bigger problem of the Abyss is the randomness for me atleast, I had a good run die there because I kept getting teleported, 1 step away from the Gate out with the Rune and it teleports me in the middle of 3 bone dragons.... fuck this game sometimes...  If you do have the scrolls spare it may be worth dipping into the Depths and seeing if you can find some GDA, just remember to book it if shit starts getting to much, with an enchanted GDA V:5 should be a cake walk aslong as you can get away from the initial horde."
dcss,323ask,Bobthemightyone,2,Sat Apr 11 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"True, considering that I've put 15 levels into shields, I guess it would be kind of wasteful not to make use of shields... and after seeing your suggestions, I did go back to using the demon whip, and getting in two hits for each one most enemies get is a real advantage. Unfortunately, the only shields I've found that have had something special about them have been bucklers, and I never identified their specialities.  I do have a NoTele ring, and when I was last in the Abyss (I've been banished once) I wasn't teleported I think. I could be remembering wrong, though."
dcss,323ask,Bobthemightyone,3,Sat Apr 11 09:10:57 2015 UTC,"Lack of rC and MR is a serious problem if you're trying the Slime Pits. Azure jellies can do devastating damage if you get a bad roll since the freezing part of their attacks ignore your AC afaik. Great Orb of Eyes don't have much trouble paralyzing you with MR+.  That -Tele ring is pretty bad.. only +3 str and +3 dex buffs are beneficial for you. Hard to believe you do not have a better ring.. I'd rather wear +3 ring of dexterity than (+3 str, +3 dex, -tele) ring.  I would wield that demon whip of elec, wear a shield and peek in the Elf:1-2 before rushing for the 3rd rune.

dcss,323ask,KingCholera,3,Sat Apr 11 09:12:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely clear Depths first. Vaults:5 is just way too dangerous without at least MR+++.. and a pip of resistance in everything (preferably two). Vautls:5 is without a doubt the areas in the entire game, extended included, where MR is the most important (shoutout to Zot:5, where it's almost as important. Less enemies with the ability to mark you). Getting marked by a vault sentinal  will result in certain death almost no matter how strong your character is. If you have trouble with Depths, consider clearing Elves:1 and 2 (NOT 3). I'd rather have a second pip of MR before elves though, just to lessen the chance of banishment.  When exploring the depths be careful of giants. They will have some nasty elemental magic and elemental weapons. Luckily your electric whip should make fairly short work of all of the most dangerous enemies (except for the very rare titan). Be very careful on Depths:5 near the entrance to the realm of Zot, draconian hordes can be quite nasty especially with low resistances.  Once you clear Depths hopefully you'll find a source of rC and MR. Afterwards I'd go and clear out Elf. A lot of players don't like Elvish Halls since they feel like it doesn't give you very much loot, but it's guarenteed loot (at at this point you need loot) and more XP for more gifts from Okawaru. Just be very careful around Elvish Sorcerer's and demonologists, their ability to use/summon creatures with hellfire makes them particulary dangerous to gargoyle's and their low hp. As long as you carefully kite the vault at Elves:3 you should be fine."

Trog will move down my list big time  He worked well before Because you could summon 1 BIA for a standard fight and you wouldn't lose too much. And Trogs Hand could be used on all of the bigger fights without much issue. But my time in Zor. I used 1 BIA early on then basically survived  on 4 pips. And was at around 3 when I grabbed the orb. Like there are a lot of monster packs in Zot. And if using Trogs hand for a fight with 4/5 dragons makes me lose piety. The ability loses it's power.

This in it self isn't a bad way to balance trogs early game to an extent, but I daren't use any abilities outside of beserk because the piety hit you take is too much, I ran through Orc and by the end I finally had more or less maxed out my piety, and I was using my abilities sparingly, I hit the Swamp and found an Ice cave where I needed a few summons due to some Gold Dragon Simulicrums (or how ever you spell it). I must have summoned 3/4 people and I was back at 4 pips, and when I left the cave I had 3 again.... Hell I got to the end of Snake pits, at the branch end before the rune, and got into a fight with the masses there (must have been around 50 dudes) and the piety loss from summoning 2 BiA and 1 Trogs hand out-weighed the 50+ guys I killed, like come on...  IMO, Trogs still a good god, but if his piety gain is going to remain this low they need to re-tool his shit. Either knock the cost of BiA and Trogs hand Waaaaay down, or stop giving me Ogre's and Trolls at 5 pips and effectively wasting a cast of it, you already sacrifice magic for Trog, now you basically roll the dice on your 1 good cast of BiA and hope you get an Iron Troll or Stone Giant...

There are a few solutions out there: 1) die to everything dangerous at least once, then learn from it. 2) treat everything unknown as highly dangerous, play super cautiously, and expend ressources everytime (this actually works, but can be a bit tedious. Use every wand, scroll, potion and deck, squeeze the last optimal animate-skeleton-play out, always retreat to good tactical positions). 3) set autofight to 50-60% in the init.txt; once you hit that treshold,  retreat and use consumables; put force_more for lots of events (esp. Uniques)    I  have been playing heavily for two years now, so I cant really separate experience gained from 1) from the other stuff."
dcss,31o0f8,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Mon Apr 6 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"I've got a few of those down, at least. Have my autofight stopped at 70, actually. I think at least part of my problem may just be pushing too hard, haha. But yah, I guess my biggest problem is just that I'm not sure when a unique is something I can handle. When it'll be 'easy' 'moderate' or 'run right the hell now if you can'. Sometimes Sigmund, for instance, is someone I need to run from, other times I just.. one or two shot him. And I don't know how to tell the difference between runs."
dcss,31o0f8,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Mon Apr 6 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are only going to get this experience by playing. But a good rule is:  uniques are very worth using ressources on, ranging from weak/cheap (wand charges) over middle/cheap (fan/phial/stone/lamp/lignification/berserk etc) to expensive (haste,might). The cheaper something is the more use it just because- anything thats rechargeable is very cheap (evocables, god abilites), as soon as you have not only potions of haste you can use it a lot more etc."
dcss,31o0f8,Quazifuji,3,Mon Apr 6 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"Well, one thing to keep in mind is that in most cases, there isn't much reward for killing uniques.  Sometimes they have nice weapons or give good experience, but rarely anything huge.  So a good policy to take is that when in doubt, don't fight them.  When you do fight them, don't hesitate to use consumables - a few potions or scrolls is obviously a much smaller consequence than your whole character.   Sometimes Sigmund, for instance, is someone I need to run from, other times I just.. one or two shot him. And I don't know how to tell the difference between runs.   Well, some of this is just RNG.  There's a lot of randomness in Crawl's combat.  Some of your characters will be better prepared to fight sigmund than others, but you could also have two identical characters fighting Sigmund and one two-shots him while the other misses 5 times in a row, gets confused, and then gets blasted by a few throw flames and dies.  This type of effect can be particularly noticeable with squishy but hard-hitting enemies like ogres or ettins.  You might have a character who can kill ten ogres or ettins in a row taking little-to-no damage, then get two-shot by the next one."

The Hall of Blades (which is always behind a runed door in Elf 2 and from the sound of it is what killed you) and Elf 3 are far more dangerous, especially if you haven't done it before.  I generally don't do Elf until I've done both Lair branches, sometimes not until after Vaults.  Many would recommend just never bothering with Elf at all, at least not in a 3 rune game and especially not when going for your first win, as the danger there often hugely outweighs the potential reward."
dcss,31o0f8,bigmcstrongmuscle,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:43:54 2015 UTC,I'd go swamp/spider first. Shoal can be worse than elven halls.  Remember that you don't have to finish each branch at a time.  Get your resists on before elf.

That's one easily-solvable problem right there. You don't need to do Elf. The nastier varieties can spawn (albeit one at a time) as shallow as Elf:1, and even a weakling Deep Elf conjurer can ruin your day if he gets off a couple multizap lightning bolts when you don't have MR. Elf is optional for a reason. After Orc, clear out the dungeon, then do levels 1-4 of the Lair branches.  As to your question, unfortunately, experience or spoilers are the only reliable tutors.

If one can think of a good background that fits the game, is appropriately balanced, and is sufficiently distinguished from the other backgrounds, and that background happens to warrant a high Dex start for whatever reason, then sure. But I wouldn't approach it as ""let's find a high Dex background."" It's better to find the best background to add, regardless of Dex.  It's also worth noting that Str is vital (to a point) for armour, and Int is reasonably vital for spellcasting starts. While pretty much every character benefits from Dex (often more than Str) very few can be argued to require a high Dex stat."
dcss,31mdno,WinterShine,3,Mon Apr 6 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"good points all in all.  What about modifying some of the backgrounds for higher dex? Say Assassin, for instance. Surely they could grab some more dex from str. It would make assassin stand out more than just a starting point with needles."
dcss,31mdno,WinterShine,2,Mon Apr 6 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, assassin is more of a melee with a couple free curare than a stabber. As such it's going to want to wear heavy armour and prioritize strength over dex in the early game. If you want to make it a high dex start, it needs to change some other way first.  It would maybe be cool for it to start with sleeping/paralysis needles and some throwing skill maybe, for early needle stabbing, but even then, the catch is that this character wouldn't necessarily need to be stealthy, and might still want to fight in heavy armour.  The real ""stabber"" background remains En, which of course wants its int."
dcss,31mdno,killdudes,3,Mon Apr 6 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"Really, the answer is probably to rework stats in general. At present, the optimal strategy for any race and any background is to put gains into STR until they're at the minimum for your planned armor, put gains into INT until you've eliminated hunger for the spells you want to cast, and only then put all remaining gains into DEX. If not for the occasional stat mutation, it would be completely mechanical."
dcss,31mdno,WinterShine,9,Mon Apr 6 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say hungerless is excessive for most combinations, especially non-casters trying to use haste or some such. There's so much food anyway that it's not worth the effort, and mostly only fail% and, for some characters, spellpower warrant consideration.  You're right about the order of stats though. It's generally str until armour ER+1 or so, then int if you're going to cast higher level stuff and dex otherwise."
dcss,31mdno,Sharkman1231,3,Mon Apr 6 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"Really? Getting gains from Dex early on would have the most benefit I would think. Most combos have at least enough strength to wear light and medium-ish armours. Spell hunger isn't that important for most races (spriggan might be an exception), Int also raises spellpower, but I don't think that's as significant as the gains from Dex. I think EV/Dodging is much more limited by your Dex, than spellpower/success is limited by Int."
dcss,31mdno,killdudes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"The real issue is that raw gains to DEX count for less than the equivalent pluses to slaying and EV - and the latter are more common on equipment than DEX anyway. There's no question that you want to raise DEX, it's just that in the early game one or two random scrolls of enchant weapon will do more."
dcss,31mdno,killdudes,2,Tue Apr 7 00:09:26 2015 UTC,Good insight.  Do you have any thoughts on how to redesign the stats?
dcss,31mdno,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. Honestly, if I were to redesign Crawl, I would try to eliminate the stats completely, offloading everything (including HP/MP gains) into skill advancement. That would be ""less random"", but it isn't really random right now anyway."
dcss,31mdno,WinterShine,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:13:10 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea to be honest.
dcss,31mdno,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:30:41 2015 UTC,"Not a direct response to your question, but it reminds me of something I've wondered.  Outside of the specialized realm of stabbing, is it possible for a high-Dex, high-EV melee character to be as strong as a high-AC character through the latter parts of the game?  I'm talking about someone wearing robes, or maybe lighter dragon armors at most.  I've certainly tried.  MfGl's for example.  I just never do as well them with as with a heavier armored melee character.  To use a GoT reference, can Oberyn Martell ever be a more effective character than The Mountain?"
dcss,31mdno,Deadscale,3,Mon Apr 6 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this. Suppose we have two characters, one EV focused, and one AC focused, but otherwise identical (HP, offence, etc.), and their EV/AC is balanced so that the average damage reduction they get from those stats is equal against some particular enemy (so maybe one has a 20% chance of being hit and takes 20 damage on average, while the other has a 40% chance of being hit but takes 10 damage on average).  While for the most part their damage mitigation over long periods of time will be equal, the issue is that the EV-focused character will be much more prone to suffering spike damage. They won't be hit as often, but one or two good hits will bring them into a dangerous HP range. The AC-focused character will take hits more often, but suffer more consistently lower damage.  This means that, once their health has dropped to a dangerous range (say under 60%), the EV character is potentially fewer hits away from dying. In the example above, if both characters are on 40 HP, the EV character will die in two hits on average, while the AC character would require four hits on average to kill. While the EV character is less likely to be hit, the AC character gets a little more ""almost guaranteed"" time as leeway (to teleport off or what have you). You're also less likely to suddenly find yourself on half health in the first place with high AC; you instead slowly get whittled down to it.  That said, EV is still very good. It scales more percentage-wise than AC (the more damage the enemy does, the better it is to completely dodge that attack), while damage reduction from AC averages around AC/2 (ignoring factors like GDR and other silliness) per attack. Conversely AC is very good against multiple smaller attacks (like hydra); if you have 30+ AC, then seven hits for 18 damage each will barely scratch you, while an EV character will likely take at least a couple of those blows. So you want EV to avoid some of those big blows from heavy hitters, but you also want AC to soften those blows that do come in.  As such, some sort of balance is often better than having one or the other extreme (though on certain races the latter may simply be what you live with). As others have mentioned, usually you do whatever maximizes the sum of AC + EV, while not interfering with your character in some other important way (spells, stabbing, etc.)."
dcss,31mdno,ryeoldfashioned,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:39:59 2015 UTC,"That's an insight I never though of.  So if a high-AC character and a high-EV character took the same average damage per turn, the high-EV character will have that damage with a lumpier distribution.  That character is more likely to die in one of those ""what happened?"" moments where you don't realize you're dead until the high score screen appears.  Meanwhile the high-AC character will have more predictable damage and is less likely to suffer the unexpected death.  Thanks for explaining that, it makes a lot of sense."
dcss,31mdno,DicemanCometh,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"Likewise, a high-EV character is more likely to have one of those ""I SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE"" moments due to luck."

Having dealt with three or four orbs of fire at this point, I'm a bit less scared of malmutates than I was earlier. Being mutation resistant plus wearing an amulet of rMut seems to protect me pretty reliably. Plus, I imagine the monsters in slime and abyss are a bit less badass than on Zot:5, and crappy treasure or no, I think a bit of extra skill XP would do my defenses a world of good.  I'm less hell-bent on ascending this character than I am on pushing him as far as he can go. I've ascended once already, and the ascension run wasn't really that difficult.

Sif seems unnecessary with the staff of energy and my massive collection of books, and I think after clearing Crypt I may have missed the boat to do TSO.

You can also try both of them out since they don't mind you switching between them (and Elv) you even keep some piety.

IE gets longer use out of theirs (and Wz is probably a bit tricky for less experienced players, since it lacks a long-term viable offensive spell in its starting book). If you go IE, I'd suggest a hybrid capable race like Dr, since you may want to switch to (some) melee early, and even if not, you'll be melee range a lot for the Freeze spell.  Or you could try some melee. I always like suggesting Mo with a powerful race, because Mo means you get to try out more god powers more quickly (you get **.... piety instantly the first time you join a religion).

As obvious as that sounds, if you get stuck with a really late temple as a non spellcaster, you have a ways to go to get spellcasting and necromancy high enough to be useful in the lair. Starting with necro lets you use the level 5 spells as soon as they appear right when you need them at the start of lair. There are some exceptions, but I like being able to be a super bad ass necromancer right from the start. It's an easy and fun style to play, and a couple skeletons can make the difference between life and death with an early Unique."

Necromancers have a variety of spells for summoning undead minions.  Some of them are permanent, although none can take stairs.  Starting as a Necromancer will give you a book with animate skeleton and animate dead.  If you worship Kiku, you'll get some necromancy books as gifts early, and eventually a choice between the Necronomicon or the Pain brand (the pain brand is usually recommended if you don't find a pain weapon yourself).  Kiku also gives you the ability to request corpses on demand for a small amount of piety, which can mean an endless supply of undead minions.  Request Corpses and simulacrum can easily produce an army capable of killing nearly anything in the game.  Yred and Beogh both give you permanent allies (who can take stairs) as gifts.  Yred gives mostly undead, and also gives the ability to summon zombies and skeletons from corpses.  Beogh gives orcs, and also gives you a chance to convert orcs you encounter to your side.  Your orcs can get promoted with experience, and you can also give them equipment (you can gift one item per orc).  If you want to try different types of characters, Berserkers are generally considered the easiest class and can be pretty fun.

So,  17 * .33 ~5.66 extra damage per hit   So now  (4 + 5.66 + 7.5)/.5 ~34.3 damage per unit time.   Bastard Sword  The speed brand always rounds up, so .5 min delay.  However, you're starting at 0 skill, so I'll do both calculations.  At base delay (1.5 normally, speed brand makes it to 1):  (15 + 6.5)/1 21.5 damage per unit time   At min delay  (15 + 6.5)/.5 43 damage per unit time.   Analysis  The dagger is easily the worst weapon of the bunch.  Low total output, low per-hit.  The Obsidian Axe is an incredibly dangerous weapon to have.  No sneaking around an enemy, or escaping combat.  The quick blade looks the best on paper, but against a high-AC opponent, it's nearly useless.  The longsword has the highest per-hit, but at the moment is too slow to be useful.  My recommendation  For now, use the quick blade, and hold on to the Obsidian Axe as a holdout last-resort against high-AC opponents.  Immediately train up Long Blades to 16, then ditch the other two weapons.  The sword is far more versatile than the other two, and will even deal more damage in a stabbing attempt than the quickblade, just based on the huge base damage."
dcss,31kc4u,DerpTheGinger,3,Mon Apr 6 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I'm really unsure, I have a character I keep in wizard mode for experimenting with. Set their skills and stats to the same as the character I'm testing for, generate the appropriate slaying rings or what have you, generate the appropriate weapons, and then run a few fsims on various enemies.   Generally do an fsim against dangerous enemies that you'd reasonably be fighting in the future, both armoured or not. For example, early on orc warriors and ogres are a good choice to see your damage versus high- and low-AC targets.  Fight sim options are in the & menu along with all the other wizard mode stuff. Just don't put your actual good character in wizard mode. If you play online, keep an offline copy of crawl to wizmode in.  Be aware the obsidian axe has the side effect of mesmerizing you when creatures are in sight (like a siren does)."
dcss,31kc4u,WinterShine,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"To test the damage of the different weapons, use the wizard mode against various enemies and compare the results.

The stat boost from Chei provide a shitton of damage boosting to blade hands. An extra 7.5 damage per hit at full piety. http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unarmed  Stat boosts also help out for statue form and dragon form, and the extra int just plain makes everything easier to cast.  Chei doesn't even frown on transmutations which increase your speed, HOWEVER, you'll still be slower than most stuff so it's of limited effectiveness.  Other good god options include Okawaru for heroism (the skill boost directly pumps your damage and lowers your delay), Ashenzari for the boosts to your skills besides unarmed and skill transfering TO unarmed (every manual is a manual of unarmed with Ash), and Mahkleb, TSO, or Zin for generally useful abilities.  Edit: Ru is viable too, just be careful what spell schools and such you give up. Dith, Gozag, and Yred are all viable as well.

dcss,31k596,WinterShine,2,Mon Apr 6 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"Most of the usual bunch are viable, Ru included. Oka is actually really strong for unarmed, because Heroism affects unarmed combat much more significantly than other weapon types (remember that UC skill, in addition to the usual effect on damage and delay, also increases your base damage for unarmed strikes).   People suggest Chei because of the stat boosts, but Chei is still a challenge god, and should be considered as such; the ability to walk away from a fight is the most powerful move in the game, and picking Chei is more likely to kill you than save you (especially before you have all of Chei's abilities up). A statement like ""If you're picking Chei, then unarmed/Tm is a good choice"" might work, but the converse ""If you're picking unarmed/Tm, then Chei is a good choice"" is not the case. Any number of other gods (Oka, Yre, Fedhas, Ash, Makh...) would all give better odds of winning than Chei.  Obviously Xom, Sif Muna, and Vehumet are out. Maybe Ely too, since it requires so much Invo and you're already stretched thin. (Not sure on exactly how new Ely works yet.) But most any other god will work as usual."

He's got 0 points in M&Flails, and a faster Base delay weapon like a Whip or a Demon Whip (11) would be better then a Dire Flail for the Pain brand.

As a caster blaster, melee or stabber, it is good enough of an item for me to completely stop training everything and train evo to about level 8-12 depending on how the situation changes. In the early game, your defensive options are fairly limited if you don't find an appropriate book, or haven't identified particular potions/scrolls (although your best defensive option, running away is still available). From an offensive perspective, it is excellent too, allowing for stabs for both melee and stabbers, and allows casters to get free shots, all chars without real retaliation threat.  I'd go all-in; it will serve you well through all of lair, all of the main D1-D15, Vaults, Orcish mines. It also basically grants you a free rune if your run has Shoals, where Iluisw, merfolk and others basically become a joke.

Use it to kill lone monsters, its not as good against packs as the spell  Stealth helps a lot, it will make you harder to detect while invisible and the key to using invisibility with high failure rate (which you can do) is to be stealthy enough not to be detected the first turn you enter the LOS of something, stepping out, evoking it until success and then going in an fighting. With this method a failure rate of about 50% is manageable, letting you train your main skills  Invisibility goes well with short blades, but it has huge benefits regardless. You still get distraction stabs, it is easier to run away and some enemies won't be able to target you (eg: can't be drained by ghost moths.) Use it whenever you something dangerous without SInv"

dcss,31b51w,Sharkman1231,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't affect my play very much typically, but it would depend on the exact circumstances. Training some evoc is never really a bad idea when you have useful wands. 10 would be too high pre-lair. If I have a wand of paralysis and not using a strong combo like MiBe, I like to train evoc to about 10 by mid lair in order to paralyse uniques, spiny frogs, mambas, hydras, making them easy and safe to kill etc. Wand of paralysis has a bigger impact on my strategy than evocable invis."
dcss,31b51w,zxc223,0,Fri Apr 3 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't affect my playstyle at all. Evokable invisibility has low success and will cause glow even in failed evoke attempts. If I have absolutely no choice, I'll try it... But most of the time running away is the better choice"
dcss,31b51w,Cryp71c,6,Fri Apr 3 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"Evokable invisibility has no penalty for failure, meaning it's still useful at like 75% fail rate in situations where wasted turns don't matter.  You will not glow for a failure.  If I'm playing a melee character I find it very useful to pop the invis before going down some stairs, even with crap stealth you can usually get a stab in if there is a monster within a few steps."

dcss,31ah4o,SvalbardCaretaker,6,Fri Apr 3 08:27:03 2015 UTC,"That was most likely before shield reworking. If you are playing >=0.15 shields are okay, and while a lot of the best players still say that a bigger stick to killdudes is better, some players report better winrates when using shields. For reference, right now a point of shield is a bit less effective than 1EV."
dcss,31ah4o,gopack123,5,Fri Apr 3 09:01:42 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on if you want to 3 or 15 rune. For a 3 rune a shield is a big help. It will greatly improve midgame survivability. For a 15 runer I think aiming for maximum damage output is more important. You should probably be aiming for the highest base damage weapon of whatever weapon class you have chosen. Hellfire, torment, fire storms, smites and glaciates are not going to respect your shield."
dcss,31ah4o,cybersaint2k,4,Fri Apr 3 18:43:48 2015 UTC,In extended much damage comes from sources that cannot be blocked such as torment.
dcss,31ah4o,pereza0,3,Fri Apr 3 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"There are three types of shields: Bucklers, Regular Shields and Large Shields.  Examining a shield will tell you the skill needed to remove its penalties. Once you have removed the penalty on the shield you intend to use it is generally not worth it to keep training the Shields skill.  Large Shields are also generally not worth it unless you are a race that can use them more easily, they require lots of exp which is better invested elsewhere"
dcss,31ah4o,mrzisme,1 point,Fri Apr 3 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"One of the easiest 3 rune victories I've ever had was a MiBe with a large shield and evening star weapon (strongest 1hander).  The large shield completely negates so much incoming damage its unreal.  It shouldn't be underestimated.  On my exit, there was a moment when I was surrounded by executioners, 3 pan lords and and an ancient lich lobbing crystal spears.  That took me down to 3/4 hp by the time I killed them all."
dcss,31ah4o,pereza0,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"As a MiBe you can afford the huge exp better than most other combinations.  No Invo, mindelay on one-handers is reached in seconds and good aptitudes for everything you will need"
dcss,31ah4o,Sharkman1231,2,Fri Apr 17 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"I think some of it just boils down to personal preferences. I personally really like them, but I know I do less damage than if I had a nice 2-hander. They are better than they used to be, that's for certain. They're also for certain less useful in extended, unless the shield is giving you something like {rN+,rF, etc}."
dcss,31ah4o,zxc223,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:06:12 2015 UTC,"Shields are pretty good. I like the eveningstar + buckler combination the most, and is nice for a 3 rune win. Normally I would use a great mace unless I find an eveningstar or a demon whip with a good enchant. SH brings different benefits to EV, though it works similarly. Against certain enemies like orb guardians, SH is especially good.   For new players, stick with the biggest 2-hander you can find. It is a more straightforward way of playing, and very strong."
dcss,31ah4o,nospamkhanman,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"A buckler with resists is a good find for many characters and they currently only take 4 levels to get rid of the shield penalty. For most characters that's not a big investment.  If I'm playing a magic character, I'll almost always wear a buckler with an enhancer staff.   For a melee character I'll usually play with a buckler for maybe half the game until I find a killer 2 hander that I can't pass up."

As it happened, I was doing well around mid game when something banished me.  I figured Xom penance was relatively safe compared to the Abyss, so when I found an altar to Lugonu I switched.  I only used ""big"" Lugonu abilities a couple of times.  I corrupted Spider:5 to get into the rune chamber without fighting my way through a long hallway, and I might have banished myself once to get out of trouble (but now I'm thinking that might have been an earlier game that I lost).  I never banished anything.  For me, the really nice thing about Lugonu was that I didn't have to worry about the Abyss anymore.  I got banished like six times crawling around Elf:3 with no magic resistance, but it was just a minor annoyance instead of a death sentence.  And I was able to go after the abyssal rune knowing that if things got dicey I could just depart the Abyss and try it again later.  In particular, that meant I could get into Zot and finish the game without taking my chances on any of the ""hard"" runes.  Edit: Just checked the morgue file, it was Louise on Shoals:3 that banished me, forcing me to switch to Lugonu.  I came back and killed her 22139 turns later."

For example for a melee character with 45 AC, elf blademasters and ghost moths are no big deal. For a caster they can take you down quickly.  For a caster with 14 AC, they can take you down very very quickly.  On the flip side, once you have a decently high leveled caster it's really nice because you don't fear the 1 tormentor behind a pack of enemies, you can usually kill them from afar with a spell of some sort."

Pretty much try and get throw icicle online as fast as possible. It will get you through lair easy, and pretty much most of the game until bolt of cold is good to go. Bolt of cold will easily get you through the rest of the game and it doesn't really take much to get it castable. It also synergizes well with air magic that HEs have a good bonus in. Having a back up type of damage is always helpful and freezing cloud is awesome in the vaults. I have taken on the welcoming party a couple times with some HEIEs of vehemet and it was easy peasy. The ice armor spell is pretty nice if you go straight spellcaster, and the good dodging helps a lot with that so you can focus on dodging and use the spell for armor. Honestly it's just a fun class to play. The only real trouble I have are undead, and its not hard to find a holy branded weapon they have skill in somewhere."
dcss,31aza1,clamsarepeople2,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"It is harder but you're certainly experienced enough to have a shot at winning. Be more cautious, pay more attention to how mana affects how you pace fights and resting. If you can make it to a rune you'll be in good shape for a win. Conjurers make good casters which can branch out, I like Fire Elementalists because of conjure and inner flame. Merfolk Ice Elementalists are a great hybrid race because their +3 to dodging and +4 to polearms make it possible to get a decent weapon to min delay with minimal investment, and they have +1 for Ice and their spellbook also offers some good utility like a Fire Elementalist."

dcss,31asue,SirKrieger,4,Fri Apr 3 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'd be careful following a guide. They can often be outdated and focus too highly on strategy while neglecting tactic.  Make sure to use whatever items you find useful when you're in a pinch rather than saving them for later. As far as this specific guide is concerned, I've found a few points I'm in disagreement with.    Training Spellcasting at 66% and Earth Magic 33%   Spell failure is reduced much more by the magic school specific to that spell than it is by the spellcasting skill. The spellcasting skill does reduce failure rate and increase spell power a little, it's main purposes are giving you more spell levels so you may learn spells and decreasing spell hunger. You should be focusing on your killdudes skills at the very beginning of the game and not how many more spell levels you can get. Getting sandblast to a decent power is your #1 priority.     Only following Vehumet.   Dungeon Crawl is a game of survival and thus following a strategy to rigidly, ie waiting until the Ecumenical Temple to follow  Vehumet rather that choosing Mahkleb when you found the altar on D:1 is a poor choice. Having the assistance of a god earlier on as long as they aren't a horrendous choice for your character is extremely helpful.  One last bit of advice. Don't base your character around having any specific item, you may never find one until much later in the dungeon or even at all. I've got a draconian in the Depths and I still haven't found him any hats :(  Best of luck and keep at it! You'll win soon enough I'm sure!  Edit: For formatting :)"

When item weight got removed, the devs apparently didn't think to fix the interface for armor and weapons.  Personally, I do pick up all the trash clubs and robes, at least at the start, because without weight limits there's no reason not to fill your inventory, and because having lots of worthless equippables acts as a way to deflect mummy curses.

dcss,3199vy,Disnof,2,Fri Apr 3 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"Necromutation is good in Zig because it helps stop you from getting slaughtered by curses in mummy floors or torment in some Pan Lord floors.  It's useful in extended in general mostly because of its torment immunity.  It has some other features that are useful as well (hungerless casting, cold resistance), but torment immunity's the main reason it's popular.  But it's a massive experience investment to get online, and it also has the huge downside of not allowing potions, which can easily get you killed if you aren't wearing clarity and get confused.  Overall, it's extremely debatable whether it's worth the experience investment for extended, and almost unquestionably a massive waste of experience to try to get it online any earlier than Pan/Hell/Tomb.  As for this character, I've never had much luck with Octopodes, but there are a few things I see that you might want to consider:   You're using a one-handed weapon with no shield.  Probably at least worth grabbing a buckler, especially since you're squishy as an octopode not swimming in rings of protection. You really don't need both glaciate and fire storm, especially for a character with only 2 runes.  Whether even getting just glaciate or firestorm online is worth it in a 3-rune game is heavily debatable.  Whether it' worth getting both is an unquestionable no.  The level 9 spells are awesome, but a really big experience investment, and you can do just fine with spells like bold of fire and freezing cloud.  Although in the case of those particular spells, they actually synergize pretty terribly, since freezing clouds block bolts of fire. While I wouldn't bother with necromutation any time soon, animate dead might be worth considering.  The zombies make nice meat shields, which helps confiscate for your squishiness, and you can shoot bolts of draining through them without hurting them.  Freezing clouds also do very little damage to them and won't anger them.  Any of your other spells will damage and possibly turn them hostile, though.  Death's Door and Bjorg's are also the two best emergency spells in the entire game, so those are also worth considering if you decide to train some necromancy. In the latest version of 0.16, using one lamp of fire turns all lamps of fire in the game inert, and the same for other elemental evokers, so there's no reason to carry more than one lamp of fire or phial of floods.  Just carry one of each. I might prioritize dodging or fighting over anything else right now.  Like I said, I've had trouble getting much success with octopodes, so maybe I'm wrong, but it looks to me like this character's biggest weakness is defenses, and your fighting is very low."
dcss,3199vy,Quazifuji,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"Well i would never use statue form on a DE, but an octopode is a completely different. Unless you find a bunch of rings of protection, there isnt many other sources of AC besides transmutation spells."
dcss,3199vy,Quazifuji,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"True, the problem is that if you cast spells in statue form you're essentially reducing your damage by 33%, which is quite dangerous.  There may be circumstances where it's worth it, and statue form is definitely good on an Octopode as a way to let you kill enemies for little to no mana cost, something every caster should have by mid game so they can kill popcorn or finish off low health enemies without spending large amounts of manage while making larges amounts of noise.  But I think statue form needs to be used very carefully on a caster like this, as there are many situations where being in statue form would do more harm than good.  Also, they've got some ice magic training, so Ozocubo's armour could always be an option.  Nowhere near as defensive as statue form, but not nearly as risky either.  Or Stoneskin if they decide to train more earth magic."
dcss,3199vy,Quazifuji,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:56:21 2015 UTC,i dont know what you mean by reducing dmg by 33%. can you explain more?
dcss,3199vy,Disnof,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"Statue form makes every action take 50% longer.  It boosts your melee damage by 50% to make up for this, but unless there was a buff I missed, it does not give any similar boost to your spells.  So in statue form your spells take 50% longer to cast while doing the sane amount of damage, so you do 33% less damage per AUT with your spells."
dcss,3199vy,chowriit,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"ahh! makes perfect sense now. I see that statue form is a fall back for my octo. I just use stone skin now and I'm getting 12 AC... for an octo, that's pretty good. When I cast stoneskin I'm getting 43 AC."

I had more trouble, as expected, in V:5 and had to teleport a number of times to break the pack, but I don't remember being in serious trouble there either. I took extra care not to let my HP fall too much while under penance. I think Oka was mollified just about the time I cleared V:5.  The switch was definitely worth it though.

The trick is to not give them space to surround you and to not give them endless turns where they torture you and you cant hit them.  As for your char: dont walk around in zot with rcX. Dragons and draconians will wreck your shit. See if you can find a nice onehanded alternative to that dwhip, freezing/bashing/antimagic would be great, for orbs of fire (search for evening stars). ID those wands of hasting. Be super extra cautious in Zot:5, a few mistakes will kill you. Spend your evocables liberally, its the last place you are going to need them, and will safe your life if used early.   As for Zot:5 as dweller of lugonu you could try to corrupt the level and ninja the orb in the confusion, but you are a tank and should be able to clear it."

Seems like I'm in a better spot now, nearly omni-resistant and with a few more tools.  I picked up a scroll of silence and ID'd the hasting wands, wish I had more silences, but that was all that was left.  Updated dump."

dcss,3165dm,GobbopatheFR,2,Thu Apr 2 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, I have an rC+ ring that I was using, but swapped it for the rN++ specifically to go after that curse toe (mistakenly thinking that I could significantly mitigate its damage with the rN++).  So even with my other equipment making me cold vulnerable I can at least get to ""cold neutral"" wearing the other ring.  My ""fun"" plan for Zot:5 has been to get close to the chamber, corrupt my way into the chamber, then scroll of immolation + all my evocables, hoping that the ensuing chaos and explosions wipe out everything, but it just occurred to me that the neutral abyss monsters might turn hostile if I start exploding them/everything around them.  So I'll probably just follow the strategy that's served me through the rest of this game, and carefully lure monsters around corners and into corridors in small groups."
dcss,3165dm,WinterShine,3,Thu Apr 2 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"Torment is what halved your HP pool, and no resistance is relevant here. Some nasty mobs share that f....g ability, and curse toe is one of them."

Torment does takes off 50% - 5%*(level of rN) of your HP, so at rN++, op would have lost 40% HP instead of 50%. Not terribly effective of course, and usually doesn't make rN worth carrying for torment.  OP's case, a ring with {rN++ SInv}, is something of an exception of course, since it's two ticks in one item, and you probably want to carry around an SInv ring anyway, so why not that one. Edit: Well, OP has a hat with SInv, but still."

It's not even an especially creative way to die."

[...] Each manual has a limited amount of extra XP they can provide: once that amount is reached, the manual is destroyed."
dcss,3165dm,wormsalad,2,Thu Apr 2 13:06:54 2015 UTC,"My preferred method is usually to spend as little time in Zot as possible. Ideally I have some ?mapping left (I see you only have one), which I use to find the down staircases more quickly and skip most of Zot:1-4. Even without mapping, I'd say move carefully, slowly clear an area near the upstairs (make your 'safe area' wider all around) and try to clear a safe path between the upstairs you started from and whatever downstairs you can find. Don't feel obligated to fully clear every level.  On Zot:5 just play super carefully. As long as you get rid of that rC- (pick a different shield, probably) you should be able to manage. Your dwhip{flame} won't be a great weapon against orbs of fire unfortunately (and only one !might to boot), so be really careful there. If you have any other dwhips (slashing, maybe freezing) it might be nice to carry one around. Shield won't help much against OOFs either (fireball definitely ignores SH, and I think penetrating beams like bolt of fire might too), so carrying a great mace to deal with them would also be an option, since you've got more than enough training for it.  Zot:5 is definitely a place to practice ""back away and fight somewhere that other enemies aren't likely to join the fight."" Yes, orbs of fire are fast enough to nuke you while you're backing away from them. But you still should if you're in a situation where you're at all able to, because you don't want your OOF fight to become two OOFs and an anicent lich (fireball is loud).  By the by, if you need to teleport to escape in Zot:5, you need to do it early. You're as likely to teleport into even more trouble as not. Once you've initiated the teleport, do things like buff yourself (haste) or heal wounds while you're waiting to teleport (or, if you're in a situation where you can, just move out of view or act in such a way as to prevent more damage) so that you're more likely to survive upon landing.  Last thought, your consumables don't look ideal for Zot. Have you per chance left some stuff on the ground? Scrolls of silence turn ancient liches from deadly threats into punching bags. Potions of cure mutation would be handy to carry; I'd rather wear the rF+ amulet against orbs of fire than the rMut one, even without curemut, but curemut would make that decision even better. Invisibility is handy against some enemies as well (all (I think?) draconians, most dragons)."

They take up roughly half the level (probably a bit less), so having consecutive teleports into there is almost certain to happen if you teleport in Zot:5 often enough. It's just a combination of clustering illusion and human tendency to remember the things that went horribly wrong more vividly than the things which turned out kinda okay.  Edit: Assuming 50/50 odds of teleporting into (or very near) the orb area, there's still a >1% chance of six consecutive teleports there. It's not super surprising that it can happen."

Even when this     option is set, autopickup of those items can be disabled from the     \ menu once the game has begun.  pickup_thrown = true     pickup_thrown = true causes autopickup to pick up thrown/fired     missiles, which can make life much easier for hunter types. Be     aware that autopickup uses a turn, though it won't trigger if     there are hostile monsters in sight.  explore_greedy = true     Greedy explore travels to items that are eligible for     autopickup in addition to exploring the level, but is     otherwise identical to regular explore. Explore greed is     disabled if autopickup is off (Ctrl-A).  explore_wall_bias = 0     Adjusts how much autoexplore favours attempting to discover room     perimeters and corners. At higher values, autoexplore will more     heavily favour visiting squares that are next to walls; at 0 it     will not favour them at all.  easy_eat_chunks = false     If this is set to true then when using the (e)at command, the     game will automatically determine the oldest chunk that is safe     to eat, and eat it without prompting.

Autofight is important because the default is too low. If you get under 60% health, it's time to run, not to Tab harder.  Show more I like to disable because I hate having to click through messages all the time while playing someone with minions.

The pickup aux armour is very nice, since it's super easy to completely miss it sitting there on the floor. It kinda broke for a bit in one of the later 0.16 versions, but I'm pretty sure I've got the one in my rcfile fully working again.

Use an identify scroll on your wand of invisibility. Shoals, especially shoals 5 becomes significantly easier with a source of invis against Iluisw and crew. You have sufficient MR to withstand mesmerise.  Ring of flames is soso, on one hand it will increase your spellpower with Fireball, but is consuming a large portion of your spell levels. I'd amnesia scroll it and opt to learn utility based spells to complement your offense, as OoD/Battlesphere/Fireball is sufficient firepower. Some nice utility spells are Summon Butterflies, Swiftness, Regeneration, Haste, cTele. But I can't find any books in your char dump. Then if you want, learn ring of flames again once you get firestorm online and running (although firestorm realllly doesn't need more power to be effective).  It's kinda late for a lajatang if you've cleared Lair 1-8 and up to D:15. You also have no enchant weapon scrolls, so the lajatang is really lacking in power. I'd just stick with Staff of power + shield, and hope to pick up a staff of energy of energy or a crystal ball. For the most part, I'd just avoid combat when out of MP, and switch to lajatang when needed, such as dispatching silent spectres.   Also: Do at least elf:1 to try to find books/jewellery.

dcss,312mvf,Elkling,4,Wed Apr 1 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"Crawl is very adaptive. There is no real one way to play the game, and you need to change your play depending on what is given. Here are some basic tips though.  Start by training Stealth. Level it to level 2, then switch it off.   Level Fighting to level 5-6, and switch it off. Fighting will help bolster your starting hp, (hp is one of the best defenses), and improves both melee and ranged accuracy, along with melee damage.  Pick up stones. Use stones on basically everything. It softens up creatures, and lures a single mob away from a pack of mobs, such as gnolls and orcs - hitting them with a stone makes them come toward you rather than shouting (aka attracting the whole mob pack).  Look for branded weapons - or good base damage weapons that don't need much investment. For the most part, these are daggers of electrocution (rare), whip of electrocution (rare), morningstars (from orcs), quarterstaff or lajatangs, and venom branded weapons.  Find a god ASAP. For beginners, I'd recommend Trog, Mahkleb, Fedhas, Dithmenos or Ashenzari.  Train Bows. It is already on a fairly high level from the get go, so just train a few points into it, about level 8-9, before stopping. Your bow will basically be there to take out key targets, such as early gnoll encounters, adders, orc priests, and uniques.  Get dodging to level 6, and preferably level 9-10 before entering lair. Get Evocations to 5-10. Then level bows until you find some nice spells to get along with it, such as portal projectile.  For stats, Dex = Dodging, Str = Wearing heavier armour, Int = Casting spells. I'd highly recommend getting Dex - it is good up until 24 or so Dex, and is basically a guaranteed form of defense with Dodging levels."

This is the right move probably >75% of the time - you only want to move toward things that outclass you at range, such as centaurs and orc priests, and then only in certain situations (most of the time your best move is away from them to draw them around a corner so you have favorable LOS, leaving them fewer turns to shoot at you, or to just set an exclusion over them and let them sleep).  The third makes TAB give you the ""you are too injured to fight recklessly!"" message at 75% HP, which is a good point to stop tabbing and start thinking.

Dex = Dodging (Diminishing returns after 24 dex), Str = Wearing heavier armour(more ac or able to cast spells in heavier armour), Int = Casting spells in general.   Even so, you can't really screw up with stats too much - sure you can minmax, but all stats are helpful for a large majority of characters, where at worst, upping a stat can just be used to counteract stat loss later on in the game (e.g. upping int as a minotaur of Trog)."

You want to focus on weapon skill early, but usually you hit the point where it's worth training some defenses before you hit min delay.  Also, are you training short blades or just fighting with them?  Short blades probably aren't the best melee weapon for a bow user, since it's a waste of your offhand slot and short blades are generally pretty crappy unless you're stabbing or get the right brand (elec, distortion, or pain, generally, but unless you're worshipping Lugonu or training necromancy just elec for a HEHu).

I lost a good character because I was paralyzed by a Sphinx on sight with rC- and suddenly a frost giant appeared out of nowhere.  GDA and your artifact plate armour can both be good choices. The plate armour only if you can fix your MR issue. If you choose the GDA you might be able to get rid of your large shield with rPois and use a better one without rC-.  Make sure your evocable blink is at a fail rate that does not make it too dangerous to use.  Flaming on your demon whip is not optimal. Might be good to rebrand it if you can take the risk. As your maces & flails skill will allow you to use eveningstars at mindelay, those are very good alternatives to your current whip depending on their brand.  You have SInv twice. Since you only have found your first rune, I assume rN++ is not useful yet. You should have used that rC+ ring instead. Even if you are hoping to make use of your scrolls of torment, you could still swap rings before reading one.  Make sure all of Lugonu's abilities have a low failure rate. I'm not sure this is the case with your 3.8 in invocations.  Are you using manual training? Why are spellcasting and UC on? If you train 8 skills, then there is something wrong most of the time.

dcss,30wld1,zigs,9,Tue Mar 31 08:12:18 2015 UTC,"Many reasons.  They are the most accessible end game weapon bar none. You will basically always encounter ogres, whom all have a G(S)C. This is unlike other late game weapons, such as triple swords and executioner axe's, which are far and few in between.  They have much lower skill training required to reach min delay, only needing 22, instead of 26 for executioner axe, 24 for triple sword, 26 for bardiche, 26 for triple crossbow e.t.c. And out of all of these, the G(S)C still has the highest base damage.  High base damage means brands that add a percentage bonus damage (flaming, freezing, vorpal) to be significantly better.  Finally, the two classes, being Ogre's and Troll's that can use G(S)C's have the best defense in the game - a +30% intrinsic hp bonus. They still get a large benefit from leveling up dodging, even if they are a large size.  If you go to extended and for 15 rune runs, basically everything that is dangerous basically bypasses shields - and their only real defense is avoiding them in combat, straight up having more hp (basically no real way to increase your hp pool outside of class/fighting skill), and killing them asap."

In close combat being able to kill anything in a couple swings or little more is a very huge boon and actually reduces the amount of damage you take.  Also, races that can wield GSCs have fairly large HP pools.  In the early game a lower delay weapon could be better, though. Letting opponents swing twice is never a good thing."

It's very nice in extended, but not mandatory.  There are several ways to deal with a lack of rMut.  Zin is definitely one of them.  Zin is also just an extremely strong post-game god in general, as good as TSO.  People often switch to TSO first for the holy brand, but you can definitely switch straight to Zin, or go TSO, grab the holy brand, and the switch to Zin.  Jiyva also gives help against mutations, but Zin's the more straightforward option.  Xom also theoretically works, but is even less straightforward.  Another option is just to be careful around mutating enemies and conservative with your cure mutation potions.  Most mutating enemies (neqoxecs, cacodemons, shining eyes) are very squishy.  If you carefully avoid giving them LOS and kill them extremely quickly when they do get it, you can often avoid getting mutated.  Mnoleg and OoFs are tanky and mutate, but you don't fight either of those much.  You'll probably pick up a few mutations this way, but most mutations are mode inconvenient than crippling and don't really need to be cured urgently.  If you've got 2 or 3 cure mutation potions, that's usually enough to handle any really bad mutations you pick up.  This might not work as well if you've already got a lot of mutations, have a really good one you don't want to lose, or just don't have many cure mutation potions (you can sometimes get some in a Zig, but you obviously have to be careful there)."

Easier way to go is definitely to switch straight to Zin, donate all your gold to him and start training invocations.

dcss,30ugly,MolotovDodgeball,3,Mon Mar 30 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"Bit disappointing that the very first point is wrong. Crawl isn't designed around balance (try a GrFi vs. a MuWr), and the unstable equilibrium is definitely a thing (The more you play the more likely you are to win)."
dcss,30ugly,triorph,3,Tue Mar 31 01:28:14 2015 UTC,and the unstable equilibrium is definitely a thing (The more you play the more likely you are to win).   I don't think that's an example of unstable equilibrium.  That's just an example of people getting better at the game.
dcss,30ugly,TungstenYUNOMELT,3,Tue Mar 31 09:17:20 2015 UTC,"Unstable equilibrium is the more you succeed the easier it is to continue succeeding, because you have advantages (more loot, XP, new powers, less consumables used, less damage taken, etc.)  That definitely exists in Crawl, and the game does not try to avoid this (for example, you don't get fewer healing potions if you take less damage, you don't start getting better drops when you're struggling)  An example of working against unstable equilibrium would be the Half Life series where the amount of ammo and health you get from crates is based on your current health/ammo status, ensuring you always move towards a middle ground of resources that the game can be balanced around."
dcss,30ugly,DrStalker,2,Tue Mar 31 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"Unstable equilibrium is the more you succeed the easier it is to continue succeeding, because you have advantages (more loot, XP, new powers, less consumables used, less damage taken, etc.)   Crawl doesn't work like that.  A skilled player won't get more loot, XP or more powers than an unskilled one assuming they are at a similar depth in the game.  Take two random characters that reach Lair.  They will be very close in xp and any loot differences will mostly be down to lucky finds.  The game design actively discourages grinding to a point that it is sub-optimal.  Damage is easily recuperated by resting so there is no accumulated advantage in taking less total damage (except for edge cases).  The only way for an unskilled player to have less power than a skilled player at the same character level is if the unskilled player screws up his skill-build completely or makes bad equipment choices, but that's strategic failure, not an equilibrium failure.  The only resource that you are really able to pile up in crawl is consumables but paradoxically veterans are more likely to run low on consumables since unskilled players will often be stuck in a hoarding mentality and not use the consumables when they should.  Besides that consumables aren't critical to success in the game and they certainly don't make the game trivial at any point.  From the article:   ""In a single-player game, [unstable equilibrium] can create a situation where early advantages accumulate to the point where the game becomes very easy later on, while early mistakes make it harder and harder to recover; this can make the game boring for more skilled players and frustrating enough to drive away everyone else.""   This simply isn't the case in crawl.  Take the rankest beginner, have him play crawl, use whatever resources and do whatever he pleases with the caveat that he has to use the games default skill generator.  As long as he doesn't die, he can hand his character to a skilled player at any point and the skilled player will have a fair chance of completing the game."
dcss,30ugly,TungstenYUNOMELT,1 point,Wed Apr 1 08:42:17 2015 UTC,"Race/class choice is intentionally a difficulty level choice, so it's dubious to say that reflects lack of balance. If you choose an easier difficulty level the game should be easier. Balance problems would be if obtaining a particular level of skill/weapon/armour/other item trivialized the game (or in the hands of an enemy, trivially wrecked you).  I'd agree that unstable equilibrium is a definite part of Crawl."

I had a two-win streak (TrMo/Yre, HuGl/Fedhas), then a few deaths, somewhere around which time I found out about the double damage bug. Between that and being busy, I kinda petered out.  Yredelemnul was pretty fun though. I rarely ever pick him (I think it just doesn't show up early very often for me), but his abilities can be really powerful if used effectively. Recalling a screen full of gifted minions will finish off most anything until about Zot. He wasn't so useful there, but with a haste wand and a stack of might potions, a 27 UC troll (with that unfortunate double damage bug to boot) doesn't have all that much trouble dealing with Zot:5.  HuGl was fairly fun too. Got to play some with Passage of Golubria (I'm not as impressed as others seem to be though). I think I acquired fruit three times in that game, so I kinda went ham in Zot:5 with oklobs. Six in the first chamber of the orb vault, plus oklobs between chambers and outside the orb room.  That orb run was a little interesting. I got abyssed on D:3 by a random pan lord on its first move (go figure). After getting out of there and taking another route around, I found a pack of orcs with enough priests that they were noticeably affecting my HP lol. I'd mostly skipped D:3 early in the run thanks to them.  My score is in part due to Hu (128 pts) and Fedhas (95 pts) being worth a lot more than I'd have expected."

I was only interested in the Octopode Nemelex's choice combos - I've been trying to win all Op combos so Neme's choice meshed nicely. I splatted the shit out of Op Summoners, Op Arcane marksmen, and finally won an Op Warper. I did my tried and true strategy - Pick up ru, sac tentacle, pump unarmed and rush dragon form once I was able to slap everything to death.    My second win, well.. DEAr was the most recent Neme Choice, and the tourny was nearly ending. I hate DE but I love Artificers because wands can actually kill things, so I gave it a shot.   This is hands down the oddest run I've ever had. Within the first 3 floors of the dungeon I think I had 11 AC/EV, a +2 leather armor of rF+, and a dagger of venom which is basically a free ticket to lair. Despite DE's inherent squishiness I had a ton of defenses so early and between venom and evocations could kill anything. Venom for living things, enslavement and flame for anything immune to venom, and random effects when I was feeling lucky.  So, of course, I came across a runed spear and wield ID'd it - Distortion, Lol. DE suck at polearms and armor so at this point I'm like ""fuck it"" and went full retard and picked up Qazlal. If you don't know what qaz does, he nullifies your stealth and creates a constant explosion of clouds around you which synergizes great with tanky classes, and is the exact opposite of what you want for a squishy DE. So I'm running around with no stealth and no spells, poking the shit out of everything, stuff's blinking everywhere and everything is just a giant cloud of explosions and blinks  it was just a mad run. I did learn that Qaz's invocable elemental summon synergizes with ring of flames and lamp of fire to where you can use one or the other and then invoke a swarm of fire ele's, so that was cool.   By the late game I had a demon trident of elec, which can barely kill anything later on. I totally skipped zot 1-4 and was so weak in zot 5 to the point where I was actually relying on box of beasts to kill orbs of fire and tentacled monstrosities. Without evocables the character would have been useless. Also after picking up the orb, I teleported into a lung chamber, and then teleported directly back into the orb chamber lol.   All in all, a fucked up but fun run."

dcss,30rh0h,WinterShine,12,Mon Mar 30 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"By orc, enemies are usually popcorn enough that you don't have to worry about it. (Also, many casters have picked up a weapon by then and maybe even trained it some to pick off weak enemies like vanilla orcs are by that point.)  I'd probably have to see what you're doing specifically to know why you're running into more enemies than you'd like. Generally stepping several steps backward before engaging is the right approach though. Anything more specific depends on what background you've chosen.   Strategically, you can recall how you train melee characters -- offence first, then defence, switching back to offence as needed, and tertiary stuff only when offence and defence are sorted -- and apply that rule roughly to casters as well. Offence first -- whichever starting spells you need to have in order to safely kill things. Then defence, which, depending on your book, might involve magic and dodging or just dodging. Then some fighting for extra HP, and back to offence whenever needed. You probably have a lot of your starting book memorized before you train any dodging. (Ex: Cj will want battlesphere, IE will want ice beasts, etc.)  Here's a brief primer on the backgrounds and how they play early on.  Cj is the all out ranged blaster of the book starts. You generally want to back up a bit (in part to keep your battlesphere in front of you, so it can hit the enemy if you're in a narrow hall), and then blast the enemy to little pieces from afar. Dazzling Spray blinds, which makes it both a great offensive and defensive tool. Battlesphere and magic missiles can nuke most things through midgame.  FE is not a blaster in the same way; it trades the raw ranged offence for a more tactical selection. FE uses conjure flame in narrow hallways to block paths, and then picks off enemies from across the flame. Some brave/dumb enemies will step through the flame, meaning you can ""body block"" them in the flame and watch as they nicely crisp (assuming you can survive in melee with them). FE's best offence is the melee range Sticky Flame spell though; you cast it, and start walking away as the enemy melts. Just be aware you're squishy, so the one round you stand in melee range to cast it could get you really hurt (which is really bad when it doesn't finish off the enemy).  IE is almost a melee character in disguise. Ozo's Armour gives you defence that the FE doesn't have in order to stand in melee range and destroy things using your amazing never-missing AC-ignoring Freeze spell at melee range. It will remain strong for a long time. You can survive with Freeze and Ozo's long enough to get ice beasts online, which is how you will kill or run away from stronger enemies. As such, when you find an enemy you're planning to Freeze, just play this character as though it were melee, and Freeze was its sword. This character has to sit in melee range much more than the FE, but Ozo's and Shield make up for it if you pick foes carefully.  AE I'm a little less familiar with. What I do know is that Static Discharge is better than one would initially think it is (like Freeze, it always hits, even vs invisible), and shouldn't be underestimated. You also get Swiftness, which even post-nerf is a great tool for walking away from normal speed enemies. Be careful about using Lightning Bolt, it'll wake up half the level.  VM is all about hitting things with poison first, and then walking away from them. This has the nice advantage of seeing whether or not they'll die from your attacks before they enter melee range with you (something Cj can also get away with to an extent). Mephitic may be able to keep them at range, but just be aware that it's noisy (fireball-tier noise). VM are stronger early game than a lot of the other book starts because of the effectiveness of poison against early enemies.  EE I'm basically totally unfamiliar with, so I'll leave that to someone else to advise on.  Necro should be considered melee with a book, and summoner is kind of its whole own sort of beast. Wz gets a collection of utility/defensive spells for the most part, so it requires a lot more tactical understanding of the starting book to really be effective with. Its starting book doesn't remain offensively viable for too long."

dcss,30rh0h,ventricule,2,Mon Mar 30 15:44:54 2015 UTC,Do you have any advice regarding invocaton/evocation skills?
dcss,30rh0h,BacchusReborn,5,Tue Mar 31 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"Invo is reasonably straight forward -- with pretty much every god, you always want to have at least enough invocations to use whatever abilities they're giving you right now at a reasonably low fail %, but probably not more than that early on. Later, once your offence and defence are solid, you can put more into invo if you're with a god that benefits from that (like Makhleb). Many other gods (like Okawaru) never need more than a little invo.   Exactly what counts as a ""reasonably low"" fail % varies a bit -- you don't really care if it takes a few tries to use Yre's animate dead (since you're not doing this in combat much), same with Oka's heroism at first (since it's a buff you should use before combat), but you really want Lugonu's bend space or Elyvilon's divine protection to work first try, since you're using those in emergencies.  Evo is usually what I'd term a tertiary skill. It's something extra you can grab if (a) the dungeon has given you a nice selection of items that would benefit from it (a few evokers, a nice rod or two, a big selection of wands and/or recharge scrolls, etc.), and (b) you can afford to train something other than pure offence or defence for a bit. Evocation items tend to be quite powerful, and most characters will benefit from training some evo eventually, but the average character doesn't want to worry about it very early (bar Nemelex, of course, where you follow the invo advice above for evo instead).  All that said, if the dungeon drops you a couple amazing rods on D:2 or something, picking up evo can actually work as an effective ""killdudes"" skill, and you don't necessarily need all that much training to make some of the rods quite effective on early game enemies."

dcss,30rh0h,BacchusReborn,4,Wed Apr 15 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"Play as paranoid as possible. Train a single killdudes skill to the exclusion of everything else. Consider Stealth your AC. 9 ranks will enable you to sneak up on many solitary monsters from D:1 to Lair:8, and -- more importantly -- will encourage monsters to forget about you as you run away to replenish mana. Worship Vehumet.

dcss,30rh0h,bigmcstrongmuscle,3,Tue Mar 31 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"I've never won with a caster, but I can usually get up to the Lair branches with a Conjurer, Fire Elementalist, or Wizard (in increasing order of difficulty). Deep Elf is probably the best straight caster, but less frail races like Demigod, Gargoyle, High Elf, Demonspawn, or Draconian aren't bad either and are a little harder to kill if you screw up.  Rule 0: Big groups of monsters run out your MP, and that is bad. Do everything to can to fight only a few monsters at a time and reserve some MP for your escape attempt. Having more MP ready is the single best way to increase your lifespan. Play carefully and a ring of magical power will practically be a free ticket to the midgame.  Rule 1: Never run towards monsters into unknown territory. There could be more monsters there. Instead hit them with a rock or a spell, then retreat into previously explored spaces. Funnel enemies into corridors if you can. Not only does that let you fight them one or two at a time, but you can annihilate them with Searing Ray, or wall them off using Conjure Flame.  Rule 2: Don't do anything without a full MP bar. Learn to love the 5 key.  Rule 3: If you are below half your MP, try to escape and regenerate them - closing doors behind you will do the trick against monsters with no hands. Pillar dancing is not ideal, but can work in the short term.  Rule 4: Carry many items, throwing weapons, and an easy melee weapon to fall back on when you do run out of MP. You will try your hardest, but it will happen, guaranteed. If you have the aptitudes, Spears are choice for FE and Wiz (for reaching past flames), and Dagger is good for Conj and Wiz (for confuse-stabs), but there's no need to be picky - aptitudes don't matter when you have 0 weapon skill. Avoid weapons with accuracy penalties if you aren't training them.  Rule 5: If you have anything other than melee to fall back on, ""Not being next to monsters"" is a more valuable defense than AC or EV.   Skill-wise, the trick to those three classes (Cj, FE, Wz) at first is to train ONLY your main killing skill until you can cast your attack spells reliably. Don't get distracted by other options, and don't train Spellcasting unless you actually possess spells you could memorize with the extra levels. Your kill skill for those three classes is pretty much going to be Conjurations. For a FE you also train Fire (You boost your casting chance and spell power most efficiently by keeping your Conj and Fire skills even). As a Wizard, you want a few points in Poison/Air for Mephitic Cloud, but not that many - let Conjurations do your heavy lifting early on. Once you have an easy time killing monsters and your fail rates are <5%, train up your Dodge skill and the skills for your other spells. Maybe even skill up an easy weapon if you want.  Conjurer is mostly about single-target blasting. Searing Ray is a mainstay that can kill most anything up until you get Battlesphere. Dazzling Spray confuses multiple monsters, which makes it great for getaways and fighting hordes, but it's not really that reliable a debuff to use on, say, uniques - you'll need to hit them a few times to be sure it'll work. Battlesphere and Magic Missile is one of the best combos around in terms of efficiently killing single targets.  Fire Elementalist starts out much like a less efficient Conjurer, but transitions into AoE blasting. It also has some really useful tricks up its sleeve, like sealing corridors with Conjure Flame and using Sticky Flame to kite monsters to death. Smart monsters won't walk into Conjure Flame (which lets you spear them or throw stuff through the fire till they die), while brave or mindless ones will waltz right into their burney doom. You can use that to your advantage by standing right next to the fire and letting them cook in it while they attack you.  Wizard is all tricks all the time, and it requires a bit of finesse to skill all those different utility spells. Don't bother with most of them until your main kill spells are doing their job well - use your items instead. You will lack high-damage spells until you find more spellbooks, so carry attack wands and whatever other means of killing you can find. Call Imp is a very flexible spell that I find provides not only extra attacks, but a more reliable way to escape a crisis than Blink does.  God-wise, don't be picky. It's better to start gaining piety fast than it is to get the perfect god. If it looks even remotely useful, give it a shot. Vehumet is a top pick for any kind of blaster. Gifts aside, Sif Muna is top-tier just for being able to quickly recharge your mana. Qazlal is really fun for anyone who can Conjure Flame, but especially if you are a FE. Ashenzari is great for anyone but especially cool for Wizards. Dith, Fedhas, Lugonu, Makhleb, Kiku and even Okawaru are all worth a try."

dcss,30rh0h,pigmyninja,3,Tue Mar 31 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"Just a small nitpick, Dazzling Spray causes blindness, not confusion. It causes the enemies to treat you as though you were invisible (and you get the same stabbing bonus as if you were invisible, which happens to be the same as stabbing a confused enemy). When it's used on a player (by a ghost who had the spell), it causes confusion instead, since players can't get blindness. (As the learndb points out, this is pretty terrifying, because a ghost can chain confuse you with it, and it does damage at the same time.)  I 100% agree on not being picky about gods. I think a lot of people focus too much on trying to get a specific god, and end up either dying before the altar shows, or dying because they don't have much piety by D:9 since they waited until very late to pick. Also, it's just more fun trying a bit of everything, most of the gods work with most every build, and have some very unique and interesting abilities that change up the game."
dcss,30rh0h,TungstenYUNOMELT,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"Good point on Dazzling Spray.  I've never actually been sure just what the difference between the two statuses is, honestly. How does it work, exactly? I know the enemies get the penalty to hit for you being invisible, but they visibly missteps fairly often like confused creatures do. Is that just them occasionally guessing you are in the wrong square?"
dcss,30rh0h,Wrenky,2,Tue Mar 31 04:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe that's how it works. I think blinded enemies won't do some of the other things confusion causes, such as damage themselves, swing at their own allies, or fall into deep water or lava, though I'm not 100% sure on any of that. Also I know some enemies will fire spells at invisible players (if they're aware that the invis player is there), which confusion would outright prevent.  Also, since according to learndb it functions as though you're invisible, I'd suspect that heavy armour characters will have the same problems that they do with invis, in that the enemies can work out where you are fairly easily based on noise anyway. Probably not relevant for anyone using Dazzling Spray, but one of Zin's recite effects can also cause blindness."

dcss,30qufx,Piginabag,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"Unless things have just changed in 0.16, flying changes how trample works. If you're not flying, enemies will never trample you into deep water, lava or permanent flames, though they can trample you into shallow water or clouds. If you are flying, you can be trampled onto water or lava, and if it's temporary flight you can fall in if you lose your buoyancy. It's generally better to land even if you have permaflight, because you will only take trampling damage if there's an opportunity for the trampling monster to trample you, and landing restricts that slightly. For the same reason, if you have to fight full elephant herds, it's useful to try and manage the individual elephants so that they are opposite one another and can't trample you at all."
dcss,30qufx,killdudes,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"Wait, trampling does extra damage? My perception always was that it does less damage than a normal attack. Maybe that's because elephants can trample only once but attack multiple times otherwise? Wild guess."

dcss,30qufx,killdudes,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:57:21 2015 UTC,There is no such thing as 'trampling damage'. Trampling does not do extra damage.  Bonus note: you can't get knocked into deep water/lava if you have flight that's about to expire. The game really does try not to instakill you!

Don't go any deeper than Abyss 3 unless you have to.  If you have no rMut, be very careful around Neqoxecs, Cacodemons, or Shining Eyes.  Kill Wretches Stars quickly - the mutations are only temporary (they go away with experience like draining), but can still become a problem if you get too may.  If you have any source of regeneration, use it.  Abyss is more a test of endurance than anything else.  Lost individual fights are pretty easy, and even the rune vault, while sometimes nasty, is rarely as bad as what you typically encounter on Vaults 5.  The thing that makes Abyss dangerous is the fact that it's very difficult to rest and you're often there for quite a while.  Also, if you have a ring of teleportation, it's often the best strategy to just wear it all the time until you find the stairs or rune vault."
dcss,30qs1f,triorph,3,Tue Mar 31 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"I think abyss/slime are both easier than vaults:5, so if you've got that you should be strong enough for both of those. That said they are still dangerous and you'll need to know roughly what to do. If you're going to the abyss, have a big stack of tele (or preferably a ring of teleport) and use it frequently when things go bad. An amulet of regen is also nice for minimising your downtime. Go down to abyss:3 but try not to go any deeper."
dcss,30qs1f,BacchusReborn,2,Sun Mar 29 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"Slime. There are plenty of ways to take down the Royal Jelly. I've done Slime as a SpAs without rCorr, and although stairdancing and resting to fix my equipment was tedious, it wasn't particularly hard. TRJ fell to a single stab. Meleedudes with the usual complement of buff potions make short work of him. You can also read a scroll of vulnerability and apply your favorite debilitating spells to him, or hit him once, blink away (uncontrolled), read a scroll of immolation, and kill him with a chain reaction explosion of his jelly pals. The tactical learning curve from Vaults:5 or Zot:5 to Slime:6 is not steep.  Abyss is another candidate. Once you learn which monsters need to be killed (I'm looking at you, starcursed masses), and which can be safely ignored and should be walked away from once it enters LOS (almost everything else), finding the abyssal rune is mostly a function of not falling asleep due to boredom as you dive to Abyss:3 and wander around. Abyss is only dangerous if your visit is unplanned, or if you get careless."

Hence, from a strategy perspective, I would have to think that mutagenic chunks and potions of mutation are a bad idea (unless you've got spare cure mutation potions that you don't mind burning, which may be the case if you're only planning to 3-rune).  Beneficial mutation I'll generally quaff, unless I've got a really nice helmet and no cure mutations. (Helmet is the only armour slot that can be removed by a level 1 mutation -- to remove hat, gloves or boots always requires a level 3 mutation, which means at least 3 quaffs.)

I'll eat a few chunks if I'm playing a melee focused char as, imo, the good mutations are more likely to be helpful to melee chars while the bad ones are more endurable.

dcss,30mmlz,Deadscale,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:49:55 2015 UTC,"His other guide is also quite good  A few weeks ago I was looking into finally winning with a character and while reading gargoyles seemed really good. And after my first and second win with them I found this guide abd tried a Mage. I suck at Magee.  I was thinking of posting a guide for a 3 rune victory GrBe to help newer people. IMO Gr is so much better for newer players then Minotaurs because of this simple fact it removes a lot of the luck element.  The hardest part (Atleast for a Gr melee) is around D:3-5. Orc Priests absolutely wreck Gr'a. But once you've gotten past that hurdle they're great. Innate rPois and flying mean both lair branches are do-able without relying on gear. rElec is nice to have. And immune to rot and petrify remove 2 mechanics aswell  Arguably though. Grs are a bit of a crutch. Once you've gotten used to free rPois. Flying and rElec it's a pain playing without those for free again. But the same can be said about other races too (Dat troll regen. No hunger clock on mummies etc) so one could also argue it's better to learn with less to think about.   I just hope they don't get nerf'd.

It's kind of a shame they lost their Fang Attack / Talon, because IMO If i was going to add anything I'd add Claws / Talons / Fangs to make them more like how Gargoyles are depicted in fantasy as we know them, and it would make Unarmed a nice option for them, but can't really balance around that because theirs no sun light to turn them to stone, and no food clock would be too OP"

dcss,30mrh7,GNG,3,Sun Mar 29 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"That's an exaggeration. While I would agree that int is more valuable than dex in general for anyone casting spells over, say, 2nd-3rd level, it's perfectly viable to have Haste castable in FDA with 15 int, 17 Charms, 12 Spellcasting, for example, numbers that are absolutely viable in extended."
dcss,30mrh7,WinterShine,3,Sat Mar 28 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"In extended? Sure it is. You get more XP than you could dream of in extended. I wouldn't want to try to haste in plate on a mino in a 3-rune game, sure, but if you're wandering through dozens of pan levels trying to find Cerebov and company, all that XP you gather up en route will more than suffice.  To put the aptitudes in perspective, a Minotaur (-4 apt, worst in game) gets to 17 Charms a little faster than a Human (0 apt) gets to 23."
dcss,30mrh7,WinterShine,2,Sun Mar 29 00:54:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, well that rules out a lot of good armour then.   Fire, Ice or Pearl Dragon Armour would be options.  And by putting all your stat gains into Int, you're not going to have as high an EV as you'd like to make up for your lower AC.  Is Haste awesome enough to make up for lower AC & GDR?  Or is a non-caster tank with CPA or GDA a better bet, even for extended?"
dcss,30mrh7,WinterShine,3,Sun Mar 29 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"No, because you can caste Haste in plate or heavier if you need to, so there's no reason to compromise your armour. It will just take longer to get online, but if you're doing extended, you're gonna have a lot of extra XP to spend on that. Having more Int certainly helps though (more than Dex would in all likelihood).  Edit: nago's post here is an example of Haste castable at 10% fail rate in CPA with 18 int, 18 Charms, 6 Spellcasting]. Access to swappable wizardry may also be an option (for buff spells at least)."
dcss,30lqun,clownskull,7,Sat Mar 28 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Did you get that Lair vault with a Vestibule entrance in it?  Normally those only spawn in Depths,  but I know there is an end Lair vault that has one.  Either way, the Vestibule is an incredibly dangerous place for a level 14 character who just cleared Lair, and the fact that you killed Geryon is actually pretty impressive, so good job.   Will it bring me great demon summoning powers, or is it kind of bad?    It summons Hell Beasts, which have a chance to be hostile.  The more evocations you have, the more hell beasts, and the more likely they are to be friendly.  I've never used it much, seems like it could be nice at high evocations but nothing too exciting.  When you use it it goes inert like an elemental evoker and needs to be recharged with experience.   I also have an iron rod, if that matters. Would enough scrolls of recharging make a shotgun minotaur build possible?   I've never used an iron rod, but I've heard they're quite good.  You don't necessarily need scrolls of recharging to make them useful, though.  Rods recharge automatically over time, and switching weapons only takes half a turn, so you can pretty easily open a fight with the rod and then switch to the axe when the rod runs out of charges and rest until the rod's recharge for the next battle.  You need a pretty huge collection of wands and rods to make a full evocations build without worshipping Nemelex, but training some supplemental evocations for utility if you find some nice evokables can be a good idea on any character.  With a good rod on a minotaur, I would definitely consider training some evocations, it's mostly just a matter of when.  Without your char dump, I can't tell you whether I would train it right away or focus on other skills for now but grab some evocations later.   My current weapon is a fairly mediocre battleaxe of venom, and I can't think of anything notably awesome about my character.   Assuming you found the Vestibule in Lair and didn't randomly dive into Depths, a battleaxe of venom is a perfectly reasonable weapon to have around the end of lair.  You'll probably find an upgrade soon enough.  If nothing else, you can get a battleaxe of freezing from a frost giant in vaults or depths, and a battleaxe of venom is good enough to survive until you get that far."
dcss,30lqun,Quazifuji,2,Sat Mar 28 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the advice, both of you. I really appreciate it.  Yeah, it was in the Lair. It was really cool and immersive, finding a weird wizard's temple down in there. I wish there was more stuff like this in Crawl.  Geryon was pretty hard to kill, he kept running away and putting hell beasts between the two of us, and I had to deal with the random undesirables attracted by the noise until I backed him into a corner, since I'm too slow to chase things down. I ended up quaffing a potion of invisibility and might to get him.  I left a ton of elemental evokers lying around on the ground, I'll probably go back and collect them and capitalize.  I'll report back on whether the iron rod ends up being awesome or not, but I think I'll invest in some evokations if only for the novelty.  I'll post a chardump when I get the chance. I'm sure there's some kind of hideous flaw in my character that will inevitably get me killed."
dcss,30lqun,Quazifuji,3,Sat Mar 28 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was in the Lair. It was really cool and immersive, finding a weird wizard's temple down in there. I wish there was more stuff like this in Crawl.   There are quite a few flavorful vaults, I think they might become more common as the game goes on.  That's one of the cooler ones, I think.   I left a ton of elemental evokers lying around on the ground, I'll probably go back and collect them and capitalize.   Elemental evokers are really good, besides maybe stone of temors.  Especially if you're playing in version 0.15, where they recharge separately (in 0.16, all evokers of the same type recharge together (so you can basically only have one of each)).  Don't underestimate the power of a high evocations lamp of fire, fan of gales, or phial of floods in the right scenario.   I'll report back on whether the iron rod ends up being awesome or not, but I think I'll invest in some evokations if only for the novelty.   I think this is a good idea.  Part of the fun of Roguelikes is the fact that you play them so many times and they change every time you play.  When you get a relatively unique opportunity, like having an early rod and horn of geryon, I say go for it.  You can play a standard MiGl anytime you want.  You don't get many chances to play a MiGl that runs around shotgunning guys and summoning hellbeasts.   I'll post a chardump when I get the chance. I'm sure there's some kind of hideous flaw in my character that will inevitably get me killed.   That's often the case, but that's why getting advice from experienced players is helpful.  I've gotten help from better players tons of times, and still do plenty of the time.  One thing I will mention, not necessarily for this character, but for future reference: if you're a fan of Chei, I might consider going with more versatile races than a Minotaur.  Chei's biggest feature is the stat boost, and the biggest benefit from the stat boosts is generally its effect on your spellcasting.  Lots of int makes your spells a lot better, and lots of str means heavy armour is less of a problem, so Chei users can often easily cast mid-to-high level spells in plate with way less training than other characters.    If you're playing a race that kind of sucks at magic, like a Minotaur, you're not really getting you're money's worth from Chei.  The str and dex are still nice, and Chei's got powerful actives, but the slow move speed is a really, really big downside.  Having magic on a Chei user also less you shoot at guys from range, which makes your lack of mobility less bad.  Chei in general is considered a very weak god (many consider Chei a challenge god), even on characters that make very good use of him.  This isn't to discourage you from playing this type of character of you like this type of character, and some very good players do amazing things with Chei worshipers.  Chei's got a unique playstyle, and some love it while others hate it.  I'm just letting you know that most wouldn't advise Chei when going for your first win, and if you are going to play Chei, you might have more luck on a more magic apt race (Gargoyles, Hill Orcs, Vine Stalkers, or Merfolk are all great choices if you want a strong race for a character who's primarily melee but can pick up spellcasting more easily than a minotaur)."
dcss,30lqun,Quazifuji,2,Sat Mar 28 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"So as long as they're all different types, I can catch 'em all? Awesome.  I'm definitely a fan of novelty. Maybe too much. Oh well.  I just recently tried out Chei with a HOGl and loved it. That character is actually my only one to ever get a rune (snake pits), I decided to take a break before something horrible happened. I went with a minotaur because they have a great aptitude for axes and I didn't want to just play the same thing over and over again. Axes seem to work really, really well with being too slow to run away from crowds of monsters. Any suggestions for particularly good axe wielding Chei species aside from orcs and minotaurs?  Edit: Speaking of hybridization, I'm probably going to try to get Olgreb's Toxic Radiance online and hope it's good for the Spider's Nest. I have access to Corpse Rot, too. That sounds promising. Kind of."
dcss,30lqun,Quazifuji,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"So as long as they're all different types, I can catch 'em all? Awesome.   Yup.  You can have as many different elemental evokers as you want in any patch where they exist, although they only recharge one at a time.  If you're in 0.16, duplicates are useless (all evokers of the same type go inert whenever you use one), if you're in an older version, you can carry around duplicates and they'll get used and recharge separately.   I'm definitely a fan of novelty. Maybe too much. Oh well.   No problem with that, I'm a fan of novelty too.  Trying wacky builds is fun, and a big part of the fun of Crawl is the number of different types of characters you can make.  There's no reason that you have to play optimally.  I'm just letting you know that Chei in general, and especially a Chei worshiper with no magic, in very non-optimal.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't play with Chei, just letting you know that you're potentially making things harder for yourself.   Any suggestions for particularly good axe wielding Chei species aside from orcs and minotaurs?   HO is definitely the most obvious choice, between their awesome axe and invocations aptitudes and competent spellcasting.  Gargoyle could work.  Their axe aptitude isn't anything special but it's not bad, they've also got very solid spellcasting aptitudes, and they're just an incredibly strong race in general with their ridiculous bonus armour (low HP, but in most situations armour negates that, the biggest case where it's a problem is hellfire, but you don't see much of that in a 3-rune game).  Demonspawn and Vine Stalkers could also just work as fun races with very well-rounded aptitudes.  Demonspawn take some time to ramp up but it's really fun seeing what mutations you get every game, and Vine Stalkers are deceptively tanky due to guardian shield and their fast healing and antimagic bite are extremely powerful (although you're pretty squishy when you run out of mana and have to be careful with no heal wounds).  You could also try centaur.  Not great aptitudes for what you're going for, but not terrible, and a centaur of Chei isn't quite as slow as a normal race of Chei (although still very slow).   Edit: Speaking of hybridization, I'm probably going to try to get Olgreb's Toxic Radiance online and hope it's good for the Spider's Nest. I have access to Corpse Rot, too. That sounds promising. Kind of.   I've never tried that spell much, but I think it can definitely be very powerful in Spider.  Also, poison needles are fantastic in spider even with no skill investment, especially against orb spiders.  Corpse Rot is hard to use and I've never really used it, but I've heard it can be very strong if you know how to use it well.  Miasma clouds are incredibly powerful, but obviously only being able to cast it on copses is a big limitation.  For a Chei worshipper, I would strongly consider getting some basic charms and translocations like blink and repel missiles, which both help make up for your incredibly slow speed.  Ranged attacks are also very nice for situations where moving towards or away from an enemy is too dangerous, of course."

As for your HEWZ... uh, I dont really know how to say this, but your stealth is absurdly high,(I would have stuck at 12, with 22 you can pick up dagger and stabbing stuff)  and compared with spellcasting you main damage skill is very low. And why is spellcasting enhanced by Ash? That has never happened before O-O   You want shield skill at 15 with normal shield, to eliminate penalties.  Armour: you have 4 strength, leaving you not really a lot of options. Since you have good dodging, its not necessary, but if you plan to melee a lot more see if you can find mottled dragon hide? You might want to put 1-2 points in Str in that case.   Weapon:  Well, having cursed weapon has exactly two effects with Ash: faster piety gain (irrelevant for most chars with maxed out piety) and skill bonus. If you dont melee anyway, you dont need weapon boost... And for a mostly blaster char likes yours ability to swap is better than having 4 skill points more in weapon.  See if you can find a very good weapon (evening star, any demon weapon, double sword), and then carefully consider brands/scrolls of ?Enchant weapon.

dcss,30itkp,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Fri Mar 27 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"And why is spellcasting enhanced by Ash?   Boosting spellcasting comes from binding a magical staff that doesn't benefit from evocations (energy, wizardry, power, conjuration).    You want shield skill at 15 with normal shield, to eliminate penalties.   Actually, if you don't care about it affecting your melee, 11 shields skill is enough to eliminate all spellcasting penalties from a standard shield on a normal-sized race. See here for all the numbers.   That said, with +2 aptitude, OP will probably want a good long blade eventually (unless they find a great non-long blade worth training for... not like Ash makes it hard).

dcss,30exhp,skulblaka,5,Thu Mar 26 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're overvaluing the +5 on the falchion and undervaluing the weakness of falchion as a base type. Its very likely that a scimitar, would have shown up with decent enchantment (say +2) which would have been a better one hander choice. Ideally you would want a demon blade of a double sword but admittedly they are both rare. You definitely should have used the great sword over the falchion though, as your damage would probably have been at least two times as much. Consider not investing so much points into shields at the start, to make the two-hander switch feel less painful."
dcss,30exhp,triorph,3,Thu Mar 26 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think that Falcion is a poor weapon for snake.  The enchantment is good, but Vorpal is inferior to flame or frost in terms of damage and the cold resistance is of minimal use in Snake.  It swings fast, and is accurate and may well have been good in Spider for that reason,  against lots of fast high ev enemies.     In Snake you really want to hit hard.   Especially against Nagas, Guardian Serpents, Anacondas and other beefy targets.   Your great sword I think would have helped you more.  You also fell into the trap of focusing solely on Armor and neglecting dodging.  You should be training a mix of both when wearing medium armour.  Yes that armour is very good,  but scale isn't the best ac, so benefits less from armour skill levels, and gives less hindrance to EV.  Your survivability would have been much better with a mix of the skills better suited to the armour you were wearing."
dcss,30exhp,akaean,2,Thu Mar 26 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I would have rather had heavy armor, but I couldn't find any that wasn't inferior to the god gift scale that I was wearing. Same goes for the weapon - I was working on building up that flame greatsword, but I was very, very reluctant to give up my shield, especially after 15+ skill levels worth of investment into it."

I note that you had scrolls of blinking and teleport, and a teleport wand with four charges. This suggests you weren't paranoid enough.  One piece of concrete advice I can give: you had two unidentified scrolls in your inventory. By the time you get to the Lair branches, you probably should read-ID any scroll you come across."

dcss,30exhp,zarzak,2,Fri Mar 27 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"Since tactical scrolls are (practically) useless until you identify them, brand weapon and enchant armor (for making dragon armor) are the only scrolls you might worry about wasting. The former risk can be mostly mitigated by always lugging around the best base weapon type you've found even if it's brandless, and the latter is common enough that it only really matters for trolls and such that really want that armor ASAP."

dcss,30exhp,Sharkman1231,3,Fri Mar 27 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"""AoE"" damage in melee range means you're doing something wrong. Cleaving is used when you have poor positioning. I'm going to take a quote from a Tavern thread that sums up my position.   There are four ways to think about the quality of a weapon class:   Damage/speed - Axes as a group do less damage than other weapon types at each quality level. XP efficiency - Axes take as much or more experience to get working than comparable weapons in other classes. Availability of good members of the class - Battleaxes are easily available, but they are the only acceptable axe that is. Special abilities - Axes have a special ability that only works when you are positioned badly, either intentionally (boredom + cleaving), avoidably (bad tactics), or unavoidably. The first two categories can be totally eliminated by the player, and the last doesn't come up very often unless you worship Xom, and even then rarely in a way that advantage axes.    In every category except availability, axes rate quite badly, and even availability isn't much better than other weapon classes (great swords, which have +1 damage and require two less skill levels, and great maces, which have +2 to damage, are both readily available).  Unless I find an early exceptional weapon or am stabbing or have extreme aptitude disparities, I will go M&F every time, because I can guarantee that I will have strong one and two handed weapons available with a variety of brands, and spend no more than 20 skill levels."
dcss,30exhp,monkhouse,2,Fri Mar 27 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"hey, any chance you have a link to that thread? the whole weapon selection game thing is a bit mysterious to me, i always end up just using whatever artifact shows up first."
dcss,30exhp,DicemanCometh,2,Fri Mar 27 11:44:01 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, here it is. It's mostly about axes though. Unless your aptitudes are not good with them, M&F is never a bad choice. If you have an aptitude that is much better than the others, that's probably your best choice (Merfolk, High Elves, Hill Orcs, etc). For something like Kobolds, if I'm not playing a stabber, I'll go with M&F over Short Blades. They have a +3 w/ Short Blades, and 0 w/ M&F, what's nice is they can still use eveningstars one-handed. So because the base damage of the most damaging short blade is really low (7), I'd go with good maces and flails."

I'll quote Lasty from a tavern thread on the subject: Right now humans have weapon, shield, 2 rings, amulet, helmet, cloak, gloves, boots, body armour (10 slots) and octopodes have weapon, shield, hat, 8 rings, amulet (12 slots).

dcss,309zqc,qntl,3,Wed Mar 25 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"Normally at this stage you finish Dungeon, and then you have to do the two easier Lair rune branches. Looks like you've got Spider and Shoals to pick from. Without rPois or Clarity, Spider is quite dangerous, but Shoals is pretty much always dangerous, so pick your poison there. If there's rPois (maybe in a shop) you've missed somewhere, grab that and do Spider first.  Your biggest problem is going to be dealing with Trog's wrath on top of everything else. It's nasty at the best of times, and you're not as strong as you'd normally like to be when dealing with it. You're going to have to burn a lot of stuff to escape when he decides to send trouble at you. It's XP based now -- whenever you gain XP, Trog might act several turns after -- so it's more likely to happen during or after a big fight. As such, try really, really hard to not be fighting multiple things at a time. (Unfortunately, Spider and Shoals are both pretty bad for this.)  As for Lugonu, its abilities are pretty strong. Don't forget you have Bend Space; it costs a little HP, but sometimes a random blink can save your life. Banishment is very effective against low MR targets, and some of the heaviest hitters can occasionally be low MR. I believe 0.16.1 already has the feature where when you target a hex or hex-like effect such as Banishment, it tells you in the message log the odds of it successfully affecting the enemy, so keep an eye on that.  Lugonu's Corruption ability, once you get it, is pretty devastating. It can kill most uniques in a pinch, I just used it to eliminate Mara as an example. Very strong. Also nice for clearing rune vaults. Catch is, it can only be done once on any floor, so while you should still use it when it's effective, you should keep in mind that if Trog wrath strikes you won't have it handy. Distort branding your demon whip would be a good idea. It's better on a fast weapon, and you can use the eveningstar against enemies you don't want to accidentally blink to range. (You can use corruption in the temple -- or any place with a few altars in a close radius -- if you need to make a Lugonu altar to corrupt a weapon at.)  Use the enter the abyss ability as a last resort only. It will get you out of whatever danger you're in, 100% guaranteed. But it will drop you into the Abyss at almost-dead HP, and may well put you in a spot surrounded by ancient liches. Use with caution.  Regarding your training, you're currently training every skill you have. I would turn off everything but Invo until you can use all the abilities Lugonu is granting at low fail percentages. You have enough Maces to use that eveningstar effectively, so keep that off. Drop the large shield and wear that +4 shield of protection instead, the +AC is worth it, and this way you don't have to train more Shields either. Then, once your Invo is good enough, you can focus on defences and Fighting (with that sweet manual)."
dcss,309zqc,WinterShine,2,Wed Mar 25 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed suggestions.  I forgot to mention the shield, but I was actually curious about that too, the tradeoff between the large shield and the +4 (non-large) shield.  I'll heed your advice and proceed cautiously…  Abandoning Lugonu to worship Trog again would be a bad idea, right?  I seem to recall doing that once, after using Lugonu to get out of the Abyss, and being immediately thrown back into the Abyss as a result (though the wiki doesn't mention that punishment specifically)."
dcss,309zqc,WinterShine,3,Wed Mar 25 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"It's partially because 25 skill is a huge cost, and partly because the bonus AC on that shield is probably as useful as or more useful than getting more SH.

Several of my examples are just gratuitous but there are some situations in the early game where immolation is the most effective option. For example, I would have had absolutely no way to kill the frost giant in the ice cave without bottlenecking him into an immolation explosion. You can also easily blow up high ranking orcs if you can confine them into a hallway and use their allies as bombs. Hallways are a great place to immo as it forces all the monsters to move through the flames, and its easier to avoid cooking yourself.  Most characters at around level 10 or so can survive the initial explosion and like 1 turn while standing in fire without any rF, and once you pick up some rF you take a lot less damage from the burn."

So no, quickblades get half the dagger stabbing bonus, but still a significant bonus compared to non-shortblade weapons."
dcss,307zmd,Weeksy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:03:13 2015 UTC,"From the changelogs:   Weapons other than short blades & felid claws are all now equally good at stabbing.   Daggers still get a bonus though, as laid out here:   Short blades gain the biggest damage multipliers from stabbing attempts, and also provide a bonus to damage before the stabbing multiplier is applied. This extra damage is significantly increased if you are wielding a dagger, but is capped at 30. With sufficiently high skill and dexterity, other short blades[weapons] can also hit the cap. To get the maximum bonus you need to have DEX × (1 + (Weapon skill + Stealth skill/2)) > 350 with a dagger or 700 with another short blade[weapon]. Even without this bonus, short blades are still the best for stabbing.   (Ignore the short blade specific text, the wiki page hasn't been updated to the 0.16 change described above)."

dcss,307zmd,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Wed Mar 25 06:10:11 2015 UTC,"really depends on your character. If you are a maxed stealth Sp, 10-12 in SB will allow you to reliably stab almost anything even with QB. There are some high HP uniques that have survived stabs without daggers; notably saint roka and nikola, but to be on the safe side just stab uniques with daggers in general.   If you are eg. of dithmenos and have gone soft on stealth,(like <15is) then after some point QB will leave survivors. But you'll notice in time."

As for hoping for distortion, it's my favorite brand. It's a flat damage brand, so better on faster weapons such as demon whips, and I just plain enjoy the blinking/teleporting/chance to banish."

dcss,306x9m,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"Well, simply, I disagree. On a faster weapon I consider distortion top notch. I've won with a hand axe of distortion before. (cleaving and distortion is a fantastic synergy if you get swarmed)  Antimagic is situationally amazing, but useless otherwise, and has a pretty big downside. Vampiric is situational as well, and becomes less and less useful over time. Speed is always a solid brand, and if I were going 2 handed I would definitely stick with Trog hoping for one.  As it is though, I'm skilled for one handed mace with shield. This means a demon whip. Since demon whips are pretty fast as well as having decent damage, that leaves elec, distortion, or converting to a sacred scourge as my best options."
dcss,306x9m,LipsAre,3,Wed Mar 25 02:00:03 2015 UTC,"I find that even on Lugonu worshippers I want a non-distortion alternative by about the midpoint of the game, because disto becomes too dangerous against some enemies. You really don't want to blink certain enemies to range. Vaults is a good example: Vault sentinels and convokers, yaktaur captains, liches. All things you don't want to give free range on you.  Sure the damage and banish on disto is great as a brand, and if you're actually with Lucy it's worth using the whole game (against the appropriate enemies), but I really don't think that in a 3-rune game it's worth abandoning a god in order to brand a weapon to distortion. It's just not so much better than the other, more common brands that it's worth invoking the wrath of Trog (or whomever)."

Also, just because an axe helps with fighting 4 or 5 enemies at a time doesn't mean that's a good idea.  Basically, you probably should have avoided those enemies, or woken them up with a stone and then lured them into a hallway."
dcss,305vr1,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"Battle axes have a much lower stabbing bonus than shot blades (unless you have boots of the assassin).  On the other hand, don't underestimate the usefulness of Stealth or Dithmenos even if you're not getting stabs.  Stealth lets you be much pickier about which fights you take and when and where you take them, and Dithmenos is actually one of the most versatile gods in the game.  Shadow Step and the stealth bonus are best on stabbers, but the enemy accuracy penalty, bleed smoke, shadow form, and especially shadow mimic are all good on basically any character in the game.  Try going a troll or ogre of Dithmenos sometime.  Large rocks with shadow mimic is ridiculous."

A glaive is maybe not optimal for a hybrid unless you're a merfolk but that one looks pretty strong so I would just keep training it until you swing it at least at 1.0 aut (14+).  And get more dodging and fighting for tankiness.  As for spells, dispel undead and agony are very strong.  Normally I would pain brand a weapon when going kiku but you have a decent end game artifact which I don't think you can pain brand or cast excruciating wounds on.  I guess you could stop polearm training at 12 and switch to a pain branded spear.  Then you would have more room for spell training and a good reason to pump more necro.  If you do keep the glaive then spectral weapon is pretty darn strong though.  Edit: agree with others that you shouldn't train polearms to 20 quite yet because of xp costs so I removed that."
dcss,3040se,TungstenYUNOMELT,4,Tue Mar 24 08:50:28 2015 UTC,"This for sure. Necromancy has some incredibly strong support spells. Raising undead to help with fights/make meatshields to escape, regeneration to recover quickly after fights and make you slightly more durable, Dispel undead and bolt of draining for ranged attacks, Vampiric draining to keep your health high while dealing with medium level threats (vault wardens come to mind), Death channel to keep insane momentum when clearing out a floor, and pain brand weapons are devastating in the hands of a necromancer  I don't know if training to min delay is worth it at this early stage, since that'll take skill 20 in polearms, but It's definitely worth getting to delay of 1 at 14 skill."
dcss,3040se,Bobthemightyone,3,Tue Mar 24 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"That glaive is awesome! You should learn spectral weapon and use that while you evoke your glaive from behind your minions. Necromancers tend to do well with hybridization, don't be afraid to branch into other spell schools to get some utility spells. I would get spectral weapon online asap and then start training polearms and dodging. You won't be as powerful or as bulky as a full on melee character so you'll need to be sure to take things slow and run early on if things look sketchy. After that I would go for Death Channel or Simulacrum. Simulacrum is very powerful with the request corpses ability! It's also worthwhile to note that when playing a necromancer it's a viable option to start with a different caster background for more utility spells and to follow Kiku since you'll get all the necromancy books gifted to you! I find that Ice Elementalists work well this way. (Also makes Simulacrum even more appealing) If you can get rPois Olgrebs Toxic Radiance will be fantastic since it has no effect on your thralls. Simulacrum will take a much larger skill investment than Death Channel since it draws power from Necromancy and Ice magic equally. I would wait until you had some extra xp to burn before I'd get it online unless you had another reason to be training Ice magic in the first place. Ozocobus armour is very powerful if you can find a book of frost and Condensation Shield will be great since you can wear a shield with your glaive."

Also wondering about the Necromicon - Kiku has offered it to me."
dcss,3040se,TungstenYUNOMELT,3,Wed Mar 25 00:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'd do the lair right now, don't go further into the dungeon. Lair is very easy for necromancers due to the pack animals. Raising or receiving a hydra corpse makes for an extremely powerful ally. If you recieved Bolt of Draining, I'd learn that and train conjurations/necromancy to get it online. It's an extremely powerful spell for most of the default game. If kiku was a jerk and didn't give it to you, train polearms up to about 14. You'll want to train up polearms to level 14 just about no matter what, but I'd get bolt of draining online first. Don't bother getting min delay just yet, that'll take polearms skill of 20 and it's just not worth the XP at this stage in the game. Be careful of hydras, they will shred your zombies (and you!) to pieces. Bolt of draining/wands of draining are very good for killing Hydras. After clearing out the lair, clear the orcish mines. Look for Death Channel, Bolt of draining (if you don't have it now), and support spells like Ozo armor/condensation shield.  To continue on what /u/SirKrieger said Ice magic is a very good support school of magic. Ozo armour and cond shield are excellent spells that will be useful throughout the whole game. Simulacrum is extremely powerful later on. It takes a bit too much magic for the early game (only thing really worth it is hydras, but that's only in the lair and swamp. Maybe for Vault:5 to help finish up), but it's very powerful in the depths and Zot because you're likely to get giant corpses/golden dragon corpses from Kiku. Also if you do extended simulacrum is absolutely insane since you're almost guaranteed to recieve multiple titan corpses in Pandemonium and the hells. Also specteral weapon is very strong for your build. Being able to hide behind zombies will make your glaive and your specteral glaive very powerful. Just don't use specteral weapon against enemies with area of effect attacks, as you will take half the damage your specteral weapon recieves.  Death Channel is excellent for the Vaults, since there is a large concentration of weak enemies with high damage output (ogres make excellent specters) and it helps a ton to clear Vault:5, since once you get the ball rolling, there is very little in Vault:5 that will hit you through a horde of specters."

Not that you won't be able to cast Firestorm (you will) but it should not be your focus right now  Focus on defense now. Train dodging, fighting and put points in Dex (you already have enough int to be able to cast Firestorm through skill training without Vehumet).  Consider wearing Mottled Dragon Armour to be less squishy. Get Repel/Deflect Missiles. You can also benefit from a bit more stealth. Pick up a weapon, maybe a staff of fire or some maces/flails - something you can kill trash with to recover and save mana.  Basically, diversify, adapt, be less of a one trick pony.  You should aim to get somewhere between 15 and 20 AC and a good amount of EV (30 or higher)."
dcss,300bih,pereza0,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:55:37 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. This was really helpful. Ive never really understood how to navigate the whole armour situation with DECj. I just found a swamp dragon hide. Would that work?
dcss,300bih,pereza0,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:48:31 2015 UTC,Put it on and see how it affects your spellcasting. The hide and the armour you get from it are equally encumbering. It is a good idea to use armour with encumbrance rating equal or lower to your strength for casting
dcss,300bih,WinterShine,5,Wed Mar 25 00:39:04 2015 UTC,"I have a couple good supporting spells and OoD but Vehemut screwed me out of Firestorm (as always).   If you're trying to get level 9 spells like Firestorm this early, there's a good chance that's why you're getting killed. Your dodging and fighting are okay for just finishing Orc, but if you were to start training for a level 9 now, it would take long enough that your defences would be way too far behind by the time you had it online.  If your goal is just to win the game (and not specifically to win with Firestorm or what have you), then not taking Firestorm at all is probably the safer approach. It's better for 15-rune games when you have loads of extra XP to toss about, and when the extra damage and resistance-penetration matters more.  Pick up Bolt of Fire if you can (it'll play a bit nicer with haste than OOD will). You probably want to start training more Dodging (20 EV was okay up to this point, but you'll want more) and Fighting (two-digit HP is dangerous, things can hit you for 40+ pretty soon).   Then you might want to consider picking up a good low-skill melee weapon (ctrl-f for things like lajatang, demon whip, etc. -- stuff that is strong, but also doesn't require a lot of skill levels to use effectively) so you can (a) kill things if you're low on mana, or (b) kill weak things without wasting mana on them.  Also ctrl-f for nice low-level charms and necro spells like animate skeleton, regeneration, animate dead, sublimation of blood, swiftness, and repel missiles.  Maybe put future stat points in Dex (your magic is already powerful enough for Zot, but your defences will need work). Also, identify one of those teleport wands. You really don't want to find out it's empty in a crucial situation."
dcss,300bih,pereza0,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"He has around 30 Int, and he is a Deep Elf. He will probably be able to get it castable eventually. Its just not the focus ATM"
dcss,300bih,WinterShine,2,Mon Mar 23 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"Able to, sure, very late. But for a new player, it's probably safer to ignore it. It still comes at a cost of other skills, and having a grasp of when one can afford to spend the time training it can be difficult."
dcss,300bih,pereza0,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"Its not that hard really. When you see your secondary skills are beginning to catch up with your main ones its easy to see that you can afford to get the higher level stuff.  Vehumet makes it really easy to get stuff castable, dude has 29 int (and it will go higher) and has OoD castable with 13.3 Conjuration skill and no enhancing equipment.  13.3 skill is less than it takes to get a cutlass (or falchions, hand axes, or maces) to mindelay for reference. Having invested so much in Int and worshipping Vehumet (Firestorm could easily be worth the casting cost as a very damaging multitarget spell) I would go as far as saying not going for Firestorm eventually is quite a bad idea given how little it is going to cost you skill-wise. Still, defnses are a priority right now and not getting Firestorm from Vehumet might be a blessing in disguise for OP  I also don't think there is any new player that won't want to try out the biggest baddest spell"

I usually play GrWz and it usually requires 20+ in both spellcasting and conjuration and 15+ in the elemental magic before the spell failure rate on glaciate/firestorm drops to a point where I want it.   Now granted, I'm a big proponent of going for firestorm/glaciate (the best defense is a good offense, and things can't deal damage to you if they're dead for the most part), but I also have the benefit of the gargoyle's free AC, and plethora of other resistances to help me stay alive until then, and even then I like to invest ~10 points in fighting, armor, and sometimes dodge before going for the big level 9 spells."
dcss,300bih,pereza0,2,Tue Mar 24 08:52:27 2015 UTC,"I wanted to add.  Spellcasting you want to train for MP and spell slots, and to deal with extreme spell hunger (high spell hunger is managable, if you are not starving mid-fight after a few casts, forcing you to eat, you are doing fine. Chunks are everywhere and permafood is plentiful, don't worry about eating it unless you are going extended (and even then don't worry)).  It should usually not be as high as your main skills (conj/fire), it is not as important as those."
dcss,300bih,Disnof,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"You should rarely be casting a highlevel spell like firestorm in the lair branches (besides slime). It shouldn't be until mid way through vault that you start casting it.  You definitely need more AC and either repel or deflect missile. If you don't have these spells yet, try to get a cloud spell and go to elf. (Cloud spells make elf easy as you can kite them into the clouds) Following Vehument you often find yourself without support spells before the lair branches, luckily elf often has many books. Be warned though, with your hp you could easily be 1 or 2 shot by iron shot or crystal spear from annihilators."

You have a lot of Tlocs trained for just blink. Passage of Golubria and Control Teleport should be immediately castable and useful for any character. Phase shift is a solid EV boost and with all that extended experience imminent, I'd try to go for cBlink if available.

The heavy meele hitters in Spider are wolf spiders and emperor scorpions; take care with those around. Nasty surprise for spellcasters without see invisibile are ghost moths, mostly on SPider:5, sometimes even before; will drain mana and have hefty poison. Heavy hitter in ranged attack are the famed orb spider, letting loose orbs of destruction; dont catch more than one to the face or you are dead. Blinking out of the way can help, but is not guaranted.    As for training, well... Bolt of magma should do in a pinch, but hopefully Veh will grant you same AoE damage soon!

To be fair, the war axe seems sufficient if you play Zot carefully enough, but a bigger axe would have been better, foregoing shields. As a Gr you already have a ton of AC, anyway, so having SH isn't quintessential, and executioner's ones are by far the best axes.  Choice depends on divinity too, btw. Ash allows for easier switches, Oka/Trog give you a better chance of finding a high end weapon (almost a given with Trog), TSO can brand a weapon...  How did you die?

(Seriously, other races don't like them early but my god they nearly one shot you...) and in my current run (Just got the Vaults rune, I'm not entirely sure how 3 Rune victories work, and if picking up more runes = harder monsters, but I could quite comfortably get the Abyss Rune) I wouldn't even have a good weapon if it weren't for Trog (Decided to try Long blades since I never use them, as per usual I've found Demon tridants, whips, +15 artifact Bows, staffs, everything But any decent long sword up until recently....)  That being said, Trog is a nice starter god and can help make a lot of runs happen, but I can see why people would want to drop him sooner or later, right now the Regen and MR++ are the only real benefits as my weapons pretty much the best I'm gonna get (+9 Triple sword of freezing), but thanks for suggesting it again."

dcss,2zq910,sanddemon42,2,Fri Mar 20 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"I like how you switched away from Chei and to a naga. :P  Anyway, if you can get this far into a game with any sort of consistency, then you're probably well on your way to winning a game. It's probably not strategy any more that's the barrier, it's just tactical and cautious play that will keep you alive.  I notice you weren't flying. With your +Fly ring on and 10 evo, you probably just want to be flying constantly in Swamp. It makes it much easier to move around or retreat.  Probably the biggest thing is that you didn't really have to be in Swamp:5. The rune floors are always significantly more dangerous than the others, and it because of that it might have been better to stop at Swamp:4 and then head over and do Spider:1-4. At that point you have to get a rune, and you can go for whichever turns out to be easier.  Invisibility may have helped out here too. Hydras can't see invis, which gives you a much lower chance of being hit while waiting on the teleport.  I also notice no zombies around in your death screen. I can't tell if this is because you hadn't created any, or if they just got killed during the fight, but I'd say a Kiku worshipper with animate dead should pretty much always have an army around anywhere dangerous like Swamp:5. They help your offence both directly (they hit things) and indirectly (they distract things, giving you a small ""distraction stab"" bonus), and their presence sometimes makes it easier to retreat.  Also, I noticed you cleared to D:15 before hitting up Lair and Orc. Normally Lair is safer than late D, and you want to do it when you find it (or very shortly after). Orc right after Lair. If you're trying to go right through D skipping Lair often, that might be making your games more difficult.  Last thought on this morgue, the trident is a bit weak for that far into the game. It's possible you just had bad luck, but ideally you'd hope to have something better by this point. Protection is a pretty poor brand for melee characters too, where offence trumps defence. This goes double when you're spending time hitting things from behind a wall of reanimated flesh.  Anyway, your strategy seems sound, so I'd say the barrier between you and a victory here is probably developing a sufficient level of fear for the dungeon lol. Probably the single most important skill to develop in Crawl is recognizing a dangerous situation before it actually becomes dangerous. Erring on the side of caution -- retreating from things you could probably win against -- is typically a much better error to make than the opposite. Playing slow helps too. Whenever a situation might be dangerous, give yourself 20-30 seconds between turns, thinking of what the best move is before acting.  Best of luck, hopefully we'll be seeing a YAVP soon!"

I just had polearm to 14 so I could hit from behind mobs. Necros don't really cast too much in combat though from what I saw.   I don't think you can be a primary caster using only Necro, and it's probably a mistake to think about characters as being ""a caster"" fullstop. Necromancy alone just doesn't have the killing power to be your main offensive capability (until Haunt maybe). You could do a conjurations background (Cj, FE, etc.) into necromancy via Kiku (or whatever else), and then be a caster in that sense, but with necromancy alone, I think you need to be an effective melee combatant to capitalize on it.  A conjurer wielding something like that trident would make perfect sense to me (I'd want it mainly for stuff I don't want to waste MP on, and as a ""stat stick"" to give me a bonus that matters when I'm not hitting things in melee), but a necromancer at least wants one good offensive-oriented weapon (whether that be a melee weapon or a good conjuration spell), and of course you can always switch between two weapons as the need arises.  (If you put two weapons on letters a and b in your inventory, the ' key swaps between them. Use = to reassign inventory, spell, and ability letters.)   I did find a +13 great sword of Pain, but it was -Cast.   Man, that is a rough troll. I think if I found that in your shoes, and my training wasn't already in polearms, I'd probably use it despite the -Cast and swap it out when I needed to cast something. (A lot of necromancy stuff is used between fights anyway, so -Cast on a weapon isn't really a big deal.)"

What helps immediately is usually better than what helps eventually. Acquiring wands right now might get you /heal wounds (though I wouldn't count on it). Just hope this doesn't happen to you:    This is a scroll of acquirement! What kind of item would you like to acquire? Something appears at your feet! You are suddenly pulled into a different region of the Abyss!    Use your !heal wounds if you need to. They're not going to be great in a fight, but if you find yourself on low HP after a fight, healing up a bit isn't a terrible idea. I guess thanks to clarity you can't !ambrosia. This seems like a fair trade. You have lots of haste from potions, the wand, and a recharge. Use it if you need to. But remember that for offence, Finesse is stronger than Haste (2x speed instead of 1.5x speed), and they don't stack. But Finesse only affects attack speed, nothing else. Haste is the best hope of running away if you can't tele. Heroism against everything that isn't a total joke. Unless you run into a banished rat or something, stuff in Abyss will be significant enough of kills that you get the piety back, and even in easier fights it'll help reduce the damage you take a bit. Finesse too when you need to, but seriously, heroism against everything.   Seriously, you should be using Heroism a lot more than you are anyway. You've used it once in your entire game, and Finesse never. If you don't use them, then your Oka piety is as useless as Oka's gifts usually are.  Heroism only costs 1-2 piety, and if you're fighting anything but rabble, you'll probably make that back killing things with your heroism. Finesse is 4-6 piety, so warrants a little more careful usage, but is still something to take advantage of. (Double attack speed = double damage output. Very good.) Keep in mind it also boosts your throwing skill, which means spending less turns in melee combat with things you've softened up.  If I had to wager, you're more likely to be killed trying to survive Okawaru's wrath without the ability to teleport then you are to be killed by the Abyss without the ability to teleport. Both are kinda bad. If you swapped to Lugonu and swapped to a different suit of armour, it'd still be pretty bad, but maybe not quite as much. I'd probably go with looking for an exit. XL 16 is enough to handle Abyss, and it'd be a super easy call if you weren't in Maxwell's."

I hadn't considered wands yet, but that sounds like a great idea!   Use your !heal wounds if you ...   Before the abyss, I could tab through a lot of fights without dipping below 80% health and I mostly healed by waiting if no enemy was in sight. I try to save potions for low health in fights, since I have no wand of heal wounds yet, they really helped me out there.   Heroism against everything that isn't a total ...   ...

As for heroism, you almost want to think of it like a passive that you have to keep pushing a button for.   In fact, characters using high skill requirement weapons like exec axes (26) or unarmed combat (27) are often well-advised to train 5 levels less than their mindelay, and let heroism make up the difference. It saves a lot of skill points (those top few levels are expensive), and in any fight where the difference would matter you'd have heroism on anyway.  The amount of skill you save training, say, UC to 22 instead of 27 is roughly enough to take an equal aptitude skill from 0 to 19. That's a pretty big deal. For similar reasons an Oka worshipper shouldn't train Armour or Dodging past 22. (Fighting is arguably different, since bonus Fighting from Heroism doesn't affect your max HP.)"
dcss,2znipi,Xelif,4,Fri Mar 20 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"My Abyss melee fighting strategy:   Starcursed masses are fucking annoying. They multiply and shriek you to death; the more of them on your screen, the more damage their shrieks do, and if there's 5 or more they can paralyze you (which is very bad in the Abyss). My first priority in a fight is usually to move into range of the starcursed masses and whack them; when you damage them, they merge and become less dangerous. Wretched stars are also fucking annoying. They inflict temporary malmutations on you. Leave them on the screen for 5 or 10 turns and you will have ALL THE BAD MUTATIONS! These malmutations go away quickly by killing other monsters, but they can be annoying-to-debilitating in the meantime. They're my second priority after the starcursed masses. Raiju packs can be dangerous when given space. Channel them into a corridor and they become free chunks. Lurking horrors are stupidly annoying. If you don't immediately move away, they track you and explode on you, inflicting torment. (Fortunately, as a gargoyle, that's only a quarter of your health, not half of it.) Try to deal with them one-on-one so you can rest and heal up - draw them into an explored area rather than tabbing at them. Apocalypse crabs are as annoying as having IRL crabs. They breathe clouds of chaos on you, which inflict chaos effects on you, which can be everything from healing to hilariously bad mutations. Usually the latter, because Crawl hates you and wants you to die. I usually advance towards them, dealing with the chaos, and kill them ASAP. Thrashing horrors can hit hard, but you can take them one-on-one. Tentacled starspawn are kind of popcorny for a melee character. Avoid obvious vaults. The best way to do this is to never open doors. Move manually; move diagonally. This reveals more tiles. Each tile has an equal chance of being an exit portal, so moving diagonally maximizes your chances of leaving the Abyss soon. Auto-explore is only your friend in Abyss if you're already high level and everything is popcorn and you just want to get the rune and move on to Pandemonium and the Hells.   So, to summarize: kill starcursed masses and wretched stars and apocalypse crabs with great prejudice, retreat and kill raiju, thrashing horrors, and lurking horrors, tab tentacled starspawn, and use your judgment with all others - everything from a single rat to an ancient lich can spawn in the Abyss."

dcss,2znipi,felloutthevault,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:43:59 2015 UTC,You'll be fine to look for an exit. Abyss 1 isn't that bad. Just play cautious. It's too late to prepare for the abyss and you aren't rune hunting so advice here won't be too beneficial. I'll type up more tomorrow when I'm at a computer if you want to get the rune later in your game.
dcss,2znlsp,theraydog,8,Fri Mar 20 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"Stealth can be handy later on in the game -- some people argue anyone not in heavy armour should have some, though I think that's probably too far. One nice thing about stealth on a necro is the distraction stabs you can get. This is a pretty big deal if you're using short blades, but still kind of nice if you're not. But either way, it's not enough of a big deal to train Stealth up early if you're not actively using it to attempt stabs (since distraction stabs are the weakest stabs in terms of damage).  For the record, a ""distraction stab"" is when you attack something which is distracted by some other attacker (usually one of your summons or necromantic minions). In tiles the enemy will be marked with a '?' just like they would if they were confused. See here for some details on numbers. Since stabbing bonus is based on the average of your weapon skill and stealth skill, having a bit of stealth later on in the game (when you can warrant sinking XP away from your primary offence and defence skills) isn't a terrible idea for summoners, necros and so forth who have a lot of minions.  To more directly answer your questions, no, having Stealth skill will not make it more likely for an enemy to attack your minions rather than you. It only has the usual effect, that the enemy might not notice you in the first place, but once it does, its choice of who to attack won't be based on Stealth. Minions walking about won't blow your cover (as Stiegurt mentions), but they still make noise fighting.  If you're interested in more detailed help, you can post a morgue file. Just press # in game and you'll see in the message log where the file saved. Copy and paste that into a pastebin (or your preferred alternative) and pop the link in here, and someone may be able to give you advice more specific to your character."

So thing number one,  your undead allies don't cause any noise just walking around,  so stealth isn't useless in that sense,  but it may not be especially helpful,  particularly early on,  where every point of xp is very important.  If you are killing things with a short blade,  stealth will let you sneak up on things and stab them,  but it will also let you get a surprise attack when a critter takes a turn to attack one of your undead minions.   If you aren't primarily killing things with a short sword,  stealth doesn't have as much early game benefit, and you should concentrate on whatever you do use to kill stuff"

dcss,2znlsp,steakmm,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:13:08 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong but kill dudes is still more important. I would also argue that for a necromancer you're going to have trouble with being stealthy due to your minions, so stealth is mostly only useful when you're in that portion of the level when you have no minions (first entrance to the level, or perhaps after facing a particularly tough enemy)."
dcss,2znlsp,triorph,0,Fri Mar 20 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is that, practically speaking:   The characters that need to be able to pick their battles (and so could use a little Stealth early) are the ones who need their XP for their primary skills the most - non-blaster casters (Enchanter, Skald, Warper, Ice Elementalist, some Earth Elementalists and Air Elementalists). Melee can just quaff those spare potions of might and agility and kill them; blasters can position and kill them. You shouldn't build your character around the assumption that you'll run into 3 red uniques chilling in a powerful area at once. It's an incredibly rare situation."
dcss,2zmkia,SquidThistle,6,Thu Mar 19 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"My secret strategy is to just never do it. I hate vaults:5 and you only need 3 runes to win the game. Slime or Abyss are both preferable, although you probably want rMut for both.  One strategy some people like: If you have rF+++ (or even just rF++) you can use a scroll of immolation on going down the stairs, then when you fight stuff it goes and blasts its neighbours up and greatly helps you. I tried it last time I did it and it was okay, but that game I was even more lucky in just having no vault wardens by the stairs, making stairdancing a valid opportunity."
dcss,2zmkia,triorph,5,Thu Mar 19 21:31:11 2015 UTC,Clear depths before hand for sure.   I like to read a teleport before even going down the stairs and just risk whatever I end up. If you are a quiet character chances are you can kill what's around before the whole level hears.
dcss,2zmkia,nospamkhanman,3,Thu Mar 19 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"First, yes, you should definitely save V:5 for after Depths.  If you have access to cTele (even a ring with zero evo skill):   Evoke or cast your cTele, Read teleport, Go down the staircase to V:5, Read mapping, When the tele goes off, pick a spot in one of the eight narrow outer hallways, halfway between a corner of the map and the midpoint of one side of the map.   This way there should be few enemies around you and you can clear a little safe area to do your fighting in. I start by going to a corner and pulling enemies back into my safe zone from there.  If you have rCorr, rMut, and rC:  Consider doing Slime instead. If you can kill the royal jelly, this is sometimes a safer strategy than ever seeing foot in V:5. Piercing attacks (like bolt spells) are extra good here.  Otherwise:  You could consider Abyss if you really think you can't handle Vaults. Note that it tends to be nastier in different ways. Resting in Abyss is hard, so regen is really good. (Ambrosia is quite handy here for lower HP races.)  If you do go Vaults, generally you want to get out of the horde at the middle and retreat down a hallway where you can fight fewer at a time. (If you're lucky and no wardens are in view, you can also stair dance.) Random teleport may also be an option. Teleport early if you're going to need to; you don't want to random tele on unexplored V:5 with low health. Burn potions/wand charges if you need. Don't forget god abilities; if there are any places in the game to burn piety, it's V:5 and Z:5."
dcss,2zmkia,WinterShine,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"You could consider Abyss if you really think you can't handle Vaults.   Yeep! Abyss isn't difficult, but it requires a mature character to get the rune, unless you get very lucky. At the level you'd be at when you clear Vault:4, large abominations and whatnot are still not popcorn; things will survive your attacks and hit you hard. That gives more time for wretched stars to load you up with bad temporary mutations, neqoxecs to malmutate you, starcursed masses to multiply, worldbinders to summon annoying popcorn to block you from killing the above, and the inevitable ancient lich that shows up when you're at 50% HP and you just need one or maybe two more hits to clear the mob...  If you're going to do Abyss before Vault:5, you really need good MR and the ability to put on rMut and SustAb without gimping yourself (by that point I often find that I'm depending on jewellery for various aspects of my character, and don't particularly want to take off a ring that will help me killdudes or notdie to put on a ring of sustain abilities; I'm a big fan of faith for most characters I run, so amulets of resist corrosion are kinda taboo for me...)"
dcss,2zmkia,Xelif,2,Fri Mar 20 07:55:32 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with Vault:5 personally.  Use everything:   Ensure you've buffed everything you can buff. Potions of might and agility, brilliance for any casters, RMsl/DMsl, haste, Phase Shift, Song of Slaying, Ozo's Armour, Stoneskin, etc. Think about every move; do not use the tab key.  Use your resources once you're there. Immediately start using those resources you've ""saved"" - wands, evocables, etc. You have a couple of turns before the vault guard popcorn starts swarming you - use them! Use those wands of fireball. A phial of floods with even minimal (~10) Evocations skill will cover your vicinity with shallow water, slowing and debuffing your opponents. A lamp of fire on top of that will damage enemies and create steam, blocking LOS. If you've actually invested into Evocations, this is an easy challenge; put on some rElec item and spam the ever-living fuck out of a disc of storms. Hit the stragglers that don't die. (Note: IMHO, and this may be unpopular, but an early disc of storms + rElec should change your tactics. Disc of storms is ridiculously overpowered with decent Evocations skill, and downright devastating if you train it up to 15-20.)   If you're dying to Vault:5 with a berserker, you've done something wrong; it should be a challenging, but not deadly, fight. Do you have a morgue file for your last (GrBe) game? You may be skilling incorrectly.  When you hit Vaults:5 depends on the character and what the dungeon has given you. You really need to do it a couple of times before you get a feel for when you can handle it, and when you need to clear Depths or dip into Slime first. (Abyss before V5 sounds like a bad idea to me, but YMMV.)  If all else fails, you can always read a scroll of teleportation immediately before going down the stairs. The rest of the level is amenable to corridor tactics. You probably won't teleport into anything deadly... and if you do, your first move is to read another !tele."

I usually descend, then quickly ascend, and wipe out whoever came up with me. Then I find a different down staircase and repeat. A major drawback can be if a vault warden closes off the stairs, though, in which case I charge him and destroy him. I then try to clear out the outside rectangle before going into each quadrant. At the slightest threat I go upstairs for a breather.   rElec and rN are pretty essential for titans and shadow dragons.   Interesting strategies I'm seeing from others though, never thought of the scroll of immolation trick."

The resulting fire takes out the horde and most things that come at you from the corners. The rest of the level is pretty easy IMHO, once you can get through the initial onslaught, you're set if you can go up against ancient liches and dragons. I'd recommend at least rF++, 30 AC and 100 spare HP to safely attempt this, which you should have by the time you get to vaults. If you can avoid getting caught in the explosion (haste+ranged/spells), even better - you need to kill only one or two of them to set off a chain reaction."

Seriously, the last 10 runes are balanced around you not taking (almost any) damage from regular sources, so they have torment and hellfire that there's no way to resist. At any point in extended, you can walk into view of a couple of fiends, get tormented on subsequent turns, and then be down to like, a quarter of your HP in like 20aum.  Ok, so actual advice: given that you are always a few turns away from (hypothetical) death, you want to ditch that -Tele like it's hot. If it was a ring, that'd be one thing, but on armor that you can't get rid of, drop it.  Sucks that there's no better cloak, but looks like the only other one I see is -TELE as well. I think (-20, 41, Vaults:5) a pair of runed gloves might be better gloves than archery... I suppose youre softening things up with throwing first, which is nice. Nice jewelry.  For weapon: you have hella enchant weapon. you can either enchant up that antimagic triplesword, or if you switch gods, go TSO first, bless the mundane one and then enchant it up to +9, then spend the rest on the other one for a swap against spellcasters as needed. Or, if you take shields, the demon blade of venom.  Figuring out what that shield is is probably worthwhile... A lot of people will tell you just to optimize your damage output, but TBH I like to do 1h + shields when I can. If you can get a big enough weapon (+9 demon blade counts) it can be good. That being said, the shield in your gear is the only (possibly) worthwhile one, so barring it being good, i'd stick with 2h.  For switching gods... I dunno. Trogs wrath is nasty as I understand. You're only XL 23. But you do have pretty good AC right now. I'd do it if you're overly confident you can survive, and you promise to be careful :)"

He wound up being very melee oriented in the extended game, but it was a super fun hybrid build and I basically switched to melee oriented because Blessed Blade and cleansing flame.  If you're on .16 apparently gargoyles can't cast statue form, but that shouldn't be too big of an issue especially if you aren't going to do extended because they're still a super powerful race."

Would you say it would be a good way to get my feet wet in the extended game? I've only won three times, and they were all 3-5 runers (slime and tomb). I've never stepped foot in hell or a ziggurat before..  If you did it over again, would you still choose Ash? I've never gone with Ash before."
dcss,2zk0bz,Bobthemightyone,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think I'd pick Ash again. Ash is super good for hybrids since you can easily get various skills boosted up. It's makes it so much easier to get spells online and at max/near max power while you work on your defensive and weapon skills. Also scrying and knowing where enemies are is really powerful with LRD since you can use LRD to blast enemies from around corners. It didn't come up in the run I had, but being able to transfer skills would also make it less of an investment if you wanted to switch weapon types if you found something good.  Gargoyles are awesome for extended game because they have so many good resistances. They're immune to rot and resistant to torment so they're excellent for Pan/Tomb/Hell, they have an insane AC boost of +20AC at max level so their AC is always good regardless of whatever class of armor you find, and their ability to fly indefinitely at level 13/14 is more useful than you'd think it'd be. The only thing you really have to fear in extended game are sources of hellfire (hellfire ignores all resistances), since Gargoyles have low base health.   Gargoyles are probably one of the easiest races to play since they have good resistances for both early and late game, so I'd use them as a first 15 runer race. If you lose a run with 3+ runes it's not that bad since it's fairly easy to get a gargoyle to that point again. It makes it a lot less frustrating when you die with 9 runes when you can just play again and probably get to around the same point."
dcss,2zk0bz,Bobthemightyone,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:46:07 2015 UTC,How do you play the early game? I'm conflicted over whether to make melee or earth magic my main killing skill to start.
dcss,2zk0bz,lobf,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"Earth magic for sure. Sandblast is competent enough to kill single dudes, Stone Arrow is good but won't become great until you start training conjurations, and once you get LRD online you'll be able to blast away groups of enemies like orcs and killer bees. Melee comes much later. Looking back through my dump, I didn't train a melee skill until Lair 2. I trained fighting some for the health so I wouldn't get 2 or 3 shotted by priests, but it was all magic related skills and dodging until then. I like to train spellcasting first so I can get a few extra points of magic, then  Orc priests are your worst fear until you get LRD online. They will easily two shot you on D:3-D:4 if you're not very careful of them. Once LRD is online they're trivial as you can simply blast them from a distance. Jackals are much more of a threat for magic users on the D:1-D:2 since it's difficult to kite them away from the herd and magic users are limited in magic early game.  edit: Melee mostly becomes useful once Ash starts supporting your skills. Once you have a cursed weapon, even just putting 3 or 4 levels into it will be supported up to a reasonable amount. Until then it's more important to get your evasion and earth magic to a reasonable amount."

Keep in mind that Wr is basically a pure melee start that happens to have a tloc book on hand. You should treat it as melee. That means (a) Don't go short blades, they're terrible damage unless you're stabbing; (2) Train your weapon first, not your defences. Every character should start off training how to kill dudes, and only train defences after their offence is sufficient; and, (3) Despite starting with the book, translocations is defence at best, and tertiary/extra stuff at worst, so you don't really want to train more than a small amount of it early.   and I'm trying to go Cheibriados. My general goal is to go ranged, get crossbows up there while I keep up things like Distortion/Singularity/etc and take pop shots....   On the topic of Cheibriados, if you're finding the combo hard, don't pick Chei. Chei will make it even harder. Chei should be considered a challenge god, much like Xom is.  The majority of non-Xom, non-Chei gods probably would fit this background. (Arguably even Trog, you just drop the book and turn into a Berserker, but you're probably not into that if you're trying to play Wr.) Vehumet is right out, and Sif is probably a bad choice too (not as bad as Chei, but Sif won't give you anything useful for a long time). Pretty much any other god could work with this build. I recommend picking one as early as you can -- then when you hit that D:8-10 range you'll already have a lot of piety and, therefore, abilities to get yourself out of those dangerous situations.  On the topic of planning and goals, Crawl will punish you for trying to plan your build before you've even seen what's in the dungeon. The best long-term strategy in DCSS is typically to do whatever's right in the short-term. First, focus on your offence, which will almost certainly be some melee weapon. Once you can safely kill dudes with it, get some defence. Then if your offence needs catching up work on that. Invo is special -- always train enough to use all the abilities your god is offering. After your offence, defence and invo are good enough, and you've got some XP to spare, then you can afford to put some skill points into extra stuff like ranged weapons, translocations magic, and so forth.  Generally, unless you're with Trog or Vehumet (and even sometimes with Vehumet), don't go into Crawl with a detailed build planned out. Instead, prepare to adapt to what's on the floor. If your offence and defence are okay, you're about to hit Lair, and a really great bow drops, great, you can train for that. Or if you find a rod or two, maybe evo's better. Or if neither of those, more melee offence and more defence never hurt anyone.  Last thought, Warper is a challenging background. Despite how good translocations are (or at least how powerful they can feel), this background is harder to get off the ground than plain old Fighter or Gladiator are. It's also harder than offensive magic starts like Conjurer or, say, Fire Elementalist."
dcss,2zkcxv,WinterShine,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:44:36 2015 UTC,Well here's an update: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=8JZxeu6X I tried out a halfling... I had a pretty amazing start (artifact armor plus a nice enchanted long sword)... I got cornered on a stair with a red ugly thing. I died in two hits :( 30+ damage both time. Notice anything I did wrong in general? I went 14 long blade first
dcss,2zkcxv,WinterShine,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say the main reason you died there was because you tried to fight a red ugly thing on D:8, and never tried to run. That's a very strong enemy pre-lair (honestly, it's a strong enemy post-lair and post-orc) and you probably should have just retreated. You definitely should have retreated when the fight went south. Reading tele at the very least. Of course, I see you went with Chei again, so walking away (the most powerful move in Crawl) was lost to you. If you were with any other god, you'd be much more likely to survive out-of-depth encounters like that. (I'm not sure individual ugly things are even out-of-depth on D:8 any more, there was some change to them recently, and they spawn solo at higher floors than they used to.)  I see you ate mutagenic meat too. I'd advise against doing that. Bad mutations are often worse than good mutations are beneficial. Teleportitis, berserkitis, shouting, blurry vision... all really bad to have. Your blurry vision might have got you killed even if you had tried to tele.  Your skilling was fine. I'd say get either dodging or armour (depending on your gear and race) before getting fighting, but you weren't at a point where that would have made a difference yet.  If you really want to play Chei, far be out from me to stop you; what's fun is fun. But if you worship Chei, you should be expecting to end up stuck in deadly situations that under any other god you could easily walk away from. Chei disables some of the best tactics in Crawl, even just stepping back to safe territory before engaging enemies. And in this morgue, it looks like you used one of its invocations once. Hardly makes up for it."
dcss,2zkcxv,Forty__Three,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"You probably trained a little bit too much long blades. at around 10 Long blades or so, you should've started training some dodging/fighting. Also, You didn't try to escape! That's the biggest reason to start as a warper. Why didn't you use blink? You also have the dispersal tomahawks which you can use to keep the ugly thing away.   Ugly things hit like a truck when you first meet them, and as early as level 8, you really need to be careful about them, doubly so if you don't have any resistance to the color they are (fire in this case).  practice running away earlier if things aren't going well. Especially if getting away can be done with spells, which means that you're losing absolutely nothing by escaping."
dcss,2zkcxv,duckroller,2,Thu Mar 19 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"The general skilling order for crawl characters regardless of class is something like this: killdudes skill until you're killing stuff easily, then defensive skills until you're not threatened, then back to offensive skills, and by ~L:1 you can usually afford to train a few skills at once.  Blink is really nice to have online early, but imo the rest of your starting book can wait until around lair. Shroud is nice, but the experience needed to get it online would keep you much safer invested in offense at the very beginning.  Starting with short blades means it might be good to pick up a few levels of stealth early on, to help pick and choose your fights and get the occasional stab in. When you see a sleeping enemy that might be too strong or typically travels in packs that you can't handle at the edge of your line of sight, don't risk waking them up. Immediately head the opposite direction and set an exclusion on them (especially if you're using autoexplore). Crawl's not about killing every monster you see, it's about surviving until  you can win.   If you find you're getting caught out in open areas, practice pulling enemies one by one into narrow hallways in already explored areas, and pull groups around corners in said hallways to keep ranged threats from shooting/smiting you. The noise from fighting draws nearby baddies, of which there are far fewer in previously cleared areas, and fighting enemies from one direction instead of 8 cuts down the damage you receive dramatically. This seems more difficult with chei, but I don't have much chei experience so if you're dead set on taking it easy this strategy might be suicidal."
dcss,2zkcxv,conflare,2,Thu Mar 19 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"I've played exactly one warper, and am also not very good at crawl. I just had a strange and successful run that epitomizes the advice of /u/WinterShine to adapt to what's on the floor, and maybe an example of when Chei doesn't suck for warpers.  I started a HuFi, found Chei on the second floor and figured what the hell, never played with Chei before. Chei is ridiculously awesome, especially (I think) for hybrid characters. +15 to all stats at max piety, and with such an early start on it, getting there was fast. Slouch was good for taking out smiting monsters that were hard to get to otherwise. (Most of those seem fairly weak - orc priests became a non-threat, and I laughed off bogarts in Vault). It took forever for me to get sInv, so it was also useful for that.  I found a book of Translocations shortly after Chei. Blink of course. Portal Projectile with javelins once Slouch wasn't doing enough to get at blocked monsters. Passage of Golubria saved my ass more than once. I used this to compensate somewhat for being so slow.  A second piece of ridiculous luck - a scroll of acquirement on D7 that gave me a vampiric demon whip. Used temporal distortion to pull ranged or jumpy monsters close so I could have my way with them.  I basically used that and some good FDA to get three runes and out. I was working towards Singularity, but didn't make it before deciding to snatch the orb and run. I would have gone extended, but the FDA was the last good thing I found. Nothing with rN and the whip was starting to be less effective with nothing to upgrade to.  This was my easiest game ever. Lucky weapon and armour helped a lot, but in this very specific instance, Chei was my copilot."
dcss,2zkcxv,DinoTsar415,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to preface by saying I'm not very good at this game.   I've played a Halfling Warper way too many times to count, and I too like to go with Chei as a god, and I too have had mixed results. The deepest I've ever gotten with one is Depth's 3 or 4, but I've also had plenty die on D1-3. I'm not sure how well my advice for warpers will carry over from halfings to elves, but I'll give it a shot:  First thing first, warpers are always going to have a hard time early game. I've had more warpers die in D1-D10 than anywhere else, but once you jump this initial hurdle you're utility begins to contribute a lot more to your survivability. Question is, how do you get past this initial lack of power? I don't know if I could really say that there's a perfect way to do this, but I'll give some tips:   If there are enemies visible, save for the smallest and loneliest ones, have your shroud up. The second it goes down in any measurable fight, put it back up. It has saved my life so often. Use your consumables somewhat freely during this time, even more so than with other characters.  Honestly there's a pretty heavy degree of luck to warpers, especially ranged based ones (which I prefer). You just have to hope for some kind of enchanted ranged weapon if you aren't going to pray to a god who'll give you ammo and weapons.  Teleport Other is a fantastic tool when you've got one big guy and lots of little ones. Make it so you can 1v1 the hard monsters in open spaces by bouncing them away and leaving them for last. Use Cheibriados' Slouch ability often. The piety loss is hardly noticeable when you use it to kill a few fast monsters and even if you drop a pip, you'll get it back soon enough."
dcss,2zkcxv,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Thu Mar 19 10:34:35 2015 UTC,"Well, rule no1 is dont choose Chei. The other is, take a long blade, really, scimitars are good and not at all rare (erica has one, wights get some, orc warriors), and you definitly will feel the extra damage.  Third on the list is, I only bother with blink (which is amazing) and ignore the other stuff until later (maybe if I really want a char to work shroud of G). High elfs are strong in melee, and book is just an extra."
dcss,2zkcxv,advil00,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:18:36 2015 UTC,"I've won a HEWr  (and played a lot of them while trying to do that; this was part of a challenge so the people in my crawl group were talking it over) and I would just straight up say that this combo sucks.  If you want a hybrid with an early game that involves blink, consider HEWz.  If you want a late game with translocations, do something like HEWz and train translocations (and hope for the right books).  That said, if you insist, I would go long blades and bows (not xbows); the moment you find a bow train only that for a while.  I would recommend practically anything other than chei, but try okawaru, or maybe ash.  Also, you'll need to retreat all the time -- don't fight ghosts except on the stairs (if at all), and don't fight in the open."
dcss,2zkcxv,marsharpe,0,Fri Mar 20 00:16:26 2015 UTC,"I would consider choosing another god personally, because high elf is frail I would begin with worshipping oka until you have some nice gear and enchanted ammo, and then swap to something else. Since you have warp there isnt too much danger of getting surrounded by an okawaru ganksquad. If you go the oka route I would consider skipping short blades altogether and beginning with a long blade. For skilling I would get warp castable then pump long blades to 14 and fighting to 10 or so. Training up 5 shields for a buckler could do alot for your survivability. I would focus more on melee during the early game and train up ranged attacks later. Train dodging after you can reliably kill things as often the best defense is just killing your opponent before they can hurt you. Spam the crap out of shroud and teleport other is an excellent way to get rid of something like early OOD monsters and ogres."

Because of the way armour works in DCSS, quick blades, despite having theoretically good DPS, aren't very good against enemies with decent AC unless you've got a flat damage brand (elec, pain, distortion, I guess chaos too).  I've done a 15-runer with a Kiku worshipper with a quickblade of flame for extnded before (basically, similar scenario to you).  It was +9 and I had maybe 10 or so slaying from my gear, and I still found I had trouble killing many enemies in melee and had to rely pretty heavily on my simulacrums and Haunt.  Admittedly, simulacrums are ridiculously amazing in extended, because request corpses pretty consistently gives giants, dragons, and hydras at high necromancy in most extended branches, so even without a good weapon you can solve nearly any problem with request corpses and simulacrum."

dcss,2zh9so,Ztang,6,Wed Mar 18 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say Wand is probably your best odds. You should zap that bronze wand first to identify it (acquirement will usually give you a wand you haven't already seen). In fact, you should identify it anyway, so you can use it if you need/want it. You should also identify that unread scroll (unless you know using \- what it probably is). You have the IDs to spare.  Anyway, I say wand because (a) it is weighted somewhat in favour of healing, haste, and teleport, which are all stellar, and (b) a number of the other wands would still be good for you, even if they're not what you really want, whereas an unlucky draw from armour or weapons would just end up dropped on the ground and forgotten.  Armour might give you an ego hat or robe, but it's hardly guaranteed. And if you get a cloak, it's surely not gonna be better than {Str+2 Slay+5 Stlth+} on a spriggan. Weapon might give you a quick blade if you're interested in that possibility; this is great if you have a brand scroll or two hanging around. Gold is good if there's something in a store you can't afford; it's one of the rare ways that ?acquirement will give you something guaranteed good. (Another is acquiring fruit for Fedhas.)  I find that jewellery is almost never worth acquiring. You might get a useful unbranded one (I'd honestly consider =rF to be a pretty good acquire). If you press \ then - you can see what unidentified jewellery are left, and decide if a random one of those is likely to be any good. Even then you might get a randart, and randart jewellery can be very hit or miss.  By the way, you should really wear that =rC instead of the =Stealth. Going around with rC- is very dangerous. You could easily be one-shot if you were to run into something sufficiently nasty (like Fannar).  Last thought on ?acquirement: They're nicknamed scrolls of disappointment for a reason. There's almost always a fair chance of them giving you rubbish. If you get something bad from one, it doesn't mean you made a wrong choice, you just didn't luck out. Generally just read them right away, acquire whatever you think would be nicest to have, and cross your fingers. The only guarantees I'm aware of are acquiring gold, Fedhas + acquiring food = fruit, and Trog + acquiring staff = random rod."
dcss,2zh9so,WinterShine,3,Wed Mar 18 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'd probably go armour.  Your robe and hat are +2, but there's a definitely took for improvement on either.  When in doubt I usually go armour.  Wands could also be a good option, hoping for heal wounds or hasting.  Also, wear your ring of protection from cold instead of stealth.  Running around with an elemental weakness is very, very dangerous, especially on a low-defense character.  Much worse than having slightly less stealthy.  I would also stop training short blades unless you've got a rapier you're planning to use.  You're at min-delay for your dagger and more training won't give a lot of benefit."

dcss,2zgoik,sadger,2,Wed Mar 18 13:05:28 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I haven't played trunk since 0.16 became release, so I'm not familiar with any changes.  First thing I see, you are still using a morningstar after finishing Orc. Do a Ctrl-F search for ""Maces & Flails"" (without the quotes) and you can see a list of every M&F type weapon in the dungeon. There must surely be something better than that morningstar, whether it means switching to a 2-hander (great mace) or picking up a better 1-hander (demon whip, eveningstar). I see you've already trained shields to 15 (a bit unfortunate) but you don't want to get to endgame with a morningstar regardless. You could even switch to a great mace for now, and to a good dwhip/eveningstar later if you find one. (You've enough AC that lacking the SH doesn't really mean much, and your shield is just vanilla anyway.)  I'd probably also upgrade the armour a bit. rN+ is kind of pointless in a 3-rune game, and you're probably better served in something heavier, since you have 21 STR.  Skills: If you do find a better weapon, train for that if needed. If you want defences, buffing your Dodging and/or Fighting a bit is probably the way to go since your EV and HP are further behind than your AC and your armour doesn't have high base AC to benefit from training. If there are rods available (say in shops -- you can ctrl-F search for those too) even more Evo might be good.   Or, since your defences are in fact pretty solid, you could absolutely go for level 1-3 spells like apport, blink, repel missiles, swiftness, etc. (I think before going for Haste or other high level spells you want to spend a bit more time on Fighting to get your HP up. Haste will take much longer to get online, so you need to be able to ""waste"" that much time into it while your defences go untrained.)"
dcss,2zgoik,WinterShine,2,Wed Mar 18 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"> First thing I see, you are still using a morningstar after finishing Orc  Morningstars are the best common one-handed weapon in the game.  Not finding a demon whip or eveningstar by the end of Orc is quote common - I'd probably say that finding one by then is rarer, actually.  So a morningstar being the best one-handed option after Orc is very reasonable.  That said, you should usually have a great mace by the end of Orc, which is often a better option."
dcss,2zgoik,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're definitely right about them being the best one-handed weapon one is likely to find that early, but I think that switching to great mace is nearly always better at that point (especially with all that AC). Then if you find an eveningstar or dwhip later, you can switch back. I'd personally do this even with shields trained (though I'd probably only have it trained to 5, which would admittedly affect that decision compared to having 15).  In op's case in particular it's a morningstar of venom, so there were decent odds of having a better one-hander in the form of a morningstar with a better brand as well."
dcss,2zgoik,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:45:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for your detailed replies again. If you recall you helped me with my MiBe before I went into spider. Funny thing happened in that game. I decided to do up to dungeon 15 to get a few more scrolls and maybe equip. Ended up being banished to the abyss and dying. Such is the game!  I have got a eveningstar now but it's only a +1 of draining and i've no enchant weapon. Is that a good switch. I have found a few great maces too I  guess I can try those.   The only other armour I have found is +0 plate and also mottled dragon hide. Got a few scrolls of enchant armour too. So maybe a switch is on the cards. I have been putting most of my skill points in DEX is this generally a good idea?
dcss,2zgoik,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"Cheers!  Draining isn't stellar, but it's likely better than venom by this point. You're going to find more and more rPois enemies, and the rN enemies will nearly all be rPois as well. Venom can be great early game, but tapers off. Also, the base damage of the eveningstar trumps a couple of plusses on the morningstar. (Base damage is multiplied by skills, enchantments and slaying aren't.) Rebrand it if you get a scroll.  Dex is fine. The only reason to take str is to wear heavier armour, and you already have enough for plate. So it should all go to dex or int, and int generally only if you plan to cast higher level spells.  Mottled iirc has 6 base AC but better ER than what you've got. You have enough str to not really care about the ER much though. Try on the plate, see if it raises your AC by more than it reduces your EV. If it does, keep it on."

dcss,2zgoik,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"I might've rebranded eveningstar instead of the great mace personally, but I'd take the flaming great mace over the draining eveningstar and shield. I'd bet there are expert players who would encourage rebranding and using the great mace as op did too, considering the AC op already has.  ""Wasting"" the 15 levels in shields feels bad, but do be careful about worrying too much over sunk costs. The real lesson here is probably to not go over 5 in shields (on a medium race) unless and until you're holding a one-hander you can end the game with.  VM are an interesting example. Many (not all) VM end up hardly having use for poison magic at all late game. But it still got them there, making that skill investment valuable. (In Crawl, short term advantage tends to trump long term.)"

dcss,2zgoik,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well, the really good players get away with all kinds of shennanigans. Does not mean that a third level of defense is not better for some people; it is more forgiving to errors."
dcss,2zgoik,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Wed Mar 18 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe. I think the reason that skilled players would recommend going for the bigger weapon is that, in many cases, having a better weapon will result in you taking less damage in a 1v1 with a significant enemy than having better armour will, simply because you kill the thing that was damaging you. Compounded with the fact that SH is the weakest of the three defences (although it was buffed in... 0.15 I think?), this means switching to a 2-hander is usually the best approach, unless you find one of the top-tier 1-handers (which tend to be pretty rare).   All this is further compounded by the fact that, once you start facing enemies with very high AC, small differences in base damage of weapons can equate to larger (percentage-wise) differences in damage dealt to targets that mitigate a lot of damage. (These are just random/arbitrary numbers, but say an enemy mitigates 20 damage per hit on average. Then dealing 30 damage per hit is roughly twice as good as dealing 25 damage per hit versus that enemy, modulo some details about spikes in damage or mitigation.)"
dcss,2zg2n5,DrStalker,2,Wed Mar 18 07:39:10 2015 UTC,"Oi! Zero dodging in lair on a stabber is a death penalty! Any spiny frog, komodo dragon or black mamba will fuck your shit up! Heavily! So heres what I'd suggest you do: turn on only dodging, and do one level more of dungeon. Put the next ID scroll on that wand of hasting; and if you are back in lair, if you see a non-sleeping faster than you enemy, escape immediately! Nothing that cant be fixed in a few levels but you will want to play super cautiously. rat packs, sheep are fine, black mamba(use slowing on them) wolves 1 one 1, yaks 1 on 1 with consumables (well you dont have a lot, so use wand of draining preemptively), no no to komodo dragons or spine frogs (unless slowed /at least half dead).  You might want to consider _not_stabbing hydras, since if one wakes up adjacent to you you are pretty much dead. just put an exclusion around them. Now is the time to use these wands in your inventory for all they are worth- spam slow and draining on these dangerous encounters."

Mahkleb or vampiric dagger are fun as enchanters. I usually put enough into hexes to get invisibility online- that would be around  14, but you have not hit spellpower limit on confuse/enslave at that point- not a thing anymore due to dazzling spray in the starter book now. Dazzling spray is still silly strong, and allows for an easy transition into blasters- train up conjuration, dazzle everything, and blast stuff that just wont stay doen.  What I would often do for enchanters is train short blades to 12 early, so I can melee stuff,(works better if you get venom/draining/elec/pain short blade, a bland sucks even before you enter lair, and venom/draining starts sucking around lair) and spend my first ?acq, (usually in lair) on weapon, often granting  a quickblade.  Enchanters with access to invisibilty -sif muna is a great choice btw for getting all those sweet high level hexes, invisibility, the mass hexes that get 50% spellpower bonus over the single target ones etc- can farm elf, and esp elf:2,hall of blades, for endgame quality weapons.  Allies totally work to kill stuff that woke up; either via evocations/summons/necromancy, but you have to be hardy for that. If that stone giant is not distracted and hits you, you are down to half health with bad defenses.  Needlestabbing, while great in theory, has the unfortunate side effect of also getting all sorts of throwing ammunition, since it shares the same skill. So while you might get more paralyze needles than in normal game, its not enough to paralyze stuff everything, just high value targets.  Evocations, in form of wands of enslavement/confuse/paralyze can work as well if you have good positive apts for it, on spriggan or with ash evo at 12-15 can get you trough lair,down to d:15, and trough orc.

If you are careful enough with Dith and some luck mid game is a joke, anything that can't see invisible is dead and doesn't represent a risk. Just remember to skip packs that can see inv (the snake pit may be a problem, any others?) and use his step ability to kill uniques before they wake up. The real problem comes with the late game (zot etc..) where almost everything will resist your hexes and has Sinv. Also, some enemies can kill you one on one if you don't have the appropriate equipment. For draconians packs I used discord and ran away if I couldn't isolate the others. Concerning Zot 5, cast haste and run. A better option for the late game could be to transition to fulltime caster (as you mentioned, sif muna) but you need a lot of exp for that and I'm not sure it works/is worth for a 3 runer.  Take in account that as you use one big blast spell you are likely to wake up half of the level, making sneaking much harder."

Spider has webs, which if you get caught in, alters nearby spiders to your presence, and demonic crawlers which shriek horribly.  As for Zot: draconians dont see invisible so that easy. Zot has superb terrain for passwall- most useful with ash, but also possible for other chars (dithmenos with shadow step etc)."

Then you want more dodging, if you fight a lot of stuff in melee, esp on a Chei char you get great results from it, 18-20. Then you will cmd+f for ""amulet"" and ""cold"" - maybe you overlooked something?  Support spells: you most definitly want deflect missiles at some point, but not right now- train charms/air a bit after you get more dodging. If you have Ozocubus Armour grab it, its awesome even with low investment. Phase shift: only go for it if you have cblink lying around or lategame.  Invocations: If i remember correctly, slouch has good fail rate at 10 or so- 6 seems a bit low to reliably (<5% fail) you god powers- you need them in an emergency.  That ring: while nice, if it gets you in situations where you have to spend potions too much its a net drain, esp since you should not have that big of a problem with int/wiz (since chei). Rings of fire, as well as the spell ""ring of flames"" are awesome and give huge spellpower boost to all fire spells. Unfortunately they also give rC-. So as soon as you get any rC+ gear you can consider wearing one. Spider and crypt are the last areas of the without cold damage. I'd use that other ring mostly for swapping for sInv, but if you have nothing else shrug.  If you have troubles with shoals,go do some vaults; just play carefully, danger levels can spike very fast due to sealed doors. Good lack."

If a fight goes pear shaped just blink out of it. So. Ash kindly gives you messages which exits are on a given panlevel, and even where they are- ziggurats (any lvl 27 char can handle up to level 8-10 of a zigg, so useful loot may be found here), exits to normal space,exits trough abyss. Many of these portals are in vaults, near a Pan lord, and thats where you can find the normal demonic rune, that spawns randomly on unnamed pan levels. That does not mean that you can access an exit to normal space easily; there are vaults where its easy to get to it, and in others you have to fight 3-4 fiends and a panlord at the same time... Be smart, scout out with scrying, and skip hard sells. unless you are on a named panfloor - you get a warning for that- the fastest way to go trough pan is just taking any and all ""another gate to pandemonium"", check out where an exit is, go there, scry, and if it has no rune and no exit, just go on and forget about it.

Adjust higher if you like.  As for mage combos, I like Conjurer as a good intro one because it's fairly straight forward -- you nuke things from afar. Draconians and Deep Elves make good conjurers (and they're not alone in this). Battlesphere remains very effective well into the midgame, so you're not too reliant on finding alternate books quickly or hybridizing (though you certainly can if you pick up a good weapon).  FE are also very good, but there's a bit more subtlety to them. Conjure Flame and Sticky Flame are extremely effective spells. The former will block a hallway (though unintelligent or overly brave creatures will happily walk right into the flame and fight you), and Sticky Flame does excellent damage early game. The catch with Sticky Flame is, of course, its melee range. You can cast it then start walking away while they melt, but even for that one turn you don't really want to be in melee range of a hydra if you're a DE in cloth. So use it carefully. DE and Dr also make good FE (even if a Dr turns white, they're still a solid fire elementalist if you need them to be), but so do HO for example.  I'm told VM is really good in the early game, but I've hardly ever played it. I can see why -- poison something from a distance, then walk away as it dies. If you can't kill it that's fine, you're not in melee range so you can just walk to a staircase and you're safe.

Most of my deaths in the game were caused by my own negligence; I would often tunnel-vision, especially when reaching new areas or goals for the first time. And that really bothered me, because only seconds of poor judgement would wreck hours of passable decisions. At some point, I saw a post on the official forums about dealing with this. Here are some of the better tips I learned:   Go at your own pace. If you feel pressured or rushed, take a deep breath. If you're in a really tense situation, try to take at least 30 seconds per turn to consider all of your options. Know what your enemies can do, as well as how long it could take them to do it. It's better to ""waste"" a resource than to die and never use it at all; better safe than sorry.  If you're struggling to make a decision or you can't see a way out of a tough spot, walk away for a bit and come back later with fresh eyes.   TL;DR: Overthink everything, and don't be afraid to take a step back from your game.  There's a lot to know in this game, and I think melee classes (primarily Berserkers and Fighters) are a safe (well...) way to learn."
dcss,2zb3u9,chunes,2,Tue Mar 17 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's easy. I always decide to retreat just after I die ;)  Seriously though, be very conservative. Always have an escape planned. If you don't run away. If you find your self thinking you can kill it with just one more hit, then you probably should've retreated. The worst is you will survive often, but the next time you are thinking, two more hits. Just run away.  If you aren't in a good position, ie corridor, near stairs...then run away. Not always possible if it's an open level.   Take breaks. If you've been playing for a while just take a step back and go drink something. When you come back you are less into the moment so possibly more objective."
dcss,2zb3u9,VampoRainze,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:19:08 2015 UTC,"Knowing when to retreat is largely something you learn from experience, and is hard to put into words because it involves knowing what your enemies can do, how strong your defenses really are, and all the tools at your disposal, all of which vary based on the situation. One thing that will certainly help is to avoid playing faster than your experience safely allows.  A lot of newer players die in situations where they had a consumable or ability that would've kept them alive. Scroll of blinking is usually the 'best' escape, and I usually save them for when I am one turn away from death. Other consumables need to be used earlier than that, as fear isn't reliable depending on enemy MR, haste will allow adjacent enemies another hit before you can run, and so on.  By the time you are 75% HP or lower, you should be escaping from the fight unless it's obvious you can safely finish the fight without any risk. Don't keep tabbing and hoping RNG will go your way."

I don't know why exactly but there are times when my mind is like ""ok you should probably retreat here"" and then I walk forward and attack anyway. Almost like I want to see what happens. It's really weird. Probably a carryover from all the other games I play where failure just means an interesting death animation and then a quick load."

Unfortunately for you a lot of this is just knowing what each and every enemy can do and how threatening that is for you right now. Unfortunately these are often learned from experience, although not necessarily deadly. I learnt how bad brimstone fiends are last tournament when I ignored one for about 10 turns for a neqoxec during the orbrun and got taken down to about 20 health, but a lot of luck and a potion of berserk later and I was able to survive that and win the character. My 2nd win learnt how important it is to have rF+ against orbs of fire, when in about 4 turns he went from 160 health to about 10, but a 33% fail semi controlled cblink spell saved me there and I lived to tell the tale.  More recently in the last few months I learnt how bad hornets can be without rPois. Usually I engage spider with rPois, but recently I did without it on a good looking SpEn who got paralysed and then killed by a hornet and his buddies.  Nowadays everytime I see hornets without rPois, or a brimstone fiend at all, I make sure to prioritise handling this situation (whether by fleeing or doing something else). I suspect a lot of the really good players have internalised this to an even greater degree than I have, and flee much more easily."

If you see any of the three enemies I mentioned, consider just running and getting out if the cave without even trying to fight them.  If you get a simulacrum ice cave, remember that they hit extremely hard (and the cold component of their melee attack ignores AC), but are usually slow than you.

Abyss is safe if you have rMut and a stack of permafood. I'd put off Slime as a 5th rune simply because TRJ is just hard to kill.

dcss,2z3imu,Weeksy,23,Sun Mar 15 05:20:02 2015 UTC,"As unsatisfying as the answer may be, it's when you find a weapon that's better. It can of course be a bit tricky to know when that is. Sometimes the best thing to do is just to have a wizard mode character you can test stuff out on until you have a better intuition for it. Here are a few numbers to give you an idea though:   Electrocution brand adds 7+1d13 damage to 1/3 of hits Pain brand adds 1d(Necro) damage to (Necro)/(Necro + 1) hits. Flaming/Freezing increase base damage by an average of 25% Vorpal brands increase base damage by an average of 16.7% Speed brand reduces attack delay by a third, which is similar to increasing damage output by ~50% (same as being hasted). Base damage is multiplied by your skills; enchantments and slaying aren't, so base damage is worth more than slaying. Slaying has more effect on a fast weapon than a slow one (including weapons of speed). Other weapon brands that scale with slaying are venom (more damage = more poison damage), antimagic (more damage = higher chance of miscast), and vampiric (heals 1d(damage done) 60% of attacks).   You can treat elec brand as adding roughly 4.5 damage per swing on average, except that it's spiky (it's actually 13.5 damage on average but on 1/3 of swings), and it ignores AC.  So if you're comparing a whip of elec (6 base, 4.5 elec, 0.5 delay) to a morningstar of flaming (13 base, *1.5 fire, 0.7 delay) I'd make an estimate like my base damage being worth maybe half again (so whip is (6*1.5)+4.5 = 13.5, mstar is (13*1.5)*1.5 = 29.25), but then factor in delay, so whip is 13.5*0.7/0.5 = 18.9 per 0.7 turns. I do a quick wizard mode test and indeed, the morningstar of flaming is a little better (not hugely so, because some of the whip's damage ignores AC, and has a little more accuracy).  Note that base damage being worth 1.5*slaying is a really rough estimate. In practice exactly what it's worth will depend on factors like your weapon skill.  Anyway, that should hopefully give you a rough idea. You don't really need all these numbers precisely, having a rough idea of how to get a half-decent guess is really enough. If the weapons are too close to call and one requires more skill, it can be worth keeping the maybe-inferior one sometimes just so you can put your skill points somewhere more immediately important.  Edit: Unless melee isn't your primary damage source. Then it's ""when you find a weapon that's better and can either warrant the xp going into auxiliary skills or are transitioning to melee-primary focus,"" I suppose. That's a bit more of a build-dependent question though (ex: IE will probably do this sooner than Cj)."

Going from a Spear to a Glaive is a lot of XP, and when that XP could be spent on getting another sweet support spell online (Especially if it means giving up a buckler) I often have a hard time telling which is best.  I know, I know, context is everything, and eventually I just have to go for it. I suppose the more I play hybrid-esque characters the better I will be able to get the timing down. Whenever I switch away I get the feeling I screwed up by leaving too early, and if I die without switching, I feel as though part of my mistake was not switching earlier. It certainly doesn't help that I mentally equate Elec and Pain as brands, even though I know that pain can carry a character much, much farther."

The way that autopickup functions work has changed, so if you used a fancy autopickup function before (like one of those ones that picks up auxiliary armour in slots you haven't got equipment in yet) then you need to adjust it slightly. Whereas before ""return false"" simply didn't add an item to the autopickup, now it means to exclude that item, and ""return nil"" is what ""return false"" used to be.  Roughly speaking you make the following two types of changes:   Everywhere your function had ""return false"", change it to ""return nil"". Everywhere your function had ""return A or B or C"" (for any number of choices), change it to ""return (A or B or C) or nil"". Note the parentheses are important here.   That should fix it to work with the 0.16 update. Pretty sure everything else in your RC should work unedited."

Torment and mummy curse resistance are extremely useful, and request corpses also gives very, very good corpses with high necromancy skill in extended - you can regularly get multiple dragon or giant corpses from a single cast, and a few casts can easily give you an army of Simulacra capable of taking down most Pan and Hell lords (besides maybe Cerebov, his firestorm kills them really quickly).

Stop training spellcasting whenever you feel comfortable with however much mana you have. If you want spell reliability, it's generally far more efficient to train the skill directly.  Consider picking up Blink, apportation, flight, summon butterflies, or some kind of utility-escape spells and putting in about 5 levels for the relevant skill.   You've got quite a few eggs in just a single basket, my friend. Early levels for skills are ridiculously cheap compared to later ones.   With mummy aptitudes: It takes 1903.5 skill points to bring Summonings from 17.0 to 18.0 It takes 1800 skill points to bring Fighting from 0.0 to 8.0  Fighting Level 0.0 : 79 HP Fighting Level 8.0 : 92 HP (+13 hp improvement / 16.5% improvement)  So at the end of the day, you can pick between whatever sounds more appealing to you: A slightly more reliable summoning spell, or a moderate amount of hit points.  http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Skill#Experience_Required  http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Fighting"

It is wielding a dagger of distortion.  The goal here is to allow more tactical combat, by encouraging players to pay attention to enemy brands & react appropriately. In principle that could be done already, by ""treating every glowing weapon as if it was a distortion weapon"" (or other threatening brand), but in practice the huge false positive rate meant that only the very most dedicated players had the patience.  A reasonable concern would be that this will actually increase the attention burden on players - the additional information making players have to pay more attention to enemy weapons, but, in a bad way...? Certainly some thought should be put into reasonable defaults, re message colouring & force_mores.  This is a buff to players, and a flavor nerf to Ash - the latter is unfortunate. Not crippling, but Ash has had a series of flavor nerfs lately, as the ID game changes - probably needs some love soon.  Most brands are shown as usual; known-unbranded but glowing weapons are ""enchanted"".

dcss,2ywno0,WinterShine,6,Fri Mar 13 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Distortion is probably one of the biggest reasons. If you want to play well strategically, you had to be extremely careful around distortion weapons. Generally just not letting them hit you at all is best. The problem with the old system was, every runed weapon might be a distortion weapon. That meant the best strategy was to play extremely cautiously against every enemy holding a runed weapon, even though the majority of the time it wasn't a big deal.  There might be other reasons too, but if I had to wager, that's the one I'd put money on. The devs try to adjust the game so that tedious play isn't encouraged by the mechanics, and top level players (trying to streak wins for example) having to be paranoid about every glowing weapon resulted in tedious play. This change means you find out about the disto weapon before you're in range of it (barring bad luck walking around a corner or something)."
dcss,2yx5nr,dark_frog,2,Fri Mar 13 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Turn off shields -- you don't need more than 15 to eliminate all penalties for medium shields. It's not worth the xp to pump it higher right now. I would turn on dodging, probably turn it to double XP to get it pumped up quickly. Your EV is really low, you should train dodging up to at least 10 or 15 even on heavy armour users. A respectable dodge + shield rating will mean you completely negate a lot of attacks so you won't be so reliant on AC rolls to negate damage.  For weapons, I wouldn't switch to a 2 hander just because you have pumped shield so high already, it would be a big waste of xp. I would clear down to vault 4 and look for a demon trident, if you don't find one I would do crypt. Crypt isn't that deadly and there are often Hell Knights who carry demon weapons. Just avoid be prepared to flee curse skulls. If there is an Ancient Lich in the end vault use your scroll of silence to kill him.  I would dump some of the less useful stuff like ring of dex+3 and your amulet of regen, you already are wearing a regen amulet with slaying on it.   Your strength is high enough, pump dex in future level ups if you aren't already. You don't need more than ~25 strength to adequately wear all types of heavy armour and strength doesn't give you any respectable boost to damage.   Are there any dragon hides laying around (you can ctrl+f dragon).

As for slime: I have seen enough people on reddit ""die like an idiot"" trying to grab it, and you need to get at least rC, better would be rc+, otherwise the cold/azure slimes are going to wreck your shit. There is a good strategy you can do if you want to be relatively safe. First, dive down to the last floor, pop ?mapping. Then stay clear of the stone structure in the middle, if you fight there you will attract attention before you have cleared the perimeter of thelevel of distractions; be sure to clear out all the upstairs  so you can retreat safely. Take ?summoning if you have. Lure TRJ out of the stone structure, haste up (the TRJ is faster than average), quaff agility, and hit TRJ like, two or three times. It will spit out a bunch of jellies. Blink out if you have evocable blink, or a lot of?blinking, read ?immolation, pop one or two of the inner flamed jellies, and watch the chain reaction.

Second, extended has a lot of really dangerous situations that can seem to come out of nowhere, and if you're not experienced in it, it's very likely to just wipe the floor with you at some point or other. (The hells, for example, are rife with situations where you can go from ""totally fine"" to ""totally screwed"" in a few turns.)  Also, I'm not sure this character is terribly well prepared for extended. Very nice defences, and evo is good, but zero support spells, and that vamp mace will stop being useful (vamp won't work on most things in extended). That's a really weak selection of rings too.

At the same time I would kick myself if I passed up an easy chance to go further too (and so far nothing has even come close to killing me, even the 27 headed hydra was a breeze)."
dcss,2ywm1w,Quazifuji,3,Fri Mar 13 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"There isn't really a such thing as an easy chance to go further for the first time.  There are new threats in extended that can very easily kill an unprepared player, no matter how prepared the character is.  I remember someone posting here before who had never won before, but their character was so absurdly powerful that they figured it would be a waste not to go for more.  They got 10 runes and cleared a whole Ziggurat, basically tabbing through it, so they posted asking advice for Hell, and everyone said if they could tab through a Zig they could handle Hell no problem.  They died to some Hellions because they didn't know how to properly handle them.  That's not to say you can't survive your first time in extended, just that you shouldn't try it unless you're prepared not too.  No matter how strong this character is, dying at any part of extended is a very real possibility.  If you'll be crushed if that happens, you should win now.  Anyway, if you can win once you can win more than once.  My first win was an incredibly powerful, lucky character, and it felt like a fluke after playing in and off for years.  I was sure it would be ages before I pulled it off again.  I got my second win a couple months later with 15 runes, my third almost immediately after, and 3 more during a tournament a few weeks after that.  If you can win once, you can win again.  Don't treat this as your last chance to get a win.  If dying in extended will crush you, win now then go for more next time you get the chance."

It's not nearly as strong a char as my GaBe was but it seems like since I slowed down a lot and started playing more carefully I'm consistently getting much further than I used to, and think I have a decent shot at another win.

dcss,2ywm1w,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Sat Mar 14 10:51:26 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that a FoFi of Chei is probably one of the hardest characters to do extended with there is (at least 15 runes, 5 runes is quite doable (I've done it, in fact)).  Formicids are considered a challenge race, and Chei is considered a challenge god, and the combination is particularly challenging.  They're some of the best characters at going toe to toe with enemies in the game and can also cast spells in heavy armour due to the huge Chei stats and great Fo aptitudes, but at the same time, you've basically got not escapes at all besides shafting and Step From Time - even running away isn't an option - and those are both unreliable.  Your lack of escapes and ability to reposition become more and more dangerous as the game goes on, and in extended, enemies with torment or hellfire are really, really, really dangerous - just a single move with a couple of them in sight can drop you from full health to low health (my FoFi of Chei nearly died on the Orb run when a Brimstone Fiend and an Ice Fiend showed up on opposite sides of the screen and I got lost 3 quarters of my health in one mov).  Many already consider Chei a liability in extended, weaker than no god at all, and people tend to advise heavy use of translocations for anyone who is going for more than 5 runes with Chei, which obviously isn't an option for a Formicid.  That's not to dissuade you from trying, just letting you know that a FoFi of Chei is a very fun, but very, very dangerous combo, and that danger probably increases by about 5 times in Pan, Hell, and Tomb."

dcss,2yvcon,SriBri,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:54:48 2015 UTC,"Hey man, glad to hear you were successful trying out some new areas of the game.  Next step is taking the plunge into double digit runes.  To be honest, this character was probably in a better shape than the 14 rune win I had yesterday (just a few hours before you; that's him ranked fourth in your screenshot) after getting four runes.  If you want to seriously consider extended, I would say that dropping Trog is a must.  Believe me, I love Trog, but you can only lug around so many semi-useless randart weapons, and Brothers in Arms serve as little more than meatshields late in the game.    To really push into extended, I'd recommend a swap to The Shining One or Zin.   Personally, as soon as I finish up getting 4 runes (Lair runes, Slime and Vaults), I swap over to The Shining One and clear the Crypt.  This is a really fast source of piety for TSO; on the character I linked I had max piety in two floors.  The penance from Trog or whatever other god you may have left is also pretty manageable here.  As long as you take it easy, you shouldn't be caught out in too dangerous a situation.  Kill a couple of packs of angry ogres and before you know it, you and Trog's rocky relationship is a thing of the past.    TSO has a number of decent abilities for the late game for melee heavy characters.  He lets you buff your shield ability (meh), Gives you an aura that makes it easier to hit enemies (ok) while alerting them to your presence (less ok), heals you when evil things and demons die (sweet), gives you an aoe that deals some pretty nice damage to undead and demons (also sweet; it combines really well with the healing ability too), and lets you summon angel friends, which is essentially a better version of Trog's Brothers in Arms.  Also, he can sometimes straight up save you from death; while it's not exactly something you want to rely on, the characters I've taken to extended have both benefited from a timely save.  TSO's final ability, available at max piety, is the one I like best.  You can pray at his altar to have a weapon blessed, giving it +2 and a holy brand.  If the weapon was a demon weapon, it is converted to a holy counterpart.  When you take these weapons and buff them to +9, they just slice through late game monsters like butter.  Even with TSO's benefits, I've recently taken to switching from TSO to Zin.  Since they're both good gods, you don't incur wrath from switching between the two, and instead get a piety bump from one to the other (if you leave TSO with full piety, you start Zin with like *** or ****).  Zin takes cash donations for piety as well, so it's entirely possible that you can switch from TSO to Zin and be full piety with Zin immediately.  Zin gives you a self buff of your dex, int and str and lets you imprison pesky isolated enemies (great when something is smiting or tormenting you and you need a break).  He protects you from mutations, and at max piety lets you cleanse all your mutations once.  Like TSO, he can also protect you from death.  But what I find best about Zin are his first and last abilities, recite and sanctuary.  Sanctuary creates a zone that creatures can't attack in (and neither can you), hurts evil and undead creatures, and makes monsters flee/fight each other.  It's great when your health drops into the red and you need a minute to plan, quaff potions, or teleport away.  Recitation is an ability that costs no mana, piety or hunger, but takes a few turns to reach full effect (during which time you can attack but not cast spells or read scrolls) and can't be spammed.  It makes intelligent monsters confused, blind, or fall into a deep, deep sleep.  It also has a chance to turn demons and undead into pillars of salt, killing them instantly, or smite them for good chunks of damage.  All Zin's abilities scale with invocation, but get insanely strong late in the game at max invocation.  You can buff, then recite thinning the herd of big demon packs in Hell or Pan, then target the ones not affected by the recitation or the ones that can be the most troublesome.  Recitation also works while you're in sanctuary (unlike other combat forms), meaning if the situation is really dire, you can heal a bit then try to turn some monsters to salt before re-engaging or fleeing.  The bottom line is, now that you have a win under your belt, try and push yourself a bit out of your comfort zone.  Try a new god or two, or try for an extra rune or two during your next game.  Like /u/indspenceable said, SpEn are really fun, but play very  differently.  I remember mentioning the tournament to you in another thread; it's a great place to get more experience/rely on teammates to help you figure out the challenge that is extended.  Heck, if you see me on, feel free to drop into my game to ask for advice, I won't mind."
dcss,2yvcon,AngusOReily,1 point,Fri Mar 13 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"Congrats! The first is always the hardest.   Probably the most danger I was ever in, was V:5, and I deliberately put that off until later since I knew it was dangerous (lost 2 previous 2-rune characters on the stairs).   Yes, Vaults 5 is dangerous. Putting it off as late as you can (still probably before pan and hell if you choose to go that route) is very smart.    19902 | Elf:2 | Gained mutation: You evolve. [potion of beneficial mutation] This was super helpful, and resulted in a bunch of resistance mutations. Also 'Weak 1' which I never did figure out.   Hit 'A' to get a better view of what your mutations are + do.   1) I was tempted to switch from Trog to someone fancier fairly early on after being gifted that sword, but was afraid of his penance. What do I need to have to comfortably change gods away from Trog?   Trog is going to throw BiA at you. If you can deal with Vaults:5 monsters, you can deal with them. The issue, however, is that he throws them at you at random times. So, you get away from a tough fight, and then all the sudden you're surrounded before you get a chance to heal up. You very well might have been able to deal with that at the end of this game... it's kinda hard to tell you, but if you know what you're going into and you give it a shot sometime after 3-5 runes it might go OK. Disclaimer: I've never actually abandoned trog, but I have abandoned a number of other gods.   2) I never trained any ranged skills, instead relying on my Evocations skill (which I never really used). Is there something I could have gained there? Room for character improvement?   Yeah, there is. Clearly, you don't need to do it - nothing in this game is a need to do. But if you try something like a CeHu of Oka and just train bows a ton, you can see how great it is to be able to kill nearly everything before they even reach you. Ranged weapons are great cause they remove risk from attacking, same as evokers. If you have evocables and you have the skill, there's no reason not to use them - just like BiA, having evoked buddies is great.   3) What would this character have needed to venture into the extended game? What would have killed him?   You had awesome gear. I've never taken a troggie through extended, I don't think he's necesarily the best god for it, but it's totally doable. What kills people in extended, though, is hubris - despite you having awesome gear, good piety, and good skills, you can still get hurt REALLY fast. Getting tormented twice on one turn, or a bunch of hellfire from entering a level of pan right next to hellion island or something can almost instantly take you from full health to in the red, no matter how much health you have (stupid HP halving attack!) The reason trog isn't that great in extended is he helps you deal with fights, but not get away, and no matter how much help you have, sometimes you just gotta excape when torment and hellfire are in play.  I'd recommend trying some other combos next - extended is great, and good bragging rights and all, but trying different races really makes you approach the whole game differently. CeHu of Oka is still a martial character but can tend way more ranged, in style. HOFi of Beogh is great fun (some top players talk down about it, cause it won't get you through extended, but it will do great up to zot, at least, and even then you're still skilling like this character so you're immensely powerful even without buddies).  But really, you should play SpEN. Still super powerful, but opposite style, really really makes you think about every encounter you get into without feeling like you never have the tools to take care of it. I won one where I basically camped out on Zot:5, dodging around a wandering Ancient lich, an orb of fire, and a curse toe, until they all finally wandered out of the way to let me dart in and grab the orb and gtfo. Much fun."
dcss,2yvcon,indspenceable,1 point,Fri Mar 13 05:40:41 2015 UTC,"The issue, however, is that he throws them at you at random times.    Divine retribution actually triggers on experience gain now, so it's even more dangerous than random - Trog is likely to throw in some Brothers in Arms in the middle of a tough fight, or immediately afterwards, before you get a chance to rest."

dcss,2yuui7,Gamesmaster1965,3,Fri Mar 13 01:34:51 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - you're generally doing all the right things. Good work. Be extremely careful about branch ends.  1) One source of RPois is fine. If you're tanky enough you can deal without it, but I'd wear the ring if I were you.  2) Resistances are overrated. in general, they're a nice to have - there are some cases where they're very important, but those don't come until very late / in the past-3-rune game territory. If you are fighting (tough) simulacrums, you want to wear some rC. If you're up against Azrael, rF. ETC.  But to actually answer your question, if you can get it you want some decent MR (at least 3 pips is good IMO) to avoid paralysis + banishment from some monsters, and 1 point of rF, rC, and rN. In spider or snake, you want rPois. You'll NEED at least one level of rF (but preferably more) for fighting orbs of fire, when you get to Zot.  3) Your skills look good, generally. Typically, I'd advise focusing on one of Armor or Dodging, but QSDA seems pretty broken so training both is probably good...  So, while you're using your broad axe, you don't need anymore than 18 axes. So make sure to turn that off at that point. If I were you, I'd probably keep fighting + defenses on while I get to that point, too. You've got plenty of evocations for the time being.... If you get evokers, you might want to train it up a bit more, but I'd probably focus on melee skills for now."
dcss,2yuui7,indspenceable,2,Fri Mar 13 00:36:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time for such detailed reply. Glad I'm basically doing the right think I'll take your advice in mind.
dcss,2yuui7,Quazifuji,2,Fri Mar 13 00:55:17 2015 UTC,"1) One source of RPois is fine. If you're tanky enough you can deal without it, but I'd wear the ring if I were you.   rPois doesn't even stack, so if one source of rPois isn't enough then 2 won't be any better anyway."
dcss,2yuui7,Xelif,3,Fri Mar 13 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine in Spider. You should steamroll the first few levels. rPois is really the important thing here, as poison is how most of the spiders deal the real damage (I disagree with /u/indspenceable, one pip of resistance to whatever you're fighting is very important and helpful IMO; also, rPois means you can eat spider flesh).   Plain spiders, trapdoor spiders, redbacks and tarantellas you can tab through if they're not in overwhelming amounts. Berserk probably isn't even necessary. Tarantellas (the purple ones) confuse you; if you're confused while fighting popcorn, remember that SHIFT+direction swings your weapon - use that instead of moving while confused; with an axe you're bound to hit them anyways, so it doesn't matter that much. If facing a number of enemies or with <75% HP, quaff a curing potion.  Look out for wolf spiders and try to fight them individually; they are tanky and hit hard. You should be fine, but since you're a Troglodyte and have plenty of piety, invoke Brothers in Arms against them.  Orb spiders are annoying as shit, since they move away from you and throw orbs of destruction at you. With evocable blink you should be fine - just blink out of the way of their orbs and eventually you'll end up next to them. The way to kill them is to chase them into a corner.  Spider:5 is quite a bit tougher, though it's still arguably the easiest 5th level of any Lair branch. Most layouts are favorable to melee fighters - the rune is often in the back of a long, narrow passageway, the sort you like.  If you ever feel underpowered, remember that you can hop out of Spider and do other branches - clear Dungeon, clear Orc down to 3, etc. That said, I don't think you'll feel underpowered in Spider with this character; since you have good defenses (QDA is ridiculously OP), you'll just ignore the attacks of like 95% of its denizens.  It sucks that you got Shoals as your other Lair branch; Shoals is the toughest of them all."
dcss,2yuui7,Xelif,2,Fri Mar 13 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I really lucked out on drops this run.

dcss,2yuui7,indspenceable,2,Fri Mar 13 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"Remember that you do have two wands of teleport.  When you get ID scrolls, use one on one of them so you're not wasting charges (and you know what you have). There's plenty of ID scrolls to come and your current equipment is fine, so don't worry about ""wasting"" one (it's not a waste when used on a wand of teleport/heal wounds/haste anyways, imo)."
dcss,2yuui7,Xelif,2,Fri Mar 13 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"Alternately for killing orbs is just wand them to death, or order your BiA to kill them, if you've already got some out.

Elemental evocables are good for mobs that have wolf spiders. Phial of floods is good in Spider because the water slows them down."

dcss,2yuui7,WinterShine,3,Fri Mar 13 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what indspenceable said, since it wasn't mentioned explicitly, rPois does not stack. (I think it used to a bit, but that was a long time back.) Having two sources of rPois is exactly the same as having only one.  I'd mostly agree with indspenceable on resistances, except I find rN basically worthless. In a 3-rune game there's a couple types of enemies it might be worth swapping it for, but usually I can't be bothered to make the inventory space to carry an rN ring around. Don't forget the MR from Trog's Hand. You should use it any time you have to fight something that can banish, paralyze, etc. As for rF and rC, it's nice, but not vital, to have a source of them you can swap in. Getting ++ or +++ in either is mostly pointless, except for rF in Zot.   On a normal sized race you need 5 (learndb now says 4, has this changed?) Shields skill to use a buckler, 15 to use a shield, and 25 to use a large shield without penalty, and it's really not worth training more than that. For the most part axes make terrible one-handed weapons (they just don't compare to the best one-handers from other categories), so you're going to eventually want to upgrade to a good two-hander anyway (though that particular broad axe will likely last you a long time before this comes up, unless Trog gives you something equally great in a 2-handed flavour).  Note that SH isn't really as good of a defence as either AC or EV. It's nice, but not vital.  Oh, and speaking of eventually swapping that weapon, don't worry about the points spent in Evo having been wasted or anything. Two reasons. First, training for what's useful now is better than worrying about your training late game (especially on a berserker who will have more skill XP than they know what to do with). Second, evo is amazing with Trog. You already have three of the elemental evokers, and if you get a rod or two, it's even better. (Tip: Trog-worshippers are guaranteed a rod if they pick staff acquirement from a scroll of acquirement.)  Short version: Looks like you've been training just fine.  Since your defences are pretty good for where you are, training more weapon skill is perfectly fine. Don't be too focused on mindelay. It is important, but if your offence is good enough to kill everything it needs to on the floor you're on, keeping your defences up in between is important too. You don't need to look on the wiki for mindelay numbers -- if you look at a weapon in your inventory (on the inv screen just press the letter for the weapon) it will tell you its base delay and minimum delay. Every 2 levels of skill reduces delay by 0.1. When you swing the weapon (or do any other action), the number in brackets next to the ""Time"" stat on the right will tell you how long it took.  Whenever you don't know what else to train, just train defences. (Fighting is a combination of defence and offence.)  As for branches, you should do Orc after Lair. Orc:1-3 should be child's play. On Orc:4 you should be a bit more careful, but it oughtn't to be a big problem, just take care around the sorcerers, high priests, and warlords. Orc:4 has four guaranteed shops (unless one is a mimic, not sure if that can still happen) which can be very useful (evokables, rods, missing jewellery, etc.). I usually finish off D:1-15 before doing Lair branches too.  You're at the stage where you should mostly try to avoid berzerking by the by. It leaves you slowed and exhausted, which can be pretty deadly. Brothers in Arms is much safer, whether you want to use the ally to help you kill an enemy faster, or to buy you some time to walk away from a dangerous fight."
dcss,2yuui7,WinterShine,2,Fri Mar 13 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"Great! Thanks for the help. The tip about getting a rod from Trog is a  nice tip. Would make sense because he hates magic users so much. Recently I've found I haven't needed to bezerk at all, I'll save it for emergencies like you say. Hopefully i'll see myself out the other end of spiders!"
dcss,2yuui7,WinterShine,2,Fri Mar 13 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"Cheers! The reason for the staff acquirement thing is that acquirement is guaranteed to never give you a useless item. (""Useless"" here means you cannot use it due to equipment restrictions, god restrictions, etc. -- the items that appear in gray or red text. You can still acquire a -3 cloak {rF-, curse}, since that is not, by this definition, ""useless."")

The hydra's MR is 120, so a scroll of fear might work.   I would not want to fight it, you'll probably get killed. On top of the damage output, you'll be cutting off the hydra heads and making it grow more, so that's a bad idea.  You overtrained Shields I think. I'm pretty sure you only need 15 shields for Formicids.  Here's something you could do. Climb up the stairs, blink, then shaft yourself. To make the chances better, you can blink, then if you're a bit away, you can read ?fog, and move so you can't see the squares toward the Hydra. That was you could blink again and have a much higher chance of blinking farther away from the Hydra (and then shaft yourself).  Don't drink potions of mutations, it's never worth the risk."

What changes is how much time passes during those attacks. If you're using a demon whip with delay 0.5 against a monster with delay 1.0, then you will (on average) be able to swing at him twice for every swing  he makes at you. Similarly if you're wielding a really slow weapon with delay 2.0 then the same monster will get twice as many swings in on you.  Part of the reason mindelay is so highly valued in the community is that it gives you more time to react when something goes wrong. If you're wielding a weapon of delay 1.0 and an ettin comes along with two dire flail attacks, and luckily lands both of them for 90 damage, leaving you with 20, its nice to now have the option to escape rather than continue attacking. If you're wielding a weapon with delay 2.0 that ettin gets yet another chance to attack you before your escape options come available."

I have followed the min delay advice and won several games with melee fighters, without really poring over the game's message history very closely for fights that took a while to finish the enemy off.    Makes much more sense now."
dcss,2yqgi3,WinterShine,5,Thu Mar 12 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"One handy thing to know about is the ""Time"" stat that shows on the right hand side. It shows the amount of turns (using the 1 turn = 10 auts definition), but it also shows in brackets how much time has passed since your last action.  For example, when my current character swings with an attack, I see there ""Time: 61719.9 (0.6)"", which means that attack took 0.6 turns (6 auts) to perform. It also works when resting (if your rest is interrupted before 100 turns, the number in brackets will show you how much time did pass), exploring, and any other sort of action. That will also help you get an idea of how long it takes to do things like switching weapons or jewelry (good to know if you may need to do so in combat).  Spells don't have a unique delay mechanic like weapons do, but they are affected by Haste and Slow like pretty much everything else. Spells will cast at delay 1.0 normally."
dcss,2yqgi3,Xelif,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"Note that the min delay advice - which is usually ""train weapon until min delay first"" - isn't really the best strategy.  The general skilling strategy is:  Train your ability to kill dudes until you can kill dudes well enough for your current location. I generally figure that I want to be able to tab through ""popcorn"" (dark grey and some white names), I want to be able to defeat the standard enemies for the location with minimal thinking, I want to be able to defeat more dangerous, but still common enemies with thought and positioning (and perhaps a consumable or two), and I want to be able to defeat most high-level and unique enemies for the depth with consumable use (might + agility) and a careful approach.  So, for example, on Lair:1, you should be able to tab your way through a pack of river rats or whatever, you should be able to defeat a pack of yaks with good positioning (using a hallway to fight 1v1 or 2v1 instead of facing the entire pack), and you should be able to defeat a spiny frog or komodo dragon with careful play and perhaps a consumable or piety-limited god ability. As you go further into the game, kill-dudes expands to include Evocations, Invocations for some gods, and magic schools for buffs (mostly Charms) and debuffs (mostly Hexes).  Once you can kill dudes well for your depth, train stay-alive skills: Fighting, Armour, Dodging, Shields, Stealth, and/or magic skills, depending on class and build and what the dungeon has given you. Fighting is a special case because it helps both kill-dudes and stay-alive (it increases your HP), but doesn't help either as much as your weapon skill or Armour/Dodging/Stealth respectively. Shields is generally the lowest priority for stay-alive skills.  Once you are both killing dudes and staying alive, you can train utility skills - for a melee character ""utility skills"" is usually synonymous with magic schools (Translocations for blinking, Summoning for meat shields, etc). I personally don't really think of them as ""utility skills"", though - either the skill helps you kill dudes by making you more powerful, or helps you stay alive by helping you position appropriately or escape danger."

It's important to note that faster attacks leads to much greater damage per turn, say 10 attacks at 1.0 delay each doing 5 damage = 50 damage. If you get that down to 0.8 delay, you get ~62 damage in the same 10 turns (worth of time, it's 12ish turns of attacking). Even more important than that is if you consider an enemy having 30 health, you'd kill them in 6 turns at 1.0 attack delay, versus 4.8ish turns."

dcss,2yqgi3,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"Triorph and Winter shine have already given good info on what attack delay means, but I can also add how to calculate it if you don't know:  With 0 weapon skill, your weapon delay will be the base delay.  Every 2 skill decreases your delay by 0.1, to a minimum of your min-delay.  For example, a demon whip has a base delay of 1.1 and a min-delay of 0.5.  So at 0 maces and flails skill, your delay is 1.1 (i.e. it takes 1.1 turns/11 auts to attack with it).  At 8 skill, your delay would be 0.7.  At 12 or higher skill, it would be 0.5.  Ranged weapons work the same way as long as you're in version 0.15 or newer (in earlier versions it's much more complicated and affected by your strength and Dex).  I forget the exact formula for unarmed.  You can also always just use the trick wintershine mentioned yo check your attack speed if you're unsure.  Just attack and see how long it took."
dcss,2yqgi3,T0lias,3,Thu Mar 12 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"With unarmed you begin at 1.0 delay at zero skill and every 5.4 points of unarmed combat skill decreases your attack delay by 0.1 [to the maximum of 0.5 at 27 skill]. Additionally each point of unarmed skill increases your base damage by 1 [base damage at zero skill is 3 if I remember correctly].  Furthermore, heavy armours have larger penalties on unarmed combat and shields introduce a chance to increase your attack delay by 0.1 as well as usual penalties for lack of skill."

Wands auto-ID type but will waste charges if you don't use a scroll of identify on them.  The biggest threat in my mind, is that when you get to depths a new monster called ""Caustic Shrike"" may spawn. These little buggers are ridiculously fast, do high damage, and corrode your equipment. They often spawn in packs of 3 (and as high as 6).  In Cocytus there's a variant called shard shrike that are also dangerous, but you don't need to face that in a 3 rune game.

That would let you use Makhleb summons with a reasonably low chance that they will be hostile when you summon them.

You might also find potions of cure mutation on the Depths floors or in shops there.    Congrats to you by the way on getting the Vaults:5 rune before even touching the Depths.    No small feat there!    I always try to go down to at least Depths:4 before going for the silver rune.  My suggestion on Invocations is because makhleb, TSO, Zin & Elyvilon's abilities work really well when you have high Invo.    So training it with Makhleb would transition that skill well if you want to switch gods later.    Of course the good gods are gonna forbid you from using that vampiric axe, so before switching gods you need to either rebrand it or use a different weapon as your main kill method.    You could rebrand it, but a draining brand or poison brand will be equally forbidden by TSO.  Do you have another high damage axe?"

By all means, switch gods, get your exec axe branded, BUT! while TSO is great for a melee brute, they offer no emergency panic buttons. Which, as VS, esp for the first time in extended, you are at some point probably going to need, since you have no device heal status. So maybe consider Zin (or Ely since you are in trunk). Both have very good emergency buttons."
dcss,2yj8h5,Fambida,2,Tue Mar 10 10:09:13 2015 UTC,Has Ely had changes in trunk recently?  I've always found it incredibly difficult to maintain any decent level of piety with him. The panic buttons are no good if you can never even use 'em.

dcss,2yj8h5,clamsarepeople2,2,Tue Mar 10 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"General advice for extended is to let your resistances guide you. Pan is generally better than Hell, but you wander levels until you end up in one of the rune floors which are all quite different. Which means you might have to abandon a 15 rune run due to drawing the Pan Lord you're not ready to deal with.  Hell is at least a straighforwatd challenge, you pick which branches you're ready for. So I'd suggest doing the Hells you're comfortable with before Pan until you are sure you can face off any of the Lords there.   Also, make sure to check out the crawl wiki page for each of the Archdemons in Hell and the pre-set Pandemonium Lords. They're all quite dangerous, so you'll want an idea of what you're up against. Hell is constantly assaulting you with random things which are all awful, so it's best not to ever push on exploring when you're below half health or so. All up-stairs instead just lead back to the vestibule, which makes escape from those branches much easier, so by all means take a few attempts to clear down to/through the 7th floor in each of the Hells. Also, move your item cache to the vestibule, it's closer to everywhere you need to go in extended and it's a valid cache location as it spawns virtually nothing once cleared."
dcss,2yi25b,LipsAre,7,Mon Mar 9 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Your defenses are very low for a character your level (SH is useful but less important than AC and EV), and your skills are a mess.   You really need more polearms skill.  A bardiche takes 26 skill to use at min delay.  You have 10.  You're not getting anywhere near the offense you want out of that.  For a heavily-armoured formicid using a bardiche, polearms is probably your most important skill. You really need more armour and dodging.  21 Ac and 7 EV is terrible for a level 17 character in heavy armour. You should have stopped training shields at 15.  Turn it off now and never turn it on again.  15 shields skill is enough to eliminate the penalty of a large shield for a formicid (it's 25 for most normal-sized races, but formicids have the same penalties as a large race, which is 3 to remove buckler penalties, 9 for a regular shield, and 15 for a large shield).  The benefits of continuing to train shields skill after you've eliminated the penalties are mostly negligible and probably never worth it unless you have nothing else to train (which shouldn't happen unless you're worshipping Trog or grinding Ziggurats, and if you're worshipping Trog you should probably be using a two-handed weapon ayway).  I probably would have stayed at 9 shield skill with a regular shield until my armour skill was a bit higher, but getting 15 to use a large shield wasn't a bad idea.  Continuing to train it past that was. I'd stop training magic for now.  At the very least, I think armour and polearms should be much higher priority for now, and possibly fighting, dodging, and invocations too. Once you do train magic, focus, and don't bother with spellcasting.  Choose what spell or school you want to get online next, and train only that spell's schools until you're happy its failure rate.  Then move on to the next spell/school.  If you train 3 different schools for 3 different spells at once, it will take just as long to get all 3 spells castable, but you won't get any of them castable sooner than that.  Only train spellcasting if you need spell levels or are having problems with spell hunger, training spell schools is much, much better for decreasing spell failure rate.  Neither spell hunger nor spell levels should be an issue for this character any time in the remotely near future, so just ignore it for the time being.   TL;DR (More of a Conclusion/Summary, really): Focus your skill training.  Train your skills towards one goal at a time (boosting damage, boosting defenses, getting a specific spell or multiple spells from the same school online, etc).  I would prioritize your skills in this order:  Polearms (offense) (you'll eventually want 26, but you don't need that much yet) -> Armour (primary defense) -> Fighting, Dodging (secondary defenses), Invocations (Lugonu Abilities - she's not super useful without it) -> Spells (pick one spell at a time, train that spell's schools until it's castable before moving on to the next one).    Stop training shields, don't train any more for the rest of the game.  Stop training spellcasting, only train more if you either are having a problem with spellhunger or need more spell levels, both of which are extremely unlikely to happen for the rest of the game (only worry about spell hunger if you're finding yourself near starving or starving mid fight, or if you'e almost out of permafood (should never happend), not just if the numbers seem high in the spells screen)."

Xom's nuttiness has made this game interesting to say the least but being a troll helps since I can just focus on UC and he can't switch my +5 sword of chaos with an orc wizard's +0 dagger, so thats a plus.  He hasn't been giving me bad effects very much because i've kept him amused.  I put on a cursed amulet of inaccuracy on d:3 and had to fight a couple of levels with it on (Xom thinks this is Hilarious!).  I also keep a wand of random effects on me at all times because it amuses him when you use it in dangerous combat and keeps him from getting bored.  He's only actually gotten bored two or three times so far and the worst thing he's done has been to summon a swarm of 10 or so friendly imps while i was fighting Eustashio early.  wouldn't have been bad if they hadn't all turned hostile after 10 turns...  overall he's been good to me, summoning large swarms of friendly mobs, giving me haste etc  He gave out the mutations pretty fast but he took away most of my scale mutations in spider as well as one pip of fire resist.

dcss,2yh4cy,panicakess,3,Mon Mar 9 19:46:26 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, it's DsWn. I only point it out because Wa is a bit ambiguous (it's not clear at first whether you meant Warper or Wanderer). Also, I started writing this post thinking you were a Deep Elf trying to melee.  And wow, you walked by a lot of altars without picking one. My usual advice is to pick early when it's at all reasonable. I don't know if I'd pick Sif Muna if I weren't heavily magic-focused (picking Sif Muna is more about the channelling than the gifts early game), but D:4 Oka would've been a fine pick (Heroism is a solid *..... ability).  Yredelemnul on D:7 also solid, and of course the temple there. You definitely shouldn't have waited until after the temple to pick.  Ash is a very good god, but you've waited so long you'll want to get piety as quickly as you can, and no remove curse scrolls this far into the game is a big drawback. (You'll get some piety without cursing more gear, but it'll be slow.)  Honestly, most of the gods would be an okay pick. Kiku gives you allies to reach through with your polearms. Yre gives you stronger ones, but less replenishable, and other abilities. Dith's advantages are mostly universal, except for the shadow step thing. Makhleb is just plain good. Nemelex gives you summons, escapes, and offensive spells all for Evocations skill alone.   Anyway, the point is that most gods are good. It's usually best to pick one early so that by this point you're already on ****.. or better piety and you can actually be using their better powers.  As for what to train, I'd turn off Stealth for now (you have too many other priorities to burn a lot into that just yet). I'd probably top off Polearms at 12 for minimum delay, and then pump Dodging for a bit. After that you're probably going to be getting some Invo for whichever god you picked. From there you can go with whatever the dungeon gives you.  I strongly advise you to identify that wand of teleportation. You've got 13 ID scrolls, and identifying it will (1) prevent you from learning at the wrong time that your wand is empty, and (2) prevent you from wasting charges due to evoking an unidentified wand.  Careful with that gold dragon hide. With only 13 Str, I'm not sure if you'll get much out of it. I can't test in wizard mode right now, but I'd bank on it destroying your EV and probably dealing a noticeable hit to your overall damage output."

dcss,2yh4cy,WinterShine,2,Mon Mar 9 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, this it the main down side of playing Ash that you can change your equipment less frequently. He gives you massive skill boosts though which makes it worth it. I agree that you want to swap to that leather armour soon (and maybe the axe, except I think it puts you under mesmerise status as you wield it, so be careful with that).  Typically when I'm playing an early-mid game ash-caster I curse most of my armour, leave my weapon free to swap between blowguns and whatever else I need, and curse 2 jewellery slots, leaving one for swapping resists."

dcss,2yc5ws,Hero-Sloth,6,Sun Mar 8 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"At this early stage I'd recommend just playing more. You'll need to get used to what things are dangerous, and what aren't in various situations, and it comes largely from experience.   If you press 'x', you can examine things around you. Select an enemy with the cursor and press 'v', and the game will give you more detailed information about them.  As for order of branches, typically it's as follows. Do Lair as soon as you find it, but not the branches inside Lair. When you're done Lair, do Orc. Be careful on Orc:4, it's more dangerous than previous floors. Then do the rest of Dungeon (down to D:15). After that you'll do whichever two Lair branches other than Slime you got, possibly skipping the last floor. After clearing floors 1-4 of both, pick one to go for the rune from. With a rune you can do Vaults:1-4, skipping its last floor. Then do all of Depths. Then you need to get three runes: get whichever of those two Lair runes you skipped before, and then either Slime or Vaults rune (read up on both). Usually Vaults. With three runes you can enter Zot and win.  A few last general pointers. Bravery gets you killed, you need to play cautiously. Try not to walk toward enemies in your line of sight; instead, walk back into safe territory you've already explored and fight them there where more won't hear the combat. With skills and strategic items like enchant scrolls, do what benefits you immediately, don't plan for what you want at end game. Use your consumables!"
dcss,2yc5ws,WinterShine,2,Sun Mar 8 14:42:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for all of the tips :)  Saving consumables is probably something I need to work on.  I was holding on to a load of mediocre potions and scrolls for quite some time.  What would be your advice in regards to race/class combo?  Do you think I should just stick with MiBe for now?  I'd quite like to experiment with different combinations but I feel like it probably won't go terribly well for me.
dcss,2yc5ws,WinterShine,5,Sun Mar 8 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd say go for it. Yes, most will be harder for a new player than MiBe. But you're not likely to win MiBe on your first dozen tries either. In fact, Trog can make it so that you can win fights you probably shouldn't be picking, so playing combos that are weaker in the early game might help you get a feel for how cautiously you need to handle certain things, which will in turn help you play more carefully when/if you go back to MiBe.  In any case, it's a game, so you ought to do what's fun, right? So try different combos and gods if you like, it'll be good experience. I typically go with the first altar I find that makes some sense for my combo. Most gods work well with any build. Oka and Trog are melee, Vehumet and Sif Muna are for spellcasters, the rest are fairly universal."
dcss,2yc5ws,Phantom_Nishoba,2,Sun Mar 8 15:02:01 2015 UTC,"In that case I'll try something new (but still sensible) for my next run.  Thanks.   In fact, Trog can make it so that you can win fights you probably shouldn't be picking   Hmm, I never would have thought of that."
dcss,2yc5ws,AngusOReily,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite combo is a Vine Stalker Berserker. Vine Stalkers, in spite of their spriggan sized health pools, are an extremely durable race once you get it going. Innate Spirit Shield combined with an auxiliary attack that restores mana means you get a lot of damage shifted to your mana pool (which you wont really use much with trog).  On the topic of trog, he is immensely helpful in letting you take out things that other people would have to run from. Berserk gives haste, might and +50% hp, so if you see something even remotely dangerous (like a d:3 ogre) berserk would let you take it down where others would run."
dcss,2yc5ws,ManMan91,2,Sun Mar 8 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like Gargoyle Be as a starting character.  You get an AC bonus, poison and electricity resist, and perma flight at level 14.  It's the combo I used to get my first 3 and 15 wins (in the same run no less).  Other combos I really like are Spriggan Enchanter, using spells in the early game to stun and stab, adding in summons in the later game to help take down big packs of enemies and let you sneak in for a stab or two.  I also worship Dithmenos for extra stabby goodness.  Deep Elf Fire Elementalists are also strong, but very much glass cannons.  However, for me those three are my favorite takes on traditional warriors, rogues, and mages.  The point about footwork is also the most important thing to learn.  Almost always it is right to step back, rather than forward.  You want monsters to come to you; if you go to them, you have a chance of drawing in additional monsters which will turn the tide of battle against you.  Stair dancing is one of my favorite skills: essentially, stand on a down stair, go down just to peek, and then retreat upstairs with an enemy or two in tow.  As long as you don't get completely surrounded, you can pull small groups up in melee range and deal with them without pesky casters picking you off from the back.  Note that this doesn't exactly work on Vaults 5, so beware of getting too used to it.    Also, know when to use Brothers in Arms.  The general rule is, as /u/WinterShine stated ""do what benefits you now"".  I love to hoard, so this was one of the hardest things for me to get used to, but you can't use stuff when you're dead.  If it looks like you might be in trouble, don't wait a few rounds to see if you'll be able to deal with it, since you might be in a position where it will be impossible to recover.  That means bringing in summons with Trog early if it even looks like it might get hairy.  Also, as you get deeper, watch out about relying on berserking, since it can leave you slowed in a really bad spot.  Same goes for potions and wands; they do you no benefit if you're a ghost.  The real advice is to just play more and more.  There's actually a tournament coming up next week where people split off into teams of 6 and play online.  I did one last spring and, while I was pretty inexperienced at the time, was able to get my first two wins during the tournament.  Having teammates is great, especially people who have won before, since they can pop in to watch your game and give you pointers.  I have to give credit to /u/manman91, since he coached me through some really tight spots last year, and made me a better player.  If you can, I highly recommend it."

If you're interested, I posted in the Team Splat thread to join up if they have a spot: http://www.reddit.com/r/DCSStourney/comments/2yd0bc/016_teamsplat_thread/"
dcss,2yc5ws,AngusOReily,3,Mon Mar 9 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could join you guys - I had a great time with Team Splat last time - but it just won't work. Crawl and I have an all-or-nothing relationship, so if I join I'll be in it to win it, and like you said I don't have enough time for that. I did the math a while ago and I averaged 5+hours/day between the 0.14 tournament and when I stopped playing in January (there's a reason why I'm good haha). As much as I love Crawl, there are more important things in my life, and since moderation isn't an option (I've tried), I'll likely not be playing Crawl ever again."
dcss,2yc5ws,SriBri,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well, real life is certainly more important.  I was actually writing the first draft of the paper that I'm presenting at this conference during the .14 tournament, and it's needed quite a bit of work to become presentable.  I certainly should have spent more time on the paper during the tournament.  Anyway, I wish you the best with your grad projects (math, right?).  If you ever need a break and want to watch, feel free to jump in my game."
dcss,2yc5ws,AngusOReily,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to get involved with a team, but I'm not very good yet. Only 1 3-rune win under my belt as a simple MiFi of Oka. It looks like Team Splat is pretty popular, and fills up quick. Any other teams I might be able to snag a spot on?"
dcss,2yc5ws,anhero23,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"Experience isn't necessary.  When I took part in my first tournament, I had yet to get a rune, then after a few early deaths in the tournament I took a GrBe on a 15 rune win.  Teams are great for building experience, and if you already have a 3 rune win, you're in great shape.  As for finding a team, I first found my team from a reddit post.  This year I tried to sign up for a spot on Team Splat, which is pending if they have enough spots (and it looks like they're tentatively full).  I'd make a post on this sub looking for teammates; I'm sure you'll find someone to join up.  Also, if you let me know the name you play under, I'd be happy to watch you run and provide some support even if you're not on my team during the tournament, since it's all in good fun :)"
dcss,2yc5ws,LipsAre,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"To add to his tips, if you find a scroll of brand weapon (or a branded weapon) and get lucky with a freezing brand, use it if the weapon is heavy. Freezing does damage based on the weapon hit. Harder hit, more freezing (same with fire but more monsters don't resist freezing). Light fast weapons should have electricity brands. Brands like electricity, pain (use if you have necromancy skill), draining, and poison will apply the same effect no matter how much damage you do, so it's better to put them on fast weapons."
dcss,2yc5ws,pereza0,0,Sun Mar 8 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"Try spriggians, and deamonspawns. They are fun to play as a beginner and both offer unique variations on traditional gameplay. You should also try the venom mage class, its a strong class for beginners and will allow you to get used to the mechanics of spellcasting.   So much of the game is footwork. Knowing where to step in certian situaions. This game is unrelenting and one wrong step can be the beginning of the end of any character, even advanced lvl superheros...  get to know what the spells are, how they work; what special abilities you like; what gods you like; and generally how you want to play (melee, spells, snipper, all or both.) the world of the dungeon is wide open!"

That shit's suspicious. It's all a conspiracy man! They knew what I was up to. I only played gargoyle to get the torment resistance. Hell, after a while, that's the only damage (along with smiting) that you worry about as a fighter of oka. How the hell am I supposed to have a chance at 15 rune games if I can't find any healing resources as a gargoyle?"
dcss,2y93h1,SuperDuckQ,11,Sat Mar 7 17:03:26 2015 UTC,"RNGesus giveth, RNGesus taketh away. If you're resting to heal between fights and not getting surrounded all the time (use corridors), you can do well without one. A source of regeneration (like Trog's hand) can help a lot, too."
dcss,2y93h1,gopack123,2,Sat Mar 7 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah yeah... I know how to rest and not get surrounded. Wands of healing are really only useful to me in those situations with tormentors. Even with scrolls of fog or going invisible, there will just have to be some times that I need to pop some heals. This is late game stuff... I just can't seem to find any wands of healing. I once a whole gargoyle game with up to 20 scrolls of recharge but no wand. I could have had it all...  And I don't thing Trog's hand is quick enough for the situations I'm talking about. However... I haven't given Trog many tries. I should use him with a gargoyle."
dcss,2y93h1,Baloroth,6,Sat Mar 7 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"If you need one late, use a scroll of acquirement on wands. It is weighted to give you either Heal, Haste, or Tele depending one which ones you haven't found. Some people always want to gamble acquirement on uber armour or jewelry but the wand is probably more useful than anything else you'll get."

dcss,2y93h1,pereza0,3,Sat Mar 7 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"I've been playing a lot of melee gargoyles lately and if you're in the late game and get into a situation where you're running out of hp and NEED a quick heal, it's usually when you're suddenly being spammed by damage that ignores your (ridiculous) AC and you need to either disappear asap or nuke them anyway. Healing just wastes you a turn without much of a hp profit (if any at all). And when you really do need that little heal, potions of healing are usually sufficient, because you don't need to use them much before extended and should have them saved up. Missing the wand seems to be less of an issue than with some other races, especially if you have some regen."
dcss,2y93h1,pereza0,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been able to (if I find the right resistances, etc) keep myself from being megaspammed during late game. Healing wands would actually be pretty useful for the situations I'm talking about. I am able to use nukes and I can keep myself from line of sight... but the healing potions you've mentioned? I also almost find none.  It's like RNG just decides that gargoyles don't deserve shit. At least it seems like it to me..."
dcss,2y93h1,Lucifer_Hirsch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what situations with tormentors you mean, because they are usually a joke to gargoyles (unless you meet them too early or something). They will hurt you, but can hardly kill you.  I mostly meant hellfire and smite spam. You can't get resistances to those. There's not much that can hurt a late game gargoyle, but these are your bane do to your low max hp."

dcss,2y8ivs,Fambida,9,Sat Mar 7 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"At max power it does 3d20, 60% nonresistable damage. That's just plain good for a level 4 spell. Compare to something like mystic blast that does 2d22. Ice beasts are going to be better against fodder enemies since they can take out multiple ones, but icicle is going to take a hydra down in 2-3 casts while a hydra will shred through your ice beasts."
dcss,2y8ivs,gopack123,2,Sat Mar 7 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't used it much, having started Cj too often, but this is probably the answer.  Icicle maintains usefulness into later in the game!"
dcss,2y8ivs,I_Probably_Think,3,Sat Mar 7 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"I mean other people have pointed out the numbers on it, so it is kind of personal opinion, but I think throw icicle is probably the best early to early-midgame damage dealing spells. I generally play wizards worshipping vehement so by lair I have all the utility spells I want, I just want something that can deal damage. Throw icicle might be single target, but it does a lot of damage for your mana and doesn't summon the whole lair floor like fireball does. It's a very good holdover until I can get my favorite level 6 spells online."
dcss,2y8ivs,Seraphtheol,2,Sat Mar 7 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Nothing's stopping you from learning both throw icicle and ice beast. Icicle can be more reliable and faster damage than waiting for ice beasts to slowly trudge to enemies. It has its uses, even if ice beasts are more versatile. You can begin a fight summoning ice beasts and then icicle priority targets."
dcss,2y8ivs,zxc223,0,Sat Mar 7 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"I did learn both, but it still seems like Icicle is shit. I can melee instead and get stabs, even mace and flails stabs, and have more effect that trying to spend my last 10 mp on 2 casts of icicle. Better to melee and save the MP for when I have to cast Ice Beast again.  It really feels like Icicle should be a lvl 3 spell instead of lvl 4. Heck, maybe even lvl 2, since early ice is lacking in the AoE other elements get."
dcss,2y8ivs,DicemanCometh,4,Sat Mar 7 13:23:50 2015 UTC,Your spell power must be fairly low. Throw icicle remains highly damaging even into the vaults and the depths if you make sure to train ice and conjurations and raise intelligence.
dcss,2y8ivs,WinterShine,2,Sat Mar 7 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Might be worth noting that 60% of throw icicle damage ignores cold resistance (its damage is partly physical, not pure cold like Bolt of Cold is), which can be handy. It's probably more useful on a Veh/Sif character, or someone who found =power, |power, etc.   I do have a tendency to skip it myself, given an IE often prefers to transition melee. I'm not convinced going for both of these level 4 spells before getting some defences is good, and S. Ice Beast is clearly the one you want if you are getting only one of the two."
dcss,2y8ivs,WinterShine,1 point,Sat Mar 7 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"That's sort of what I'm asking about. I mean, my char IS a Vehumet guy, and Icicle still seems shitty. I think I'm going to forget it as soon as possible and use the spell levels for freezing cloud when I can. Also ice beasts do phys+ ice just like Icicle, if maybe not in the exact same ratio."
dcss,2y8ivs,mdw,2,Sat Mar 7 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"If you need the levels and have some other non-cold attack you can rely on (melee counts) then I can certainly see that. I don't know what the ratio is for ice beasts, but I know that in early D I will refuse to fight them without rC, and consider them mostly a joke with rC. I've been spiked more than once by their ice branded attack without protection, but they've always been pushovers with rC."

As you say ctrl+f does the job too, although a bit  slower."
dcss,2y7ql1,triorph,3,Sun Mar 8 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"True & a very handy trick.  What's not a handy trick:  pressing CTL+n, when trying to attack diagonally down to the right, opens a new Chrome browser window instead :-(.  Can't win them all!"
dcss,2y7l0o,LipsAre,9,Sat Mar 7 04:08:27 2015 UTC,"First, you may be aware of this, but if not: know that formicids are a challenge race.  They're very strong most of the time, but their permastasis is a really, really big penalty, because it stops them from using the three best escapes in the game (teleport, blink, haste), as well as the best offensive buff in the game (haste).  Playing as a formicid requires playing very carefully, because your ability to get out of situations is very limited so you have to make sure you don't get into them in the first place.  One way to solve this is with god choice.  Gods that offer build in escapes are very useful on formicids because your other escape options are so limited.  Lugonu is probably the best formicid god, but since you didn't start as an Abyssal Knight that's probably not an option.  Zin and Ely can both work as general-purpose options that provide some good tools for emergencies where you'd normally use haste/teleport/blink.  Ru can also be good in trunk, but that's not an option since you're in an old version.  Chei can also work, but is very tricky.  On the one hand, Chei gives you step from time as an escape, and one of Chei's downsides, no haste, doesn't matter because you can't haste anyway.  On the other hand, Chei stops you from using one of the few escapes (and one of the better ones) that you have - walking away from enemies that aren't faster than you (seriously, walking away from enemies is the best move in the game).  Overall, a Formicid of Chei can work, and is very fun, but also very challenging.  Anyway, other formicid advice:   Use a two-hander and a shield.  No reason not too, really.  It's a great feature, take advantage of it. Digging killholes is very handy.  If you don't know, a killhole is a zig-zagging passage in a wall where if you stand at the back of it, only the tile right next to you is visible.  Killholes are a way of guaranteeing only one enemy can attack you at a time, even if some have ranged attacks/smite-targeting/summons.  Normally the downside is that you can't escape them without teleporting, but in the right position a formicid can just dig out through the back if things go wrong. Formicids have great aptitudes, take advantage of it.  Formicids are very good at both spells and melee, so using a mix of both is a good idea.  Focus on one to start, but once you've got your core offense and defense online, don't be afraid to mix some of the other in there.  Really, this is a good idea on basically any character who doesn't worship Trog, but since formicids have such versatile aptitudes and need all the tools they can get it's particularly a good idea for them.   For this character in particular:   Have you found a better weapon?  Grab a two-handed weapon soon if you can find one (if you're going polearms you're likely to get a halberd from a gnoll soon if you haven't yet).  You always want to do this on a formicid, and spears are a particularly lackluster weapon.  You should also grab a buckler if you find one (eventually once you have some experience to spare you'll want a shield and then a large shield - formicids get reduced shield skill requirements like large races). Just train your polearms for a bit.  Once your offense is in good shape, switch to defenses - I'd recommend training armour and putting on something heavy.  You're not casting spells or stabbing at the moment and you've got pretty high strength, so you really have no reason to be wearing a robe and training dodging instead of wearing something heavier and training armour.  The general guideline for skill training in DCSS is to train your offensive skills (weapon skill or main magic skills, usually) first until you're killing things nice and quickly, then switch to defensive skills (fighting, dodging, armour, shields) until you need more offensive power, sprinkling in utility skills (other magic schools, evocations, invocations, stealth, etc) as appropriate depending on your character. Drop the potion of poison.  Potions of poison have literally no positive use ever except for taking longer to commit suicide than Ctrl+Q.  (There used to be a spell that made them useful, but it's gone)."
dcss,2y7l0o,Quazifuji,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"awesome advice. just what I was looking for! thanks a lot. I remember that spell from an older version. I used to like that... I can't remember the the name now, but you would heat up different potions and then throw them! those were the good ol days of crawl, weren't they. Hey, thanks a lot for your advice. I'll post an update when I implement some of these changes!"
dcss,2y7l0o,Quazifuji,3,Sat Mar 7 07:25:47 2015 UTC,"I believe it was Evaporate.  The devs didn't like encouraging people to hoard bad potions, though, and it has some balance issues (stupidly strong with some types of potions), so they scrapped it."
dcss,2y7l0o,pereza0,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:22:37 2015 UTC,"I would say Chei is pretty suicidal for a Formicid.  As a Chei worshipper Teleport is THE escape option. Those cursed rings of teleportation that are a bother for any other character are a godsend for them.  Not having that... sucks. Step from time is useful but often unreliable and takes a lot of mana.  Formicids also generally have decent stats, so they don't benefit as much from stat boost as other race with worse ones.  As for Gods, I would also recommend Dithmenos. Shadow mimic improves your offense in general, stealth is good to avoid getting intro trouble in the first place and Shadow Form is an incredibly strong panic button."
dcss,2y7l0o,Quazifuji,1 point,Sat Mar 7 11:00:09 2015 UTC,"I've won with a FoFi of Chei, so I can say it's definitely doable, but it is a challenge.  It requires very careful positioning and good use of did and Chei's abilities.  I did come very, very close to getting killed a couple times, and it was by far the hardest orb run I've ever done, though (ice fiend and brimstone fiend showed up at the end of the screen and had me at 50 health almost immediately)."
dcss,2y7l0o,pereza0,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I don't think Fo of Chei is impossible or anything. Its just that even though it is a quite strong combo (basically anything of Chei is, and formicids get two handed weapons with large shields on top of that) it is just that the room for error is basically zero, even if your character is quite powerful to compensate.  A player that is new to Formicids like OP will already probably make a serious amount of mistakes with that race before they can get going. If you add Chei into the mix it will only be worse.  So yeah. I would recommend it as a strong but challenging combo for someone looking for something different, but not for someone trying to get into formicids for the first time."
dcss,2y7l0o,Quazifuji,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would call anything of Chei a strong combo.  Chei is widely considered the worst god by experienced players.  Chei and Xom are probably the only gods that qualify as challenge gods.  Fo of Chei somehow manages to be better than it has any right to be, but there is a reason I basically dedicated an entire paragraph to explain why it's particularly tricky despite giving Formicids an extra escape and the loss of haste not mattering."
dcss,2y7l0o,triorph,3,Sun Mar 8 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"Well if you're not using UC (and its a good idea not to on formicid) then you should trade that robe for the biggest piece of armour you can find, trade that spear for the biggest piece of weaponry you can find (I personally like the M&F school for this, great maces are awesome, but glaive/bardiche is what you're looking for with polearms). Invest pretty heavily in your weapon skill, with quite a bit in your fighting, armour, shields and dodging.   At some point choose a god. I see you're on 0.14.2, but if you were on latest I would recommend Ru. She makes you suffer strict conduct sacrifices but gives you abilities which greatly help with Formicid's main weakness (escape).   Make liberal use of kill-holes (diagonal zig-zag patterns dug into rock, allow you to fight one on one with any enemy)"
dcss,2y7l0o,Quazifuji,2,Sat Mar 7 04:18:51 2015 UTC,"thanks those all seem like great tips. I plan on making him a fighter, I guess that much is obvious. Should I look into getting a little magic going to aid me lack of escape options?"
dcss,2y77a8,useeikick,6,Sat Mar 7 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"Dex is all about EV, and Int is all about casting spells. The easiest way to decide this is to note your AC and EV scores and (if any) your spell failure chances with and without the hauberk. Then compare the two and decide which is better. If you're not casting spells, just go for the better sum of AC+EV, favouring a balance if the difference is very small (so 35 AC + 25 EV would be a little nicer than 45 AC + 15 EV for example)."
dcss,2y77a8,WinterShine,2,Sat Mar 7 01:58:17 2015 UTC,Without any more info I would say Yes.

You can treat it as a +18 chain mail with your aux slots filled with +2 stuff. 35 AC + cloaks is nothing to sneeze at. I think a HOFi will have enough strength to get 1-3rd level spells castable without those Int items."
dcss,2y77a8,Sharkman1231,2,Sat Mar 7 03:00:32 2015 UTC,what sort of spells do you get on a melee at a point in the game where having chainmail GDR is still useful O_O?
dcss,2y77a8,raukolith,3,Sat Mar 7 04:21:30 2015 UTC,"GDR should really be ignored as any kind of relevant concept, unless you play high-EV melee in robes (spriggan/Octopode).  And further down, in which situation is blink useful? You walk around a corner, and an ogre stands there, adjacent to you. You are not sure if your char is good enough to not die to it. Instead of walking away, pillardancing until a space randomly opens up between you, you cast blink and have high chance to be at least one space, probably even more away. This goes doubly against hydra/death yaks, where your escape options are rather limited. Or shadow traps in corridor, you are suddenly surrounded by heaps of slime creatures, which are going to fuse into titanic slime and kill even a BE."
dcss,2y77a8,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Sat Mar 7 11:44:21 2015 UTC,"Spells that are useful literally the entire game, for almost all characters. Animate Skeleton, Apportation, Blink, Conjure Flame, Regeneration, Repel Missiles, Spectral Weapon (maybe, this spell has been growing on me lately), Swiftness, Flight, Abjuration, Summon Butterflies, Stoneskin. These are all level 1-3 that are useful on many, many characters. Depending on your STR and INT, sticky flame and phase shift are really good for melee fighters."
dcss,2y77a8,Sharkman1231,2,Sat Mar 7 04:47:11 2015 UTC,hmm maybe i should stop playing berserkers... but i feel like i can't really spare experience to get these spells up while wearing armor. maybe i'm doing it wrong but i've never played a melee where i felt like having uncontrolled blink would be useful. actually i've never found uncontrolled blink useful at all. i might be positioning awfully though. i generally just fight in a choke with 100 guys behind the one dude instead of drawing them away one at a time because im incredibly lazy
dcss,2y77a8,raukolith,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:51:37 2015 UTC,"Those spells are useful later on, towards the lair branches once you (should) have enough exp to be safely killing dudes and not getting killed by dudes. Unless you're a minotaur you should be able to get enough XP to turn a couple of those on by the end of D:13-14 and Lair:8  Also a single uncontrolled blink is either worthless or amazing. Being able to spam 4-5 uncontrolled blinks (at most, usually 2 or 3 will do it) generally lets you put space so you can run up stairs. You can also position yourself so that the blinks are more likely to put you in a desirable location (rounding corners to minimize LOS, scrolls of fog and walking to force a direction).   In the situation you described, where there's a ton of dudes in a hallway, if you need to run you can just blink since all spaces down the hallway where the dudes are can't be blinked to. Blink is extremely solid. Waiting to blink until your LOS is minimized is extremely powerful. In places like the Shoals, Swamps, or Spider Nest (open areas with fast enemies) Blink isn't very good, but in the Vaults (where you can close doors) or the depths/Certain Zot layouts (hordes of medium strength enemies that will clog the narrow hallways) Blink is a lifesaver."

It can be extremely good if you're using a polearm, but I've found it's just to tasty of a target for your enemies. In narrow hallways it does nothing (unless polearms) and worthless in open areas. Around corners it's extremely good, but I'm still not quite sold on it. Every other spell you mentioned pulls their weight immensely."

He also is given to grandiose speeches and phrases, some of which get away from him or don't sound like he expected. The Monarch has admitted, only to #21, that sometimes he hates himself more than other villains hate their arch-nemeses. Despite his wealth, power, beautiful wife, and loyal henchmen, he seems eternally insecure and self-loathing. The reasons for this have yet to be explained. The Monarch can be witty and charming, and possesses a cutting sarcastic wit. Unfortunately these traits tend to emerge right before he does something very unwise.

dcss,2y679d,AngusOReily,2,Sun Mar 8 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"Nice run. I would argue your vamp weapon isn't that good. Flails have low-ish base damage, and vamp is quite useful early to mid game but toward the end I would go for a brand that does more damage. For a 1 hand mace user eveningstar (15) or morningstar (13) are ideal. With trog all game I have to imagine there were a lot more maces he gifted you. I usually go 2 handers though as I feel like heavy armour users have enough defense without needing a shield. Also being a minotaur I usually put a few points into Unarmed for auxiliary headbutts outside of just the counter-attack ones.  I'd also argue for a new player axes should be your go to -- they're just better than other melee weapons (except for Ogres who can use giant spiked clubs). Cleaving is super useful in open environment levels."
dcss,2y679d,gopack123,3,Fri Mar 6 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I used the demon whip throughout most the game as I read it's one of the best 1h flail dmg. When I first started playing the game I was MiBe and I used axes and definitely know the impact they can make. With this guy I wanted to just be overly tanky and force myself to position well and take out enemies quick 1v1. I definitely got a lot of maces, but wasn't sure which was best so I rarely picked them up and just stuck with the whip. I had a ton of enchant scrolls and it was +9 pretty early.  I didn't know that about Unarmed working with headbutts? Does the skill increase the riposte chance? That'd be sweet."
dcss,2y679d,gopack123,-3,Fri Mar 6 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"Actually what UC skill will do is when you swing a regular weapon, there's a chance you will headbutt as well. Or kick, or punch, or some other stuff depending on how many hands are full / mutations etc.  Demon whips are good too, they swing faster at max speed than other 1 handed maces which is nice. I don't know if you saw any Brand Weapon scrolls but I would have tried to use one on that demon whip of venom to get flaming, freezing, or elec, so that you have something for when enemies are immune to draining, which a lot of late game enemies are like Liches, demons etc. Those same enemies are immune to vamp also."

dcss,2y5qse,mdw,3,Fri Mar 6 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"I would say as a rule whenever there is an enemy that hits you for 1/5 of your total health that you should immediately be running from the situation. You already had a low hitpoint warning when you chose to stay in the line of sight of a yaktaur captain and were directly adjacent to a fire giant. Instead of fleeing via blinking, digging or tele you chose to stay and fight...  The squishiness of an octopode increases the need for a defensive tactic/strategy. You hadn't gained a single level in fighting to increase your hp, however you did have a decent amount of dodging and your shield was close to being used without penalties.  However to get that far with an octopode I'd have to say you were undoubtedly doing something right so keep at it and good luck!"

In this situation I thought that the main danger is the fire giant, whom I could quickly dispatch with my uber-bolts of cold. (I actually 2-shot him). What I totally underestimated was how much damage a yaktaur captain would do with his bolts of penetration. I was previously facing naga sharphooters at total leisure, they weren't able to do much damage before getting killed. I have no idea why are yaktaurs so much better at their ranged combat. Or were bolts of penetration piercing my shield?   You hadn't gained a single level in fighting to increase your hp   Everything is a thing of compromises. I had no use for melee combat so I primarily focused on getting dodging and shields. If I got some fighting, I'd totally had no advantage, because that yaktaur captain was doing ~40 dmg with each bolt. Clearly, little more HP wouldn't have saved me here.   However to get that far with an octopode I'd have to say you were undoubtedly doing something right so keep at it   This is the thing that is not working. I can get extremely powerful OpCj going and I still get wrecked eventually."
dcss,2y5qse,WinterShine,5,Fri Mar 6 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"In this situation I thought that the main danger is the fire giant, whom I could quickly dispatch with my uber-bolts of cold. (I actually 2-shot him). What I totally underestimated was how much damage a yaktaur captain would do with his bolts of penetration.   That's probably the key point there; you underestimated how much danger you were in. You needed to retreat sooner. Recognizing danger before it's too late is probably one of the most key skills in the game. You have to play more ""cowardly.""  Think of it this way. Every time you decide to go toe-to-toe with something that might kill you if you don't kill it first, you're giving yourself a chance to be killed. If you do this multiple times a run, then your odds of surviving every instance become very small. If on the average run you take on 10 enemies that you have an 80% chance of surviving, then your odds of surviving all ten are under 11%. So, to the greatest extent possible, you want to avoid any fights you're not sure to win.  And regardless of whether having more HP would have helped in this situation (it could have given you the time needed to teleport rather than blink, if you did so very early, for instance), it's still important to have just so that you're not getting 2-shot or 3-shot. You need to be able to survive long enough to make a getaway. You didn't need to have bolt of cold, iron shot, and OOD, and also nearly 10 Evoc online all before training some Fighting. Any one of those three would've sufficed, then get your defences up.  I tend to do 10 into Dodging or Armour, then 10 into Fighting, and then go back to more Dodging/Armour if I still want defence. The problem with pure dodging is that when you do get hit, you get hit badly. Whether I'm meleeing has little to do with the decision for me, at least up to that point.  As for healing potions/wands, yeah, they're not very good when you're still in danger. They are useful if you're waiting on a teleport, if you're in a dangerous place but not actively in a fight (example: on low HP in the Abyss with no monsters in sight), and of course you can burn them to cure rotted HP. They're much more powerful early game of course. If you really wanted to fight this, having !agility quaffed earlier would be more help. Either ?summoning or maybe ?fear might have helped too, can't remember what yaktaur captain MR is.   Do you always go Vehumet? You might be better off trying a god with emergency buttons (ex: Dith, Zin), allies you can use to support you (ex: Yre, Makhleb, Kiku). Then just get used to using them (or whatever else) to walk away from fights that aren't sure victories."
dcss,2y5qse,Disnof,3,Fri Mar 6 19:52:05 2015 UTC,"No char can get by without training fighting, that is kinda crazy.. I would train fighting over dodging."
dcss,2y5qse,DicemanCometh,2,Fri Mar 6 20:58:18 2015 UTC,Especially with only 100 hit points. That's one shot from crystal spear or two iron shots.
dcss,2y5qse,Seraphtheol,2,Sat Mar 7 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a series of tradeoffs, but raising fighting for some extra HP is extremely important. Looking at your character's skills, you probably should have just stuck with a buckler and started training fighting instead. While your shield is pretty decent, getting to 15 shields skill is a lot, and you've already also invested quite a bit in dodging.  Another thing is that you had rC+++ but no rF. I don't know what you found in the dungeon but I would have reduced myself to rC++ or even rC+ in favor of at least a single pip in rF.   Also if you had found it, repel missiles is an easy to cast spell that helps immensely against archers."
dcss,2y5qse,pereza0,2,Fri Mar 6 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"You need to emphasize defense a bit more. Low skill levels are really cheap (check the wiki) you wont be sacrificing your offenses by improving them.  Fighting is important. Repel Missiles would work great since it was ranged that killed you.   Charms can also get you haste, which serves both as a escape tool and increase the rate at which you cast spells. Ozocubus Armour can compensate for the lack of AC too. Also the battleorb thing. Also, translocations  With characters with low AC you can never truly relax, yes, 90% of stuff never touches you but if two 10% hits you in a row you are in for some bad times. So you need to develop alternate ways to defend yourself and panic buttons thqt dont involve putting on the biggest piece of shit you can find"

Low skill levels are really cheap (check the wiki) you wont be sacrificing your offenses by improving them.   Love this. At EV/SH 26/17 I get advice about improving my defence. I repeat, few points of HP wouldn't have saved me, the second hit from the yaktaur had me at something like -30 HP. That would take some 10+ points in Fighting skill to just offset that I would need to take from some other skill (yes, that Evoc is probably something I could spare, but that Evoc was trained to give me some extra panic button)."
dcss,2y5qse,DicemanCometh,7,Fri Mar 6 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well apparently  those defences were not good enough against a mere yakataur captain?  You know, most people here are writing advice here because you asked for it. They probably took the time to look at your morgue and see how your character could have done better. It would probably be more productive to you to try to let this advice sink (and hey! maybe even be thankful they took the time to do so - even if you dont completely agree)  in rather than try to argue or whatever you are trying to accomplish here.  It is true that training fighting would probably not have saved you here, but it is still generally a good idea to train it. Again, the lower skill levels are really cheap, if you are uncomfortable training it too high, leave it lower. But try not to get used to leave it at zero, rather, make it a half or  third of your main skill  Try to be a bit more versatile with spells, yes, you are a conjurer - but if you have too many conjurations their roles start overlapping. Good you had Condensation Shield though.  And don't sweat it too much, Octopodes are complicated. If you are willing to try, I would advise you give Tengu a shot.

Archers and giants will just wreak you all day long without one of these spells, even with a shield...  Also, Op are very weak and are hard to play. I can get 15 rune with a DeCj, but I would be lucky to get past lair on OpCj. IMO the only place Op shine is if your doing extended Zig runs and can manage to get 6+ arty rings. I would suggest playing difference races until you can do 6-15 run runes.  One last note, caster and melee chars have harder times in certain areas. I would have done everything possible before vaults as a caster Elf, Slime(provided you have mut and/or corr resist), and a few levels of the depths. This is because there are many ranged mobs in the vaults and also they can trap you in rooms making escape impossible if you run out of mana. Not to mention the cluster F that is Vault 5."
dcss,2y5qse,indspenceable,2,Fri Mar 6 20:33:52 2015 UTC,This is correct. Mages survive with utility spells. Repel/Deflect missiles is the most important spell in the game imo. Yak Captains and Stone Giants will kill you in 2 turns without it.

Well, in the Snake full of naga sharpshooters I had no trouble at all, so I wasn't expecting yaktaurs would be that much worse.  At any rate, I think I'm rather conversant with OpCj. If I don't get randomly wrecked by something before Lair, I can usually do Lair and Orc fine. One bad thing is how chance some basic octopode equipment is. You can go for thousands of turns without ever seeing a buckler or a hat, not to speak of not getting some vital spells (like Repel Missiles)."
dcss,2y5qse,DicemanCometh,2,Sat Mar 7 07:44:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the naga sharpshooters were doing no damage because of your shield was blocking their arrows. Mobs that have higher pierce values will shoot right through that 17 sh. Notably stone giants and Yaktaur capts. Also, the bolt of pen may be doing it too, not sure. At that point you need to rely on repel/deflect missile, AC, HP, summons, or just raw DPS. My fav summon is battle sphere it is a champ. It will move to block arrows, taking the dmg for you."

I'd say some other underrated spells are the new offensive translocations, just because no magic background is really translocation focused. (Warpers are more melee or throwing based than pure caster)  Gell's Gravitas is ridiculously funny to cast, and singularity (no wiki article for it yet) is just as nasty as any top tier elemental spell.  edit: it seems corpses cant be picked up anymore, which means they can't be thrown or portal projectiled. This limits corpse rots offensive uses."

It's basically a clone of your weapon that attacks whenever you attack, so potentially almost doubling your damage.  The downside is that it doesn't inherit slaying/might etc from you and whenever it gets hurt you it does half the damage to you, which means it can be a liability against monsters with heavy aoe.   Still, if you have a good weapon and can position is so that you can both attack and it doesn't take too much damage it's devastating. this means polearms are particularly good for the spell. I finished a 15 rune run yesterday as a MfSk and spectral weapon + haste with a +9 trishula let me take out even the tanks like Cerebov and Antaeus ridiculously quickly (I was 'lucky' in that I turned a corner to find myself next to Cerebov otherwise his firestorms would have probably meant I couldn't use spectral weapon)."

Going crossbows and something like axes is nice, because then you can just buff strength and be set there.  You'll want to conserve ammo early with crossbows, and melee most things.  With Ru you think of your bow as your 'special attack' option - most things will be easy to melee, but when you run into those really hard things thats when you bust out the crossbow, with which you'll have plenty of ammo to kill things with.  If you go the crossbow route, focus on bow/melee, with secondary in fighting/armor (you'll get to wear nice heavy armor, so dodging isn't really worth training).  If you get nice evocables train that up a bit too.  The one thing with this strategy, is that its really hard to do any endgame stuff due to your sacrifices.

dcss,2xrpmg,Vlasow,7,Tue Mar 3 08:40:13 2015 UTC,"I usually keep stealth around 1/3 to 1/2 of the level of my primary offensive skills on a spellcaster and most of the time creatures that sleep do not wake as I enter LOS giving me a chance to step back out of range or initiate the fight on my terms.  Once I get my core set of spells memorized and castable at negligible failure rates XP distribution becomes all about gaining extra edges on survivability.  Once you have your spellcasting skills sorted out, the main considerations are typically dodging, armour, shields, fighting, a weapon skill, and stealth for XP investment.  I personally rate stealth 2nd after dodging in that list (assuming you have the minimum shields skill for your shield) so in a game that goes into extended I typically max stealth out on pure/near pure spellcasters.    I'll run down my reasoning for you.   Spellcasters are frontloaded offensively, capable of great bursts of power, but obviously limited by MP.  Having the initiative in a fight has great synergy when you can start off by disabling or decimating the threat before it has a chance to cast a disabling or hugely damaging spell, fire a ranged shot, leaping attack/blink onto you, torment, smite, hellfire, drain your mp, malmutate, banish or otherwise complicate your situation or deal you lasting harm. Most spellcasters have low hp.  Having the initiative prevents your enemy from having the initiative and surprising you with a big hp hit, putting you on the backfoot immediately. Some enemies are much faster than you, at least before you get Haste, and some are still faster even with Haste.  Stealth greatly reduces the chance that you simply get run down by an enemy that is too fast and too resistant to your spells.   Spellcasters typically wear robes or light armor and take little to no penalty to stealth. Spellcasters often have summons or confusion causing spells that can allow enemies to be caught off guard for a stabbing attack.  The damage boost from stealth on melee attacks is a valuable way to conserve MP while still quickly dealing with low to moderately threatening enemies.  Particularly before you get efficient aoe spells or quality summons.  Combined with Vehumet it also enhances your ability to recover MP during fights and in desperate situations, albeit slightly. Most of the races typically played as casters have above average stealth aptitude.   Spellcasters can be caught with their pants down, low on mana, resting.  If you have stealth, wandering enemies will often not detect you immediately, giving you a chance to move back out of LOS and avoid agro.   Stealth seems to have a low xp requirement compared to core skills like spellcasting and fighting.  I haven't rummaged through the code to fight out exactly what the difference is, but I think it's significantly less costly than most other skills."

However, once you extend beyond that, Stealth becomes vital for a spellcaster IMHO. The things that can actually be dangerous then (hellfire, Pan lords, wretched stars, starcursed masses...) can take out a frail spellcaster very quickly. Killing them or thinning out their entourage or limiting their abilities is often possible within a round of encountering them, though, as a high-level spellcaster is very adept at dishing out huge damage just as quickly as they die.  So surprising them, getting yourself into a good position and throwing two or three firestorms before they can even do anything - that's what Stealth is good for. And running away, of course. For the latter, it's also great throughout the game, but I usually go for very light armor and stealth-improving items in that regard."

dcss,2xrgsm,I_Probably_Think,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's always been that way?  Some set percentage to draw from the deck of wonders instead (i think), which includes Focus"
dcss,2xrgsm,WinterShine,8,Tue Mar 3 07:32:18 2015 UTC,"It's Deck of Oddities. 1% of all cards generated come from that deck instead, which has seven cards:  Wrath, Xom, Feast, Famine, Curse, Helix, Focus. I'm not sure whether the distribution on those seven is uniform or not.  If you were playing a non-berserker troll, you'd have to have that 1% happen and be followed by getting Focus from the deck of oddities at least 4 times in one game. If we assume the odds of getting Focus from the deck of oddities is 1/7, then you have about a 24% chance of drawing Focus at least once per thousand cards drawn.  The odds of pulling at least 4 Focus cards per thousand would be about 5.7%. So basically, you rolled a crit fail on your Nemelex save. It drops to ~1.5% for 5 Focus cards per thousand and about 0.35% for six per thousand, so if your troll is anything other than a Fighter or Gladiator (or Berserker), then it's likely a total non-issue. Same if you burn a couple stat gains into Int, which might be nice for brain worms anyway.  Incidentally, my SpAr^Nem win used either Draw One or Evoke Deck a total of 291 times, so 1000 should be a huge overestimate for a 3 rune game (and that was with old Nemelex). Assuming again 1% chance to pull from Oddities and 1/7 chance of Focus per pull, the odds of pulling Focus at least four times in 300 draws would be less than 0.1%.  Seems like you just got super unlucky."

Should have left the thing earlier; 17 was Mummies, I messed up my careful draw one out at a time approach (still not sure how: it was a large floor) and thus met my expectable doom.  Anywho, I didn't notice that at all, going by my approach. If you're blind drawing a lot I guess it might happen, though. You could also play a race that's less susceptible to stat loss, so that Focus will actually be a positive thing (since it will make your character more, you know, focused)."

Those are the closest to early game magic casting a full tank build can get.Other alternatives such as invocations with gods that offer spells or Nemelex are also possible,albeit they're less like casting specific spells and more like casting catch-all,killdudes/killdudes with buffs or escape stuff,with a few exceptions.

Also, as a Draconian you really don't get any disadvantages from mixing magic with melee. And your defenses will never get to the point you can just tab carelessly. You had 7 spell levels left, but all the spells you had learned were buffs (other than Airstrike) - you could have thrown in some offensive air conjurations too to soften up enemies before you go ahead and hit them. Airstrike is great against weaklings like boggarts and the like, but you can use something with a bit more punch for other things  If you want to try something around similar lines, try TeCj or TeAE, you have insane aptitudes for Air Magic and Conjurations and you are good with weapons too. The catch is that your HP is kinda bad.  Also, from me, this week:  Crypt is usually a cakewalk for all my characters, so I went with my VpEn there for some easy loot...

While not nearly as powerful as stabbing sleeping/paralyzed enemies, you still get a damage bonus if you attack an enemy which is focused on one of your allies.  Of course, this involves either starting as a stabber and finding a summoning book (or worshipping Kiku), or starting as a summoner and training into stabbing later.

You were running around with rC+++ and no rF (the rF+ you had in the morgue was from the dragonskin cloak). The thing is, fire is more common than cold and also hurts more (see orbs of fire), and, most importantly, fireball can't be evaded, so your huge 50 EV counts for nothing. This makes orbs of fire perhaps your character's worst enemy, so it's unsurprising that you died to one, even if the more direct cause may have been carelessness."

Not that big of a hit to stealth, and good protection/utility. troll,mottled are good choices, good ring mail as well, would not go much higher than encumbrance 6-7 or so.  2) It makes you invisible, but also halves your damage, so stabbing not always works out that well. Its good to ninja runes, as emergeny button- not when you are at 20  health, but when you are at 50- and gives torment immunity! Makes it possible to steal the tomb-rune.  3) Stabbing is a lot easier if you have invisibilty. You can get spider/swamp/shoals rune with invisibilty, and normal level elves as well (not the E:3 vault).  As for your dump: get short blades to 10, search for ""short blade&&brand"" and see if you have some better weapon lying around. I like to get SB to 12 and spend my first acq? on weapon, which gives most of the time a quick blade.   You have enslave, and still all of lair/orc, so you are fine right now?

Crypt was fairly easy to deal with it. Even though Crypt has really low ambient noise and you'd think that'd be super rough with enemies noticing you easier due to Ash, it was still very manageable as I was careful when I used my LRD. The depths pretty much sucked. Hat of the Alchemist let me handle some of the nastier elemental threats in Frost and Fire giants, but Trolls were the worst. Troll shamans were really scary when they buffed a group of Deep Trolls, and Troll Earth mages were a nightmare because they would dig massive chunks of floor making it easier to be found and they would LRD me.

Some people like to level only one skill at a time, but you have to be very vigilant on stopping at the right point, and knowing when that right point is. I personally like to level a few at once.

Defences are second, and should be trained when you're good enough at killing dudes. Most other things like magic should only be trained if you can afford to ignore your killdudes and defence skills for a while.  Invocations (or whatever your god uses) is an exception. You should always train it enough that you can use all the abilities your god currently gives you access to. Don't bother training it more until later in the game (if you have a god whose powers get stronger when you train it).  Fighting is mostly about the HP boost, though it does give melee accuracy. Since the HP bonus is based on your level, it's not very good early on, so you usually train it after some other defence (armour or dodging).  Training a weapon past the skill needed to reach its minimum delay gives a lot less than training it up to that point, so it's usually best not to rain past that unless you've xp to spare. You don't need to mindelay your weapon immediately, but having it under 1.0 delay will (mostly) prevent enemies from swinging twice in a row against you."

Getting a holy branded executioner's might be tricky, even with Trog/Oka.  You could of course worship TSO and get him to brand your executioner's, but that seems a lot of work and not worth it if you only plan to switch for the brand."
dcss,2x56hn,Eptagon,1 point,Thu Feb 26 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"That's a mace though, and OP doesn't likely want to be switching weapon types at this point. Sacred scourges are quite rare, and generally only acquired by having TSO bless a demon whip. Occasionally if you encounter an angelic sort of enemy they might drop one, I believe.  Also, if we're talking regular game and not extended, I'd say that most of the major threats aren't even undead or demons. There are ancient liches of course, but the scourge won't do much to, say, draconians or orbs of fire, most major stuff in Vaults, etc. I'm not sure it'd be worth training Maces up, even to merely 12, for such a situational item. Maybe if doing extended (but then OP might want to bail on Trog for TSO after all, and you can bless the exec axe -- I assume with OP's weapon luck, it must be a Trog game)."
dcss,2x56hn,WinterShine,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"Of course, I'm not advocating he should actually look for a scourge. It would be reasonable to use one (for undead/demonic/chaotic/evil branches) if he found it, though, assuming he doesn't want to switch to TSO and does want to do extended. If either of the conditions isn't true or if he doesn't find a scourge, all of this is moot.  Can Trog grant holy weapons, by the way? I assume he can, but I'm not sure it's even possible."

Overall by looking at the combat log I could see that the shield blocks a ridiculous amount of attacks, and I would rather block ten thousand attacks in a game than gain 10% more damage by wielding a two handed weapon.

Incorrect, if you paid attention I carried a +9 sacred scourge with me, I also had a +9 exec axe, both of them are not on par with a broad axe. With str and dex as high as mine, the average effective damage of a broad axe is only a tiny bit lower than i.e. a +9 triple sword, i.e. 34.5 with a broad axe vs an executioner vs 39 with a triple sword (but you lose a shield and can only hit one enemy at a time). If you're hitting more than one enemy at all, no weapon is on par with axes. The cleave and shields don't synergize well comment is inane, the pierce value on every block does not increase much, you will still block most of the attacks (50%+) before they have to pass an AC and EV check.   Also, if you're in extended, shields do nothing against most of the actual threats (torment, hellfire, panlords spamming L9 spells)   I literally mentioned that in the post 'the only danger in the game is torment and hellfire, everything else is completely irrelevant and can be safely ignored', and 73 AC is not clouding anything, if you can safely ignore every melee enemy and just walk up to a pan lord and kill him in 5 turns while automatically healing yourself by killing everyone around you, then you're set for the game. Also AC does prevent damage from spells.   which are better dealt with by hitting them with the biggest weapon you can possibly wield   Also incorrect, a simple sacred scourge has a higher effective damage than the 'big weapons' that require two hands. A +9 sacred scourge with no brand at all will have 47 average effective damage vs a hellion, a +9 triple sword will have just 43.5, if you hadd a holy wrath brand to the triple sword and sacred scourge they will have 74.3 and 75.9 aveff dam, not only dose the one handed scourge do more damage, you get to use a shield... Obviously against high AC enemies (Cerebov) the triple sword will do a bit more damage (~10%), but only against high AC enemies, and it's still not worth it to lose the shield.   There are other things that could be said to bring your ego back to Earth - for example, you won't get anywhere close to 73 AC every game   That's true, but you must realize, people don't post their 500 characters that died, they post the one that made it.

Giving everyone who has ever contributed to the game proper credit and a fair cut would be borderline impossible.  It doesn't significantly help the game move forward. This is a hobby project for most developers, they have day jobs elsewhere - budget is not the problem here.  If you want to give something back, try to contribute to the game somehow (it is open source remember). You don't necessarily need to know how to write code. If you are good at drawing you can make tiles, if you are good at writing you can do descriptions or translate and you can also play the development version to keep an eye out for any bugs to squash - you could also make some vaults. If you have the time, skill and patience you could even make a major feature for the game and see if it gets accepted!"

dcss,2x0lhl,inchmeat,8,Tue Feb 24 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Earlier versions of crawl had a item weights/burdening system that depended on STR.  So, having a minimum STR was required to carry around stuff.  It's still reasonable to go up to about 8 STR, if you plan to wear some good armor (FDA, QDA, maybe even PDA). Up until about the EV penalty of the armor, STR is a very good investment.  By the way, the guides on the wiki tend to be obsolete and, in general, not such excellent advice. You're better off figuring out how to play in general, without shoehorning yourself in a specific build. E.g. the DE guide assumes you always want to worship Vehu, because that reduces variance, but it's usually better to pick the first, among a number of effective gods, you find. You can ask people on here, I'm sure they can tell you a lot of stuff about DEs that the wiki doesn't touch."

dcss,2x0lhl,Weeksy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:31:28 2015 UTC,"The guides are all personal opinion pieces, many of them poor advice. People can get very angry when other players update their guide with opinions the guidemaker disagrees with, so each guide is only ever written/updated by one person, often someone who no longer plays the game, has forgotten about their guide, and/or is just terrible.  There are a few decent guides out there, but even they need to be taken with a grain of salt and viewed through the 'this advice might not be up to date' looking glass.  Part of the reason it is hard to have a good guide in crawl is that the best way to play crawl is to adapt to what you find, be it spellbooks, early altars, powerful items, etc. Trying to do one specific thing every time will leave you with a lot of missed opportunities and less-than-ideal situations.   Learning good tactics, learning how to identify good weapons and spells, learning when to switch strategies, learning that most gods are viable for most characters (and more importantly, when a god isn't viable for a character), and learning how not to die of hubris (something I still haven't done) are I think the most important things to figure out in crawl.   For this reason, the best guides either leave lots of room for people to adapt to these things, or even better, will teach players some of these things. I think my favorite example of this is How to MiBe by Psieye, because it talks about positioning and tactics, and so is general advice about how to play crawl, not just a list of skills to train."

You also will never be able to draw cards without identifying the next card in fear of drawing Focus which will lower your str even farther."

Is there any other benefit of strength besides attack power?"

Not only are the out of date, but even when they were in date they weren't very good, often written by people who fluked a few wins. In reality the entire idea of a guide is opposed to the playstyle required to be good, where you have to adapt to what the dungeon gives you instead of following a prepared plan.  That said, this guide is very good, avoiding those pitfalls and being good for most character types: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=12062&p=168952&hilit=friend#p168952"

dcss,2wx22b,Ijyb,2,Mon Feb 23 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"Looking at your chardump,  you are yet to start the depths. You should do depths completely before you try V:5.  Look for swamp or mottled dragon hide to enchant. Also look for other staves: conjuration, fire, earth. Use the energy staff as a weapon swap to channel after fights.  There are a lot of spells you should forget: magic dart; call imp; throw flame; bolt of magma; repel missiles. This will free up spell slots as well as make your spellforged servitor stronger.  Train to about level 5 in air for deflect missiles, then maybe one more level of charms for a lower failrate haste. Learn bolt of fire if you have it, and/or fireball. Then go straight into training dodging to about 18 and fighting to at least 10.  It looks like your main damage dealing spell is iron shot, with LCS for dangerous enemies. This is an OK setup, but not a typical choice with the high elf earth aptitude of -2. Still, with a solid aoe spell like fireball or bolt of fire and more earth skill, say 16, and a staff like earth or conjurations, you can certainly ascend with a powerful iron shot / LCS.  Is 6 bread all the food you have? If so, then there's been some serious food mismanagement going on. If not, you should carry all your food with you. Chop and eat more corpses.  Firestorm in V:5 is fun but actually one of the harder ways to do it. Much easier is teleporting (optional ctele) and getting to the outer edge, and slowly clearing  a quadrant with a quiet spell like iron shot / bolt of fire."

When you are ready, go to Vaults:4, haste yourself, quaff brilliance (if you have it), channel magic, go downstairs, blink out of the circle of guards (use a scroll, not the spell... or maybe jump with those boots) and Fire Storm them. Vehumet will restore your mana but you should supplement with channeling (pump more into evocations). Lure all of them away from the stairs.

dcss,2wx22b,kazak__,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:53:52 2015 UTC,"Well an alternate strategy would be to grab another pip of rfire, pull up whatever buffs you can manage (invis, haste, agility,  resistance, etc...), pop down the stairs,  read a scroll of immolation, then blast away a couple times.  This sets off a poor man's firestorm, taking out the welcoming party.   Then you stair dance for a bit as the now awake level rolls toward you, teleporting away when things get hairy,  then working around the edges.  Honestly,  though,  i wouldn't try either strategy at this point with your guy.   As the other comments mentioned,  defenses are weak,  probably in part due to the ring mail. I'd usually also pump fighting and stealth a bit.  Iron shot and crystal spear are a bit redundant.   I would've been happy with just iron shot and less skill levels in earth. Spellcasting is also probably overleveled.  I'd also look for a good AOE spell, like one of the clouds,  fireball,  lrd,  etc....    Basically,  you have your single target damage and your resists covered,  but that's about it.   At this point,  I'd dip into elf and depths to shore up my weaknesses, then finish vaults later.  With careful play Iron shot should do fine in both places,  though i tend to hold off on elf 3 until my MR is at 4 or 5 stars to avoid banishment."

dcss,2wvi0m,wizardofpancakes,4,Mon Feb 23 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"I tend to play DECj a lot and migrate toward fire spells with the goal of firestorm. Generally I focus the spell school(s) that feeds my damage spells and then go dodging and maybe shields if I've found a buckler and then finally get some fighting so I'm a bit less squishy. Then once my dodging (having EV around 20 makes me feel pretty safe) is good and I've got enough health (around 100 when I'm clearing lair) that I'm not going to get destroyed by a spiny frog I'll start to focus my damage dealing spell schools again usually conjurations and fire. I don't tend to focus training on spellcasting. Hunger from spells isn't really a problem in the early game since there are lots of corpses to eat and hopefully by late game I've got gourmand or a staff of energy to keep the machine going.  The best advice I've gotten as a caster is be sure to start to retreat once your MP is at 50% unless you're just mopping up. Since blasting fools is your main way to deal damage when the MP well goes dry you're pretty screwed. Sure you've probably got a dagger or something but that should be a last resort as you're heading to stairs or some other safe spot. Also, put some points into EVO for the eventuality that you run out of MP or get silenced. Evocables are super strong and can save you in a tight spot but you probably know that from your time w/ melee dudes.  As a transmuter I'd guess that you're going with blade hands? So probably focus the transmutation spell school till blade hands is at or less than 10% failure and then pump unarmed combat in the early game and probably switch to some dodging or armour once you're dicing dudes up comfortably and then back to beefing up your unarmed combat. I'll defer to those who play transmuters since I've not had any luck keeping them alive. :)"

As a transmuter, you'll likely want to worship Cheibriados and pump Dodging and Unarmed, and hold some Transmutations to make sure you don't fail much.  Learn Ozocubu's Armour and Condensation Shield, or the (all-beloved) alternative of Statue Form and Stoneskin (which gives tremendous defense, offense and resistances at the cost of your action speed and armor melding)  Edit:  Huh.  I should try Okawaru.  I can see also a good amount of synergy with ranged weapons - enter Blade Hands when you want to go in close combat, and use a good ol' triple crossbow when you want to mow things down while they're still at the edge of LOS.  Also, being able to use Finesse probably makes UC as powerful as with Chei."

But it was already going to be good enough, and Chei permanently gives you one of the worst debuffs in the game. Chei is far more likely to kill a character than save it, and should generally be considered hard mode, especially for new players.  The best rule of thumb with gods, that said, is to pick a decent one early, rather than hold out for the ideal one. The earlier one picks, the earlier your piety is high enough for it to help you out. Early Fedhas is amazing, and lots of other gods are solid regardless of build. Dith, Ru, Makhleb, Lugonu, Yre, Kiku, Nemelex, Qazlal, Zin maybe... all solid choices early (in no particular order).  For stat silliness without the slowdown, I wonder how TSO/Ely switching to Jiyva would play out for UC. (They don't get mad if you abandon unless you join an evil god.

With all that said, I have to defend my choice:  Playing as a Cheibriadite is both challenging and rewarding, and requires you to change tactics; it forces you to attain much higher defenses than you would with any other type of setup.  That being said, getting those defenses is very, very easy under Chei:  I recall my GrMo having 35 AC / 30 EV by mid-Lair, and my MfTm literally walking into the Elf:3 vault at around level 18 and splattering all the deep elves inside.  (Said Mf had Deflect Missiles and high-power statue form up by then, and was riding on enough EV to dodge a magic dart.)  Cheibriados lets you reach heights that would be otherwise impossible, at the cost of movespeed.  That's it!  Say about him what you want, but I've always found him pretty refreshing."

Consider it somewhat equivalent to mindelay for melee weapons. Once that's satisfactory, focus on something else like dodging. Switch back to your spell schools if there is something new you want to learn, and spellcasting if levels are needed.  Normally I see people overtrain spellcasting. Use amnesia scrolls and unneeded books to forget spells you no longer need. You can get by with training spellcasting very little if you manage your spell levels right, saving xp for other skills.

I find that hard to believe, and cursing your magic fully will give your spells a nice boost (and would have prevented overtraining charms, but no harm done). With invisibility you are free to dip into elf and get a buckler from there. If you are feeling lucky, you can also visit the hall of blades on elf:2 (Not sure if only in trunk, so it might not be there) and there just might be a quickblade. (have seen ones of pain, elec and distortion!) None of the weapons see invisibile, so its easy+safe.   Neither Spider or swamp endings are really prepared for invisible chars- there is one swamp ending that has spriggan druid, otherwise you are good to go.  Third rune, slime or abyss are really alright for a stealthy spriggan: slime, you need rcorr and repel/deflect missiles, you quaff agility, and try to stab the royal jelly. Failing that, you beat a retreat, and start pelting it with attack wands (you want to train evocation to 10-15 anyway, btw), read a scroll of immolation, and incinerate its gelatinous hordes and it.  Abyss: easy to do with ring of teleportation, if you want to be safe stay on abyss 3, I like to go down to abyss 5 for faster results. Fact is, most rune vaults in abyss are not prepared for invisible stabbers! And if you get one that seems dangerous, you just walk away until you get a second or third chance. Walk around, look out for sleeping monsters or regular structures, and pop Ashs scyring if you feel there might be a rune somewhere around, you get a lot of piety in abyss.  As for non-stabbable monsters, you still have a good way to go... But: mass confusion is good, gets 50% spellpower bonus over confusion. Shadow creatures is really really good, and has NO spellpower component, only success, and will give ridicoulous results in the deep end of the dungeon. Fight orbs of fire with golden dragons and other orbs of fire, cheap investment, safe bet. Otherwise itd would depend on what books you have. I like air on spriggans, due to single spell school and you also get silence/deflect missles, and tornado is fun as spriggan."

dcss,2wltgs,Fambida,5,Sat Feb 21 00:14:14 2015 UTC,"Early game don't train Translocations. Just memorize Blink and maybe Shroud, and they should have a reasonably low enough fail% to be usable even without training, especially on the armourless felid. You should mostly build this background exactly as you would a Fighter or Gladiator.  Your build right now is far too defensively focused. You have 5.7 fighting and 7.8 dodging, but a mere 5.0 UC. UC is your bread and butter skill, so you should train that, and only that, for quite a while. Getting it to about 11 is a good early goal -- UC gives 1 base damage every level, and reduces your attack delay by 1 every 5.4 levels, so 11 UC gives you +11 base damage and 0.8 attack speed. With paw claws that's a 16 base damage unbranded weapon (so it's similar to an unbranded +1 double sword, +1 battleaxe, or +1 glaive).  Usually at that point is when I'd start training some defences, and switch back to UC whenever my damage needs to be higher. Note that the HP bonus from Fighting scales with your XP level, so training it really early doesn't help a lot (though once you level up you still get the scaled up HP, you don't lose anything long-term by training early).  As for Invocations, early on in the game you should generally have enough Invo to keep your abilities usable, but don't worry about training it to make them more powerful. That can come later once you've got some XP to spare. UC is powerful, but will take a lot of your XP to keep up since you'll eventually want to hit 27 in it.  So summary, train like a melee character for the first long while. UC 11, then some defences, then UC ~16ish (16.2 = 0.7 delay) are good early goals, while keeping your Invo where it needs to be. After that you have some flexibility to pump a bit more Invo or defences or train level 3-4 spells, and do other things. Later on, when you can afford to waste a long time getting the XP, it might be worth training summoning, because Shadow Creatures and Monstrous Menagerie are actually quite good. They do somewhat duplicate what Makhleb does for you, of course, but trade strength in favour of being safer and spammable.  And do memorize Blink. Yes, it's random, but it can get you out of bad spots, and sometimes into good spots. If a Makhleb summon comes up hostile, it can be very nice to have. And if you spot a ranged enemy, you can blink and either move toward them (good for killing them) or away (good for positioning yourself so they have to come to you)."
dcss,2wltgs,WinterShine,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:06:40 2015 UTC,... Wow.  I'm inspired to give Wr a more serious about next tourney.  Awesome entry-level advice!
dcss,2wltgs,I_Probably_Think,2,Sat Feb 21 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"FeWr (and really any other very stealthy Wr) have one rather silly advantage: Passage of Golubria stabs.  Felids in this version have shortblade stabs in their UC, and there is no sound made when you arrive at your destination with PoG.  Thus, the spell can be used when spotting powerful monsters - see them resting, step back, set up a passage next to them, enter it, and BOOM HEADSHOT.  It's helped me take down multiple pan lords; hydras, deep elf blademasters, uniques... you name it.  In a more serious vein, though, Passage of Golubria is extremely useful to make escapes.  It has its pros and cons against cBlink, but it's certainly better than semi-cblink.  Pair the spell with Blink to get out of (and far away from) situations where you're surrounded; use it to more accurately get in (or out) of range with ranged monsters as you would have a Jump attack.  The spell doesn't need to be setup beforehand, but if it is, it can give you an extreme advantage against most monsters (especially ones that are faster than you).  Use it to create a failsafe stabbing method:  Set one passage towards your target and one away from it.  Enter it, then if your target wakes up, enter the passage you just exited from to get away from there.  Other than PoG, some extremely useful spells for Felids fighter/casters to aim for are Statue Form + Stoneskin, Discord, Singularity, Force Lance, cBlink, Malign Gateway (for those pesky things you don't wanna fight); Silence, Haste, RMsl / DMsl, etc.  Pick and choose based on what you get, and always train that UC."

But Ru also avoids giving sacrifices that would give you more piety than you need to ""max out"" at 160 (the maximum for Ru, exactly enough for ******, unlike the usual 200).  Because of this, significant sacrifices focused on your character are actually less likely to appear once your piety is near the maximum."

dcss,2wgfwx,DustAngel,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"The dire flail will do a bit more damage, I think (not a lot more damage, though), but the demon whip will heal you and let you use a shield.  A demon whip in general is a much better weapon than a dire flail, and vampiric is a very, very good brand as long as you're fighting living enemies, but that is a particularly strong dire flail.  Basically, in this case, the demon whip is an amazing defensive choice, while the dire flail is a solid offensive choice.  Your weapon and shields skills and whether you've found any good shields could also make a difference.  Also consider checking out that great mace.  Great maces are the best two-handed maces if you're not an ogre or troll, although I don't know exactly what brand/enchant one would need to outdamage that dire flail, and I don't know how much weapon skill you have (speaking of which, it's probably easier to just post your entire dump than a little excerpt of it, just in case there's something that people want to check out that you didn't think was relevant - in this case, M&F skill)."
dcss,2wgfwx,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks, someone told me once that demon whips are better to use for mace wielders than great maces, is that not true anymore?"
dcss,2wgfwx,Quazifuji,2,Thu Feb 19 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Demon whips are one of the best one-handed weapons in the game, while great maces are one of the best two-handed weapons.  For a character relying on their weapon as their main form of offense, the extra damage from a two-handed weapon is usually better than a shield, especially if you're wearing heavy armour and have most of you aux armour slots available.  But a good demon whip is still a very good weapon."
dcss,2wgfwx,triorph,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was ever true. Great maces are the best mace in the game (not including great spiked clubs that only ogres/trolls can use), and the only reason to use a demon whip over one is because its one handed, leaving the other hand for a shield or Ru sacrifice. Technically the demon whip requires less skill to get to min delay too.  Even with one handed weapons, an eveningstar is better most of the time, although rare enough that you may not find one in a game."

Deep Elf should work totally fine (be super aware of your squishiness though), and really any race without severe penalties to magic has a good shot.

dcss,2we0cd,I_Probably_Think,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"To make it as easy as possible in the beginning I'd say High Elf or Tengu because of their early boost to Air magic. The problem with Tengu is - they can't wear boots (and boot of speed are somewhat common later in this map), they also have 10% less health, although they will gain Air magic and Conjuration faster than a High Elf  which will boost early damage. Deep Elf should work fine for the 5 rune Zot run, but for the full extended 17/15 runes his -30% to health is a bit problematic."

For the parts of the game where it is better it is much better though. And even in the extended endgame being in lichform is only sometimes better than not - no ddoor, revifification, regeneration or potions, vulnerability to holy and dispel undead. Lots of XP to get it, still no protection from hellfire, if you stick with Kiku you have 40% torment resist anyway. You're not mentioning anything about wanting to do stupid channeling tricks - in fact you're talking about switching to Vehumet not Sif.

dcss,2w7r61,Fat_Adam,4,Tue Feb 17 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"Venom and Draining are great early game, but drop in value by mid-game. The drain debuff stacks better with a fast weapon, but the damage scales based on the weapon's base damage (and isn't great anyway), so unfortunately you can't get the best of both from it.  Flaming and Freezing are solid all game. Vorpal is a little weaker than either, but isn't affected by rF or rC. Most games (except with Trog) you'll probably finish with one of these three brands.  Vampiric is stellar everywhere that it works, which is most of a 3-rune game.  Speed is amazing, but except for lucky artifact rolls, can only occur on short blades (where it's not so amazing) and staves (and a lajatang of speed is, in fact, really amazing, especially since it has such a low skill requirement). I've seen Trog occasionally gift a late game artifact weapon (double/triple sword, battle/exec axe, etc.) with speed brand though. Always nice to have happen.  Elec and Pain are great on fast weapons. For most of a 3-rune game very little has rElec. Pain-resistant enemies are more common, but a lot of them (zombies, skels) aren't really a threat anyway, and since you've been training necromancy, you probably can address them with that.  Distortion is also nice on a fast weapon, but in late game or extended having enemies blink to range can be a bad thing (imagine giving an orb of fire or an ancient lich range on you), so eventually you want to switch off of it. (If you're with Lugonu, you can safely switch back and forth between a disto weapon and another weapon to address this.)  Holy Wrath is stellar in extended, but the same as having no brand at all against enemies it doesn't affect.   Antimagic is great against things with devastating magic, like OoFs, liches, etc. It's kinda pointless against other things though. In extended, of course, most of the real threats are in fact things with devastating magic.  Chaos is as likely as not to eventually kill you, though sometimes it can feel amazing right up until it does."
dcss,2w7r61,WinterShine,5,Tue Feb 17 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"It's great in the early game, when you can inflict the status and kite ogres and other otherwise hard to deal with foes.  Later on the damage it inflicts is less relevant and most enemies resist it or are outright immune.  Its effect is basically negligible on an Executioner's Axe, which deals a ton of damage per hit anyway and doesn't hit fast enough to apply multiple stacks of poison.  For a late 3-rune game, Vampiric is possibly the best brand. Antimagic and Holy are the best for extended, at least on heavy weapons.  Lighter weapons (most of all Quick Blades) benefit more from flat damage brands or stacking, such as distortion and electrocution or, in the non demonic part of the game, drain, venom and pain."

dcss,2w3r5v,inverted_inverter,3,Mon Feb 16 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"but I spent about a month trying to beat Red Sonja with absolutely zero success.    I find Red Sonja to be the easiest one (playing the 0.16 version), here's two strategies that you might want to try (both worked for me).  Spriggan Enchanter, turn off all skills except Spellcasting, Hexes, Enchanting, use berserk potion to kill Ijyb, rest for exhaustion to wear off, kill the ogre in the next room by sneaking up on him (one stab will kill him), always increase Dex on level ups, learn confusion and hibernation, sneak up and kill Sigmund, if he wakes up, cast confusion on him, stab him after he's confused. Now turn of all skills except Stealth, it will level extremely fast and reach 27 long before you finish, after that level up dodging and hexes. After killing Sigmund stab the green jelly and join Dithmenos (run away and cast confuse if it wakes up). Next proceed red jelly -> goat -> Sonja -> kobolds -> troll -> mushrooms (open door, cast charm, run back to avoid explosion) -> centaurs -> wasp -> oklob -> spiders -> small eye -> purple eyes -> red jellies -> zombies -> black worms (run away and close door if they wake up, don't try to confuse them unless you're confident it will work) -> gargoyle -> (skip Norris) -> hydra -> sheep. After this where you go depends on the items you've found in the shops, if you found fire resist you might want to go to the fire giants and dragons (past the 12 headed hydra), if you found scroll of holy word you might want to go the other route. Don't visit the mutating eyes unless you desperately need something from the 4 shops, killing the 27 headed hydra is optional. Don't try to kill Lom Lobon, you can sneak past him to the orb without waking him up, after that you need to haste/blink/magic protect/etc and run to the surface.  Troll Berserker of Trog - focus on Fighting and Unarmed combat, level up Dex each level, use berserk in all difficult fights, don't fight the hydra, you should have enough health to run past the other route.  If you know a way to beat Sprint IX: ""IIIIIIIIIIII"", I'd like to know, almost made it with an Ogre Hunter but the end is too difficult."
dcss,2w3r5v,inverted_inverter,2,Wed Feb 18 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I will give that a try.  One of things that's so difficult about Sprint is that there's almost no discussion about it online, especially from the more recent versions.  Makes it really hard to figure out good strategies!  I know that I was getting close to the end of Red Sonja, but I think I was trying too hard to kill all of the monsters, and not trying hard enough to grab the orb and run.  I forgot that I actually did finish linesprint (the |||||||||||||||||||| one).  I thought it would be impossible at first - all the Sprints seem impossible at first - but it turned out to be one of the easier ones.  Looking back at my morgue, it appears that I beat it using a Lava Orc Transmuter, which I have no memory of ever playing.  I am guessing that I was a follower of Chei, which makes Sprint pretty easy once you get enough piety for Slouch.  Because the piety gain is so high in Sprint, you can use it almost non-stop, which is how I beat The Pits as well.  Qazlal's Disaster Area ability is similar, since it gives you a huge, powerful area-of-effect attack at high Invocations.  In normal Crawl you can develop a playstyle that doesn't involve spamming these kinds of effects, but in Sprint the ridiculous challenge lends itself to some powergaming and exploiting possibilities.  I'm imagining that being a Lava Orc also helped, due to its passive heat aura effect.  The thing with linesprint, and a lot of the Sprint maps, is that you have to power up super fast to be able to deal with the next threat around the corner.  A lot of times, the ""hand"" of monsters you're getting dealt by the RNG does not give you enough experience to get powerful quickly, meaning a guaranteed death.  It's one of the more frustrating and unbalanced facets of Sprint, but it's also a great feeling when you get a strong start and tear your way through the map."
dcss,2w3r5v,pereza0,3,Wed Feb 18 23:16:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, you've probably already beaten Red Sonja, but a new strategy popped into my head and it worked beautifully, I actually felt guilty of how overpowered it is on this map.  Ghoul Monk! http://termbin.com/yiwx  The beautiful thing about ghouls is that, they're completely immune to poison (even clouds of foul pestilence near the orb) and never mutate. This allows you to abuse this map, get to Qazlals altar, and train only Invocations until it's 20, killing Sonja is trivial (you're immune to poison and she uses poison needles), pick up her curare needles and blowgun to shoot the troll in the next room, use Qazlals upheaval if you have to.   Now comes the amazing part, since you don't mutate, you can go to the room with mutating eyes and slaughter all of them, this will give you an enormous Skill boost (invocation up to 19), There's plenty of meat to cure your rotting (i.e. the room with hogs). With this much invocation an upheaval one hit kills many enemies (2 of the demonologist kobolds, 2 of the centaurs), 2 hits kill an Oklob plant. Now since you're immune to poison you can easily kill the poisonous spiders and gargoyle, disaster area kills all the zombies and red blobs in one shot. Upheaval will also kill the 3 hydras, 2 dragons, the Daeva, all the purple invisible eyes, the red Giants and the master archer! A single disaster area will clear the room where the oklob plant, mummy, nagas and bees are.  Essentially because you get such a huge invocation boost, and there's so much piety in Sprint, you can one shot most things with upheaval, which is disgustingly overpowered! For the Orb of Zot I used a potion of haste and blinked past Lom Lobon, closed the door, grabbed the orb and used scrolls of blink until I got to the other side of the water, after that I just had to go back to the surface!"

Having said that, it depends on the type of player. I don't usually go into a new roguelike with 15 spoiler tabs open in my web browser because I'm trying to beat it in as few attempts as possible. At first I prefer to play unspoiled because the initial self-discovery is fun. When I get to the arbitrary point of exhausting self-discovery and wanting to do better, that's when it is spoiler central and game face time.

dcss,2vzabz,DrStalker,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"Try to think of ways you could have averted it.   This is the biggest help; look at your equipment, think of what you did after the threat.  For me the biggest things were:   What consumables would have helped?  There's no point saving them, you're dead now so they are wasted.   At what point should you have tried to escape, and how?  You don't have to kill everything, there's no shame in leaving to come back later (or to never come back)   Some other helpful tips:  Never move towards enemies unless you have a damned good reason to do so.  Stand your ground or move back to a better fighting position.  If you are waiting for things to get into melee range throw stuff at them.  throwing is basically free damage, even if you're just throwing rocks.  If you use autofight (tab) edit the config so it will throw instead of moving closer and set your health warnings to 50%; if you drop to 50% you need to assess the situation instead of auto-attacking  Fight in choke points so you have to deal with one enemy at a time.   MiBe is probably the easiest class/race combo to play, Beserker gives you a nice collection of abilities for tough fights.  (rest after beserking before moving on!) while playing as magic users is much harder (in my experience, other people do a much better job with them than I do)"

Rarely it will make the difference between life and death.   The first and foremost thing you need to do is always always always fight one on one. You move the same rate as most enemies,  and therefore can make sure you are fighting in a corridor or the like where they can't hang up on you. The second thing you need to do is fight primarily in cleared areas.  Every fight makes noise,  the closer that noise is to unexplored areas,  the more likely you are to draw things to you before you are ready for them.  The third thing you need to do is understand line of sight.  Creatures that attack you at range need a clear line of fire to hit you,  you can exploit this by keeping ranged attackers behind things (including other creatures) in order to draw them to you so you can attack them in melee combat. Pay attention to how creatures move,  by taking the correct positions you can force them into a better position for you. The fourth thing you should do (after you get good at the other three) is worry about training and micro managing your skills."

dcss,2vzabz,SquidThistle,2,Tue Feb 17 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Some things that have really helped me:   Use your items. Don't try to hoard them or let yourself think ""I might need this later"". If something can get you out of a tough spot use it. Don't approach enemies. If you turn a corner and see an enemy you have a few choices. (1) You can run toward it which runs the risk of even more monsters noticing you. (2) You can hit '.' and wait for it to come to you. This gives you the advantage of being able to hit first in most cases. (3) Run away back to a choke point. This is especially necessary when engaging more than one enemy. Why take damage from two when you can only take damage from one? Save your scrolls of identify for ID-ing potions. Mistakenly quaffing some potions can be game ending early on. Don't take chances on un-IDed potions unless it's a dire situation and you've exhausted all other options.  Use-Identify scrolls only after you've cleared a level. You don't want to find yourself having teleported into a horde of orcs or reading a scroll of noise only to find that you've attracted half the level to your location. Use your skill screen to train specific skills. First, train up your 'killdudes' skill. Anything that your character might use to dispatch enemies. (Note: if you're training a weapon, hit '@' to see stats on your character. If it says your attack speed is fast and cannot be advanced further with training you've reached the fastest attack speed you can. You should switch to training more skills at this point.) After that's sufficiently trained and you feel like taking out monsters isn't a problem anymore, start training things that help you to not die to dudes."
dcss,2vzabz,anhero23,2,Tue Feb 17 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"Here's a decent tank strat to follow (of course this isn't the best, or the one you should deff. follow, yadda yadda yadda. It has worked pretty damn well for me. Won an 8 rune game with it too):   Start with a MiFi. Best health/lvl in the game. I think... Immediately train up your weapon skill to lvl 10 (axe is a good newbie choice because of their cleaving. you should get used to positioning yourself so as not to get surrounded. the idea is to use other better weapons when you figure that out. maces, etc. Axes make it more likely for you to get tempted into getting surrounded.) train your armour and fighting up to lvl 10. I usually go armour first, then shields to lvl 10 Pick Oka as your god. When you've got all of those early skills to lvl 10, get invoc. up to 7ish. This will allow you to use Oka's finesse ability with a 10-20% fail rate.   By now, you should have some cool items. If you have enough evocable items and want to put the training in, bumping up evoc to lvl 5ish wouldn't be too bad a move. Eventually you'll want to get your weapons skill up to about 17 to maximize your hitting speed. And don't forget about the defense skills. When you start taking a bit more damage than what is comfortable, use that as a way of telling yourself to start training other skills. Remember, if you find (or are gifted from oka) a heavy suit of armour like crystal plate, you should immediately sink some time into training armour. Same with finding a huge shield: sink some time into the shield skill. Without high enough skill, those heavy pieces of equip. will slow you down and make you a sitting duck. The faster you can take advantage of heavy armour (and shields), the better.  HOWEVER, none of this means anything if you don't get positioning down and learn how to run. One of the most common ways to die as a tank is to get cocky. Oh, you found the +9 Gold Dragon King Armour? Cool. Don't go down to Vault 5 with it. I made that mistake just recently... There are two Hill Giants approaching you after you climb down a stairs? Lure one up the stairs. You don't get more experience by doing stupid stuff. Guerrilla tactics all day every day.  And don't forget about resistances. If you don't have a source of poison resistance, then respect all monsters that can poison. Some battles will have you switching rings (among other things) to get the resistance you need. I was once in a corridor and was set on by what seemed to be about 20 different elemental demon assholes. They were half ice, half fire. They don't fire through each other, so I just switched my rings out whenever one came up to me.  And sometimes... you just gotta run. You can't always kill everything. Big learning points about this that kill a lot of players are Sigmund and Sonja. These two uniques can be incredibly dangerous early on if you are unlucky. Sigmund comes with a random assortment of stuff, sometimes he'll have a wand and that's really bad... If you happen upon Sonja before getting rPoison, you're pretty fucked if you aren't near a stairs. This is why it's so damn important to save escape items, like wands of tele or haste. Always try to hold onto escape items. The new version of crawl has bumped up ood (out of depth) monsters to counteract some of the difficulty nerfs.  Once you start to get the hang of tanks, then the other styles might start to open up to you a bit more. Don't forget! Ask questions if you're unsure. We always love to help out other crawlers."
dcss,2vzabz,haqrboi,2,Sun Feb 15 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"When picking target values for skills, get weapon to min attack delay (http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Weapon_speed), and shield to whatever you need to carry it without slowing/interrupting attacks (http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Shields).  10 won't work for min delay for any of the axes, and 17 isn't optimal for any weapon. 10 shields is too much for a buckler, and too little for a shield (if we're talking Mi*). Just aiming for 10 seems inefficient.  About weapon choices, I'd suggest Maces/flails as a good newbie category.

The midgame feels harder (lair branches, vaults) and the late game feels a bit harder due to the depths.

Even if you think this did make it notably easier on balance - I will point out that new corrosion is much more dangerous but that's not a big part of the game - the dungeon got nastier pretty much every version since I started playing with 0.10. The only argument I'd buy that the game as a whole got easier in that period is that they did add some strong races like VS and Gr. Which also has a lot more to with the early game than item destruction but really amounts to adding a few new ""easy starts"" which are not easier starts than the easiest ones we already had.  edit: tldr mostly you just got better. 0.16 is doing a few notable hard things like the already-infamous caustic shrike. But the overall tendency for some time seems to be to add fairly strong character options while consistently making the dungeon harder. I guess few of the dungeon changes really affect the early game that much. That's about how it should be though because it's still statistically the most dangerous part, with newbies barely getting by, whereas veteran players tend to appreciate when they spice up the mid->late game."

I would argue once you have shaolin on you may want to just abandon the +0 shield and see if there are any good great maces in the dungeon -- 58/24 ac/ev is enough to not really need shields, and the higher base damage of great maces will give you a good boost in offense.

dcss,2vferj,Eptagon,7,Tue Feb 10 16:08:57 2015 UTC,"Ice caves, unlike volcanoes, tend to be really deadly. So I tend to play cautiously and bail early if things look poor. The deeper in the dungeon I find them the more careful I tend to be, as the late ones tend to have the fiends.  If you have /digging, popping it in a couple places might find you an alternate way across (not too likely, you tend to uncover more deep water), or at least give you a view of what's to come.  I see an unexplored square 4 down and 2 right from where you are. If that square is a floor tile then it's not necessary to use flight to cross the water. If it is a wall, that's still probably the area I'd try to dig since it looks like the water ends around there.  As for whether you should fight an ice fiend over loot, probably not. They can be pretty deadly. It's not just torment you'd be worried about, but bolt of cold, and AC-ignoring cold damage bonuses on its melee attacks. Also, your weapon isn't exactly ideal for ice fiends. With only that screenshot it's kinda hard to tell what your character's all about (can't see if you have rC for example).   All that said, if you have a clear path back to the start (that is, you can cross back over the water if that turns out to be necessary), it's not particularly hard to walk away from one."
dcss,2vferj,WinterShine,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"rC+, rC++ when Qazlal saw fit. Guess I would have run from a Fiend, but turned out /u/klockklock was correct and it was just a Frost Giant.  Wouldn't have dreamed of meleeing the damn thing, btw. Had I not managed to kill it from afar I would have tried to run, I guess.  Thanks for the advice, anywho."
dcss,2vferj,WinterShine,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"I'd run very quickly in a fight with a fiend then, yeah. Without looking up a fiend's damage, at 77 HP, I imagine that torment + bolt of cold or maybe even 2x bolt of cold would be enough to two-shot you even with rC+. I haven't played Qazlal too much, but from the little I have, I'd say pretending his resist buff doesn't exist when deciding what to do is the safest way to play.  Edit: I looked up Ice Fiend's bolt of cold spell. It's 3d27 damage, so 3-81. A very (un)lucky hit could take off half your HP even with rC+ (which gives 50% protection). With torment protection I suppose the fiend would need 3 turns to do you in lol.  Edit 2: That's from Gretell, so it's 0.12- or 0.13-, but I don't think Ice Fiends have changed. Wish the new bot was available outside IRC."

Doing Vaults up to 4, not sure whether to go down to 5 or go do Elf or some Depths, then. Or Crypt. Crypt should be easy enough, as a Gr."
dcss,2vferj,PigTailSock,2,Wed Feb 11 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"I see you've already gone ahead, but I'll post this advice anyway.  Rule of thumb: Never do Elf. If you're strong enough to safely do Elf, then you don't need the XP or loot. If you need the XP or loot, you're not strong enough to safely do Elf. Elf:1-2 is relatively safe, but also worth pretty much nothing (unless you want a longbow and one hasn't dropped). Elf:3 can be quite deadly.  There are exceptions to this, but mostly they have to do with characters who have 3 runes and want more. (A blaster mage might try to pick up an enhancer staff they haven't found yet here, for instance.)  Crypt is honestly also skippable. You can go grind in there if you want I suppose, but I haven't popped in Crypt in ages unless I was intending to get to Tomb. Ever since that massive Crypt overhaul it hasn't really been worth it imo.  Generally after you're done in the Lair branches and Vaults:1-4, you would do Depths:1-5 next, then just grab your three runes of choice, hit Zot and win. Depths can also be quite deadly, of course, but the difference is that it's a necessary risk versus an optional one. It's worth a lot more XP than Elf too, I believe.  The usual order would be:  Lair --> Orc --> D:15 --> Lair Branches:1-4, get a rune or two --> Vaults:1-4 --> Depths --> 3 runes + win"
dcss,2vferj,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that Elf is usually a bad idea.  But I like ridding the dungeon of elves.  Also, Vaults had enough elves in it, for me to practice on, that I figured I could take their whole turf on as well.  I was hoping for some nice artifacts too, from the final vault in Elf:3. Alas, nothing good spawned/dropped.  Crypt basically only had Curse Skulls as reasonable threats, as a Gr. Maybe I'm underestimating the branch, but it seems like a negligible risk, albeit with a low reward, for a Gargoyle.  All this said, if I had had in mind to stop at 3 runes it's possible I'd have avoided Elf and Crypt altogether, but I'm going to get more, if I don't die in the process."

That said, my personal experience may or may not be the most accurate representation of the odds of finding stuff like that.  I do tend to follow the rule that, if I care about my run, I don't go into a volcano or ice cave without at least one tick of the appropriate resist in any case. I'm not usually wowed by the loot regardless. (Though I suppose you can try to get your one tick of rF or rC that way due to how loot generation works.)"

I don't however (and tell others they should) run away from a frost giant while I do have rC, 32 AC, +6 demon blade of venom and full Qazlal piety and there is nothing but him standing between me and full Ice Cave loot.

At least that's my opinion."
dcss,2vferj,Baljet,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"It really depends on whether disaster area is overkill for the enemy you're trying to beat. My experience (purely anecdotal unfortunately) was that if the enemy was tough enough to require multiple upheavals (maybe 5,6 or even as high as 10) they'd still usually be taken down in one disaster area, so the piety cost was actually better to use disaster area."
dcss,2vferj,rabel,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like we're talking about luck now, because you won't get such a ratio unless you're repeatedly rolling elements that the target is resistant to and that can happen with both invocations. You just notice it more with the invo that's used more often.  With an Ice Fiend, it would be 1/4 immune and 1/4 weakness, so those are decent odds."

Also, a falchion of electricity is a good early game fighting weapon but not a great stabber weapon.  On the other hand, my first ever 15 rune win was a DSWz of Kiku who had Nightstalker and found the FE starter book on D2, so I can tell you from firsthand experience that a DS of Kiku with Nightstalker and early fire magic can be effective.  Fire magic can be tricky with Kiku because it often hurts your minions, though.  I ended up mostly just using it as a strong early offense (especially sticky flame) to carry me through Lair while I waited to get my core necromancy spells online, then switched to using primarily bolt of draining and undead minions (you can shoot draining through your minions without hurting them).  On the other other hand, Dith actually is a very good conjurations god for anyone except FE, so if you survive the transition from fire to ice magic Dith will be a strong god choice even if stabbing doesn't work out for you.  But that's a risky transition, even with an elec weapon."

dcss,2vd2pk,SvalbardCaretaker,3,Tue Feb 10 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"Are you hoping for 15 runes or just planning for 3?  Necromutation's not even close to worth it for 3 runes.  Even for 15 runes, it's extremely debatable, especially if you worship Kiku, since Kiku already provides torment and mummy curse resistance.  Death's Door and Bjorg's are better spells for most characters, and especially better spells for Kiku worshippers.  They're the two best emergency spells in the game.  Fire storm also doesn't have the best synergy with Kiku.  Kiku's biggest strengths are the pain brand and an unlimited supply of corpses.  Fire Storm will kill your own undead minions, reducing the power of infinite corpses, and if you're using conjurations as your main offense then the pain brand loses value.  That's not to say the combo can't work, it's just not very synergistic.  Especially with nightstalker, since it'll be harder to aim your firestorm somewhere where your undead won't get hit.  Personally, from my two Kiku wins (15 runes as a DsWz and 4 runes as a VpEn), I've found the best use of Kiku late game is using request corpses to get on-demand armies of zombies and/or simulacrums.  The Request Corpses + Simulacrum is stupidly powerful late game.  A few casts of request corpses and simulacrum can give you enough to easily take down most Pan and Hell lords.  Then you can either fight alongside your minions in melee with a pain brand (or other brand for enemies immune to pain) or from behind them with spells, ideally either smite-targeted spells or spells that undead are heavily resistant or immune to (poison spells, negative energy spells, or cold spells, generally).  If you're not planning to use many undead minions and just want to be a firestormer, then I don't think Kiku's really worth it just for the gifts."

'twas awesome; BUT I had an early ring of invisibility. Main problem is low stealth aptitude, so its hard to get up. If you do decide to do it I'd forget about ice magic for a while, dodging+long blades are fine. Elec weapons are that strong! You just have to run a lot more than otherwise. I for my part had an absolute blast nightstalkering with dithmenos."
dcss,2vd2pk,Weeksy,1 point,Tue Feb 10 10:42:29 2015 UTC,"You're only xl 5, which is so early that many paths are open to you. One option is to keep training fire until sticky flame is at a low fail rate, and then focus on defense and weapon skills, and pick a good hybrid god such as okawaru, ashenzari, makhleb, kiku, or even fedhas (of course you can't go dithmenos with fire magic). Conjure flame and especially sticky flame are enough to get you through the early game. Stealth and smaller LOS will help just about any character, so don't think it will get wasted just because you aren't stabbing."

I always found transmuters to have terrible early game, but I guess +6 int ring is a pretty huge windfall as far as getting blade hands online.  I generally had better luck doing the naga transmuter path by starting as a venom mage or wizard, they have better starting stats, skills, and spells, but of course you have to find the transmutations spellbooks.    Venom mage also starts with stealth trained, in my experience if you're a naga you need to have some stealth in the early game so that you can choose your battles.  Otherwise you're forced into every battle which is a huge problem unless you can easily overpower any enemy.  Spider form, blink, and mephitic cloud help a lot but are unreliable or multi-school (take a while to be able to be able to cast).  Add on the fact that you have low mana and low skill aptitudes on naga and it's easy for a couple of miscasts to kill you."

The 'false' informs how_mutated to not check innate mutations, and the 'true' means to add up levels of a tiered mutation (so Claws 2 would count as two mutations, if it weren't innate).  Ergo, demonspawn innate mutations do NOT confer mutation resistance from random mutations. I don't see any other call to how_mutated in mutation.cc, and in particular no calls of the form how_mutated(true,___), so unless there are calls to it from other files which are used to compute resistance to mutations, it looks like innate mutations just don't count for this."

dcss,2uyrio,pork_spare_ribs,2,Sun Feb 8 04:17:03 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of general advice. If your intent is to keep the possibility of a 15 rune ascension available I'd advise doing whichever hell branch(es) you are confident in before Pan. The downside of Pan versus hell is that if you land in a level with a rune Boss that you're unable to defeat with your current gear you're probably going to die or give up on that rune. Hell is at least a set challenge, you can prepare ahead of time. And all floors in Hell branches have stairs leading back to Hell, instead of up-stairs, or possibly no stairs (like pan).   When you do Tomb be sure to take advantage of fog and stairdance every available chance on the third level. The third level is similar to the vaults 5 experience, you'll be enduring a huge wave of horrifying high-level mummies tormenting and smiting you.  Character advice: In terms of spellcasting you have a good variety currently. Given your experience investments already I'd focus heavily on training conjurations and either fire/ice so you can get Firestorm or Glaciate online. It might be too late to aim for high level spells in schools that you haven't trained in yet, like Necro or Transfig (it probably is but I don't have enough experience in late-game switching to say for certain). If you can learn haste you should do it, that's the only accessible ""should always have when available"" tier spell you're lacking."
dcss,2uyrio,clamsarepeople2,1 point,Sun Feb 8 05:57:47 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't found haste yet. I have plenty of consumable hasting right now. I'll start working towards Firestorm now (Glaciate isn't smite-targeted, right?)"
dcss,2uyrio,clamsarepeople2,2,Sun Feb 8 08:26:54 2015 UTC,"not sure about glaciate targeting, i'd consult the wiki, or just ask it to a high level caster as a spectator if you need a quick answer. I'm sure you'll find haste eventually. Zig farming can be good, but remember that a zig is always doable until it's absolutely going to kill you. Most people breeze through all subsequent levels then get absolutely destroyed on the level that kills them (silence or tomb theme are the big ones). Doing up to say floor 10 should be no risk if you're smart.  If you're looking to mine experience to get spells online I'd recommend abyss over pan because of the lowered difficulty. Also fully exploring Hell branches should net a good amount, just make sure not to ever explore much of hell when you're at half health or less. Always be confident that you could win a fight with 1-2 torments cast on you.Because of this I'd recommend abyss, early zigs, and pan for exp mining versus Hell."
dcss,2uyrio,TungstenYUNOMELT,2,Sun Feb 8 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"Looks like Glaciate fires out in front of you as a cone, which actually might make it better since I don't have much in the way of close-range capability besides melee.

dcss,2uxi30,retArDD865,4,Fri Feb 6 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that Zin is better than TSO in the early game. TSO just doesn't have much to offer early -- his halo works fine for an accuracy boost, but his cleansing flame is fairly ineffective early, and his summons cost a lot of piety, which you're probably not gaining much of at that stage. rN is nigh useless before extended, and undead/demons aren't really common enough for the heals to matter (esp. since early game undead are usually pushovers, unless simulacra count).  I believe that Zin's hell protection got nerfed in 0.16. I found a changelog on Google that said it now caps out at 50%, so I'm not sure if switching TSO --> Zin for Hell is still a thing. 50% protection is probably still really nice though.  If you start with Zin, I'd stick with it until the end of the 3-rune part of the game at least, since its powers are more useful there. I believe most people who switch to TSO do so just before Crypt, which is great for building up TSO piety."
dcss,2uxi30,WinterShine,2,Fri Feb 6 01:39:13 2015 UTC,"Zin. Early piety gain, useful powers etc. TSO has very slow piety gain, and its powers are a tad too expensive to be really useful."

Although, Qaz is amazing in Zigs, I've cleared 2 of them, although you should be careful at levels 15+ usually due to probable -cTele.  I had some problems with Cerebov, Anthaeus and Dispater due to lack of melee power, but they died after some regrouping and burning through consumables.

You're also probably going to want some more elemental resistances (even if you stick with Qaz).

You should see your EV start going up after a few levels.  You should have rF and rMut for orbs of fire. rF++ is enough I would think, and you already have an rMut amulet. Also, I would suggest that you keep that crystal plate armor on, as the AC is worth more than an extra pip of rF.  My only win so far was with a MiFi and I don't recall having much problem with Zot:5. Just clear it slowly, moving back upstairs if necessary to deal with enemies one by one. Don't deal with more than one orb of fire at a time if you can help it!  For the ascent, before picking up the orb, I took the time to find the fastest route from Zot:5 to D:1, and dug corridors as necessary to minimize the distance between staircases. If you have the patience to do this it can really help. Try to be hasted all the time on the way up, as well.   I'm not sure if my experience was typical, but again I didn't have as much trouble as I thought I would've on the ascent. I just kept moving and enemy generation wasn't too overwhelming.

There wasn't a lot you could do to get out of that situation. The best would've probably been to have removed the -tele ring and used a teleport scroll, but its unlikely that you would have survived long enough to get out.  For the most part, the skilled players aren't that much better at getting out of situations like this, but rather better at not getting into them in the first place. For example if you were 3 slots north when this fight went down, then you would have been fighting each undead enemy one on one, and would've had a lot more turns for a teleport to go off if needed.

The Slay+3 is nice, but the base type of scale mail is poor, especially compared to say a plate armour. I would also remove the inaccuracy amulet.   I'm not sure why you have so much skill in both maces and axes. It seems you mostly have good axe weapons, but you'll need a ridiculous amount of axes skill to get those to min delay. You can drop the mace, war axe, and halberd as the base types for all of those weapons are poor.   You should read-ID all your unidentified scrolls.

A lot of what it takes to succeed in crawl is preventing these bad outcome situations from occurring in the first place.  Your only means to readily escape in this scenario was a scroll of teleport (since the hydra can keep up with you in the water even if you're hasted), and that takes a few turns to kick in. In this scenario you should have read teleport before you were on half health. A little more difficult would be recognizing that the Lernaean Hydra wasn't a good fight to get into in the first place, but that's something only experience can provide.  Incidentally, I also see you were unbuffed. You had haste, might, and agility potions, and summoning scrolls in your inventory -- these are invaluable resources, but (except for using haste to escape) they need to be used before a fight begins to really be effective. And trust me, things like might and agility really do make a difference. I don't know that they would have enabled you to defeat the hydra here, but if you're going into a fight you know will be really hard, you should be using buffs.   I suppose this is a second takeaway: learn to use consumables. Don't learn when to use them -- just learn to use them at all, as opposed to trying to save them.  So yeah.

The way I see it, you have a few paths you could take.  1) Scroll of Fear. The Hydra has MR 120 (incredibly resistant), so the chances are slim but the pay-off would be great. Follow this up with teleport, regen and running the fuck away if it works. If it doesn't, you're fucked. Depending on random rolls, you may only have 1 turn for anything so this might even be your only realistic shot.  2) Scroll of Teleport --> Quaff Heal Wounds --> Potion of Haste --> Run away  3) Summon allies (scrolls or Trog), scroll of Teleport and run away.   Too bad you don't have Scroll of Blinking... Good luck!"

dcss,2uj96x,WinterShine,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"Tele first reduces the number of turns you're next to the hydra. Heal wounds next is probably mandatory to stay alive. Haste is more for if you survive up to the point where you teleport -- having haste on arrival improves your odds of getting away from whatever's there. Because of the lack of land near OP's character, hasted movement won't help a great deal.  Still, I'm not sure there's an order to use those in that would have saved OP in this scenario."
dcss,2uj96x,TungstenYUNOMELT,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"My point is that if you haste first then casting tele and quaffing HW takes less time.  Once you are done quaffing HW and assuming you survived you can start running while waiting for the TP to kick in.  I don't know for sure, but I have a feeling this would help in survival.  Some fuzzy math would be like this (not sure if accurate): tp:1 aut, hw:1 aut, haste:1 aut => 3 aut before you start running haste:1 aut, tp:0.66 aut, hw:0.66 aut =>  2.32 aut before you start running  If you also try reading fear then the difference becomes 4 aut vs 3 aut."
dcss,2uj96x,amalloy,1 point,Tue Feb 3 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but often what you really need to escape is the teleport ASAP. Getting through the other stuff half a turn faster doesn't matter as much. And that's really the tradeoff between the two lines: if you teleport first you get that in much sooner, the !hw a little sooner, and the other stuff (!haste, running) later. If running is a way out of the mess, then sure, quaff haste first and don't even bother with the other stuff until you're out of range. But if you need to teleport, eg because you can't outrun the monster, ?tele + !hw is your priority, and delaying it to haste is a net loss."

dcss,2uhzd0,droogie-vr,3,Mon Feb 2 08:26:48 2015 UTC,"Going to second most of what zxc223 said.   Get a real weapon.  Flails are not good end game weapons cause their base damage is subpar and that is the most important factor on a weapon when you start hitting big things with bigger armour.  Also, I hate the distortion brand on a melee char.  Randomly blinking a dangerous enemy when you need to kill it asap can get you into a lot of trouble.  Its a lot better for a spellcaster that uses melee as a secondary option.  Ctrl+f for ""mace && ego"" or ""mace  && artif"" to search the dungeon. Your rings suck.  Throw ""Ebomunle"" in the trash cause rF- is awful.  A plain ring of magic resistance would be a lot better.  And ring of the Octopus King is very suboptimal.  In genera stat gain rings are worse than resistances or real big AC/EV gains (+1 barely counts). I'm sure you can find something better in the dungeon.  Do a Ctrl+f and type ""jewel && ring"".  Your main goal should be to have rF++ or rF+++ to guard against OOFs and one level in most other resistances (the first level is most important).  rElec is situational so you can have that in a swappable and some added rN wouldn't hurt if you run into cursed toes or other sources of torment.     That slaying ring you have in your inventory is fantastic however.   Wear it asap.  If you want to be optimal then its a good idea to wear the amulet of guardian spirit and swap in rMut when needed (vs OOFs mostly).  Other than that I think you're fine for Zot right now.  Your defenses are good although your skills aren't optimal.  I would have trained some evocation at some point (5-15 depending on what you got) to use the fantastic evokables in the game.  And you have plenty of haste, HW and blinking to get away safely from hairy situations.  Just go slow, especially in Z:5  You really don't need any spells for a 3 rune win.  Oka is good for a hybrid but its fine for a spell-less char as well.  Trog is stronger in the very early game, where berserk lets you survive situations that you really have no business surviving, but I think Oka is stronger in the late game (finesse is insane and berserk loses a lot of value cause it becomes too risky to use)."

I should really train evocations a bit because a spell like that would have been extremely useful.  I felt like I was doing awesome, was not aware that my setup was that good, but even with it I still had a couple of close calls which I believe were just due to my inexperience and getting into sticky situations that were probably avoidable. I really wanted to go for an extended run and it was tempting because of being the first time finally getting that far and dominating the areas I was in... but in the end I wanted to at least get a win on my score card. I've been doing a couple more attempts with variations of like VpAs, DEIE, MuIE, MuIF... which most have gone to the dumps real fast or end with something stupid like banishment to the abyss right after I'm all setup and awesome flying through the shoals, I get too confident and do something stupid...

I want to set up a media centre with one. And if it had crawl, too...  I had thought that Nemelex only gifted two types of decks now, but I think I may have been mistaken. I used summoning decks pretty heavily, and I thought they were one that he wouldn't give any more. I don't think that's correct, though.  This was all I could find in the change log:  ""Alter the decks Nemelex gifts. Decks of war and decks of escape are now Nemelex' decks; decks of wonders contain the cards that Nemelex doesn't gift. Some cards have been move to fit this.  Warp (blink) and Portal (teleport) cards are removed.""  I guess I'm going to have to play him again and see."

Pan lords are randomized, so you have no idea what sorts of nastiness they will have in store for you. (top-tier elemental spells such as fire storm and glaciate are a good guess though!)  Here is the wiki article for them http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Pan_lord  I'd suggest firing off a teleport immediately and hoping it sends you near the exit. If you get dropped in the cacky, which you quite likely will, the scrolls of holy word are your friends. Between the tele, the holy words, and the scrolls of fog to reduce LOS, you stand a solid chance of surviving a dash for the exit. The scrolls of fear are useless vs non-natural holiness monsters, so they won't help at all."

dcss,2ufomv,Baloroth,4,Sun Feb 1 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't terrible. You're with Vehumet, so I assume you use magic primarily to kill dudes. You can't wield a staff or rod now, but that's about the extent of the drawback. The tradeoff is a weapon that can blink, teleport or banish foes. A war axe isn't the best thing to have that on, but at least it's +8. Just use it cautiously (don't mindlessly tab strong enemies hoping they get banished). I might train a bit of axes to get delay < 1.0 once you can spare the xp for it.  Having contam on there is a bit trolly though. Just save a cancelation potion for when you're ready to unwield I guess."
dcss,2ufomv,WinterShine,2,Sun Feb 1 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not the end of the world (it's actually a decent weapon otherwise, at least it's not -5 or something). But distortion and contam?

dcss,2uhed9,kablaq,3,Mon Feb 2 04:32:48 2015 UTC,"If you haven't won before, I'd encourage you to consider winning with three runes rather than gambling on extended, which is very likely to kill someone inexperienced with it. That said, if you do wish to do extended, don't do Zot:5 until you are ready to win. It's extremely dangerous, and likely to get you malmutated.  When going for a win, my usual MO is to dive through Zot quickly rather than explore every level. Mapping is great for this. You'll probably need to clear one half of the Zot:5 ""lungs"" though, so do be careful and prepared. Don't forget your consumables: fog, resistance, might, haste, silence, and others are all invaluable."
dcss,2uhed9,WinterShine,2,Mon Feb 2 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"First things first, before you plan on making a serious attempt at any other rune branches you need to clear out Depths and at least Zot 1-4. You need to do that anyway, and if you can do that without much problem you're probably good to get more runes provided you have the right equipment.  Slime is a bitch without rcorr and rmut, and you can expect to get corroded and mutated even with both. Pan is easier then Hell, but you need to enter with the equipment to tackle any of the 4 preset panlords, so I tend to do pan after SOME hell.  The big scary problems in Zot are orbs of fire, curse toes if you lack clarity, ancient liches, and packs of draconians. Draconians are like a merger of ugly things and gnolls, except they have breath weapons and some similar classes as orcs. They'll challenge you like gnolls did in the early game.   Vaults 5 will give you nice loot, but if you haven't been there before be aware that you're walking into an ambush. You'll be surrounded by a large circular group of vault guards, sentinals, etc. If you're unlucky and a warden is in that group they'll seal the stairs, so it's best that you go down and be buffed as much as possible, or pop a tele then go down immediately."
dcss,2uhed9,clamsarepeople2,2,Mon Feb 2 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"Lots of people recommend ""just win 3 rune first game so you have a win on the board"". This is definitely true if you want a win, but if you don't care about that just take your character as far as they will go! Clear down to Zot:4, get the Vaults rune and then your safest bet to explore further would be Pan, most likely."
dcss,2uhed9,pork_spare_ribs,2,Mon Feb 2 06:02:50 2015 UTC,"Do not attempt slime without rCorr.  The chance of dying is way to high, especially if you haven't done slime before.  I'd take the a 3 rune win now if I were you.  Getting the first win is an important milestone.  Extended isn't hard if you are prepared for everything in there but you aren't and will most likely die.  And if you're anything like me then you will be pissed off that you didn't take the win when you could.  Vaults 5 is tricky but not impossible if you are cautious.  Just pop haste, dive down, blink away from the welcoming party, run away until you reach the edge of the map and run into the 2-wide hallways on the edge and make your stand.  Don't let yourself get surrounded and try to fight only 2 at once by regularly backing away.  Summon some allies if you can and beat down the chasing horde.  AOE evokables are a great help.    Once you cleared the initial onslaught then carefully explore around the edge and be ready to run away if it gets tough (it most likely will).  Lure groups back into the 2-wide corridor.  Kill any Vault Wardens on sight to make escaping possible.  Javs of penetration and decent throwing are a good way to smite them inside a crowd.    Avoid fighting in the middle cross cause the volume of monsters that can reach you gets overwhelming fast and the upstairs can get locked instantly or you get entangled by a tentacled monstrosity and surrounded by infinite dudes.  A more complex approach would be to activate control teleport, haste, dive to V:5, read magic mapping, activate TP and TP straight to the edge.  Slightly safer but requires a lot more stuff.  Do NOT randomly TP unless its your only possible escape cause you can get stuck in an unwinnable situation."
dcss,2uhed9,TungstenYUNOMELT,2,Mon Feb 2 11:47:03 2015 UTC,"One tip for Zot is to have a handy method of disintegrating iron grates.   On 0.15 I lost a promising character recently, when right after descending to a new Zot floor, an iron grate appeared, blocking the up staircase and I subsequently got mobbed by monsters and couldn't stair dance out of there.   So a wand of disintegration or a spell that can break though grates is important to in Zot to keep your escape options open."

A max enchanted SwDA will give you 14+ AC, and Spriggans are pretty lacking in the AC department, so the EV hit is worth it imo."

What exactly is a challenge depends on your character, of course (silenced floors are fun as a caster), but IMHO, it's simply not worth it. That's exemplified by things like accidentally forgetting all your wands on the last floor (I know, I know) and thinking ""well, whatever"". But by all means, try it out, maybe you'll like it.  Edit: Though I'm at something like five or so? Maybe with the exponential increases, there will be an additional level of challenge, but I can't imagine it will actually become more fun.

dcss,2ub15d,Chochkeys,5,Sat Jan 31 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"Because of their squishiness and limited mana, magic users need to rely more on tactics that allow them to split up packs or escape fights without using consumables than melee characters do.  I:n on my phone now, but later I can hunt down a link to Patashu's rules   it's a giant post a guy made at the tavern that includes a huge amount of good advice, including a lot of tricks for avoiding disadvantageous fights by splitting up packs of enemies and avoiding fighting then in bad positions.  Another key thing with casters is that You don't have to kill everything with spells.  Even with no weapon training, you can kill things like rats and whatnot early on with melee if you just pick up an okay weapon (venom or elec weapons are very useful early on for casters).  That way, if you're fighting a pack of rats an an Orc priest shows up you're actually prepared.  I also don't know what casters your're trying or how far you're getting.  If you're playing elves, try tankier races that can still cast spells competently like HO or Gr.  If you're playing wizards, try switching to a more offensive casters like conjurers or fire elementalists.  Also, this might not matter depending on how far you're getting, but don't feel like you have to go Sif or Veh.  I spent ages splatting deep elf and tengu casters of Veh or Sif in early dungeon or lair, getting a few farther but never getting much farther than Lair.  Then I tried a DsWz of Kiku and won my firth 15-runer.  Kiku, Dith, and Ash are all excellent gods for casters (I've seen some people say that Dith is the best mage got if you're not using fire), although they take some piety to get really strong.  Fedhas can become incredibly powerful with just a star or two of piety if you don't mind managing your mushrooms."

dcss,2ub15d,Quazifuji,4,Sat Jan 31 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"You should give a fire elementalist a try, conjure flame lets you put a flaming cloud in an unoccupied square and you just run away while your enemies (usually) wait for it to dissipate. conjurers will carry over a bit better through lair and the mid-game but it seems like you need more help in the early dungeon.  Always act like this run is the only run you have, when you get an enemies attention retreat to an explored area and then fight them alone. If you find a sleeping enemy who you think poses a moderate threat of killing you leave them alone and come back (you can place exclusions to ignore areas on autoexplore by pressing shift+x then e over the monster/area).  The best way to learn is often to spectate, and the best time to spectate someone is in the early dungeon. Watching someone conquer hell generally won't give you much that helps your play style since they'll be insta-killing virtually everything. But watching a deep elf or a mummy struggle through the early dungeon will give you a lot you can incorporate into your own game."
dcss,2ub15d,deadcelebrities,2,Sat Jan 31 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"Wizards are tricky because they have a lack of good offensive spells in their starting book, so they have to rely on their defensive spells for a while and hope they find a more powerful means of offense because magic dart becomes obsolete.  Conjurers are stronger, offensively.  In the case of groups of Gnolls on D6, conjure flame or mephitic cloud would help a lot on a wizard to keep then away (whether it's to give you a chance to run or to kill then), and a conjurer should be able to take them out with searing ray in a hallway or dazzling spray elsewhere.  Of course, there's also the powerful defensive technique of just running away from enemies that are strong but not faster than you, as long as you don't get netted."

For gnolls, hit them with mephitic cloud and then run to a corridor. Cast conjure flame to keep them back, confuse them again, and pelt them with conjurations.   If you want a caster with an easier start, I recommend gargoyle earth elementalists or fire elementalists."

dcss,2ub15d,mdw,2,Sun Feb 1 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"Are you using auto-skilling? Manual skilling is more important for a conjurations-slinging character than for a character that primarily uses weapons.  Usually, my formula for a caster is to select a level 3-5 spell from the starting book to be my primary way of killing monsters (Meph for a wizard, Battlesphere for a conjurer, obviously you can choose other spells, and race/apts will change what you go for)  I'll pick up the earliest weapon I can find (faster the better, but a good branded slow weapon can be of use) and use it to kill rats. Even at 0 skill, slings can be quite good. If I've got the spell points, I may pick up some defensive 'escape' spells here as well, especially if they're in line skillwise with what I'm already training. (Swiftness, Repel Missiles, Ozo's Armour, etc).   Once I have my 'big spell' online I will train some defenses (defensive spells count as things to be trained during this time, but don't neglect dodging, and some races will want a few points of fighting as well.) If you find a buckler, you can train it to the numbers here for some cheap SH with no casting penalties if you're in a robe. At some point you will also probably want to upgrade from a robe, especially if you're mostly casting lower-level spells. I often will don the first leather armour I see, especially on Wizards.  Once you're past here, it's crawl, so any guide will have diminishing returns. Gods, good weapons(enhancer staves count), evocables, bolt spells, so much will change what you will want to skill. Just don't neglect your defenses, and remember that you don't just have to be a spellblaster. I had a MfIE that found a dagger of distortion and ensorcelled hibernation, so I became a stabber, for instance.  Tactics: You don't have to kill everything. If you are squishy, run away early. Use your spells to help you escape, especially things that can block off corridors. Learn to pick a pack apart (carry stones to throw and get a monster's attention if you don't have a full range spell or a blowgun).  Good luck!"

Right now you want a lot more dodging, spellpower could be higher, but defense is more important right now I'd say.   Go dungeon down to 15, DONT dip into dephts, they are extremly deadly. Midgame changes to be aware of:  Snake has fire immune/resistant monsters, salamanders; snake has Naga sharpshooters, that use portal projectile to ignore EV, which is deadly for low AC/high EV chars. Snake also has shock serpents, which upon getting hurt do spark, deadly to low AC/high EV chars.   thorn hunters/mangroves in swamp are serious buisness. Shoals have aquamancers and water nymps, that also have huge, hard to avoid attacks (wave splash).  Armour: if you have no other source of rPois keep the robe for now, but yeah, keeping ?EA for the mystical PDA is a bad decision. I love troll leather, regen is awesome.

Yeah, I think you're ready :)  little note: haste and finesse ability do not stack when fighting so it is a waste of piety to use both unless you're preparing to retreat."
dcss,2u93f6,klockklock,1 point,Sat Jan 31 09:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going to play it safe, but I believe I can't die as long as I don't do something as stupid as tossing myself in the middle of a fight with a bunch of Greater Mummies without Necro on. I believe I can't use the scourge while in lich form, which is a shame, but the DW should do an egregious work of killing everything anyway. I have a +9 eveningstar of flaming, should that be better, but I think the DW's superior speed makes it better with all the slaying I have.  I thought haste and finesse stacked: I'll have to better read the weapon speed article on the wiki, assuming that's accurate. I still think finesse gives a better speed reduction and being able to walk faster is always a good thing, so I'm probably still doing it. Piety is basically free and I find myself without much use for the mana, after casting the initial buffs. I could probably switch out something for an AoE spell, but the low Int means I don't have ""infinite"" spell levels and Lv.9 ones are likely out of the question anyway.  Thanks for your opinion, anyway. I'll look into the haste+finesse thing.  By the way, I have a +5 plate with +3 Int and +6 Slay in my stash and the idea of putting it on looked fun, just to get even more slaying. Dropping from a +14 CPA didn't seem so wise, though, and now that I have the OCPA it's definitely not worth it. Would be fun, though, possibly in conjunction with the randart amulet I have in the same pile (Clar, +3 Dex, +5 Slay). I also have a +6 large shield with rF+, rC+, +2 Dex, but my current shield seems better anyway?"
dcss,2u93f6,klockklock,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"IF you want to use lichform, you can destroy the mummies just fine with that eveningstar or DW (both are very good doing the job). If you wanna use the scrouge, you can back up with silence spell so you don't get tormented if you keep close to the mummies. If you have dispel undead you can learn that (forget Shadow Creatures for it) and blast mummies with it. No matter what route you choose, you'll have ridiculously strong gear and the right spells to clear the Tomb with ease.  That large shield is very good but needs more skills. However, your current shield is better at least in the Tomb. If you wanna wear that later in the Hells, train shields while killing greater mummies."
dcss,2u93f6,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"What. With that much slaying the smaller min-delay of Dwhip is going to be phenomenally better than the evening star; and by leaps and bounds, holy is the best brand against vulnerable monsters. Sacred scourge, no question. And silence for this character is unnessecary."
dcss,2u93f6,klockklock,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"Well I really did not check the exact numbers for weapon damages (I don't know how to be sincere). Both tormenting mummies have rElec but no rF. I guess DW damage output is higher against them but 'phenomenally' higher? If someone can bring on the numbers, please post them or tell me how to count them. :)  Speaking of myself, I would not use necromutation a single time in the Tomb but clear it with the scrouge. But OP is obviously more afraid of mummy torments than I am and wants to use it. Without lichform I still would use silence in the Tomb:1 gauntlet, no matter how powerful char I'm playing. And i have never ever had this strong of an endgame character even though i have three digit amount of online wins."
dcss,2u93f6,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"well basically, base damage gets multiplied with stuff like bonus from weapon skill/fighting and brand, and then slaying gets added. Since eveningstar/Dwhip have about the same base damage 12/15 compared to 26! slaying, only delay is relevant. Thats 7 vs 5, meaning slaying gets applied 30% more often."
dcss,2u93f6,klockklock,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:02:05 2015 UTC,These are exactly the kinda gray area things in Crawl for me.

Thanks for your answer :)
dcss,2u93f6,klockklock,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:56:27 2015 UTC,"The scourge definitely deals ridiculous damage, but I'm still worried about torment. I guess that since this isn't a Ziggurat I can still walk away if I see two or more greater mummies, but wouldn't lich form allow me to basically walk unscathed through most of what the Tomb could throw at me? That seems like a huge defensive boost to me, despite the lower damage output of the whip.  If I were to use the scourge, how would I proceed to make sure I never drop in the danger zone? Bait one enemy at a time or something?"
dcss,2u93f6,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Sun Feb 1 09:08:54 2015 UTC,0.15.x version does have bennus that have holy attacks and unborns that can dispel undead.

dcss,2u9n1k,LipsAre,3,Sat Jan 31 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"In general, PDA is fantastic, one of the best AC for ER tradeoffs you can get.  It's basically plate armour that weighs as much as fire dragon/ice dragon armour, which is awesome (and with a pip of rN+ thrown in).  That said, with no armour training its benefit is limited, and you'd lose the amazing slaying on your robe.  I'd say there are three key questions you need to consider:   Which is a bigger problem for you, offense or defense?  In other words, when you get into a dangerous situation, is it usually because you're not killing things fast enough, or taking too much damage (typically on a troll it's the latter)? How much EV do you lose and AC do you gain if you equip it right now?  You'll need a pretty big overall defense boost to be worth losing 5 slaying for, you probably won't get it without some armour skill. Do you have any enchant armour scrolls?  Can you spare XP for armour training?  This goes with point 2.  If the armour doesn't give you enough defensive benefit to be worth it right away , then you have to consider how much investment it will take to be worth it, and whether that investment is itself worth it.  You'll get one extra AC per enchant armour scroll you use on it, up to +10 (so 7 scrolls).  You'll get 5/11 of an AC for every point of armour skill you get.   This is all ignoring deformed body and pseudopods, of course, which can come and go with Jiyva and hurt the armour considerably.  My personal inclination: I might not make it top priority, but you're probably not going to find a better use for enchant armour scrolls with your available aux slots pumped up (anything lighter probably isn't worth sacrificing slaying for,  anything heavier is probably not worth the extra investment (GDA and crystal plate are the only heavier things that actually give more AC anyway), so you can always enchant it up, try it out, and see what you think."

dcss,2u9n1k,Quazifuji,3,Sat Jan 31 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely not worth the loss right now.  The question is whether it will be worth the loss if you enchant it more (do you have any more scrolls?) and train more armour skill, and if so, whether that's worth the XP.  And to be completely honest, I'm not sure what the answer is.  My hunch, but it may be wrong, is that if you don't have any more enchant armour scrolls, you're better off training other skills in the short term.  In the long term, once your other skills are higher , that could change."

Slap that bad boy on and start training your armour skill until you have ~40 AC.  Slaying is great but getting decent AC is greater.  Also AC > EV because AC prevents more than just physical damage (and guaranteed damage reduction is a thing as well).

dcss,2u9n1k,pereza0,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust the wiki when it comes to esoteric info like that.  Use learndb (https://loom.shalott.org/learndb.html), ask people on irc or dive the source if you want really reliable info.  From learndb:   AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC.  Torment, smite, hellfire, electrocution, and a handful of other abilities/effects ignore AC. The only player-castable damage spells that ignore AC are freeze, refrigeration, sticky flame, static discharge, pain, vampiric draining, Olgreb's Toxic Radiance, ignite poison, and agony. Note that all of these spells also ignore EV.   The biggest advantage that AC has imo is that it is more forgiving than EV since it is more gradual while EV is binary.  A very high EV/low AC character won't get hit often but when he gets hit it hits like a truck.  This can easily get you killed.  A high AC/low EV character will get hit constantly but his health will lower more consistently.  This means you have a better idea of how you are doing during a fight which allows you to survive more mistakes."

dcss,2u8lxf,deadcelebrities,1 point,Fri Jan 30 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"Mh, your jewellry is a bit sub-par. Ash has not really a lot of use for amulet of faith unless you plan on doing major character redesign.  I'd rip it of and put on warding, thats still useless, but a bit less useless than faith.   You certainly have the INT for lvl 9 spells, and if you plan to get more than 6 runes you certainly can do it. I personally like Tornado a lot, but its really up to you and what spells/etc you have available. If you have silence/deflect missile thats a good reason to me to go tornado. If not, some other school might prove more useful."
dcss,2u8lxf,SvalbardCaretaker,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just put on the amulet of faith early on when I wanted to build piety quick so I could get some sweet skill boosts. I saw no need for warding or rMut so I didn't want to burn a scroll of remove curse for it. Why are deflect missile and silence particularly good with Tornado? The only reason I was thinking of doing it is because I already pumped my Air magic for Freezing Cloud."

I mean, training a single skill to get a single lvl 9 spell online is kinda stupid- so have a look at all the spells from that school you have, and if its not enough, consider carefully if theres a better alternative?  Extreme example would be if you found book of tempests early on, decided to get shatter online, and never found any of the other amazing earth spells."

dcss,2u7est,clamsarepeople2,3,Fri Jan 30 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"something worth noting is that a lot of the time you may want to leave your army on the floor above you, since recall is free and playing through an area on your own as muh as possible will help you get an accurate feel for your characters ability to handle the area on their own.   The trick with Yred is to ideally gain followers over time, and if you just can't get through a floor or a branch without significant losses it's generally best to find an easier area to level so you can maintain your army. Lots of my failed late-game yred runs were because I got my servants killed and realized I had nowhere safe to go on my own."
dcss,2u7est,clamsarepeople2,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip.  I typically don't play a lot of ally-based characters, so it's good advice.    Lately I've been taking a stab at Mummies of Yred, which is actually a pretty strong combo once you get rolling.  Usually my mummy attempts tend to falter transitioning from mid to late game (in a non-extended game).  But with Yred I find I can power through branches and vaults with relative ease.  In branches, you can lean on allies pretty heavily to mitigate mummies' slow leveling.  Of course, as you mention, I guess you probably have to worry about being underleveled at lower depths.  I lost my first good prospect in Zot when, descending the first staircase, I got caught between a tentacled horror and a couple elec golems--couldn't ascend or teleport and died pathetically.  Apart from that, I really thought I was set for a first mummy win on that one. I'm about 3 or 4 races away from winning all the races, Yred seems to be the easiest mummy game I've had."

I don't think spider gets any easier than with a yred worshipper, i've often had packs of 20+ high level spiders in the lower levels.   One of the most overlooked features of his (imo) is that you normally have fodder you can recall to put between you and any enemies on the ascension. I always try and have a few allies roaming each floor for that exact purpose, even if it's just a orc skeleton or something equally nonthreatening."

Don't know their mana costs offhand so I'm not sure which ones, but I'd focus more on getting more casts from a fully charged rod over charge rate, since you hopefully won't be needing to use them too much at once.  If you had a wand of haste, I'd consider saving recharging for that instead, but you don't and its probably not worth saving the scrolls just in case (normally heal wounds would also be a contender, but obviously not for a VS)."

dcss,2u3cr6,weezeface,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Strategy question: how good does a weapon have to be to get you to switch your primary weapon class?  If you've been training axes all game (let's say you have a +1 battleaxe of fire or something) and you pick this whip up, do you switch?"
dcss,2u3cr6,ccasin,3,Thu Jan 29 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"For a player trying to get their first win, my advice would be that you almost never switch. The main exception is finding a great weapon on an early floor before you've trained much.  This isn't to say that it's never a good idea to switch later on in a 3-rune game, but when you do that you really need a solid understanding of how long it will take to train it up, and what that will cost you in terms of training defences and auxiliary stuff that you maybe can't afford to lose.  Put simply, if you're not certain, keeping your current weapon base type is generally less likely to get you killed than switching weapon base types. Switching types might give you an edge, but it's almost never necessary. Switching types at a bad time or for a bad reason, however, can make a mess of your game."
dcss,2u3cr6,WinterShine,2,Fri Jan 30 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"Depends in part on how late-game you want to go, and what weapon type it is.  A Demon whip like that only needs 12 skill to hit min delay, so it is fairly easy to switch to in a short amount of time.  If I found an awesome artifact Executioner's Axe though, I'd only switch if I'm planning on a 15 rune game since it would take a ton of experience investment to swap over.  Lastly, I generally only swap weapons for something better than the best non-artifact weapon of my weapon type that I could concievably enchant, since I can usually rely on finding a weapon of that type eventually, along with a few branding scrolls and enchant weapon scrolls. (of course, if you find a decent artifact weapon before lair, swap regardless since you've barely accumulated any real exp by that point, so very little waste)"

Any time something gets a little tricky you can just pop up the teleport and wait to get to a new safe spot.

But dont sweat it, the way crawl xp works a 50 % XP loss is less bad that it sounds. XP levels and monster XP scales very steeply, so as you start killing monsters worth more experience the experience you lost killing other monsters through summons becomes quite insignificant. Summonings is also a very powerful school, quite effective even at low levels.  To illustrate this, to get to skill level 15 you need 74000 XP, half of that (killing everything you encounter in the game through summons, not dealing any damage yourself) would leave you at 37000 XP and about halfway through level 13. So a 50% experience decrease only translates to a loss of about a level and a half in this case, not too shabby. (This is also why negative aptitudes are not as bad as some people think they are, all this I just said is applicable to aptitudes if you replace kills-by-summons with -4 aptitude)  Also remember, you dont need to kil everything through summons and you can also support your summons in fifghts. Summons can be used very effectively as shields, escape tools, stallers and to fill squares that would otherwise have enemies. They are not just damage dealers.

Offence first if you need it, defence when you don't, auxiliary stuff last. You'll want to think about the Necronomicon spells once it won't take you a dozen floors of training in order to be able to use them.

S - the ring of Neurosis {rF- Slay+6 SInv}   (You found it on level 6 of the Pits of Slime)     This looks pretty good. Losing on the rF pip might be a slight issue, but you can always switch if there's nothing invisible and you need the resistance.  I believe you put your points in Str instead of Dex, which is a bit of a waste, so your defences are not as stellar as they might have been otherwise, but you should still be fairly good to go. More so with the boots giving you the option to run away from most stuff.  You could dip into Zigs, but you should likely leave after the first few floors: no resistance to torment and no clarity both hurt.  Not sure why you trained Long Blades: the Eudemon Blade is good, but without a shield it's definitely worse than the Executioner's, which increases your survivability by a ton. If you stay with Trog, it's just delayed maxed dodging and evocations. If you pick another god, it's likely just wasted experience.  About the switch, from hearsay I can tell you that Trog is viable, but the switch is reasonable too. TSO and Makhleb being good options.  Switching gives you access to some spells, but don't expect to have haste soon, with that GDA. Eventually it shouldn't be impossible, at 27 spellcasting and charms. The usual bunch of cantrips may be good even in the mid term, though.  Bear in mind Trog's penance may endanger you quite a bit in Pan, if you're unfamiliar with it, so there's that.  Anywho, I feel Pan is no harder than Slime, so I suggest to start with that and make your choice about deities before going in.  If you do get all Pan runes, you'll hopefully have some better stuff to tackle the Tomb. Which might easily kill you anyway, bear in mind.  The Hells are probably a pain, but the only time I got there I had an unstoppable death machine, so I can't really say much about that.  You can probably clear the Vestibule of Hell, btw. The Horn might even not be terrible, at such high Evo.  I think you should try and get a wand of hasting/healing, next time you acquire, btw."

If you've got enough strength to wear the armour you want, then the EV bonus from Dex will easily outweigh the benefits of strength.  A MiBe naturally has enough strength to wear whatever they want (the highest ER on any armour is 25 in 0.15 or 23 in 0.16),  so there's no reason to pump it more.  Also, in the particular case of minotaurs, Dex is better for your reflexive headbutt.  But in general, its rarely worth pumping str overall, and definitely not worth pumping str on characters that get naturally good str.  Also, you might be better off with the exec ace than the blade and a buckler.  Especially with the antimagic Axe.  Many people consider antimagic even better than holy wrath for extended, because the vast majority of the most dangerous threats are spells."

The hardest hitting spells in the game are firestorm (fire/conj), glaciate (ice/conj), tornado (air), and shatter (earth).   I'd pick between fire or ice magic and stick to that decision, but you can also focus on other schools. You have decent air magic so learning either summon lightning spire, ball lightning, or chain lightning could be worthwhile. I personally don't have much experience with those so I won't make a specific recommendation.  Keep some levels open, I'd say you're fine to learn a nice bolt spell for clearing hallway battles, and then make the decision about what to learn next when you have another book to look through. Other general advice: keep dodging training constantly, the aptitude is too good and without heavy armor you need the highest ev you can get. I'd also leave on spellcasting because  the aptitude is too good to pass up for deep elves. it will reduce hunger costs, let you memorize more, and gives you more of that precious mana"

dcss,2tp6ww,Seraphtheol,2,Mon Jan 26 09:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah that ring was great. I didn't get any new jewelry after the first few ziggs. Around #11 some interesting items started showing up, with like Int+12, but they were never ""clean"" (they always had rN- or Str-5 or some other poison pill).  I never found any amazing armor! That cloak was useful for strength (I was worried about stat loss) and the rN+ was in case my necro ran out during a silent level.  My next attempt is to take a break. I was home sick for a week, that's what enabled this epic run."
dcss,2tp6ww,fgriglesnickerseven,2,Mon Jan 26 17:22:57 2015 UTC,how does one acquire (>)27 beneficial mutations ? Must have been in all those zigs right?
dcss,2tp6ww,Eptagon,4,Mon Jan 26 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Ziggurats do have (relatively) a ton of those. Also, to even find 15 Zigs you have to stroll in Pan for a while.  If you save the potions for one big quaffing session you end up with quite a bunch.  In my 4 Zig run I always chugged those as soon as I found them, which might not have been efficient in that respect. I did get out with 20+ cure mutation potions, though, even though I was using them quite liberally.  Comparing with:     A - 158 potions of cure mutation I'd say that him finding around 30 potions of beneficial mutation isn't quite so surprising."
dcss,2tp6ww,jnmwhg,2,Mon Jan 26 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"Actually I immediately quaffed every pot of beneficial mutation I found until I got Clarity.

dcss,2tm54f,Blutrausch,11,Sun Jan 25 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"Razdak has the right of it. One of the key skills in Crawl is to recognize dangerous situations before they become really dangerous, and then to walk away from those situations. If you see an orc priest on an early floor, just walk back to a staircase and go up. Then find a different staircase and go back down where the orc priest isn't.  If you get caught in a bad situation (say you turn around a corner and there's an orc priest and an orc wizard just a couple squares away), and you can't just walk away, use items immediately, don't wait until low HP. Teleport is an option of course, but you might have other stuff too. Whenever you're in a dangerous situation, or even one that might be dangerous, open your inventory, and look at all your options. You can't hoard items in this game, you really have to use them. Don't forget your god's abilities too if you have one by that point.  And I want to add in one tactical bit of advice that might help keep you out of these situations to begin with: crate's law, I believe it's known as. This states that you should almost never walk towards an enemy in your line of sight. Instead, it's better to back up into a corridor, or even just back up several squares so you're not near unexplored territory. This makes it less likely that some other enemy will wander into your fight while you're dealing with the first one. If an enemy hasn't noticed you yet and you intend to fight it, toss a stone or something at it to get its attention, then back off. (Hitting it with a ranged weapon like a stone will actually prevent it from shouting too.)  tl;dr - Run from dangerous things, learn to use items early, and don't walk towards enemies in line of sight unless necessary."
dcss,2tm54f,WinterShine,8,Sun Jan 25 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"(Hitting it with a ranged weapon like a stone will actually prevent it from shouting too.)   People keep repeating it, but it's only true for wandering monsters, not sleeping ones. I was thoroughly confused what I was doing wrong until I read that exception."
dcss,2tm54f,genitaliban,4,Mon Jan 26 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"1) DCSS is designed so that picking a fight with everything will get you killed eventually. You can skip hard encounters and come back later when you're higher level to finish them. Each level has three up stairs and three down stairs, and you have access to lots of consumable healing and escape items.   2) Line of sight is what allows them to kill you. Don't walk across the room to fight a priest or mage, you'll get kited the whole time. Walk to where he can't see you, then find a corner to sit behind until he comes there to fight you. Mages and archers have trouble shooting their bolts through enemies, but priests can smite-target you no matter who is in the way. Worst-case scenario, use something like a scroll of fog to block line of sight to protect yourself."
dcss,2tm54f,thomar,3,Mon Jan 26 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"Run, part of a roguelike is to know when you aren't strong enough and survive to see another day. You can always come back and eviscerate them a little later in the game."

dcss,2tm54f,hdwilli3,8,Sun Jan 25 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"A strategy I always used if I got the attention of a huge group of orcs was just going back upstairs and coming down at another location. That pack will start to spread out and wander the level allowing you to encounter them at better locations.  Now of the early orcs with magic priests are the most dangerous. As they are approaching you they have a high chance of smiting you, your job is to get them into melee while not giving then a chance to smite. So when you see one go around a corner and just wait for it to pop around and then engage him."
dcss,2tm54f,Piginabag,2,Sun Jan 25 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Say you leave floor 3 right away because there's a priest, and go to floor 4. You kill a few geckos and quokkas, gain a level, then jump back upstairs and now you can kill the priest. Basically, if you can't kill something, avoid it until you can OR avoid it entirely."
dcss,2tm54f,bigmcstrongmuscle,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"You don't have to, but sometimes it's the right move. Levels in Crawl are big enough that a lot of times you can explore the whole rest of the level and not see them again. That said, stronger monsters give you SO much more xp that if you do skip to the next level, you aren't going to be outleveled for very long.  On the other hand, sometimes its a big clump of guys that are scaring you, and spending just a little time on another level gives them a chance to wander away from each other and allows you to pick them off in smaller groups. And sometimes you just need a few turns to regen to full strength."
dcss,2tm54f,ebrl,3,Wed Jan 28 12:11:57 2015 UTC,"If you see a plain orc when you still absolutely can't handle priests/wizards, then just assume that orc has a bunch of buddies in funny robes around the corner, and don't piss him off either.

dcss,2tm54f,klallamite,2,Mon Jan 26 00:08:36 2015 UTC,"Get away when you see trouble. You'll learn what's going to be trouble because it'll kill you.  If orc priests can't see you, they can't smite you, so use corners or stairs.  ID your scrolls each time you clear a level so that hopefully you'll have some escape options."
dcss,2tm54f,karlwayne,2,Sun Jan 25 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"Also, make sure you have manual skill training on and experience only going into your primary killdudes skill. It'll make the early game much more survivable."

Otherwise, running away, up a set of stairs then down another set of stairs, going another way around, etc. are all solid options."
dcss,2tlwi8,Downvoted_Defender,6,Sun Jan 25 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"If you use pastebin to upload your dump then people can look at it without having to download it.  Anyway, as far as where to go next: you say you've had bad experiences with the lair branches, but frankly, those are by far the least dangerous places available to you, so you'll have to learn to deal with them.  Depths is significantly more dangerous that spider or shoals.  It's also generally more dangerous than Vaults 1-4 (Vaults 5 tends to be worse than depths), but you can't do Vaults until you have a rune anyway, and the lair branches are by far the easiest two runes in the game, no contest.  So yeah, spider and shoals should be next, I'm sorry to say.  Spider is usually easier, but feel free to bail and try Shoals instead if it gives you trouble.  Clear 1-4 of each if then, then pick one to get the rune from.  Then you can move on to Vaults 1-4, then depths.  Also, you have too much short blades skill.  You only need 8 skill to hit min delay in a quickblade, any experience after that is generally better invested elsewhere.  I'd also recommend switching to a buckler instead of a full shield.  A regular shield is a big XP investment for a kobold, and probably not worth it, at least not this early (berserkers aren't too XP hungry so you might have enough so are XP for it later).  Right now, I'd make fighting, armour, and dodging your priority.  You could also consider getting a ranged weapon or evocations online if you wanted.  A crossbow, bow, or rod could help you kill things at a distance, or you could train throwing and get a blowgun and use needles for stabbing.  (Even without any throwing skill, I highly recommend bringing a blowgun and poison darts into spider.  It's an amazing way to deal with orb spiders, and not bad against most other things there as well.)  Finally, if you have at least 11 strength without those gloves, you should probably swap then for some plain gloves instead.  Strength doesn't do much besides help you wear heavy armour, and if you've already got enough strength for your armour (about as much as its ER), it's not very useful, while Dex is generally more useful.  Basically, check if those gloves raise or lower your EV.  If you have more EV without then than with then, then they're worse than a plain lair of gloves."
dcss,2tlwi8,Quazifuji,2,Sun Jan 25 13:05:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I breezed through spider (those darts were a god send vs orb spiders) and first 4 levels of Shoals (with some minor difficulty from Krakens). Currently on Vault 2 with no major issues so far.  How far into Depths should I go before I go back for Vault 5 or Slime? I have some corrosion resist.  Edit: Also related, currently I'm using a +9 quickblade of stabbing but I've also got a +6 sabre of electrocution. Which is the biggest dmg dealer on awake enemies?"
dcss,2tlwi8,Quazifuji,2,Mon Jan 26 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"How far into Depths should I go before I go back for Vault 5 or Slime? I have some corrosion resist.   Finish the depths if it doesn't get particularly nasty.  Some depths vaults or uniques can be really bad, but on average Vaults 5 is still harder than Depths 5.  Slime or Vaults for your third rune can be a tricky choice.  Corrosion resist helps a lot, but it can still be nasty.  Clarity (for golden eyes) and mutation resistance (for shining eyes) are also good therem  Abyss can also be a potential option.  It can be a pain, but if you're stealthy and have good sources of regeneration and mutation resistance it's sometimes the easiest third rune.  The individual battles in Abyss tend to be easier than Vaults 5 or Slime, the hard part is the endurance since you can't really rest there and sometimes it takes a while.   Also related, currently I'm using a +9 quickblade of stabbing but I've also got a +6 sabre of electrocution. Which is the biggest dmg dealer on awake enemies?   My hunch is the sabre.  Stabbing is a really bad brand on quickblades, since its damage is based on your weapon's base damage and quick blades have terrible base damage.  I'm not 100% sure, but my guess is that the sabre will do more damage on average, at least against enemies that aren't resistant to electricity."

I see you've found a few bookstores; do any of them have (delayed) fireball? That's usually the bread-and-butter spell of my fire mages, though Bolt of Fire could work too. Support-wise, Sublimation of Blood and Regeneration are quite useful; Deflect Missiles would be another nice upgrade if you can find it.  Orb of Destruction is another awesome spell; in the right circumstances it will take more than half health from some dangerous uniques like Mara, so I consider it a no brainer for any blaster mage. Dispel Undead might not be as important for fire mages, since few undead resist fire, but it is unavoidable and irresistable, so take it if you have spare spell levels.   You should probably focus on Fire Storm before any high level necromancy. That said, if you still don't find an amulet of resist mutation by the time you clear Depths, Crypt, Zot, and Slime, you would need Necromutation (you rot instead of mutating) and a supply of healing (to cure rotting).  Equipment-wise, that elemental staff is really good. If you can get a robe of the archmagi or ring of fire it might be worth swapping out the staff of conjuration for, though your resistances are already strong."
dcss,2tl5yv,sisforsawesome,2,Sun Jan 25 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Right now I use staff of conjuration as default but use that elemental staff as a switch item when I see anything that would benefit from the additional resists (for example, ogre mages, storm dragon, etc).  But good point, if I can find another spell enhancer, I should make the elemental staff my default weapon.  No robe of archmagi or ring of fire has turned up so far.  Haven't found Delayed Fireball anywhere yet, but I will take Fireball, Regen, and OOD for now.  When I'm ready for Crypt I'll amnesia Bolt of Draining and take Bolt of Fire.  Next skill focus:  Fire magic, with ultimate goal of getting Fire Storm online.  Once I get ready to memorize it I'l have to juggle some spells around.  Fortunately I have 5 Amnesia scrolls.  And thinking about it more, I have more game left than I though before I need rMut.  Depths 3-5, Vault:4, Crypt, Tomb, and even a Ziggurat if I'm still trying to find that rMut amulet (or at least scrounge some potions). If still no luck by that point, I'll either go the Necro route (never used it before), or just go for a 3- or 4-rune victory."

Unfortunately I didn't have an amulet of clarity, I was being very cautious in Spider, and I even considered leaving it alone and trolling vaults and depths for the precious clarity, but I had enough escape options that I was confident I could nuke a tarentella before it got adjacent. I had to teleport from Asterion and ended up adjacent to one from the teleport. :(  Player error played a part, but this still qualifies as one of the more frustrating instances of bad luck I've had.

dcss,2tjo0b,SvalbardCaretaker,2,Sat Jan 24 21:11:11 2015 UTC,so generally you take the pain cutlass if you can't find qb and just hope a necronomicon drops into your lap later on?
dcss,2tjo0b,Quazifuji,3,Sat Jan 24 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"You don't really need a Necronimicon for Kiku, especially if you're going for 3-5 runes (I just won a 4-rune game as a VpEn of Kiku with no Necronomicon, in fact).  A pain weapon, on the other hand, is a huge deal for a SpEn because it helps make up for the really crappy base damage of short blades and goes well with their speed.  So yeah, unless you find a different weapon that can compete, pain brand a quick blade as soon as you have one, or a cutlass as soon as you feel like you need more melee power if you don't find an early quickblade.  Train lots of necromancy and the pain brand or dispel undead should take care of most enemies, use undead summons for enemies that it's not enough for.  Use animate dead for mid game if you get it, try to get simulacrum online for late game if you can.  Request corpses costs very little piety, so don't hesitate to use it, even multiple times, if you need an army on the sport and don't have one.  Late game with high necromancy it'll often give giant and dragon corpses, and a couple corpses worth of giant or dragon simulacra is absurdly powerful.  Also, remember that undead are immune to poison and negative energy and very resistant to cold (simulacra and immune).  Some AoE cold, poison, or negative energy spells (bolt of draining, venom, or cold, poison or freezing cloud, ozocubo's refrigeration) can be used to attack enemies from behind your undead minions in situations where meleeing alongside them is unsafe.  Mostly, the key thing is that you should be using undead and pain brand to deal with situations where stabbing isn't effective.  It's the main reason Kiku is such a good enchanter god, often better than Dith.  He gives you the tools you need to kill enemies you can't stab.  Overall, request corpses and pain brand are Kiku's best features.  So if you're not taking full advantage of those, that may be your problem."

dcss,2tjo0b,Stiegurt,2,Sat Jan 24 22:40:56 2015 UTC,"I've barely really used it.  It has the advantage of the pets being able to take stairs, but it's also a lot more hassle than animate dead, and the power of the summons doesn't scale as much with enemy power.  Also, zombies being unable to take stairs doesn't matter as much with a Kiku worshipper because you can get an on-demand zombie army in two turns with request corpses if you need some before you've had the chance to build up some minion on a level.  So I think overall, animate dead might be a bit better, but I can't really say since I don't have much experience with twisted resurrection.  It's certainly a reasonable alternative if you don't have animate dead, at the very least.  It's a good spell, the biggest downside is just that managing your army and making sure they follow you up and down stairs when you need them to is a pain."

Petrify stabs work well too--despite the reduced damage you get multiple guaranteed stabs, which you can't do with hibernation or confuse. Petrify is also harder to resist.  Later, Ash helps you get the high level earth conjurations online, which is otherwise difficult with a -3 aptitude.

You certainly can do fine playing with Kiku and relying on that set of skills, but you're going against the flow. Maybe you should try Dithmenos and focus your spellcasting on Hexes/Charms/Translocate (aptitude 2/4/4 respectively) along with Stealth/Dodging (aptitude 5/4)? That style can absolutely get you the two lair branch runes and Vault, and lead to a win. The only monsters you'd struggle with would be high MR / unnatural demons, and you can mostly avoid those in a 3 rune win.  I'm not saying you can't play a Necromancer Spriggan, but if you're having trouble with the SpEn, maybe focus on the core skillset and only vary from it if you get somethings crazy good from the RNG.

I died on floor 10 or 11, so it wasn't exactly deep, but two Tormentors plus other stuff to shield them from my rocks and deal the last tad of damage did the trick.

dcss,2ti6f0,mdw,1 point,Sun Jan 25 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"As for Slime, throwing large rocks at skill 21 is adequate. I'd suggest throwing rocks at TRJ once or twice, then read immolation to inner flame all the TRJ spawns and then set off explosions. This will most likely kill TRJ just fine. Going without rCorr can be bad, though. You have DMsl which helps greatly for acid blobs, but at lousy power.  I don't think you will get Statue Form to useful shape, your Int is too low to get reasonable spellpower.  I think you should keep one wand of hasting in case you're low on MP or get silenced. Also, how long does haste last at such 3# spellpower? It must be rather short I'd guess.  Don't bother with Invisibility, it's useless for anything but stealthy stabbers.  BTW, the whole spellcasting thing seems like a waste of experience for your char. Your intelligence is so low, that the spells are very very weak. You should have trained evocations instead and use evocables. They are rather powerful and versatile (invisibility, teleportation, hugely damaging elemental evocations, powerful rods...)."

There are lots of spells that don't depend very much on spell power, such as haste, deflect missiles, spectral weapon and (controlled) blink.

Spirit is getting less useful, with the huge HP pool and an actual use for mana, so I think I'll go get the +5 Int +1 Dex hat I left somewhere in the dungeon and wear that.  Rods I don't really feel confortable with, yet. I usually take them for a stroll, realize I'm never using them since I have other stuff to do at range, drop them. Also, I almost never feel like enchanting them because I want to keep the recharging for /heal. Having flight, haste, DMsl and spectral weapon up all feel like good assets, anyway, not sure I'd want Evo instead.  I kinda want Invisibility ""eventually"" for draconian Zig floors, assuming I don't get bored first and just go for the win, but that's definitely not a priority.  I'll do slime and postpone the shields decision, then. I'd like some suggestions about that.  Edit: Yup, Slime was easy.

If you are spreading your XP more than me, you can expect that ability to cast level 9 spell will be even more delayed -- and that means you might not have it ready for that big unique panlord battle.  For blink you do not need much if any skill. For DMsl I actually never trained any Air Magic, just got Charms to around 12 (which you need for Haste anyway). Since you only cast this spell when you're not in combat, the fail rate is irrelevant and Sif Muna protects you from miscasts.  I feel the name of the game for mummies is tight focus. With apts at -2 for everything you can't afford to train multiple schools (I only trained Evo in Zot because I was vulnerable to ghost moths and had +Inv ring, I got only minimal Necromancy to be able to get Dispel Undead for Crypt, I trained minimal Earth to get Iron Shot reliable).

I dare to say way more than 9 hitpoints per even moderately tough fight. And for this char also rF > Str-3. So put it on.  TSO invo skill.. Haven't played TSO a lot.

Few turns later of intense rock throwing, I was dead. :) Just thought it was funny, don't wanna to complain or something."
dcss,2tg4a9,WinterShine,3,Fri Jan 23 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"4hp is way too late to be trying to get out of a fight. You should be running away before you've hit half health.

You could also have quaffed a potion of invisibility (or evoked your cloak, if you had a good enough success rate).  I tend to die in stupid ways too, so I need to get better, but one should always check his whole inventory when in a hairy situation.  I don't think the -3 gloves are worth it, despite the +Blink. Also, you should have had some dodging by that point. Not sure how much Invocations you need to make good use of Makhleb's powers, but 22 seems a bit overtrained given that you had 0 dodging and 11.7 fighting.  If you start with Axes you should basically never train SH, btw. I mean, you could find Arga, but outside that you're most likely to go 2H. And there's absolutely no reason to go above 5 Shields if you only have a buckler, anyway.  I see you went in Spider, but I don't see the Rune. Did you get to Shoals without grabbing the thing first?

Maybe you can explain? I trained shields, because this was first game in a long time where I could not find any of the strong axes, so I was using +6 poisoned war axe for a long time.

dcss,2tdmzk,mdw,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"My advice:  You should drop Cigutuvi's embrace and apportation for haste. Cigotuvi's embrace doesn't work on the most dangerous floors (mummy floors, pan lord floors, etc.) and not every floor can paralyze you (e.g. mummy floors, holy floors), so having haste is useful for those.   I'd drop the Majin-Bo in favour of a staff of conjuration. You'll still have all of your conjurations pretty much at max power, since that's achieved at 50 int with two enhancers, and the difference 6 int makes won't matter that much because of diminishing returns. Alternatively, you could wear the Hat of the High Council and always wield Wucad Mu, which would save you time switching staves. Chain lightning isn't terribly useful compared to glaciate and firestorm when there are so many monsters to absorb the arcs. I'd drop chain lightning in favour of revivification or iron shot/crystal spear. The latter two spells aren't particularly useful at this point when you could use glaciate and hit more monsters, admittedly, but revivification could save your life. Pick up the staff of Dispater. It's AMAZING for Makhleb characters in Ziggs.   Here's my 6-Zigg NaWz if you want some ideas:  http://dobrazupa.org/morgue/ManMan/morgue-ManMan-20141102-003718.txt"

""Haste"" has always been one of my bedrock spells, but for this game I'm keeping on my amulet of Stasis. I certainly don't need it on every level but I don't like swapping jewelry in the middle of a fight (and not being slowed, paralyzed, or zerked is more important than being fast). Of course I couldn't do this until I got the Clarity mutation.  Cigotuvi is not a ""must have"" spell, but I like the fact that it destroys corpses (so they can't be reanimated). This just makes the fight go faster."

dcss,2tczqm,bluebugs23,4,Fri Jan 23 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're ridiculously overtraining that shield. 15 is enough to get rid of the penalty and it's not worth the xp for you to train it all the way to 25 for a large shield.  A bit late for that, but if I were to pick a character that needs a shield the least, a gargoyle of qaz would be very high on the list, if not the top one. You already get repel and buckler-like SH for free and you get armor bonuses to rely on. That makes shields a bit redundant when you can very easily get 60+ AC, grab a two-handed weapon a go kill the enemies more quickly. Especially since you're otherwise a purely melee character (which isn't really a problem though, GrGl of Qaz without spells is playable, although a bit more challenging).  Also, your piety is pretty low. That either means that your use of invocations is way too liberal or that your character is losing breath, in which case you should really consider a better armor. I'd advise you to always try to keep your piety at least around 6* and never let it drop below 5* unless you're fighting for your life, not just for convenience. The reason is that you want to be ready to invoke a disaster area (or two) at any times. It's the best panic button you can ask for.  If you decide not to extensively pursue magic though, I'd actually consider training invo as far as you can. Even a simple disaster can be devastating when your invo is 25+, even in extended."

dcss,2tczqm,unknownvar-rotmg,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"Also, Light armor seems to work well for my character, should I bother with a few spells?   Gargoyles have decent magic aptitudes, so if you've got some experience to spare and you're in light armour then at least grabbing some low level utility spells like blink or stoneskin is worth it (some of the standard good low-level utility spells are useless with Qaz, though, like summon butterflies, animate skeleton, or repel missiles).  You could even go for higher level things like CBlink, Deflect Missiles, or Haste if you wanted to.  Conjurations are probably redundant with Qazlal overall and any sort of summon will just get hurt by your clouds.  In general, if you're not planning to do much spellcasting heavy armour is usually better than light armour, although for a gargoyle that might be a bit less true since you have ridiculous AC anyway.  I agree with Infamously_Unknown that this character would probably be better off with a 2-hander instead of a shield, since as a Gr of Qaz you already have naturally great defenses, but you'll do just fine as is.   Is there anything else worth training up (or stopping)?   Armour skill is good, but it's effect is pretty tiny in leather armour (it boosts your AC by 1/22 of your armour's base AC, so in leather you get about 1 AC per 7 armour skill).  Although, personally, I would probably get some heavier armour instead of stopping my armour training, since your strength is so high (the main benefit of strength is to reduce the penalties of heavy armour).  Maybe not go super heavy, but some medium weight armour could be nice.  If you've gotten lucky enough to find some pearl dragon armour, that's my personal favorite armour in the game and would be great for a character like this (it's got the same base AC as place but the same encumberance rating as fire or ice dragon armour, and gives rN+ and no penalty to any resistances).  If you've found any rods or elemental evokers (phial of floods, fan of gales, and lamp of fire are amazing), evocations could be good.  If not, I don't know if it's worth it just for wands.   Also not sure where to go from here, I was going to just plunder the depths.   Depths or Crypt.  I usually do both before Vaults 5, personally, with 3 runes those are definitely the next steps.  Crypt will only get loot and experience, not essential, but it shouldn't be too dangerous if you're not careless.  Depths can be nasty, but you should be prepared for it if you can handle Vaults 5.  If you're only planning to go for 3 runes (and if you've never won before, I recommend it), I'd maybe do Crypt, then just dive down through depths and Zot and win the game."

dcss,2taqxq,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"With this sort of character, like a Minotaur, I tend to train armor and shields to around 5 then put everything into Axe and Fighting and enough invocations to be helpful until Axe and Fighting hit 20. Then I train everything else up.   But it's been years since I played an Orc following Beogh and I now recall that you have to tank damage for your followers until they transform. And then you REALLY have to tank for them. So I think I'll train to 15 in both then get armor up."
dcss,2taqxq,HPLoveshack,2,Thu Jan 22 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"Because of the diminishing returns on experience, you'll probably get more out of training armour before axes and fighting hit 20.  But it depends on what weapon and armour you have too.  Armour skill is better with high base AC armour, and training axes to 20 isn't worth it until you've found a battleaxe (although you often will by then).  You might be underrating armour skill and overrating the offensive bonuses of fighting overall.  Fighting's usually considered more of a defensive skill (for raising HP) than an offensive one."

dcss,2t9uze,1987Catz,3,Thu Jan 22 09:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, some of those notable kills aren't really that notable. OFC, some others are. For instance, Duvessa and Dowan are not typically trouble. Blork is usually pretty easy. Eustachio is a joke.   On the other hand, The Royal Jelly is no mean feat at all, and Rupert and The Enchantress are both guilty of murdering many players. As for the seventeen headed hydra... I can only assume you beat it to death with your giant brass balls.  For the slime pits, with .15 (or maybe trunk still) corrosion is not permanent, so you don't have to worry as much about it as you used to.  As for taking a break/wizard mode, that's all fun. Or you could just try playing a different style of character. A few character types I'd suggest for getting a different experience would be: Spriggan or Vampire enchanter, Ogre Hunter, Orc of Beogh (any class, lava orc if your version has 'em!), Deep Elf blaster mage, or Demonspawn Abyssal Knight."
dcss,2t9uze,Fambida,4,Thu Jan 22 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, some of those notable kills aren't really that notable. OFC, some others are. For instance, Duvessa and Dowan are not typically trouble. Blork is usually pretty easy. Eustachio is a joke.   An ice beast is also one of the least dangerous things you can find in an ice cave.  Those can sometimes contain ice dragons, ice giants, or even ice fiends long before you're usually ready to deal with such enemies.   For the slime pits, with .15 (or maybe trunk still) corrosion is not permanent, so you don't have to worry as much about it as you used to.   This is very dangerous advice.  You don't have to worry about ruining your equipment in the long term anymore, but corrosion is much, much more dangerous in the short term than it used to be.  So instead of missing rCorr meaning your equipment will get damaged in slime, it means you're vastly more likely to die.  I'm not sure if that makes rCorr less of a concern there than it used to be.  If you've got a character strong enough to take on TRJ without corr then it's nice, but that requires a very strong character."
dcss,2t9uze,Quazifuji,2,Thu Jan 22 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"or even ice fiends   Yeah, there's one layout that throws three blue devils, an ice fiend and two ice statues at you only in the first room. Then two sets of the same monsters in glass rooms and about ten strong simulacra behind closed doors.

dcss,2t9uze,Quazifuji,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really wish deities besides the good ones had varying wrath based on who you switch too.  I mean, Trog should be extra pissed if you switch to a magic god, and vice versa. Jiyva should be extra pissed is you switch to Zin. Mahkleb and Lugonu seem like buds, what with one having a focus on demons, and the other ruling the freakin abyss. Kiku, Yred, and maybe Dithmenos could all have less wrath for switching between 'em. Sif and Ashenzari could get along since they both have a knowledge theme.  Wrath as it currently stands seems like an unneeded penalty a lot of times. It's one thing to discourage switching, but the way it is now, as you said, it's almost never a good idea."
dcss,2t9uze,Fambida,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a problem that times when it's worth switching are rare.  I see god selection as a part of character creation, as much as choosing your race and background (sometimes it bugs me that people often describe their characters solely by race and background and ignore god, considering how big a deal it is - my VpEn of Kiku is probably more different from a VpEn of Dith than he is from a SpEn of Kiku).  You can't change your race at all, I don't mind that changing your god is very difficult.  I like that picking your god is a major choice that defines your character, and nerfing god wrath would diminish that.  Anyway, the gods that you have the most reason to abandon (i.e. gods that lose a ton of power in extended) tend to have the tamest wraths."

You may also want to take a look at HDA's autopickup here: https://github.com/HilariousDeathArtist/DCSSConfigFile/blob/master/HilariousDeathArtist.txt  It's a bit buggy and outdated (doesn't pick up useless items at all like Ambrosia if you have clarity equipped, and picks up all curare assuming that enemies could use it), but there are some nice ideas in his rcfiles.

dcss,2t45or,sir_pirriplin,8,Wed Jan 21 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"There are two main ways to be sent into the abyss. The first is a 25% chance to be banished on hit from a distortion weapon (or 5% chance from a chaos weapon - beware Crazy Yiuf). The second is when certain enemies cast banish on you successfully.  Distortion weapons are probably the harder one to deal with for you. In the latest versions of crawl (it might be trunk, the latest 'beta') you can see all the brands of weapons wielded by enemies, so if you're paying some attention you can identify distortion equipped enemies early on. Other ways to know is if you (or an ally) get hit by a runed weapon, a distortion effect occurs such as blinking, teleportation, or space warping around you. Once you know an enemy has a distortion weapon, you can dispatch them safely via wands, BiA, berserk etc. Treat enemies with unknown runed weapons with caution. If they're a weak enemy, prioritise killing them; if they're a strong enemy, use berserk/BiA. Certain enemies tend to have distortion weapons: Sonja, Psyche. Other ways to avoid distortion is to simply limit your exposure: have a strong mindelay attack, don't neglect dodging, and don't fight more than one enemy at a time.  The banishment spell is castable by only a few enemies: deep elf sorcerers and demonologists, ogre mages, wizards, liches, ancient liches, Louise and Erolcha. Most of these enemies you don't bump into often outside of elven halls, vaults and the depths. Probably the most dangerous is Erolcha, who can appear very early on. On sight of any of these enemies, you should use Trog's Hand if your MR isn't extremely high, and then proceed to escape or kill them swiftly. The banishment spell requires clear line of fire, and so it can be blocked by other enemies or allies. Hence BiA can work well, and other tactics such as hiding behind other enemies and using wands to kill the enemy that can banish you.  If you get banished when you're still quite weak (< xl 15 or so) it's usually death, especially for newer players. It's best to prevent banishment, but if it happens anyway, keep exploring and use a consumable or an ability (BiA) to escape threats. I like to keep a teleportation ring when I find one for this purpose."
dcss,2t45or,zxc223,2,Wed Jan 21 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"Speaking of nice features in trunk that help avoid banishment: I'd you examine an enemy with x v in trunk, you can press different keys to look at any of their spells, and if you look at any that are resistable with MR, it will show their chance of hitting you.

dcss,2t590a,Jackthecabe,2,Wed Jan 21 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"I believe the GDA is definitely better than the Plate.  I would be on the lookout for a better weapon: maces are terrible base weapons. It does have a +10 enchantment and a bunch of resistances, but you should be better off with an eveningstar or the demon whip I see in your inventory, even though the latter doesn't let you fully employ your weapon skill. If you don't have an eveningstar, I'd consider just enchanting up the whip. If you do, I'm not sure which one is better, given you already have 18 weapon skill.  A DW of Elettrocution seems like a pretty good weapon, anyway.  Also, train some dodging? It won't do anything until a certain level, but above that it will be gold. More so if you dump all your points in Dex. I'd turn everything else off and focus on that.  I also see you're training a lot of skills at the same time; I believe general wisdom is to only train one-two things at a time, as a rule of thumb. It's definitely helped me do better.  I think you're fine for Elf 3, but that's a rather dangerous place. You do have obscene magic resistance, even without the mace, so the Abyss shouldn't be a real threat, but you probably want better defences (id est, dodging) and I'd advise extreme caution anyway, at least in the treasure vault area.  You have great equipment anyway, so I'm not sure that you'd get anything better there.  Otherwise, if you have rCorr (and possibly rMut) you could do Slime. On the issue of mutations:  14119 | Lair:2   | Gained mutation: Your muscles are strong. (Str +2) [potion of mutation] 14119 | Lair:2   | Gained mutation: You are robust (+10% HP). [potion of mutation] 14119 | Lair:2   | Gained mutation: You possess an exceptional clarity of mind. [potion of mutation]   This is a fairly unlikely result from a potion of mutation: what happens usually is horrible, horrible crippling. I'm not going to call shenanigans, but unless one is cheating or has a lot of cure mutation, I'm fairly sure one shouldn't quaff potions of mutation. Good news that it worked out so well for you, but I'd not do it again.  If you don't have rCorr, you can probably clear the Crypt (Tomb may be a bigger issue, though, and is likely more dangerous than Elf 3) and probably do Vaults too, but I'll let someone else give you better insight on rune order.  53832 | Depths:3 | Identified the ring of Mnabib {+Rage AC+3 Str+4 Dex-3 Slay+4 Stlth+} (You took it off an orc warrior on level 2 of the Depths)   I'm fairly sure you should be wearing this instead of the ring ""Gegeibri"" {rF+ rC++ Dex+3}. Four slaying is a lot and in GDA you're going to have rF++ and rC++ anyway. rC+++ is only maybe necessary in Cocytus (and ok in Ice Caves and the like, I guess) and rF+++ is something you only really want agains Orbs of Fire. +4 Slaying on the other hand is great and +Rage is not terrible (Heroism+Finesse+Zerk seems like it could take down pretty much everything), while everything else kinda balances out. If you end up using the DW, having +11 Slaying seems excellent.  Bear in mind the first pip or resistance is the most important (since it halves elemental damage) and with two you're likely fine even in highly focused areas (Volcano, Ice Cave).  By the way:  You drop 4 scrolls of enchant armour. You drop 4 scrolls of remove curse.   Are you keeping a stash? I don't thing that's necessary anymore, in 0.15 and above... It does help keep a clean inventory, but when your inventory is bloated you're probably doing fine anyway.  All in all I think you have a pretty good chance of winning and even grabbing more than 3 runes if you want to (but I'd stick to 3 for the first win), so, good luck with that."
dcss,2t590a,Eptagon,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:37:10 2015 UTC,"I would be on the lookout for a better weapon: maces are terrible base weapons. It does have a +10 enchantment and a bunch of resistances, but you should be better off with an eveningstar or the demon whip I see in your inventory, even though the latter doesn't let you fully employ your weapon skill.   I am only using the mace because of the ridiculous enchantment. I still have all of my enchant weapon scrolls because I wasn't sure where to use them however if the whip is a good target for them I can get it to +9. I am not sure what you mean about it not employing my weapons skill, whips fall under the maces and flails category so it should already be at min delay.   Also, train some dodging? It won't do anything until a certain level, but above that it will be gold. More so if you dump all your points in Dex. I'd turn everything else off and focus on that.   I read somewhere that in heavy armor it is basically useless. I guess I was misinformed.   This is a fairly unlikely result from a potion of mutation: what happens usually is horrible, horrible crippling. I'm not going to call shenanigans, but unless one is cheating or has a lot of cure mutation, I'm fairly sure one shouldn't quaff potions of mutation. Good news that it worked out so well for you, but I'd not do it again.   This happened because I ran out of ID scrolls and had one unIDed potion left in my inventory and thought that it most likely wasn't a potion of mutation. It was, but I got very lucky. Definitely not something that I make a habit of.   Bear in mind the first pip or resistance is the most important (since it halves elemental damage) and with two you're likely fine even in highly focused areas (Volcano, Ice Cave[3] ).   Did not know this, thanks.   Are you keeping a stash? I don't thing that's necessary anymore, in 0.15 and above... It does help keep a clean inventory, but when your inventory is bloated you're probably doing fine anyway.   Why is it not necessary? It's just somewhere that I can leave all my items that I do not need immediately, such as enchantment scrolls, so that they can all be in one place if I need them. My inventory is too full to just carry them around all the time.  Thanks for the solid advice, hopefully it'll help me get my first win."
dcss,2t590a,Eptagon,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"The DW is a great weapon, with a very good enchantment (the flat damage from elec is likely better than flaming or freezing on such a fast weapon). What I mean with the weapon skill statement is that you hit min delay at just 12 maces and flails skill, so the extra points only add some damage. You eventually want to max out the skill, but only after you've invested in a lot more stuff, so the extra points feel ""wasted"". That said, I'm not sure an eveningstar would be a better weapon (maybe against foes with high AC?) and a morningstar would definitely be worse. An eveningstar hits min delay at 16, so I wouldn't train M&F above that anyway until I've got considerably higher scores in fighting and all my defences, if I plan to go 1H+Shield.  The first levels of dodging do nothing, in heavy armour, but after that it starts to work as intended. Also, your EV score keeps benefitting from Dex, while Str has diminishing returns after slightly above your body armour's EV penalty, so as a Minotaur you should dump all your points in Dex (and possibly some Int, if you want spells online? Not sure, possibly unnecessary). Not sure about the exact values, but that's what I gathered in this subreddit and then experienced first hand in my games.  I suck at inventory management, but after switching from 0.9 it's way easier. Everything used to have a weight that could cause encumberance, fruits took an insane amount of slots, item destruction was a thing and the dungeon floor was a lot less safe.  Dropping enchantment scrolls could make sense, but they're safer in your inventory (where no jellies can spawn) and if you find some you're using up the slot again, so there are pros and cons. Plus, I loathe going back and forth. : )  So, in short, keeping a stash is possibly an unnecessary endeavor.  By the way, if you find Crystal Plate or if Oka gifts you some nice artifact body armour, that could be better than the GDA."
dcss,2t590a,Quazifuji,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"Might give more detailed advice based on the dump later, but a quick answer: Vaults 1-4 tends to be easier than the depths.  It's very similar enemies, but fewer of the harder ones (Vaults has an occasional dragon or giant while depths has then everywhere).  You'll also find the Crypt in the Vaults, which usually isn't too hard and gives some XP and loot.  Vaults 5 is usually harder than anything in depths, though, so I'd finish Depths before going there."

Your current items and muts are amazing. Get a nice artefact body armour or rF+ plate (or use the GDA but you don't exactly need the resists) and use up all the enchant armour scrolls. Start training only dodging until it's about 18 or so. Look for other amulets, such as rMut or a randart. Enchant that demon whip of elec you have to max and use it immediately. Make sure you have a minimum of one pip of rF and rC, but further pips aren't very important."

Your defenses are good, vault:5 with torment should work- just quaff all of the buffs before you go down, agility, might, brilliance possibly etc. Its a relatively quiet way to do the ambus.   Extended: without healing thats a big no no. If you have yet to get a third rune and clear zot, 3 charges of /HW is cutting it close and will allow you NO fuckups.

I forgot to mention I also have haste at 4%, so kiting and splitting them up should be really easy. edit: yeah khufu was a piece of cake. Fighting his greater mummies one a time was trivial, and Khufu himself only got a couple smites on me for just a few damage apiece. Haunt and dispel undead messed him up.  Extended: Dang, that's not really what I was hoping to hear. How much healing would you say I'd need to make Pan and Hell viable? Every scroll of recharging I find is equivalent to 4-6 charges of wand, and I actually have a treasure trove with I'll likely open (it takes 8 potions of haste, but I know the haste spell). I've cleared elven halls, so there's none there, but I still have Vaults 5 and slime pits vaults for potions/scrolls/shops to get that 3 charges up. Scumming the abyss is also a very real option for me, as there should be enough creatures for me to vampiric drain to keep my health up (plus haste will let me run away from things I can't fight/drain) so I can find potions of health and scrolls of recharging there.

In any given fuck-up youll need 4-6 charges before you are either dead or a teleport goes off. So if you have cleared zot:5 and have 4-6 left you are alright-ish...

Relying on nothing but consumables and the occasional vampiric drain isn't really a viable strategy, and scumming the Abyss for enough consumables will crush your soul and destroy your will to live. If you decide to go for it anyway, then you'll want to avoid fights as much as possible and ninja the runes. Controlled Blink, Death's Door and Borg's are very useful if you go that route. If you decide to go Makhleb, then you'll have to deal with Kiku's wrath. I've never abandoned Kiku myself so I don't know what it entails. If I had to guess (too lazy to look it up), it involves undead, obnoxious necromancy miscast effects and lots of torment. Tbh I'd just get 3 runes and book it.

dcss,2swka7,clamsarepeople2,2,Mon Jan 19 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"I'm personnally in favour of converting for extended. While Trog is good enough for extended, gods like TSO and Makhleb are better. Why? Let's do a side-by-side comparison of granted abilities:   Rage: Haste + might is covers this. Yes, you won't get the extra HP, and might can only be used in the most dangerous fights, but it has the advantage of lasting longer and not slowing you at the end. In particular, raging against the high-HP endgame bosses like Cerebov or Antaeus is generally a bad idea because they will likely outlast your rage, and raging in Hell is unsafe because you can't safely rest to wait off the slow effect. You'll likely have enough might for all of the endgame bosses and a few other dangerous fights anyway. Trog's Hand: The main advantage of this in extended is the regeneration, and there's a spell for that. TSO forbids the use of regeneration because it's necromancy, but heals on kills is nuch better anyway IMO. Makhleb gives both heals on kills and allows regeneration. The MR is admittedly nice for this character since yours is junk; if you do do extended, make sure to wear at least one more source of MR to avoid having a Pan Lord paralyse you, or make liberal use of Trog's hand if you stay with Trog. Brothers in Arms: TSO and Makhleb both give better summons for this point in the game. Weapon gifts: You already have great weapons from staying with Trog for so long. TSO in particular lets you bless an executioner's axe with holy brand, which is much for extended than any other brand (yes, even speed).   So while there are some advantages to Trog in extended, for the most part TSO and Makhleb do it better. In addition to these benefits, you can get utility spells like blink, control teleportion, repel/deflect missiles, etc. online - yes, even in GDA with low int and aptitudes - and dispite this being a fairly large investment, it's well worth it since your other important skills are (nearly) maxed out anyway.  Anyway, with those arguments being said, if you're not sure that you want to continue, just get your win. I especially suggest getting this win if you haven't won before; and if you have, just follow what your gut tells you. And like Cheibrodos said, Trog is a fine (if inferior to some other gods) god for extended, so if you really want to continue with him, you can definitely get 15 runes. Good tactics reign supreme in Crawl anyway, which is why good players can win with weak combos like MuCK despite them being clearly inferior to combos like your MiBe."
dcss,2sugy8,ryeoldfashioned,5,Sun Jan 18 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, but, since the speed club relies on multiple hits to do it's damage, all the damage you do is reduced by AC twice. So, it may (depending on the target) end up dealing less damage than the flaming club.  That said, for a high-damage weapon (where enemy AC is less of a concern to start with) speed brand is insanely strong, and is (usually) better than any other brand. It's much more of an issue for low base damage weapons."

dcss,2sugy8,Quazifuji,3,Sun Jan 18 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"As Baloroth said, the main downside of speed is enemies with high AC.  AC is a flat reduction on damage, not a % reduction, so hitting more often for less damage cab be weak against high AC enemies.  The harder your weapon hits, though, the less enemy AC matters, so since giant clubs and giant spiked clubs have such high base damage, yeah, speed is probably the brand that will give you the biggest damage boost on those outside of enemies weak to holy wrath.  Speed does tend to be a crappy brand on low-damage weapons like short blades, however.  Short blades of speed are awesome against very low AC enemies, but terrible against high AC ones.  On short blades, it's better to have a flat damage brand like electrocution, or sometimes pain or distortion, to get enough bonus damage to overcome enemies with good AC and to take advantage of the weapons' already good attack speed.  There's also vampiric and antimagic, which are ridiculously strong defensive brands, so the comparison gets more complicated there."

Otherwise you have to branch out spellwise (generally I suck it up and take the XP hit and go conjurations/air) or put your trust in your god of choice. Weirdly enough, Zin can set up a lot of stabbing chances, as can Ru. Dithemenos is kind of doubling down on stealth, but the controlled blink chain stabs can be wonderous to behold... until everything wakes up of course. But then he provides some attack/spell doubling and an escape form I always forget to use until it's too late."

I mentioned elsewhere on the thread my HOFi of Zin who died on Ziggurat:19, blasted by hellfire by elves while running for the exit, killed just a couple of steps away.

Blowguns, throwing, and status needles. You can stab the four unique pan lords this way with enough throwing and needles of paralysis! Transition into conjurations if you found good books Use enslavement on the low MR guys, and then let them kill the high MR guys for you. Summons and/or necromancy (might as well make use of all those corpses, and Spriggans have a decent Necro apt). Wands/Rods/Evokers + evocations skill. You have a great aptitude, and these can be powerful if you find them and use them at high Evo skill.   Basically, at some point you have to look at all the junk the dungeon has given you and decide, ""Which of these things am I going to use to clear the rest of the game?"" Maybe it's rods and evokables, or magic, or maybe you found a sweet demon whip... whatever the case might be. Don't forget to check what options shops are giving too (you can press ctrl-f in game and even search for ""shop"" if you want).  Experts will argue that you never have to stop stabbing, and they're likely right. But you're also not required to stick to that route. Crawl is a game of adapting. When things start to get tough, sit back, examine all your options, pick the best one, and go forward. (And when doing so, keep in mind the golden rule: strategize for what you need to survive now, not for what you'll be doing much later.)"

And that's comforting."
dcss,2sugy8,ManMan91,2,Mon Jan 19 18:49:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much.  There's also some strange interaction where base damage is way more important than enchantment modification.

dcss,2sugy8,Sharkman1231,3,Sun Jan 18 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"More precisely, increasing base damage by 1 increases damage 2.9 times as much as increasing the enchantment by 1 for this character with its current skills and stats.

Geh has the most hellfire and Dis is second most, so those are almost certainly going to be the two hardest.  Tar and Coc don't have too much hellfire, and for a melee character I'd generally find Eresh easier than Antaeus.  Also, some retroactive advice (too late for this guy, but for fire reference): Broad axes are an extremely mediocre weapon for late game, they're not nearly as good as the best one-handed sword or maces.  Generally you should almost never use shields with axes once you've found a good two-handed ax unless you find a ridiculous randart or Arga (or you're a formicid, of course).  If you want to use shields you're generally better off going maces or swords."

The reason I even started to train both was that I found a great randart axe very early, and I didn't know taking off a shield takes so insanely long. After realizing that, the cleaving was just way too powerful (and tbh, quick and comfortable) to abandon axes altogether, especially with the distortion brand. Being surrounded by monsters and banishing several of them in a single swing is just awesome.  I've also got an executioner's axe lying around, but going without a shield just makes me uncomfortable. I still can't really tell how valuable SH is in my position, I just noticed it's a huge difference as a mage (who I usually skill to use normal shields), so one-handed weapons were my go-to option when starting this char."

SH is kind of like EV, except it doesn't work on as many things, and it's best against single enemies (your chance to block considerably decreases after the first time you block in a turn).  It helps make up for your weak EV, but with over 80 AC and good resists it's not a huge deal.  On the topic of EV, it looks like you pumped strength on your levelups, which generally isn't what you want to do in this situation.  Strength is useful for wearing heavy armour (as a rough guideline, you want about as much strength as your armour's encumberance rating, but that's a guideline, not a strict cutoff), but if you already have enough strength for the armour you're wearing, then it falls off a lot and you're basically always better off with dex or int instead.  In this case, you're getting a very small benefit from your last 20 points of strength, since you can wear GDA just fine with only 25, and could have either much stronger spells or much better EV if those were in int or dex instead."

If you move methodically, the first 6 levels are usually not too bad. Try to avoid long/loud battles but if you have to, do it on a staircase. On the bottom floor, popping a scroll of magic mapping will save you a lot of time. Keep in mind the bottom floors of each branch are -cTele until you kill the unique demon at the end.

Alright, then I'll do a little more of Pan to get Conjurations and Spellcasting up to speed, hopefully that'll make things easier. Thanks!  One more thing: If I manage to banish the Hell lords in melee, do they appear on the Orb run like Pan lords will? Because that could be quite nasty.

(If I am wrong, please correct me people)  Don't worry too much about the orb run, it is far easier than what you are about to do, when you see something scary just teleport away the second you see it and chances are you will land somewhere far less scary. Also make liberal use of digging to make shortcuts towards stairs and if something scary shows up as you enter a level you can always go down and take another up stair"

If you banish them they can appear in the Abyss like anything else, but otherwise if you get their rune and get out you're safe.  Anyway, if you're going to grind for a ranged attack (which probably isn't necessary but could help I suppose), I'd probably go for iron shot.  Unresistable, you've got good aptitudes for it, and you've trained some death magic already.  I'm not sure what you want freezing cloud for.  It's good, but will take linger to grind and I don't think this character needs it.

dcss,2slb5o,Gabbo01,6,Fri Jan 16 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, having blink and conjure flame will do more than dodging our fighting would've to improve your survivability. I think you went about things fine.  Generally as a caster you want to get your core spells up, then either dodging or armour (typically the former at this stage), and then fighting after that. This is because fighting is mainly for the HP, and the amount it gives is based on your XL and racial HP aptitude. You wouldn't get much HP training it at where you are now.  You could get RMsl here or skip it for now, then do dodging to ~10 (just watch your EV basically), then fighting to ~10 (or 'til your HP is where you want it). Then get RMsl if you didn't before, and then think about higher level magic like haste. Given that RMsl isn't super important in Lair, grabbing some defence before it would probably work fine."
dcss,2slb5o,WinterShine,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, glad I was on the right track, even if it ended as YASD.  Finding spell books always confuses as a newbie, what spells are worth diverting for?   For instance, I've made another DeiE and found book of the sky at lvl 6. Do I get throw icicle castable, then pump everything into air to get airstrike, or forget about it for now? I've read that you generally focus on one of the elements at max."
dcss,2slb5o,ManMan91,3,Fri Jan 16 05:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've read that you generally focus on one of the elements at max.   Well to be perfectly honest, that's terrible advice. What might have been meant by that, however, is that you should only focus on one elemental school for your blasts (spells like bolt of cold, throw icicle etc.), which is more or less correct in the early game. However, even in the early game, training other elemental schools to get spells like repel missiles, conjure flame or mephetic cloud castable is definitely a good idea, but your character dump tells me that you already understand this. You'll eventually want either an irresistible earth magic spell or conjuration (like orb of destruction, iron shot or bolt of magma), or to train a weapon skill, but you can easily get your first two runes without this."
dcss,2slb5o,WinterShine,1 point,Fri Jan 16 08:39:26 2015 UTC,"Alright, I think i'm getting a clearer idea on how to level a caster. So many stupid deaths with a DE, but I can't help being a caster, even if I should relent and get my first win (or rune even) as a MiBe.  Are there general utility spells apart from conjure flame, meph cloud and Repel missiles, that you would normally grab asap?"
dcss,2slb5o,Quazifuji,3,Fri Jan 16 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"Swiftness - Lets you walk away from speed 10 enemies you're next to. Don't forget that it slows you for a while after the effect wears off, so use it to get to stairs.  Apportation - Not super important early, but lets you snatch runes and other things out of tough areas. Power affects what you can grab, but with high int and some Spellcasting, it's probably enough for most things without actually training Tloc.  Animate Skeleton - Free allies, and you can probably cast it without training. Also gives you the chunks without chopping. The allies are weak, but you can get them to stand between you and the enemy to get away from speed 10 foes you're next to.  Regeneration - Makes you less likely to be caught at low HP while resting, and is basically extra HP in a fight.  Shroud of Golubria - Basically extra HP in a fight.  Spectral Weapon - Only if you melee, but if you do, it's a huge boost to your damage output. Because it attacks when you do, it scales with weapon skill (because you attack more often at high skill, and hence so will it).  Summon Butterflies - Puts a wall of things between you and those centaurs. Even better in hallways. (This stays useful all game. Even extended.) And you probably don't need to train it at first, until later when you want it more powerful.  And of course, you're familiar with RMsl, Conj Flame, Meph Cloud, and Blink (which is yet another way to get away from speed 10 enemies, and sometimes good for positioning if you can use it in a good spot)."
dcss,2slb5o,Quazifuji,2,Fri Jan 16 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you mean by focus.  As has been said, throwing a few points into other elements for utility spells like repel missiles or conjure flame can be handy, but for damage you only really need one element for most of the game, plug some way to kill things that resist it in late game (often iron shot, but other things can work too).  The main thing is you want to make sure you're not wasting experience on redundant or even conflicting offensive skills.  Training both fire and cold for the damage spells, for example, is an inefficient use of experience, especially because one if the best mid-level cold spells, freezing cloud, can block fire projectiles.  On the other hand, there might be cases where a fire magic user could find it worthwhile to train some cold magic for simulacrum (maybe rare, since fire magic doesn't have the best synergy with necromancy summons, but it can happen)."

Heck, you even have a +7 great mace of holy wrath already, meaning you don't need to backtrack to an altar for TSO's bless weapon ability.

dcss,2shkzz,Delapos,5,Thu Jan 15 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think the key tends to be choosing your battles much more cautiously early on than a more melee-oriented character does.  There's a lot more running away as a mage, especially when you get low on mana.  One thing that I think is a mistake a lot of people having trouble with casters make is to kill everything with spells.  Killing popcorn like rats with spells uses up mana, which means if a more powerful enemy shows up (or is already there) before you get the chance to rest, you'll be fighting a stronger enemy at low mana.  Try to melee enemies you can safely melee instead.  You don't need to train any weapon skill, just pick up a decent melee weapon for things like rats or whatever that aren't a threat at all so you don't have to waste mana on them.  And when you do end up against an enemy that you don't have enough mana to kill, run away.  Pick your battles, and also be aware of which enemies are faster than you.  If you're against a melee enemy that isn't faster than you and you're running low on mana, run away before it gets into melee range instead of gambling.  Also, read Patashu's Rules.  It's long and poorly formatted, but some of the best tactical advice you can get.  It's not caster specific, but following it will likely help you succeed as a caster.  Much of the advice there involves tips on how to avoid fighting large groups of enemies at once, which is always important, but particularly essential on casters (while melee characters, especially heavily armoured ones, can sometimes get away with fighting large packs)."

It also means that you can take more advantage of whatever you encounter, say for example, you find a randart weapon as a Merfolk, it will be rarely worth it to take advantage of it since with the exception of SBl and Polearms your apts aren't too good. But as a human, if you find something good, you can take advantage and build your character around it.  You can also dip into many spell schools since low levels are pretty cheap.  However, they still benefit a lot from a god that makes things a bit easier early on to get them up and running, gods that give you allies are always a good choice in this aspect"

dcss,2s9sox,Quazifuji,2,Tue Jan 13 17:40:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was closer to -1 but that may have changed/been incorrect

dcss,2s9sox,Quazifuji,2,Tue Jan 13 19:41:11 2015 UTC,Well those examples are obvious because Spellcasting used to have an invisible penalty and Stealth/Invo used to have invisible bonuses - which was stupid so they just shifted all the apts one way or another. People on the Tavern used to say the average for everything was closer to -1 but I guess that wasn't true or isn't anymore - I missed this because I don't go to the Tavern everyday anymore.
dcss,2s9sox,tugs_cub,2,Tue Jan 13 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware of the penalties, I pointed those out mostly because I knew of them as the obvious examples.  I thought the average was closer to -1, but apprently it's closer to 0 bu in between the two."

They have no interesting mutations, fairly decent (if boring) aptitudes, etc. Their few selling points are the fact that they have decent apts in everything, and good HP for a +1 experience apt race.  Quicker stat gain is not very important. The extra HP is, though.  Most races have some kind of gimmick or mutation that you can leverage some advantage out of, even if they lose out on other things. After all, a character doesn't need to use every single weapon/magic school to win a game of crawl; you don't need more than one weapon, and probably not more than half the magic schools, which ends up ""wasting"" whatever potential you had in your other apts. You're probably not going to train up more than one weapon skill, so what happens to those wonderful apts in your other weapon skills? Ogres have a -3 to short blades, but thats not a detriment to them even slightly."

This is misleading - being good at multiple things is an advantage not because you are going to use every option the game presents in the long run but because you can run with any option the game presents from the beginning to the midgame. Combined with fast leveling, decent HP and unrestricted armor slots that flexibility makes them, well, probably just a couple places better than average, but that ain't bad. Consider that an evaluation of the effectiveness of a species should maybe not consider only its very best combos but its overall playability with different ones. And most importantly, that flexible playstyle is really the essence of the game to me. To paraphrase minmay, if you don't like Hu are you sure you like Crawl?

dcss,2s9azm,Darth_Ra,6,Tue Jan 13 06:55:57 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I think you might be thinking about this game in the wrong way. DCSS isn't a game about min-maxing, it's about being flexible and adapting to what the game gives you. I find that it's usually a bad idea to plan from turn 1 your weapon/god/spells. Some races are going to be shoehorned into doing things a certain way a lot of the time, e.g. felids,  but most races can do well with whatever the game gives them.  I've had games where a single early item find completly changed my playstyle. One game, I had a mummy summoner find a source of evokable invis (cloak I think), really early on. I immediately stopped playing him like a summoner, and started training short blades, stealth, and evocations.    Race decides a lot more about your character than background does. A centaur venom mage will probably have a much harder time with poison spells than a naga fighter. All that being said, here are some fun or interesting combos.   SpFE:Inner flame is fun, and fast movement allows you to avoid geting caught in the explosions.   DsAnything: Demonspawn are great, every game is going to be quite different, the miasma mutation goes nicely with corpse rot. The two ice mutations work awesomely with freezing cloud.   MfWz/MfFE: I really like this combo, it's really hard to survive the early game with their awful conj/fire magic apts, but guaranteed access to conjure flame makes poking at things over flame clouds fun.   FoAK: I don't like playing formicids, but lugonu gives the ability to blink to formicids, which is really strong. 2h+large shield is cool too.    CeWhatever + crossbows: I don't really like using crossbows much cuz they can't get below 1.0 turn firing speed, but having fast movement makes up for that a lot. Be conservative with bolts for a little while at least, you'll eventually be rolling in them. Centaurs still have a +1 apt, which is good.   HEWz: I feel that wizard is the best background for making a hybrid, and one of the worst for a dedicated mage. Grab a sword, debilitate foes with meph cloud, lure them into flame clouds, and hack them apart."
dcss,2s9azm,Sharkman1231,0,Tue Jan 13 07:43:50 2015 UTC,"Your centaur vs naga example is exactly what I'm on about...  The very idea of a centaur venom mage makes me chuckle, but it's not considered feasible because the stats say no.   I like your formicid combo, though, I'll have to give that a try."
dcss,2s9azm,Sharkman1231,3,Tue Jan 13 15:57:44 2015 UTC,A centaur venom mage still has a pretty easy start. Poison and fast movement allows for great kiting.
dcss,2s9azm,ManMan91,3,Tue Jan 13 18:21:22 2015 UTC,"Any combo is possible in Crawl. Just look at these two accounts, which are dedicated to playing random combos, and notice the near 70% win rates. In fact Centaurs are arguably better Venom Mages than Nagas early on anyway because their speed lets them kite their enemies while they die of poison. That being said, you're much better off playing more natural (if quirky) combos like the FoAK that /u/Sharkman1231 suggested until you get more used to the game."
dcss,2s9azm,tugs_cub,2,Tue Jan 13 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"Thirding what's been said here - pretty much any centaur is good because of their speed and HP and effectiveness with ranged weapons. Two important lessons - skill aptitudes are not the only thing, and backgrounds are just a suggestion. But keep in mind that if you're still learning the basics of tactical play (more on that in a second) you might want to stick to a more straightforward game plan."
dcss,2s9azm,Quazifuji,4,Tue Jan 13 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"Vine Stalkers in general are underplayed but extremely powerful.  They're very versatile, you can play them as just about anything, although I wouldn't recommend going the pure caster route because build in guardian spirit can be a pain then.  HOFE is a combo that works a lot better than you'd expect.  Their magic aptitudes are much better than they look at first, and their tankiness is nice relative to the standard mage.  Gargoyles also work well as tanky mages.  Formicids work well as tanky casters too, but their permastasis makes them really hard to play because their escape options are so limited (some players consider them the second weakest race in the game after Mummies).  Still, I find formicids a ton of fun, and they're amazingly strong aside from stasis.  A FoFi of Chei was one of my favorite wins, but it was pretty difficult.  Also, if you're trying to make unusual characters, you don't just have to think about races and classes.  Don't forget about gods.  I don't know what your friends use, but a lot of players act like the only gods in the game are Trog, Okawaru, Sif, Vehumet, Dith, TSO, and Zin (for melee characters, casters, stabbers, and extended, respectively), but other gods can be very effective.  Give Fedhas a shot, for example.  He's one of the least popular gods, but he's also one of the most powerful early game gods there is.  Build up an army of wandering mushrooms, set up Oklob farms for nasty situations like branch ends, and have fun.  He's extremely versatile, works well for nearly any strategy.  Kiku is also very strong.  You don't even need to start as a Necromancer, becuase he'll give you some low and mid level necromancy spells anyway (although being a Necromancer guarantees you get some nice ones, including guaranteeing animate skeleton and animate dead).  A lot of people take Kiku for the gifts, but I think his most powerful ability is actually Request Corpses.  Being able to summon an on-demand army of zombies or, eventually, simulacrums is amazing.  Torment and mummy curse protection is also extremely strong if you decide to go for more than 3 runes.  Any sort of necromancer, conjurer, venom mage, or ice elementalist works well with Kiku (undead minions are immune to poison and negative energy and very resistant to cold (simulacrums are immune), so you can fire bolts of venom or draining and poison clouds through them without hurting them).    If you want something even more unusual, try an enchanter of Kiku.  The pain brand goes amazingly well with short blades, and the combination of the pain brand and undead summons will give you a good backup plan against enemies you can't stab.  If you go with a vampire enchanter, you can also get blood on demand from request corpses."
dcss,2s9azm,Quazifuji,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"Formicids are tons of fun, but I've actually never tried the tank caster route with them.

dcss,2s9azm,TungstenYUNOMELT,3,Wed Jan 14 05:16:37 2015 UTC,"Formicids actually have pretty excellent magic aptitudes.  And Chei worshippers should almost always go the tank caster rout, since it's the best way to take advantage of their stats.  Formicids of Chei are tough, though, since Chei abilities are basically their only way to escape.  I've never gotten too far with Fedhas either, actually, but good players often consider him one of the strongest gods in the game, and he's incredibly versatile, so if you like trying out things that work but aren't commonly played then he definitely fits your goal.  Also, your friends criticizing you for playing weird combos is just silly anyway.  Part of the fun of Crawl is the ridiculous number of combos and strategies you can try, and it's completely deliberately designed so that some races or classes are harder than others - it's essentially the game's difficulty system.  Only playing popular combos might be the most reliable way to win, but it's certainly not the best way to have fun.  The best players often play weird combos to challenge themselves anyway.  If Crawl was only about min-maxing and not challenging yourself and experimenting with strategies, about half the races and several classes (at least Chaos Knights) wouldn't exist.  Chei would be gone too."
dcss,2s9azm,ManMan91,5,Wed Jan 14 05:57:54 2015 UTC,"Draconian Transmuters are fun.  Maybe not the most original, but certainly not easy and if you get it rolling and find the right spellbook you get to go RAAWRRR later in the game."
dcss,2s9azm,Quazifuji,2,Tue Jan 13 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"Original is more what I was looking for, I think. As much as the top suggestion is technically correct, my pride chafes at the thought of playing a normal wizard. Now an ogre wizard? You're speaking more my language.   That being said, a draconian transmuter does sound like it'd be a good time."
dcss,2s9azm,BacchusReborn,4,Tue Jan 13 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"Ogre wizard sounds good to you? How about a troll wizard? They're much more durable early on than their ogre cousins, and their claws will tear through just about anything in the early game. The spells in the wizard's the starting book are all low enough level that even with a troll's low intelligence and bad magical aptitudes, they can be casting all of them semi-reliably by lair, plus wizards have the highest starting intelligence of any background. I recommend ignoring magic dart and focusing on your claw magic (read: unarmed combat) until you get it to about level 10, and then start getting some of your second level spells online, then the level 3's. Gods like Ashenzari and Cheibriados are good for this combo because they make up for a troll's normally poor magical abilities by boosting skills and intelligence respectively. Don't train spellcasting very much, train the relevant spell schools; this is good advice for any spellcaster, but it's especially true for troll casters since their spellcasting aptitude is the tied for the worst aptitude in the game.  If you want to play a troll who casts spells as their primary shtick (rather than as a support shtick like I suggested above), you can start as a troll earth elementalist. Trolls have a -1 earth magic aptitude, making it tied as their second best aptitude, so with (say) Chei's intelligence boosts, they can be as good at earth magic as a human, and much cooler! You'll still want to train claw magic though, they're just so good at it that be a tragedy not to."

dcss,2s9azm,Ephine,2,Tue Jan 13 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with his. I think Wizards have the most interesting starting spellbook. Rather than 6 different blasts, you get a summon, an aoe, area control flame thingy, a buff, a debuff and an escape option so you get to try out different things.  I hear they're not the recommended spellbook to start with, but as a newbie I appreciate the different options."
dcss,2s9azm,ManMan91,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"Magic Dart is the best starting spell bar none because of its range.

dcss,2s9azm,ManMan91,3,Tue Jan 13 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"Min-maxing is a gaming term that refers to getting the best possible character for a certain purpose while sacrificing anything unnecessary.  Back in the days of D&D you could pick up various detriments to your character to gain perks, or you could ignore training some stats in favor of others. So you could have an all powerful warrior who was an orphan, albino, missing his left toe, illiterate, reclusive, and unable to smell or something."
dcss,2s9azm,tugs_cub,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"It's actually a term from RPG's, which is used a lot when talking about D&D character optimization, among other things. It means spending resources to maximize a character's ability to do X while spending fewer resources on a character's ability to do Y (i.e. minimizing Y). For instance, the resource could be gold, X could be a character's melee combat, and Y could be a character's defences; spending most of your gold on an expensive magic sword instead of better armour would be ""maxing"" the character's melee offence while ""mining"" the character's defences. Resources could also be things like stat points to allot etc.. This tends to focus on the long term because RPG characters are typically long-lived, which does not apply well to Dungeon Crawl since a character can die at any moment (especially in the early dungeon) and needs to use the best gear the dungeon has provided immediately, rather than holding out for god X and weapon Y and armour Z..."

You may be lagging behind your friends because they are playing simpler/easier stuff, and you might want to try that, but if you learn in the long run to be adaptable and play different things you're actually going to be a better player than they are. That might be a steep learning curve though. Tactics - what (not) to fight, how to fight, where to fight, when to run - are more important than getting your skills absolutely right but some combos have more of a margin for error in character-building than others so if you find yourself getting stuck you might try to simplify on that front temporarily.  Some thoughts on the combos you listed:   DDAr - deep dwarves are excellent for a few reasons, but the one I'm going to point out here is that starting with a wand of healing is crazynuts. You probably want either Makhleb or Elyvilon as your god for HP restoration - use the wand to get that far and don't be afraid to burn a few max MP on the recharge ability. Artificer is not necessarily a bad choice (use the wands, duh) but earth elementalist, necromancer, healer, maybe berserker are probably the most popular. If you don't like those you might even try a fighter or gladiator. FeFE - actually not bad at all. Felids are better than a lot of people think because they are faster than most monsters. Blast stuff with fire, run away, repeat ad nauseum - note I didn't say felids are fun, necessarily. When I did this it was felid conjurer, not fire elementalist. I forget why, might just have been because the new conjurer book was new. HaAE - traditionally halflings have been pretty good. They're a well-rounded race with a great aptitude for slings. However slings were nerfed at some point during the recent ranged combat reform, not sure if they were eventually de-nerfed a little? I'm not sure how that ended up. AE is... interesting. Shock is good, Repel Missiles is nice, Swiftness used to be totally broken but is now just a decent escape spell, the one that shocks stuff adjacent (and you) is ok, Lightning Bolt is okay but loud as hell and I don't like it as much as say Fireball. Maybe not the easiest choice for now. In the old days of ranged combat I definitely would have said Hunter (I've won HaHu) or Arcane Marksman. Maybe try something stealthy? OgHe - So Healer/Elyvilon is insanely good if used right. Stuff like HOHe or DDHe, you can put your invocations aptitude to use and basically pacify 85% of enemies in a three-rune game while healing yourself to survive while you bash the rest. DDHe is the low turncount speedrun character - if it sounds appealing to you note that it does require careful management of piety and hunger, but it's one of my favorite combos. Relying solely on pacification without the +3 invo is harder (I won't say impossible) and I can't tell you much about using Ely on a ""normal"" character - I suspect using her in a more supplemental way is not bad, though. You probably know what ogres are about - get a giant (spiked) club asap and hit people with it. If you don't want a boring old berserker other popular choices are hunter or arcane marksman because you can start with large rocks to throw, which are great. But  really you could go with a lot of different backgrounds and do okay. There's a guy, Ophanim, who won every background with Og, some more than once, who used to hang out here but I'm not sure if he still does. Your biggest downside you probably know is your inability to wear armor early on. Be careful not to fight more than one thing at a time. If you want to play something huge but a little more durable maybe try a troll."

DDAr also goes well with Trog because having evocations supplements the lack of magic.   DDHe is the low turncount speedrun character   Even better - it's actually 5 of the top 6 low turncount characters, with the other being a (drum roll) DDHu of Elyvilon.

dcss,2s6rsr,LipsAre,6,Mon Jan 12 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"My answer probably would have been ""no"", although it sounds like it worked out, for 2 reasons:   Black Mambas are one of the few enemies in the game that can outrun a spriggan, which means that it's not guaranteed you could escape without consumables if you couldn't stab then (for a non-spriggan, spiny frogs are also faster than you, and black mambas are faster than you are even if you haste yourself, so this would he even more true). These enemies are tucked neatly away into a corner.  They can be easily ignored, and you don't get anything besides a little bit of experience for killing them.   So, put these two things together, and trying for fight these guys is taking on a moderate risk for little potential gain, which adds up to it not being worth the risk to me.  This us all assuming you don't have invisibility.  Invisibility would make stabbing then all easy and make getting away pretty easy if something went wrong, but I don't know if it's worth using an invis potion if you don't have the spell castable."

I myself dont really bother with SustAb at all unless special circumstances.

This does have the potential to become useful at a moment's notice if you encounter something that drains stats or does cold damage, but you don't need to wear it for that.  Most enemies don't do cold damage or drain stats, so against most enemies this ring just makes you do less damage (and is a waste of a ring slot if you have something more generally useful), so you don't want to wear it all the time.

dcss,2s3ndq,ryeoldfashioned,4,Sun Jan 11 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"The axe of speed is great for now, though I recommend switching to TSO and blessing an executioner's axe after completing everything except for Crypt/Tomb, Pan, Hell, Abyss and maybe Zot and Slime. Even still, a +9 battleaxe of speed will get you through extended, especially with some more slaying. And like /u/zxc223 said, get your blink miscast lower before switching. Continue using the speed axe in places like Slime and Zot even after you get a holy axe. You'll want 26 axes when you get a holy exec axe, but don't prioritize this yet.  You need more dodging now. Your strength and intelligence are higher than necessary, so put the rest of your level bonuses into dexterity - you should have been doing this from the beginning, it's better than intelligence and strength for this character since you're not using CPA or GDA.   FDA is the best armour available for this character, though you'll need another source of rC if and when you switch to a holy executioner's axe. Switch to FDA if you can enchant it to say +5 or higher. Do Zot in FDA with the battle axe of speed.  Elf is a good choice for your next branch if you have a way to get more MR. In fact, your MR is way too low, and if you carry on like this you'll probably die to paralysis in Zot or Pan courtesy of an ancient lich or pan lord. You want at least one more MR+ source; one will make you immune to most things, including the banishment in Elf (with three more xl's that is), and more MR+'s will make you immune to everything. A cloak of MR is a decent temporary item for handling Elf if you have one. Expect to be banished if you go to Elf with your current MR, although with good positioning and offence you'll probably only get banished once or twice. Oh, and make a killhole (see the diagram up top) just outside of the main Elf vault, and draw the elves there by shouting, reading scrolls of noise and/or zapping wands of lightning."
dcss,2s3ndq,ManMan91,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  By coincidence, I just finished Elf:3 and for the first time I made a kill hole (I had read the suggestion recently here, before that I thought for some reason the walls in Elf were permanent).  It wasn't the prettiest thing, but with a wand of digging and then disintegration I made one that worked.  Then here was the perfect part - there was an Alarm trap not far into the main vault, so after killing the initial Elves, I triggered the trap (first time ever done on purpose), ran to my kill hole, and just killed them one by one.  So I now have Blink down to 4%, and am training Dodging.  In Depths:2 at the moment.  Also have a FDA now (and 6 scrolls of enchant armor), not wearing it yet.  So I think plan is:  build up Dodging in Depths; then switch to FDA (and enchant it); then switch to TSO and tackle Crypt & Tomb, then on from there.  And get my MR up!  One quick question:  what is the mechanics of switching gods?  Do I just choose ""renounce religion"" from the abilities menu, then walk up to TSO's altar and pray to him?

Then Oka will randomly throw titans and giants at you, but be aware: he usually does so as or just after you're fighting (I believe it's tied to check XP gain every ~20 turns, and throw enemies after you gain a certain amount, and since you gain XP from fighting, well, that's when he throws enemies at you).  Oka's wrath isn't terrible, IMO, just be aware it can come at really bad times."
dcss,2s3ndq,Quazifuji,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"One quick question: what is the mechanics of switching gods? Do I just choose ""renounce religion"" from the abilities menu, then walk up to TSO's altar and pray to him? While fighting off giants and titans periodically?   Basically, yeah.  As Balaroth said, it's tied to XP gain, so it'll often happen just after (or, when you're really unlucky, during) a fight.  They'll often appear surrounding you as well, which makes them particularly dangerous.  That's why blink is handy.  Generally, the best strategy is to blink away and run when they appear, then approach from a more tactically sound position to fight them off.   then switch to TSO and tackle Crypt & Tomb, then on from there. And get my MR up!   Don't use Tomb for this.  Crypt will give you plenty of TSO piety, but it usually won't burn off all of your Okawaru penance, and you really don't want any penance left in Tomb, it's dangerous enough without it.  The one time I've done the switch, I did it after getting four runes (Vaults, Lair runes, Slime), but before clearing Zot or Crypt.  I cleared Crypt immediately after switching, which got me to 4 or 5 stars of piety, then cleared Zot 1-4, by the end of which my penance was gone and my piety was at 6*.  While Zot's dangerous, it's probably the least dangerous place left to burn off penance after you've finished Crypt, so I'd probably recommend something similar.  After that, I did Abyss, then holy branded my weapon and got the rest of the runes (I usually do Pan, then Tomb, then Hell for the last 10 runes, but some do Tomb before Pan or after Hell - Pan is almost always easier than Hell, though)."
dcss,2s3ndq,ManMan91,2,Mon Jan 12 10:39:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Last night before I went to bed I got the Vault rune and cleared Zot:1-4.  Also switched to FDA, got it enchanted to +8, got Dodging skill over 20, put my last two stat gains into Dex, and got Haste to 8% fail (this is important because I found Heal Wounds wand and want to save my recharge scrolls for that one).  Edit:  also went to level 14 in a Zigg.  So the only remaining part of the game that won't build TSO piety is Slime, which I guess should be next goal.  After slime I'd then switch to TSO and tackle Crypt, Abyss, then on from there.  One tactical thing - should I abandon Oka now, then tackle slime (burning off part of the penance while period there)?  Or wait until slime is done, then simultaneously abandon Oka / switch to TSO and then head to Crypt?  If I just want to wait out Oka's wrath before switching to TSO, how many food rations are we talking about?  I'm worried about my gear.  For Crypt (then especially Tomb) I'd want rN++ (or higher), high MR, SustainAb, sInv, and rMut, and I'm not sure if I can get all that once.  I guess after Slime I'll regroup and give my gear a fresh look.  I have zero Cure Mutation potions so in much of the remaining game I'll have to have that rMut Amulet on."
dcss,2s3ndq,ManMan91,2,Mon Jan 12 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"I recommend switching to Zin and then doing Slime. Your gold is probably useless now, and 'p'raying on top of a Zin altar 1-3 times should get you to 5-6 stars of piety. Zin is good for Slime because Zin will protect you from mutation with more success than an amulet (100% at 200 piety, so wear an amulet of rCorr), and you'll actually get some piety from killing shining eyes. Zin is also better for clearing out Zot:5 than TSO IMO, so do that before switching to TSO (although if you're still under Okawaru penance, you may want to go somewhere else to wait it off). Converting to Zin also has the advantage of letting you cure any mutations that get through, and giving you some piety when you convert to TSO, not to mention the great invocations Zin offers - in fact Zin is IMO about as good for extended as TSO, although using Zin's abilities is a little more finicky than with TSO, who has a lot of passives and has more straight forward actives.  With regards to gear: TSO will give you rN+++ (necessary for Tomb, but not even rN+ is that important for Crypt), MR is mostly only important for the sphinxes at the beginning of Tomb (although be careful of vampire knights and ancient liches), sustain abilites is unnecessary with some restore abilities potions, see invisible is unneccessary but convenient in any game, and rMut is completely unneccessary for Crypt and Tomb (and see my comments on Zin for places like Slime)."
dcss,2s3ndq,BacchusReborn,3,Mon Jan 12 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Followed your advice, went with Zin, got Slime, Abyss & Tomb runes.  I think I'm going to stick with Zin for the whole game.  I absolutely hate the annoying Hell mystical effects, so that's reason enough there.  I found manual of invoc so got invoc up to 20, which results in a nice powerful Recite ability.  I also used Vitalization a lot in Tomb to reduce stat drain and rot.  Haven't used any of the other Zin abilities yet.  So on to Pan and then Hell.  This is my first game switching gods and first game playing Zin.  Oh and I switched back to my +7 Chainmail with rN+ (from my FDA) just to get rN+++ for Tomb, but I'll check my haul of artifact jewelry from Tomb to see if there's a way I can switch back to FDA and still get rN+++."

dcss,2s3ndq,klockklock,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:38:09 2015 UTC,"The difference between Okawaru and Sif Muna is that Sif Muna is still very strong in extended. Okawaru's abilities stop being as useful once you have most of your relevant combat skills near the maximum, you have a wand of haste/the spell and you have a good set of equipment; on the other hand, channelling actually becomes more important in the late game, especially in Hell where the miscast effects mean that you need to recover MP fast, or when you're fighting those endgame bosses who require a few more iron shots than your MP capacity will provide. The other thing is that Zin will prevent you from using necromancy, which is sad for a deep elf.

Generally you want a balance of AC and EV and not just a lot of one or the other. You will also probably replace the protection weapon with a staff, and you'll lose the 5 ac. Consider wearing ring mail instead of leather armour, or even better: swamp dragon armour or mottled dragon armour.  Once I had a tengu which had heaps of EV but only about 10 AC and MR++ (I was wearing all the MR I had access to). In vaults I got paralysed in my first turn of seeing enemies and went from 100% to dead while still paralysed (for 7 turns). This is one of the reasons why AC is better than EV.  I just noticed you're in orcish mines 3 but have barely explored the lair. That's not a good idea. Finish up lair with ring mail or something (you won't need MR except for some uniques and basilisks which you can probably handle) and come back to the mines only after that."
dcss,2s0dcv,zxc223,3,Sun Jan 11 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe evasion, until something moves to melee range, then switch to protection?   AC is just as good at range as EV is, if not better.  In case you aren't aware (I see this come up a lot in this subreddit), AC protects against most spells, not just physical damage like in most RPGs.  The things I'm aware of that ignore AC are torment, hellfire, the cold component of ice fiend and simulacrum melee attacks, and the freeze spell.  This is also why AC tends to be more important than resistances outside of specific enemies (like orbs of fire).  In general, I think Weeksy and zxz223 are right.  Generally, AC is slightly better than EV, but a mix of both is best.  In the case of a Tengu caster with a +8 EV ring, you're better off taking the AC.   I won (3 runes) with a FoFi but figuring out casters..   Fo are actually considered a challenge race, and some good players consider them the second weakest race (just above mummies), so getting a FoFi as your first win is actually pretty impressive.   Any other advice on this CIP is welcome!   Don't train all your skills at once.  I'm guessing you're using automatic training, from the looks of it.  Switch to manual, and generally focus the 1-3 skills you need most.  You probably don't need throwing at all, for example (you've already got spells for ranged attacks).  Right now, my highest priority skills-wise would probably be fighting and dodging.  Your rings are helping your defenses a lot, but your defensive skills are still very low, while your offense looks pretty strong.  Have you tried using battlesphere or IMB before?  Both are very strong spells that I'd normally recommend on Conjurers, although they might not be as useful at this point.  Both are very good sources of mid-game damage - Battlesphere adds damage to your other spells and can turn magic darts into extremely mana-efficient nukes for the period of the game where you don't have the mana to spam more expensive spells but have trouble killing things with darts, and IMD is a very solid non-resistable nuke, but with bolt spells online and airstrike for irresistable damage they might not shine as much now as they would when you can first learn them.  I'd still consider getting battlesphere (although utility spells might be better), but IMB is probably redundant with your other damage spells at this point.  Since you already have bolt of draining, I'd also keep an eye out for animate skeleton or animate dead.  You can shoot bolts of draining through undead without hurting them, so they make fantastic meat shields while you safely blast enemies from the back lines.  And zap that wand at an empty space two tiles away from you to identify it."

This is still beside the point, which is that tengu have poor AC, poor HP, and probably have more reason to turn off flight in situations involving airstrike than gargoyles do, despite the bonuses that tengu gain from flight.

If you are up against an enemy with airstrike, by all means turn off flight if they aren't popcorn by that point, but the 'default' should be permaflight on because the mobility benefits arise much more often and unexpectedly."

Now it feels more balanced, early game you can very often make it through with a weaker background without having to ge lucky and the game remains challenging and engaging throughout.  Also, things like contaminated chunks, non-deterministic poisonand those other you mention made the early game a lot harder, but once you got to the mid-game they became hassles more than anything, something not hard yet tedious to deal with.

On the other hand, the current monster tiles are vastly better than the old ones IMO.  I also made a few more comments about the differences between 0.9 and later versions here."

dcss,2rtbv7,karlthroway1,4,Fri Jan 9 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"Some advice unrelated to your equipment (which is lovely):  you should be pumping dex as a Mi, not Str.  Str is mainly good for overcoming the Encumbrance rating of heavy armour, but a Minotaur will generally start with enough strength to just slap on the heaviest armour you can find anyway, and if you don't need more strength to wear the armour you want then your defenses will benefit more from dexterity than even more str.  Basically, you should pretty much never pump str if your str is already higher than the ER of the armour you want to wear.  And that only includes armour you've found, don't pump str because you're hoping to find heavier armour down the line if you haven't found it yet.  When it doubt, pump into if you're casting a lot of spells, or Dex if you're not.  This is true for any heavy armour user with good base strength, but for Minotaurs Dex is particularly good because their retaliatory headbutt benefits more from Dex than it does from str."
dcss,2rtbv7,Quazifuji,2,Fri Jan 9 09:25:22 2015 UTC,I really didn't know on that one.  I usually just pump str for the extra HP and the str weighting on the axes. I'll try dex next time.

But for a melee character who doesn't have magic, they're pretty bad. Training staves and an elemental school and evo just to get your damage up is a pain. If you want to play with the enhancer staves, try a blaster mage book start. Acquiring staff while your highest magic school is the appropriate element (should be higher than conj) gives you a pretty decent chance of getting one.  Not sure how your training affects which kind of weapon acquirement would get you. It'd be nice if it dropped a quick blade, but be prepared for disappointment. I'd probably take the lajatang -- great weapon. Nearly as strong as a great mace, but requires a lot less training.  If you don't acquire weapon you should go either wand or armour. If you press \ then - you can see what you don't have id'd -- wand acquirement will try to give you something you don't have identified, and is weighted toward heal wounds and hasting. Armour you'd be pretty likely to get something in a slot you don't need to upgrade. So probably wand I guess.  Or you could go staff or misc acquirement. Staff acquirement will probably give you a rod, and misc acquirement will probably give you an elemental evoker. Since you've got 9 levels Evo already, either of those might be very handy for you.  Of course, they're known as scrolls of disappointment for a reason, so good luck with it no matter what you choose.  Edit: Oh, and I think it's a bit early for a meleedude to be thinking about spells, especially with that selection. Regen and Spectral Weapon are the two I'd really want, and they're both dual-school level 3 spells. Start thinking about them after your weapon situation is sorted, and you've got solid defences (you need 15 Shields skill to wield that shield without penalty - alternatively you could switch to a buckler).

Because then you can train Armour skill to get even more AC, and the amount of AC you get from your Armour skill depends on the base AC of your armour.  You'll eventually (much later on) want to get some EV again, but you can do that in heavy gear. Just put all your stat points into dex. (The rule of thumb is you need at least as much str as your armour's encumbrance rating, and everything else goes to dex or int. Since you're never going to cast spells, int is useless, and since you're a MiBe, you've already got enough str. So everything goes to dex.)"

It's incredibly cheap and provides a great deal of utility in blocking line of fire from non-piercing sources and giving you a run-away buffer from melee attackers. They die in one hit to anything, but their evasion is surprisingly high, and one hit still usually takes longer than the time it takes you to move one tile further.  2) Start thinking at this point about what level of spells you want to eventually be able to cast. At some point, you're going to need to swap out your ring of Wizardry for some crucial resistance or something of that nature, and still having a solid set of spells can be nice. As such, might put your next couple of stat points into Intelligence, as the early points make a pretty big difference in castability. Alternatively, just use Ashenzarai to retrain all of your spell skills into something else.  Hope those help, seems like you've got it pretty well in hand already!"

dcss,2rjpxc,SugarPimp,6,Tue Jan 6 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"Well it's not that you need armor skill to use heavier armor, it's that armor skill is better when you are using heavier armor. The main thing to focus on to improve spell success remains spell skills (plus STR >= encumbrance and then INT) even in heavy armor. Armor skill is mostly for improving AC. A ""caster"" can absolutely go heavier than leather and I would argue usually should. I don't generally go much heavier than FDA with a magic-first offense, with mottled being perhaps one of the best compromises, but note that most races can cast level 5-6 spells in plate or equivalent by the end of a three-rune game no problem."
dcss,2rjpxc,tugs_cub,3,Tue Jan 6 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"This is perhaps the one thing in the game for which I think it's legitimately worth knowing the formula:  AC bonus = (base AC of gear)*(Armour skill)/22   Base AC of gear means the AC that the gear gives before enchantments (so +0 plate and +7 plate both have 10 base AC). Do include your auxiliary armour slots (each gives 1 base AC except for the special races' bardings).  Basically use the formula to work out what ~10 Armour skill will give you in terms of AC, and compare that to what you think spending that XP in other skills would do for you.  Don't train Armour skill for anything else. If you want to cast spells more successfully in heavy armour, you're generally better off training the spell school than the armour skill to mitigate the disadvantage. If your armour is heavy enough that training Armour skill might be worth it, then it's heavy enough that you're getting a nice AC boost from training it too.  As tugs_cub mentions, STR (up until your armour's ER) is more important than Armour skill for overcoming penalties."
dcss,2rjpxc,WinterShine,2,Wed Jan 7 06:32:04 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth it. I've had a High Elf casting Tornado in Fire Dragon Armour who had 15 Armour skill. You can even go heavier with more skill investment.  I'd say once you have your offenses entirely online and you've got decent evasion, it's time for you to start upgrading your armour and training the skill so you can maintain reasonable failure rates. Mottled Dragon Armour is a very common choice for casters since the evasion penalty is so reasonable."
dcss,2rjpxc,Razawaza,2,Tue Jan 6 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely. On races with decent strength, like merfolk and humans, I'll often wear ring mail instead of leather armour or robes for most of the early game. Strength and spell school skills are actually the main factors here, not armour skill; in fact increasing strength to 1-2 points above the encumbrance rating of medium-heavy armours will typically be better for miscasts than increasing intelligence, although I typically choose intelligence anyway because it has other benefits."

Since the experience required for every additional level increases exponentially, this quickly becomes mostly irrelevant.

For example, going from level 20 to 27 unarmed combat would raise base damage by 7, drop the swing delay by a small amount and require as much experience as going from unarmed combat 0 to 20, so the efficient thing to do is likely to raise transmutation instead."

Since trolls have high dex + str they can dish out a ton of damage, which can be useful against late game enemies with big hp pools or high AC.   In crawl the best defense is a good offense anyway, and trolls have such high HP and regen that maximizing your damage output is always a good idea.

Your priority right now is training fighting and dodging - level 10-15 in each is reasonable. 2% fail rate with the power boost from your staff is good enough even in Zot for Orb of Destruction, but 10 EV and 17 AC is bad even now. You even have 16 dex, which is pretty good for this type of character in the early game. And anyway, if you're really keen on getting OoD to 1%, training shields to 5 will do it quicker. Some stealth will also go well with this character because of nightstalker (though on the other hand nightstalker will carry you through the game for now without any stealth), but your other defences are your priority for now.

dcss,2razve,CacoSReal,12,Sun Jan 4 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"It's not terribly good or useful. It has a couple points of advice on how to use your early spells, and then basically goes ""pick Vehumet so you can stop being a VM.""  Any guide which advises you to get Fire Storm or Glaciate is probably a bad guide.  Any guide which tells you to always take a specific god is probably a bad guide.  In fact, most guides that give absolute advice in general are likely bad.  Crawl is a game about tactics and strategy. Guides try to cover the strategy half. The problem is that strategy in Crawl is about adaptation and short-term survivability. Guides often get the latter wrong, and generally can't hope to achieve the former.  What you should do as a GrVM (or most other backgrounds) significantly depends on what you find in the dungeon. If I find, say, Fedhas (or Ash or Dith or lots of other choices) in early D, you can bet I'll take the altar, because having a god a few floors sooner makes me much more likely to survive through those early floors.  So why do caster guides always pick Vehumet? Because Veh offers spells, meaning that you aren't as reliant on adapting to the dungeon. This makes it possible to cobble together something resembling a longer-term plan in a guide. In other words, they give bad advice in order to make their other bad advice maybe not as bad (except in this case it's still kinda bad).  The best way to get better at crawl is to understand the tactics and the strategy.  This is what I mean by tactics:   Kite enemies back to cleared territory to fight them where it's safe. Walking away is the most powerful move in the game. Use consumables. Don't learn when to use them. Just learn to use them. Play slower. Even great players get killed playing too fast. Try to never go below 50% health. If you're around 50% health, you should already be trying to run away.   This is what I mean by strategy:   First train something to kill dudes with. When you're good enough at killing dudes, train some defences. (Even mages need defences.) Fighting is a secondary defence everyone needs. It's also a small offence boost for melee. When you're not good enough at killing dudes any more, switch back to training for that. Build your character to be better now or in a floor or two. Don't plan more than a couple floors ahead. You need to make sure you're going to survive that far first. This means picking a god early when possible. A strong god choice on D:3 is better than an optimal one on D:7 -- if such a thing as an optimal choice even exists. Trog, Oka, Vehumet and Sif are not the only gods. People sometimes play like they are, because they're the obvious ""melee gods"" and ""caster gods"" but the other gods, despite not being keyed to a certain build, are solid choices too (except Xom and Chei of course).   Basically, every time you have to make a choice, decide which option will help you survive right now. (This applies to tactics and strategy really.)  For a VM that's going to mean getting a set of spells from your starting book that lets you kill things, then some defences. What you do next is going to depend -- if you find some spellbooks with good offensive spells, you can use those to further your offence. If you find a good weapon, you can transition to melee. This is what I mean by adapting, and this is the kind of thing that a guide just can't account for."

Its a balancing act, but the early god thing isn't always a huge deal."
dcss,2razve,SvalbardCaretaker,5,Sun Jan 4 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"If one is new to the game, then going Fedhas and spamming their abilities is going to significantly improve ones chances over waiting for Vehumet. If you are a newbie every single floor is bought with a few deaths, vehumet is making you a stronger blaster but not giving you emergency buttons: Fedhas gives you oklobs/allies, very strong emergency abilities."
dcss,2razve,WinterShine,2,Sun Jan 4 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I think that a counterpoint to that has to be considered, which is that you risk someone training themselves into a very specific way of playing, and then they have to train themselves back out of it. At the very least, even if a player decides to wait on a god, I think it's good that they're aware of the strategic implications. (Just because we know how to play optimally doesn't mean we're obligated to if something else is more fun.)  I think that learning to play Crawl is more important than learning to play Vehumet in the long run anyway. Especially because of how passive Vehumet's abilities are. Once you know how to play a caster, learning to play Vehumet specifically is a pretty small step. Plus, learning to Vehumet means not learning to adapt, which is one of the key skills in Crawl.  (Trog has a similar issue, but is saved by simply being extremely powerful and having a zealot start.)  If I were to pick a god I'd want new players to learn well to become good at the game, I might pick Ashenzari. Ash doesn't give you powers to get out of bad situations, it gives you powers to keep from getting into them. If a player learns how to use Ashenzari well, then they are learning how to play Crawl well at the same time.  Also, I think just playing with multiple gods gives more experiences, and is honestly just more fun too because of the variety."

Looked at his character dump. The god choice synergizes pretty well with his build. dis invests only 5 points in Poison Magic, but thanks to Vehumet he can cast Olgreb's pretty reliably. I think his skill management in the early game is quite well optimized.   He has some very in-depth guides, for example: GrFe ^ Kiku, and plays with a wide range of combos. I am fairly certain he has some great high-level insights."
dcss,2razve,pereza0,2,Wed Jan 7 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"It is not clear to me if you can actually read/speak Japanase or just used some translator site.   I can, though only slowly, and I've been out of practice for a couple years, so it's more a combination of both.   I don't think the Glaciate/Firestorm advice is bad. He speaks about the lategame and points out some directions where you can go.   I would argue that it's almost never a good idea to go Firestorm or Glaciate in a 3-rune game. (Completely different for 15 runes or zigs of course.) Even in the dis game you mention, he didn't manage to cast it before XL25, and cleared Elf and Crypt in order to get the experience necessary to do so. Clearing extra areas like that which aren't necessary is an added danger and generally not recommended.  A few races can manage to get one or the other online with the help of Vehumet, it's true, but even in those cases you're getting it online right around the time you're about to win, which means you barely see use of it. Meanwhile, it's taking you a long time to get online, and your skill training isn't doing you a great deal of good in between (your level 6 spells were probably powerful enough anyway, especially since spellpower has a relatively heavy stepdown function, so all that fire/ice/conj training isn't really doing much else for you but getting the level 9 spell).  Instead one could skip Elf and Crypt, and spend the intervening time training something that is immediately useful. Auxiliary spells if one didn't already have them, defences as well. (Here the guide's author 'gets away' with low defence training because Gargoyle of course. That and having +5 boots. Still, I'd liked to have seen more Dodging in that build. This character could've been over 30 EV, that would've been very nice.)  Spending several floors training towards a level 9 spell you don't really need versus spending that time training something immediately useful is exactly what I mean by prioritizing short-term survivability over long term goals.   The god choice synergizes pretty well with his build. dis invests only 5 points in Poison Magic, but thanks to Vehumet he can cast Olgreb's pretty reliably. I think his skill management in the early game is quite well optimized.   Certainly Vehumet lets you spend less on your skills, and synergizes well with blaster mage backgrounds, no argument there. Vehumet is a fine choice for any blaster mage, no argument there. I'm just arguing that, if your goal is to win, you should not skip other good altars in order to find Vehumet. It's not so much better than other choices that risking waiting a few floors for Veh is worth it. (Note that the author found Temple on D:4, and didn't find any altars earlier than it. Perhaps, if asked, the author would even agree with this point!)  The early commentary in the guide on tactics isn't bad, I'll agree with that.  One other thing I'll note is that good tactics save you from bad strategy, but the reverse isn't true. This is, to an extent, an intentional design choice, I believe, because it lets you play suboptimal builds and still have a chance. In any case, it means that a player can make strategic mistakes (either unintentionally, or just because they want to try something different/more challenging despite the disadvantage) and still win if their tactical play is solid. When I go back and look at my first win, that becomes immensely clear to me! But this means that you shouldn't always take strategic advice from a won game.  If you really want to play with Glaciate (or Fire Storm), you can do it this way. I think it's good to point out that it's not good strategy (at the very least for other readers who come by this thread looking for advice on how to win), but sometimes enjoying the game or having fun means not playing optimally. I just feel that it's important to be able to distinguish viable from optimal. You can win this way (clearly), but it was not the optimal route."

dcss,2razve,ManMan91,1 point,Mon Jan 5 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot.  Actually, so far I have only tried the really lame and basic combos, like DD Fighter, but I didn't have a terrible amount of success with them, one time I did Lair and Orcish, but died right afterwards.  I could use some help in choosing a good combo. It would be great if you could recommend me a ""class"" for the Human race, since I always liked picking them in other games like Elder Scrolls. I haven't put a lot of research in it, but I guess Human is an all-around race here as well, correct me if I am wrong. In terms of classes I don't have any particular preference, I can play casters or fighters, whichever you recommend for newbs.  Thank you a lot in advance!"
dcss,2razve,Ricsiqt,2,Mon Jan 5 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Human Wizard. Humans have good aptitudes in everything, but no amazing aptitudes, which means that a background with a lot of easy to cast spells is good for them. I recommend playing a HuWz as a melee/spellcaster hybrid rather than playing it like a ""traditional"" RPG mage. /u/sharkman1231 posted a Let's Play of a HuWz earlier, and the videos do a much better job of showing you how to play the character than I could describe in words. The only thing I'll add is that polearms are great for wizards since you can separate yourself from your enemies with a conjured flame and then use the polearm's reach to still hit your enemy. However, if you find a great weapon early on like the +4 vampiric morningstar that sharkman1231 found, or even a weapon of venom or electrocution, use that instead.  Human Berserker is also more noob-friendly, although Gargoyles, Minotaurs, Orcs and Deep Dwarves fill this role better."

dcss,2razve,Gabbo01,2,Mon Jan 5 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"Heh. Humans without background. quite a challenge, and honestly a bit too broad/ not specific enough to give really good advice.   Humans: jack of all trades and master of none, they are good at adapting. You found a nice spellbook? use your neutral apts and get a few levels of conjuration to get mephitic cloud online.  Honestly, I cant really write anything to this.  Pick a berserker, and do the thing. Berserk a lot, dont change weapon types, train weapon to 8-10, then start training defense. Run away from orc priests, ogres, gnolls, generally all the pack monsters. Also most uniques- and if in doubt, run away BEFORE berserking. I'd advise axes or polearms, they are very forgiving regarding positioning. As for armour: use that which gives you the greatest sum of AC+EV, ring or scale male probably in the beginning, and with a bit of armour training switch to chain/plate.  Identifiying: as berserker you should make it to D:3 without trouble and have some stacks of scrolls- read all stacks of three or more. If you found ID, use on single potions. Didnt find ID? Read stacks of two."
dcss,2razve,SvalbardCaretaker,0,Wed Jan 7 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in. First note, i'm completely new and i've reached the Lair once or twice and died to the first things that I Saw.  My favourite D&D characters were monk and necromancer, so i'd love to recreate them in a newb friendly manner here."
dcss,2razve,Gabbo01,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"Lets go with Monk then. The easiest monk to play is troll monk- you get like a weapon upgrade thanks to troll claws. The troll monk should get you reliably to lair very soon, and allows you to make mistakes. Sloppy tactics that would kill you on other chars are survivable with trolls.   Upon entering Dungeon, turn on JUST unarmed (until you reach 7-9 UC).  Run away from the uniques sigmund, grinder, and pikel, they dish out more damage than you. More than one special orc like one priest+ one wizard? run away, they can give you trouble. On d 1-3 also run away from gnolls, they can have halberds and be very nasty.   Search for temple on D:4-7. I'd recommend ... makhleb. Second choices would be: yredelemnul, okawaru, nemelex, fedhas. Third choices are quazlal and dithmenos. What about trog? Like first tier strong, but if you wanted to play monk of trog you'd just start as berserker.    The trouble for trolls comes about here, monsters that kill you faster than you them:  ogres, orc warriors, killer bees, trolls, packs of yaks, in lair spiny frogs, hydras and blink frogs. What do we do with this? Since we cant just don armour we have to run away if possible, dont engage, and use consumables. Hex wands and attack wands:  spam them, drink you identified potions like mad... really for a troll this is the most dangerous part of the game, before you find your first armour.   After UC 7-9: spend a few points on dodging, 6-7 should give you minimal increase in EV, and then fighting to 5. Afterwards UC again.   How to get armour that fits? If you see a dragon or troll, and you manage to kill it without dying chop them up! They might give you a hide you can wear. And if you enchant that hide with Enchant armor scroll, you have armour and are done for quite a while.   If you get an early lair 8-9, do a bit more dungeon first, down to D:10 I'd say. In lair: run away from hydras, spiny frogs and blink frogs if possible. Since frogs are faster than you are, thats kinda a tough undertaking and will probably cost you consumables. If you have to engage them, only do it on perfect terms, alone, full health and buffed.   lair down to 4-5 should be alright, depending on wether you get death yaks, hydras etc. After that, go into orcish mines 1-2, clear them out carefully, do one level more of dungeon, go into lair again for a bit more... This can be really annoying, but the difficulty level is calculated very carefully, and this way you ensure a smooth transition. If a single floor is to hard for you, skip it at any time and maybe come back later! There is sharp spikes in difficulty, and a floor deeper may be easier than a bad one higher."
dcss,2r8z6q,Doom_Unicorn,8,Sat Jan 3 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"My low HP and poor resistances are probably going to get me killed once I run into some mean casters, and the high AC isn't as useful when I'm killing everything from far away.   On the contrary, a high AC will protect you just fine, even at range and with low resistances.  AC works on spells and such too, not just physical attacks as in many RPGs.  Offhand, the only things I know of that ignore AC are the freeze spell (rare and low-level), the cold component of ice fiend and simulacrum melee attacks (melee, and ice fiends are basically only in extended, so not a big threat), torent (extremely rare outside of extended), and hellfire (very rare outside of extended).  In other words, AC will protect you from nearly everything you face in a 3-5 rune game, and an FDA won't help against most of the things that AC won't protect you from.  You also may be underestimating Trog's wrath, which I believe will probably be much more dangerous than just proceeding with Trog.  In general, I would never recommending abandoning Trog unless you plan to get more than 5 runes, and even then I wouldn't abandon him until I had at least 3 or 4 (I would probaby usually get all three Lair runes and the Vaults rune first).   I doubt I'd make the switch until after Snake and maybe Shoals, but if I want to I should probably start training up Spellcasting now.   As a general rule, never train a skill that you're not going to be using immediately.  Planning for the long term has a tendency to get you killed in the short term.  Train the skills that you are using now, and train the skills that you will use later when you are ready to use them.  Also, if you're a melee character trying to get some spells online, your first order of business should be spell schools, not spellcasting.  If you're hoping to learn some charms, for example, grabbing charms skill is far more useful than grabbing spellcasting.  Spellcasting improves spell success rates a bit, but much less than spell schools do.  The main purpose of spellcasting is typically to reduce spell hunger and gain spell levels, but if you're a melee character adding some spells mid or late game you probably have plenty of spell levels without it and spell hunger is mostly a non-issue with low level spells.   No more conservative play for me!   In general, I think it's best to play conservatively at the tactical level, but not the strategic level (it seems like you're mostly talking about the strategic level here, so yeah, don't play conservatively).  In many ways, this is the opposite of what's commonly done in non-Roguelike RPGs, where strategy focuses on long-term optimization and tactics often involves farming as efficiently as possible.  Crawl tactics revolves around extreme caution, but Crawl strategy tends to revolve around adaptation, flexibility, and prioritizing short term survival over long-term strength.  In this case, it seems like you're getting the hand of the adaptation part, and it's working out for you, which is awesome, but you also have to not get carried away.    Major strategy switches often mean short-term power sacrifices for long term gain, which as I said, is generally a bad idea in Crawl, so you have to be careful.  Slapping on some Orange Crystal Plate and an awesome crossbow and giving up on your dream as a needlestabber early worked out, because that equipment is so ridiculously strong that it will give you a power boost even when you're still training the crossbow and armour skill to use it properly.  On the other hand, abandoning Trog and slapping on some FDA is a massive power dip, since you've presumably been training for your crossbows and heavy armour, and now suddenly you're under Trog wrath and your defenses are weaker.  Your defenses will never recover, and you'll need to get some spells online and survive Trog's wrath before you get into a position as good as you were in before (and it might never be as good, since your defenses in FDA will never be as good as in CPA), and you're extremely likely to die in the meantime.  You could train up your spell skills in advance so you can learn some spells the instant you abandon Trog, but you're still giving yourself a short-term handicap while you're worshipping Trog but training skills you can't use yet, and then when you finally get the ability to use them you have to deal with Trog wrath."
dcss,2r8z6q,Quazifuji,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, TIL about AC being awesome. This is a great advice post, so thank you for that.  My most successful characters have always been hybrids that leaned towards magic and added a melee skill once they found a sick weapon (High Elfs, Draconians, Demonspawn), so I'm not all that familiar with the mechanics around high armor fighter types.   My follow up question to you would be: how worried do I need to be about my ridiculously low EV? Should I be training Dodging/Armor any more? Or should I maybe be maxing Fighting next to get the highest possible effective HP?  My offensive capabilities feel as strong as I need them to be for a long time (my Arbalest was killing death yaks before they got into melee range), so my strategic plan is probably to make sure I don't get smited/tormented to death."
dcss,2r8z6q,Quazifuji,2,Sun Jan 4 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, TIL about AC being awesome. This is a great advice post, so thank you for that.   It's a pretty common mistake.  In many RPGs, armour and evasion are for physical attacks and resistances are for magic so you need to balance them, and I often see people assuming DCSS is the same and overrating resistances while underrating AC and EV because of it.  AC and EV are much more important than resistances, especially AC.  You can get away with terrible resistances but great AC in most scenarios (there are some exceptions, like Orbs of Fire or melee with Ice Fiends),/while having low AC but good resistances is very dangerous.   >My follow up question to you would be: how worried do I need to be about my ridiculously low EV?

If you're happy with your offense, I'd prioritize getting dodging and armour skill for defense.  Grabbing some dodging to make your EV a bit less pathetic is a good idea eventually, especially with such good Dex, but your armour skill is pretty low right now and in CPA your AC scales really well with it.  Torment shouldn't be on your radar yet, or possible ever if you're not going for more than 5 runes (and having kos health doesn't make it more threatening anyway), and smiters can usually be managed with careful control of vision and use of corners.  If you have any bolts of penetration, they're good for taking out smiters hiding behind other guys.  You can also always train more fighting to help with them."

Start EE and train earth until stone arrow is reliable, then pump unarmed and use stone arrow to soften tough targets Start hunter and pick javelins Transmuter Artificer - I think this is an underutilized background. The starting wands can totally negate a lot of early threats, and this allows you to dump a lot of exp into unarmed and gives you strong options when you find more wands/evocables.   I mean, keep in mind that you're an octopode, but unarmed Op can work. Some other important notes; you may want to train dodging and fighting somewhat earlier than you would with other backgrounds/races. And a shield+unarmed is a strong combination. If you can pick up a shield by lair it's often viable to dump lots of exp into shields for defenses and just rely on unarmed to kill things.  Ru, okawaru, chei (if you know how to play chei), makhleb and trog are good god choices (I don't recommend fedhas because I hate him). Nemelex and qaz are also possibilities.  I have an addiction to octopode transmuters of ru, I've had like 4 octopode dragons of Ru 15 rune wins in the past month or so. Whether they start transmuter or not, it's a smooth transition from unarmed combat into stoneskin into blade hands/hydra form and later the other forms, but you have to get through the unarmed early game first."

Right now they are pretty confused and prob give random gifts all the time.  Slaying/ring:  if you don heavier armour, wizardry is awesome. Otherwise,you are gargoyle so marginally more AC is less good for you than other classes.   Honestly hybrids are kinda hard to pull off- you have too many different skills to train, and can easily end up too weak on all fronts. With earth its okay, single spell school AOE helps tremendously, and in your case the equipment really helps. I'd say, do you have high level earth spells?

First, the way rF/rC works that first pip is by a long shot the most important one (protects you from 50% of damage) you already have two pips of fire as you currently stand which combined with a good health pool (which you will have) and the means to take down the orbs before you take too much damage (you will have them too).  You should use scrolls of acquirement as soon as you lay hands of them, armour is usually a good call. Weapons you already get from Trog. Your jewelry is kind of lackig maybe ask for that.  Right now I would clear Crypt, it should be very easy and it should have good loot.  Next, finish Elf 3 since you started it. Bring tons MR and maybe dig a killhole.  And finally, Zot 1-4 is not much harder than Depths (though watch out for lone orbs of fire), Zot 5 is where its at.  Orbs dont actually cast Hellfire just regular fire, Hellfire is irresistible and shows up on extended mostly."

dcss,2qvnvp,WinterShine,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:50:29 2014 UTC,"Press x to examine things nearby, or X to go into a full map mode. In either mode, pressing e will set an exclusion--a region that includes every square in line of sight of the square you chose, which your character will not autoexplore into. You'll also get a warning if you try to walk into it.  In the lowercase x view you can also press v to examine things. You should examine any enemy you're not familiar with. It'll help you get an idea of which fights you'll win for sure, and which you should walk away from.  Edit: When to use it is any time that there's a place with something dangerous, like a unique, a room full of bees, or anything else you don't want your character to wander into when auto moving. The game adds them automatically for certain dangerous things like some statues and oklob plants."

I'd add this: consider putting a few early levels in Stealth especially with lightly armoured characters even if you're not playing a stabber. This increases your chances of not waking up early difficult uniques like Sigmund.  Edit: Having some stealth is worthwhile throughout the game as having the option of picking your battles can be a life saver any time."

dcss,2qvnvp,tugs_cub,3,Wed Dec 31 05:21:58 2014 UTC,"it is hard to learn how to deal with your foes when you always flee from them. its better in the long run.   Fleeing is a very effective way to deal with your foes.  The lesson about using consumables is good lesson too but honestly not fighting tends to be the optimal way to approach dangerous things that are sleeping or at the edge of visibility. There are times and places where you might want to pop a might potion and kill something for XP, but unless you're speedrunning XP is not hard to come by and this only works if you know that the potion is going to let you win. Plus the lesson about using consumables applies to using consumables that assist you in fleeing.  For an experienced player the thought process for a monster coming onscreen is something like:   can I kill it? (in my current situation) can I kill it using renewable effects? (god abilites etc.) can I kill it if I use consumables? is it worth using my consumables to kill it if I could avoid it instead? can I safely lose it walking away/to the stairs? else flee using consumables. (or, uh, actually go back to ""kill it with consumables"" if you're already sure you can and you'd rather use the killing consumables than the fleeing consumables because i'm only pretending this is a linear flowchart but you get the point)   Of course you, OP don't know how to make those judgments yet, but you're not expected to know. Learning that is what we call ""learning to play Dungeon Crawl"" so hopefully you enjoy it...  edit: oh is what you're saying along the lines that OP should try to fight stuff as part of the process of learning what is safe to fight? Hmm. I dunno but I think one should aspire to play as well as possible from the beginning  (which definitely favors being selective about what you take on) so you pick up good habits - you're going to screw up and die and learn lessons anyway."

Something to even the odds."

dcss,2qvnvp,WinterShine,3,Wed Dec 31 07:56:11 2014 UTC,"Practice makes perfect. Most threats you can simply walk away from if you haven't already let them close on you. (A key skill in crawl is recognizing hard fights before they begin.) If you have already let them close, then sources of haste, swiftness, blinking, or teleport can all still let you walk away. Summoning an ally in a narrow hallway or other advantageous terrain also works. Things like that.  But the biggest one is recognizing trouble before you're in it. Learning that wins games. With that you have twice as many good consumables (some, like might and agility, are very strong, but only fully effective if you use them before or early in the fight), and won't find yourself in as many desperate situations from which you need to escape."
dcss,2qvnvp,Quazifuji,3,Wed Dec 31 08:14:57 2014 UTC,"Walking away is one if the biggest differences between new players and very good players, I think.    Look at any advice post where someone's trying to deal with Lair around here, and they're probably most scared of hydras and maybe death yaks.  In a Tavern post I was reading not to long ago, many players much better than me were arguing that the most dangerous enemies in Lair are Spiny Frogs, Black Mambas, and maybe blink frogs, and that death yaks aren't too dangerous at all.  Hydras and Death Yaks are both speed 10 melee monsters (aside from hydras in water), which means barring some extraordinary bad luck with energy randomization, they can generally only kill you if you let them get next to you.  If you see a hydra or a death yak pack and you're worried you can't fight it, you can just walk away.  If you see a black mamba or spiny frog and are worried you can't fight it, you might need to use some consumables."

dcss,2qujeb,Razawaza,2,Tue Dec 30 23:32:37 2014 UTC,"Trogites are fine to train only your weapon skill, fighting, dodging, and armour.  If you find good evocables (like rods and things like phial of floods/fan of gales/lamp of fire) then it's a good idea to train evocations so you have a solid ranged options.  Trog is a very good deity for three rune wins.  There is no reason to ever abandon him if that's what your doing because his wrath can be pretty scary.  If you intend to do 15 runes, converting to different deities is more reasonable since Trog's benefits become less relevant later in the game.  The Shining One and Zin are excellent deities for Hell and Pandemonium.  Typically players can get their first two Lair branch runes and maybe the rune from the Slime Pits and the Vaults, then convert to TSO, rack up piety in the Crypt (and bless your current weapon) then complete the rest of the game under the protection of TSO."

dcss,2qujeb,Razawaza,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:56:12 2014 UTC,"While playing a pure caster, always try to maximize range.  Don't let dudes hit you.  That's obvious, but new players will melee things with their spells sometimes.  Spells like conjure flame and blink are good for keeping enemies at bay.  Most enemies will not walk over a conjured flame cloud so you can place one in a hallway and either run away or kill them.  Make sure to train your specific spell school to make sure the spell power of your killdudes spells are high.  You need to make sure that you are able to kill things with your mana bar.  (Don't put any points in spellcasting early if you can help it.  You need to make your spells strong, not hungerless). If you can't kill things with your mana bar because your spells suck, you either need to make the spells more powerful or learn better spells.  As far as weapons and armour:  Get a weapon branded with protection if you can.  If you can't, weapons with venom and electricity are good at finishing off enemeis in the early game when your mana bar is empty.  Spears are good for poking at things over a conjured flame cloud.  As a caster you don't need to wear anything more than leather.  If you haven't found a buckler, you can use leather armour.  Once you have one go back to robes.  Using robes with a buckler is good.  (You only need one point in the shields school to eliminate the casting penalties for most races.)  If you find a staff of conjuration/energy/(insert your spell school here) that would help you with killing dudes as well."

dcss,2qujeb,Razawaza,1 point,Wed Dec 31 00:14:21 2014 UTC,"What types of casters are you talking about?  I can't think of any that would have too much difficulty with killing dudes.  Magic dart never misses, flame tongue has enough damage, sandblast is powerful (especially while wielding stones), and shock is mediocre, but you can bounce the bolt against walls to hit things twice with one cast.  Vehumet is by far the best deity for casters.  He offers you more and more powerful spells as you get more piety, he gives you mana back when you kill dudes, he makes spells easier to cast, and he extends their ranges."

Or you can quaff potions or stuff. First thing you should do is probably ""close the door"", if you think you'll have trouble, and then try to pick the monsters off one by one at a later stage.  Your race is also relevant. With a Lv.3 DECj, for instance, you should have no trouble at all killing 3-4 ""easy"" monsters. A Lv.3 MiCj would have quite a bit more trouble.  Know what you can kill and run from the rest.  As an aside, you have ludicrously good mutations given you've been quaffing potions of mutation and eating mutagenic meat.

You should try to never aggro that many dudes, both on caster and melee.  If you open a door and see a group of four dudes, it's unlikely that all of them noticed you.  If they really did, run away towards an area you have already explored and fight them in a hallway.  Kill two dudes, then run from them to regenerate mana without getting hit at all.  Then kill the rest of the dudes.  Ever heard of pillar dancing? It's sometimes necessary to regenerate HP and MP.  Also if you're not on D:1 you can run to an up staircase and go up it so that only one can follow you.  Then go back down to fight the rest or go back down another staircase."

I'd imagine I can just keep leveling it as it doesn't really have a cap?   When you have nothing else to train, train those. You can go right to 27 if you want. Don't totally ignore dodging though.  Because you're in plate, the first 10-12 or so levels of Dodging will do nothing, but after that you'll start to get EV from it at the normal rate. Because of that you don't want Dodging early (because 10 levels is a lot at the start), but you eventually get a point where it's cheaper (more 'profitable') to get 15-18 levels of Dodging than it is to get a few more levels in Armour.  If you really want to, MiBe can win with only Fighting, Dodging, Armour and a weapon skill. That's how my MiBe win turned out.   dungeon wise, nexts steps..I'm thinking snape pit or shoals, then a bit more of dungeon? I have a vault available but I'm not sure how difficult the madness will be in there.   You're actually done Dungeon. Since a few versions back it's only 15 floors now.  Here's the 'standard' branch order:   D until Lair Lair Orc (take care on Orc:4, back out if needed) Finish D Swamp/Spider/Snake/Shoals:1-4 Get a rune from one of those Vaults:1-4 Depths:1-5 Get 3 total runes (the two easy Lair ones plus probably Vaults) Zot Win   Which order to do the Lair branches mostly depends on your gear, but usually Shoals is the hardest. Your rPois will help in Snake, so I'd go there first. Third rune could be Slime or Abyss instead for some characters. I'd probably stick with the Vaults rune on this character though.  Do a ctrl-f and check for boots and cloak. You haven't found the four shops on Orc:4 either, so you might want to go back and look for them."
