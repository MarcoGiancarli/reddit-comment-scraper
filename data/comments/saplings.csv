The water makes them hard to hide quickly, it makes them harder to take places (becuase then you have to bring water too). And they're harder to empty because of the water. In the long run there's totally nothing wrong with getting a bub it'll work for what you need and you may find it to be a dream, but I would definitely get a bowl if I was in this situation."

If the stem and bowl are metal or glass then you can soak them in a salt and alcohol mixture in a zip top bag and shake until it's clean, and either use a pipe cleaner or a cotton swab to get the gunk out. Don't forget to rinse it off afterwards."

saplings,3e38yd,YourRapeyTeacher,-5,Wed Jul 22 00:17:42 2015 UTC,You need something with a high alcohol % such as rubbing alcohol of ISO cleaner and salt. Plug one end of the stem and add a mixture of the alcohol and salt. Then plug the other end and shake it. Run some boiling water through it so there will be no taste and leave it to dry.
saplings,3e38yd,YourRapeyTeacher,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Do not use alcohol on acrylic! It will cause cracking and damage. Honestly, hot water and steel wool if you can get into it are you best bets. No chemicals/alcohol or anything like that or you will damage it and it's hard to rinse 100% out of an acrylic piece which can be a health risk.  You'd be better off with glass in the long run.

That's a somewhat specific thing that you have to test for, whereas a normal urinalysis test probably just checks for common problems that may occur among anyone.  Also, just so you know, I tried to join the military a while ago, as did my girlfriend. I ended up actually having a medical issue that needed sorting out which got me disqualified, but the medical screening (or ""MEPS"") that you have to go to is one enormous bluff festival.   ""Don't tell us your scar is from barbed wire when it was really from stitches, because we can tell the difference.""   ""Don't lie or forget to tell us about anything, because we can date your medical history back over 15 years.""   ""You have to tell us if you've ever smoked or had lung problems.""   Those are just some of the things they try to trick you with. Don't tell them anything unless it's absolutely necessary or blatantly obvious. Things like scars, birthmarks, noticeable physical defects, things like that, they are going to notice, but as far as they need to know, you've never been sick, you've never gone to the doctor or hospital for any reason, and you've never drank or done tobacco or anything ever in your life. My recruiter straight up told me, on the way to MEPS, that they will try to trick you and bluff you into telling them things, but you don't have to. Trust me on this.   The military isn't like how it used to be anymore. It used to be that anyone could get in as long as they can run, jump, and breathe. Nowadays, if you've ever had asthma, and I mean ever, you are rejected before you even sign up. The current system makes it impossible for the average person to be accepted now, and a majority of the population is average."

saplings,3e2osn,ZeevaZach,4,Tue Jul 21 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"My dealers have never known what ""strains"" they had, and, personally, I like that a lot. They don't know, and they don't care, because it gets them high, and I'm inclined to agree with that as well.   When it comes to trusting your dealer, I would highly recommend getting to know them on a somewhat personal level (if possible) or to have a middleman who does know them personally. My first guy was a middleman who always got great stuff because he was close friends with his dealer. Once my guy left the game, I started buying from his dealer directly, and, again, the stuff was very good. Once I moved into my new place, it wasn't really possible to go back to that dealer anymore, so my friend told me about the dude who he buys from. They both went to school together, so they already had that level of respect for each other, and I know for a fact that the dude is really cool. The stuff I bought from him is great, and the multiple times my friend has bought from him have worked out really well too.  So, to reiterate, it helps to have an actual connection with your dealer, or to be connected to someone else who has a connection with them. I would never consider buying from some Joe Schmo who is a friend of a friend of someone I heard about at a McDonald's or anything."

From my experience, it's just not worth the trouble to constantly be trying to hide everything from everyone; it's such a hassle and a worry. On top of that, your current age is when you are doing a lot of development, especially your brain. Smoking marijuana at your current age has the potentiality of impairing your mental capabilities in the future, which would suck. I mean, you only have one brain, so why chance it, even if the chances are low? Ideally, people should only start getting high at the age of 24, which is when the human brain completely finishes developing.  Anywho, it really sounds as if ordering online isn't a good option, so you may want to try looking around your area and seeing if there are any head-shops at a gas station or a mall. There's one in the mall near where I live and the dude sells bongs, pipes, screens, grinders, you name it.  If ordering online really is your only option though, try ordering this model from Ebay instead. I ordered this same one in purple when I first started smoking, and I haven't looked back. On the package it'll be labeled as a ""4-piece herb grinder with pollen catcher"", or something along those lines, which no one will be suspicious of if they simply glance at it. It's a 4-piece and it comes with a little kief-spatula. If you grind while holding it upside-down you get a really fine grind. I ordered another one in green for my friend for his birthday, and he loves it just as much as I love mine. Unfortunately it appears that they only come in the ""silver"" color now, but I still think it looks really cool, to be honest. Each one is made of high-quality, anodized aluminum. I would highly recommend this grinder to anyone, especially since it's only $10 and free shipping."

The only way to really even be sure is to get the seeds from a breeder or medical supply. Now, I couldn't really help you with trying to find out about OG breeze; but what I used to do to determine the difference between indica and sativa was to smell them. Indicas had more of a skunky smell that lingered, and sativas smelled more pine-y. Even that's no way to be sure though"

(I get that feeling if I fall asleep after smoking just once when I wake up) Paranoia can also occur, and I would assume it is from smoking so much.

He's a smart dude, mind you, and he's hard-working and friendly and all that jazz, but he'll forget to do something as he's going to do it, and will have trouble picking out his words sometimes.   That's just what happens when you smoke frequently. I only smoke once per week, and I'll still be pretty fuzzy for a couple days afterwards. My memory will be weird, I'll zone out way too easily, and I'll be kinda groggy.  I recommend completely laying off the weed for at least 2 or 3 weeks so you can more or less ""reset"" your brain and body. Two to 3 weeks is a pretty good amount of time for just about anyone to get rid of their tolerance and process all of the THC and other metabolites completely out of their system. If you still have these types of issues after your break, then marijuana just might not be for you. As much as it sucks, there are people out there who simply don't react very well at all to weed."

It will be these that cause some of your effects, but also there is a well defined withdrawal syndrome that can be experienced, as you described when decreasing your intake.  Its not a dangerous withdrawal, but you can get pretty  emotional (anxious or depressed)  and irritable for a few weeks.  I agree with the others, give your brain a rest, and if you are young don’t be a daily smoker until your brain plasticity has settled."

Point is, it's not as if I only use a vaporizer and then suddenly switched to taking super heavy hits from a joint, or vice-versa. I've been smoking for a while now.  It's really weird. Like I said, this has only happened one other time, and I have no idea why.

saplings,3dxwx3,scarlet_feather,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:43 2015 UTC,Is this a new strain or different than what you have been smoking? Maybe there is an irritant in a new bag you got. It's rare in the US (where are you btw) but not completely unheard of for shady suppliers to use dyes and things.  Also gonna go ahead and agree that hydration isn't instantaneous and just chugging a bunch of fluids isn't going to magically cure dehydration.  Here(https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/an-explanation-of-water-and-your-body-e8edf9071b0f) is a link about hydration.

saplings,3dxwx3,Rugby_HB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"If it is dehydration because you're not retaining water even when you drink water, try making a cup of salt water. 1/4 tbsp will do and drink water in small amounts at a time.

saplings,3dxwx3,Skizzius,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's not true though. Water doesn't work like that. I just looked up several things about water and none of them said that speed of ingestion played a factor in how much is actually absorbed. Plus, that just doesn't make logical sense anyway. Water still has to go through your entire system despite how quickly you drink it or not; it still requires time to first sit in your stomach and then go through to your intestines. The only things that affect how quickly and effectively you absorb water is how much fiber you eat and how full your stomach is when you first start to drink. Drinking it fast or slow does not matter at all."

I like the way you think outside the box...but no.  Everyone else is correct, it is quite common to feel high for another day or so when you get high for the first time.

saplings,3dutif,leon__furious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you if you're going to make a bong, I suggest using a nut or something similar (the metal one that goes with bolts) and a metal tube or pen for the down stem. If the hole in the nut is too big, you can find a metal washer that fits or use a screen. If you don't have screens, take that strainer bit from a faucet or use tin foil and poke a few small holes in it with a toothpick.   I assume you know how to make a bong, it's very easy, a plastic bottle, burn or cut a hole bit enough in it to fit the down stem, secure with duct tape or putty. Pretty simple.   I'm not so great at making pipes but if you want to try you can get a drill and make one out of an apple or something. Or find some metal parts that fit well together to form a pipe.  When I couldn't buy a piece I took a Zebra pen like this and turned it into a one hitter. It worked really well but eventually left a nasty taste in my mouth as it was still part plastic."

If you have the carburetor covered, air will be forced to go through the bowl, which changes where the oxygen will be coming in from, which ignites the embers to be hotter, which produces more smoke. Uncovering the carburetor allows much more air to flow through the pipe at a time, allowing you to clear the pipe and let the embers go out."

A lot of people say it's required, but I've always gotten perfect results out of just isopropyl alcohol.  Also, your guy at the headshop isn't correct. Isopropyl alcohol is non-corrosive and evaporates quickly without leaving residue, which is why it is such a popular cleaning agent in the first place.

Penalties for those caught with drugs within those 1,000ft can be charged with Possession w/ intent (large amounts, also having scale/baggies/stuff that dealers carry, etc), delivery, sale or manufacture They can be charged with 3-5 years at the discretion of the judge Those under the age of 18 could face lighter penalties Only applies to when school is in session or children would be expected to be around   So you're lucky, it isn't NEARLY as bad as some other states. On page seven of that document I linked, it has a table of all the main info by state, check out ones like Arkansas (10 year additional sentence on top of whatever else they get you with, no parole, and can be for just possession, even of a little, not a lot which leads to the ""intent"" part for sale), and Mississippi (where it's a lot more than schools - gyms, public parks, churches etc, and 3 years to life for possession with intent, sale or manufacture)!

Next thing I know my mother is yelling in my face and asks to see the piece I had smoked out of. So I hand her my bowl and she takes it but thinks it's fake because it wasn't warm.

As it stands now I only recommend the budy pen pro as a high maintenance jack of all trades that is worth the cheaper price, but not a penny more. There are other pens like the atmos that do the same thing but from what I've seen so far the budy pen is a bit easier to mod into a truly excellent vape pen. The main problem with these pens are they are made to vaporize dry herbs, oils and waxes but typically they only truly can handle the wax and oil with any consistency. If you're on a strict budget and have patience then you'll be able to get them to work for you and if you feel like putting in a little extra work they can make them even better. However if you're looking to invest in a vaporizer that should last and work I'd suggest looking into a Launch box or an Atmos, I've been very pleased with their products and hope that you find the right vaporizer for you."

saplings,3dr218,tuesday8,5,Sun Jul 19 01:18:21 2015 UTC,"Volume and the placebo effect. I have smoked a lot of bongs ranging from super tiny you can hold in your hand to almost 4 feet tall zongs and even an 8 foot long vaporizer bag.    Volume of smoke will have an impact on your high, if you have a tiny bowl and a small rig and only get small hits your high won't be as fast or as powerful (though depends on many factors).   Zongs (really long bongs) are fun because you can ""milk the bowl"" by building up smoke in the base and the stem until it almost reaches your mouth.  Capping said piece then taking the hit all at once can be really really intense and it used to get me blown out of the universe.  I have found over the years though that switching things up really helps with a high as well.  A high I get from a joint is different than a blunt which is different from the many of different bongs I have smoked.  If I smoke from the same piece I get used to the effects quicker because I know how to control the smoke.  If I switch things up I forget or my brain forgets and that can be fun.    There is the 8 foot long Volcano Vaporizer bag that I have done before and hands down that high is great.  A high from a vaporizer is different than other devices because the high is different (It is like smoking wax/oil, really clear but still head high).    So is there a scale? Not really, it is more just about overall volume of smoke, potency of the bud and how that effects you."
saplings,3dr218,engrey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Volume of smoke doesn't necessarily matter, at least for me it doesn't. I have a bong less than the size of a coffee mug, with a bowl just big enough to fit the tip of your pinkie-finger into, and I get rocked from that thing. Two or three hits from the bong often hits me harder than the same amount from my pipe, which has a significantly bigger bowl. Although this may all have to do with my last batch, which I accidentally mixed with some of my kief, so perhaps I need to do some more testing.  I like the concept of switching things up though. I smoke almost exclusively from pipes, but just the other night I rolled my first hand-rolled joint and more or less chugged through the whole thing in 5 minutes because I completely forgot about pacing yourself when smoking joints. Blew my mind, to say the least, lol"
saplings,3dr218,Afrew,4,Sat Jul 18 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Assuming that the bud you are using is the same you would use in any of these apparatuses, here's a basic rundown:  Vaporizers are by far the most efficient and cost-effective way to get high. They deliver the most of the original THC per hit, and you can also reuse the vaped material for edibles or, more rarely, for smoking. It's rather uncommon, but some people, myself included, get a good effect from smoking their duff. Since vaporizers can be set to specific temperatures, you can vaporize only specific cannabinoids at a time. When set to lower temperatures, starting from 315F at the lowest, there tends to be a much more clear-headed high, meaning you are much more physically functional than normal, but still have the great mental effects. When in the mid-range of temperatures at about 338F to 356F you get a good mix of both. This is really my preferred temperature range with my vaporizer, and I can maintain this high for a long time before the cannabinoids within this range are spent. At the higher temperature ranges, from about 383F and above, you get a much heavier body high, and much less of a mental high.  Joints are next on the scale of efficiency, believe it or not. Since the heat from the cherry travels down the entire length of the weed inside the joint before getting into your lungs, it actually vaporizes some of the cannabinoids within. Not nearly as much as a true vaporizer mind you, but enough to definitely make a difference. There's also the fact that joints can feel quite harsher than other methods, but I figure the trade-off is worth it. I've gotten the strongest highs of my life off of joints (excluding edibles, which are a different feeling experience anyway). For me, joints tend to produce a very strong body and mental high, so much so that I can't do much but slowly hobble around or sit on the couch, but, obviously, each individual will be different.  Pipes are next up. There's not really much to say about them at all; we've all smoked from one at some point I'm sure, and we all know what they are like. It's much easier to adjust how high you want to get with a pipe because pipes don't stay lit for very long, meaning you can just set it down for later without wasting any excess bud, and because the carburetor on the side affects how much smoke will accumulate within the pipe before you clear it. So, in effect, pipes are good for when you want to experiment with how much weed you want to consume to get to a specific level of high.  Bongs are actually the least efficient smoking apparatuses, yet probably the most pleasant to smoke from. It is a common misconception that bongs get you higher: the only reason people think bongs deliver more THC is because you don't feel the hit as much and also because the smoke tends to condense after passing through the water, meaning you can inhale much more smoke than normal, which, obviously, would get you higher. Also, some THC is actually lost in the water simply because of the filtration process. It's not a big enough amount to really matter, but hey, I'm just giving you the facts. Bongs feel very smooth, significantly better than joints or pipes. For me, bongs are even smoother than a hit from a vaporizer, since it is cooled smoke as opposed to warm or hot, dry vapor."
saplings,3dr218,Afrew,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Different ways of intake have different levels of efficiency (most highs for the least $). Here is my personal observation of least to most efficient: Soda can, joint, blunt, bowl, g-bong, bong, hash pipe,  bud vaporizer, vaporized hash, edibles, concentrates on a coil, nail, tincture,  concentrates in a ceramic pen, nectar collector."

saplings,3dr218,EminGH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:40 2015 UTC,My guess is there is smoke wasted between hits and people generally don't hold them in as long so you're absorbing less. I have just experienced that the same amount of weed in bowls and bongs gets me higher than in joints and blunts.

saplings,3dr218,Some18mysandwich,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"The high you get will all be the same (except, perhaps, for vaporizers), but the main thing here is the amount you take in per unit of time.

saplings,3dnzm7,whythisgame,59,Fri Jul 17 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"The sad truth is that not enough unbiased research has been done to show how marijuana affects our health, since it has been so incredibly poorly funded for decades. Here's what I can tell you:  Smoking  The temperature of the smoke isn't that great for your lungs, since it's so hot, and inhaling any kind of organic material into your lungs isn't that great for you. However, there have been a lot of conflicting studies down on just how much this plays into effect -- some studies have shown that marijuana smoke is 3x more harmful than tobacco smoke, whereas others have shown that marijuana smoke isn't harmful at all. My personal opinion is that smoking anything is going to be somewhat bad for you, but I really don't think it compares to smoking cigarettes since most people who smoke cigarettes smoke a lot more times in a day than you ever will (unless you're Snoop Dogg). Here's a pretty good study to back up what I'm saying here.   Memory  Again, this is another area that is mostly a big question mark since not much research has been done. Weed seems to negatively impact children's memory, but there's not evidence that it impacts adult's memory for an extended period of time. I do believe that it can make you more forgetful and cause slight memory impairment for up to 24 hours after consumption, but it isn't anything major. The stories you often hear about people developing some kind of mental disorder from weed are usually bullshit, though weed can sometimes trigger a pre-existing condition (like schizophrenia, for example). So basically, if you're an adult, you're not going to be permanently negatively impacted by smoking marijuana. It can make you temporarily more forgetful, but that's it.   Mental Health  Cannabis can decrease anxiety and feelings of depression. Some studies have shown that weed can increase anxiety, but I'm a bit skeptical about that because I've never, ever heard of a person becoming more anxious from smoking weed, unless they are very high and paranoid, and have both experienced a significant decrease in anxiety from smoking myself as well as seeing the same effect happen with many others.   Cancer  Cannabis is not a mutagen which means that it cannot and will not alter the structure of your DNA (this is a good thing!). Some studies have shown that weed can cause cancer, but I really do think that's bullshit because it's a) not a mutagen and b) has been used successfully to treat cancer in many different cases. In regards to lung cancer, the Internation Lung Cancer Consortium did a study and found that ""Our pooled results showed no significant association between the intensity, duration, or cumulative consumption of cannabis smoke and the risk of lung cancer overall or in never smokers."" They also cautioned that ""Our results cannot preclude the possibility that cannabis may exhibit an association with lung cancer risk at extremely high dosage.""  Toxicity  No one in the history of the world has ever died from a marijuana overdose, and you won't either. According to a 1988 US administrative law hearing, you would have to smoke 11,500 pounds of weed in 15 minutes to die from it. With that being said, you probably/definitely shouldn't smoke weed if you're pregnant. Remember earlier in this post when I said that smoking weed as a child can fuck up your brain? Yeah, well this is a fetus we're talking about here, so please don't smoke anything if you're pregnant.   TL:DR - if you're a fully grown adult and your name isn't Snoop Dogg, your health will probably not be significantly impacted by marijuana consumption."

Most of the evidence that it slows/stops tumor growth is on an individual basis though, and there haven't really been any comprehensive studies or reviews to verify the claim. That's why I said it was used successfully in many cases, but there's no ""solid proof"" to show that it works for every person or that it's the sole cause for stopping cancer."

I can't give you a direct answer since I don't know this to be true or not, but marijuana may have negative effects on a persons mental health for those predisposed to theses illnesses. Furthermore, one may suffer for increased anxiety and decreased cognitive functionally when smoked in large amounts (frequent vs occasional smoker).  Hope this helped!"

As for mental health it can trigger problems but only if they are already underlying issues that havent surfaced yet. Same as how psychedelics are with mental illness with the exception that with psychedelics even if you are completely healthy you can develop issues from a psychotic episode
saplings,3dnzm7,TheMonsterCock,2,Sat Jul 18 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"There are a few mental health issues that can arise from getting too used to it. It's very easy to become dependant on it because It will reduce depression and anxiety when using but can increase both for a short amount of time when not using. This makes you more likely to smoke to remove these symptoms and this is the road to dependency.  I know it's not addictive in the direct sense but there is a roundabout way of making the new normal your high and normal being low which is a form of dependancy. I kind of wished this wasn't as brushed away as it is.  Like alcohol (which is worse) we are told of the dangers and act accordingly. Weed sadly just doesn't have all the facts in light and because of this people get a bit to biased in praising it, since it's been the opposite for many years. It's important to be aware of these effects but at the end of the day It's probably not that bad in moderation. Just don't smoke to escape life, smoke to enhance your life. If you find that life is becoming dull and you want to escape it you can become dependant this way."

I found a Doctor in LA, told him that weed helps with headaches, falling asleep, and social anxiety. He didn't ask much else. Paid $40 and I wanna say $30 for renewals.   The whole process is pretty easy! I south of LA in OC, and there are plenty of dispensaries here (many that will even deliver to you, although I have no experience with deliveries)  Let me know if you have any other questions!  Edit: as for cops? Dunno. Depends. If they think you're smoking in your car they'll definitely stop you. Just try and be smart about where you choose to smoke."
saplings,3doxhn,dm1681,3,Sat Jul 18 04:38:17 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I live in the bay area, and everything dm1681 has said is pretty much on par with what I've experienced as well. Most dispensaries are simple, you walk in, give them your ID and the paper (recommendation) the doctor gave me, and my ID, and fill out a form. Once that's done, they let me into the room where the product is held. I go in, and they have a lot of choices from flowers (bud), concentrates (wax), topicals (lotions), edibles (yum-yums), and clones (seeds). My experience is mostly with just bud, and usually they'll let you look at it and smell it before you decide if you want to buy. If you're looking for something but don't know what, you can describe what you want to feel like, and the budtender will usually recommend something. Most dispensaries only require an ID on visits after the first, since you're already in their system. Some might be more picky, but in my experience, the ones that want me to bring the recommendation every visit are usually higher quality. And on your first visit, they almost always give you a free gift (usually free grams, edibles, or pre-rolls.)  I do have experience with delivery, since I'm currently without a car. I use Eaze which is available in the bay area, but just recently expanded to SoCal, and it's pretty legit. Sign up with a picture of your ID and recommendation, and once you're approved, just log in, select what you want, and they come to your place, 20 minutes or less. They only accept cash, and the drivers don't take tips.  P.S. If anyone wants to try Eaze, ask me for my discount code. If you use my code, you'll get $35 off your first purchase, and I'll get $10 off my next one, which I could use because I am broke lol."

It's really fucking easy.   I'm in the Bay Area and there is no shortage of dispensaries and delivery services. It's not sketchy at all - I smoke on my porch and wave at the securitas private security with my bong in hand. It's very chill."
saplings,3doxhn,Woopwoopdrugs,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Med Card and Dispensaries - Not really quite as ""easy"" as Amsterdam, where its pretty much just like buying a beer. Try and find a doctor that you pay AFTER you get your rec, as the doctor will be much more inclined to give you a med card. Also, most dispensaries have a waiting area where you have your Rec + ID checked out, and then you go into the actual buying area, basically just a regular store. You can't really smoke on the grounds in or near the dispensary. There are however some ""weed bars/clubs"" where you can buy and smoke at the same location.   Police and Weed  - Based on my own experiences it seemed like most cops probably wouldn't care too much, as long as you aren't making trouble/being a nuisance. Just don't go around smoking and being super obvious about it and you should be good. Also keep in mind that California has a pretty big weed culture, and anything under an ounce is decriminalized, and most personal drug possession is just a misdemeanor."

Scary at the time, cool to look back on, but the point of what I'm saying is that you should take your time and breathe slowly a few times before you take your hit, and after you take your hit. It's important to keep your oxygen intake normal, as this provides the safest way of smoking.  Being safe comes first, having fun comes second."

Your heart beats faster, your metabolism goes up, etc. Being high pretty much puts your body into a ""high"" state of functioning. Since you have the backstory of how long this escapade took, I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say you didn't eat anything substantial in between smoke sessions and possibly even not enough water and you were dehydrated. Like others have said, though, the bong rip probably deprived your body of oxygen for a little too long, and your body was so out of fuel from working at such a high functioning state, it couldn't sustain normal bodily functions without oxygen for that long and you momentarily blacked out.   This happens to me sometimes if I smoke without eating/drinking enough. This happens to my girlfriend ALL the time but usually it's mild mini blackouts, but we've been to concerts and she's smoked a lot and not had access to food if she was feeling faint and water is hard to get at $4+ a bottle in the middle of a huge crowd of bodies creating lots of heat, making things worse haha.   Moral of the story, make sure you're eating a good meal before getting THAT stoned and bring water. Water is great because cottonmouth and you deserve dehydrate soooooo fast when you're smoking."

Everyone who tried them said after one they were on there ass the rest of the day.

My advice is eat the gummies either directly before eating a medium sized meal, or directly after. The trickiest part about edibles is that they can take 1-2 hours before reaching full effect (and some people even longer...) So it can be risky to go 'well, i haven't felt anything yet and it's been almost 2 hours'.. you eat more, and 5 minutes later the first edibles hit you like a truck.  My advice is, for better or for worse, ride out whatever high you get from the first edibles"

After a while, you'll understand just how marijuana affects you and how you can plan your sessions around those effects accordingly.  If you get high and you are feeling jittery, hyperactive, etc., so much so that it's uncomfortable, do this:   Take a deep breath, and make a damn plan.   I have repeated this mantra through and through for each and every one of my highs, good or bad, and it hasn't failed me yet. I was vaping pretty heavily just the other night, and didn't realize that I was focusing and concentrating super hard on what I was doing. When I gained some lucidity for a second, I noticed that I was almost hyperventilating and that my heart was pounding.

saplings,3dl1z3,PKfire12,10,Fri Jul 17 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"Depressant has nothing to do with feeling depressed,  it means it depresses your central nervous system meaning things like feeling sleepy,  pain relief and having trouble thinking right.

saplings,3djy7g,__________________l,11,Thu Jul 16 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"From my somewhat limited understanding of joints, you guys probably didn't pack it tightly enough. Very loosely packed joints can light too fast, and air pockets inside the bud can do the same thing. After you pack your joint, roll it around a few times to compact the weed a bit before you seal it. I like to take a pencil and push the fresh ground closer to the crutch with the tip of it.  Also, a lot of people don't tell you this, but you're not supposed to see a flame on the end of your joint, and you shouldn't start with one either unless it's burning off the excess paper on the end. You should have a light smoldering going on, like the end of a stick of incense; it should be smoking, but not on fire. The actual ""combustion"" of the joint comes from when you hit it, increasing airflow and oxygen intake."

Not to say it isn't possible, but the gist of what I'm saying is that you're fine.  The first handful of times you get stoned will be different than after you've been smoking for a while, both in the short-term and ""long-term"". Marijuana is not a miracle cure-all with no bad side-effects, but it does open up your mind in some different ways. Since you just started out, you are probably not used to this sensation yet, nor is your body (more specifically your brain) used to changing its chemistry and normal processes yet.  If you had a good time while you were stoned, I would say do it again, just wait for a couple weeks from now until you normalize again.  Also, just so you know, that ""lingering weirdness"" is pretty common among tokers. I can be weird for up to 2 days after the day I get high."

If you're wanting a bit more, take another puff wait five minutes, etc etc. Just dont wanna overwhelm yourself, especially considering you have little to no tolerance.    Hell, i'm a pretty seasoned toker, and from time to time, i get too high, and it can be a bit overwhelming. Just know your limits, and try to stick to them."

As someone else mentioned you can use one of those long lighters (the kind you use to light a candle or grill) and while big it does work fine.

saplings,3dinqo,Afrew,11,Thu Jul 16 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"/u/IAmFern and /u/Hexavxozy provide great advice for preparing the joint; refer to them for that information. However, ""canoeing"", as at least the Canadians I know call it, can prove to be a problem even with the best-rolled joints if you inhale on it like a cigarette. If you find your cherry growing uneven, and a canoe is forming in your joint, it might sound a little gross but you can wet your finger with your tongue and create a wet ring just beneath the lowest point on the cherry, and this will give the other side of the cherry time to catch up. The heat will eventually dry your saliva, and the cherry will be much more even for the rest of the joint."
saplings,3dinqo,sevencorvina,5,Thu Jul 16 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"we actually do a pre-emptive 'joint lick' to help prevent the runs from forming in the first place.

saplings,3dinqo,Bigfrostynugs,5,Thu Jul 16 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"Make sure it's well ground up.  It doesn't have to be a powder, but it should be fairly fine.   Next, take the time to pack it well.   Roll it a bit between your fingers, pack down, repeat a few times til it's nice and uniform.   Finally, it should be rolled fairly snug, but not so tight that air can't get through.   Also, it's easier with thicker joints than thin ones.  Hope that helps."

saplings,3dims8,Afrew,14,Thu Jul 16 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"Dude, it sucks, and I mean it really sucks, sucks terribly, to be ripped off, but, unfortunately, that's what you sometimes get in the illegal drug business, and there's nothing you can do about it. It just comes with the territory. The only thing you can do is take a deep breath, save your money, and try again some other time (from a different dealer, obviously).  Try to make friends with middlemen who have close relationships with their dealers. My middleman (my first dealer, before I got a new guy) was really close friends with his supplier, so he always got high-quality stuff on the cheap, which, in turn, made my purchases from him very cheap. After he ended up getting out of the game, I got a new dealer who I know for a fact is a really cool dude, and he charges less for the same, if not better, quality of stuff. He's also good friends with my best friend, so it's a great circle for me to be involved in.  The only thing you can really do is tell your friend to never go to that dealer again. There are obviously ""other"" options, but this is the safest and the most civil. Try to build new and better connections if possible.   A lot of people, especially on this subreddit, unfortunately, seem to be in the habit of demonizing weed dealers, making them out to be con-artist douchebags who only look out for Number 1, but that's really not true, at least not in any of the instances I've seen. My first guy was excellent, his supplier was great, and my current guy I don't even think cares about the money all that much, he just seems to be involved in the culture of it.

We both have jobs and we both smoke every single day. If you really want to be a daily smoker you can. Just get through high school man trust me. In the long term your relationship with your parents is so much more important than the 1 year of smoking. Take it easy find your balance.

Your parents don't sound like they're fanatical or ideologists. They just want their son to succeed and see that pot was too much of a priority for you when you weren't doing well scholastically.   Have an honest conversation with them. Ask THEM for advice and for help. Show them you feel better when you smoke. Work with them to set some goals for yourself and work towards completing those goals.  I was in a similar boat as you. Got high every day. Slacked off and started working full time hours when I was 16. I dropped out of school and was going nowhere fast. I ended up joining the Navy on a whim because I was scared of being a deadbeat.

Dude, you blatantly disobeyed them when they told you to stop smoking pot. Considering they have smoked pot in the past and can already understand where you're coming from, it's not only irresponsible, but also disrespectful, not to mention dishonest, to just do away with their advice like that. If you are living in their house, probably rent-free, then you should show them the respect of following their rules. The great thing about becoming an adult is that you get to make your own rules at that point, but until that point comes you still have to listen to others. It sucks, but that's how it is.  Weed isn't a miracle cure-all with no bad side-effects like people want it to be. It is a drug, and when a drug can't be used responsibly, you shouldn't do it at all. You can show them that you can control yourself with pot by not doing pot, at least until you are living in your own dwelling."

Having a window open would be a good idea and making sure any other weed you had is packed away right.  I never had an issue with it until this summer.

You definitely want something that is made out of glass so maybe something like http://bit.ly/1K7CQku   Although I don't have experience with buying a bong personally, I've known friends who have and they have always told me that it is easier to buy a piece (like a bong) in a local headshop/smokeshop. This is because when you buy it in a shop many times they allow you to hold it and get a closer look at what you will be spending your money on.   I hope you are able to swoop on a cool new piece!

Other than my own, I really don't use bongs very often, but I do find them enjoyable. If you are new to bongs, I would highly recommend getting one that is simple and sturdy. If you end up disliking it, you hardly paid anything for it, and you don't have all of these extra trinkets and baubles to worry about as you try to resell it or store it. There is a headshop in the mall near where I live that frequently has a lot of really cool bongs added to the inventory, so that's where I got my coffee mug-sized one. It was only $20, and I ended up really enjoying it.  If I was going to get a bigger bong though, it would be this one from Thick Ass Glass. Honestly, I've been eyeing it for a while now, and there is currently a great sale on it. It's a beaker-style bong, meaning it has a nice, wide base, and it's also 10mm thick, which is honestly unheard of for a bong, lol. A 10mm thick body and base means that you would really have to work on chipping, cracking, or breaking this thing. I would definitely recommend looking into it.

And also from reading the other posts in this thread, this bong offers the same types of percs, if not more, for a significantly cheaper price.

saplings,3daxci,Trees4twenty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"Well do you know why he has seizures?  That is a big factor most of the time.    Also keep in mind the odd part with cannabis is it affects everyone differently so one person might have the munchies while the other gets tired.  So when it comes to strains while they have a generalization effect that comes with them, it can always be different.  Now when it comes to using different strains you want to get a strain that is low or next to none on THC and high on CBD.  The two most popular strains are going to be Charlotte's web or ACDC.  Charlotte's webs is more famous throughout the United States (if that is where you reside), while ACDC is going to be more famous on the west coast (mainly California).  For obtaining it do the following in this order.   Look to see if you have medical marijuana available in your state, country, or provinces.  If yes then have your cousin look into getting a prescription from a medical doctor. Medical is better than recreational because you can a majority of the time grow your own, and it is also much cheaper than recreational. If you have recreational marijuana call the closest dispensary to you and ask if they have strains with next to zero THC and only high in CBD for seizures. If you do not have either available well you need to find local dealers.  You can ask around for dealers that have only high CDB strains with low THC.   If you can not find any low THC and high CDB strains then I would look into getting just any strain you can and going from there.  Having a low THC strain will greatly limit (and in some completely eliminate) any of the psychoactive effects.  These would be the munchies, being tired, slow thoughts, and other effects that come from cannabis.   If you are curious why all strains are not low in THC it is because the THC does help with other ailments people have.  From curing those with chron's disease, to helping eliminate dreams associated with PTSD.  Feel free to ask any other questions you have.  I can also direct you to nearby places if you want help, but I will do that via private message as I do not want to post links that could come across as advertising :)."

But a good starting hit is around the size of a B.B. from a bb gun. That small, then work up. Now what youre going to have to do is look up pictures of wax and study their consistency. Get to know what shatter looks like. Get to know what crumble and honeycomb wax looks like. This will help u to immediately identify by sight if the wax your friend has in on par with the good shit. Now NEVER buy any wax that is that is called taffy or pull n snap. That shit is always garbage amd they didnt purge it right. If what your friend has looks like what you find on the internet under crumble, honeycomb and it smells great then buy it. I leave out shatter because a lot of people suck at making shatter and end up not purging it well enough. My go to is honeycomb wax. Also if what your friend has looks lie a goopy liquid or if it has any liquid or taffy like consistency, tell your friend to get the fuck out with that shit and dont buy it. Now about price. Usually a guy here in CA will charge 20 for some cheap goopy shit he made in a hurry to make some extra cash and doesnt know what hes doing. After years of price checking anything below 20 a gram, their most likey not going to have that bomb of wax. Now like $25-35 a gram is usually the range where youll find people have good to great quality wax. I would never pay more than 30 a gram for bomb wax personally. But depending on your state and the availa ility your friend could possibly charge up to like 40 a gram. Thats all i got without making this thing an even bigger wall of text. I just hate seeing people get ripped off buying wax kuz they are new to it like i did. Good luck man"

saplings,3d6epr,ThrowAway420BlazeIt1,3,Mon Jul 13 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, with a waterfall/gravity bong, you are taking in a certain amount of weed all at once.  With a joint, you are taking in more over a longer period of time, which keeps you higher longer, but not shocking your system all at once like gravs.  For me, the scale, going from shortest lasting high to longest, is: gravity bong, bong, bubbler, bowl/joint.  I prefer bubblers and bowls for this reason (and others)."
saplings,3d6epr,Hybyscus,7,Tue Jul 14 05:50:42 2015 UTC,"Smoking devices that have any type of water filtration cool off your smoke, allowing you to take a bigger hit. In the specific instance of bottle based bongs, you have a larger chamber that can be milked up with smoke, resulting in large hits. In rolled up variants of smoking, the bud has been compacted into a cylinder shape. The fact that the bud has been compacted and is kept smoking by one tiny ember on the end results in a slower burn. When smoking out of piece, you're continually relighting your bowl with a lighter. A lighter burns up weed faster than a slow burning ember. Hope I answered your question."

saplings,3d5sm3,freshdankmemes,18,Mon Jul 13 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Apologize in advance for the language, but here's something that might help you - I didn't write it but I have it saved on my phone.   This is a guide I created when I went to a boarding school that tested randomly for 4 years. You can skip this paragraph if you already trust me. Zero tolerance, one strike and you're out. I would smoke on breaks and come back, so I needed to use everything in my power to make sure that I wouldn't be sent home. I have done copious amounts of in depth research (I seriously had no life at one point) to find out which methods are myths as opposed to jail savers. The point is that my ass made it to college after many close calls. I don't go into much detail in this guide cause most people don't care, so if you are curious, just google it bitch. Take notes, cause this took a lot of effort.   First of all, stop smoking immediately, no matter how much time you have, if you want the absolute highest chance of passing. This should be obvious, but I always get asked questions like ""when should I stop?"" Well, I would say that the all time average would be about 3-4 weeks, but there are way too many variables to really use that as a true guideline so keep that in mind. Just think of it as a test that you aren't addicted or something... the challenge will be good for you even if you do think that a bong rip is on par with a sip from the fountain of youth.  Second, don't stress. Try to relax. I won't go into detail here but stress really does have a huge and underestimated effect on your physical state, which will in turn cause your ""cleansing rate"" to be much much slower. Find something else to focus on instead of that test. Consider setting reminders on your phone so you don't have to think about it.   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON CLEANSING PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY BLENDS! think about how easy it is to make money of desperate people trying to pass drug tests; like taking candy from a baby. Companies have no reason/way to guarantee cleansing products work cause dumbass people will buy it anyway. These products either:  A: do the same shit I'm telling you to do for more $$  B: have a banned and detectible chemical/plant that would otherwise MAYBE help you pass (e.g. goldenseal)  C: just plain don't work at all.   start writing things down here.   Get a HEALTHY but above average serving of fiber every day (note that a sudden/dramatic change in fiber will make it feel like a tsunami is about to come out of your asshole). Exercise heavily up until 2-4 days before the test, THEN eat a lot of fatty ass foods. A sugary/carb heavy diet before this 2-4 day period will significantly lower the effect of the fiber and exercise; the point of this is to burn as much fat as you can, poop it out with fiber, and then quickly add another layer of clean fat on top right before you take the test. Fiber has other beneficial effects that I won't get into so if you are a skinny mf and choose to skip the exercise, at least still eat some fiber.   eat gelatin (main ingredient in jello, has a lot of fast-acting fiber) the night before and the morning of the test, assuming you have the time to digest it. You can buy raw gelatin at the grocery store which should be easy to stuff into your body like a thanksgiving turkey. Other than the fiber, it's a mystery as to why this works so well, but... if there is one piece of advice you should follow, it is this one.   Also, on the day of the test, (most important)  Pee in the morning. Your first piss of the day is dirtier than that filthy zeta you probably boned after you finished a case race with your good 'ol pledge class. Drink enough water fully stock an African tribe's watering hole (but seriously, not TOO much cause you can die from that shit), eat as much vitamin b and creatine as you can safely consume to make the test think that you didn't drink that much water. I can't give exact amounts so just do a little research. Note that you will need time to digest. How much? It varies widely,  but eating things in the morning that digest quickly will help lower the time that is necessary to utilize nutrients.   When you go to the toilet: pee in the toilet first, then in the cup, then finish off in the toilet. Kind of like fucking over the local whore. No suspicions will be raised, unless they expect you to hand over an overflowing cup of piss, which my friend did one time as a big ""fuck you"" to my school. You want the clean ""middle stream"" of piss, because the beginning and end have less water and more filth (stuff rests at the bottom of your kidneys).  Walk out confidently with that cup in your hand. Hold that frothy piss like a gold medal and don't make them suspicious. Look 'em in the eye as they retrieve your stinky excrement.   None of this is a complete guarantee; all just ways to keep the amount of THC in the cup to a bare minimum. Good luck dumbass."

(e.g. by what % it typically reduces the presence of metabolites) Not a big deal if not, I'm just trying to get a ballpark estimate as to the amount of leeway the method grants me since passing a home test one day doesn't guarantee I'll pass a lab test the next.  Edit: I should probably mention that I plan on taking a home test using my ""worst"" pee possible (first of the day, beginning of stream, undiluted, etc.) to give myself an idea of where I'm at in a worst case scenario. I'm curious about dilution effectiveness because, assuming I pass a home test, it affords an additional ""buffer zone"" under the cutoff level and I'd like to know the general size of that buffer zone as a means of reassurance."

As for the weed, I can't tell you if you did it right or wrong, I've never done it successfully but only tried once or twice with like, a gram of weed as a dumb teen lol.

This led to entire weeks of smoking all day, every day between exam periods - fun, but not the best for my health or relationships. A few of the things I noticed were:   I was coughing way more frequently than in the past (annoying, but manageable) I became very apathetic about a number of things, ranging from schoolwork to making time to hang out with friends. I was much more relaxed because of this, but I sort of became a hermit at times and that had a negative impact on some of my friendships I spent a lot of money on bud and delivery I became much more out of shape between the increasingly sedentary lifestyle and poor diet   Overall, I probably won't stop smoking, but I definitely have no plans to return to that lifestyle.

saplings,3d0qng,NewbieWeedGuy,7,Sun Jul 12 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"I've only ever made brownies, but it's pretty much all the same as far as edibles go. Whatever you decide, I would go the oil route over butter, since butter is a bit harder and requires more IMO. It will absolutely stink up the whole place for hours, without a doubt. The cakes themselves will not smell, but they usually taste a little like it. I'd recommend buying a vaporizer instead, they smell very little, are very efficient in terms of quantity, and are generally not as conspicuous as glass pieces. Also if you do make edibles, refrigerate them or they lose potency over time."
saplings,3d0qng,ARQBZAK,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"Also if you do make edibles, refrigerate them or they lose potency over time.   Should I just put them in the normal refrigerator or should I freeze them completely if I dont eat them for some days?"

saplings,3d0qng,Whynot_,2,Sun Jul 12 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"Hi.   Take as much good quality weed as you can find and grind it quite fine. Make sure there are no big chunks.  Preheat oven to 220F or ~105C.  Put the finely ground herb inside a square of aluminum foil and tightly seal.  edit: or just use a mason jar Put this inside a small oven-safe container (I use a loaf pan) and put another piece of aluminum foil on top, TIGHTLY. Make sure there are no rips, holes, or open areas. You can use 2 pieces to be safe. Put this in the oven for 30 minutes. Then remove the entire container and let it sit until cool. Make sure to let it cool, as the vapors need to settle. Otherwise it will smell a lot. It should not smell at all at this point... make sure the oven stays on. Once cooled, get some oil. I use coconut oil. Butter also works. Ghee as well. Use about a tablespoon per gram of herb. Coconut oil is one of the best, but don't use olive oil. Take a mason jar and put the oil into it. Now carefully open the loaf pan and small aluminum packet you made earlier, mix it into the oil in the mason jar, and cover that tightly with aluminum foil. --Note: if you want the product to be stronger, also add about a tablespoon of soy lecithin and stir well, this helps with digestion and leads to a better high in my experience-- Make sure you're quick on the last step, sealing quickly eliminates strong odors. It would be even better if you did this near a stove and had a ventilation hood above. Or open a window. Put the jar inside the loaf pan and cover with aluminum foil again. Put it back in the oven for 20 minutes at the same temperature as before. After 20 minutes, remove the entire thing from the oven and let it cool. You can stop here and continue at another time or another day if you need to. You can also strain here if you like, but I don't. This is why you ground it finely earlier.   The first time in the oven ""decarboxylates"" the herb. Then you let the vapors settle back into the plant matter when it cools. Then the oil and optional lecithin bind with the THC that you activated earlier when you mix them and put them into the oven again. Then letting them cool allows everything to settle once more. I let it cool and store it until I'm ready to make edibles. This oil is really good, IMO. You COULD just eat it straight as is but I wouldn't. Continue below.  The day before I'm ready to use it, I put my jar into the freezer and let the mixture freeze. This is anecdotally better for potency.  Then I let the jar defrost (set the jar onto something like a dish towel or pot holder to be safe and prevent it shattering somehow) and prepare a brownie mix that calls for oil. If you use a half oz of mj and a tablespoon of oil per gram as I suggested, it should be 8 tablespoons. This is half a cup and the amount needed for brownies. If you have more or less, put it in a measuring cup and add extra or use just a little less. Drink the extra or something haha. The brownies shouldn't smell if you did everything right.  This whole process should only take 4 hours if you do it all at once. It never smells for me.  Depending on how much mj you use is how big each serving of brownie should be. I usually consider about 1/2 to 3/4 gram per serving good but you may like more or less.  Also, if you're worried, just cook popcorn near the end of the process and that should cover the smell. And if you make it while you make the brownies/when you eat one you can have snacks to go with your high"
saplings,3d0qng,Whynot_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:32:45 2015 UTC,Good to know thank you!  It´s also a great idea to put popcorn or something else smelly there to take over the weed odor.
saplings,3d0qng,Whynot_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"you said below you don't care how it tastes, here's another option...  Take a mason jar and put the ground weed very fine. Add a tablespoon of oil per gram. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, tight! Put in a 220F, ~105C oven for an hour. Let it cool.  While it's cooling warm milk on low heat on the stove. Add cocoa and sugar and make hot chocolate. Serve the hot chocolate with all the oil mixed in once the oil has cooled. It's fairly quick and if you just drink it really fast you should have no problems.  edit: the soy lecithin would still be a good addition, just put it in at the beginning too  edit #2: also, make sure to eat something protein/carby about 20 to 30 minutes before you eat the weed. ""first pass metabolism"" and all that. It helps make it work better/stronger. just dont eat too much. maybe a small sandwich. that is ideal. then wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating the hot cocoa, sort of like a dessert. same applies to the brownies above"

saplings,3d0qng,Brewer_Ent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"So I found out that I'm immune to edibles. I tried Afrews fast edible link: http://beyondchronic.com/2012/01/how-to-blast-off-nutella-firecrackers/  And I did it exactly like that, but nothing. Was not even a little bit high. Was reading the comments there and found out some people are just immune to edibles. So I think I'm one of these people - because it did not work. So I guess... there is no point to try out other edibles solutions if you immune to that right?  This is really not fair. I'm kind of upset"
saplings,3d0qng,Brewer_Ent,2,Sat Jul 18 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on a couple things.  You say     I'm a very bad smoker   does that mean you have smoked before? Have you been high before?  Did you add any oil to the Nutella? Was the Nutella fresh? What temperature did you use? How long did you cook it?  Did you eat before you had the edible or did you do it on an empty stomach? If yes, how long before?  Like I said above, edibles are quite variable and not precise nor do I get the same experience every time. It depends on your liver function, metabolism, mood, temperature of oven, etc etc etc. When you cook it, the THCa has to ""decarboxylate"" into THC and bond to the fat molecules in the edible, which then has to maintain and contain those molecules until you eat it, then make it all the way to the liver to be processed and (hopefully) make you high.  There's lots of variables and uncertainties. I wouldn't say that you are immune to edibles so much as that particular experience did not work out as you would have liked. I understand, that's happened to me many times. I've wasted like 4 or 5 grams at once and nothing, afterward I had wished I just smoked. So... Edibles are only worth it if you have a LOT of extra weed or if that's the only way you can consume the herb (in my opinion).  In conclusion, I wouldn't write edibles off entirely but they are certainly expensive, time consuming, and do not give you the exact same effects as smoking/vaporizing which absorbs THC through the lungs into the bloodstream much quicker at much higher concentrations (not necessarily volume though) than edibles with much less uncertainty.  Let me know how I can help, if I can."
saplings,3d0qng,Brewer_Ent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"does that mean you have smoked before? Have you been high before?   When I smoked I was high.  Alright so here is how I made this edible:  I was using 1g weed. I smoked that some weeks ago and I was high, so the weed should fine fine I thought. Fresh nutella, just bought it on the same day I was going to make the edible. I was reading stuff about coconut oil, so I also bought that. Well in the shops here in my country actually they did not have coconut""oil"", they got coconut""fat"" - I assume it´s the same, because no oil was found and they told me this is the fat that you use to cook and stuff. It was not liquid, it was like white chocolate - at first you have to heat that up if you want to have it liquid, well like butter you know. So I did put my 1g weed in a glass, after that did heat up my coconutfat somewhere else (not on the same glass) and was putting a little of this liquid fat in the glass and mixed it with the weed. Reading your comment about soy lecithin, I did also put there some lecithin. After that I made 2 crackers. 0.5g weed on the one and 0.5g on the other one, both with fresh nutella and so on. Pre heated the oven for 120 celsius (should be something like 250F), added aluminum foil around my 2 crackers and put them in the oven. NOW because I was reading some people are talking about 20min oven time, others 30min I did a good trick: the first cracker I took out after 22min the other one after 32min - so I had at least one with the perfect temperature. After that I waited an hour and ate one half of the 22min cracker and one half of the 32min cracker.  Now I waited an hour and nothing :( So after that I ate the rest of them. And nothing. Maybe I was after some hours a little bit tired, I dont know. It was a long day, so maybe it´s not even because of the weed. I was for sure not high or something like that.  But as I understand that is for some people totally normal. Was reading about a guy who made some edibles, gave the same edible to different people and some reacted a were high and others did not recognize anything. It´s too bad that I'm probably one of them, because I like this edible idea - this solution with the crackers was really easy and did not smell very strong.  Maybe another problem is that I'm kind of a big guy. Over 2 meters and stuff like that, usually I also need to drink a little bit more than other people to get drunk."
saplings,3d0qng,Afrew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. That's what coconut oil is like, and the rest you did perfectly as far as I can tell, so you could be right. The only other possibility is the timing of when exactly you ate it. I'm not too sure on when the ideal period is, i.e. after eating/before eating/23.34 minutes after a meal/etc.  I'm sorry to hear about this experience not going well though. Maybe it'll work if you tried again but I really don't know."
saplings,3d0qng,Afrew,2,Sun Jul 19 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Since cooking has been covered a few times, vaporizing would be good too. Have to get a unit but after that it's pretty straightforward. Desktop unit like the Arizer Extreme Q is nice for home use (very little if any smell)  and not too expensive, but there are a lot of portables that work just as well, are a lot more incognito, and they go on sale quite a bit.  /r/vaporents is a good place to start looking at them if you're interested. Beyond that I'd say edibles are your best bet."

The Arizer Solo, portable vape, went on sale for $80 a little while back I believe and the others do occasionally, but anything below that price point is usually a little low on the quality scale. The Crafty, Flowermate, Air Solo, all pretty good portables at the lower end of prices.  Just avoid conduction style vapes. With convection heated air moves over the herb to vape it. Conduction vapes usually burn it, so basically they act like an electric pipe."

Didn't even know flowermate made pen vapes. If it does burn it though, it will smell about as bad as a pipe."

I've made these multiple times and have gotten excellent results every time. Don't listen to these people who say you have to decarboxylate and do all this crazy stuff beforehand, because it really is unnecessary.

saplings,3d0qng,JuicyJason1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"I answered above and mentioned using oil. I've made firecrackers before too. I prefer oil.  They (firecrackers) are more variable and less precise in my experience but the nutella ones are actually quite tasty. Stay away from ones made with peanut butter, IMO they taste disgusting.  I would mix in some coconut oil and soy lecithin granules into the nutella before mixing in the weed. Make sure they are tightly wrapped with foil, once again for smell.  These don't smell either and take much less time than oil. The longer mine sat around, the more potent they seemed to be. Just make sure you use proper temperatures (I'd use oven temp. of 250F for firecrackers rather than the 230F I recommended for oil because the nutella lowers the overall temperature of the weed and inhibits decarboxylation. Like Afrew says, decarboxylation is mandatory at SOME point of the process but doesn't have to be done beforehand. I just prefer to do so when I make oil)and let them cool completely before unwrapping.  I agree with his response. If you are only going to use mj once in a while, making brownies or oil is certainly not worth it. I made firecrackers when I had to be stealthy and they work if done properly.   Preheat oven to 250F. Get some sheets of aluminum foil. Get some graham squares.  Get 1 gram mj per 2 squares / per 1 sandwich. Get a bowl and put a couple spoonfuls of Nutella. Enough to spread about a centimeter or two thick on the grahams times # of grams of mj. Mix in a teaspoon of coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon of soy lecithin granules. Put a graham onto aluminum foil sheet, spread nutella mixture onto it.  Sprinkle a gram of mj ground very finely. Equivalent to about a teaspoon of herb. Mix it into the nutella on top of cracker and make sure no herb remains on the spoon. Put another graham on top. Seal carefully with aluminum foil. I use 2 layers to be safe. Be careful of nutella oozing out of the sides of the crackers while wrapping. Place in 250F oven for about 30 minutes. Let it cool completely before unwrapping. Optional: Allow it to sit for about a week before consuming. Make sure to store in a cool, dry place preferably in a ziploc bag. Or make 10 and do that. Whatever. I wouldn't keep them unrefrigerated for longer than 2 weeks without eating though.   Enjoy!"

It smells a lot.  It smells but not how cannabis does, it won't like fill a room. Just keep it covered and you'll be good.  Depends on the quality of your bud, but if edibles are made right 2g can be 10-20 doses. If most people don't smoke in your country you probably don't have access to the highest quality though, so 2g would probably be 4-8 doses."

saplings,3d39bk,Diapy,2,Mon Jul 13 04:54:00 2015 UTC,"It would depend on how many milligrams of THC is in the edible. Usually with 25mg you should be able to feel it, I have been smoking for almost 2 years now and the most I have ever taken is 80mg, usually I will take 50mg and get a nice comfortable high from it. Edibles take close to an hour to kick in, I usually feel it in 45 minutes, as I am a very slender guy, a few of my heavier friends can take up to an hour and a half to 2 hours to feel it. I am pretty sure how fast you feel it has to do with body weight. Be careful going into it though, edibles are STRONG, much more intense than a normal high. They also last a very long time, usually I am HIGH for 5 hours, but with the come down and everything the whole experience can sometimes be 8 hours long.

saplings,3d39bk,Afrew,2,Mon Jul 13 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"This recipe for Old Hippie's Firecrackers is excellent. I've made them on multiple occasions and they've worked perfectly every time. This method is significantly easier and more cost-effective than basically any other method for edibles I've ever seen, and you still get a very potent, albeit rudimentary, edible.   If you choose to use this recipe (which I highly recommend if you haven't had edibles before), only eat half of the finished product. Old Hippie recommends eating a quarter of it, but I've tried half at a time and I've tried a quarter at a time, and I've had much better results out of eating a half. Put the other half in your fridge for some other day.  Once you eat your half of it, it'll take about 45 minutes to 1 hour to kick in. For me, I can start to feel it slightly after about 20 minutes, and then it kicks it into high-gear after 45 - 60 minutes, but that just goes to show you how everyone is different.   Some people won't feel anything at all for over an hour, and then will suddenly get super stoned. With that said, don't eat more if it feels like it isn't working. If you smoke too much, you can just wait it out and be fine. With edibles, you don't get that option. You will be stoned for at least 3 hours straight with very little to no come-down during that time. Again, if it feels like it isn't working, just be patient. Like I said, everyone is different."

saplings,3d0tms,DrQuaid,2,Sun Jul 12 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"No. If you heat the nail correctly (between 690 and 800 degrees) you are vaporizing your concentrates. Thats why enails work so well, and you can taste your dabs more. If you heat your nail to red hot and while its still red dab your concentrate, you may ""flash"" your concentrate, effectively burning cannabinoids and terpenes, but it will still vaporize.   So to answer your question, a nail will vaporize your dab at correct temps."

saplings,3d1qpw,SELECT_FROM_names,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:37:52 2015 UTC,It would lower your tolerance for sure. In general the longer the time between smoking the higher you will get each time. Depending on your tolerance and metabolism it may take less time or more.
saplings,3d1qpw,Diapy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:41:29 2015 UTC,"I would have to say use the most out of what you got, that means smoke a small amount, but get as much of the smoke into your blood stream as possible. Take each hit into your lungs as deep as possible, then inhale deeper, then when you don't think you can inhale deeper, inhale a little deeper, then hold that hit just about as long as you can! If you do that with each and every hit I can bet that you will feel it more :)   Also something me and my buds (pun intended) would do would be to take in the hit as deep as you could, then, with the smoke still in your lungs, cough. Coughing with the smoke in your lungs will make it absorb better into your lungs, BUT be warned, it will make you cough HARD. Which is also a good thing, when you cough hard, your blood will travel quicker through your body, making that sweet good good reach your brain much faster. This will give you a sort of ""train wreck"" feeling, as if the high has actually freight trained you straight into the face. DONT DO THIS TO MUCH THOUGH! Your throat will hurt baddd, and trust me, a sore throat and dry mouth is a shitty combo. Be careful, but happy tokin :)"

For one thing, there's paper that burns whereas in pipes you're just smoking the cannabis. Another thing, the j continously stays lit, and a lot of it at once for that matter. If you take a decent drag, I'd compare it to smoking a whole snap in a bowl all at once. Also, the joint gets more harsh the farther down it gets smoked, as resin starts building up (in minute amounts, mind you) on the unsmoked plant matter waiting to be lit. Not to mention it gets shorter so the smoke has less time and room to cool off before reaching your mouth and lungs."

Don't let your bong or other pieces get smelly, make sure you put them in something like a bag, and ALWAYS POUR YOUR BONG WATER OUT. Never reuse bong water. Also, i heard putting hot water in bongs is nice.  Good idea on smoking outside (i would never smoke in someone's house unless they give me the okay). If you're outside though, you're probably not going to smell that much. Just don't let the smoke rub up on you and wash your hands and mouth, (if you have long hair) put your hair back or in a hat so it won't pick up the smell. Sunglasses or eye drops are a must.

I would have to say use the most out of what you got, that means smoke a small amount, but get as much of the smoke into your blood stream as possible. Take each hit into your lungs as deep as possible, (this means after you have inhaled the weed, take in a large breath of clean air BEFORE exhaling the original breath of weed) then inhale deeper, then when you don't think you can inhale deeper, inhale a little deeper, then hold that hit just about as long as you can! If you do that with each and every hit I can bet that you will feel it more :)  Also something me and my buds (pun intended) would do would be to take in the hit as deep as you could, then, with the smoke still in your lungs, cough. Coughing with the smoke in your lungs will make it absorb better into your lungs, BUT be warned, it will make you cough HARD. Which is also a good thing, when you cough hard, your blood will travel quicker through your body, making that sweet good good reach your brain much faster. This will give you a sort of ""train wreck"" feeling, as if the high has actually freight trained you straight into the face. DONT DO THIS TO MUCH THOUGH! Your throat will hurt baddd, and trust me, a sore throat and dry mouth is a shitty combo. Be careful, but happy tokin :)"

The fact that the firecrackers are tightly wrapped in foil it shouldn't leak much smell, I could not smell it outside unless I opened the mini oven door, and the smell was very faint. If you want to make them inside, I figure the smell should be gone in less than an hour (YMMV) with some windows open and fans).  Today I decarbed weed using the same method (mini oven outside) but not wrapped in foil, which smelled a lot more but again only if you opened the oven door. It would smell a lot more inside I'm guessing, but should be gone after a few hours or so.

I didnt start until I was 19. All my other friends that smoke started when they were 12 or even younger. My hypothesis is this I know drugs affect a developing mind a lot more than someone who is 18 or older. The brain will be more receptive to whatever drug you use at a young age versus someone who is older. I wonder if thats the reason why I sober up so quickly.

saplings,3cqwin,undergroundathiest,3,Fri Jul 10 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I've been experimenting on this for a while now.   I started with a Zippo, but the size of it didn't allow as much precision as I wanted for cornering, even with the wick set as low as possible.   I graduated to a Bic, which was pretty good precision-wise but the shape meant that unless I was using a large bowl, tamping with it was awkward. Tried a Bic mini, same result.   I bought a Clipper, but the wheel was too tight resulting in a mild pain after a long sesh, and the flame was pretty large. The shape was perfect for tamping a lit bowl, though.   Finally, I picked up 5' of hemp wick. Perfect - small flame for very exact lighting. Very maneuverable. Tastes amazing. So I wrapped that around the Clipper since it has the best shape for smothering my bowl, and I'm extremely happy with this."

saplings,3cqwin,kissmyrobot,2,Fri Jul 10 11:42:51 2015 UTC,Some people might say Zippo but the flame is so large and it leaves so much of a lighter fluid taste then if you go that route use it with beeline/hemp wick.

saplings,3cqwin,leon__furious,2,Fri Jul 10 05:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are versions for the small bic too. It has a little wheel under where the bic would go to let the wick be spooled out with one finger, so it's a bit easier to use with one hand compared to wick wrapped around the bic"

saplings,3cmdyg,ILikeReefers,2,Thu Jul 9 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"More constricted openings = more bubbles = more diffusion = more drag/harder to suck. That said, you'll also get a smoother hit if you inhale at a medium speed, not so slow that you don't create a good stream of bubbles but not so fast that the smoke has no time to contact the water.  Personally, I've grown quite fond of my cheap little scientific piece with a honeycomb and turbine perc. Lovely diffusion for vaping or dabbing, and on the occasion where I do want to smoke some flower (I mostly avoid it because I don't like cleaning my bong as often), I put some crushed ice in and it hits smooth as butter; The benefit with the turbine is the water spins inside the main chamber and is cooled further by the glass walls which are cooled by ice. http://imgur.com/mbEChMj   I would say anything beyond 2-3 percs and you're going from function to form. More advanced percs like matrix or 20+ arm trees are really just showing off craftsmanship.  If smoothness is what you're going for, and you're looking on DHGate or just Chinese glass in general, then I would look primarily look at any combination of honeycomb and turbine or fritted disc."

Honeycombs are great all around, as long as you inspect them before hand to make sure it's blown correctly you'll be extremely happy with a honeycomb piece. There are tons of different percs, off the top of my head, showerhead, barrel, inline, stereo matrix, honeycomb, tree perc, waffle perc, swiss perc, seed of life and the list goes on.

But some people think its worth just throwing it because the majority of the bud has gone so why bother inhaling gross smoke when you can just reload your bong or whatever. Hope this helps!
saplings,3cju92,GoldenRubix,2,Wed Jul 8 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"Personal preference aside, you smoke it until it doesn't produce any smoke; a mix of black and white ash. A few suggestions:   Vape. If you don't like the taste of smoke then this is really the path to investigate. Pack the bowl with smaller, ""personal"" hits that you can burn through completely. You get the taste of a green hit without totally wasting your weed. Smoking isn't nearly as efficient than vaping, and to only get 1/4 to 1/2 of all the possible goodies by only taking a green hit, that's just wasteful in the minds of a lot of people."

saplings,3ci4pk,mudbutt20,8,Wed Jul 8 02:19:29 2015 UTC,"Welp, first thing is first: they aren't called dabs or concentrated thc. They're called cannabis extracts, called hash as a catch-all term, or are named based on the consistency of the extract: oil, budder, wax, and crumble, etc. (consistency is rarely a sign of quality, it's more about extraction style). Dabbing is a method of consumption and it's not the only one; you can smoke concentrates on a bed of flower or ash, or vaporize certain consistencies in an atomizer (think e-cigarette).  If you live an area with prohibition then I would worry that whatever you're getting is extracted by some hobbyist or fly by night operation who doesn't know or doesn't care how to prepare an extract properly. I wouldn't smoke it if I didn't know the extractor.  With commercial producers or more serious hobbyists, butane is purged with either a hot water bath or, now becoming more common even with smaller setups, vacuum purge which work even better. Some extract companies also lab test their product so they can label it as ""solvent free"" (there is no official body that verifies this, so take it as you may).  There are solventless concentrates on the market as well like bubble hash (also sometimes called ice wax, extracted with normal ice water and filter screens), CO2 (dry ice) extracted oil, and rosin tech. Keif and traditionally pressed hash are also solventless but do not melt so you can't dab them. You can easily process your own buds or hash at home using rosin tech to make cannabis oils, it's simply squeezing your buds on parchment paper using a hair flat iron.  So how safe are solvent-based cannabis extracts? Well, inhaling anything other than clean air is a calculated health risk. If you're confident in the source of the product then enjoy it, if you're weary about residual butane then skip concentrates or simply check out some solventless alternatives. That said, if you have a properly prepared extract it's healthier than smoking because you aren't combusting and inhaling useless plant matter and all the tars and carcinogens that come along for the ride; dabbing is basically vaporizing.  Poke around /r/cannabisextracts and I think you'll find that purging properly is a priority in the community."

saplings,3cfu1o,pugger99,2,Wed Jul 8 01:51:21 2015 UTC,How long of a gap was between your first time getting high and the second time. Sometimes if it is close together you still have THC in your body and you can get super high off of two or three tokes.
saplings,3cfu1o,PM_ME_YOUR_BOWL,2,Tue Jul 7 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"Try taking smaller hits just inhale a little at a time and maybe hit it every other rotation. To answer your question in the comments don't feel embarrasses or like an idiot. No one starts out with a high tolerance. I would be happy to have a low tolerance you can get high with less, that's a good thing. Everyone starts somewhere and its nothing to be ashamed of. Just try to better pace yourself, most people never say anything and if they do just reply with something along the lines of ""sure my tolerance is low but only one or two hits gets me high and you can't argue with good results"". Basically be positive and have fun you are normal there's nothing wrong with it."
saplings,3cfu1o,Lets_be_stoned,2,Tue Jul 7 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"It can also be a sociological thing. To put it simply since you're new to smoking, subconsciously you're not quite sure how to be acting, and it makes you uncomfortable being around other experienced people because you don't want to seem like the outcast and it can backfire. As you acclimate yourself over time you'll become more relaxed in your environment, and you'll sorta learn how to act from your friends and eventually you'll fit right in.

Since I have so many at-home tests and I won't need them after Friday, I tested myself five more times today without drinking more water than usual and I've passed them all, so that's reassuring.

It's almost like greening out, but you haven't smoked past the amount that would otherwise have been your limit.

saplings,3cd3ha,DatBowl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Bleach probably won't work. If it's a cheap at home test just drink a shit ton of water about an hour or two before you test. I mean to the point where you have to pee every half hour or so.   Basically the test doesn't look for THC it looks for the metabolites of THC that your body has broken down and stored in your fat cells. When the fat cells are burned an replaced the metabolites are cleaned up by your kidneys and come out in your pee. If you drink a bunch of water your body just purges it and you will pee clean and clear. Just make sure you pee about a half hour BEFORE you test just to clear out anything else stored in your kidneys.  As to top comment, don't worry about the niacin unless you are worried about your dad asking why your pee is clear. The Niacin makes it yellow, but not a good wholesome pee yellow. It turns it more of a Mt dew color. If the test is in a few weeks do the cardio but if it's within days you don't want to excersise because it just burns more fat and releases more of the metabolites.  If it is a test that gets sent to a lab you need to do a few more steps like loading up on creatine before the test because they'll know if it is dilute. There are some guides online that I have successfully used to pass lab tests. Hopefully all this helps"

Why would a new smoker need to know anything about different types of wraps and papers and junk? Rolling blunts and joints is definitely an ""advanced"" area, not a beginner area.

After your done smoking, open up the windows, and light an incense or spray air freshener. Leave the room sealed off from the rest of the house, so keep the towel under the door.

saplings,3c91b5,drdre398,18,Mon Jul 6 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"Hello there, been smoking for 8 years.  I have a plethora of knowledge for you.   First, yes. Absolutely it is worth it. It is not only great feeling, but actually beneficial to your health. Granted, smoking anything isn't good for your lungs, but if you were to use a vaporizer at the right temperature instead, then it would only be beneficial.  If you have anxiety, general pain, eating disorders, sleep problems, seizures, cancer etc. there is a strain of cannabis to treat it.  My brother spent 8 years in Iraq, his entire platoon is dead except for him. The only way he can feel normal and cope with his PTSD is when he uses a high Cannabidiol concentrated strain. It makes him feel normal again, and does 0 harm to him.  Something you might not know is that every psychoactive ingredient in cannabis already exists in your body. You have receptors for it on your cells.  I give you all of this information because I want you to understand how much of a positive this can really be in your life, and others. I want you to have facts.  You reach new levels of creativity, laugh maniacally over simple things. You enjoy every bit of life more than usual. Food tastes exponentially better. You enjoy the scenery, conversations, the arts, hiking, much more. You enjoy others company more.  This is honestly a miracle plant. Granted if you've never tried it before your going to be nervous. Your best bet is to do it in a safe place with people you trust. But you should know, you are in 0 danger from the plant. There has never been a marijuana-related death and you won't be the first one :)  If you have anxiety issues then you need a specific strain of the plants with the Cannabidiol in it. THC is the one that is the common ingredient that makes you highest, but it can also cause anxiety to become temporarily worse. It will be difficult to find a CBD(Cannabidiol) strain if you can't get direct from a patient or dispensary.   Either way though, if you can, try it. Don't put yourself in a dumb situation to try it, but when the right time comes along, definitely go for it. It's possible you won't feel anything the first time (this happens with many people) but don't give up. Eventually it will work and you'll watch spongebob, eat an entire box of cheeze-its, pass out on the floor and wake up surrounded by towers made out of oreos and half eaten frozen pizza that was never cooked."
saplings,3c91b5,yaboibillnye,2,Mon Jul 6 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"I laughed at the last sentence. It's not the actual trying it part, it's the part where I have to talk about something more ""intimate"" with someone who I rarely talk to, and then meet someone who I don't know. The ROA I was going to use is an edible called ""firecrackers"" for my first time. A small amount since I've heard how potent they are."
saplings,3c91b5,Dyslexic_Kitten,12,Mon Jul 6 01:50:04 2015 UTC,"This guy is calling it a miracle plant- which to some, and in some ways is true- but I don't want you to be mislead. There are negative effects of cannabis, especially if you are underage. It is possible to become dependent (although unlikely, and not physically) and it can affect your memory. Alot of people enjoy it, alot of people don't, and it varies by how much. Personally I enjoy it, but it isn't this wild, crazy, completely awesome, time-of-my-life experience for me. As for the process of getting it, when I first contacted someone it was pretty embarrassing and I felt dumb. I'm sure I got ripped off a bit too. But you shouldn't be scared. Worst case scenario, someone laughs a bit at you or says no. When buying, worst case scenario you get maybe 10$ less than you paid for. Getting caught by the police, however, is a pretty big deal, but if you be cautious there is a very low chance of that happening. I think it's worth trying it for sure though."
saplings,3c91b5,Toserand,2,Mon Jul 6 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to discount the possible negatives, thanks for covering my butt :)  This stems from the individual though. It's a psychological thing, nothing to do with the plant. You are definitely right in that in some people it sends them down a bad path.   But in my experience that all comes down to mental health and self-discipline. For example, I barely smoke during college semesters. And it doesn't bother me at all not to smoke, though I do miss it because I enjoy it. I focus, finish what I need to do, then I celebrate and relax afterwards. It's the perfect destressor.  You should be aware of all the possibilities of what can happen. Glad other people are pointing them out"

If I were helping someone with their first time, I'd invite them to take a small hit from a vaporizer or maybe my water pipe. The effects are almost instant which would eliminate the ""okay, is it working? when is it going to hit me?"" effect, as well as the guesswork in adding your botanical to your treat. I'd say to take a hit, take 10 minutes or so, see how you feel, then maybe take another. Edibles are considerably more powerful and provide a significantly different effect."

But it stems from a mental addiction, not a physical addiction; cannabis is not an addictive substance. Glad to hear you picked yourself up waffle!  If you're going the edibles route then here's a few suggestions. Again, do it in a safe place, but also don't take more because it ""isn't working"". Some edibles take awhile to kick in properly, often hours. They're also generally much stronger, like you said. Take baby steps until you find your comfort zone, don't get pressured into overdoing it.  I get that you're uncomfortable with the source. My suggestion is to wait until you have a trustworthy source and be open about it with them. I don't know what kind of neighborhood you live in, this might be your only good path. If you think your acquaintance is a good enough person to help you with this, give it a go. It helps to just be honest. But use discretion, and make sure your comfortable with it before you try talking to them. Be smart and don't create a bad situation for yourself"

In my situation, I'm using weed as more of a replacement for booze because it's way better and a lot healthier. If you believe that the risk is higher than it should be, and you haven't gotten to the point of knowing if you like drugs or not, it's probably not worth it.  However, with saying that if you can get some from a trusted source, or someone that can deliver, definitely try and get your hands on some. If you do happen to get pulled over though, just make sure your stash is out of sight and out of the glove compartment, and they shouldn't really have a reason to look any closer as long as they don't suspect anything. Avoiding the odor situation by keeping it in an airtight container while you drive is also a good idea.   If you have gone through the process of obtaining weed in your head and would prefer not to risk it (because it is always a risk) then you should probably just wait until it's legalized in your state until you buy it."

I didn't start buying for about 6 months after I first smoked. You could then decide if it's worth the risk to get high, without actually being in possession of any.   Edit: it's possible that the friend might just set everything up with his dealer, and then take your money and do the transaction himself, without you involved until the end.

saplings,3c9vbt,ld436,4,Mon Jul 6 07:54:11 2015 UTC,"People are saying 2020 but I think it's going to be a lot sooner than that. Colorado is swimming in weed money (categorized by illicit drug money to the feds) so none of that money can be used by the rest of the country. Especially now that the marriage equality issue has been solved, people are looking for an immediate problem to voice their concerns about after that cause passed with, well, rainbow colors. I'm guessing a lot of those people are going to be concentrating on the legalization of marijuana.   Edit: Also, politicians will probably push it through prior to the 2016 election so that Gay Marriage/Marijuana won't even be an issue. After having Marriage Equality and Cannabis Legalization being one of the main arguments for parties for the last 16 years, they're going to try to make both (as they've already succeeded with one) of those non-issues for '16."

As you do it more I found they tend to get less extreme.  You might want to try a different strain , seems like you had a lot of sativas which give a head high and can lead to hallucinations. You could try indicas which give more of the stereotypical lazy high.   I doubt the weed was laced very much. Even if you bought it off of a dealer he would be wasting money if he put some 'hardcore' drugs on it. Also the dealer might be hurting his sales if he gets known for lacing   Can't say I've experienced this but everyone's high is different ."

I remember my friend telling me that he hung out at his dealer's place (they are close friends) once and his dealer had made pot-brownies with about 100 grams of duff baked into it. Needless to say, my friend was rolling pretty hard after having one.  Edibles is really the only major and useful use for it. You can make cannabutter with it, but cannabutter is better made with fresh ground, rather than duff, because then you get the full spectrum of cannabinoids including the various forms of THC, rather than just the cannabinoids that give you a body high.  Actually, I got a vaporizer recently, and I quite enjoy smoking the duff. A lot of people say it's really not worth it, but the last couple of times I have used it in such a way, I've gotten a surprisingly strong reaction out of it, even after vaporizing it at 385F, which should have evaporated all of the THC by that point."

For a bong, you get a whole lot of smoke at once, therefore getting you a whole lot of high at once. If that doesn't really do it for you, either you don't have great weed, or you're just not a fan of the THC high experience.   The explanation for the fuzzy feeling from the bat is that you have ingested so little with just the one hit that you only feel a slight ""buzz"" like with alcohol.

saplings,3c5jaz,notverysuperdean,17,Sun Jul 5 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"I have a big problem with this as well. Whenever I smoke by myself (which is often the case), I nearly always end up with really terrible heartburn and indigestion the day after I smoke because I just can't help myself :(  But a few tips I got for this a long time ago (which I never actually follow, hypocritically enough) include:   Eat a small meal beforehand. Apparently marijuana may lower blood sugar levels, which can make you hungry. Counteract this by eating a little before you get high. Brush your teeth. No one likes to eat right after cleaning their mouth. Plus you probably have bong-breath anyway, and no one likes to smell that, lol Eat things that don't fill you up and aren't bad for you. This one I actually do follow sometimes. I like to eat fruit when I'm stoned because not only is it delicious and refreshing, but fruit is also not very filling and it's much healthier than junk food, so I end up not getting heartburn and such the next day because I can more or less eat all I want with no negative consequences. Use a ""filler"". A lot of people in this thread are saying water, which is a good idea. Ingest a ""filler"", or something that has little to no nutritional value, but will still give you a feeling of fullness. Water Chocolate milk probably is the best option because it can satisfy, it gets rid of cotton-mouth, and it keeps you hydrated, which is really important in all aspects of life, but especially if you are stoned. I remembered at work today that I drink chocolate milk as my filler, and I thought ""Oh crap, I put the wrong information on that dudes post"". Seriously, though, chocolate milk works wayyyy better as a filler. Suck on a hard candy or chew some gum. Not only delicious, but hard candies and gum can help satisfy food cravings by tricking your body with the chewing/sucking motions.   I hope these help. Lord knows I certainly should start using these methods, lol"

Also, a word of advice. Do not get in to a habit of eating while high and only when you're high.

It's similar to being on a diet, not just controlling what you eat but when you eat.   Stay away from junk. Try to have fruits and vegetables on deck. Grapes and berries are nature's candy. You can gobble em up and be healthy. Have some food prepped before you get the munchies. That way, you don't go chasing unhealthy eats.  Anything after 8pm, especially before you sleep, is a negative.  Usually, thats the case with weed.   Basically, you need will power. After a while, you get used to it. Your resistance becomes stronger than the crave.   For me, it used to be bad. I'm in NYC. Everything is open 24hrs. I would binge so hard on snacks and drinks. I started by replacing foods with fruits. I went to the supermarket instead of the drivethru. But, just fruits weren't good. So, I controlled my timing when I ate. I'd eat less in the day knowing I'd get high and have to appease the munchie gods at night. After a while, I started prepping my meals beforehand. That's when I relaized I was eating too late and usually before sleep. That doesnt help. I just stopped. Hard as hell. But, it becomes like an addiction. You gotta learn to control it. Now, I get high at nights and don't even think about food. The weird thing is, I rarely have an apetite which is the problem I have now. I'm eating because I know I have to eat. I dont have hunger for anything. I went whole days without eating. That gave me headaches. Now, I eat on schedule b/c I have to. But, I don't get the munchies anymore. Better off this way. I can maintain a healthier eating pattern when I'm eating to live not living to eat."

saplings,3c5pd8,p984321,2,Sun Jul 5 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as marijuana ages, there's really not a whole lot you can do to prevent it from drying out. A mason jar will keep it fresh and smokeable, but that doesn't necessarily prevent it from drying. I always keep my stash out of the light, in a neutral temperature, and away from all airflow and it still gets drier eventually.  Also, plastic bags/Ziploc bags aren't good for jack squat, period, just so you know. They don't reduce smell, they don't really keep the airflow out, they eventually break down/rip, they don't protect your goodies from being crushed, they don't keep the light out, and they don't protect from any temperature either. A good mason jar (""Bell"" brand has been around for a century for a reason [my girlfriend got me a 6-pack of the ""Vintage"" style Bell jars for Christmas, and I'm about to use one for my accumulating duff]) is really all you need. Bell jars are cheap and can be bought at just about any supermarket I can think of. Check the ""Canning"" section."

Just use it like you would normally butter, eat half of the amount you normally would and wait an hour before consuming more.

Also keep in mind that your tolerance is way lower than a regular smoker so a giant rip is going to affect you differently than it does your stoner friends.  My first few highs weren't very enjoyable, but recently I've been starting to ""get it."" Just last night I smoked a bowl and had my best high yet. Just start slow and smoke a little at a time. Also, I'm the kind of person who wants to be logically in control of things all the time, so I had to learn to relax and stop trying to control the high. Just let it take you places and don't try to fight it. One thing that helps me is to focus on something I enjoy, like playing video games, listening to my favorite music, or skype calling my friends.

As for care/maintenance, it all depends on how cleanly you care (or don't care) to be. I'm regards to leftover resin, most people tend to leave small bits in the piece after they ash it, as the leftover resin doesn't effect your smoking much. However when it does build up enough and get dirtier, people usually clean it with a isopropyl alcohol and salt solution, which you can find at most walmarts or drug stores.  Aside from that, a quick and easy way to clean small spots is just swab it down with a q-tip and some isopropyl :]"

And make sure you have the correct amount of money they want, don't expect change or anything. It's worth asking what they charge beforehand. It may seem novice, but it's a good question since prices can vary person to person and they may give you a deal for the first buy from them. Bring a backup zip lock in case they don't have a baggie, this actually happened to me multiple times with my last dealer. Don't talk much, stick to the business. You could lead of with a 'hey, so $(whatever price)? And then they can confirm and you fork it over. They hand you bud, you say thanks man. Then scoot.

Eh, I wouldn't try and use lingo. If overused it may be kinda annoying. Just ask if you can have their dealer's number. Plug always sounded dumb to me but I guess it doesn't matter haha. And when you get the dealers number, say I'm a friend of ""___"" (first name only), looking to pickup an eighth. What do you charge and do you offer a first buy discount? Something like that.

If you want to smoke, I suggest reviewing how you smoke. Do you smoke blunts/joints? Maybe try different wraps, or try mixing in a bit of tobacco to change the flavor (consider the risks of tobacco before making your decision). Do you smoke a pipe? Maybe try a bong, it'll get you just as high but the smoke will be less harsh. Maybe your smoking tool is dirty; cleaning it could make your weed taste better.   Also, if you use a bong/pipe, consider what you're smoking with. If you're using a zippo, you'll taste the butane. I suggest sticking to gas station lighters and such.  You could also try different strains of weed; they all taste differently. Weed of the same strain can also differ in flavor, depending on how dry/seedy the weed is.  It could also take time to develop a taste for the smoke, same as people develop tastes for alcohol/tobacco.   Maybe you just don't like the taste of weed, and that's okay, too. Hope this helped."

saplings,3bztd1,Star_DryBones,2,Fri Jul 3 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"It depends who your grandmother associated with during her high school and college years. Marijuana wasn't universally hated at any point in time, though during the 40's and 50's there was a shitton of propaganda and poor research against it.  My best guess is that during her time in high school the majority opinion would be that smoking pot was bad, and most people probably did not smoke weed (the 60's was when the marijuana scene really took off), though it was more common in the African-American community of the time.  As early as the 40's medical authorities were discovering and announcing that marijuana was not as dangerous as popularly thought, however the general attitude toward it did not really change until the 80's. It became very common in the 60's and 70's, however it was more of a counter-culture thing that was looked down on by many mainstream people. By the 1980's the majority medical opinion had changed to believing marijuana to not really be a serious health threat, but that it only caused behavioral problems. And so by this time it was much more common for ""regular people"" to try smoking weed, and by the 90's it had become a mainstream drug, extremely common throughout high schools and workplaces in America. By the 2000's public opinion towards marijuana shifted very positively, with the common belief that it made people permanently stupid being mostly dispelled. Then here we are in 2015, with a sweep of legalization occurring throughout America in the last 5 years, with a general movement towards federal decriminalization possibly following the next election (as marijuana's criminal status is one of the hot-button issues of this coming election).  The bottom line is that it's probably going to be tough to convert her or your parents fully, and the more you push, the less likely they'll be to change their minds (they'll see it as you obsessing about the drug). Simply continue to be healthy in your use of it (making sure it's not interfering with your obligations such as work and/or schooling, making sure you're not obsessing about it, making sure it's not altering your behavior or personality negatively, etc). Over time they'll stop worrying, and maybe one day might be interested in trying (I wouldn't bother offering until you're an adult and have moved out, simply because they're going to think of you partially as a child until you've become independent)."

saplings,3bysqo,GetOutOfBox,2,Fri Jul 3 09:09:58 2015 UTC,"They are not allowed to test your blood for anything without your informed consent. This is a fundamental medical and legal principle. The only time your informed consent is not required, is when you're being forced by a warrant, or where law permits a police officer to test you.  So in other words, neither your doctor nor insurance provider can have a drug test administered without your knowledge.  Now if you want to be cautious, you can ask for a list of the blood tests they'd like to do beforehand. If there's no drug test listed (i.e ""Marijuana/Illicit Drug metabolites"", etc), they can't test you.  Now, even if they were to test you without your knowledge, you can always request a copy of your file from your insurance provider a few weeks after your surgery (to give them time to aquire and centralize documentation related to the surgery), and if you see a positive drug test, speak with your rep and demand it be struck from your file, or that a re-test be done (say it was a false positive).  Either way, I've never heard of random insurance-requested drug tests, generally the only ones that frequently would request something like that at all are life insurance providers when you sign up."

saplings,3bzk8a,tester1000,2,Fri Jul 3 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"Vaporizing really is the best way to smoke weed. There are no drawbacks (some people say they feel ""less fucked up"", but I've always preferred clear highs; just because you aren't couchlocked doesn't mean it's not relaxing you and relieving stress), and it's far less dangerous to your health. Remember that when burning marijuana, you're producing many of the same carcinogenic byproducts produced when you burn tobacco, so there are similar risks. There is really no situation in which it's not bad for your health to inhale smoke, and while marijuana can overcome the damage caused by inhaling smoke to a certain degree, it's cancer-preventing properties are not sufficient to fully offset the risk. Additionally, why not fully benefit from marijuana by not wasting part of it's benefit countering the damage caused by smoking?  Vaporizing also generally requires less weed. When marijuana is burned, as much as 50% of the cannabinoids are destroyed by the extremely high heat (3000F+ from a regular lighter, whereas temps in the 375-500 range are all that's necessary to extract cannabinoids from the flowers). However you may find that you use about the same, as some people gauge how high they are based on how fucked up they feel, which is generally less with vaporization. So if you're careful (try small amounts to start, and slowly work your way until you're at the level you like), you can conserve weed, but if you rush it you'll probably use about the same amount.  Another major plus for vaporizers, is that you can keep the vaped leftovers (tap them out into a sealable container) and eventually extract whatever THC is left in them into an oil or edibles like brownies. Of course vaped weed is not going to be anywhere near as strong as fresh weed in edible form, but it can be great to augment your high, or for it's medicinal properties. If you're lazy you could simply soak the vaped weed in boiling hot milk (bring it to a boil, then add the weed after it's in the mug) for 20 minutes or so and drink that. The milk (or some other fatty substance) is necessary as cannabinoids to not extract well into water."

After rinsing, fill up your piece with the highest % isopropyl alcohol that you can find, and salt to act as an abrasive. Normally you'd shake it good and drain, but in your case I would leave it to let it sit for a couple hours, if not overnight. Prior to draining, shake it up really good (but make sure the holes are plugged!) and then drain. Give another thorough rinsing with hot water, and you should be good. If there are any pieces of grime left, soak a Qtip in the alcohol and do your best to scrape, if it can reach."

I basically left it on and took hits once in a while.  What happened was that I coughed a lot in the first several hits, but once I was already high, it felt like my body could handle it without coughing anymore."
saplings,3bvuc4,HarleyQuinnLove,23,Thu Jul 2 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Pipes are really easy for beginners since all you have to do is drop your fresh ground in and go. Plus, pipes are infinitely reusable. You don't need a grinder, it just makes it easier. When I first started out, I really didn't have a problem using my hands to grind my weed. If you don't have long enough fingernails, you can take 2 shot glasses, drop your weed into the bottom of one, and then crush it with the bottom of the other glass. Or, you can drop weed into the bottom of one and then use scissors to chop it all up. You'll probably get the best results out of using your bare hands though. Most bud nowadays doesn't really have seeds in it, at least in my experience. The last time I had seeds was when I purchased an eighth over 4 buys ago. Either way, if you do, just pick them out (don't grind them up) and save them for later. You can try growing your own plants or possibly sell them to someone else. Get an eye-drop that specifically says it targets redness, and put them in before you start to smoke, or just as you start smoking. Putting them in later won't do anything. But, you just might be the kind of person who never looks high. I'm one of those people naturally. I don't know why, but my eyes almost never get red, and, if they do, it's hardly noticeable unless you stare at me. The only times I've had red eyes was when I hit a huge joint multiple times, and when I ate half of a really good edible.   Now to the good stuff:   When you start, take only a single hit and then wait for at least 10 minutes. Beginners often smoke too much, which sucks and wastes weed. If after 10 minutes you feel good, set the pipe down. If you feel like you wanna go a little more, go ahead and take another hit. If you are unsure in your capacities, always wait at least 10 minutes between each hit. It takes about 10 minutes for your body to extract as much THC as possible out of each hit. Wear clothing that feels comfortable to you no matter what position you are sitting or lying down in. Pour a glass of juice or cold water out for yourself before you start smoking, and set it down where you will be chilling the most. That first drink you have when you're stoned? Whew, forget about it. ""Refreshing"" is an understatement. Cotton mouth will happen, but you can easily beat it if you have a drink handy. Set up the lights and temperature of your place before you start. I like to keep my place dark and cool so I don't hurt my eyes with light and because wrapping up in a blanket while high is very comfortable.   If you have any specific questions, please feel free to message me. I love talking about this kind of stuff and I know a lot about it, and I'm certainly willing to help :)"

saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,5,Thu Jul 2 21:00:06 2015 UTC,This si the best advice I've gotten. So many details thanks!
saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,8,Thu Jul 2 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"OH, before I forget, you need to know how to inhale properly. A lot of beginners don't inhale the right way, and it becomes frustrating because they aren't getting high. Here's how I liked to take hits when I started out:   Engage lighter. Lightly combust a tiny portion of the weed, as far over on the side of the bowl as possible. Don't douse the entire bowl in flame, or you'll waste it. All you need to do is light a tiny corner, because dragging on the pipe will allow the embers to spread. Only torch the whole bowl at the very end when it's starting to ash. If your piece doesn't have a carburetor/choke/carb/shotgun/tiny-little-hole-in-the-side-to-affect-airflow, just inhale normally through it. If your piece does have a carb, cover it with your finger when you inhale through your piece. This restricts airflow and allows the cherry (the lit, ember portion of the weed in the bowl) to get bigger and hotter. As you approach the end of your hit, release the carb and lightly inhale through it to ""clear the chamber"", as it were. Take your hit by slowly breathing inward. Once you feel your lungs are about halfway full, stop taking your hit. Take the piece out of your mouth and continue inhaling only fresh air until you feel that your lungs are full to capacity. Hold for a couple seconds (no more than 5. Any longer is unnecessary, and will only make you light-headed). Exhale slowly.   There are other breathing techniques, but this one is more or less the surefire way to ensure that you actually inhaled the hit."
saplings,3bvuc4,siggie_balls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I would say not to inhale halfway with smoke, at that point youre gonna cough up a lung"
saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,2,Thu Jul 2 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I frequently fill my lungs most of the way with smoke before I finish off with fresh air, and I don't have a problem with coughing.  Really the only times I've had problems with coughing is when I take too many hits in too short of a time."
saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,2,Sat Jul 4 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I have more if you need it!"
saplings,3bvuc4,Skizzius,0,Thu Jul 2 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the ""one hit and wait"" method. You're not gonna get high off of one hit. Make sure you know how to inhale, it's just like sucking liquid from a straw. If you have a bowl, pack a bowl, smoke it all between you two, see how you feel in a few minutes, then pack another. make sure you both have a bottle of water, I would take a sip after every hit, make sure the water is cold to sooth your throat."
saplings,3bvuc4,canada171,3,Thu Jul 2 20:19:58 2015 UTC,Depending on how big a hit is and how good the pot is they can get comfortably high with one hit.
saplings,3bvuc4,cartruck42,3,Thu Jul 2 20:54:58 2015 UTC,Most people starting out WILL get pretty high off one hit unless the weed is total shit. I took 3 my 1st time and was too fucked to operate a microwave. Remember low tolerance and decent weed quality exist.
saplings,3bvuc4,mike559,2,Thu Jul 2 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"Make sure you know how to inhale, it's just like sucking liquid from a straw.   Sucking from a straw and inhaling are two different things. Sucking is making a mini vacuum in your mouth using your cheeks and lips, but inhaling is creating a vacuum in your lungs using your diaphragm. I guess you can suck if you're hitting a joint or blunt, but then you'd have to inhale afterwards, so it's still not the same."
saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,2,Thu Jul 2 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"You can easily get high off of a single hit. I smoke once per week, and have been for months, and I can still get stoned off of one hit.   Also, it's definitely not like sucking liquid from a straw, because that form of suction only involves your mouth. Smoking requires suction involving the use of the lungs and diaphragm."

saplings,3bvuc4,perksbeingwallflower,2,Thu Jul 2 21:39:09 2015 UTC,Another noob here. How many hits do you usually get out of a bowl? Do you have to re-light it for every hit?
saplings,3bvuc4,Afrew,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"It very much depends on the size of the bowl, but if the bowl on my pipe is filled completely I'll usually get at least 20 hits out of it.   You do not have to relight the bowl after every hit as long as you take another hit before the embers go out. Even if there is the tiniest glow in your bowl, you can more than probably still flare it back up by covering the carb (the tiny little hole on the side) and inhaling slowly."

saplings,3bvuc4,doggxyo,8,Sat Jul 4 01:54:26 2015 UTC,"my first time was out of a glass bowl or pipe. in my opinion id say the pipe would be easier as you won't need to roll the joint..  grinders are nice - but not absolutely necessary. if you don't have one you can break it up by hand (but don't smoke the stems!)  most of the time, the bud i buy doesn't have seeds in it - however if you come across one as you break it up then just remove it and toss it.  the best kind of eye drops i've used are Rohtos. they work really well and give you a nice surprising cooling sensation on your eyes which i can only describe as amazing when you're ripped.  best of luck!"
saplings,3bvuc4,timeisnothing13,3,Thu Jul 2 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Making a pipe out of a fruit is pretty common you should look into it. Or find a guide how to roll a joint.

saplings,3bvuc4,Plut012345,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend starting out small and waiting a little after each hit, just so you don't get too high the first time, since your tolerance is low being it your guys first time."
saplings,3bvuc4,ralberic,5,Thu Jul 2 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's also why I'd recommend a bowl over a joint.  It's easier to go one hit at a time and not feel like you're wasting any."
saplings,3bvuc4,AceOfReQuiem,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"To add to other posts:  Make sure you have your foods ready like premade sandwiches or oven baked snacks or something similar, fruit perhaps and DEFINATELY potato chips :P  Same with drinks, fruit drinks are the bomb. Apple juice in particular does well for people and especially for me. Alcohol and weed dont always mix well. I would suggest staying off the booze.  Have some movies ready to watch (like the new mad max) and have some chill music at hand.  Have some really sugary stuff ready if someone goes too high, it helps comming down. You cant die or sustain any injury or permanent damage from weed but you can possibly feel quite bad. Its a small chance but the chance is there, better take precaution imho, as it is the first time. If you do feel bad, do something like playing videogames or play catch with a random (soft) object. It helps taking your mind off the paranoia n stuff.  Ask anything, no question is stupid or dumb ;)  Also, most important thing: Have fun :D"
saplings,3bvuc4,Skizzius,2,Thu Jul 2 19:15:04 2015 UTC,"If it is your first time don't spend a lot of money on it. Don't buy a grinder because say you don't like smoking, and you never use the grinder again. Same with a bowl, you shouldn't spend a lot of money on it. But... you're probably not gonna know how to roll, so I would recommend a $10-$20 bowl from a local headshop or DHgate. 95/100 there aren't any seeds in it, and if there are, when you grind it up with your fingers you will find them. Don't worry about brand of eye drop, just go to the drug store and buy the cheapest ""red eye relief""."
saplings,3bvuc4,179jfkla,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest a pipe personally, I find that I never really get good hits off a joint. A grinder can be handy, or you can just crumble it a bit with your fingers. Last time I smoked with a girl I just tore up a gram and packed it in an apple pipe, we smoked pretty much all of it and she started feeling too high. So a bit of advice on what to do if you start feeling uncomfortable.  *You will be fine, smoking a gram can't hurt you *If you feel like your consciousness and body separate (basically like you're a ghost floating above your body and not quite in control of your body) then start talking and focus on what you're doing. Alternatively you can just embrace the feeling and go with it, however it can be pretty unsettling the first time it happens (note: I tend to not get this feeling frequently, but the girl I smoked with last time said she was feeling it) *If you start getting paranoid I find that just repeating my thought process out loud helps *Listen to some music with positive vibes your first time, especially something you already enjoy. I've heard people say ""if you get lost just follow the music"" when you do psychedelics, it applies more to shrooms or LSD but it can also be relevant if you get pretty stoned like I did when I smoked a gram my first time. *If you start feeling trapped going outside can help, especially if it's night. A cool breeze such as a fan is nice as well"

No real size comparison but looks good. Also id suggest buying that pipe for $20, looks worth it. Edit: You're lucky if that stuff is a sativa dominant strain since they're somewhat rare in most places, expect a good mental high. Incase no one has said it, don't smoke stems. Stems are almost worthless so u can throw that part away."

saplings,3bufuq,cartruck42,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"You were likely buzzed. With sativa strains (assuming it was) they dont tend to ""knock you out"" like indicas as much. Its a fun, trippy feeling, you should be for sure thinking differently than normal. Keep experimenting, about how much did u smoke? If u get really high you'll definitely know. A proper inhale is basically just breathing smoke and chasing with air, hold for about 3-4 seconds, exhale. You can take small hits (less smoke, more air) if you find it hard to handle at first. Enough weed can even be like a lowish dose of a strong psychedelic depending on the strain sometimes. Edit: One more thing, some people don't realize you need to light the bowl and inhale at the same time to get the bowl lit. It sucks the flame in, unlike a joint where you light it, then start smoking. With more experience you'll get the hang of it all pretty quick. Sorry if I'm over-educating you."

saplings,3bsxzv,tomcruisesdishwasher,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:06:31 2015 UTC,"I love masturbating when I'm stoned, and I really don't have a problem with ""performance"" at all either. How often are you smoking? I smoke once per week, normally by myself, but sometimes with friends. If you are smoking multiple times per week and, therefore, are masturbating while stoned multiple times per week, you may be messing up your brain.  Y'see, whether people want to believe it or not, heavy marijuana usage is habit forming. This is especially true for when you do the same thing only when you're stoned. If you play basketball really well, and then start to only play basketball when you're stoned, you'll eventually reach a point to where sober you has lost a lot of skill, but high you is on point. It's the same with your ""performance"", I reckon. If you only do sexual things while stoned, eventually it'll get to a point where you really only can do sexual things while stoned, at least until you wait long enough for your body and brain to reset themselves.  Next time you hit the dope, just distract yourself with something other than masturbating. Set up a couple mental blocks beforehand saying ""We're trying to fix this, so let's focus on something else."" Works for me whenever I'm stoned."

Cops looking to bust guys for small purchases usually use the shotgun approach, putting on some temp cover (dressing up, hitting up a club) and just asking random people if they can buy weed.  In all likelihood this is just a regular, non-cop chick. If she is a cop, unless you know anyone selling or are intending to make large purchases (greater than a quarter oz per sale), she's probably not looking to bust you, but rather wants to find other dealers. So for the best safety, just make sure you make every interaction with her indicate you're a small fish (buy small amounts, don't talk about dealers you know, act like you don't know much about weed or drug dealing, etc)."

saplings,3bpp92,ted_muffin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"Did you use a bong? If not, you probably simply weren't fully inhaling (but rather drawing it into your throat and upper bronchial tubes; keep in mind you have quite a length of tubing between your mouth and lungs; the tube descends down and connects at your lungs mid-point, so about halfway down your chest). I suggest you either try a bong (which forces a full inhalation as you must draw from your diaphragm to create enough pressure), or draw small hits followed by deep inhalations of fresh air to force the smoke all the way into your lungs.  If you used a bong, make sure you held your breath in for at least a couple of seconds; while it's not usually necessary to hold in your breath for long periods, if you're coughing as soon as the smoke hits your lungs you may only be getting a small percentage of the available THC. Holding for 3 seconds should be enough.  Finally if you've tried all of this but nothing worked, try 20 minutes of moderate cardio exercise (a moderate jog, bicycling, etc) right before smoking. THC is rather unusual in that it doesn't actually activate cannabinoid receptors in the brain by itself; it simply enhances the response of said receptors to your brain's internal cannabinoids. Since exercise increases the release of those cannabinoids, you will find it will enhance your high. You may find that you particularly enjoy exercising while high for this reason."

saplings,3bpp92,attacksully,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, you want to try to hold the smoke in your lungs for at least four seconds. If you let it out right away, your lungs won't have a chance to absorb the active compounds in what you smoke."
saplings,3bpp92,gameofthroffice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"I never take my finger off the carb until after I take the first hit. Take all the smoke in your mouth, pull the pipe away, take a deep breath DONT EXHALE OH NO YOU'LL RUIN THIS and then, after your breath of fresh air, exhale using your mouth and nose. I have heard that exhaling through your nose allows you to absorb a lil more thc but that could be bull shit. Then take your finger off the carb and clear the bowl )doing the same inhale+air method( boom"
saplings,3bpp92,BongWeedsly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:13:59 2015 UTC,Make sure you're breathing it in line you're yawning. When you come up from the pipe/ whatever device take a deep breath of air into your lungs with the same motion as when you yawn. That's how I got down the breathing.

The only time I can see coating your joints with anything and still having it work is if you make a ""twax joint"", which is when you take a BHO concentrate in the form of a ""shatter"" and mold it into a longish piece. Wrap that piece in a corkscrew pattern starting from the end of the joint to your mouth. Once you light it, it should burn relatively normally."

It looks exactly like the bee-juice and it's kind of hard to work with in joints.   The blunt rolls are thick so you can get away with clumps of honey oil. ( honey oil is what it's called around here) With the joints, what we do is heat the honey until it's thin and then dip a nail into the honey and then let little long strings of it go up and down the length of the unrolled joint, that's only half filled with weed. Then put the rest of the weed on top. Try not to let the honey oil touch the rolling paper, and roll it up.   The honey oil is super concentrate thc and it makes the joint burn slow with massive foggy clouds. You can get a group high on one little j."

saplings,3bqtne,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"In my experience the honey trick doesn't really work. If you completely coat the joint all the way around, the paper will burn too slowly and the joint will probably keep fizzling out if left for more than 5 seconds or so. If you only put a line along the joint, the paper will burn at different speeds and the joint will end up falling apart.  When it comes down to it, joints aren't really meant to last long periods. I've always thought of joints being a social thing; if it's just for me why not just smoke from a piece where I can only use as much weed as I need? When smoking a joint in a group, the whole idea is to keep it constantly going around the circle, so while it's finished relatively quickly most of the smoke is enjoyed (and also what kind of group of stoners only has a single joint?).  If you'd really like a longer experience just smoke blunts with nice thick paper instead, and maybe sprinkle a tiny pinch of tobacco in as it burns slower."

saplings,3bp19a,BrainOfSweden,2,Thu Jul 2 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"I'm still a pretty inexperienced smoker, but here's my take:  Listening to music feels like the most amazing brain massage, and your eyes start filling in the parts of the music that's too big for your ears with afterimages and sparkly patterns.  Then your muscles start twitching, but it's not unpleasant because you can better feel the texture of whatever fabric your skin's rubbing up against. All textures feel wonderful. You don't quite have control over your body anymore because all your senses are in overdrive, and most of your brain is busy just processing every detail of what's around you, and all you can say is whoa with a huge, stupid grin on your face.  I get cotton mouth pretty bad when I smoke, so I drink a lot of water/eat lots of fruit. This means I have to pee a lot. The first time I got to a [10], I had to keep smacking myself in the face while peeing because I wasn't 100% sure I was actually in the bathroom, peeing into the toilet, as opposed to peeing the bed (where I was smoking). Like, I had to keep bringing myself back to the present because my mind kept wandering.

saplings,3bp19a,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:42:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is my view:   I consider anywhere from [1] - [10] to be when you are high, but are still able to string coherent thoughts together. In a way, you are still conscious. You are at least aware of what's going on, even if you can't really react to it.  Any numbers after that (I wouldn't consider anything past [15] to really be legitimate, and you're basically just going into ""joke"" territory at that point), starting from [11], obviously, are when you are so high that you can't really think clearly anymore; you start to confuse even yourself. Vaporizing is possible to get you there, but with edibles it's really easy. I made a Firecracker one time, ate half of it, and a bit over an hour later was easily sitting at a [13]. My senses seemed hyperactive and also dulled at the same time. It's great if you know how to cope with it, but sometimes it really just throws you off and it's like trying to climb a greased up rope, except at the top is yourself.   Anywho, the one time I was explicitly at a [10], all I could do was lie on my couch because I couldn't stop seeing galaxies and starbursts and comet trails and such.

I didn't throw up from the weed, I had actually smoked too much hookah too fast that day, and I don't smoke normally, so I just had too much nicotine.  The cool thing was that even though I was stoned out of my mind, my body still had that distinct feeling you get when you are about to hurl. It felt as if a big clenching was going through my whole body and converging in my face."
saplings,3bmmrq,Afrew,2,Wed Jul 1 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I have a low tolerance so half a spliff gets me pretty stoned. I didnt realise I was smoking this kief filled spliff on my own, so it was a combination of too much nicotine and weed. It was fine after I threw up but the next few times I smoked I was always anxious about any sensation in my throat or stomach which was shit. Havent smoked in about 5 weeks and wont again until around september so hopefully I wont get that feeling again."

You can handle it."" I've had a few bad highs, and they really suck, and I have had fleeting thoughts of ""What if that happens again?"" as I've brought my pipe up to my mouth, but then I'll take a deep breath, and strive to make it a better high. Something I learned a long time ago that has given me a lot of help in my smoking career: Take a breath, and make a damn plan. Say it just like that and you'll be fine.  But yeah, kief will definitely knock you around some, lol. The night before I started a t-break one time, I packed my bowl with what I thought was just some very fluffy ground from my grinder, when really it was mostly kief! Had a really powerful high that night, and the bowl sustained many more hits than I thought it would, even though it was tiny. The most amazing part of the night was when I stood at the edge of my balcony on my apartment with bats flying super close all around me."

It felt cool, honestly, but I felt that it wouldn't be okay to stay like that for long, so I stopped what I was doing, sat back, and took a few deep breaths while concentrating on everything around me. It seemed to help a lot, and it didn't detract from my high at all either.  I've always wanted to go for a walk while stoned, but I'm apprehensive about it.

At a 10, you're either hallucinating a bit (been there) or so damn couchlocked that you don't/won't/can't move (been there).   Everyone's specific experience will be different but what I mentioned is how you really know what's up.  For me, my hallucinations started with extreme sensitivity to light and sounds. I had to shut things off. It was just too much going on. Eventually, in a room of darkness and quiet, shit started happening. One time, pink bunnies. Another, I swear my brain was being massages by god. Another time, I woke up. I didnt know I went to sleep. I just woke up. I knew I had slept or napped but I didnt know I actually slept.   My friend, those are true 10s.   For you, you're probably at a 6 or 7. You can still communicate and describe your experience.   FYI, your tolerance is still low. TAKE ADVANTAGE. Get high then get higher and higher! Be in a comfortable place. Lay down and relax. Ride the high. Takes a shitload for me to get to that 10 now. My tolerance is too high.. woe is me."

I couldn't even keep a thought in my head, and that was frustrating. I remember desperately wishing I could hang onto one single thought, but everything was racing and nothing made sense. I had a small CD player by my bed, but didn't have it together enough to change the CD, so I wound up listening to the same Louis CK CD six or 8 times over. I now hate that CD.  Even then, I never hallucinated. I know it can happen; I've had friends tell me of their experiences. But I didn't. So even on that Saturday I wouldn't say I was at a 10. I've never been at a 10, and don't fucking want to!"

Thats why you couldnt move. Indicas arent as fun on a 10. Sativas are fun but only if you relax and let your mind go. If you try to maintain control, try to be active, youre gonna have a bad time. Next time at dispensary, ask for Sativa or find out what youre getting. But yeah, you experienced an Indica 10."

If you are OK with the quality going down, but you want a mellow body high, Pop that shit in the oven at 300 degrees for 5 minutes. Wrap tightly ( in 2 layers) with foil. Remove from oven, enjoy smoking.   It wont taste as good because you are losing a few volatile terpines but whatever, what you're doing is removing terps and THC, which is what's causing you anxiety. If you drink some lavender tea the Linalool will calm you down as well, because of the entourage effect with the other cannabinoids.   TL;DR - get some lavender, or lavender extract and make some tea. Drink 30 mins prior to toking/eating/vaping/whatever the fuck you do to ingest cannabis, and decarb your bud.

saplings,3bmau5,GetOutOfBox,5,Tue Jun 30 11:02:04 2015 UTC,"As a rule I only ever draw until my lungs are about half full, and then I fill the rest with fresh air. This helps to immidiately reduce the temperature of the smoke (which prevents heat-irritation), and dilutes it so they're not getting a huge shock of irritating compounds produced by combustion (diluting the smoke won't affect absorption). I do this even if there's still more in the bong; I'll just cover it with my hand and finish it on a second inhale.  The next step I usually do is to slowly exhale the smoke, then I pause for a second, then slowly inhale fresh air through my nose. Inhaling fresh air through your nose humidifies it (from the mucous in your nasal passageways), which can help reverse the drying of your lungs caused by the hot smoke. I repeat this process (exhale slowly, wait, inhale slowly) about 3 times before taking another hit or talking.  Make sure to drink some water right after a hit, as it will help cool your throat down (try to ""throw it"" down your throat so it rinses all sides of it). If the hit was very rough, try drinking some milk, as it can help wash away any residue left from the smoke.  Doing this technique, I usually don't even cough once, and this is coming from a guy who had asthma as a kid and has smoked during colds."

saplings,3bn77t,burningtrees1178,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"Not really any worse for you than any other method of getting high, I reckon. Concentrates are just really condensed forms of THC created by washing buds with a chemical catalyst like CO2 or butane. If the concentrate is made poorly, you may ingest more of the catalyst than you would with a well-made concentrate. Ergo, you may inhale more chemicals than if you would just smoke weed.   However, considering you only need to smoke a ""dab"" of a concentrate to get incredibly strong effects, I feel that it evens out: it's not really ""bad"" when you only smoke a dab the size of a pea. It's not as if you are smoking an actual bowl's worth of a concentrate. [2]"
saplings,3bn77t,Afrew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"If its a well made concentrate then it should have very little excess butane or whatever was used to make it, which you can normally tell just by looking at it. The darker the color the less pure, thats why all of the shatter you see on here or instagram or wherever is a light yellow if not almost transparent. No matter what, inhaling any type of smoke into your lungs is not healthy. Granted, concentrates are normally vaporized which is a healthier alternative to smoking, but if you're vaporizing the chemicals used to make the concentrates because they werent purged well enough, it obviously isn't good. But nobody has died from dabs yet so I think you're in the clear if thats what you're worried about"

To judge that, you have to feel the consistency and see how many air bubbles are left behind in it. Color has to do with the quality of the THC content, yes, but it can also indicate how long the buds may have been soaking and how long it has been exposed to the air before purging, both of which really don't affect the quality very much at all."

She also is interjecting way too much of her personal opinion, but playing it off as if it automatically refutes or confirms whatever others are claiming or disagreeing with. ""Other extract artists insisted that open blasting can be done safely indoors. All of the professional chemists that BuzzFeed News spoke with disagreed with that claim."" There should definitely be sources for this sort of claim, and even more so for this sort of disagreement with that claim.  There is a ton of bullshit fluff-n-flair in this article, and it's clear that the author is uninformed in this area. ""Many BHO consumers also believe that terpenes and terpenoids serve a medicinal purpose. (There is no scientific evidence one way or the other.)"" Wtf is the point of putting that in the article, other than to try to show people that you know what you are talking about when you clearly don't know?   Also, they talk about how ""there's more butane in the concentrates than people realize"", but does that really matter when you look at how small of an amount you have to use to get a very strong effect? I can safely bet that you get more pollution in your lungs by simply standing next to a running car.  Also also, this ""Matt Rize"" sounds like an asshole, and a con-man. He openly bashes literally every other person's perspective and views, yet regards his own as ""correct"" and that he is doing everything right.

saplings,3bn1v2,Afrew,3,Tue Jun 30 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"http://www.ebay.com/itm/400736866910  Dude, get this grinder. It's only $10 with free shipping, it's high-grade aluminum, and it has 4 chambers, not to mention it comes with a little kief-spatula. I bought mine in purple a long while ago, and it's great. It grinds really finely if you grind upside-down, it's really durable, and it's big enough to store a good amount in it while still being small enough to be easily portable. I got my friend one in green for his birthday, and he uses his all the time too. Unfortunately, it appears that this seller doesn't supply any colors other than the ""silver"" anymore, but, personally, I think the silver is really cool looking, very sleek.  You should really spring for a metal grinder anyway. Plastic runs the risk of cracking, and the teeth would probably eventually grind away or break off. These problems really aren't possible with a metal grinder. [2]"

Drugs have a fascinating way amplifying your emotions, and on rare occasions sometimes you aren't even aware of the emotions it's amplifying. I tend to not smoke when I'm feeling sad or something extremely negative happens in my day. It's normal to experience what you experienced, yet rare if your in a good mood."

It's a daydream. I get it if I have work the next day sometimes, or something I forgot to do because I got high, just enjoy the moment, go outside and be active, enforce the dopamine, replace it if you're detoxing with even more outdoors.

Once, I smoked with someone who broke my heart (Long story as to why, not going to get into it), and I ended up feeling really insecure and crying for a good half an hour on top of them. Not a good time.  The long and the short of it is this, you'll have good and bad experiences and it's hard to really say why sometimes. Just embrace the next good one twice as hard to make up for it."
saplings,3bitcn,StJupiter,2,Mon Jun 29 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"This has happened to me several times. Like another user mentioned, it has a tendency to throw you emotions back at you, so it's best to avoid smoking when you're sad or depressed. But on another note, getting high sets off your serotonin (feels-good receptors) levels and can cause you to feel a deep low after the good vibes wear off. This is especially common and well known with MDMA users as the intense pleasure of the effects nearly deplete your serotonin completely (it takes about a week to feel normal after use and about three months to return to a normal chemical balance in the brain).   Hope this helps."

If you have some issues going on that are prone for depression, then MJ might bring you down. If people are not exploring their sober world and dealing with their cognitive dissonance and instead just self-medicating these kinds of things can happen.  Also, certain strains can be lifting or sedating. Check out leafly.com for that kind of info."

It's a combination of being more experienced, not making it such a  big deal, and having a tolerance. Here are things that tend to give me this anxiety like feeling.  Being in a situation where you may get caught smoking weed (be it cops, parents, and lets hope not but maybe, teachers). Being with people you: don't know very well, just met, or are not on good terms with or sketch out by. Being in a sad, angry, scared, or other negatively geared mood. Doing something you (or someone else): have never done before, have never done stoned, need to concentrate for, think is dangerous. Mixing other drugs. Forgetting to do something."
saplings,3bitcn,Afrew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"It happens to me sometimes. It's actually happening right now, or at least was earlier this morning, lol. I smoked a lot last night, and then was just feeling kind of down when I woke up this morning.   A lot of people are saying that this is because of the mindset you have while getting high, but, honestly, it's more than probably much simpler than that. What happens when you get high is that your brain gets flooded by chemicals that are very similar to certain ""neurotransmitters"" (chemicals created by your brain to dictate feelings and body processes), specifically dopamine, which contributes to happiness. The ""high"" is created by your brain being flooded with these chemicals, when normally the brain only creates enough on its own to function normally, so the brain stops producing the normal amount on its own as well. After you come down from your high, you may feel fuzzy or ""off"" because, now that the excess chemicals have worn off, your brain has to remember the ""correct"" levels to go back to, which, obviously, takes time.  TL;DR: Feeling crummy can be normal. You brain is simply taking it's time to reestablish equilibrium. [2]"
saplings,3bitcn,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"Whenever this happens, the best thing you can do is completely change your surroundings. This means go to a different room, get some food and water, put on some (different) music or maybe play a video game/watch a movie. Just do something that requires your attention so you don't sink into sitting and brooding about feeling down.  If you get really freaked out, don't be embarrassed to talk to yourself reassuringly. If you're worrying about things, sit down and right about what you're worried about and what you think you need to do. Take a constructive mindset to your negative feelings, view them as a logical result of something (i.e a problem in your life, or even simply you knowing that you're worrying about nothing), and approach them logically. This will take a lot of the worry out of them and help you move on to something else (you can just look at the paper and know you've worked out a solution, rather than constantly going over the same thoughts over and over again in your head). You can also always try and sleep if you're really not enjoying your high; generally you will find it much easier to initiate sleep (even if it feels like it should be harder because your mind feels active), as marijuana induces chemical changes in your brain that promote sleep. Get a nice snack, then lie down in your bed with a TV show or something on, and just lie there with your eyes closed until you drift off.  Also try to smoke less. This will help you remain more in control of your emotions and prevent nasty side-effects such as a crappy mood or burnout.  Finally, if this happens regularly, take it as a sign that maybe smoking is not for you. Some people sadly find that marijuana just ceases to work nicely for them, and so they have to avoid it."

saplings,3bgs6y,AceOfReQuiem,9,Mon Jun 29 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"2 grams is more than enough. Will you be smoking out of a pipe or joints etc? Explain em what to do, when to take a toke and such. Starting of slow is always good. You can ramp it up later.  Make sure you have your foods ready like premade sandwiches or oven baked snacks or something similar, fruit perhaps and DEFINATELY potato chips :P  Same with drinks, fruit drinks are the bomb. Apple juice in particular does well for people and especially for me.  Alcohol and weed dont always mix well. I would suggest staying off the booze.  Have some movies ready to watch (like the new mad max) and have some chill music at hand.  I wouldnt worry about the smell if you dont smoke indoors and no one is around for that day. Make sure you either wash your clothes yourself, perhaps together with your mates'? Your clothes will most likely smell, mayhaps not bad but it will.  Have some really sugary stuff ready if someone goes too high, it helps comming down. You cant die or sustain any injury or permanent damage from weed but you can possibly feel quite bad. Tell em nothing bad can happen beforehand but they might become paranoid (its a known possible side effect). Its a small chance but the chance is there, better take precaution imho, as it is the first time. If they do feel bad, have them do something like playing videogames or play catch with a random (soft) object. It helps taking your mind off the paranoia n stuff.   Ask anything, no question is stupid or dumb ;)  Also, most important thing: Have fun :D"

If it does turn out to be short, then just tell him the last bag was short by x amount.

In other words, from what I've read it's sort of possible but it would take a large amount of grounds to create any meaningful does, more than several vaporizer loads.  Plus I would worry about some of the volatile oils in coffee beans doing strange things to your lungs.  tl;dr it's interesting to think about but I wouldn't do it."

saplings,3bgakg,ddpimpin,2,Mon Jun 29 01:02:35 2015 UTC,It sound's like you've got all of your bases covered. I live in an apartment and have similar gatherings on a regular basis. Consider having a chill or interesting station playing on Panodra or Spotify.  Other than that my only other suggestion would be to tell someone to bring snacks. You may already have a stocked kitchen as I do but every time there is always one or more people that have that one snack that they just need that of course I don't have.  Anyway I hope it goes awesome!

Make sure you have a variety of snacks like pretzels, bagel bites, or maybe a pizza to make later, drinks, and water.  Make sure there are plenty of blankets, pillows, and a comfy, well-made bed for someone to crash in if they start getting the spins and need a dark place to lie down. Comfort is crucial. If your place is hot, get a fan. If it's cold, get a heater. You get the gist.   I like to have candles burning for ambiance and so it smells nice! And CLEAN UP YOUR HOUSE. nothing is more stressful to me when I'm high than a dirty kitchen or bathroom. A clean, serene space is easier on the mind.  Put together a playlist of your favorite songs (I suggest Pink Floyd, Rush, Incubus, and maybe some electronic or classical thrown in there for fun, like Clean Bandit, Haydn, or Liszt. Liszt's first piano concerto in Eb Major is sick, as is Shostakovich's symphony No. 5 if you like something a little darker)  If music isn't your thing, try some movies like Waking Life, A Scanner Darkly, or any Beatles film.   Other than that, don't make anyone smoke any more than they're comfortable with, make sure nobody gets left out, don't let anyone do anything dangerous, and enjoy :)"

saplings,3be5kk,undergroundathiest,11,Sun Jun 28 11:07:05 2015 UTC,Alright I'm gonna do my best. In a blunt the wrap is a lot thicker and often times flavored it's also easier to roll a longer fatter blunt so a blunt tends to take a lot more time and the wrap produces a decent amount of smoke so the feel and taste is altered in my opinion where a joint usually the papers don't add much and so the smoke it a bit smoother and I feel like joints pulls little easier and faster than blunts but that's just how I feel if you roll joints with a filter you might notice the difference between joints and blunts a bit more. But a blunt wrap makes the smoke have a different feel and taste and you really need to try it to understand what I mean. But also in on hydromorphone so I'm not the most clearly speaking person right meow.

saplings,3be5kk,supahflyTNT,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"I find this interesting because I disagree with everything you said. If the bud is ground up I can gut and roll a blunt in a minute. Also I think blunts hit 100x better than joints. The reason being every time I smoke a joint, the paper gets resinated towards the end and as you smoke more and more it is harder to hit. Doesn't happen with blunts. Also papers burn incredibly fast compared to blunts. and oh my god don't get me started on canoes..."
saplings,3be5kk,Hexavxozy,2,Sun Jun 28 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you how to fix every problem you mentioned.   Blunt hits vs joint hits are all up to who rolled them. If they are both superb roll jobs, the joint will be easier to smoke because the tobacco makes the smoke a bit harsher and heavy.   If your joints get resin buildup in the mouth piece, roll with a crutch. Fold a piece of notecard paper 5 times and then wrap it up into a little filter like thing.  Papers don't burn that fast if you double wrap them. It makes it burn smoother, slower, and cooler.  Also, a blunt can canoe just as bad or worse. It's all about who rolls it. Some people are better at rolling."
saplings,3be5kk,Bigfrostynugs,2,Sun Jun 28 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"Nobody wants to double wrap papers on joints, they taste like shit. You shouldn't have to double wrap to get your joints to burn slow if you roll them right."
saplings,3be5kk,Hexavxozy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"Me and my friend roll some of the best joints of the people in my group. I learned from him with the double wrapping thing. The reason you need to double wrap a joint and not a blunt is because a tobbaco leaf is a lot thicker than a single piece of thin joint paper. And just another piece of paper doesn't mean it taste like shit, if you have shit papers, and you put two on, it will taste extra shit."
saplings,3be5kk,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"You don't need to double wrap anything. Maybe you prefer it, but no, it isn't necessary.  I want my weed to taste like weed, not paper. Adding more paper will always make it taste less like weed and more like paper, period. There's just nothing you can do about that, and it doesn't make a difference whether they're good papers or not, they still have a distinct taste that is not weed."
saplings,3be5kk,Hexavxozy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.

saplings,3be5kk,PM_ME_YOUR_BOWL,2,Mon Jun 29 20:44:35 2015 UTC,I was saying that a blunt tends to last longer than joints and are easier to roll. I did say to use a filter with joints or I mentioned them. The smoke from blunts is usually a bit more substantial and I feel joints are an easier pull but that doesn't mean better it's all what people like. You might enjoy the feel of the smoke from a blunt more than a joint I personally like them both for their own unique feels but again I'm on really strong painkillers so I might be hard to understand.

Flushing out the dead zone from smoke reduces the time the smoke stays in contact with sensitive regions, which lessens irritation. Trying to hold in smoke isnt the greatest thing to do to your lungs so its better to just breath slow and deep afterwards."

saplings,3b82re,mole67,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:37:51 2015 UTC,Hell if you're new to smoking and used one the coughing and excess smoke that would drift away would make it much worse of a smell. Also like others said it is like hotboxing your head your face would certainly smell like it.
saplings,3b82re,GeneralRectum,0,Sat Jun 27 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"If you exhale smoke, it will smell. Or vapor. If you consume weed, whatever process gets it out of you will make it smell like weed in that area. Exhaling smoke or vapor, no matter how high tech the device you inhaled it with is, will smell like smoke or vapor. Unfortunately that's just how it works. And eating edibles often gives you some dank smelling poops."

It's much easier on the throat and you can use the abv to make edibles!   I wouldn't worry about smell that much. It is considerably less than the alternate methods."

Some guy in a Youtube video said that you should ""season"" your new vaporizer by setting it to the max heat setting and letting it go through a cycle like that. He said that this will more or less burn away any traces of machining oils that may have been left behind during the manufacturing process, but I'm quite skeptical to believe that ""seasoning"" it is necessary, especially since I've literally only seen a single instance of someone mentioning it."

saplings,3b7ho3,Bigfrostynugs,3,Sun Jun 28 08:06:50 2015 UTC,"A vape high (upon my experience)  differs on which temp you vape at. Lower temps seem to be not an in-your-face experience. More relaxing. At a higher temp it's more like the high you get from smoking.     As for smell, its not nearly as smelly as smoking and the taste is 100 times better! To be safe just leave a window open and shut your vents. Throwing a fan in the window is a bonus. The smell shouldnt really take more than 10 minutes to air out"

(assuming you arent hiding it from anyone) vapes will air out no more than 2 hours. again thats just my experience though"

Did it a few times and got the reaction you just described. Munchies, thirst, red eyes but no crazy/creative thoughts. But probably you and me, we had some really weird stuff to say but no one to talk to. So you can't really judge by yourself if your brain makes awesome shit up or not.  When I smoke with my best friends, basically every weekend, we always have such a good time (we would have without it too I guess) and laugh our asses off while being creative like da vinci himself. At least that's what we're thinking.   Try it out. Getting high with your #besties is not even comparable to getting high all alone or with smoking buds.  Edit: I guess the throat thingy differentiates between individuals."

I think everyone gets affected differently though.  I find that if I smoke a bowl 30 minutes after smoking a bowl, the second one won't really get me that high, more faded if anything.  As far as the throat burning goes, hard to say.  The more you smoke the quicker it'll stop though.  Even then, I've been smoking for years and some pieces and bud are just harsh."

saplings,3b7ucw,gameofthroffice,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"This question is not really asked all that much, to be honest.   By the time you no longer call yourself a sapling, you realize that just knowing that measurement in weed is rarely due to quantity alone. Most people just get a simple kitchen scale and use it to this effect.   In the general sense an ounce of pot will be about the size of a full quart Ziploc baggie. (full, but not bursting by the seams) Again, this is vague and general, and does not apply to all strains in all circumstances.   Generally an eighth should only be 3 or 4 good nugs (or a few more small ones).  You can slide that scale up and down depending on your own measurements.   I don't know why you would want to forget about price and quality though... that is the name of the game. Quality always comes first. You only need half of the good quality weed to get you as high as the standard or substandard stuff. Price comes second, how much for the really good quality versus the less potent stuff."

Just be firm, rational and respectful. Either he denies it or he acknowledges it. Either way I wouldn't buy from him or smoke him out anymore. It took me far too long to learn the difference between smoking/drinking buddies and friends. If he is willing to steal from you he is not a friend, no matter what he has taught you, just someone you happen to get high with. Trust me there are millions and most won't steal from and lie to you. I would just be straight up and let him know that his grams are always short and since you have gotten more connects you realized he is ripping you off. Honestly I would have called someone out if they pretended to load a bowl immediately. That's just some sneaky bullshit. Fuck that guy."
saplings,3b4tf6,supahflyTNT,10,Fri Jun 26 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Buy a scale to make sure he is ripping you off. Then if he definetly is just be a man and tell him to stop being a dick. If he's a good friend he'll be apologetic and if he's not then good riddance, you don't need those people in your life. One of the ways I know I have my best friend is we always just smoke each other out and I try to make sure I don't smoke more of his weed than he does mine and vice versa."
saplings,3b4tf6,ld436,2,Fri Jun 26 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely buy a scale. Since weed is generally sold by weight, it always matters how dense the stuff is.

The only time I really worry about cleaning my dry pieces is when they get clogged or super duper  nasty, whichever comes first. Two good things about letting it build up are that if you have a gold/silver fumed piece it really makes the color change pop,  and if you ever end up dry at any point you can scrape the bowl with a screwdriver or small knife or something,  I actually use my pick tool that I have for dabbing.  Depending on how much you've smoked out of that piece you ought to end up with a decent sized ball of resin that you can smoke. It sounds nasty, but it doesn't really taste like much and if you really need a toke it'll do the trick."

But you have to smoke more and more if you want to be able to smoke more and still have a decent conversation.   My experience was that I hung out with people who smoked a shit ton, so I smoked a lot with them and embarrassed myself a few times being stupidly high around them, but after a while my body just got used to smoking a gram a day."
saplings,3b3db6,holden-on,5,Thu Jun 25 17:42:52 2015 UTC,"For me, it's like this: I buy a gram and put .2 in a joint, I smoke it and I'm high. I can keep this up for a few weeks. After a few weeks I want to get a bit higher so I put in .3 grams. After a while those .3 grams get me about as high as the .2 used to get me. This slowly increases my tolerance. Hanging out with friends and smoking a shitload with them doesn't help either.   Whenever I notice I burn trough more than a gram a week on my own, I start a t break or I just go back to the .2 grams for a while."

saplings,3b21gy,ExtremelyDazed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:44:55 2015 UTC,"In the recipe it says you need cannabutter, but if you don't have any, it has steps to make some. The steps were grind it and throw it in the butter before you bake the brownies. In reality, you should decarb the weed first, and do a slow extraction of thc and strain out the bud, not just throw it together and eat it"
saplings,3b21gy,bootypastry,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:40:06 2015 UTC,"Essentially It's Thc that gets your high right? Well weed has some Thc that's not been activated yet. You decarb it (heat it enough that it activates but doesn't vaporise or combust/set on fire) so you can get most of the Thc ready for your body.  If you just grind up weed and stick it in a recipe it's not going to work very well. Thats because some of the Thc is ready to go but a lot is binded with water. So you want to chemically heat it enough that the water evaporated but the Thc remains, then it's ready to bind to fat.  The reason edibles work is that the Thc binds to fat which the body absorbs. So you want to decarb it first so you can get more high later. Normally the fat people use is butter but milk can work too."

Sativa is a head-high that makes you more alert. With this in mind it's down to your personal preference. Edibles are definitely stronger considering when you smoke it you're burning away some of the THC so just bare that in mind."

You could store your weed elsewhere, or he could agree to let you keep a very small amount at a time that you plan to smoke very soon.

Just talk :) And then smoke him out because siblings who smoke together are awesome."

Anyway, I came up with possibly THE best stash spot ever, so if I show him that, I think he might be ok with it.  (if you want to know my stash spot plan, I own these speakers, and you can open em up and put stuff inside, but it requires going through 4 screws that have hex heads, so it's a real pain if you aren't planning on doing that ahead of time)  Tl;Dr my parents look through everything in my house, that's why he's worried, but I got a dope stash spot."

Also be careful where you keep your piece if you have one since it'll smell a ton after you smoke even if you clean out most of the ash.

Because the alternative is shit. Either I help her, or she has to do it on her own. She will get ripped off, she will get shorted, she may get robbed, and she will run the risk of getting arrested every time she makes a deal. That scares the fuck out of me. I went through that period, and I'm sure your brother did too. And considering that it was your brother that smoked you out, I am pretty confident in saying that he doesn't want you to get fucked over in any of the ways a drug deal can fuck you over.

They filter the smoke enough to make a smoother hit but won't get you as high as a bong would. If you need a small, discreet, enjoyable smoking experience that is easy to hide and portable, I'd personally find a little bubbler between 30-50$. If you have any further questions feel free to ask!

saplings,3azjvt,RandomGuyinACorner,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:30:53 2015 UTC,I second the bubbler idea. I love my bubbler and it is very easy to keep hidden. Some people complain about having to fill it with water and stuff but if you don't have access to water you can just smoke it like a pipe.
saplings,3azjvt,StoppedLurking_ZoeQ,3,Thu Jun 25 02:23:04 2015 UTC,Vape are expensive upfront but they extract so much more thc and cannabinoids that they actually save you that money in the long run. add another $50 to your budget and you'll save that $100 by the end of the year. Burning weed actually destroys many of the trichomes so you're getting less while vaporizing brings them to their boiling point but not further.
saplings,3azjvt,RandomGuyinACorner,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:04:33 2015 UTC,Plus not to mention how you can keep your left over abv (already vaped bud) and reuse it later for an amazing high.  If you're short on money it's worth the investment. Need less weed to get high and can get more high for your buck.
saplings,3azjvt,The_Jangler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well this depends on how much you extract from your material. I usually vape my stuff to max on my volcano at the end of the night to get sleepy and it gets a dark coffee brown. Tried eating 3g oil caplets' that I cooked and didn't feel anything. If you're someone who vapes light temps and or has a vape with less capability of full extraction like my mflb, then you'll have more bang in your abv. I just prefer to vape it instead of eat ít."

If you're really set on just combusting your herb then just a pipe is probably a better option depending on how big your school is and your cop activity you might not want a piece that you bring back. I typically carve an apple pipe since it works to get you pretty toasty and can then be tossed like the butt of a joint."

Doesn't have to be anything fancy, they go for about the same price as a glass pipe, 15 to 30+ if it's a really well made one. If you're not familiar with chillums here is a picture of one. They're basically just a straight pipe, I like to relate them to one hitters because they're basically just bigger versions and more. Like pipes they come in all different sizes and designs.  I love smoking out of chillums, they hit hard and they're also very discreet as well. Hope this will help change things up a bit!"

The difference between ""head"" and ""body"" highs in all modern strains pretty much comes down to the ratio between THC and some of the other compounds you end up taking in at the same time when you smoke. The more THC there is, the headier the high will be.  THC also vaporizes at a lower temperature than some of these other compounds, so if you vaporize at 370F-375F or lower, you can enhance the headiness of a high. Conversely if you smoke or eat the ABV left over from this experience, possibly pairing it with some fresh cannabis, that will lead to much more of a body high."

If you have a shitty grower, with a sativa plant and an indica plant, but they have awful conditions, you wont get NEARLY the same highs as you would from professionally grown good cured buds.   If you smoke some real GDP (especially extracts), and then smoke some green crack, blue dream, or white widow, you will feel WAY different.   The effects are much much much more pronounced in concentrates."

Everyone else around you is likely high, and regardless they know you're high so they're not judging you.  You'll probably regularly say silly stuff/forget what you're saying, that just comes with smoking weed. If you smoke regularly it tends to get easier to keep a clear head, but I'd advise against it simply because at the same time you simply don't get as high as you do when you smoke irregularly."
saplings,3ary36,austin_97,8,Tue Jun 23 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen this happen with pretty much any weed on occasion, sativa or indica.  Generally the best way to avoid it is as follows:  A) Avoid being sleep deprived when you smoke. Sleep deprivation in general makes your more predisposed to tremors (particularly in the fingers and eyes), and also increases the risk of other negative side-effects like anxiety and brain fog.  B) If you haven't eaten a substantial meal within the last 3-4 hours, either drink a gatorade/powerade/coconut water/vegetable cocktail aka V8 (all great sources of electrolytes that are absorbed quickly), or regular water with a good source of sodium and potassium. The sodium part is pretty easy as our diets are very sodium heavy (check the label on the back, 10-20% daily value should be sufficient for your snack). As for potassium, bananas are good and very cheap sources. If you're not a fan of their taste on their own, they're great in smoothies with vanilla yogurt, a little bit of ice, and strawberries.  When you haven't eaten in a while or have just finished some moderate to intense exercise, you tend to be low on electrolytes as the body does not really maintain long-term stores of them unlike most vitamins. When your body has less electrolytes to work with, nerve signalling tends to be less efficient and minor dysfunction begins to occur (cramping, spasms, eye twitches, etc). This can be exacerbated by cannabis, as it can often stimulate muscle activity in some people and on some occasions.  C) Try a magnesium supplement. Most Western diets are slightly deficient in magnesium to various degrees (not enough to cause serious dysfunction or illness, but enough to possibly cause minor dysfunction depending on the individual), and so you may benefit from a small magnesium supplement. I'd recommend one 200 mg pill of either magnesium diglycinate/glycinate (ideal, less likely to cause minor side-effects like loose poops) or magnesium citrate daily.  Magnesium is involved in regulating the threshold of stimulation at which a neuron will fire, both in the brain and in muscle tissue, and so a magnesium deficiency places neurons in a hypersensitive state. This can manifest as anxiety (amongst other things) in the brain, and twitching in muscle tissue.  Magnesium is completely safe to supplement unless you take an obscene amount at once. The limit for supplementation should be 400 mg daily, however half of that is usually more than enough to accomplish your goal of buffering your intake from food if you're not severely deficient. I'd let your doctor know you're taking it, just in case that fact is ever relevant to medical advice/decisions they give you.  You can purchase magnesium online, or from most grocery/superstores (I recommend online from iherb.com though, most stores overprice their supplements to take advantage of uninformed people).  D) Avoid combining marijuana with caffeine. Increased muscle twitching is a common side-effect of caffeine, even at levels present in regular pop like Coca Cola. So combining this with marijuana could cause pronounced twitching. Note that the ADD drugs Ritalin/Concerta/Adderall also often cause this side-effect.  E) Make sure you're not sitting in tight positions for long periods of time. I find when I'm stoned I tend to sit in really strange ways for hours sometimes, which can cause some minor muscle cramping/spasms. Try getting up and moving around for a minute or two every hour. This also helps to keep you perky and extend your high."

saplings,3asj50,Shatteredreality,4,Tue Jun 23 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Greetings my young Padawan Ent! As far as the social anxiety goes, the only way to find out is to try it. When you go into the dispensary, ask about different strains and  it would probably help to buy a gram or so of an indica, sativa, and a blend. Indicas are generally super mellow and very very relaxing (a good way to remember this is: indica/ in da couch... as in melt into the couch). Some people really like them for this reason and they're great after a long day of work, not so great for wake and bakes before going about your day. Sativas on the other hand make you feel like a little kid who's seeing the world for the first time and have always made me feel like I want to go out and do stuff, they make running errands and cleaning the house super fun. Personally, I've always favored sativa strains for this reason. Sativa strains tend to be more fun for me. Also keep in mind that there's all sorts of blends out there so try a bunch of them and see what you like. Also since we're talking about SA here, you probably wouldn't want to get high for the first time around a bunch of people because extreme paranoia is a thing that can (and probably will) happen, especially if you've never done it before. If you start to experience any paranoia, here are some things to remember: this is not permanent.   You have a prescription so you will not get in trouble for this. People probably won't know about this unless you tell them. Even if they did, it's all good. Also the smell won't stick to things forever so don't worry. Last thing is don't worry, just relax, put on a movie that you like, get some food that you like and have fun! Also don't be afraid to try different ways of getting that wonderful molecule into your brain. You don't have to smoke it (this can be harsh if you're not used to it) there's also edibles and you can get it in a liquid that can be vaporized. Keep in mind that edibles and vapor are generally smoother on your body, however, the psychoactive effects are often much more intense. Be careful, go easy on it in the beginning. This is especially true for edibles because they take a really long time to take effect, so people will eat a cookie, wait an hour, not feel anything, then eat 7 more and get waaaay more than they bargained for and have a bad time. Other things like lip balm, dermal patches and other alternatives to traditional combustion tend to not be as potent and or not do anything psychoactive at all, so beware. Some people get way too high and tend to freak out, it can be intense but my though has always been : ""too high? COOL! Let's see how far this train can go!"" I've never been TOO stoned. Also edibles and vapor have virtually no odor and whatever odor there is will be gone in seconds. If you decide to smoke it and are worried about the smell, just open a window and turn on the fan. As for price, expect to pay around $15/ $18 per gram... I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's the going rate in legal states... semi legal any way. Well I hope this was helpful, happy toking my friend!"
saplings,3asj50,Donatelloobediah,2,Tue Jun 23 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"1.) Although i'm personally unsure of it's effects on depression, I have a friend who fell into a deep depression after losing her mother at a young age. After countless antidepressants, she found weed as the best side effect free solution. I have used weed personally for social anxiety, and until I got treatment for it in the form of counseling, I found it worked exceedingly well.  2.) If you plan to use medical, learn the difference between sativa and indica.  3.) Edibles are a great alternative, and there are thousands of forms of them, anything from pot brownies to pot root beer.  4.) If you use just enough for treatment, expect to buy an eighth (40$  where I am, 3.5 grams) a week per person if you want to smoke flowers. If not, a medium-strong edible can last you 4-6 hours, but the cost can vary depending upon what form it is in."
saplings,3asj50,rockitude129,2,Tue Jun 23 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'll give you some tips :)  I would definitely recommend cannabis for your and your wife, especially with those issues you stated, there's nothing you can lose, either it helps and you manage to deal with the issues or it doesn't and you stop using it.  You should know that cannabis is nothing to be afraid of. For a first time consumer it can get a little scary, since you're not yet familiar with what cannabis does to your body and mind, but don't freak out, as I said there is nothing to be afraid of, just enjoy the experience.  Over time you will learn what it does to you and you will also learn to control your body and mind more.  When high, be sure to drink a lot of water, since it's very important you stay hydrated, and also because water is always good :)  Also when high, you may perceive things differently, try not to get freaked out or anxious about that and just enjoy, as I said earlier, just enjoy the experience.  Don't be afraid to laugh. A lot. Everything might be insanely hilarious to you, if so, don't be afraid to show it, laugh out loud and enjoy yourself :)  About smoke, I also happen to hate it. I especially hate tobacco, since all it does to me is it gets me nauseous and kinda ruins my high, so I would definitely recommend picking up a vaporiser in the future when you get familiar with cannabis. /r/vaporents can help you with a decision if you decide to buy one, which I personally absolutely recommend, since it has so many benefits, and also has no smoke.   ALSO: I really like what /u/donatelloobediah wrote down. ""Some people get way too high and tend to freak out, it can be intense but my though has always been : ""too high? COOL! Let's see how far this train can go!""   This is what I was trying to tell when I said just enjoy the high. Once you get experienced and you know there's literally nothing bad can happen, and you stop having the fear of ""oh what if I get too high"", you really start enjoying more.  Hope I provided some information you might have been looking for, and if you do decide to go through with it, I welcome you to the family my friend :)"
saplings,3asj50,Need4Trees,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"1) Can't help too much on that, I find it improves my mood and makes me more in touch  2) Familiarize yourself with the basic differences between an indica (stronger more sink into your couch high) and a sativa (more aware and wanting to experience things high). Check online for strain info. Leafly is my go to since it has info on the strain as well as reviews (and dispensaries nearby that sell it, but that isn't relevant for me).  3) Edibles are an option but they can have a lengthy come on (seem to take 2-3 hours for me so I tend to use another method). Vaporizers are a great option, they basically heat the herb enough to release the THC, might lose some of the other more medicinal chemicals this way (I'm not too sure since I just use for fun so I don't mind)  4) I pay $35-40 for 3.5 grams of flower, but those are street prices, not sure what a dispensary charges but you can probably check online"

saplings,3at1bs,dahimi,2,Tue Jun 23 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest thing for you to do is to stop over thinking it, and go to that dispensary, and tell them you know nothing about it etc, and they should be happy to guide you to what product(s) are best for you. Pre-rolled joints or edibles would be my recommendations for an inexperienced individual.   If you do try edibles, be patient and careful. The effects can take 2 hours to kick in, and if you eat more of them during that time, you might get uncomfortably high.  Lastly, happy birthday! :D"
saplings,3ascbk,BWDpodcast,6,Tue Jun 23 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"I know exactly the feeling you're talking about. Here's some tips I've discovered over time:  A) Have a stimulating activity read to go as soon as you're done smoking. If you're confident outside while high, immediately go for a walk (though make sure you don't bring any weed or paraphernalia so you don't have to worry about the rare run-in with a bored cop). Video games are also good. Movies can be a good choice, but I personally prefer to leave them for when I'm coming down, unless I have a very intense selection ready.  My favourite thing to do is get together a bunch of my favourite tracks, crank up the speakers and just go crazy. Love those nights of blasting Guns N Roses tracks while singing and air-guitaring for hours. Give yourself complete freedom to be silly and simultaneously feel badass :)  B) Make sure you've eaten a decent meal within the last 3 hours before smoking. I find that if I'm already hungry when I smoke up, I tend to get very food-focused and the high is much simpler. Drinking a glass of water 10 mins before is another good habit to have.  C) Don't let yourself eat anything more than a very light snack (like some fruit) while high. As you said, it's very tempting to gorge on candy/shitty foods when high, and doing so often causes your blood sugar to skyrocket for 20 minutes or so. This can make you feel groggy and lazy by itself, let alone combined with weed. Even though most bodies can rapidly restore normal blood sugar levels via insulin release, I find the effects can persist for a while and generally ruin the rest of the high unless I'm ready to crash.  When you're ready to indulge a bit, I highly recommend candies that are difficult to gorge on. Hard candies are great, because they take a while to consume (and thus no sugar crash), but are still very satisfying. As for meal-type food, try deviating from the cliche weed foods. While things like pizza have very intense pleasurable tastes, more complex food like salads, soups (avoid extremely salty canned soups though, they tend to be fairly underwhelming even when high), sushi, etc, tend to offer a much more fulfilling experience. You'll find you can taste a complex bouquet of flavour that you'd never get from pizza or taco bell.  D) Don't smoke too much at the start, but also don't smoke too little. Too much will couch lock you no matter how great of a sativa it is. Too little will leave you feeling frustrated and underwhelmed.  The best strategy is to take very small hits spread out over chunks of 5 minutes (you may find you need 10 minutes for each dose to fully kick in). You'll only need to do this a few times before you get a good idea of your personal range of effective dose levels.  E) Try smoking, and then having a conversation with a close friend about whatever topics occur to you. As you noticed, conversations while lightly stoned are great (be careful about being too stoned though, things can get confusing and sometimes a bit anxiety-inducing for some people), you get really into them and derive a lot of satisfaction going over a range of topics. Of course, this only works if your friend is stoned too, otherwise the disconnect in your mental state can make things a little awkward."
saplings,3ascbk,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice, but the first step is finding a strain or strain makeup that works well for my personal situation (one-hit wonder, doesn't get much of anything good from most strains). Any advice on finding a good one?"
saplings,3ascbk,GetOutOfBox,2,Tue Jun 23 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have experience with a few as I had some time on the silkroad getting legit weed in the mail rather than from a dealer. Here's the few memorable ones I've enjoyed:  Grand Daddy Purple: Lots of fakes because it's easy to cheat to get the colour by stressing any marijuana plant. A truly trippy and intoxicating high. Very nice body sensations, but also an almost shroom like high. Visual distortion, time warping, etc. This might be too intense if you're not confident yet, but believe it or not it was the first weed I ever smoked. I felt prepared however as I had heavily researched it and was confident of what to expect.  Kali Mist: A very friendly strain. A very energizing, clear high that is not sleep inducing. Be careful not to overdo it because it can get overwhelming, but it's pretty easy to figure out what your comfortable level is.  Purple Kush: Toned down Grand Daddy Purple. Much more chill high, basically a nice balance between relaxing and energizing. Probably the most comfortable starter weed. You'll really enjoy it, but it won't fuck you up.  Green Crack: Extremely fun high, not necessarily trippy, but just very giggly and entertaining. Great for parties as it doesn't seem to make people shell up like some strains can.  Skywalker OG: Probably the safest starter weed. Very relaxing, and chilled vibes. This is great to just put on a movie with some snacks. The high slows you down, but I've never noticed increased anxiety levels so I find it easier to act sober when necessary.  Harlequin: Very unlike most weed. This strain doesn't produce a 'high' at all like most strains, and is actually used to treat conditions like social anxiety, schizophrenia, chronic pain, etc. It is unique in that it has a THC:CBD ratio of 2:5 making it amongst a few strains that have greater amounts of CBD than THC. Because of this, the potentially psychotic-triggering side-effect of THC is virtually absent, and instead there seems to be a novel antipsychotic/anxiolytic/antidepressant effect due to unique effects upon the brain's cannabinoid receptors. TL;DR Great medical strain. Not for getting high."
saplings,3ar3pg,Intracelestial,3,Mon Jun 22 20:48:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure anything that has resin is considered paraphernalia. This could be a bowl, grinder, or possibly even that lighter that has resin on it if there is enough where a cop could look at it and say ""yup, this is weed resin"" but on that lighter thing I doubt they would do anything. You can drive anywhere with glass as long as it's 100 percent clean. Blunt wraps, cigars and papers usually aren't considered paraphernalia but if paired with a grinder or weed they could throw it under a paraphernalia charge.

I've seen grinders go for anywhere between $7-$40 (that's USD), but you usually get what you pay for. Plastic/acrylic is another option, but I don't recommend this type because they don't usually do their job as well as the metal ones. There are also ceramic grinders, which do a pretty good job and are often more decorative than the metal or plastic types. Some have multiple compartments and a kief collector, which you may or may not want. Hope this helps! Happy toking!"

saplings,3apwnz,senitel10,6,Mon Jun 22 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"OP, if you work out more than four times a week, especially consecutively, don't use eye drops each time. There is a chemical/vasoconstrictor that your eyes can relatively build a ""dependence"" on.   Your eyes will get red even at a [0] if you use them too much, because the body adapts to the effects of the vasoconstrictor, which it thinks is the new ""normal"" condition of the eye.  There is additionally a preservative in many of the common eye drop brands (rohtos, clear eyes, visine) that is actually quite harmful in the context of long-term usage. This preservative is helpful in effectively eliminating the chance of an eye infection (google that, it's not something I would wish on an enemy), but can promote corneal tearing if used once everyday/every other day.  To avoid these problems, use eye drops with slogans or adjectives like ""artificial tears"" or salt water eye drops, and avoid eye drops that talk about ""getting the red out.""   These alternative eye drops are not nearly as effective as the common ones like clear eyes and visine, but they should do the job if you apply them enough, and they are much safer for long-term use.  Please don't take my word on this; search on this subreddit and trees for other people's experience with long term eye drop use and also read some of the scientific literature on this as well. I'm sorry I don't have access to any particular papers at the moment as I'm on mobile."

saplings,3apwnz,StJupiter,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:05:52 2015 UTC,Well long story short all you will need is at least 1 drop per eye. Don't douse your eyes with the stuff. Just one drop is good each eye and you won't have to worry about that.

Checked baggage, since you can't access it during the flight, has a bit more leniency than people realize. I had 2 pocketknives and various chemicals in my checked baggage before, and the security didn't care.   Have you used the pipe yet at all, for any reason? If you haven't, and they question you about it, just say that you thought it was a cool looking piece and decided to get it. There's no evidence to say you've done anything with it otherwise. The lighter is also negligible; everyone carries lighters. If you've used the pipe at all, even just for tobacco, you may have a hard time, but that's if they care about it.

As long as the pipe is not metal it should be allowed in your carry-on and if its metal i think if its less than 6-inches worst case scenario is they find it be like you cant have this in your carry-on and then they take it. but if you cannot let that happen then don't take the risk i guess. but with the checked bag put it in a pocket like you said and then put that piece of clothing in a plastic bag then put all your dirty clothes in one plastic bag and all your clean clothes in another that way you reduce the risk of them unpacking it assuming it is a shared checked bag. if not shard just put it between some clothes so it doesn't break."

I'm not sure where you live, but I don't know anywhere where the average parent would be 100% cool with their kid telling them they smoke weed. In most places it's very common for parents to freak out thinking their child is already on the way to becoming a crackhead, even if the parents are fairly moderate towards pot in general. The fact is, most parents tend to worry a great deal more about their children, and sometimes that puts them in a position where they can't think reasonably in regards to something like this.  I of course would never encourage a minor to lie to their parents or smoke weed, and I agree that if possible it's best to be honest with your parents about this kind of thing. However I can definitely understand people being afraid to tell them."

saplings,3aneog,ThatDudeYouSortaKnow,7,Sun Jun 21 22:49:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. While you could argue there are trace amounts of THC there, I think your mates are just pulling your leg.  Yes, it does reduce the decay of cannabinoids (the active compounds in cannabis) but this should only be noticeable over the course of 6+ months. Any shorter than that and it's not generally worth the hassle, one of the reasons I'll explain next. Cannabis buds are covered in gland structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the most concentrated portions of the plant when it comes to THC and other cannabinoids. It's also known as keif or what simply gives buds their frosty appearance. When stored in the freezer they become brittle and more easily break off the plant; If you have a grinder with a keif catch then putting it in the freezer for 10 minutes and giving it a good healthy 30s long shake will allow you to collect more keif. Some people don't like separating the two which is why storing in the freezer may not be ideal for them."

saplings,3aneog,thebrokenghost,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:56:32 2015 UTC,"The ""boost"" in your high from eating a roach or filter is negligible, practically nonexistent.

You can store weed in an airtight jar in the back of the fridge or the freezer and it'll definitely last longer, but it will probably dry out a lot too. Nothing wrong with that, it'll just be harsher when you smoke it. If you put a nickel or dime in your grinder, refrigerate or freeze it for a bit, and then shake the hell out of your grinder, you will get a lot of kief out of it (provided your grinder has a kief-catcher, of course). The only downside with this is that, since you just knocked a lot of the kief away, your fresh ground might be less potent, but if you have strong stuff anyway it won't really be an issue. Besides, I prefer sessions where my high builds gradually, rather than really fast, so decreased potency might be fun to try. Old Hippie agrees too!"

saplings,3an54f,dahimi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:39:40 2015 UTC,50mg is a lot for an edible unless your tolerance is high.   I'm about a once per week user and find that 15mg is pretty good.    My suggestion would be to eat a quarter of the brownie and wait an hour or two to see how it affects you.
saplings,3an54f,savagestarshine,2,Tue Jun 23 03:16:40 2015 UTC,"if you eat about an hour/ hour & a half before eating the brownie, it will last even longer. last time i had a brownie (don't remember how much was in it) it lasted for a couple of days. don't know if you want to do that for your first time eating. it'll still last much longer than smoking without it.  if it does turn out to be too much / uncomfortable high, just remember that you'll get through it, it will pass, you'll be fine. just put on some nice cartoons to get you through it. when i was way too damn high, i was breathing funny for a couple of hours which felt like a day at the time. kung fu panda & the good bits of Fantasia & Moving Art (those nature shots set to music on netflix) got me through it. Sunrise Earth is also good for that, only just the atmospheric noise instead of kinda crappy music."

saplings,3ajkp3,Afrew,3,Sat Jun 20 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"joints have three problems. 4. 5.  you are burning your weed instead of cooking it, so you lose some.  vapor is smoother than smoke, better for you.  you are inhaling burnt paper.  some of the smoke goes into the room instead of into you.  if you are smorking with somebody, they will hold the joint while they rant on about pink floyd's drummer, instead of puff puff pass. it's called bogarting."
saplings,3ajkp3,Eftir,3,Sat Jun 20 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"Carcinogens are found in any plant-matter, so smoking weed is going to have carcinogens in the smoke, just like cigarettes. Smoking anything will introduce carcinogens into your lungs. On top of that, there are also still things tar and other nasties that can scuff up the delicate air-sacs within your lungs that allow you to efficiently breathe in the first place. More or less, smoking joints is similarly harmful as smoking cigarettes, although possibly with less severity.  You know how you cough really hard sometimes when you smoke? That partially has to do with the smoke itself, especially since it's so hot, which slightly damages your airways every time you take a hit. Now, your throat, sinuses, and nasal passages can more or less heal from this, but your lungs will always have a tiny bit of scarring left behind from inhaling smoke. I'm not saying this to scare you, because you damage your lungs every time you stand next to a running vehicle too, I'm just giving you all the information I can.  Aside from vaporizers being much healthier for you and much easier on your airways, they are also significantly more efficient than any other method of inhaling heated marijuana. Joints, bongs (of any type), and pipes will all deliver about 30% or so of the original THC within the plant. When you are putting the flame to the ground bud, you are actually incinerating some of the various types of cannabinoids before they are actually absorbed by your body. Vaporizers, on the other hand, can deliver a whopping 90% or more of the original THC, and this is without inhaling harmful smoke. This is because the heat is not only controlled better than a flame, but is also at a much lower temperature, allowing you to bring the different types of cannabinoids to just the right temperatures they need to be to evaporate into the vapor you inhale, rather than combusting into smoke."
saplings,3ajkp3,terevabrother,2,Sun Jun 21 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been proven to be very harming in medical tests, but that doesn't mean it's good. Vapes can be really expensive, but they pay off in time because it's a much more efficient way to smoke (for lack of a better word). The main thing is that joint can be harsh on the lungs in the sense that it might be raw for a little bit."

Some indicas are genetically 100% indica, while others might have been originally crossed with a hybrid. It's possible you'd be able to differentiate them by how much of a head high you feel."
saplings,3ajz27,CreeperDays,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:13:10 2015 UTC,How about with taste? Sativas and Idicas I can tell no problem. But for the most part between two of the same type (indica or sativa) they are virtually the same.
saplings,3ajz27,CreeperDays,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"You should be able to tell the difference in taste between different strains. Something like Blue Dream tastes significantly different from Lemon Diesel, and if they don't, chances are the bud wasn't cured properly. No offense, but it's possible the weed you're getting just isn't cured very well, so it all just tastes like smoke rather than smoke+tastiness.  Not sure your experience with cannabis, but once you come across a particularly tasty specimen, you'll know. The flavor saturates your tongue right after the smoke, and stays in your mouth for like a half hour afterwards if the weed is good enough.  Sorry if I'm rambling, at a nice [6] right now."

Think about using your cheeks to pull smoke from the pipe into your mouth, no breathing involved.  Your cheeks will slightly pucker in.  You start out with not much room inside your mouth, and slowly increase the space, and it will fill with smoke.  Then you take your big breath of fresh air to bring the smoke into your lungs."

Get smoke in your mouth, do that.  Other thing, so I'm a swimmer and I had the same problem with using a snorkel (coaches make us use them sometimes, I don't know) and I'd always get water through my nose. I ended up having to use something that pinched my nose. Eventually, I just kept doing it (and kept swallowing gallons of water) and I learned to get the feel for it.

If you don't wait, and it turns out you needed to, you're fucked.   Risk/reward analysis suggests you just wait to smoke until you are certain you're in the clear.   All of that said, it is your choice if you choose to take the risk, so here's the info you asked for. If you used a test with a cutoff of 50 ng/ml, you're probably fine, because that's the standard cutoff and a pass is a pass no matter how faint the line.   Good luck either way, mate."
saplings,3agm17,Afrew,7,Sat Jun 20 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"You can smoke abv (already been vaped) bud and still get high, though it's a bit different from smoking un-vaped bud since a lot of the thc will be gone from vaping and you'll get a higher ratio of the cbds, leaving the high a bit more mellow and different. Some people use abv for edibles which I do occasionally but honestly I just like to save up my abv and then smoke a few bowls of it when I'm dry or going for a different high."
saplings,3agm17,EntBlossom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:42:22 2015 UTC,How is that high different from a normal high?
saplings,3agm17,EntBlossom,2,Sun Jun 21 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"Well don't quote me on this because I'm not exactly a weed scientist or anything. But like I said if you smoke abv it will have a lot less thc to cbd ratio since you vaped away a bit of the thc. The cbd is what makes you more sleepy, calm, tired, etc. if I remember correctly. A lot of extracts and weed grown for medical purposes will have higher cbd contents and lower thc contents in the purpose of pain killing and the like. Thus smoking abv which has a higher ratio of cbd to thc will mor often than not have a different feel to it since you're more vivdly experiencing the cbd effects as opposed to the possible overpowering of the thc. Something like that ... I think."
saplings,3agm17,EntBlossom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. I've looked up some stuff (and also asked some friends) about this and that's generally what they say too. How does a high from CBD feel different from one brought on by THC? Is CBD a ""body high""? Do you physically feel different, or just kind of sedated? I've noticed that some things physically feel better or amplified when I'm high."
saplings,3agm17,cartruck42,2,Sun Jun 21 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain the cbd gives off the sedating effect more so than a ""body high"" since usually indica is associated with body high and sativa is associated with head high, leaving cbd to the sedation. But I'm not entirely sure."

saplings,3agm17,TinyEars7,2,Sat Jun 20 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"The head high feels really clear, trippy, and more energetic/happy. Body high is the heavy, relaxed, sedative feeling. You'll still get a bit of each but it will lean one way or the other. It depends a lot on the strain of weed too though. Some sativa strains don't really give much of a body high at all, but they're rare especially if weed is illegal where you are. Your likely smoking mostly indica dominant or hybrid strains anyway."

Except for smoke that escapes (a cherried bowl, for example), it will also neutralize the odor.  As for myself, I usually smoke outside, but when I smoke in my room, I just open my door/window and blow the smoke out.  Meanwhile I have a fragrant candle (it matters which fragrance, some cover better than others) burning, and I'll extinguish a wick or two to add some non-weed smoke to cover any potential weed smoke that managed to escape into my room."

By 20 minutes I'd say I was fully high.  If you start smoking lots you'll get to the point where you get high the moment you finish the hit, but honestly I recommend not smoking too much as it really gets significantly less powerful in it's effects.

saplings,3aflah,upfrontdaemon,3,Mon Jun 22 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"Smoking marijuana from a pipe is often considered more efficient than smoking a rolled joint, but in general I have found little difference; because a cherry exists both inside the bowl and on the tip of the joint, uninhaled burning plant matter will occur either way. That said, making a pipe is often less time-consuming than learning to roll a joint, so you might want to find an apple, remove the stem, carve a small hole through the side to the center, and then down from where the stem was removed to meet the other hole. Using a grinder, scissors, or your thumbnails, break a quarter- to half-gram up into tiny pieces and pack it into the indentation atop the apple. Voila, you have a bowl ready to smoke. If you're not the DIY type, any tobacconists in your town likely have inexpensive metal or glass pipes for sale in their shop for as low as $5-$10; glass tends to be preferred in most situations.  I personally smoke joints, but I was rolling cigarettes from the time I was 11, so it just comes naturally to me. There are many great videos online that will show you how to roll a joint, if that's your interest, and if your manual dexterity isn't quite where you'd want it to be, Zig Zag and other rolling paper companies sell ""rolling machines"" which will help you produce a smooth, round joint much easier. To avoid wasting plant matter in the ""roach"" end of the joint (the end you are smoking from), a thin piece of cardboard can be rolled into a ""crutch"" to serve as the place to put your lips or fingers, preventing burning, wasted plant matter, and serve as catch for any oils leaking down during smoking."
saplings,3aflah,sevencorvina,3,Fri Jun 19 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"Also, there's nothing as satisfying as smoking a joint. I have two vapes, a couple of pieces, and a bong, but nothing feels better than smoking a nice doob after a long day."

saplings,3aflah,perksbeingwallflower,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:16:27 2015 UTC,The little bit of weed which stays red (burning). It's an issue with bowls/pipes and papers because you're just burning weed without inhaling it.
saplings,3aflah,_A_Good_Name_,2,Tue Jun 23 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"Bowls or pipes are more efficient than joints. That's probably why he recommended them, on top of this they might be a little easier to do (as rolling is an art, my friend) and the smoke might be easier to handle. You could stop by a local smoke shop (if you're 18) and pick up a small glass pipe, or order something from Amazon. They can range from 10 bucks to hundereds. Also, if all else fails you can make something home made like a gravity bong, Apple pipe or something like that. Be warned, smoking out of cans and what not is really not that healthy. You can look up videos on how to pack a bowl, it's really straightforward though, grind the weed and put it in the bowl, and light it. also, if you have any toker friends, they probably have multiple pipes and you could possibly borrow one. again, if youre unsure how to use it, look up videos. Good luck :)"
saplings,3aflah,WeedThreeKings,2,Fri Jun 19 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. I like pipes because I can hit them once or twice and put them out easier than a joint. Plus, rolling sucks."

saplings,3ah47x,zuko_for_firelord,3,Sat Jun 20 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend putting water in the percs. Take the downstem out and pour water straight through the mouthpiece. It won't cover the holes in the percs all the way, but that's okay, some water will pull through when you hit it.  Also, since I see an ice catcher, I recommend putting cold water in the base, warm water in the percs, and a few ice cubes. Makes for a nice, smooth hit :)"
saplings,3ah47x,Hoch,2,Sat Jun 20 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"This guy knows what he's talking about, OP. I'd recommend putting hot water in the base of the bong, and cold water in the percs. The hot water will condense the smoke letting you have a bigger hit, while the cold water has the dual job of cooling the smoke while slowing the melting of the ice."
saplings,3ah47x,PunkAintDead,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:28:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience, you get a smoother hit with the warm water in the percs, as it adds a bit of moisture to the smoke. The cold water immediately followed by the ice will likely pull moisture from the smoke."

For this reason alone, a bong would be impractical for me. I'd love to have one.

Don't have a need for a dry pipe. I've got a desktop vape which is certainly very nice, but honestly I don't get why so many people swear vaping is so much better. ( i get the health reasons, i mean enjoyment) Don't get me wrong, i get how its different, and boy oh boy do I enjoy it, just don't see why it has such a fanbase vs smoking.  My bong, the mental combustion engine, is by far my favorite. Interesting glass, packs a hell of a punch, and about as smooth as I can seem to get it, though with that quantity of smoke you're gonna feel somethin'. Personally I love loading up small bowls in it and clearing them in one shot, feel like i get all of everything thats burned.  P.S. If ever I can't decide, plug the desktop vape into the bong, a bit unwieldy, but you dont even feel the vapor enter your lungs. You definitely feel it leave, dont know any way around that."

saplings,3ad80d,CampbellH,2,Fri Jun 19 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"I have been smoking forever and I like a not too big bong with a slide out bowl and a neck that will hold my lighter without it sliding down into the water. Those giant bongs just give huge harsh hits that leave you coughing. Don't be seduced by giant expensive bongs. A nice foot (or slightly more) tall bong with a fluted mouthpiece is all you need. We even use a piece of stretchy string to make a leash for our lighter, so it stays inside the bong, easy to reach, but even easier because it has a leash attached, lighter. Never have to look for the lighter."

The first one costs about 70$, the second one I got for free but is about 30$ or something.  They both hit nice, but besides for visual stimulation, I wouldn't say that the fancy bong hits way better than the simple one. If I were to spend your budget on a bong, I'd just look for something I could put around my house as a piece or art or decoration."
saplings,3ad80d,spoetnick,2,Fri Jun 19 12:11:26 2015 UTC,first of all go to your local headshop. get a pull carb not a thumb carb trust me. other than that just go for the coolest design that you like if it has cool add-ons thats neat but a bong is a bong try to get thick glass its more durable usually. if you can remove the stem then its replaceable and you can take it out for cleaning but the replaceable part is nice. i cannot stress this enough though Pull carb > thumb carb by far.

Milk is a fat, and THC is fat soluble. The mix will work, definitely, but you'll be leaving some of the product behind as a light film on the edge of your glass and in little dribbles at the bottom when you're finished. This will result in (unless you can find a way to assure you get every drop) a slightly diminished high (because you wont be getting as much.)  very small change from the original product, but since your question was ""will i get just as high"" the answer is close, but not quite... and some people are very particular in getting every little bit out of their product."

saplings,3a9928,D1STURBED36,2,Thu Jun 18 07:43:14 2015 UTC,As others said just grind and go if you get an herbal vaporizer. Some only work with oil they tend to be called vape pens. If you have the money the pax and pax 2 are absolutely amazing. If you want a cheaper option the Mflb or flowermate is okay. The atmos orbit isn't bad either just heats a little to much and has a short battery.
saplings,3a9928,ld436,2,Thu Jun 18 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"Research, research, and more research. I started looking into getting a vaporizer months ago and I just decided on the one I'm going to get. You have to look at stealth, heating efficiency, trench size, battery-life, portability, quality of manufacturing, and taste, and all of those things depend on your preferences.   I finally decided on getting the DaVinci ""Ascent"", which is regarded by many as the best portable vaporizer on the market today. The only downside is that it has a glass mouthpiece and glass vapor path, but, as long as you are careful, they shouldn't break. It comes with an extra of each besides. You may want to look into it, but if you want a more ""beginner"" route, you may want to consider the Magic Flight Launch Box instead. There is quite a bit of a learning curve to get used to using it without combusting the herb and for getting good hits, but it's price is very cheap for a vaporizer, it's very small and discreet, and it has an unlimited lifetime warranty.  With vaporizers, all you have to do is grind up your herb and pack it lightly into the trench. No decarboxylating required. In fact, vaporizing your herb decarboxylates it for you, so after you are done vaping your trench you could use it (the ""duff"") for edibles, which makes vaporizing incredibly cost-effective and efficient. Some vaporizers require different levels of how finely you grind your herb, so be sure to research.  If you aren't going to be bringing your vaporizer around with you, you may want to consider getting a ""desktop"" vaporizer instead. I don't know as much about desktop vaporizers as I do about portable vaporizers, but desktop models usually produce a lot of vapor at a time, making them ideal for groups or people who require more because of their tolerance. The ""Volcano"" is still regarded as the best desktop model you could possibly get, as long as you can handle the price.  Now, just so you know, vaporizers will smell. Heating marijuana at any time will nearly always produce a smell of some sort. But the good thing about a vaporizer's smell is that the scent is significantly less detectable than smoking is, and the scent is also more of an ""overdone popcorn"" smell rather than ""pot smoke"" smell. Also, since it is vapor, the smell will dissipate much faster than smoke would. As long as you have somewhat decent ventilation going on, no one would know you are vaping, and even if someone did smell your vaping smell, they would have to be well-versed in the ways of getting high to actually recognize the smell, and that kind of person certainly wouldn't care, lol  To give you a good example of how little vaporizers smell: I used to own a disposable e-cigarette filled with hash oil that I had gotten from my dealer. I used a puff or two while I was in the shower, and then got into my pajamas to watch TV with my girlfriend on the couch. At one point while watching, I took another big hit from my e-cig, held it for a few seconds, and then exhaled normally. My girlfriend didn't smell a thing. I even asked her after exhaling if she smelled anything, and she was wondering what I was talking about, lol. And the exhaled vapor tasted and smelled like spicy herbs rather than like marijuana.   If you have any specific questions, please feel free to send me a message. I've been researching marijuana for a very long time, and I research just about everything for whatever topic I find."

Are you in a place where you need something small or is it okay to have one that can be seen?   Are you vaping bud or oil? If bud, there are pens that work with that or the Magic Flight Launch Box.   When you've decided that, look up vapes within different price ranges. And just check reviews.   You really can't make a wrong choice if you just do those things. The biggest things are does it fit your need for discreetness, reviews good, and does it get you high?"

They are made from several different processes that extract the THC. The one in the OP is the Butane Hash Oil process.    There are special ""rigs"" used specifically for dabbing. There are various styles of ""bowls"" but basically all of them require you to heat the ""bowl"" with a torch until it's red hot.   You should already have some extract on the end of a metal ""dabber"" and place it on the red hot surface. Obviously inhale.  Alternately, you can place some of it on your flowers and smoke it as you normally would. This will make you weed burn much much slower. And it'll increase it's potency tenfold."

saplings,3a2izs,Th3m4ni4c,7,Wed Jun 17 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"Just to add to the other answers, this substance is called a concentrate, or sometimes hash oil, or wax.   A ""dab"" is the small amount you vaporize and inhale. It's analogous to a ""hit"" of marijuana. You wouldn't say that you ""bought some dabs today"". You would say, ""I bought some wax and we're going to take dabs of it""."
saplings,3a2izs,Bigfrostynugs,2,Sun Jun 21 02:56:28 2015 UTC,"""Dabs"" refers to a number of different forms of highly-concentrated, highly-condensed forms of THC that have been reduced to a waxy, tarry, oily, buttery, or even brittle-solid state, depending on the process used. Many dab concentrates are sticky, yet otherwise hard until you play with them a little bit; the ambient heat from your hands is sufficient enough to make the concentrate soften slightly, which makes it easier to handle.  I have only just recently started recreationally researching dabs in general, but dabs are more or less made by ""washing"" high-potency buds or hash with a chemical solvent. Butane is commonly used, although some other chemicals (carbon-dioxide, if I remember correctly?) can be used as well. The solvent will strip away and absorb the cannabinoids from the plant-matter until you are left with a yellowish colored liquid (as shown in the link of this post). This liquid is then heated up in a precise way until the solvent is completely removed, and what you have left is your concentrate, your ""dabs"".   To use dabs, you smoke them, but you need a bong-like device specifically equipped with a specially shaped metal bowl, a metal or glass poker, and a blow-torch (or electronic bowl-heater) to smoke it properly. To start, separate a small piece of your concentrate from the larger portion and set it aside. Next, take your poker and gently press the tip of it onto the piece of the concentrate (or scoop it [it depends on the form of the concentrate]) until it is adequately stuck on the end of the poker, enough to where it won't fall off easily. Now, activate your blow-torch (or, if you have an electronic bowl-heater, turn this on first to let it ""preheat"") and angle the flame onto the metal bowl until it is quite hot. You don't necessarily need the bowl to be glowing or anything, but you do need to be sure that the bowl is high in temperature, high enough to where it would burn you if you touched it. Now, take your poker with the concentrate on the end of it, and gently press the concentrate all over the inside walls of the bowl while inhaling. I'm sure it's possible to only use a portion of your poker at a time, but it's probably easier to simply use a small enough piece that you can inhale the whole thing in a single hit. Continue pressing the tip of the poker from all angles on the inside walls of the bowl until you are sure that the entire piece of concentrate has been burned and inhaled.  Since dabs are literally concentrated globs of THC, the effects are going to be significantly stronger than the kinds you would get from smoking or vaporizing alone. For an anecdotal description, I asked my friend about it and he said ""Dabs are super strong, like imagine the first time you got really high x10"". That's just one example, but it does give you a glimpse as to what dabs can be like.  If you are considering making your own concentrates at home, do not do so until you are heavily-versed in the subject, and also possess the correct equipment to do so. Making your own concentrates is entirely possible, but it can be a very dangerous process (butane is flammable, you can't breathe carbon-dioxide, unsupervised heat can become difficult to contain, etc., get the picture?). Depending on where you live, it is certainly easier to purchase concentrates than it is to make them on your own, especially since you usually require large amounts of very potent weed to yield a concentrate that can even be considered respectable."
saplings,3a2izs,Afrew,2,Wed Jun 17 00:25:02 2015 UTC,I'll ask you since you seem well-versed. Are concentrates like this regulated in the same way as plant matter? Are they legal in the four states + DC?
saplings,3a2izs,wz_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, yes, at least in the areas along the west-coast. I've seen many Youtube videos of various weed-reviewers opening or utilizing packets of concentrates, and the packets themselves look very high-quality and mass-produced, indicating that they are available on retail. Couple that with the fact that there are so many different types of concentrates which vary in potency, and it's easy to see how a company would be mass-producing them to be open in the market. It would be exceedingly difficult to have such high-quality, high-visibility concentrates be available without having a large manufacturing system behind it."
saplings,3a2izs,Afrew,2,Wed Jun 17 02:00:43 2015 UTC,"Here in California, concentrates are legal and available in dispensaries in the commercially packaged and mass-produced formats you mention. The process of producing them is still in a legal gray area in most parts of the state, though, so you hear about some of the larger labs being shut down every so often."
saplings,3a2izs,DIARY_OF_A_TRAP_GOD,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Dabs are various types of cannabis oils that have been processed to collect together and form high concentrated doses, hence the name ""concentrates"". They hit much harder and faster than regular plant matter and are good for people with a high tolerance."
saplings,3a2izs,RandomGuyinACorner,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:46:39 2015 UTC,"Youtube shows all sorts of methods for making these.   One you can try very easily at home, with little equipment is to heat up a lady friends hair straightener, put a small piece of weed in some parchment paper (also referred to as grease proof paper) fold the paper once, with the piece of weed in the newly created fold seam.   After the straightener is nice and hot, squeeze it down on the parch paper wrapped weed for a 3 count.   When you release, you should have a tiny ""dab"" that you can scrape of the paper easily, and smoke however you see fit.   You can ""squeeze"" the same piece a few times I think.   Doesn't take much weed, and is a nice way to sample a dab with stuff you may have laying around the house."
saplings,3a2izs,Brother_Clovis,-2,Tue Jun 16 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"That's not a dab, that's a rudimentary form of hash, especially since hash is just a big mass of trichomes that have been heated up and compressed. The hair straightener method still includes all of the original plant-matter, which is not what a dab (or more specifically ""concentrate"") is since a concentrate is nothing but concentrated cannabinoids, hence ""concentrate"".   I corrected myself, people. Please read further down, rather than just a single comment."
saplings,3a2izs,Afrew,3,Tue Jun 16 22:14:08 2015 UTC,"No, you're not getting me.   When you do the press, a clear yellowish concentrate can be scraped off the paper.   I'm not talking about just flattened weed.   I put the dab in quotations because it's technically probably not a true dab, but it is a concentrate.    It's also referred to as a ""rosin dab"".   EDIT:  here's one of dozens of examples on YouTube.     https://youtu.be/RYLdA2-P_Bw"
saplings,3a2izs,Brother_Clovis,2,Tue Jun 16 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"Fascinating! Excellent link!  Do you figure that this same process could be efficient if you use kief instead of raw nugs? Also, how would you collect all of the tiny splotches of concentrate into a larger, central piece, like the one shown in the beginning of the video?"
saplings,3a2izs,Afrew,2,Tue Jun 16 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"Kief definitely works, but I haven't tried it myself.   My understanding is that it kindof separates itself from the THC, so your left with a crumbly Bi product that's prob still good for cooking with, or eating in some form.   You can use a dab tool (almost looks like an ear wax scraper coincidentally.) To pick the rosin off the paper,  or like the guy in the vid, a razer blade.   Once you have enough gathered,  just roll it up with your fingers, and the heat from your hand should make it bind together.   Put it in another piece of parchment, and squeeze it together, and flatten it out with something.   Rolling a can, or something cylindrical (think of a bakers rolling pin) over the parch wrapped rosin should flatten it out like is seen in the vid,  or even a quick squeeze with the hair dryer on a low setting."

saplings,3a4kwz,saplingsthrowaway123,2,Wed Jun 17 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"A big factor with how long THC will appear in the urine (which is what I assume you are asking about) is how frequently you get high. Generally, the potency of the marijuana and how much you used in a single session doesn't really have much to do with it, at least not nearly as much as how often you get high.   I am about the same body type as you are. I generally smoke once every 2 or 3 weeks. With that said, if I wasn't exercising and staying hydrated, the THC would pass in probably a week, if that. If you are a more frequent user (let's say 2 or 3 times per week) THC may be present in urine for almost 2 weeks. With heavier users (getting high everyday, maybe even multiple times per day) THC will be detectable in urine for at least a month, sometimes upwards of three months, but those cases are rather rare. Those are all pretty close to what the maximum amount of times would be, but they give you a pretty good idea.  There are several more variables that affect THC retention such as body fat, rate of metabolism, activity levels, and hydration. For people like us (tall, lean, fast metabolism) we more or less don't have to worry about drug tests at all. For people who have higher percentages of body fat, THC is easily bonded with fat cells, meaning that bigger people are probably going to have longer THC retention. Studies also show that exercises that strengthen cardiovascular endurance can significantly increase the rate in which the body expels detectable amounts of THC (8 hours of cardio total per week can increase THC expulsion by almost 50%); sedentary lifestyle = longer period to detect THC, active lifestyle = shorter period to detect THC.  To answer your question specifically, I'm sure we'd be looking at less than a week for your body to no longer show any detectable amounts of THC. If you are unsure, you can purchase drug tests at just about any pharmacy store (like Walgreen's, CVS, etc.) and test your own urine yourself. The tests you can buy at the store are the same quality that you would have to use elsewhere."

Buying online is also partly out of the question because in most cases, you'll need a credit card, which I suspect you don't have. Just find someone old enough who's willing to buy you a bong either online or from a head shop. Expect to pay around $30-50 for a standard cheap piece and $100+ for a more expensive piece.

saplings,3a3c7d,beantownclimber,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:07:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if you're still living with your parents, a bong might not be great because they tend to not be as inconspicuous as a pipe.  Make sure you clean the water regularly or else it'll start to smell.  When I purchased my first bong I spent 80 or 90 bucks on it.  It came with a slide and bowl.  I think for the most part, shelling out a little more tends to yield better results.  Yes, there are doable pieces in the $50 range, but they tend to have thin glass or are manufactured in China (yay lead paint!).  There definitely is a point of rapidly diminishing returns when it comes to penny pinching for pieces.  As far as what you need on a starter bong goes, you should keep it simple.  I lucked out and got an ice catcher on my first one.  An ice catcher is a couple of nubs that stick out from the interior walls of the neck of the bong such that it would stop ice from falling all the way down to the water but still allows air to flow through.  It's a really nice feature that makes smoking much smoother and usually doesn't add too much to the overall price.  It isn't necessary though, so feel free to pick a slightly cheaper piece without one.  I would research around and read some reviews for head shops in your area first.  In the Boston area, prices swing wildly shop to shop, so feel free to shop around.  Don't settle for the first piece you see, there might be a way better deal on the same (or similar) piece at a different store.  Additionally, some shops ""barter"" with you if you ask for a markdown, but usually what that means is they already have the piece marked up and are marking it down to seem like they're doing you a big favor.  Now once you get there and think you've found ""the one"", don't go purchasing it just yet.  Take the time to examine the glass thoroughly under light.  Look for any signs of cracks or damage to the piece.  Remember, once you buy it you're stuck with it (especially if you've smoked out of it).  If it comes with a downstem and bowl, pull them out and inspect them as well.  Does the piece feel too light?  Extremely flimsy?  Too thin?  Remember that your bowl should be made of thick glass too so that you don't burn yourself on it (or at the very least have a small handle or knob so you don't have to touch the bowl directly).  The other thing I've been told by head shops is to not buy black glass.  Why?  It's more expensive than clear or other colored glasses.  Therefore, blowers have a tendency to blow it thinner than other glass.  Once you've found the one, congrats!  You are now the proud owner of a bong.  Feel free to PM me or reply to this comment if you need me to clarify anything.  Godspeed!  P.S.  If you're worried about being on the DL and don't want to keep glass around, there are always alternatives like the Water Puff that allow you to continue using plastic bottles.  It's super easy and just screws on to the top of any bottle."

saplings,39y891,lotrislove,4,Mon Jun 15 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion... Outdoor is nice, it allows the smoke to drift away and it doesnt hurt to enjoy a little nature with your high. Indoors will allow for privacy and even in legal states you cant smoke ""publicly"" Both are going to be more of a ""Head High"" because of them being Sativa. Lemon Haze is Lemony Herbalish... and Purple is kind of Earthy Berry tasting... When smoking Sativas music is a great way to enjoy your high. For me , i hear things differently... its as if i can pick apart each instrument and i can hear each individual musical note much more clearly. Sometimes just chatting can be really fun. One time i started talking about feeling like i was in Japan... and the conversation took off from there... good laughs were had. Just try to enjoy it by being as laid back as possible.  The time it takes ""to get high"" and ""stay high"" varies... sometimes you may not even know you are high your first time. Usually for me i know its starting to kick in when i feel my upper cheeks start to pull up into a smile. lol... So id say if you are taking some light rips and are passing around small piece you would start to feel something definitely around 10 mins... Its really depends on how much you smoke and how your body reacts to it when wondering how long a high lasts. You can start coming down and feel ""normal"" after like 45 mins, but trust me you arent lol...  But yeah, 3 hours is a LONG time to be high. He may be trying to smoke you out lol But alot of times Saplings dont smoke ""to their potential"", meaning that the hits you take arent very full. I smoked alone my first time and i didnt realize how little smoke i was actually inhaling until i smoke with someone much more experienced. Go for the white smoke then inhale. Others will know what i mean and i think your friend will. Anyway, this was just my opinion and my two cents...  OH and dont forget to make sure to eat before hand, have your favorite snack with you and cold refreshing drink (dry mouth is pretty common), bring your eye drops lol (not sure if you are trying to hide it from parents or other friends), and most of all if you do end up getting pretty high DONT WORRY... it will pass and you will come back down and be perfectly fine after. Im sure your friend will support you but just remember that if you start to freak out that everything will be all good in a little bit."

It looks like a hybrid strain you've got there. Remember to give it the right amount of nutrients it needs. I've personally used Bio-Grow in the growth stages (first 2-3 weeks) then when it starts flowering used this. Also look in to ""topping"" as it'll increase yield. As far as I know the standard light cycle is 18 hours of light in the vegetative stage and 12 hours of light in flowering stage up until harvest."

saplings,39wvag,TheOneTrueGod69,2,Mon Jun 15 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yea dude, vaping gives you a way higher percentage of the THC that doesn't get incinerated by fire. With traditional smoking you basically just get whatever makes it through."
saplings,39wvag,imnotrelevanttothis,2,Mon Jun 15 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"Already, you have to consider you're a daily vaper, and since vaping brings a lot more actual THC into your body than joints/blunts, which bring tar and other bad stuff into your system, your tolerance might be rather high.  Also, you're saying ""pure j"", which might mean you're used to smoking spliffs. If such is the case, your tolerance, which at this moment is defined by the pure j, the blunt, and the daily vaping, is at a record high, and unless you don't smoke a hell lot more, you won't fly anywhere anytime soon.   To answer your doubt, you've simply smoked too much in the immediate past and your tolerance is currently very high. My advice would be to either double your doses (which would obviously be unwise as it could get expensive and your tolerance would double as well), or maybe to take a break, a week or two without any toking, and then seeing how that turns out."
saplings,39veky,Fallicies,8,Mon Jun 15 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"Since it has been a while since you smoked, start out sloooow, as if you're a newbie. Personally, I'd toke alone for a couple times, making sure the setting is just right, with some good, calming music and no risk of getting caught. Take a hit, wait a few. If you're good, take another hit, and wait. Don't take it too fast. Go in with a clear mindset. If you start worrying about the anxiety, set the bowl down and find something to occupy your mind for a few minutes, then try again."

I'm one of the ones who doesn't look stoned, lol. One time, I smoked half of a bowl (and it's a pretty big bowl), and then had my girlfriend drove me though the drivethrough at a fast-food place. Once we got to the window, I noticed that one of my friends was working the drivethrough, so I started a conversation with him and we talked for a few minutes. After we got our food, as we were driving away, my girlfriend turns to me and goes ""Are you high?"", to which I reply ""Oh, oh yeah, I'm really stoned right now"", and she goes ""Wow, I honestly thought you were pretending before. You acted completely normal when you were talking to your friend"". Other times, even after my girlfriend knows I just came back inside after smoking, she still won't know I'm high unless I tell her so, lol  My friend, on the other hand, is such a doober when he's high. I picked him up to take him to the mall once, and his speech had a certain type of quality I recognized, and I suspected he was pretty high. And then when he took his sunglasses off, holy crap, his eyes were red and glassy as hell. When we're together, he'll take only a couple hits and then he's immediately bloodshot and goofy and squinty.  It honestly depends on the person. Some people can naturally hide it really well, some people can't hide it at all, and others can hide it if they try. It takes a little practice.  As for a legitimate tip though, I recommend putting in the eyedrops before you start smoking, or right after you start. I've heard that this prevents the bloodshot effect much better than if you've already been rolling for a couple hours."
saplings,39vsdf,newsweeden,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"Really it will depend on you and your parents. I have friends who can be completely blazed out of their minds and most people never catch on, but I also have friends who after just a single hit it becomes super obvious. But for most people as long as theyre not extremely high people dont really catch on. In my experience people who have used it before themselves are also better at picking out someone if theyre high, like if your parents were ever exposed to it growing up they'll probably be more likely to catch on than if they've been sheltered against it all their life. Personally my eyes don't get that red and my friends always tell me the only difference thy notice is I'm slightly more quite than while high, it's really only my friends who smoke themselves who can pick up on it without other hints besides my behavior. The first time I smoked I came home about an hour later (it felt much longer to me though) so I was still high and my parents didn't notice, I was afraid they would thougj cause I had a bad case of the munchies and ate a bunch of food I normally hate because it was more convenient. Minimizing the time you spend around your parents is probably a good idea but if you have to talk to or something just remember they have no reason to suspect you've been smoking if you don't give then a reason to, act natural and they'll respond naturally."

saplings,39unkh,jatgoodwin,2,Mon Jun 15 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"Judging from what you've just typed, you may want to consider getting the Magic Flight Launch Box, which is probably the best cheap-while-still-being-decent-to-good-quality vaporizer you can get. It's a bit over $100 bucks, but that is cheap for vaporizers. Plus vaporizers are very efficient, cost-effective, easy on the airways, and stealthy, so it really will pay for itself in no time. And they don't taste bad either. I have no idea where you are getting that from, because that is definitely one of the well-known advantages to using a vaporizer.  Now, vaporizers don't give you smoke and they don't have the same ""heavy"" feeling that smoking from a bong or pipe does, so if you and your friends are looking to blow clouds, vaporizers won't do that. Honestly, you will hardly know you are taking a hit at all, that's how light the vapor is sometimes. But if you are looking to get absolutely stoned from hardly any weed at all, a vaporizer is right up your alley. In fact, I'm ordering one very soon!  Also, don't go to /r/vaporents, which is the subreddit for users who vaporize their weed. They are seriously really judgmental and are condescending to people who don't own vaporizers. I asked a question there about the legality of ordering a vaporizer online (since my girlfriend was concerned), and they legitimately insulted me and my girlfriend for it. If you want unbiased information from someone who isn't an asshole for no reason, you can either reply to my comment or send me a message. I've done tons of research on this stuff in the past few months, and I am more than willing to help out :)"

saplings,39unkh,Afrew,2,Mon Jun 15 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, right, because every state and country in the world has legalized marijuana and marijuana accessories, right?"
saplings,39unkh,Infernoherpes,2,Mon Jun 15 17:20:30 2015 UTC,It's not a marijuana accessory though. They are sold as aromatherapy devices or tobacco vaporizers. Just because the majority of them are purchased for use with weed doesn't make it illegal. That's like saying buying hypodermic needles might be illegal because people use them to do heroin.
saplings,39unkh,Afrew,2,Mon Jun 15 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Right, the majority of them are purchased for weed though, which is why the question if legality is important.

saplings,39unkh,Infernoherpes,2,Mon Jun 15 17:29:49 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand how paraphernalia laws work. It's not paraphernalia until there is resin of a illegal substance. It doesn't matter why you're buying it they can't take it away without probable cause.

As long as you clean it right (91%+ iso alcohol, epsom salt, lots of shaking), you can make it hit like it's brand new.  Do you put water in the tree (top) perc? If not, do so. I recommend the following setup: Cold water in the base, warm water in the tree perc, then a couple ice cubes in the ice catch. Doing that with my bong makes the smoothest hits I've ever had."

saplings,39ut8b,jedo144,6,Sun Jun 14 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"As much as it sucks, throw that entire batch away. Mold is something you do not want to mess with. Even the parts that don't look or smell moldy still more than probably have numerous mold spores all over them, which means that those portions are already contaminated.  The pictures are too low-quality to tell, but, just based on what you have typed, your weed is definitely ""rotten"", or at least pretty close to it, or at least way too risky to try and find out, especially if it's white and yellow. Toss that shit, and give your dealer some hell, because, if it's only been 2 - 3 weeks, that shit was already pretty damn old. Any dealer who's worth his salt will always keep their product properly stored and fresh.  Invest in a proper jar, not this ""baggie"" business. Baggies aren't good for shit, but a true jar (""Bell"" brand is the tops [they've been around for basically a century for a reason]) will prevent airflow, which is the quickest thing that ""kills"" weed. I finally finished my last batch, and I had it for probably half of a year without any issues in freshness whatsoever. Really any airtight container will do. My ""fun box"" is a Tupperware/Rubbermaid container that seals up perfectly. In the container is a couple grams, and then inside a jar inside the container is another couple grams.  Don't mess around with your lungs, dude. Getting high is not worth a trip to the hospital and potentially losing your life because of some sort of bronchial infection or disease."

You couldn't even extract THC as it has none. You could use it as kindling to start a fire or grill. That's about it.  Basically, you have what I would call pre-trim. It's the trim I would do before I hang my plants up to dry - stems direct from the plant's main stem and large fan leaves and some small if they're hanging out. These parts have zero trichomes = zero THC. Then, I would hang the plants up to dry. Some people trim the buds all the way while still wet. I prefer that halfway mark, leaving them still on the stem to hang up.   Edit: I hate when I get rated down for being correct when everyone else is cleary uneducated and inexperienced, regurgitating bullshit. Just because it's trim doesn't mean you'll get shit from it. I can see the trim comes a low quality plant. If the plant was higher quality/better grown, you'd see it!

saplings,39s21g,anthonytaurus,2,Sun Jun 14 16:13:18 2015 UTC,Thc isnt just on the outside of the plant. Its also on the inside. Along with a host of other cannabinoids. All of which can still be extracted.
saplings,39s21g,Patrichh,-7,Sun Jun 14 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. The amount of cannibinoids existing within the plant matter itself is so minute that it doesn't even make sense to consider using it to get high. The human body creates more cannibinoids on its own than you could find in plant matter itself. If plant matter held ANY value whatsoever, you would need to grind it to dust. This is why NO ONE does it.   Which is why it's beyond me as to why you would advocate for someone else to do it.   You're nitpicking. You're begging to be right. You're grasping at straws. It's pathetic.   If the OP had a better quality of trim, then we could talk about doing more with it. Yes, everyone woud be right. I wouldnt be wrong because I wouldn't need to comment to correct WRONG advice b/c there wouldn't be wrong advice to correct.   However, the reality is the quality of trim is low. So, it serves no purpose to do anything other than dump it. Perhaps, kindling or compost.   Now, how are you gonna fight to be right when you're clearly wrong? I don't care to see it but it woukd be amazing if you posed as a grown up right now instead of someone who thinks they know about marijuana."
saplings,39s21g,DrQuaid,3,Sun Jun 14 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"what? lol. I guarantee you, there is at least 5-8% thc left in there... If the stems haven't been blasted/vaporized/cooked with/Alcohol washed they are practically 1/10th THC. Sugar leaves usually have a lot of trichomes, but these look like water leaves. They have cannibinoids, but don't carry a lot of thc, but it's gonna be over 5% which isn't great but it's still yield. You might get a gram of wax, that isn't hella potent, but it'll be worth it.    And I actually research into things i'm interested in, and I have gained knowledge of marijuana. I'm going to school to grow it.   Yes, he isn't going to get super fire top shelf dankity dank wax, but he could get high from this. That was his question. Not ""can I sell this to Cookies 415 for $90 a gram?""..."

After zooming in, I can see the lollipop sticks but not the candy, so to speak.  One, the candy comes off in different ways. One main way, it rubs off, breaks off, you get that dust in the bag. The other main way is the grower or a middle man screens the buds meaning he rubs them over a screen to get the outer trichomes to fall off, make hash. It's like skimming off the top. He only skims maybe <1% of the total THC.  Two, because it's such a common thing to get buds like that, it's better to crack open the bud to see how dense the field of trichomes are on the inside. Those won't fall off during a screening."

Do it enough times, you'll get an eye for it. If not, it just might not be a well grown bud.   Also, it could come from the lower tier of the plant where it gets less light so the buds are kinda malnourished. Those are usually a dull, dark green color. That's why growers usually prune the lower canopy of the plant. Saves plant energy for the top and making those FAT, dense, sugary colas.  And, this is why, as buyers, we like BIG buds and not those little ones. Big buds come from the top, all the light and auxins and nourishment. Big buds aren't broken down and even if they got screened, you got all that goodness that can't get screened."

saplings,39r6r5,Ressotami,2,Sun Jun 14 00:21:13 2015 UTC,I'll try to find the source but there were some people from the medical field that said that people who regularly smoke cannabis have heart palpitations which is irregular heart beat but they also went on to say that it had no negative impact on the user. Your heart rate usually shoots up when you start your session but after about 10 minutes it usually goes back to normal (tested this with my friends health watch and app).   As for the nauseousness there is rare possibility that you're swallowing smoke. Everyone is different but most people that I know (including me) smoke or vape weed to get rid of feeling nauseous lol.     Edit i'm sick and kinda groggy/ didn't feel like reading through the medical studies I dug up to back up what i've read but there are many people who smoke constantly that get their general physical and are just fine.

Don't push it on him tho. Bring a joint and say something like how since it's your birthday, i rolled this joint for us if you're down to try it. Make sure you're in a chill environment, make sure he has water and stuff, treat him nice.

We did it in a parking lot of a school. Just as long as you do it in a secluded, more private place, you're good. On the other hand, the car danked baaad for a week, but that was with constant spraying of febreeze and lighting candles in the car and keeping the windows open (the smell seeped through the air filters too).   It's up to you but there really isn't even a benefit to doing so. Whatever you do, be safe, don't be stupid, and make good decisions!"
saplings,39qkze,yddec,3,Sat Jun 13 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"If you do decide to hotbox your car, be sure to close any of your air vents so smoke doesn't get inside and make the car smell whenever you turn on the heater/AC.

saplings,39qkze,TripleNubz,2,Sat Jun 13 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"Ok your getting bad advice here.   An hr with the windows open, leather is better than cloth, don't wipe hash or resin on seats. If you hot box a blunt expect more smell but its tobacco not pot. Tobacco smoke sticks around much easier than pot smoke. Ozium is your friend. Don't breath when using it. Someplace that you don't stand out like a car for of idiots hot boxing, keys in ignition equal DWI Are you doing this alone? Half the fun with hot boxing is everyone passing around different things and not being able to see then clearly.    I really think your thinking about this way to much. Its just weed"
saplings,39qkze,Hexavxozy,2,Sun Jun 14 05:05:32 2015 UTC,"I would advice against doing this. 1. The smell will probably always linger but after driving around with the windows down for a while it will go away for the most part. 2. In your garage? Any place that is private. There really aren't a lot of places around where i live where hot boxing would be practical except behind a building in an apartment complex type thing. 3. I haven't hot boxed too much but when i have it wasn't that great. It's called a hot box for a reason, it gets really hot. But I'm pretty sure the reason people get ""higher"" is because from all the smoking, you're burning up all the oxygen in the car and you start to deprive yourself from oxygen. I've hot boxed on the move and that's really stupid. Please don't do this ever. And if you do decide to hotbox, take it easy."
saplings,39qkze,sound_coffin,3,Sat Jun 13 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"You won't deprive yourself of oxygen if you hotbox, especially in a car. Maybe if you hotbox a elevator with like 20 blunts going at once, but only maybe. There's wayyy too much oxygen in a car to be deprived."

saplings,39r5v4,RandomGuyinACorner,3,Sun Jun 14 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"Kind of. It's still strain dependent for certain effects. Most people don't vape past 400+F but actually a lot of the heavy chock locky oils have a vaporization temperature from 390-445F (combustion is around 450F but depending on how dry your material is it could be more or less by up to 5 degrees). Smokers usually are used to this heavy feeling and so when they switch to vaping most start around the medium temps which don't give you those heavy feelings. Vaping around 330-360F gives you more of just the thc without those other oils so people get happy and more of an ""uplifted"" feeling without getting as tired.   TLDR: light temps for clear high, heavy temps for closer to a traditional heavy high.   This chart is not the one chart to rule them all. Many factors in your material change the temperature of release for these oils but it gives you a good estimate.   http://www.weedist.com/2012/07/tailoring-high-compounds-in-cannabis-properties-boiling-points/"

saplings,39mnzn,StoppedLurking_ZoeQ,5,Fri Jun 12 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"Best advice. I would even take it 1 step further. Load up a bowl, make them breathe the entire hit in but half way through get them to breathe fresh air, then finish the hit, then breathe fresh air (doing it with the carb might confuse them if they arn't breathing right. By breathing in the fresh air it will force them to at least push the hits into there lungs.  They will cough like they never knew but they will also get really high. If they are able to hold it down (if they do this probably not) then at least go for 2 seconds. This will completely eliminate them not inhaling it correctly, if there still not high it might be the rumors off ""thc doesn't correctly activate the first few time (which I don't really believe)""."

I know a lot of people want to drink tons of water and then exercise to get cannabis out of their system, but you may be setting yourself up for a very dangerous scenario possibly causing death."
saplings,39odca,undercovergoddess,2,Sat Jun 13 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"Water intoxication:       Water intoxication, also known as water poisoning or dilutional hyponatremia, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside safe limits by overhydration.  Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or from long bouts of exercise during which excessive amounts of fluid were consumed.  Moreover, water cure, a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive amounts of water, can cause water intoxication.  Water, just like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-consumed in a specific period of time. Water intoxication mostly occurs when water is being consumed in a high quantity without giving the body the proper nutrients it needs to be healthy, but even healthy people can get water intoxication.

I was using it to escape my life, I was bored without it, counted the hours until I could do it again. This was only because it made me happy and my reality of daily life was shit. It wasn't some dangerous drug, I just wanted to be happy and there you go, there was a solution that made me happy.   Before weed it was alcohol < video games < friends <hobbies < being a kid who mindlessly happy naturally. I realised that I was just going down a shitty pattern. I was happy as a kid, the more I grew up the more miserable life became and I just wanted to be happy again. Going through everything it was weed that let me achieve that happiness again.  Now why am I saying don't worry after posting all that? Well it was only because of weed I began to understand it. Yes at first I was just enjoying being stoned and happy. Next instead of thinking about stupid things like how the pattern on my pet's fur is mesmerizing I started to look inner ( and yes this sounds just as goofy and hippy to me as it did before I started smoking and yet it happened).  Thanks to weed I actually cut out all the bullshit and re prioritized my life, it helped me break a destructive cycle. Made me realising it was trying to get happiness from distractions and how even though it's nice I should aim for what I consider important.  So what I'm getting at, in my experience It helped me out. Made me happy when I needed it, put me in a different state of mind that let me think about my life. Gave me motivation to change and was at the end of the day a harmless drug.  What I believe is if you want to be happy, it will probably either make you happy or show you the way. If you juts want to get fucked up it can do that for you. There isn't really anything wrong with becoming a daily smoker, it looks bad but it's not the same as alcohol. People who have caffeine every morning aren't looked down on. Alcohol is because it's pretty nasty for you body and generally you can't function, it also doesn't make you that happy, just blocks out and numbs.  You can function pretty well on weed, if you don't want to become I daily smoker (I though I did) then you probably wont. Like I said It helped me do the exact opposite of what I wanted. You also build up a natural tollerence so you don't need to worry about taking it too far.  Smoke too much? Well now your tolerance is too high and you can't physically get that high again (until you stop smoking for a while). That way you are forced to sober up, sober you might end up with a new perspective which means if you are stuck in a rut you can break the cycle quite easily.  Conclusion (didn't expect it to go on this long)/ TLDR:  The worst that can happen is that you like it, become happy and live happy days. The best that can happen is you find something fun to do that's harmless and fun. I wouldn't worry about it, it's so non addictive it's relatively easy to give up, when push comes to shove you can drop it in a heart beat. It's nothing compared to other drugs."

Usually I smoke about once or twice a week which is only on the weekends. It is my relief and reward after a hard week. Smoking with friends is fun but for me it often involves worrying about getting home and the atmosphere being chill, being with the right people etc. At home I can make the evening the way I want to, without having to worry about anything at all.   I can totally understand your fear about becoming dependent on weed, but in my opinion the danger with weed is that it will mess up your priorities. As long as you remind yourself what is important in life and don't neglect your school/career, you should be fine."

But I've smoked them all and they were all kosher, plus I got them from dealers who have better things to do than spend their time lacing weed for no reason.  The only time you really need to be worried about any particular batch is if the smell is something not natural, like a metallic, plastic, or chemical smell. Also be sure to inspect your nugs just to be sure they look okay."

If you are a lightweight, and particularly if you are inexperienced, some highs can be insanely intense.  I've heard of saplings smoking for their first or second time, and still feeling slightly high or groggy the next day. I've also noticed that most people experience a really intense, bad high if they take a huge rip they are not prepared for.  Coughing fits can suck on their own, but I also think they can make the high hit harder, and faster.   My first time taking Dabs,  I wasn't ready, and got higher than most times I took LSD."

saplings,39jdtl,gabethebabe2,4,Fri Jun 12 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"If I may expound further on the gentleman harmaway's comments... THC is stored in the fat cells of the body. The products they sell in stores are totally useless on pot. They are only good for cleaning out hard drugs from the system which are metabolized through the blood, liver, kidneys and expelled through urine. THC on the other hand is stored in the fat cells and is burned off as the body burns through its fat stores. A typical person will take around 30 days to burn through the fat supply and regenerate new ones. A heavier person will take longer. A person with practically no body fat will burn through it rapidly, which sounds like your case. And by rapidly I mean a week to two weeks.  Drinking water is a very good thing as it will help you metabolize fat, but it does not flush the system like you were thinking. Exercise is for sure the answer as it causes the body to use up its stored energy.  As to your main issues.... which are ADHD and parents. One try to have a real talk with them about what pot really is. Try to prepare yourself with educational materials first so you have reference points. The Emperor Wears No Clothes is a good start. Educate them that pot was only made illegal on the recreational side so that it would be made illegal on the industrial side as well. For decades the population was misinformed to deter hemp's use in industry and the ""reefer"" madness was a sham.  Also point out to them, that numerous states have recognized its medical qualities and have made it legal to possess for this reason. Your second issue, ADHD, is not one to over look. If the meds you were taking weren't working then talk to you doctor about changing them. And keep pushing him to change them until you find a combination that works for you. Typically it takes a month for the pills to work properly, so it will take time to get it right. And most importantly, change your diet. White or processed sugar are the real culprits regarding your condition. Do everything you can to avoid eating that and you will see a great change in your condition.  Eating healthier and cutting out sugar from your diet will lead to a drastic improvement in your condition.  Its not easy at first, but it becomes routine and you wont even notice it. And on the occasion you do try food with it, you will notice it doesnt taste very good.  Good luck, education and confidence and effort are the keys to your solution, not evasion and deceit.

It is illegal to possess it, grow it, transport it and sell it. But it is not illegal to be under the influence of it. So if your friend possesses it and you smoke it then you haven't broken the law. And thus would fail your parents' drug test in a lawful manor. So get really good at hiding it and your use of it, and you can justify a dirty test with consumption is legal. I prefer open honesty, it leads to a closer bond in the end. My father was against it too, and I had a sit down talk with him about it, and provided the proof he needed to see I was right, and what he was taught was wrong. If your father cannot see past logic for the failure of the laws, then your only remedy is to not ""possess"" it and just consume it, thereby satisfying your father's concerns."

If it's your parents and not a company (like the government) then it's probably going to be a cheap test anyway (like the amazon ones). You can try to chug water and cranberry juice BUT if it's a real test (like in a lab) you will fail for extreme dilution because that's usually a sign of people chugging water before a test haha. If it's a home kit then you have a higher chance of getting a pass with the dilution method.   All that said I think the best approach is like what these others guys is saying is to try to have a civilized talk about your condition and how the medication (cannabis) has been helping.   Just make sure you have counters to the following  -it's a drug (bring research to show how it helps you)  -We gave you money and you bought weed with it (if this is true then time to find another way to get money if that's their concern)  -I don't want weed smell (point to going outside or vaping though vaping does still smell to an extent)  I wish you luck.

This is especially true if I smoked sativa (makes me anxious in general, tho some friends feel the same way about indica).

Nowadays I can smoke 2 bowls and then go grocery shopping and be perfectly fine, back then it was two hits from a blunt and I was couch locked. Don't stress it, just take your smoking slowly like you did the second time around, you were just too blazed that other time."
saplings,39h7vb,EntBlossom,3,Thu Jun 11 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"I experience anxiety differently when I'm high, and it can be frightening because your mind is so overactive it might jump from point A to point D in your thinking process, making problems appear larger than life.  As others have said you more than likely just got way too high. The anxiety is something you learn to deal with or get used to over time."

Whenever I get like that, I just remind myself that it's only marijuana, and the effects will subside soon and just try and relax and enjoy it."

Best solution I found is to only smoke a bit, one or two medium sized tokes and I'm done. Being high isn't about how high you get, its about how enjoyable the high is."
saplings,39h7vb,pugger99,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:26:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I enjoy that effect a lot, yes, and I get there just about every time I get high (which is easier for me, since I only smoke once every week or two). When I get into that specific state of mind I tend to make lots of creative reasons for things, and it tends to be very enlightening and entertaining. In fact, a good buddy of mine I smoke with is more or less the same way, so we'll both get pretty stoned together and then just trip out on the couch.  Since you are still new to this, I would recommend taking it much slower until you have the experience and tolerance to really handle ""tripping"" when smoking. Take a hit, and then wait 10 minutes. If you feel like you want to be higher, take another hit, and then wait another 10 minutes to see how you feel. If after you wait for 10 minutes you decide, ""You know what, I'm high enough"", just chill and do the things you like for at least, I'd say 45 minutes before you consider taking another hit."

saplings,39hh9x,soxxfan105,3,Thu Jun 11 20:17:47 2015 UTC,Maybe try weaning yourself off of it (if you aren't under any time constraints). That might make it easier to take a t break in a couple weeks.
saplings,39hh9x,anthonytaurus,3,Thu Jun 11 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"Well, remember, marijuana is also medicine. Perhaps, your usage is controlling symptoms of a condition that you already have. However, you only recognize it when you stop using marijuana. I would keep a journal of what you're experiencing and be as specific as possible. Then, go speak to a doctor about it.   Perhaps, you're experiencing some digestive issues. Marijuana does alleviate various digestive ailments like Crohn's and IBS. If you noticed you're feeling really weird, maybe you're developing those issues and just don't realize it.   Force yourself off it for 30 days. 45 to 60 should be a enough if you're truly a heavy user. Then, see if it's really some kind of withdrawal or you're really in pain and need medical attention. If that is the case, you already know marijuana helps with your condition. Maybe, it's just a vitamin deficiency and you need to eat a banana once in a while. Find out for sure.   same to you /u/brandybelle"
saplings,39hh9x,anthonytaurus,2,Fri Jun 12 02:14:23 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best suggestion rule out any underlying medical issues. Next time i'm gonna try taking a blood sugar test cause I've noticed the nausea is similar to the nausea I get when my sugar drops too low, but usually a bite of fruit or anything sweet helps. In this case, sometimes I feel worse after eating. I've noticed a drink of milk tones it down a little, i'm guessing because it coats the stomach or something"
saplings,39hh9x,RandomGuyinACorner,2,Fri Jun 12 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The great thing about marijuana is that it hits so many areas of the body, mentally and physically. So, if something is wrong, we really don't find out until shit gets bad or we lay off for a while and start feeling worse.  Also, I got the idea from another convo between some growers (grower community). Turns out the guy did have an underlying issue but it wasnt anything terrible. He did need to tweak his diet."

Its hard for me even to get high from my mflb, because it takes me like 2 trenches back to back, which means shaking it up between every hit and making sure nothing burns, its just too much of a hassle. Dabbing lets me get just as high as 2 trenches in 20 seconds.   Maybe i need a different vape?"
saplings,39hh9x,DrQuaid,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:30:14 2015 UTC,Well my question is what's your grind consistency. I myself didn't like how long it took to get high from the mflb either but my biggest complaint was lack of accurate temperature control. My volcano is great and my supplier said that my crafty+bubbler was dab level. That thing hits so hard at max temp and a nice long milky pull.  There are better vapes out there. I still use my mflb for quick hits if I have migraines.

saplings,39hh9x,v111z,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't let the mflb discourage you. It's not a bad vape, just a very specific type of vape. The mflb is a conduction vape so it's vaporizing closer to the bottom of the screen. The volcano is a convection so it's pumping warm air through the entire chamber at once so you get more even and potent extraction.  Case and point, I took my abv from my mflb and threw it in the volcano at 446f. I got high off a week because there was soooo much THC and oils left that the mflb missed.  Edit- I forgot to mention I also have the orbiter and mflb but it still isn't as good."
saplings,39hh9x,greenshard,3,Sat Jun 20 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"Exercise, get out, do things that will distract yourself. The first day or two will be the most difficult but then after that it shouldn't be that hard. Exercise will be the best way to avoid withdrawals because it should make eating and drinking a lot easier due to the fact that you've expended your energy.   Also just about everything that is enjoyable or pleasurable is addictive, like junk food, excising (to some), and playing video games and you can get withdrawals from it if you stop."

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you have a whole lot. You need at least a gram or two of AVB to get high.

If you are relaxed and act normal, you should be fine. Even more so in the car. Just don't do stupid stuff. Act like you are the best citizen ever, don't break any rules. Don't give anyone a reason to give you a second look.  In the train, I'd advise you to put the stash in a small trolly or backpack or whatever, and to store it within sight but not in a way that it's obvious that you own it. If someone does come around and find the herb, at least they will have to prove it is your bag.  The most work ive ever put into hiding the weed would be to store it in a full peanut butter jar, and resealing it. Took a few tries and quite some time, and a drug sniffing hound probably would've picked up on it. While we had fun hiding it, it was just a lot of work for no reason haha.  Good luck!"

saplings,39g8kv,Skizzius,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"5 grams is a lot to put away in one session, depending on the number of people you are with.  Generally a high lasts between 2 and 3 hours, but it can obviously be extended beyond that.    That being said, if you goal is to be sober by 12, then you should aim to go through said amount in as quick a time as possible.  You don't want to be smoking still at 9 or 10pm to try and be sober by the time you get home.  If that's the case, joints and blunts man.  They are great for groups of people, fun and you can put it away quick."
saplings,39e3w3,Equility,9,Thu Jun 11 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"Under the fourth amendment, which allows peace officers to detain you, all they have to observe is ANY criminal wrong doing, or just a reasonable suspicion of any criminal wrong doing. So, in a decriminalized state, it is not legal, it is just a fine only offense, which justifies a detention under the fourth amendment. And even a full custodial arrest, for that same fine only offense. See City of Lago Vista v. Gail Atwater, 2000, US Supreme Court. In states where it is now fully legal, the officer could justify his actions in a civil law suit as a detention pursuant to federal law, and would succeed. That is the full legal scope of their ability. Now in reality, the cops on the street are interested in not wasting their time, looking like a fool, and try to focus on arrests that make them look good. So that means in areas where the laws say its no biggie, cops treat it that way too. But yes, they would detain you for a reasonable amount of time, then give you a ticket if they chose to, and release you. It is supposed to take around 15 minutes, or depending on other factors that may justify it being longer. Bottom line is this, dont do stupid things in public to draw attention. And when ever confronted by a cop be polite and dont be a jerk. Do not tell him what the law is. All that happens is he will give you a MUCH harder time, and then end up lying in the police report to cover the illegality of his actions. Always make the fight in court, not in the street."
saplings,39e8oy,GooddVibess,5,Thu Jun 11 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"okay so I am a longtime smoker and my first time was as a freshman in highschool. smoked out of a bong. I took like 5 or 6 hits because the weed didn't hit me until then. I felt fine immediately after my first hit so I kept taking more. It takes about 5-10 minutes for a hit to fully settle in and you know you are ""too high"" so to speak. A bong is 100% fine and 10/10 would recommend. I would suggest you take a pause between hits if your fear is getting too stoned."

Everyone experience varies, and its nice to have another stoner at your side.   For example, my first 2 times, I smoked and smoked, and really couldn't feel it.   When my brother smoked his first time, he underestimated how potent weed is, and was laughing non stop for 2 hours in a corner.  He hated it.   My 5 or 6th time smoking, I thought I could handle it alone, so I smoked my first joint by myself.   I was almost vomiting before I finished.   Joints are not for the weak.    Now my tolerance is much higher, and I could chain smoke joints if I wanted."

saplings,39eihd,puurbliss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:47:57 2015 UTC,"So Marijuana is a mild psychedelic which means it can get to the point where you start hallucinating if you get ""too high"" as you become more experienced with getting high and being very high you will start to be able to handle that state of mind better. So wait to try the heavier things until you become more accustomed to being at the higher levels of highness. when i first started smoking regularly i would get really fucking high with a friend but i had been really high a few times before and i knew i was in a safe place but once i was at a small party and smoking really really potent weed and got way to high and wasn't as comfortable in my surroundings but as i had been very high i was able to handle it pretty well after i sat down to collect myself and remind myself that it would be okay. Now on to a very important thing Marijuana it can amplify the way you feel before you smoke, not always but it can. If you are super nervous or anxious or anything like that it can affect you really poorly especially when you get to the really high levels. I would suggest in the future wen trying new forms of getting high that you be with someone chill who has more experience than you it'll make you feel better and make the experience better as a whole. when you get high try to keep yourself occupied if you just sit there the weird thoughts could end up bothering you and when you are doing something like playing a game or hving a really interesting and fun conversation and then you stop for a second and realize that you are blazed out of your mind its more fun. in the future if you get too high try to preoccupy your mind if you can't the shower was a good plan and food can help but i think you followed the general steps but try to put on your favorite music it can help more than you would think. and to try to ease your paranoia no your edible was not laced what you described is the effects of being very very high. sorry for the wall of text i just wanted to be thorough. and remember Marijuana is a drug that will affect your mind if you are prepared itll be great but if not results may vary. hope this helps good luck in the future :)"

saplings,39bwmr,Angus_Fraser,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:04:57 2015 UTC,I'm not in the most attentive state of mind right now.

I'm actually looking into getting a lotus vaporizer.

Puffitup has excellent reviews and customer service.
saplings,39bwmr,RandomGuyinACorner,2,Wed Jun 10 22:22:30 2015 UTC,"So here are some things I can comment to help you understand how vaporization works.   First, like your'e catching on, different temperatures release different oils in the material which have different effects on the body and brain.   here is an example chart but note that none of these temperatures are precise equivalents to their desired effects because such things like ambient temperature, moisture content in the material and the power of the vaporizer to keep a steady temperature without flux.   TLDR: low temps for head high, high temps for that heavy feeling  http://imgur.com/KE30Xye  That being said do you get high outside or at home more often? A portable is good but you get less temp flux and more vapor per draw out of your material.   Some great/ Powerful desktop vapes I recommend in no particular order are   e-nano+ glass bubbler  Volcano (preferably digit since there is only +-2F instead of +-9 in the analog but both are amazingly powerful)  Silver surfer  Portables I recommend  FM v5s (if price is an issue)  Summit  Pax2  Airizer air or solo depending on your needs  Alfa   Crafty  Mighty  The crafty and the mighty are the closest you can get to desktop out of a portable, specially when you connect it to glass.   Final note. I'm not saying any vape on this list is BAD but you do get what you pay for. If you are very passionate about your medication like I am then I would suggest just dive in for a high quality unit. If you are looking at portables only then look at the crafty and mighty as the top units and then work your way down."
saplings,39bwmr,TwinMalaysia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"I figure it's about half and half in terms of where I get high. I smoke slightly more often at my place when I'm alone, but I'll go to a couple of my friends' places and get high with them decently often as well. In any case though, I always get high inside, meaning that I don't go for walks or a public park and get high (although I'm not exactly opposed to the idea).   I've read up on both the ""Crafty"" and the ""Mighty"", and I do appreciate their specs, but other models from other brands that are quite a bit cheaper are only slightly lower in quality.

saplings,39a6w1,smartassing,7,Wed Jun 10 10:45:09 2015 UTC,Was that your first time? First timers / newbies have to undergo a weird transitory period where highs are all over the place. It will soon subside though.
saplings,39a6w1,FriedShrekels,4,Wed Jun 10 11:54:48 2015 UTC,I had tried twice before and I didn't get affected. This time it did and that was how I felt
saplings,39a6w1,luiz127,3,Wed Jun 10 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"Your first few seshes are going to be weird like that  You'll eventually settle (?) into a more normal high. I can't really say what it'll be like, that depends on both you and the weed you're smoking, but you'll notice it eventually"

Safe to say, I don't do that anymore =)  Like the others have stated, once you settle in to smoking a bit, you'll notice that your highs all blend together into two basic types, which most times is because of the type of weed you smoke.  There's the a.) Happy, fun, talkative, creative, energetic almost high that you get from smoking sativa blends.  Then you get the b.) Couch lock, super heavy eyes, super slow response time, feeling good but don't want / can't move high, that comes with smoking indica blends.  All in all, everybody has their own response to weed.  I'm sure you'll find that yours to be more enjoyable as time goes on."

Regarding parents vs country, I would argue that you owe your parents more respect and deference while they are actively supporting you, presuming a vaguely typical situation wherein they provide you with food, a place to live, etc.  Additionally, there's the idea that if you get in trouble as a minor, you can wind up exposing your parents to legal ramifications as they're expected to be acting as your guardians (which includes ""guarding you"" from doing dumb shit). The risk vs reward is just way out of balance, imo."

They can still get you for paraphanelia though, so watch out."
saplings,392s6b,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"Consumption usually isn't a separate offense. Even being high isn't actually illegal on its own. When you're consuming though, you're also possessing. And doing it in public is also generally an issue. Either way, even with a fine it can end up as a criminal record depending on your state. I live in a decriminalized state with some of the laxest actual laws on personal use and it's still generally a no no and people make sure do do things just as carefully as if you could be arrested for it."
saplings,392s6b,Martient712,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"You should read the law itself to get a better understanding. Ultimately, it depends on the cop and how they choose to invoke the law against you if you're caught.  Generally speaking, decriminalization is supposed to mean that it will not be a crime anymore, just a violation. For example, if you were caught, it would be a crime and automatic arrest and jail. Now, within guidelines, if you're caught, it's just a ticket like a speeding ticket. Of course, if you get caught too many times... you know the rest.  HOWEVER... I'm in NYC where marijuana is decriminalized. But, the NYPD are assholes. So, if you're caught with marijuana, depending on who you are (skin color), you'll get arrested even though you should just get a ticket. The problem is, if the cop sees you with it in plain view then it becomes a crime. Usually, the cops will pull it out your pocket or tell you to pull it out, then claim that they saw you with it out.  This is why I say, read the law. You'll have to learn what to do and most importantly what not to do. When I buy, I usually buy an ounce, sometimes 2. Since, I drive, I keep it in tje locked glove box. Or, since I have a vaultz case, I keep it locked in the case in smell proof bottles. Either way, where ever I go, it's in a locked container where cops can't say I had it in plain view. If I buy small quantities, usually a $20 bag, I'll stick it in my wallet, not loose hanging around."

High me recalls the same event by ""experiencing"" it again - the feelings involved, smells and sounds, visualizing the event in my minds eye.   But high me has a hard time converting these thoughts into English words that would mean anything to anybody. This post alone has taken me fifteen minutes (and still probably doesn't make sense).   High me feels and experiences reality more richly, more fully, and in truer fashion, but has a hard time expressing these things to commune with people.

As for smoking I can't say since I vape but I found that a low T vaping for me was .07 and a high (which is what i'm at these days) is about .13 grams a bowl.   Edibles are tricky though so just start small and eat more after an hour or two if you don't feel much. Your metabolism is going to determine how fast it hits you. Faster metabolism means faster reaction so if you have a fast one then an hour to an hour and a half is about how long it takes to start setting in but if you have a slow one it can take 2+ hours.   I know this might not help a lot but it's something until someone else replies haha.

If you miss the act of smoking, I would suggest getting an e-cigarette with a 0mg e-juice. That way you can fulfill your need to continue the habit of smoking without developing a nicotine addiction.   It just doesn't make sense to me as to why you would want to smoke oregano or other mixed herbs. You could continue to practice rolling joints with the herbs while vaping on an e-cig in the meantime.   In the end, it is your decision.

Imagine that you are using a straw when you are smoking, no matter which way you are smoking (joint, bong, bowl, etc.). Of course when we use a straw to drink something, we typically draw it into our mouth first, and then swallow. Try to do the same with smoking. 2 Motions. Draw the smoke as you are lighting (but of course don't light too long) or pulling on the joint/blunt. When it is in your mouth, let it sit for a couple of seconds to cool (also, this would be the best way to do any smoke tricks because it would all be there ready to go). THEN just blow it right back out.   I know it is difficult to wrap your head around if you usually take it straight to the chest. Try letting it just pool up in your mouth and then blow it right back out. Practice makes perfect of course!"

I also run a swab through the mouthpiece compartment, and then take a dry swab and run it through the whole thing.   You can take the parts from the mouthpiece and soak them in the alcohol for a bit, then scrub those too. I usually put the mouthpiece in a cup of coffee or hot cocoa with cream before I do this, drink it, and get some very pleasant effects from consuming the buildup in there.   I do a dry burn with the vape on its side after I clean it to finish things up. If it still smells like alcohol in the chamber after that, do another dry burn.

saplings,38zlew,Hexavxozy,3,Mon Jun 8 04:56:10 2015 UTC,That's an excellent point. Maybe try cleaning your piece? OP made it seem like you're using different methods of getting high. What have you tried so far?
saplings,38zlew,GetOutOfBox,4,Mon Jun 8 08:49:32 2015 UTC,"Probably tolerance. It's fairly normal for highs to diminish in intensity significantly over a period of regular use. The people who can still get absurdly high without smoking concentrates are just in possession of some lucky genes and are the minority.  The best thing you can do is wean yourself down (I do not recommend cold turkey as it can be unpleasant), and eventually quit. Take a month or two off and do your best to exercise regularly during this time. That is key, as moderate aerobic exercise (jogging, swimming, cycling, etc) sensitizes and increases the amount of cannabinoid receptors in the brain. This results in an increased sensitivity to cannabis. I took a 3 month t-break once without exercising, and only enjoyed a minor increase in sensitivity. Comparatively, a 3 week break with regular treadmill exercise (25 minutes every day at 5 miles per hour) significantly enhanced my sensitivity.  The reason why you can still develop tolerance with once weekly usage (though that is fairly low), is that THC is highly lipid soluble. This means a good portion of it gets absorbed into your fat cells, where it remains and is slowly released as they burn lipids/lyse (die). As such you continue to receive a low level of exposure to THC throughout the days following even a single use. If during that single use, you smoke a lot of marijuana, there would be more THC stored and thus more released over time. So you could conceivably prevent the rebound of tolerance with even once weekly usage, though that is unusual."

saplings,38zlew,DrQuaid,2,Mon Jun 8 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of factors, honestly. I'd definitely try switching up your piece and trying stronger strains. Maybe a real nice indica. You can also try mixing two different strains to make a salad bowl, because sometimes that will have an effect due to the difference between the two and you hitting em both at the same time. Alternate things you can try are making sure you're hungry before you smoke (don't starve yourself, that's unhealthy as shit, but you can just wait a little extra and maybe have a dinner already made for high-you. high you would appreciate it even if you get higher or not) to lower your blood sugar.   If those things don't work, you can try a different method. My first dab was absolutely fucking mind-blowing and got me to a [9] within like, seconds, and stayed there for hours. However, I've got a low body weight and a low tolerance, so that works in my favor.. But if dabs aren't practical, you could try edibles as well. They take longer to hit, but they usually hit pretty damn hard.  You could just be developing a long-term tolerance to shitty-grade weed, if you aren't getting good stuff.

(1 bowl gets me to a [7] but half a trench off my MFLB brings me up from [0] to [7])  An eighth off a vape would last longer than if you were using a pipe/bong/joints/blunts etc.  Yes, you'll save a ton of money and your lungs too!"
saplings,38y7ty,RandomGuyinACorner,2,Wed Jun 10 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've always heard the conventional wisdom as 3 times more efficient per gram than combustive methods, but perhaps four if it's a higher grade of vape than the mflb."
saplings,38y7ty,Itsmekevin7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:38:52 2015 UTC,"nah, mflb is probably the most efficient simply because it's not a session vape."
saplings,38y7ty,bicycle,2,Mon Jun 8 12:23:34 2015 UTC,I would say yes and no on the efficiency of the mflb. I vaped with my mflb for a full year before getting a volcano. I had all the mflb abv left over so I threw it in the volcano and man there was a TON of thc vapor left. I got HAF for a full week for free basically. MFLB is great but the stirring and stronger heat at the bottom of the trench makes it really hard to get everything out of your material.   However if your goal is mainly to make abv edibles then the mflb is great for that.
saplings,3907y0,koreaneon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:15:35 2015 UTC,A gram will be enough for two first timers. Can't give you a price though...  But maybe get more if you will be smkoing for an extended period of time.
saplings,3907y0,SSASERTPO,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:37:14 2015 UTC,"Buy more than you'll need, some dealers hate selling really small amounts. You won't actually need much though. Maybe a 1/2g per session. Idk what prices are like there but usually $10-20/g depending on quality and location. Buy at least an eighth (3.5g) and just save what you don't smoke."
saplings,3907y0,cartruck42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:55:19 2015 UTC,"I live in the UK and a gram is about £10 in my area, im new too tho so I may be wrong but the price is around that price."
saplings,3907y0,GoldenRubix,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"Get a quarter so you won't look like a tempie (someone trying weed out at first) which will cause your dealer to cut you or give you some shake/bottom shelf crap.  7g will last you and your grilfriend over the summer. $15/g seems to be the average street price of weed all over the world with pretty sweet bulk discounts if you buy quantities of common denomination.  0.05g got me feeling disassociated for 4 days the second time I smoked so take note of the moment when your body recognizes the influx of THC and CBD after the first experience. It is a normal experience for newbies to feel disassociated and a sign that they're smoking waaay over their tolerance levels.   TL;DR: Procure 7g, take it easy and make the most out of your weed!"
saplings,3907y0,FriedShrekels,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:57:12 2015 UTC,Do not get a quarter it'll last so long and since its your first buy you might get ripped off
saplings,3907y0,ld436,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"I smoked a qtr over 6 months and that's with once-a-week tokes. I did not get ripped off the first time and was given 2 extra grams instead.   There is a difference between a one-time customer and a 'regular'. Dealers want stability too. They prefer having regular customers than one-time customers. If you get a gram, you are immediately dismissed as a one-timer and shitty product will go to you. 3.5g will warrant you an accurate weight with nothing extra, nothing less.   Then at 7g, things change. You dealer suddenly cares more about you and gives you extra goodies because one-timers never commit but regulars do and they are the main source of stable income for the dealer. Devoting more customer service to regulars ensure good dealer-customer relations and foster business. Therefore, one would receive product of better quality/quantity if they were to purchase 7g and above."

saplings,38yokj,Afrew,2,Sun Jun 7 23:35:13 2015 UTC,Really depends on what you're looking for and what your preferences are. Portable or Desktop? Discrete or overt? Verbose settings or one button fits all? MFLB is easily one of the best portable vapes for its price range. I personally own an arizer solo and I absolutely love it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a vape.
saplings,38yokj,fatgreasycryptonerd,2,Sun Jun 7 23:43:04 2015 UTC,Portability and no stink is what I am looking for. The very low cost of the MFLB is just a bonus. Just once in my life I'd like to be able to park my duff on the couch and get stoned while I watch the tube.
saplings,38yokj,fatgreasycryptonerd,2,Sun Jun 7 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"Every vaporizer will have a stink but it's different. It does smell, just not like if you lit up a bowl. Smells more like some sort of burnt popcorn smell, it clears out in 20 minutes and anyone who doesn't vape won't really recognize it. I recommend looking into desktop vapes as well. Arizer has a nice line of portable and desktop vapes."
saplings,38yokj,DrQuaid,2,Mon Jun 8 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"to be quite honest, I used to love my mflb when i only smoked flower.

saplings,38yokj,FriedShrekels,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:51:31 2015 UTC,Was it scentless when you used it? Portability and stealth are my 2 biggest priorities.
saplings,38yokj,DrQuaid,2,Mon Jun 8 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"I smoked out of my MFLB in a crowded Chick-Fil-A, a museum, classroom, bathrooms, a fine dining restaurant, the mall, target, walmart, walgreens, and potentially anywhere you can think of as long as you master the art of MFLB camouflaging and have an uncanny sense of time and wind direction.  There is a way to reduce smell and that is to hold it in your lungs a bit then exhale. Also, wind direction is very darn important. If the cloud of smoke doesn't go anywhere near someone's nose, they can't smell it until you've safely returned the MFLB to it's lair.  Yeah, the MFLB is that stealthy... Could be my big hands tho :p"

When in use there will be a smell unless you are 100% pro at ghosting hits or you have a smoke-buddy/doob-tube/open window with fan. But it's a light smell that doesn't smell just like bud."
saplings,38yokj,DaVinciVaporizers,2,Mon Jun 8 01:01:25 2015 UTC,There are many good portable vapes in that price range. The MFLB just raised their price and aren't worth it as much because of all the good vapes at a lower price. /r/vaporents

saplings,38yokj,dudewiththebling,2,Mon Jun 8 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"So this is why I think people recommend other vapes over it.   My first vape was like many others, an MFLB. I loved it and got high off one toke. Everything about it, the size, the potency, craftsmanship, was amazing. Later on I got the orbiter and the power adapter because my tolerance and preferences were changing and I was trying to get more out of my little box. THe problem was I started looking at other vapes and realized I could get more out of my sessions.   Negatives I found after a year of use were   -The unit is small for stealth but you have to shake the thing every hit to not combust/ evenly vape your material so in the mean time you're shaking your hand for no reason/ trying to peek and see if any material got stuck on the screen and will get vaped twice which is bad and ends up burning it. THen you're also bringing around two things if not three. Batteries, stem, box. It clatters around n such in my pockets.   -I thought the mflb was good for getting the most even vaping if I had the best technique but when I got a volcano I get loads of vapors out of the abv material from my mflb. I got high for a week for free and it was awesome but made me realize you have to shake that trench so many times just to get 80% close to how much you get with a convection vape.   -The batteries started to die really fast and I ended up buying a lot of replacements. I like that they are removeable but they die way too fast.   -No precise known temp control. I didn't mind this at first but later on I realized and read up that different temps release different oils which have different effects. This really helps with me not feeling lazy during the day so I can work but also guarantee that I will get sleepy and ready for bed at night.   -not easy to share. My girlfriend took awhile to convince and most people I have try it have either gotten up to the point of combustion or actually combusted. It also is kind of a downer to have to explain how to use it when I could just hand my Crafty to anyone, ANYONE and they'll get high from it.   Those were the negatives I found.  I want even vaporization of material, for it not to waste my material, for it to vape that material very fast, and have precise temperature control. That's why I have a Crafty for my portable and a Volcano for my home unit. My GF is using my mflb at her place for the moment.   End note, is I know MFLB warranty is amazing and their service is amazing. That's why I don't regret buying it. But I think people should get a full proof vape first and then get mflb as that backup that will never let you down.   BTW i'm about a [9} from a dab I got from cleaning out my Crafty haha. Keep flyin."

saplings,38wc2w,GoldenRubix,48,Sun Jun 7 11:17:03 2015 UTC,"The entire idea of laced weed is stupid at best. Weed is a cheap drug. Why would you use more expensive drugs to make your cheap drug more potent while you can't get a profitable return on investment. Also, if word got out you are lacing your weed, no one would buy from you.   Even if you somehow got addicted after smoking a gram of laced weed, the chances that you buy weed from the same dealer is kind of small with such a long supply chain.   Both from a customer perspective as from the seller, it's a slim chance your weed got laced.   The only thing this makes clear, is that you probably aren't as comfortable with weed as you probably should be. You are scaring yourself and maybe even looking for a way out. Weed can enhance your emotions. If you are anxious about smoking (this) weed and you still smoke it for whatever reason, you might end up having a bad time.   Just take a moment to think about what you want. Take a step back for a moment.   I'm very convinced your weed isn't laced. If you want to be sure, show it to a seasoned weed smoker for a second opinion.   Have fun and be safe!"

saplings,38wc2w,AceOfReQuiem,17,Sun Jun 7 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's a slim chance it is laced, reason why is you may not get hooked on whatever it's crossed with. Therefore they invest money just hoping for an outcome rather then being a normal drug dealer who would sell it to someone that is guaranteed to come back for more. Make sense? Anyways it's dosnt really matter what we say, if you don't trust it don't use it, simple as that."
saplings,38wc2w,Shanack,12,Sun Jun 7 11:35:40 2015 UTC,I honestly think its more of an urban myth than anything else. Ive never talked to someone who knows someone that actually had laced weed. Im not ever gonna worry about laced weed..
saplings,38wc2w,TrippyToast0,12,Sun Jun 7 12:12:49 2015 UTC,Your friend is making you overthink it. I've bought from a lot of different people and have never bought laced weed. It's largely a myth.
saplings,38wc2w,itzptr,5,Sun Jun 7 12:17:19 2015 UTC,"http://www.cannabistutorials.com/how-to-detect-laced-cannabis/  Like it said lacing takes away from both profits and merit. Also the symptoms list for this and the article you read from (First result on google) aren't much to worry about except death and organ failure. I was worried that I had laced shit the second to last time I smoked because I underestimated just how high you can get, I hit a [9] the upper limits of a pot high rival mild phychedelics: http://i.imgur.com/geI6Y.jpg As long as you are getting nugs I doubt there is anything else in it. The only thing I try to avoid is large parties or gatherings with people you don't know. It's uncommon for dealers to mix stuff but dumb kids who you don't know or trust are far more likely to mix things in. I personally know a girl who got hooked on heroin because it was at a party and the joint had heroin in it. this was 4-5 years ago and despite quickly starting rehab their family still has trouble with it today. Nice girl, not anymore. I sometimes feel rude doing this but I always check to make sure nothing else is in it when I'm smoking with someone new, and make it very clear that its their business if they want to try other drugs, but that if they mix drugs that they are giving me, it becomes my business since I don't want to partake in anything but cannabis."

In my lifetime, I've never heard of weed actually being laced.   I've never come across a dealer who sold laced weed,  and i've never heard of anyone actually having laced weed.   As a teen, people who got really crystally weed would say it was laced with coke, but as I got older, and smoked it myself, and got familiar with the plant, I realized how foolish the idea was.   For one, coke is much more expensive, and the price of the weed always stayed the same.     The closest thing to laced weed I've come across is people cutting hash with Vaseline to make it weigh more.

As you can see here in the comments or in the general opinion on /r/trees laced weed is apparently a little rare in the states (or you guys just don't know what you're doing, no front :P).   Laced weed is sadly a very common thing in Europe. Even Dutch Coffeeshops sell bricked bullshit from time to time. It is almost never cut with a different drug like most Americans think but stuff like    hairspray (stickier, fruitier smell, looks like more trichomes)  bricks (plastic fluid with little balls, sticky, more weight, more trichomes) glass, sand or lead (mainly weight, glass might appear as trichomes) and more...   Obviously some are highly dangerous, lead can actually kill you. Read a little into the topic. You can test it by feeling, smelling, tasting, lighting a nug and observing the smoke, dropping a nug on paper and see if something falls out...

saplings,38wc2w,ssonti,10,Sun Jun 7 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Netherlands and I've been quite the regular smoker for around a decade. As tends to happen to a guy with this hobby, a lot of my friends are weed smokers or have been smoking weed. I live around Utrecht, most of my friends live in or around Amsterdam. I've been friends with growers, coffee shop dealers, normal dealers, and guys that organize festivals (even been part of the first aid team on those festivals). I have never ever heard about a personal experience with laced with anywhere in Holland.   If you are in the Netherlands and you are buying crappy brick weed, you probably aren't in a normal coffee shop.   A shop selling weed with any of the things you described is bound to be out of business before long. There is too much supply in order to make a profit with shitty, laced weed.   I'm sure, somewhere, someone, probably laced some weed at some point. I doubt that it's common in the rest of Europe, but I don't live in the rest of Europe, so I find it hard to tell. All I know is that even on my travels and on drug festivals, I've never heard anything about it. The most credible story about it would be that high schoolers sell the stuff to other kids and want to mess with them or something.   I do honestly believe that if there even are coffee shops that sell weed like you described it, it is very, very uncommon.  Weed still is viewed negatively by a lot of factions, media included. If weed like that got sold, the media would be all over that.   If I'm wrong about this, please inform me because I would really need to alter my perspective on the weed culture in the Netherlands. But please have something to back up your statements.   edit -    Just to clarify. I'm not calling you out to be a liar here.

In case you know a little German here is a very recent article about the new trend of aroma chemicals in the weed (Strawberry Banana Kush and the like). In case not the tl;dr is the weed is laced, very wet, rots away in the bag in a couple of hours and you're not allowed to use it with vaporizers in the Cannabis College who issue warnings all the time.   A quick google search turns up loads of experiences. More and more coming in the last ~5 years. The biggest German legalization movement, the ""Deutscher Hanfverband"", has a part of their website, the ""Streckmittelmelder"", dedicated to notify about laced weed.   Most people nowadays don't even know how good weed is supposed to look, feel and taste and the backdoor-policy bullshit of the Dutch system prevents any form of quality control.

Ill look into the tests because I have a few days ill be able the carry them out as I will have time to get rid of the smell.

The remains are quite literally ash and there is very little intact brown herb left. It also leaves a harsh smoke odor inside when off. I also think I cannot clean it and my only option is to keep combusting whatever is left in the chamber until it's ""clear"".  I'm only willing to pay $200-300 for a vaporizer in any case.

You want drugs, so you give them the money, and then they go to the supplier and buy it, and they bring it to you.   A lot of people will do it this way, so they don't sink their own money into it, and then have you back out. Now they could be down the money and be sitting on a bag they can't sell. I'm assuming you know somebody he has sold to previously, as you know he is a dealer.

Are you in a legal/medical state/country? If so things such as cheese, haze, kush, etc arn't really usually what they say they are.  There are 2 main kinds of weed, indica and sativa. I believe indica is from the middle east are, and sativa more western, so if its afghan it should have more indica to it.  If your going by street dealer, you may not get the strain hes telling you your getting. Just buy weed and look for good quality (smell, crystals on weed, nug shape, etc). And yes, you can easily smoke without tobacco, its more of a uk/european thing to mix, partiularly in spliffs (joints, but with a % of tobacco)"
saplings,38vdrx,AlgebraIsMyBae,4,Sun Jun 7 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of variables in the question.   How long a smoking/vaping session are you going to have? An evening? A whole night? A weekend? Do you live in an area where you can get quality weed? A gram of California medical grade can equal a much bigger amount of Texas brick. What strains do you have access to? if you get some GDP, you can have an ounce but you will fall asleep before you exhaust an eighth of it. Cost also depends on where you are. Let's say you are in a medicinal/recreational state and have a whole evening and have two grams of Northern Lights. That will cost you $30-$40 in California and much less in Colorado and much more in TX.   In TX I paid $50/oz for shitty brick and it took a couple joints to get high. Paid $160/oz for ""'corn"" or ""'dro"" and it took a half a joint. Paid $300 for a half oz of Jack the Ripper but I was off my nut in a couple rips. Now I'm in California and the game has changed.

saplings,38vdrx,RandomGuyinACorner,2,Sun Jun 7 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"Well of course it's better in Colorado and Washington than it is in California (but only slightly), and soon Oregon. When I lived in Texas, it was possible to get good weed but you had to jump at the chance, and pay a lot because the person providing it is risking prison if caught. There were dry spells. I expect it is that bad in the rest of the South. I have no idea what things are like in the Northeast and hope someone else chimes in. I doubt they get much of that Mexican shitweed that Texas and Louisiana has to deal with.  Also almost half the states have some sort of medical access now and if you have a qualifying condition in a place like Arizona, you can get into a dispensary. It's getting better, gradually, too. You might have to deal with bullshit for a couple years in a new state but you can at least have hope that the Chris Christies will be voted out and the freedom to buy cannabis will be voted in."

saplings,38vdrx,begrudged,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"Never apologize! If you're in Canada, you are OK with strain selection and the quality will be quite good, and I will step back and let a Canadian chime in with what to expect for cost.   I'd say a gram each will be more than enough for an evening. Most places in the US that would run maybe $40. This may be overkill -- I make a gram last me a week, but I do one puff a night. If you have a good sativa or hybrid, you can smoke down a couple joints each in one fun evening. If you get indica, you will be too drowsy to party after a bit. One gram will make a couple decent sized joints or one really fat one.  Have some cartoons, music, water, munchies, and pillows at the ready, and enjoy!"
saplings,38vdrx,gyrgyr,2,Sun Jun 7 04:32:18 2015 UTC,If you're in Canada a $20 bag is probably around 2 grams.  I go to school in Maine and that's what I pay there.  Canada is a big country though so it might vary.

saplings,38qzs4,bellsabean,18,Sat Jun 6 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"Alcohol is absorbed more efficiently on an empty stomach because there are more direct ways for it to be absorbed in your digestive tract. Since marijuana is inhaled and your blood oxygen (how the smoke is carried after passing from the lungs) has very little to do with how much you ate I am going to say that,  with some good human anatomical assurance, that smoking on an empty stomach will not get you higher but it will probably make you eat fucking everything so don't do it. If you want to get higher then eat some mangos as a chemical in it allows the THC to pass the blood-brain barrier more quickly."

Sadly it had a little bit of a chemical taste which is due to the production of the device. It should be gone after the first ~3 sessions. I don't need to say that we all got a solid [6] which is awesome because we didn't vape much weed.   2 of those 6 didn't like it as much as the other 4. They said it can't replace the classic joint, which I honestly hate after vaping. The joint somehow burned in my throat after like 5 hits from the vapor. I'd describe the joint as harsh and the vapor as smooth. I only smoked once with the vapor but all I can say until now, is that I love it!  It just needs a little bit of practice to know when the weed is done, I honestly don't exactly know how to tell when, but I am currently researching :)"

Atleast that's how I'd drop it. I wouldn't pull out any paraphernalia, If he's down don't show up with some 2 footer bong and 8 grams and get blown out of your mind, Id bring maybe a Joint or two, maybe a blunt if thats how you swing.

Cops check out parked cars all the time, more so if there is smoke coming out of the sun roof. Your first time will be fun and there's not much to be worried about but it can cause paranoia. So don't put yourself in a place that will amplify that, like in a car with worry of cops. Find a friends house, or go out to the woods for a hike, or somewhere away from people who will catch you.

Take a hit, wait 10 minutes, if you feel you can handle another, do another. I would not reccoment doing more than like 4 hits your first time, although 1 or 2 is good for most people. Your gonna cough alot, and it's gonna suck. It happens to everyone just make sure you have something to drink and try to take small hits. You're also probably going to get very hungry so make sure you have some good munchie food. Other than that have fun and enjoy the high. Good luck!"

saplings,38parf,monnet31,15,Fri Jun 5 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take two quotes and re-order them:   I'm just now starting to branch out and participate in social activities, and I got a part-time job, apart from my full-time job, on the weekend where I work more with the public than I'm used to.   I've been more curt and distant with people in the last 2 months, and my smile is sometimes forced and insincere.   Which, when read like that is completely normal. The drive to be social is exactly that, a drive. Like hunger, it becomes sated, and the need for it reduces. A burger when you are starving is awesome, but when it's being pushed into your face when you're full is less awesome, even unwanted.   If you've been dealing with social anxiety for a while, you've had this need going unmet, and it's driven you to do certain things, i.e. cure it. Now that you've got a grip on that, you're getting better at fulfilling that drive. This may not be dosage/THC related, so much as simply experiencing the consistent satiation of your social drive for the first time. You're full. You're want to withdraw, and take less pleasure in small-time social transactions because you don't need every crumb you can hoover up anymore.   That's a totally normal and healthy thing. It's not bad. The only thing I can suggest is that now that you've got the (social) quantity, do your best to focus on quality. Take time to reflect, focus on the social transactions that are the most meaningful to you. It's okay to remove the things (such as negative or neutral people) you don't like, and focus on growing the things (such as positive and helpful people) you do like. Prune the trees, so to speak, so the branches that bear fruit are given the appropriate priority.   Sounds like you've got this, mang. Kudos on finding an effective means of dealing with your ills."

I'm not saying that weed is ""addictive"" in the sense we are used to with cigs and other drugs but your body can get used to the effects it releases if you are a constant user like I am (vape .2 every night). Everyone will have different reactions but to wave off the notion that weed doesn't have any effect after cutting it off completely after using it for so long is to me dangerous because it gives a false sense of ease in a way.   Now do I think it's physically addictive? Psh, no of course not. I wouldn't be using cannabis if I did. Our bodies adapt though and to suddenly remove a factor it has been getting used to over a long period of time (6 months to a year) then I don't see why anyone would think will be completely normal as the day before you started using cannabis."

Dealers make money out of their buys so it's in his interest to sell to you. It won't be simply because you said funny or wrong that he won't sell to you anymore. Remember, so far, he's simply a dealer, not a friend but not a foe either, both of you are simply helping each other out.   Now, call him, obviously. Here, don't ask too many questions, you're simply a new buyer and you have to show him you are no danger. He'll ask himself ""How did this guy get my number"", so start with that (""my buddy (insert buddy's name here) told me to give you a call if I was looking to do some business"" or ""...if I was looking for some of the good stuff"". Never nothing to obvious to refer to the trees themselves, but subtle enough so he'll understand which, as a dealer, he probably will). From here on it depends on the guy's attitude. He might be a tad aggressive, but just assure him you mean no danger and simply want to ""do business"". Normally, he'll want to meet, so try and accept his terms, establish a professional connection with the guy and try your best at actually doing business! If you don't freak out, assure him you're no cop (don't actually say that, it's suspicious as fuck), all whilst maintaining a sort of alpha, confident (yet polite) attitude with him, it should all go swell.   If you're still in doubt, can you ask your friend? What the guy's name is, how he is in terms of attitude, etc... If your friend has told you he gets good stuff from him, mention and compliment the dealer with that!"
saplings,38rr7p,imnotrelevanttothis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"Call him up, no hurt in that. Chat with him for as long as you can and get a feel for what he's like. Ask him things like how long you been dealing? Whatya sell other than grass? Do you smoke? Do you do anything other than weed? Do you know the grower? Ect, (Dont ask all of that stuff in one call though. I think all those questions would be enough to sketch anyone out) If you feel more comfortable Suggest you guys meet up and deal. I would choose someplace generally public. Not at some downtown park, with 100s of people around, but some place that if something does go astray, people will notice and they'll be in range for you to call out to.

And honestly, neither should you - in some cases, cops can use even a text as probable cause, and they may be monitoring dealers. Keep in mind, cops are good at catching people. It's what they do professionally. So chances are, anyone who is more than pretty small time, and is not extremely careful, is probably at least on the cops' radar.   Not to freak you out, but a genuine warning that it's important to treat it with caution."

saplings,38rmak,fatman94,3,Sat Jun 6 05:32:01 2015 UTC,The vaporiser will probably be more pleasurable first time experience. If you can't find anything about your vape try asking on r/vaporents. But if you really can't get it to work then I'm sure a bowl will be very good too
saplings,38rmak,YourRapeyTeacher,2,Sat Jun 6 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"Have you ever smoked anything before? Because if you haven't smoking from a bowl may result in lots of coughing etc, because you just aren't used to inhaling smoke. BUT, if you can't figure out how to use the vape, that kind of answers your question for you then.  Just go and have fun, and report back and how it was to lose your Weed-ginity."

saplings,38q14y,layoutforbeaches,2,Fri Jun 5 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"Pieces will naturally start to taste more resinous, or that black shit that builds up. If you don't like the stronger taste scrape it out with a thumbtack/pencil/tools that you can get. A isopropyl alcohol soak will help loosen the resin up. Keeping a piece in a decently ventilated space is better. A stash box is a better way to keep bud/pipes/papers. If the smell is an issue though I don't think the bag will hurt."
saplings,38q14y,Scandicox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:46:44 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a stash box and a Tupperware container? If I don't have isopropanol can I soak it in water?
saplings,38q14y,Scandicox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:56:22 2015 UTC,Tupperware will work just drill / carve some holes for airflow. If you suspend the piece in a pot of really hot water it should take some resin off.

saplings,38q14y,D1STURBED36,2,Sat Jun 6 07:23:32 2015 UTC,"As you use it, yes it will begin to taste more and more butthole. You'll see a black build up at points, and then throughout the pipe leading to the mouth part i get a yellowy buildup, thats resin.  Iso alcohol (90%+) and course salt, put it in a ziplock and just shake and shake and that will remove it, then take something and try to dislodge whats left.  If you dont have iso and its just a little buildup, vodka can work to. But do get iso alcohol, its very handy."
saplings,38q14y,cartruck42,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:55:26 2015 UTC,It's just resin/tar buildup. Basically either get used to it or clean it often.

saplings,38o4r5,LoneRavers,3,Fri Jun 5 14:00:31 2015 UTC,Seems like these effects are anxiety related (feeling like your heart is pounding etc.) so I would recommend something high in CBD and lower in THC

saplings,38l5hu,weedthrowawaylol,14,Thu Jun 4 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. A good grinder is literally the first thing you should get in your kit, since it is helpful regardless of how/what you use to smoke. Some of the pros:   Ease. It removes a lot of the annoying and unnecessary work of hand-grinding Uniformity, as well as quality. Ground bud gives more consistent hits, and smaller pieces makes it more difficult to accidentally leave unburned centers of pieces. Kief catcher. Allows the collection of kief, which is great.   Things to look for: Don't get a plastic grinder. They dull super quick, and can get plastic flecks in your bud, which isn't something I want to be burning and breathing in. Metal grinders are much better, try to get something like zinc coated which has non-toxic fumes and is really hard, keeping a good edge. Sharpstone is a quality, inexpensive brand."
saplings,38l5hu,ARQBZAK,2,Thu Jun 4 23:16:35 2015 UTC,Why don't you just get a $30 electric coffee grinder?

saplings,38l5hu,MrMeridew,2,Fri Jun 5 04:49:55 2015 UTC,"Have you ever tried it? It works great, not as dusty as you might think, you just don't run the blades for as long as you would for coffee."
saplings,38l5hu,calculon000,4,Fri Jun 5 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess. But coffee grinders don't collect kief, make noise, require some form of power, and can't be thrown in a pocket. If a grinder isn't damaged or gunked up with ganj, it will work 100% of the time. Coffee grinders don't have that level of reliability. And plus, you can beat the shit out of a decent quality metal grinder. I feel like a coffee grinder is more fragile, with it having a plastic frame and mechanical parts and all that"
saplings,38l5hu,MrMeridew,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:22:36 2015 UTC,"TBH I prefer coffee grinders too for one-time grinding and then keeping it grinded, its just so much faster for larger quantities that the appeal is strong. Also, you can carry the ground bud with you instead of carrying the extra piece (grinder).   About kief, well, you're mistaken, actually most electric grinders are better for it as it centrifuges and separates automatically.   Durability is also higher, just dont throw sticks in it and you will be fine, it's supposed to handle much harder stuff.  And about piece-size, well, just dont go overboard with grinding, only a couple fast swirls will do the job.  That being said, the only actual downside I have found is that you ""invest"" in a strain, whereas when you use a metal one you can only grind and smoke what you need at the session so you can have different strain each day and you wont have to have 354325 containers for ground bud, just pick off the bag/jar"
saplings,38l5hu,HairyGnome,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:09:31 2015 UTC,"They do collect keef, it sticks to the inside of the lid. Sure manual grinders are ideal for being mobile, but I definitely prefer an electric one at home."

Make your DMV appointment, take that with you, and your ID will show up in about two weeks.   What you're going to get now isn't the state-issued medical cannabis card, it's the doctor's recommendation for medical marijuana. That's what you need in order to buy from a dispensary, not the card, which is a separate thing you can purchase but are not required to. Some recommendation places will write you a rec without a California ID, but almost no dispensaries will let you inside without one (with a few exceptions you don't want to be limited to).

saplings,38jpeh,Afrew,2,Thu Jun 4 20:16:13 2015 UTC,I'm confused also by the lack of an actual question.   First off are you trying to be stealthy about consuming/cooking or are you hiding the edible so your father won't eat them? When you heat up the marijuana into a form it can consumed it can leave a smell which is fairly obvious. If it's the smoke that bothers you I would look into a dry herb vaporizer(plugging /r/vaporents) so you can save your lungs and it gives you that sweet sweet AVB that you can make firecrackers with.
saplings,38jpeh,SPLOOGESPLOSION,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's in the post under ""The actual question"". How do you make edibles that can last for a long time without going off. (Had to repost this and must've forgotten to add the title.)  Vaporizing really doesn't do much to save your lungs as far as actual studies can tell.

saplings,38jpeh,cartruck42,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, smoking weed really isn't very bad for the lungs. The smoke has been proven to be less harmful than tobacco.

saplings,38jpeh,cartruck42,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:48:38 2015 UTC,Smoking anything is really bad for your lungs. There's nothing in weed that's toxic to the lungs but smoke can still scar them and destroy the surface tissue. Have you ever noticed running out of breathe when you've been smoking a lot?
saplings,38jpeh,ItsCookieTime,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:06:11 2015 UTC,"Smoke definitely damages your lungs, i'm not doubting that. I still wouldn't say ""really"" bad since (believe what you want) weed does have some positive effects on the lungs. Tobacco on the other hand is terrible in comparison especially since a tobacco smoker can easily smoke the equivalent of a 1/2oz (more or less) of tobacco in one day, where a weed smoker (as you obviously know) won't typically go over a few grams per day, plus the occasional tolerance break. Also yes after smoking a lot i've noticed that but it doesn't last long."

If you resist the headspace that the drug is bringing you into, it usually ends up kicking you in the face with some paranoia.   I used to get pretty bad panic attacks on weed but I've learnt to deal with it by accepting that not being in control isn't always a bad thing. Now I get to explore funky corners of my mind without getting that ominous feeling of doom that comes with anxiety."
saplings,38h7f1,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,2,Thu Jun 4 10:18:15 2015 UTC,"One thing I do is smoke and do shit. If I get bored I feel like I go insane. When I know I am going to smoke enough to make me spacey, I either smoke with someone else or I go out for a hike. That's when I just imagine whatever I want and let my mind wander to the past, new ideas, old ideas, or just plain nowhere.  Here is my best advice: You're high, have fun! You have gotten spacey in the past and nothing bad happened. You're high so in a couple hours max you'll be sober again. Just enjoy yourself. Also sativa strains make you spacey but also energetic. Indica's effect your more physically. More like, I like this couch, it is being very friendly to my booty. We must a a very bootyful relationship going on."

It actually, a few times, turned into a full blown panic attack (which I get sometimes anyway). Something that really kicks me out of it is standing up quickly and going somewhere. Give yourself something to do so your brain begins to focus on that and the anxiety you had about something or nothing slowly disappears. Honestly, you need to kick your brain out of whatever it's slightly panicking about and you'll have a good high.  And to be totally honest, I began to answer this because I was having a small anxiety thing and now I feel great!  Just remind yourself it's literally nothing and that nothing bad is going to happen at all  Happy toking!!"

saplings,38home,camos420,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:44:57 2015 UTC,Y'know I hadn't thought about that too many dryer sheets thing. Maybe I'll have to take a few out. Thanks!
saplings,38home,htolss,2,Fri Jun 5 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"Damn those are some intense precautions. The only time it could possibly even possibly smell is when the bowl is burning. To solve that you could just do snaps which involves putting only like a single nug or maybe a bit more and just smoking that and repeating the process so there's no smoke coming out of the bowl. I'd say you don't even have to do that with all your safety precautions. There's a website called stealthystoner.com that could help you out a bit. Otherwise I'm sure you're fine. Just make sure when you finish the fan isn't still pointed at the window and the towel is out from the door, otherwise that could be suspicious"
saplings,38home,AceOfReQuiem,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:46:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, that site is pretty cool! I'll definitely have to refer to it more often. Thanks for the info!"
saplings,38home,Afrew,2,Fri Jun 5 05:24:23 2015 UTC,I usually smoke leaning outside the window and i have absolutely no problems with it. You dont smell a thing.   Cooker fan works too.  So you are probably fine now :P

saplings,38home,siggie_balls,2,Fri Jun 5 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"Just as a side-note, sploofs made with dryer sheets don't do jack squat but mask the smell some. If you want a sploof that actually eliminates the odor rather than cover it up, make a sploof out of activated-carbon. Activated-carbon is really cheap for a decently big container of it. If you don't believe it, activated-carbon is what they use in filters for gas masks.  Anywho, it sounds as if you are smoking in your bedroom? Is that right? If so, all of your precautions should be working just fine; you don't really have much reason to fear of there being any smell. I usually go out onto my balcony to smoke, but recently I've been smoking in my bedroom, and all I need to do is open the window and turn on the box fan. I'll take a hit, put my piece on the windowsill, and then exhale out the window. I've asked my girlfriend to come into the room after I take a few hits to see if it smells, and the smell is either negligible or completely nonexistent."
saplings,38home,jack-dawed,2,Thu Jun 4 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I've definitely heard about the activated carbon thing from some other threads around here and I really wanna try it out! I heard it's the same thing that Smoke Buddies use to mask the smell.  I wish I had a balcony to smoke on, that sounds super cool! I'd love to be able to just go out and listen to the sounds outside while I smoke. Thanks for you answer!"
saplings,38home,Caitybeck,2,Fri Jun 5 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"I use similar precautions but less carefully. I don't spoof and I have my fan in the window facing out and smoke near it. I even went in and out of my room while smoking and didn't cover my bowl and the house didn't smell nor my room. If you want to be more cautious, wipe down the surfaces where you pack the bowl joint or whatever and the surfaces you ash on.  The smell might linger on you though. Hair clothes and fingers. Wash hands and use scented soap and lotion after, and not wear clothes hehe,  and shower with shampoo if you really don't want to smell. When I move my hair a few hours after smoking I get a gooooood wiff if I haven't showered.  Also I noticed that the kitchen air vent and my bedroom air vent kinda share air so if you really want to be careful check if the output of air vents in other rooms give off a smell while you smoke. And put weed away when it isn't being smoked or packed, that is stronger in my opinion.  But smoke leaving my room or smoke smell sticking in my room was not an issue with when I used those precautions.  For your neighbor.... Maybe depending on who they are and how much you smoke they may not notice.  There are always ways to get rid of more smell. But people probably won't notice any amount of smell on you unless they are looking for it or invading your privacy and personal bubble . So if someone is trying to prove you smoke I would try some of the things I suggested otherwise I think you are safe."
saplings,38home,Caitybeck,3,Thu Jun 4 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe I can stop using the sploof for awhile and see if there's any difference. And I'll have to check and see if it's going through any other air vents throughout the house as well.  Thanks for the answer!"

The scene at least here is a little closed off and a little paranoid still because of the quasi-legal nature of it.  Most of these places are larger facilities or operations and are caregivers with many patients or are growing for a dispensary.  From what I have been told you sorta need to know someone who works in the industry to maybe get your foot in the door.  If you had connections and can start off doing simple labor like trimming then that can get you in and at least talking with the people to see if they need help.    I am not sure how it is working in legal states, I imagine it will be a lot easier as you can grow your own plants at least. While I do won't advacate to get a medical card in a state that has them, it is way easier to at least get talking with those in dispensaries and what not about the product and people that grow.  If you have a medical need go for it, otherwise you may want to move to a legal state (or wait for other medical states to legalize it)."

Now for the good stuff:  Get some awesome music. I can link my favorite artist if you want  Get some nice foods. Prepare a sandwich or 2 so you wont have to leave your chair if you get the munchies. Food will taste better aswell so go all out. Also, have plenty of drinks, no alchohol preferably nor very sugary stuff. Apple juice is so good for me personally.  Have a movie and/or games to play if you need to be busy with something. Comedy is fun, action is fun too.  As for the strains, they are both great. the Kush will probably be more giggly and the white widow will probably make you realise things that make absolutely no sense what so ever.

Crisps/chips are good too for example but i like healthy snacks as im a bit of a healthy food nut.. Water is perfectly fine but its rather tasteless. Id strongly recommend fruit juices but thats just me.  As an avid gamer Id say The Witcher 3 is one of, if not the, best game ive played. And that says a LOT. Sounds like a good plan to me. The Witcher does get a little ""dark"" at times, that bothered me a bit when i was playing, but music helps.   I would actually suggest getting both but id stick with one of em and smoke the other one later. Depends on how much you are getting but with vaping you will need almost nothing to get really high, so be carefull.   You dont need to limit yourself to vaping once a night. You can take another hit after an hour or something to lengthen your trip.  ""Bad"" trips length depend. You might green out (go to sleep) and after 20 min and thus it would be 20 min. Truth be told, if you have a sucky sucky trip you might be stuck for 2/3 hours. Which is highly unlikely. Its not like other drugs where you cant influence it. Tell yourself it will be ok and stay positive and you wont really have that bad a trip in my experience.   How much are you looking to buy? You will probably only need .2/.3 grams to get wayyy up there. Need help with the dosage and packing your vape?  Be sure to let me know how you liked it too!

Actually, yeah water was a dumb suggestion, I'll look into some juices instead. I guess maximizing my newly-enhanced taste buds is something I should be doing.  I was worried about TW3 being too heavy but I can just stop playing it if so. How does it compare to Skyrim/Fallout for immersion and amount of quests? I've never played a Witcher game before so I'm unsure of what to expect.  I'll get both then. I'm only going to get a gram of each to start with. I might hate weed so I don't want to start with too much.  If things do turn bad do you think writing myself notes telling myself it'll be fine beforehand is a good idea? I've never had a panic attack or anything before so I can't imagine what it'll be like. Hopefully things will be OK but there's no harm in being prepared.

saplings,38i6ve,ld436,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"Water is actually toxic in very large amounts.. Couple years ago when i  recreationally used MDMA one of my friends drank way too much water and had to go to the hospital x)  TW3 is a better all around game imho. Better storyline, better game mechanics and although unfair, better graphics. Immersion is better and massive amounts of quests. You can watch some storyline things from The Witcher 1 and 2 to have an idea of the world and its lore from youtube.  The major thing is that it is in fact a really hard game. Its somewhere between Dark Souls and Skyrim. Preperation for adventuring is a must and gearing up is essential. Even the slightest upgrade will mean a lot. Given those things, actually defeating hard monsters/humans/bosses is really fullfulling.  Also, it has a cool card game similar to hearthstone.  Its a terrific game.  Notes are fine but you will be conscious, more conscious when comparing to be drunk for example so it might not be necessary. Panic attacks wont really happen unless you are allergic to weed or something and even then it would be something to trip out on a panic attack.  Just be aware it you might feel anxious or paranoid but in my experience, doing fun stuff and music help loads.  Might aswell write the notes, no harm done doing that. Do make sure you clean em up otherwise, no reason for a random person to read you do weed.  Im sure you will have an amazing time! Playing the witcher with good food, drinks and good music is a treat on itself. Being high will only make it THAT much better!   Dont mention it, its my pleasure!"

I will look up the story/lore as I don't want to be too overwhelmed. Also the preparation will be interesting because I've never really had to do that in a game before. I've never played Hearthstone, but I'm sure I'll like the game as I usually like those sorts of things.  Ah yeah, I guess I am comparing it to being drunk a little bit as that's all I know at this point.  I'm looking forward to it for sure! I'll let you know how it goes."
saplings,38i6ve,Afrew,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:53:46 2015 UTC,Water is the best for cottonmouth but I reccomend juicy fruit like apples as well. You'll probably be high for 2-3 hours and then just feel a little off. Once you sleep you'll wake up and still might feel a little off because it's your first time but you won't be high. It'll fade as the day progresses. If your in an illegal state don't worry about the strains to much because dealers lie and make up the names of their strains all the time. If your in a legal state then I would definetly go for the kush.

If you pay roughly $12.50 for a gram, and others around you charge $14 or $15, then you know you got a good deal. ut also keep in mind that many Dispensaries do lab testing and can tell you the THC content.  $12 for 18% THC is as good a deal as $17 for 24%. I have a lower tolerance, so I can get the cheaper mids and still feel high as balls off of that."

Every time I've bought weed, the dealer will ask how much I want(1/8,1/4 etc. etc.)and tells me the price for each; or I tell him how much I want to spend, and he says how much bud I'm going to get. As a general rule of thumb, an 1/8 should take up half a ziplock(I mean just like the bottom, maybe going an inch up towards the top.)a 1/4 should take up the whole bottom of the bag, and a half should take up most of the whole bag!"

saplings,38aat4,StJupiter,25,Tue Jun 2 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"I've posted this one before. It's kinda long but here it is:  I used to really dislike going to a dealer. Therefore, I would always buy large quantities of weed so I wouldn't have to visit them often. Since I use a vaporizer (Da Buddha), I also save all of my vaped bud. Whenever I ran out of weed to vape, I would take all that vaped bud and make edibles, which would keep me going for another few months (meaning I wouldn't have to go to a dealer for even longer, woo!).  Anyway, after finally finishing the last ounce that I had gotten, I had about 14g of AVB leftover. I decided to make some cannabutter and use it all in one batch of brownies. Nothing special, just one of those store-bought mixes.  I made the brownies and they tasted alright. Everyone I gave one to said they tasted delicious but I personally thought they just tasted like pot. Anyway, I decided to try a test brownie and I cut what I would consider a regular-sized brownie (non-medicated, that is). I knew that this might be a little much but I figured what the hell, why not? What could go wrong?  Oh boy. I should probably mention that I took the day off of work so I'd have the house to myself and I could make these. My girlfriend probably wouldn't have cared, but I didn't want to stink up the house with her in it (she didn't toke much if at all at the time). Plus I wasn't working on any important projects at work so I was clear to take the day off.  I can't remember how long it took to kick in, but I began to peak at a true [10] about 3-4 hours later. It was intense. I remember being at about a [9] when I realized it was 4:45 and my girlfriend would be home soon. I didn't want her to come home with me absolutely fucked out of my gourd and find out I'd taken the day off of work, so I did the only thing that my stupid brain could think to do: I went to work.  I should also mention that I was expecting a package at my office. I sometimes order shit there so that I can actually get it that day instead of having them leave one of those slips on my door at home. So I decided that I would go to work, get the package, and then come home. The fresh air would do me good and help me come down.  Getting on a packed subway during rush hour while at a [9] is not something I'd like to experience again. I wore my sunglasses the entire time and probably looked shifty as fuck but if I didn't then my puffy red eyes would have been immediately obvious to anyone who looked at me.  When I got to my office I realized that I'd failed to account for one thing: people in my office. I couldn't wear sunglasses in there, that'd be suspicious as fuck, and they'd know that I took the day off to get baked. I carefully opened the door and walked in. The first good sign: the two desks that can see the front door had nobody sitting at them. And my package was on one of the desks!  I slowly walked towards it and thank god, my boss wasn't at his desk either. I looked down the hall and noticed a couple people there, but they couldn't see me so I grabbed the package and ran.  It was about at this point that I felt like I was finally coming down. I got on the streetcar and I felt good. The weather was nice, it was sunny, and I was happy. When I transferred to the subway though, I realized that nope, this is still going on, and it wasn't getting any better. I remember being paranoid as fuck on the subway again.   The rest of the day is hazy, but all told I was gone for a good 24 hours, 12 of which were spent at a solid [9]. I remember waking up the next morning at about a [2] or [3]. I divided the rest of my brownies into much smaller pieces, each of which was great for a good 5-6 hour session.    TL;DR: Made pot brownies with ~14g AVB, ate a large brownie and went on a poorly thought out adventure, [9] for 12 hours, woke up the next morning at a [2] or [3]."

saplings,38aat4,DIARY_OF_A_TRAP_GOD,3,Wed Jun 3 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"I had to ride the subway after taking my first dab off a glass rig. I stopped in to this kind of sketchy dispensary because I saw it on Weedmaps in the hood I happened to be running errands in. The first time patient ""gift"" was the budtender serving me this huge dab, and I hadn't even planned to smoke that afternoon.   It was really awesome at first because I felt like I was floating above my body watching it go through the motions of getting to the train station almost as if it was on autopilot, until I got to the turnstyle and I didn't have the fare on my card. I went to the machine to add some cash, knowing this was where things would become challenging. The lady at the machine next to me couldn't figure out the fare system. She was from San Francisco and couldn't comprehend that LA's Metro has a flat fare each way instead of the BART system that charges you per station that you travel. She wanted me to help her, which was a huge mistake. Every time I tried to guide her through the menu, my machine would time out so I would have to start over. Then she started loudly complaining to me about how it wasn't fair because she was only traveling two stops, she shouldn't have to pay, LA totally sucks and isn't as good as SF, and on and on. I could feel myself somehow getting higher while this was happening, almost like I was about to ""depersonalize"". So I walked away and got on my train.  I felt really sad for a moment like I'd been rude to her, but then very sure of myself that it was what I had to do. I started to get this awesome euphoric rush, and realized that everyone around me on the subway could smell the intense amount of weed I had just picked up, but instead of paranoia that made me really happy somehow! The rest of the ride was like a video game. My tolerance is a lot higher now than it was then, but I wouldn't mind going through the experience again minus the encounter with the confused lady."

saplings,38aat4,Cobalt_97,8,Wed Jun 3 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"A few years ago in my freshman year of college, a nice dude from my dorm gave me a pot brownie his sister made. At this point I had smoked pot two, maybe three times in total, and never more than a couple puffs at a time. Being a naive noob, I ate the entire thing.  30 minutes go by. I'm feeling pretty good. Time is stuttering along and everything feels a bit dreamy. I remember a couple girls from our dorm stopped by and they knew as soon as I opened the door. I think I spent about an hour in a similar state, before deciding I'd had enough and that it was time to go to bed.   But, closing my eyes, my mind could not stop racing about children's cartoons. I saw the cartoons very clearly in my mind, they made me feel nostalgic. My whole family was sort of represented in this crudely drawn animation, and it was the only thing I could think about. Since this is my first time being so high, a little paranoia starts to set in, of the classic, ""Oh God, I'm gonna be high forever..."" variety.   Things start taking a turn for the worse and I'm having a full blown panic attack right in front of my roommate. I'm now pretty convinced I have destroyed my brain and will remain like this for the rest of my life. I found our little trash bin and hugged it for emotional support. 3 planes of reality, a good plane, a mediocre plane, and a bad plane. I'm stuck on the bad plane of reality and I cannot escape.   My girlfriend at the time was also pretty anti-pot so that just makes things worse, because the whole time I'm thinking she's going to break up with me over this as well.   Anyway, the high starts to come down, but things are still weird. I let my roommate fly my model helicopter around, and he's a god-awful pilot, crashing into every wall. I don't give a fuck, because I'm still stoned out of my mind and all I can think about is how the helicopter is all about ""abajibajaju"" and ""florast, florast"" depending on if its moving left or right. Don't really remember anything else except waking up the next morning still slightly high. I then wrote the best essay I have ever written in my entire life.   The moral of the story is don't eat the entire brownie at once, especially if you don't know how much pot is in it. That being said, though that was a terrifying experience, I'm glad it happened. It was illuminating in its own way."

I was super paranoid and kept thinking I heard my mom coming home, and I kept imagining me getting in trouble and it felt like my thoughts had really happened. The whole night I was on edge and scared shitless. We decided to wait a few hours to go home since we were too high to pretend we werent. After 3 hours we still felt the same and were even more lost than before. We left my house and my friend puked all over the road on the walk home. We succesfully made it to his house and eventually went to sleep. So that's the story of my one time at a [10] although it was terrifying it was definelty unforgettable and worth the $10.  TLDR: took edibles didn't listen to the warning got way to high, friend puked everywhere"

saplings,38aat4,Mellonpopr,5,Wed Jun 3 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"My sophomore year of college (this past year), three other friends and I decided to go into the frisbee golf trails to smoke.  It was a beautiful night to just stand out in the dark woods and just completey chill out.   We drive a few minutes to get to the trails and it was about a 30 second walk to our spot from the parking lot. We get to our spot and get set up, take a few hits and continue to pass.  It has been about 20 minutes at this point.   We hear a car pull up... Crap. We put everything out and be very still and silent. Now, we see flashlights... Double crap. Now we see two people walking into the trails and they were definitely cops.    At this point we are hoping that they don't walk that far into the woods.  We silently walk a little deeper and around a little corner of trees, thin enough to see where the flashlight beams are pointing, yet not thin enough to see either party through.   Unfortunately, they are just about to turn the corner and we zip off through the trails. I follow one friend and the other two go another way. I also hear my friend ditch his backpack into the thick brush.  I am trying to catch up to my friend, who is number one on the track team and in better shape than I am, as we dip and weave through the bushes and trees off the trails by now. Aaaand I lose him. He had no idea I was following and I did not want to yell to attract attention.   I finally make it to some road and I was so glad I had my phone with my GPS with me. I figured out where I was and looped around back to the dorms.  I call my roommate to let me in as I left all my keys and things in the car.    My friends wound up back the dorms and we met up and talked.  It turns out the other two were caught because they kneeled down in the bushes after a while.  They just told the officers that they wanted to make things kinky and have some sex in the woods and that the car was his roommates as he was borrowing it for the night (which his roommate was the friend I was trying to follow).   It was such an adrenaline rush.  10/10 would do it over again and again and again."

When I was 17 we used to take our cars down to a disused field and slide them around in the mud like you do with your first car. We also used to tow each other behind the cars using rope and stuff like sledges and dustbin lids.  One day I decided to buy an dirtboard (off-road skateboard) like this one. We then decided that we could probably parasail behind the car if we built up a bit of speed and made a parachute, so that we did. We got a rectangular bit of tarpaulin, tied bits of rope through the metal ringlets in each corner and tied the other ends of the bits of rope to a rucksack. We then cut a hole in the middle because ""that's what parachutes have so this'll make it work"".  I strapped myself into the dirtboard, tied a rope around my waist (the other end of which was tied to the car) and off we went. We hit about 30mph before I threw the parachute. The wind caught it and it lifted me up about 10 feet into the air before violently slamming me back to earth. The impact broke 4 ribs and being dragged along by the car after hurt like fuck.  In hindsight, this was never realistically going to work."

Raise to your mouth  Take lighter, put it on its side, strike with index finger as to not get burnt.  Hover the flame over the weed, dont dunk the flame into the entire bowl, just gently over part of it so it lights. When you see a cherry been lit, take flame away, and take a slow draw, you should see the cherry expand, the faster you draw the faster the cherry goes, just draw at a steady pace, towards 70% lung capacity slow down, remove mouth, take a breath in to push it deep into your lungs so your at basically max capacity, hold for 3 seconds and release. Repeat over and over again until the bowl is done, black and white and it wont generate smoke, or until you just dont like the taste.  If it has a carb (likely, the small hole) hold it during the entire draw, and let go when your done and suck in the last bit of smoke in the chambery bit.  Because im a cheap skate and go for maxiumum efficiency, i hold the lighter (clippers are great) or similar item over the bowl to stop the cherry, while the carb is off to get that last bit of smoke so it doesnt go stale.

saplings,389xcw,GoldenRubix,2,Tue Jun 2 21:04:09 2015 UTC,Try to get a container with a screw on top. I would say just put it in a drawer under some stuff if your parents aren't nosy. Note that drawer might smell abit. I would say use a joint at first. One bongs are expensive so not really worst it before you figure out how often you smoke. Use a joint and inhale correctly because a bong might get you to high your first time. Smoking with experiences friends is better than smoking alone but smoking with inexperienced friends is worse because then they might panic. I don't think your missing anything on your list. I don't think your to young I started when I was about to turn 17. I think it's a mindset thing. If it interferes with your school or work then your to young and immature.

saplings,389xcw,Kellbelll,2,Tue Jun 2 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"A plastic baggy definitely won't be enough. Like someone mentioned put it in a drawer under stuff. I'd put it in a baggy in a container... In another container.. In a drawer you don't open all the time. Personally mine is in a baggy in a little empty lotion bottle you can get at target like stores, in a tin with my bowl, which is in a bigger box in a drawer. And when I open the drawer I get a nice and smelly wiff still.  Like others have said it's good to smoke with an experienced friend. Joints are not easy to roll too so  having them roll one or have them provide a bong or bowl would be ideal. They can teach you how to use the pieces and keep it cherried to hand off  to you so you don't have to lite it. It's not easy the first time. And its easy to accidentally get too high and it's also common to not get high the first time or know how to tell if you're high.  Seems like you plan on bringing all the right stuff. A fresh shirt might be a good idea too to ease your mind that you don't smell. Also juice is better for coughs than water in my opinion, coats the throat. Have fun!"

Numbers: 5G = 5 gram (about 1/5 of an ounce). 1/8th = an eighth of an ounce. (Usually imperial. Maybe Troy of if your dealer is being weird as a imperial oz is 28 g and a troy oz is 31)  Tips: Whenever you buy you should scout out the dispensary. Ask friends if they are any good. And first time you buy, buy small. Try out the goods and if it's ok, go back.   Most of all... Treat it the same way you treat alcohol. Use a little till you know how you'll react to it...

How much water are you drinking? Or why in the fuck are you currently not drinking water?   Explanations:   When you take a urination drug test, they are testing your lipids, or fat cells, for traces of illegal substances including THC.  Obviously if they are looking for traces of THC, how often you are putting THC in your body will matter.  Water is a clean and easy way to detox your system. I recommend buying a gallon of water and drinking a full one everyday.    I have super low body fat, but smoke multiple times everyday. I failed mine in about a 10-12 day stretch. Drink as much water as you can, if you smoke everyday, you failed that shit, might as well get baked right now."

A lot of stuff tends to settle at the bottom of your bladder and thus, gets peed out first.  With that said, your safest bet is always to get clean pee in a travel shampoo bottle, hide it under your balls (or in your ass if you're serious) a few hours prior to your test so it can get to body temp, and use that for your test.  Any anecdotal evidence regarding time is purely that, anecdotal.  The people saying regular smokers clean out in 1-2 weeks are insane, though they may have passed a test (or not been denied employment and still tested positive).  I'm not saying they're lying, but there are far too many factors to work with, genetic and environmental, to accurately estimate, my wife is a daily smoker like me, and she still dropped positive after 6 WEEKS.  Clean pee is the only way to be sure.  They don't test sex, so it doesn't matter if it's male or female, and it being at body temperature is the most important part."

saplings,385cio,1884848199939,3,Mon Jun 1 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"Hi man!  Dutchy here and no stranger to Amsterdam or coffee shops. It's illegal for coffee shops to sell to tourists, but only in a few city's they actively enforce this rule. In Amsterdam you'll be fine, and even if one shop won't sell it to you, there are about 250 more coffee shops.  Prices vary. The more touristy the shop, the more you'll pay (in general) and especially the ""bulldog"" franchise is known for it's tourists prices.  A gram of good weed is about 5 to 7 euro. The best strains cost about 12 euro, if they have some rare stuff it can go up to 15, but you are usually just overpaying by then. A gram of hash will cost about 5 to 10 euro.  You're allowed to carry 5 grams of weed or hash. If the police finds you with more (they don't search you unless you really, really, asked for it) they'll take it and fine you. Everything under 5 grams you won't get fined for.  If you were to take weed out of Holland, you'd probably want to check the laws on weed for that country and city. I know that in Berlin they won't do anything about 5 or 10 grams or so, but in a lot of other German places they can be really uptight. I believe Belgium, Spain, and France also have weird weed laws, but i'm not to sure about that.   If you got more questions, just let me know."

What general areas do you recommend for me with cheaper prices than near the airport and that are chill with selling to tourists? As for quantity, 5g should be plenty since my tolerance is still low and I can't bring anything back home :p  What are the procedures for buying/smoking weed there? Do they sell you nugs of weed that you have to grind and roll into joints, unless buying prerolled joints? Do you smoke inside the coffee shops or right outside or anywhere...?  Also any cool spots you think I should visit while there? I'm planning on visiting a few places in Amsterdam and Germany and have about a week and a half or some. Thanks again for the advice!"
saplings,385cio,spoetnick,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:22:19 2015 UTC,"You're welcome buddy! Love to brag about our weed and coffee shops, lets just hope they remain legal for a while.  I usually go for the smaller shops if I just need a pick up, but I stay away from the ones that looks really sketchy. In the center of Amsterdam is a shop on nearly every street. The bigger shops always have a smoking/lounge area with a bar or something (almost nowhere do the serve alcohol in a coffee shop btw), nearly all shops provide some form of smoking area. If you can't see it you should just ask.   If you want some information about your herb, don't go to the really busy shops, they are more about quantity and less about the herb. The smaller shops can usually tell you a good bit about what they are selling.  All weed you buy comes in a nug or nugs (exception being, like you said, the pre rolled ones). Every shops sells grinders, and most shops just have them around next to the ash trays as a service. Rolling papers and paper filters can usually be found at the bar. Most people take about 4 or 5 of each.  Smoking outside isn't legal, but unless you're blowing in a cop's or city guard's face they won't care. The further you go from the center, the more they'll bitch about it.  It depends on what you like and who you're with. If the weather is nice, go to the Vondel Park and walk around. Plenty or people to look at and a general nice vibe. If you want some culture, go to the museum plein. Some of the best museums the Netherlands have to offer are there.  Walking around in the Red Light District if a common tourist thing to do, so yeah.   Plenty to do and see, depending on what you want to see."

I'd love some culture, the main focus of my trip is some big cities and a hike in the mountains. Is it ""safe"" to go into museums with weed in my backpack? I won't have more than 5grams but will they search my bag at the entrance or something?"
saplings,385cio,spoetnick,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely fine with weed in your pack. Like /u/spoetnick said, its a problem with 5+ grams if there is any at all. They wont search your bag as its legal to carry less than 5 grams. No worries at all mate, most coppers dont care anyways.  You can get a public transport cart for a couple days and visit cities like Utrecht, Haarlem or Rotterdam, its quite cheap. As for going abroad with weed, you wont be searched untill france or germany if you get searched at all. Its your choice tho.  Strains change a lot, there is no telling what shops will have in supply if not for some really popular strains in bigger shops. Premium weed is always nice, but ive grown fond of outdoor weed too, which is slightly less expensive but still good.  Smoking indoors isnt accepted anywhere tho. Leaning out of your hotel window while smoking isnt smart either. Just go outside.  Edit: Note: Shiphol Airport is near the city, not in the city and you will not find any coffeeshops around the airport. You will need to take the train to Amsterdam Centraal (central) probably."
saplings,385cio,SeppelBond,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"Prices per gram are all about the same, even outside the side. Yet if you were to go to the country side or something, prices might start to fluctuate. For example, I'm currently in a small village outside of Utrecht and a gram of white widow costs me 8 euro, in Amsterdam the same strain of a little better quality costs me 6 or 7.  Bigger shops have a big selection. Seeing more than 10 strains isn't rare. Id say anywhere between 3 and 10 strains is average for a normal shop. If you are looking for something particular you might want to look around for a bit, because if one shop doesn't have what you want surely another will.   There's this shop with volcano vaporizers you can use, I'd say that's worth checking out. My personal favorite is just plain old og kush or Hindu kush. Yet super silver haze is a good pick if you want to get fucked up. Another thing surely worth the money is ice-o-lator. A extract made by freezing the herb inside a centrifuge. It sets you back about 15 euro but it's very potent. If I feel experimental I usually just buy something with a intriguing name that the shop owner recommends for about 10 euro.   There's a lot of culture in the Netherlands, mountains are harder to come by. You can just bring your weed into the museum, just don't make it obvious. Since weed is condoned and not legal some people have to make a problem about it if you are walking with a bug in your hand. I usually have about a gram on me for the last decade and I've never had trouble because of it.   If you want some culture, at least go to the Rijksmuseum, my personal favourite so far. Het Stedelijk museum is also has a lot on display. The Anne-Frank house is worthy of visiting as well. Kind of small but impressive in its own way. There are also plenty of old and new buildings with nice architecture."

Can you provide more info on what type of edible you were planning on using and its THC content, and also your tolerance?  Personally I would not take this gamble with an edible when you have something important to do within such a short window of time. I really like Kiva bars because they're so easy to regulate doses with, but I've had the effects from one 45mg/THC piece last me anywhere from four to twelve hours. Sometimes it depends on what's in your stomach prior to taking the edible and how much THC you've ingested in the days leading up to taking it, sometimes it doesn't.  Is there any way you could smoke or vape beforehand instead? I really love edibles, but this seems like a situation where at best you're going to be anxious at your meeting, asking yourself ""am I still stoned?"" over and over again in your mind, or at worst, just... unable to function. Honestly I would consider saving the fun until AFTER your responsibilities are out of the way."

The brownie is supposed to have ~200mg of THC and I was planning on taking <1/3 of it. My tolerance is through the floor, however. About a 1""X1"" piece of this stuff got me so floored I can't even remember about 4 hours of the day from the last time I took it.  In any case, my prior plan was to eat some at around 8am and see where things ended up by 9am... The only issue is that I honestly have no idea how long it will last.

And that's even if you have a high tolerance. Obviously this kind of requires clearing your schedule for the day, or having one activity planned to focus on. In this case, I'd say it's not worth it.  Fun semi-related story: I visited Disneyland the other day and brought a tin of medicated chocolate-covered espresso beans (called Terra Bites, if you live in California I definitely recommend picking these up). I like them because they're 5mg each so it's easy to control your dose over a whole day rather than waiting for it to kick in and come down. I started with 10mg at the beginning of the day which didn't do anything on its own, but by the time I was in the park I was cruising really comfortably toward the doorstep of the psychedelic, right in time to get on It's A Small World. Ended the day with Pirates Of The Caribbean around 11 PM, and by then I had taken 90mg and was maintaining a really nice lucid euphoria. No time dilation or anxiety, which I probably would have experienced at my medium tolerance had I taken that same dose all at once.  If I'd had to go in to work somewhere in the middle of that, though, it would have been a fucking nightmare."

Take a hit Without blowing any smoke out, take in alittle clean air Wait 3-5 seconds Exhale   Wait on it alittle bit and you should be really high. If you are not it could be the piece or the quality of the weed. 4 times isnt much, but you should definitely be feeling it after your second or third time."
saplings,384w6y,Afrew,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:37:33 2015 UTC,"It largely depends on the size of the bowl on the pipe/piece itself, but I'd say the standard ""amount of hits"" for a normal bowl is around 20, give or take a couple. My friend takes decently big hits on his pipe and still gets around 20 hits overall, whereas I take slightly smaller hits and my bowl gets closer to 24.  Cornering really helps if you are trying to use a bowl as efficiently as possible. Cornering is when you engage the lighter, and bring it as close as you can to the bud on the edge of the bowl without touching the flame to it. This way, you only smoke the parts of the bowl that are actually glowing embers. If you just put the flame directly into the middle of the bowl, you end up scorching and incinerating a lot of the weed before you even start to actually inhale it."

saplings,386bgm,soxxfan105,3,Tue Jun 2 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"Don't spray perfume. Everyone secretly hates how it smells and it doesn't help in any real way. Turn on your fan after smoking. The goal here is not to have the fan suck up any air so you can effectively blow your smoke out the window. When the fan is on and your window is open, you'll probably have full air exchange in the room in half an hour. Any longer, especially since you're already blowing smoke out the window is overkill. Just keep your stash in a mason jar. As far as your piece, I wouldn't worry much about letting it sit on your window sill or whatever ritual you do, pipes just don't smell all that much unless it's gunked with tar and ash."

And point it out the window so it blows all of the smoke out of the room. Just smoke by the fan and it will blow out all the smoke. And buy some ""ozium"" it's the best air purifying spay. It's what they use in hospitals. You should be cool if you do all that."

It either hardly smells at all, or doesn't smell at all, and the smell never sneaks out of the room and reaches the main room."

When I was 15-18 I had to buy off low level dealers who would pretty much made up strains etc just to sell off the ten bags they're selling. Most days it would be a very spur of the moment thing which made shopping around hard. If it was good I didn't really care. Plus i've found that the better dealers who are really passionate about weed don't like to sell to kids for moral and risk reasons.   Now I'm 23 and have a job so I can afford to buy by the ounce and shop around in advance for the best weed/deal.   And I agree you're looking into it too much for someone who has smoked six times. Legal states have made people chase the unreal stuff which is gonna be hard to come by in most other places without paying a lot and knowing the right people.

Tolerance however has been shown that anything after two weeks is essentially a waste of tolerance reduction. This should also take into consideration different body types and metabolisms of course.
saplings,381tm7,Cobalt_97,7,Wed Jun 3 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"Tdlr; it varies upon strain, amount, body fat, metabolism, diet etc..  With this being reddit, only the most thoroughly scientifically researched and US govt sanctioned and approved tests would qualify as accurate. But lets remember the Feds literally spend all of their time spending our tax dollars lying to us, especially about Cannabis.  Now that I got that out of my system!  Lets discuss factors that play apart. Most of the comments I've seen quote the 'time it takes to get pot out of my system for a Drug test', theory.  Im making the assumption, that OP is smoking some "" pineapple express"", and has started to not get the same relief as they have become accustomed too. So OP wants to clear his system so he can have that special feeling again.  The difference being that OP could have been smoking strain A, built a tolerence and no longer felt the same, but smoked strain B and felt the effects of strain B.  Every strain, and plant (genetics and grow environment) is going to have a different level of cannabinoid count (%wise).  Because different cannbinoids impact our bodies differently, we also need to look at things like body fat, metabolism and diet. A person who drinks only water vs a person who drinks only soda... For reddit this should be obvious.  So in assuming you just want to have that fresh hit of pineapple express again... Stop being a DAB douche, or someone that smokes like a rapper (like me :)  If you dont abuse it, it will always work for you when you need it."

If you use Sulak's techniques frequently for long enough, you will find yourself needing less and less to get high/medicated. It's a technique that takes some patience and dedication though and is not something you should expect instant results from. It's more guidelines to improve on how you use cannabis and how you experience it's benefits."

When you only smoke one or two times a week your tolerance remains pretty low.

saplings,381tm7,IJOY94,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"It depends. I find there are 2 types of tolerances :  A) Physical tolerance (as in the THC is still in your body so you must flush it in order to remove it)  B) Mental tolerance (as in, what to expect when smoking a certain amount of weed, are you feeling well, are you tired or stressed, have you eaten, etc.)  The mental part also comes into play if, let's imagine you smoked a 1 gram joint of good weed with your friend and went into a 10. If you do it again with your physical tolerance lowered, you will still get high, or maybe even higher, but you will know what to expect and therefore will not panic or whatever.  I find that both are interconnected in some way, because if one is high and the other low, you will get stoned in a different way. I get way higher if I haven't eaten, or I get way too stoned and sleepy if I'm tired.   Jogging helps A LOT. Try jogging for a week each day and you will find your tolerance will be almost reset. (provided you are slim ofc, THC stores itself in fat)"
saplings,381tm7,SnakeHelah,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:10:35 2015 UTC,I assume by physical tolerance you're referring to the pain relieving properties of the strain?

Is there any legitimacy behind the difference tolerances?
saplings,381tm7,abarbee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:52:19 2015 UTC,I started running because I heard that exercise would help keep your tolerance down. When I smoked for the first time after two days of running I could tell a difference. Not a crazy powerful high but it was better
saplings,382c4p,deepfriedsyrup,12,Mon Jun 1 10:16:58 2015 UTC,Most if not all strains will get you high. I wouldn't worry about the strain so much. In my opinion I think most dealers/ middle man make up the name of the strain just to make it sound better.

To be completely honest with you, the strain has such little relation to what the high is like (other than the difference between indica and sativa) that you really shouldn't be picky about that sort of thing unless you're a med. marijuana patient who has many choices readily available to them."

How the bud is grown/cured determines the quality. A well-grown batch of ""Silver Haze"" (just for example) will be much better than a poorly-grown batch of silver haze. The strain really doesn't matter when it comes to quality. You should be paying more attention to what the bud looks like, how it smells, and its dryness/other factors like that."

Just make sure you arent getting charged a premium for the ""premium strain"""
saplings,382c4p,IAmA_TheOneWhoKnocks,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:45:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, i never ever ever trust strain names unless you are getting it directly from the grower (or dispensaries, once that's a thing in my area). The bud has to move between several people before it gets to you, and the chances are likely that someone in the line gave it a hardcore bud name just so they can charge more.  On top of this, people put a LOT of focus on the importance of strain, but in actuality, the strain is not the sole determining factor in the intensity and quality of the high produced. In fact the way in which it is grown is the most important factor in determining quality. I could buy a bag of nameless brick weed, take a seed out of that, and grow it with lots of TLC and perfect balances of nutrients and fertilizer and optimized light cycles, and i guarantee you it will turn out better than a purchased White Widow seed that was not optimally cared for. The only thing you could really get out of knowing the strain name is knowing a rough estimation of the Indica/Sativa ratio, and again, thats only if you're being told the true strain name.  As such, I never rely on names as a means to determine quality. to side-step this, i try to never buy without smoking some of what he's selling AT the guy's house. I'll use that smoke sesh to determine quality. If i think i'm being overcharged or the product is not as advertised, i'll bring it up. My guy is very friendly and is usually willing to at least discuss a ""i'll give you a little extra in the next batch"" deal or something.  Also note that your dealer(s) are subject to availability in the area. Sometimes finding good bud is really difficult. You can't always blame inconsistent quality on the dealer himself because there are a lot of factors involved, many of which are out of his control. If you're really concerned about it, ask him to let you know when he has the good good."

Nothing wrong with that but nothing is stopping him from making up names.   Should i start to be ""picky"" and only buy from him when he has the good shit?    Of course, you are the customer, you are always right. You are buying a product with your hard earned money, if you don't like what he is selling, dont buy it, set the standard of quality you are willing to accept. You dont have to throw it in his face, be real cool and just mention you didnt like how it looks can you get me something better, im willing to pay for higher quailty.

If you are under 18, be prepared to potentially quit until you are legally able to continue smoking, because it's never the best idea to smoke if you are still a minor and your parents are totally against it. They have the control at that point in your life, and that's something you would have to live with.  But I'm sure it will be fine, so good  luck and happy tokes!"

The weed smell would be completely gone within a couple hours if you smoked inside, and will be completely non-existent if you do it outside. The only thing I would be worried about is the weed sticking to you/your clothes. The house is nothing to worry about. Happy toking, and enjoy your first time!  Edit: If you're super worried about the smell, (and for future reference) Ozium is pretty much the best thing to completely eliminate the smell. Just be careful when you spray it, it's not meant to be inhaled and isn't healthy."

saplings,381vic,IAmA_TheOneWhoKnocks,3,Tue Jun 2 04:44:03 2015 UTC,Joint usually use more bud but are  very moble. I love rolling some jays and taking them out on the go. Joints are also good for social situations.   I think that the biggest advantage to a pipe is the fact that it has a bowl so you can make your weed last longer by using less.  I enjoy joints because imo they are relaxing and you dont have to keep refilling and fumbling w a lighter
saplings,381vic,deathbypolkadots,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:44:42 2015 UTC,"I much prefer bowls because they use less bud and I don't feel pressured to smoke quickly like I do with a j that is constantly burning.

saplings,37zrib,iCEBERGJODY,1 point,Sun May 31 20:26:34 2015 UTC,They aren't air tight. Thats the problem I would have. Being airtight serves more purpose than just keeping the smell down. It also serves to further cure the marijuana making for a smoother smoke in the long run.   Any reason why you don't just invest in glass containers? Mason jars are essentially perfect and you can get them in 4oz if you want them small.

If you only need a temporary solution, maybe find two containers, one of which fits inside the other with some space, and then fill the space with either dryer sheets or some odor neutralizer. I don't recommend keeping the weed around dryer sheets for too long though, so maybe consider forgoing those and opting to store it somewhere safe outside, like a shed or something."

You have your whole life to get stoned. Just listen to your parents and try to understand that they only have your best interest in mind.

You can find decent weed in any city in Europe, just have to look for the right guys and trust your gut, if this guy is sketchy don't trust him. As for the police matters, before going out to find some loud, google the country's police activity towards weed (Police homepage/Laws/ News articles of major drug bust) - do this if reaaaaally paranoid, otherwise not worth the hustle for a dimebag in each country.

This way the flame goes directly down and doesn't get a chance to burn you. The actual way you hold the lighter doesn't really matter much IMO.

saplings,37xuee,PhD_in_internet,2,Sun May 31 16:29:20 2015 UTC,I put my mouth to the bowl take the lighter hold it so that the flater side is against my fingers and the tips of my fingers just keep it still hold the lighter so the sparky and gassy bits are on the side farthest from the bowl hold the lighter straight up and light it start sucking in and move the lighter in a slight arc and a light twist so the palm of my hand is at like a 45 degree angle and the let off the gas before i stop inhaling. the speed you move your hand plays a big part and make sure you inhale as you turn your hand so the fire goes down into the weed rather than up and burn you.

saplings,37xyrb,dendra_,4,Sun May 31 09:40:39 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about getting too high or not enjoying it, take a hit or two, wait 10-15 minutes, and then decide if you should smoke more. Start slow and gague it from there. And then if you start smoking more you can experiment with different staring to find out what you like and what you don't. But if you take it slow when you first start you'll be less likely to get too high and have a bad time."

Our lungs are very efficient and most of the THC will be exchanged in less than a second. Also holding it in your mouth will do nothing, you need to hold it in your lungs for the added effect.

Like I'm not saying it's not gonna be hot, but if you're having trouble inhaling properly because the smoke is irritating your throat, holding the smoke in your mouth for a few seconds and then breathing in some air should make sure the smoke gets to your lungs.   Also some people will say to hold your hit for as long as you can, but anything more than a few seconds is unnecessary because the THC is absorbed after a few seconds.   If you have any other questions just ask! I'd be glad to help with whatever I can!"

Of course they exist, but I think in most cases the environment has more to do with it than the weed itself. Everytime I've gotten paranoid or freaked out, it's because I was in an environment where I felt less than comfortable. We are not talking acid here, but set and setting are important to consider with any drug, especially if you are a newcomer.   Also, use common sense. If the weed is strong, smoke less. Don't be a hero and start slow to find out just how strong it is. Much like you wouldn't drink vodka at the same rate and amounts you would drink light beer, you also wouldn't smoke skunk the same way that you would smoke bushweed."

I've got a little bong that doesn't get a ton of use, but is still nice to have around. Idk how much money you've got, or if you're going for a artsy piece, but I've got a Roll-uh-bowl (www.roll-uh-bowl.com). It's only $35, if you play your cards right you might be able to get both.  I've got an MFLB. At about $80, it's hard to get anything better. Nothing less than $80 seems to be a ""true vape"" and they all appear to be a universal pain in the ass. Definitely check out vaporents, but I highly recommend the MLFB  Edit: realized I didn't answer the question really.   Pros of vape Can be super stealthy. Vapor doesn't smell like smoke, which is nice. Depending on your vape, it can be almost completely inconspicuous. Weed efficient. It uses less in the trench/oven/""bowl"" and the vaped bud can be saved and eaten, or smoked If you're desperate.  U will get v high.   Cons Some people complain about the high, but I don't find it any different than a smoking high.  Pros of bong Big, smooth hits.  Can look really nice (expensiiiiiive) but they can be true art pieces.    Cons Idk man I'm too high to do this anymore"

If you use weed to get doped up and enjoy being a drooling [10] all the time, then after a while weed will probably not fuel you anymore and your tolerance is gonna be sky-high.

saplings,37tobt,SnakeHelah,7,Mon Jun 1 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"Weed will definately increase your interest in psychodelics as well, luckily those(lsd, mushrooms) are anti addictive since they are significantly less effective the more often you take them.  That being said, unless your dealer also deals in harder drugs you shouldn't really have a connection or interest to other drugs as a result of weed."

saplings,37tobt,djgucci,7,Sat May 30 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience, while I have tried acid and shrooms after using weed for a while, it's not like you ""move on"" to acid and shrooms. You use weed on a regular basis, and acid or shrooms every once in a while if you want to get some introspection. Neither of those drugs are at all how they're depicted in movies though, and most people who have experimented with them put the experience in their top 5 most significant life experiences. Shrooms helped me accept myself for who I am. But to answer your question, weed is only a gateway drug in that it introduces you to people who may have access to other drugs. You are the ultimate deciding factor in what drugs you experiment with."
saplings,37tobt,Groosed,8,Sat May 30 15:23:50 2015 UTC,The only reasonable way I can think of weed being a gateway drug is that your dealer also deals with harder things and wants to make money by having you buy those as well..
saplings,37tobt,Elvelution,5,Sat May 30 09:19:44 2015 UTC,"Because of marijuana prohibition, when I first started smoking the only way I could get weed was through the kids in my school who were a bit off the track. So I started smoking with them. These guys went out, drank a lot and took harder drugs. At first, I wouldn't smoke tobacco only weed, I started smoking half cigarettes with them so that was me hooked on those.   Fast forward a bit, these guys are my best friends now as the perception I gathered from school was such because they simply hated school. The social structure of it, long story.   Anyway, when these guys go out they take pills, coke, etc. I've done these things as well now, not because I wanted something ""bigger"" than weed, but because I wanted to see what the fuss was. In fact, if i didnt smoke weed i can guarentee id be out every other weekend, taking MDMA/Coke which is cut with whatever the fuck else but a year ago I'd have never imagined it, and I really dont regret it as I've seen it as a mind expanding experience.  Anyway, I've rambled horribly [7] but TLDR I'd say gateways are a product of prohibition. It would be a lot harder to initially find hard drugs if you effectively didn't have to deal with criminals every time you pick up."

saplings,37tobt,tannerpending2113,1 point,Sun May 31 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"Weed was the first drug I'd ever done (including alcohol and tobacco) and even though I use other drugs now too, I don't consider weed to have been what caused me to want to try other drugs. Hell I had wanted to try acid since I learned about it in 7th grade health class; way before I had even considered smoking weed. Even if weed was the gateway to me using psychedelics and dabbling in prescription pills, the only reason it was a gateway was because of the way schools teach kids about drugs. When I got into high school and started to actually do my research on things that I didn't know a ton about I found out that weed was the safest drug there is. I figured that maybe I had been fed propaganda about drugs all my childhood. I thought ""if they lied about weed, what would stop them from lying about other drugs?"" So I did my own research and learned that a lot of the stuff my teachers told me about drugs was either a half truth or a complete lie. So I don't think weed is a gateway drug; it's the War on Drugs propaganda that's been spread for the past few decades that leads kids to experimenting with other drugs. There will always be people that abuse drugs, but if we work on teaching people the risks and some major changes to the Controlled Substances Act, I feel like there would be less problems with drug addiction and crime. It would open the door for tons of scientific research and maybe we'll discover that some of the drugs that are illegal could actually be used to help treat diseases such as depression. There's so many possibilities that we have the chance to discover, but it's nearly impossible with the stigma that 'hard' drugs have and with the government doing everything it can to keep drugs banned."

saplings,37vucj,SykeSwipe,1 point,Sat May 30 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"Bubblers and bowls hit about the same. Used to smoke out of my bowl exclusively. Then I got ""bored"" I guess and switched to joints/blunts. They use more weed, rather wasteful, but the act of actually smoking (like one would a cigarette) soothes me. I used to think blunts got me higher, but that isn't the case anymore.  Bongs can do some damage, definitely. I've got a lil 8"" bong and it's very effective, though I don't use her as much as I'd like.  I got an MFLB about 2 months ago. Big fan. The high it's self isn't much different than smoking, I feel a little less lethargic but that's it. I love the MLFB because it uses so little weed, which is a huge plus to this broke college stoner. Which piece I pick to use is all a matter of situation and mood. If I'm with a couple of people, we usually pass around a couple of bowls or blunts. If I'm by myself, I've noticed that I've started using my vape more and more. That being said, I just rolled a beautiful, solo blunt and can't wait to burn it down.  Bud is bud is bud I guess!

You reach your peak high quickly but that high will fade more quickly. In other words, you may feel you go from [0] to [7] to [2] pretty quickly. Consumption methods that force you to dose more slowly over time like vaporizers and blunts, you won't reach a strong peak high but you'll have a useful dose of thc in your system for longer. In other words you may go from a [0] to a [4] slowly and feel like you're cruising there.

Back to the economies of scale. If you were to purchase an ounce, 28.3g, you'd probably expect to pay about $560 if you're going by $20/g. But, when getting larger quantities, expect to pay much less. The most I've paid is $380 for an ounce but that quality was on point. The lowest I've paid is $260 for some mids.

saplings,37s85n,BullettLeMans,2,Sun May 31 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Combustion obviously causes smoke, which is the primary cause of lung cancer and other various respiratory disorders. These respiratory problems are simply by-products of smoke, and have nothing to do with the plant itself. You smoke marijuana to release cannabinoids on the plant, but there are other ways to ingest the things you want without smoking. Although not the best, vaporizing marijuana can rid you of a large percentage of the smoke and carcinogens that come from smoke. Bongs are generally better as they do trap some heavier particles and other water-soluble molecules in the water, preventing it from entering your airways, but you can also make edibles or even take pills if you really are that concerned. Commonly smoking is related to lung cancer with cigarettes, which people smoke tons of on a regular basis. I am not saying that smoke isn't bad for you, but compared to how much smoke you inhale from smoking a little bit of weed a few nights a week to that of a regular smoker, the difference is huge. Everyone is different, but people like Tommy Chong and Snoop Dogg have been smoking for their entire lives and they are fine. Granted it might be different for you and this isn't reason to just up and do it, but to answer your question very basically yes and no.   TL;DR - Yes, smoking from a water bottle bong or any other form of smoke will cause harm due to the carcinogenic properties of smoke, not anything to do with the plant itself. Smoking from a bong is generally better as it does trap some heavier particles and other water-soluble molecules in the water, preventing it from entering your airways. Safer ways include vaping and edibles, but compared to how much cigarette smokers smoke, smoking weed every once and a while won't hurt you nearly as much. Purchase a real piece or roll a joint and you should be much better off.  Sources:    Wikipedia  The Smokers Club  Erowid   Note - If you are referring to the fact that it is made of plastic, I am sorry for my lengthy and not needed reply, but I hope it helped as much as it could. I honestly have no clue as to the whole idea of it, but I would think that the combustion of marijuana is no where near hot enough to melt the plastic or release anything bad for you, but I would do a simple Google search to find out first.*"

Of you want to make a DIY bong, there are hundreds of tutorials on YouTube and you can get some ideas over at /r/stonerengineering   Heating up plastic can release carcinogens and inhaling that is in no way good for your lungs. Sure, you can use a metal tube and socket as a down stem, but when it comes to your lungs and smoking, it's best to keep the risks of cancer and other pulmonary disease to a minimum. Use glass bottles, or save 30 bucks and buy one at smoke shop."

saplings,37q6h9,cazzmatazz,5,Fri May 29 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"This is Old Hippie's recipe for Firecrackers. If you follow the recipe exactly as it says, there's no way you can fail. Old Hippie's Firecrackers are the easiest, quickest, most efficient, and most beginner-friendly way to make a good, sturdy, rudimentary edible.  A couple months ago or so, I tried the recipe for the first time to see if it would work. I invited a good buddy of mine over, and we each had half of it. About 45 minutes later, we started to get real high. For the next 3 or 4 hours, we were beyond stoned, and didn't come down at all until after that last hour. You know how when you smoke you can feel your high kind of going up and down in waves? Well with these Firecrackers it's the same thing, except the wave doesn't really come down at all, it just keeps swinging upwards, lol.  I made another one and ate half of it for 4/20. After maybe an hour and a half after the high started, all I could do was lie on my couch with the room dark and my headphones on. Shit was incredible, and I'm not exaggerating: After swaddling myself in my comfiest sweatpants, drug-rug, and big comforter-blanket, I felt as if I was literally the only thing in the universe. Just me and my music.  The normal ""high scale"" goes from [1] to [10], but I prefer to think of 1 - 10 as stages where you are stoned, but still ""conscious"" (for lack of a better term) in that you know where you are, what you are doing, who you are, you can more or less think properly (albeit slower), etc. The stages that go from [11] - [18] are for edibles and hardcore vaporizing, where you are so high that you start to lose a grip on yourself and cannot create or process coherent thoughts. Half of a Firecracker will easily put you at, I'd say, a [13] or [14].   If you've never made edibles before I highly recommend these. The winning factors about Firecrackers (especially Old Hippie's recipe) is that you hardly need any weed at all, and you don't have to decarboxylate anything beforehand. Give them a shot! I highly doubt you will regret it."

Make sure to decarb, and to leave it in the oil long enough.  If you vape, save up some ABV, and use that, that way you sure don't waste any weed... with a little bit of abv you can make awesome firecrackers!  The high is different from smoking or vaping, but not a lot. To me, it feels more relaxing, and I tend to forget less stuff. Also, it's a lot longer, everything lasts longer. For me personally, it is easier to get slight hallucinations with edibles, but that's not true for everybody."

The swat team raided him, shot his dog dead, and found nothing more than a pipe and a misdemeanor quantity of pot in his house.  I own my house, nobody else lives there, and I am not a dealer.

Besides, that would be a lot of work just to catch some goofy doober sparking up a bowl.  Anywho, whenever I'm done smoking, I always dump the ash into the toilet. It hasn't failed to flush ever, and you don't have to deal with any lingering scent. I do the same with any roaches I may have too, because those tend to reek a bit more.  Whenever I clean my pipe or bong, I always use isopropyl alcohol, which also tends to warp the scent significantly into something that doesn't even smell like resin or buildup. I then dump the scuzzy junk into the toilet and flush it, or slowly into the sink while hot water is running.  Word to the wise, you may want to stop smoking though.

saplings,37qr61,Rastles,1 point,Fri May 29 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"If you could boil it first (for 3 minutes) or use fresh water I would. There is likely not an extreme risk, but keep in mind even if you don't get tastable droplets in your mouth you will still be inhaling an aerosol of marijuana smoke and water. Bacteria and other microbes are light enough to be lifted with this aerosol, and into your lungs.  So my feeling is, if you absolutely have no way of purifying it or getting fresh water, then I think you'd be fine to do it a few times (but not regularly). However only use lake water obtained at least 10 feet from shore as water close to shore is the dirtiest."
saplings,37qr61,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Fri May 29 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"I would never do it at all. I've been backpacking scores of times and every time I've gone, I've heard horror stories from old dudes about how when they didn't pay attention and purify/sterilize water properly, they get terrible intestinal and stomach troubles.  Horror stories aside, it's just plain not smart. Even if you sterilize the water by boiling it, there really isn't an absolute, 100%, certain guarantee that the water is still safe to consume. Can you take the risk and be okay? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, absolutely, but some microbes can screw you up regardless.  Also, even if you didn't actually consume your bong water, and even if none of it got in your mouth, you are still doing something incredibly risky by breathing in the vapor. The condition isn't common at all, and really only affects people with already compromised or weakened immune systems, but there is an amoeba that only infects you when you inhale the water it is carried in. Even if you can't feel it or see it, the smoke from a bong is carrying water vapor within it. Aside from this crazy amoeba, you have to figure that sterilizing/purifying water doesn't remove all of the tiny debris inside of it. You can eat dirt, feces, raw plant matter, hell, even forms of mercury, but can you inhale any of those? Not unless you want to kill your lungs you can't.  As I said, the chances of anything detrimental happening from you using purified/sterilized lake water for your bong are pretty damn slim, but I certainly wouldn't be okay with taking the risk. It'd be far easier to just bring a fresh bottle of water from home and have it be dedicated for your bong."

The first time I smoked was because my friends told me that both drugs' effects combine very well. After smoking+using acid combo, my way of logical thought would change, but not to something worse, only different, for maybe a week. I didn't use too regularly, because of the common risks involved (getting caught, for example). I can say this experiences have broadened my way of thinking forever, in a positive way, but then again, I'm not a ""heavy user""."

saplings,37nxts,SR_TEXAS,2,Fri May 29 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"To preface, the human brain, specifically the frontal lobe, which controls emotions, manners, voluntary thought processes, problem solving, some memory, etc., completely finishes developing at the age of 24, so irresponsible use of any substance before then has the potentiality of stunting or hindering that development.   Anywho, I first started smoking when I was 19, almost 20, but did it only very occasionally. Then, once I had the opportunity to buy my own stuff, I smoked once every 2 or 3 weeks.  About 6 months ago, pretty close to when I turned 21, I've started smoking once per week, and I've noticed that my short-term memory has gotten slightly worse, and I sometimes say things I don't necessarily mean to (nothing bad, just ""Wait, that didn't further the discussion at all"" kinds of things), or form sentences improperly. I also notice that I'm having a hard time with the ""tip of my tongue"" effect, where I'll try to say a word, but I just can't remember what that word is. I've always had a slight problem with occasional stuttering and ""tip of the tongue"", but it's a bit worse now.  My thought processes are a bit different now too. I find it harder to solve math problems in my head, which I used to be very good at doing, but I now have a more ""bigger picture"" view of many things, so I consider that a good trade-off.   Alright, I'm not as good at typing as I used to be, I'm just finding out. I used to be really excellent and hardly made any errors, and if I did I would see them and correct them immediately."

And I agree with what you said about weed not being addicting at first ""but after a while it becomes so habitual to smoke a bowl"" before anything for me really because I smoke before work, before school, before bed, I smoke as much as I can lol.

Even after several years I don't feel as though it's had any substantial long term effect, besides minor lung irritation. Cognitively, I notice no difference. I still have the same wit, attention span, ability to reason and deduce, and eloquence of speech. Sometimes I feel cloudy when I'm high or when I've been smoking a lot that week, but given enough time to recover I always get right back to normal. It's all very short term for me, barring some lung irritation like I said, which is really not a big deal, I just cough a bit more than I used to, and even this went away after the few times that I took relatively short tolerance breaks.  I smoked every day before high school my senior year of high school and almost all my junior year. Looking back it was not a good idea to smoke as much as I did based solely on productivity, but I don't regret anything and I would do it again. I got good grades in high school, did well on all my tests, got accepted to university. I do well there too, still smoking as much, and I'm now a medical marijuana patient.

I've gotten it both cheaper and more expensive, but it depends heavily on region.  As long as you're cool and ""professional"" then you'll be fine. Avoid using weed terms in text messages, some dealers are weird about security (as well they should be I guess) but until you're on better terms with your dealer, avoid words like ""bud"" or ""[insert amount here] grams""  When you go pick up, if you haven't already talked about how much you're buying, then it's as easy as meeting someone for the first time. ""Hi, I'm so and so, this is blah blah blah"" chit chat for a few minutes and then when the conversation shifts to being bud related, just tell your dealer how much you want and they'll tell you how much it'll cost. If you don't know how much you want, here is a lil list.  10/gram is average. 1 gram is generally the smallest amount to buy. 35(great deal) to $60 (too expensive generally but if it's your only option, not horrific) for an 8th. That's 3.5g, most people seem to pick up in 8ths if they're just an evening/weekend toker. I've been paying anywhere from 70-90 for a quarter, which is 7g or 1/4 of an ounce   Don't pick up more than a quarter for your first time, and a lot of dealers offer ""discounts"" if you buy in bulk. I've also found that my personal dealer gives me more bud if I say ""I've got $60"" versus me saying ""can I pick up 5 grams?"" But that'll vary from person to person.  Boom.

Inhale a comfortable amount, but don't try to fill your lungs 100%. Pull your mouth from whatever you're smoking from and suck down a bit more air. Don't gulp, you're not trying to swallow air, just inhale it. Exhale as slowly as you can.

The dose he recommends were actually a bit too much for me using ABV, but if you start with half a cracker or so, you should be fine. And make sure to mix it in with the peanut butter instead of just putting it on top, that works a bit better for the absorption part.  If you use weed that hasn't been vaped or something like that, you need to decarboxylate it first, there's lots of guides on how to do that online.  Mix it with peanut butter if you can. For me, it didn't really taste weird, and peanut butter has a lot more fat the thc can bind to than nutella. The more fat, the better.  It is possible to microwave firecrackers (or PB sandwiches, that's what I see the most), but please leave out the foil if you decide to do this! It would work the exact same way as it would in an oven, but you probably have to play with the time settings a bit before you get the best results."

In OldHippie's guide, he doesn't specifically say to decarb the bud before I make it if I'm using unvaped weed. Would it still work just using that?"
saplings,37mqdh,oHDGx,1 point,Fri May 29 00:06:19 2015 UTC,Tried OldHippie's guide like 4 times and didn't get high once (unless it kicked in when I went to sleep idk)  Used AVB 1st time (is already decarbed) and (undecarbed) bud the rest. The 4th time I used a pretty generous amount and still nothing  My (smoking) tolerance was and still is waaaaay too high but I've never been high from edibles.  Afaik your smoking tolerance doesn't affect edible tolerance but it probably does since you have an excess amount of cannabinoids in your body from smoking compared to only having the cannabinoids produced naturally by your body
saplings,37mqdh,AwesomeDaveSome,1 point,Fri May 29 04:08:46 2015 UTC,"Also, I might be wrong on this, but THC binds to fat, so more fat would equal to getting higher, Right? If that is the case, the peanut butter has only 2g more fat in it, so it would work better. My question is how much better would it work because I find that Nutella tastes way better to me than peanut butter does and if it's not too huge of a difference, I'm going to use the Nutella."

saplings,37jjkn,DOMinant_Allele,3,Fri May 29 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on flushing, or growing, but I am knowledgeable about combustion and pyrolysis, since that is what I study, so I can tell you that if by flushing you mean that there was fertilizer still in the plant then it definitely would not effect the color of the ash produced.  First of all, the plant only absorbs nutrients in a very basic form, so you don't have to worry about complex molecules like ammonium nitrate being in the weed.    Secondly, if you're worried about excess nutrients like elemental nitrogen or potassium, you're not going to be able to tell from the ash.  During combustion all the atoms present in the plant matter are broken from their structures and turned into tars and gasses which then usually combust and rebond into gaseous forms.  The atoms that don't do that are typically inert or too heavy to volatilize (turn into gaseous states or molecules at room temp.).  Things like carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are present in all organic matter will either volatilize or rebond into an organic slag (tar) if there isn't enough heat or oxygen to sustain the reaction.    If you continue to torch the bowl and chief it down, those tars will eventually all be volatilized, with the exception of trace minerals like potassium and iron, which will be left behind.  This is called mineral ash, and it makes up a very small percentage of the overall plant. It is the white ash that you speak of.  Black ash still has tars and chars which only means that it has not been completely combusted to the fullest extent.  So, in short, the color of of your ash is determined more by how well you burn it than the state of the plant beforehand.  If anything, black resin (not ash) around your bowl is an indicator that your bud was more bomb than bud that did not leave as much resin behind.  The reason for this is that the resin is mainly THC, CBD, and other chemicals, which we like from the trichomes.  Which has melted under the heat of your flame and stuck to the sides rather than being vaporized and their sweet, sweet goodness inhaled.  Stuck in that sticky mess are char particles, which are mostly harmless, but give the resin a black color, rather than a nice tan or golden color.  The reason it tastes so gross is that there aren't as many yummy terpenoids in it that give weed it's flavor.  Here is what some of the char particles can look like on a molecular level, they're mostly carbon and oxygen.  Here is what tar particles look like under an electron microscope.  The reason they are harmful is that they can float through the air in tiny globules which can get into your lungs and clog them up.  tl:dr, the color of the ash matters not."

But that's not the point, it's about keeping your ass safe because scummy people do want what you have or want to hurt you.   If you don't feel safe, why do it? It's not worth getting mugged, beat up, or worse. My #1 rule is never enter a new drug dealer's car alone and never let anyone go in alone.   Visit the store more often if you're interested, chat with the guy and get a feel for his vibes. He could be a stand-up dude, you never know! If he doesn't work out, you'll find someone soon enough and probably for cheaper!"

He comes back and gives you weed. You pay him, done deal.  Lets say he insists you give him $20 before he leaves (not ideal), he can either bounce and you never see your $20 again or he comes back with a gram.  .... I mean that or he can come back with the DEA and arrest you."

Joints/blunts are a breeze, but lighting a bowl with it can take some practice, especially if it's windy, the flame will be less easily blown out, but will ""wobble"" around more. This is because it uses lighter fluid instead of pressurized fuel, like a bic or something, which means the flame also has less of a tenancy to shoot down into your bowl, if that makes any sense. I can provide further clarification if need be. Happy toking!"

You should also try to make sure the material is roughly the correct shape of the joint before you lick it shut.   It also looks like you didn't keep the paper under tension while rolling it shut. This gives the paper a lot of room to form folds and such and it probably never will get that tight joint look. When closing the joint, make sure not let go of the bottom end of the paper. One end should be held firmly on the filter. Your other hand should be pulling on the rest of the bottom end of the paper (or at least part of it, depending on your personal preference).  Hope i made any sense. Willing to clear up unclear bits."

In this post you are clearly stating that you feel the need to be hidden.  Trying out trees for the first time by yourself while already being concerned about being caught has a high chance of leading you to either not experience anything (combination of first-timers tolerance and anxiety driven adrenaline) or to have a rather paranoid experience.  Have you thought about talking to your parents first?  Is there any chance they would be accepting?  What about going to a friends house or other place you already are comfortable with?  If you are not ready to talk to your parents, maybe you should be spending more time finding a way to move out instead of worrying about your first time.  Trees aren't going anywhere...they can wait.  If you still want to go on with your plan, then like others have said, bring water and some chill tunes...and if at all possible, bring a baby-sitter (someone who is already experienced with trees and can help keep you in a happy place)."

It could be possible that you are still high. First source that popped up on Google for ""Lavender"" was this and it says the potency is 10/10 so that could be it.  Otherwise it always could have been laced.  Try telling your friend about how you're feeling."
saplings,37ezw3,TokerDokers,1 point,Wed May 27 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help. The 3 grams was the first time, which was a few months ago. On saturday my friend and I only smoked 2 bowls worth, which wasn't a lot. We also shared the second bowl with another friend so it was even less. My friend's cousin is the one who sells it to him, he usually sells it to him for half price because he's nice and gets really good deals, but he said he had to charge full price for the stuff we had ""lavender"" because it was so good.  I don't think it was laced. Every other time I have smoked or he has smoked its been from the same person, and neither of us have ever had a reaction like this.  When I ask him how he feels he says every couple hours he feels a little high but I think that may just be him trying to convince me i'm alright. On saturday when we got high, it felt like every other time i've been high, and my friend said the same thing."

Driving while high is no more different than driving and drinking a soda to some people. I daresay most of the smokers I know outside of reddit smoke and drive. Reddit is the only place I really see the act criticized.   Like all substances, it really depends on the person, if you've smoked a stupid amount of weed, then yeah, you're definitely fucking up, but if it's just a little then it's no big deal.

saplings,37bdam,Zeds_dead,15,Tue May 26 11:17:41 2015 UTC,"They are more efficient with your herb. While I don't have any scientific article right now to back it up, I hope my logic and poor English can help get my vision across.   The temperature at which the good stuff(thc and cbd being the most known)  in weed comes out at around 200c. There are plenty of charts that show you which element is released at which temperature. The material needs time to heat up in order to release the elements we want.   When you combust you heat the herb to very high temperatures. The herb releases a good part of the elements we like (and some we don't, due too these temperatures such as ash and tar) but it also combusts some of the herb before it has had enough time to heat and  release the goody element. Like the thca didn't get enough time to convert into thc.   Most vaporizers collect residu somewhere. You can harvest this and make hash out of it, or dissolve it in hot chocolate and get high that way.   Another point why vaporizers are more efficient with mj would be the already vaped bud. The weed you used to vape doesn't turn to ash, but it stays somewhat the same. Depending on how long and how hot you vape, some thc or cbd probably is still in there. And there probably is little thca left. The weed is decarbed. You can use this weed to make edibles. Giving your weed a second life and yourself a second high.   I love my vaporizer, I like vaping. Yet the same is still true for combustion. I like my joints and I like smoking. Yet I do believe that .5g in a joint will get me pretty high, but .5g in my vaporizer gets me to a level where I will start to doubt if I'm still comfortable.   Hope it made sense. Sorry I don't offer any true science."
saplings,37bdam,spoetnick,2,Tue May 26 11:54:45 2015 UTC,Couldn't have worded it better myself. It's not a question of whether or not it's more efficient. It should be a question of whether it's worth the money to buy a decent vaporizer.
saplings,37bdam,Baked_Bacon_420,3,Tue May 26 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"Aside from the efficiencies of combustion vs. vaporization, there are other factors that make vaporizers more efficient. The materials that I clean out of my bong are ash - which is of no further use - and resin - which has some cannabinoids, but is mostly just the tar from the plant material. When I clean my vape, however, I get ABV which can be smoked or eaten, and concentrated hash oil.  So, with combustion you put in weed and get out garbage. With a vape you put in weed and get out two other drugs.   Edit: and as for the inefficiency of combustion, when cannabinoids are heated beyond their vaporization points a process called pyrolysis occurs which degrade and break down the THC and other molecules that you want inside of you. By only heating to the vape point, then you get all of the goodies that you're looking for."
saplings,37bdam,Perisphere,2,Tue May 26 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"It's similar to how an electric car is more efficient with it's fuel than a traditional gas motor. In the sense that less power (weed/THC/CBD) is lost to high heat. Of course it's not a perfect metaphor, but it's at least worth mulling over."

You shouldn't feel like he's pressuring you into it and you shouldn't feel pressured into accepting his offer. Also you're still pretty young to be smoking so I would suggest waiting a few years and then striking up that conversation with your father again to see if your perspective has changed. [5]
saplings,37a61l,thespiner,9,Tue May 26 03:48:59 2015 UTC,"That was rather helpful, but I know he has a half stashed somewhere not being smoked, but he said he smokes like once a month or so, and I definitely will start later, that's for sure."

If you are unfamiliar with any drug it is best to do it in a familiar and safe place with people you trust, in a stress-free setting. If you're uncomfortable being high around your dad, your distress can be amplified and scare you away from doing weed again.  Best to wait until you've got experienced, trustworthy friends you can blaze/vape with, then once you have confidence in your ability to handle a buzz, you can then enjoy a good stoned conversation with your dad, should you choose to do so."

For the record...14 is just Too Damn Young IMHO. I started at 15, and I was too young myself. Even though I have an incredible amount of self-control now, I had none back then. And science knows a lot more about the effect on developing brains, and it's not a good idea, especially if you smoke more than a few times a month (I was doing it a few times a week).

Knowing as a kid that my dad was honest about the ""if you ever want to try drugs come to me and whatever it is we'll talk about it so i know your being safe"" was the best thing ever.

My parents don't know I smoke. I started once I moved out for college and now live on my own. They have no idea and would be really upset if they knew, but it could help them in so many ways.  My mom suffers from a lot of chronic pain. She's only 48 but has had a knee replacement and has some serious knock and back pain. And my dad has the hardest time sleeping and it's really fucking him up. Cannabis could help them in many many ways, but it's a dangerous drug in their eyes.  If you do this, I'd highly recommend having them watch the Union on Netflix and Dr. Sanjay Gupta's CNN specials (pretty sure they're called ""Weed"") Also, I think you should sit down with them, perhaps separately, and explain the benefits that you've recognized, then have them watch the documentaries, and then suggest that you'd like them to try it with you, in a safe setting, to check it out.   And if your parents have any sense of humor, show them these videos too. It's the icing on the cake, if you ask me. https://youtu.be/cHhOeoSHs-4 and https://youtu.be/Q2eXs4pCs3k Good luck m9  Edit: at a solid [7], so ""neck and back pain"" is correction number one and ""m8"" is the second."
saplings,3797gp,gameofthroffice,2,Mon May 25 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"I'm still toying with the idea myself. I was definitely gonna show them the documentaries first and let that sink in for a bit before offering. A big part of the problem is they don't understand what being high is like. They have only really witnessed the bad effects of weed where people use it while in a rut to add some happiness and start abusing it and never end up getting out of the rut. My thoughts on any substance including weed is that it shouldn't be used as your way to be happy when sad or in a tough spot but instead something to unwind after a hard days work much like a cold beer to most people. Sure the weed can help when sad, but if every time you are sad you have to smoke it then it might lead to a problem. I think i can convince my mom to watch the documentaries but if I try to get my dad to watch he will twist it as me needing to convince him to let me smoke which to him proves I'm addicted. I think my dad will simply never support me with it especially since he hates me for it and says its useless, yet hes all for legalization. I'm used to him never making much sense due to his ignorance, but this logic is especially confusing to me. Thanks for your advice on the matter and if you want I can pm you on how things go if I decide to offer them weed."

Also, if your mom is open to it and listens to you, talk to her about approaching your dad. If both his wife and his child are interested and believe it to be potentially beneficial, that's an odd thing to vehemently refuse.  Also, if he still says no, but is less harsh about it, consider that a win and start working towards it slowly.  Sense the tone."

If I can't convince him that not all pot smokers are like his brothers where they need it everyday and make it their priority through my personal experiences and documentaries than neither will my mom. If I tell her to talk to him about it he will come right around and bite me in the ass claiming I fed her false information and ruined her. Its happened in every other thing my mom agreed on with me that he denied and really don;t see this being different. The short of it is he's an asshole, even his friends have warned me of it."

saplings,37a99j,Lorenzo13335,7,Tue May 26 03:21:39 2015 UTC,I feel like you'd have to clean it after every use which would suck because bongs can get funky quick. I have three and they typically build up tar/burnt plant shit  quickly and that is what causes the smell and terribleness that is bong water . Check out a bubbler if you still want some water filtration with a smaller size and it's easier to hide in a smell proof container.
saplings,37a99j,SPLOOGESPLOSION,4,Tue May 26 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"Keeping your stuff clean is the #1 way to keep the smell down. Always use fresh water, and clean your bowl immediately after every sesh if possible. Also, be aware that bongs can naturally make more smoke than pipes/bubblers, so I'd suggest keeping it right next to a window as you're using it. And if it's too cold for that superglue a quarter to the bottom of your lighter to seal the top of the bowl between each hit and prevent excess smoke. Also a smoke buddy might be something to interest you. You blow into this magical tunnel, and a carbon filter absorbs all the smoke you can push into it. Good luck, man, and be careful using it often, accidentally ripping too hard can be a headache in that situation. Toke on, fellow ent!"

saplings,37a8y9,roryo,2,Tue May 26 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"I was like this when I first started smoking. Obviously one of the biggest downsides to smoking is paranoia, which everyone gets to varying degrees when they smoke, but with experience you deal with it better.  To give my own experiences, the first while I smoked in groups, people would be giggly or I'd be so fucking baked that I didn't understand the conversation and people would laugh and I would wonder if they were laughing at me. Or I would think I was way more stoned than everyone else and worry that I was being weird or people knew it or something.  Eventually, as I smoked with people more and more I just stopped giving a fuck, I basically just reminded myself ""dude, you're going to get paranoid as fuck, so if you freak out about something, remember it's just the weed fucking with you"" ... and I would get more and more comfortable when stoned and gradually started acting more and more like myself and less and less quiet and paranoid.  I think on the scale of how paranoid people get, I was pretty high (pardon the pun), like an 8 or a 9 out of 10 - you sound like you might be too - so my golden rule is to just remember that it's ok to be quiet if you're just stoned and chilling, and if you think weird shit like you're being weird or that people think you're being weird or too quiet or whatever, that's just the weed fucking with you - even if someone says it to you, that can put your paranoia into overdrive, but just chill man, everything is fine and you don't need to worry. Accept it for what it is and don't let your mind freak you out. The more and more you accept that it's ok and the less and less you allow yourself to worry, gradually it goes away and you don't even think about it and chat like you would normally if you feel like it.  I used to hang out with this awesome girl who got me really comfortable being stoned, we used to just sit and smoke and talk about random shit and I think the one on one smoking with someone you think is really cool and get along with really well helps a lot when you return to larger groups and are less self conscious.  TL;DR You're just being paranoid man. Keep reminding yourself that smoking makes you paranoid when you're baked and remember everything is fine and you're not weird. Over time it will pass."

saplings,378ah5,AceOfReQuiem,3,Tue May 26 02:25:08 2015 UTC,My sister was diagnosed with MS a few years ago and my parents kept pestering me to get a checkup. The pestering stopped when i told them I've been self medicating myself against it for the past several years.
saplings,378ah5,AceOfReQuiem,2,Mon May 25 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"Im kinda struggeling with the same. There is so much misinformation, prejudice, ignorance and sheer stupidity concerning cannabis I sometimes feel its better to just leave it. My housemates (who are good friends) know I smoke and are fine with it and occasionally light one up with me. Id like to tell my parents but  dont really wanna start a hassle if it turns sideways. Then again, knowing my parents they would probably be sorta fine with it.   Ill probably tell my lil' sis first and see from there as we are close.  I kinda keep in mind that if it helps me as much as it does and im being straight to myself and people are really digging into you they can shove off with their opinions :/ [7]"
saplings,378ah5,Buddyforealdo,2,Mon May 25 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. That and I grew up with a lot of people who let it take over their lives, similar to alcoholism. I don't blame the plant anymore. I think it takes a special kind of person to let it get like that.  Idk.  I get scared that it'll take over me one day. I mean, I don't even drink anymore. I've replaced my 5-6 girly drinks with my vaporizer and I couldn't be happier.  I sleep so much better.  I've avoided doing it before or during work. I want to keep that much going. But idk. It's just so nice to do it after a long, hard day at work.  I can see how people would think it's addictive. It's just so nice to be able to let go. Much like having a drink.

Hint...if you think the person is square and will react negatively then don't tell them.  And don't give so much of a shit what people think of you with stereotypes and shit.....but will they turn you in.
saplings,378ah5,vznlogic,2,Tue May 26 00:23:20 2015 UTC,"As for siblings, if you trust them you can just talk about it next time you're alone with them for a decent length of time. It might be awkward to discuss, but giving them some insight could do them some good. You can also frame the conversation as including your opinion on the subject but without admitting you smoke, or admitting it's a regular thing, because like it or not, younger siblings could take that as you being permissive of them picking it up, and you'd really be opening Pandora's Box with that one.  If there's family you trust aside from your parents, like an aunt/uncle or cousin, you could be open about it with them.   However, I get the impression you're either a minor or still living at home, so telling your parents/authority figures can probably wait until you're either of age or living on your own. I smoke, but if my kids began smoking while they were still minors there would be at least a little self-reflection after finding that out, whereas later in life they'll probably be able to laugh about it more when they know you've turned out alright.  If you smoke responsibly and aren't coming home blitzed all the time, and it doesn't negatively impact any aspect of your life, anyway, there really is no reason for them to have to know now."
saplings,378ah5,boganisu,3,Tue May 26 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"Haha, nope. I could see why you would think I was though. I'm 22 and I've been on my own for a lonnng time now. It's mostly just opening the discussion with my siblings that I'm concerned about. Both parents have done it in the past, but they both kinda block it out as if it was a really bad time in their life or something. My family has really bad communication issues.  As far as the Pandora's box issue, I totally agree. My two younger brothers are still kinda young, 17 and 15, so I don't really want to make them feel pressured or anything. I just want to try and set a better example than my sister did, since they both are outright terrified of any drugs and alcohol.  I guess I really just want to give them better information than I had growing up. All I knew came from Dare and my parents when things were really rough at home. I always resented them for doing it and pretty much ignoring us. My sister was the same way. It always felt like I was watching my family just melt away into nothing. Like it was all they could do anymore.  It sucked and I lost a lot of friends just because they started smoking in highschool and I still very much despised everything to do with it.  I just don't want them to go through all that. Otherwise, I'd keep all this to myself because who cares."

saplings,379gn2,Varalaz,2,Tue May 26 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"Waterfall bong will hit you nicely (if you get high your first time). Take it slow. Fill your lungs with the smoke, exhale slowly. After that just do whatever you would normally do. Watch some TV, go for a walk, grab some of your favorite food, or listen to some music. Just relax and don't think about being high or if you are high. Get as comfortable as you can be and enjoy.   There are different kinds of attainable highs depending on your body, strain of weed (Sativa/Indica), and method of inhalation (Bong/Vaporizer). Whatever you feel, just know that it is temporary and you should try and enjoy it as much as possible.   Tips?  -Drink LOTS of water  -Light and inhale slowly to avoid coughing   -Have some sort of throat lozenge nearby in case you scorch your throat  -Try looking at vibrant and colorful things. Nature is nice."

Perhaps your country has similar smoke shops?  As far as finding a dealer, when I first moved there and had no hookups, I just brought Pink Floyd up to coworkers. if they said they loved Floyd too, I'd say ""Funny, you don't strike me as being a stoner."" Conversation progressed, and bam, hookup. Remember to make it worth their trouble.  If you are in someplace like Indonesia, ignore all this because don't they hang you for weed there? Weed's not that good.

saplings,37ah6r,spoetnick,1 point,Tue May 26 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"First - Weed isn't a go-to solution for everyone with stress. Smoking a lot of sativa can cause stress and anxiety for some people.  Second - You can buy whatever you want from Amazone. The item isn't illegal. If you want to smoke tobacco or whatever out of a bong, you are free to do so. I've never heard of a country or area where a bong, pipe, vape, smoking papers, or whatever is illegal. This goes extra for vapes because some people actually use them or vaping stuff besides MJ.  How to find your dealer is a pretty cultural thing. Over here I can spot the stoner in an instant. Not all of them of course, but some people make it very obvious. Maybe there is a sub-culture around your area which are know for their intake of weed (and maybe other drugs).  If it's illegal you probably have a high chance of success in finding someone who sells in the downtown, depending on how bad your downtown is, this might or might not be a viable option.  You can always grow yourself, but that might not be worth the risk."

I'd say your best bet would be to learn to roll a joint or go on youtube and look at the many ways you can smoke without any bought equipment, eg an apple pipe.   As for acquiring weed, ask around and see who smokes weed in your school. Approach the people and ask them if they sell and if not ask them if they can connect you with their dealer. I've never experienced a stoner who wasn't friendly to other stoners/aspiring stoners.  Remember, a lot more people smoke weed than you think... even in a conservative town."

The high lasts around 5-6 hours maybe less, depending on how much. But at the last couple hours it wont be noticeable. Also Visine works perfect especially for red eyes. You can have the reddest eyes ever, and as soon as Visine hits your eyes, you're good :) I don't think your parents will catch you especially since you have 4 hours.

Do you have some kind of a park nearby where you'd feel comfortable? That would be ideal.  It would in fact be a bad idea if you don't know the area at all and your way home takes too long. In that case, maybe take a risk and try to smoke out if a window or something like that. Will your parents be at home?"

There are very little studies done on long term use and, as far as I know, the majority have dealt with lung health.   That said, we have a pretty good idea that we will all be okay. Marijuana isn't anything new and has been used without long term harm thus far. I personally think we should be worried about our lungs more than anything because, let's be honest, taking huge bong rips of thick smoke is horrible for them. It has tar and carcinogens just like cigarettes and people seem to ignore that. I'm not saying people shouldn't smoke their weed (I smoke cigarettes), I'm saying that people should be well aware that it is harmful to your health and know of alternatives.   I think weed can suppress our emotions to an extent. I know a few adults that can't face reality or their emotions and I think a piece of that puzzle could certainly be using pot irresponsibly. Pot can certainly amplify our emotions, but we can also easily shut them out if they're overwhelming. So, if you're doing this, when you sober up you're going to feel all those emotions you shoved deep down. You see this in alcoholics a lot and I think it can be attributed to any substance abuse issue.   Weed is probably pretty harmless for responsible long term use, but we need to acknowledge the negatives so we can avoid/work on them and not trick ourselves into a marijuana fantasy."

saplings,3741dx,Phil_Laysheo,2,Tue Jun 2 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I avoid tobacco as much as possible. Since most of my friends are smoking spliffs, and I don't want to smoke alone/be the only one that rolls joints for everyone, I have to smoke it every now and then. In which case, I try to make sure it's additive free. It's also not uncommon that all I can get is hash, and it doesn't always burn well on it's own, so it's good to have some tobacco on hand.   Apart from that, the only time I'll smoke tobacco is when I'm drunk, because alcohol gives me crazy cravings for cigarettes. But I don't drink often either, being high is much more enjoyable imo."

It gives users the impression that changing the way they feel can be easily achieved with a plant or a powder or a crystal or a pill or a liquid or a vapour. Took a dab about 1 hour ago and another dab 5 minutes ago and I like the feeling.

It shouldn't surprise anyone that people who like altering their consciousness with one substance would be interested in trying it with other substances. But with the gateway drug hypothesis, what happens is that eventually the cannabis high isn't enough, so you search out something stronger, and then something stronger than that, and then something stronger than that, and so on until you die of an overdose, and that simply is not what happens."

saplings,374z0r,silverpanther17,2,Mon May 25 00:49:56 2015 UTC,"First time I ever experienced marijuana was when my friend's brother brought him some 'special' chocolate from Colorado.  We each had a piece and played some CaH.  An hour later, he was visibly out of it and I was feeling stone cold sober.  I tell him, he gives me the, ""it takes a while for some people,"" spiel, and I wait another 30 minutes.  Now I'm a big guy, so I figure I just have a higher tolerance than him, so I take a 2nd piece and we put some music on.  Another 30 minutes, I still feel nothing and I'm getting kind of pissed off, so I sneak a 3rd piece thinking, ""what's the worst that could happen?""  Later that night, and I should say it's New Years and it's cold as balls outside, that night we're outside on his porch and another friend pulls out his piece and we pack a bowl.  I'm freezing my ass off, and I've never taken a hit before, but I think I get the gist of it.  The guy to my right hands me his piece and a lighter, I take a tiny-ass, inexperienced hit, and suddenly, I'm not cold anymore.  I remember staring off into the distance and saying out loud, ""Oh Fuck.""  It hit me like a brick wall.  After a while we go into this room, it's around 11:30 and the ball's about to drop in New York, and I have no idea what the fuck is going on.  Shit's spinning, I can't keep track of anything, and to top it off, everyone around me is trying to fuck with me.  I don't hold it against them, I'd do the same to them probably.  I distinctly remember my vision going red for some reason, and I could no longer control my voice.  I'd later find out that my friends had purchased and blown up a bag of red balloons, filled the room with them, and started playing 99 Red Balloons on the nearby speaker.  I was making velociraptor noises in the corner.  In short, I was fucked up.  I pass out at around 12:30 after we go through another bowl and 2 glasses of champagne each.  At around 10:00, I wake up and realize that I'm still at what must be a [5], assuming the night before I was around a [9] if not a [10].  Again, it was my first time, so I didn't know if it was possible to go higher than that, but I can confirm I've never been that faded since, and I don't plan on it anytime soon.  We chill until around 5:00 that evening and I'm still hovering around a [3].  I had to head home, but I still knew that I wasn't 100% there, so I did what I still consider to be the stupidest decision of my life: I drove home.  To crowbar a moral into my story, never drive under the influence of cannabis.  Mind you, I was fine, but I was panicking out of my mind the entire way there.  By the time I get home (it was a 2 hour drive), I'm finally sober and it's around 8:00.  tl;dr: 22 hours."

Before I had a high tolerance I would always have some huge smoke sessions with me and my buddies. We saved kief for like a month and it was at least 3 grams of kief between both of us and from a kief shaker. We smoked all of my pipes at the time and around a q of bud. We smoked every bowl with an insane amount of kief on each bowl. Just saying we got high was an understatement. I was completely visually tripping and I couldn't stand. I was passing out for like 3 hours at a time randomly that entire day and it was ridiculous how high I was. It was a little bit too much honestly. Now, to decide how high we are we compare it to ""kief day"" as we have now deemed it. I was high for around a week.

saplings,3762g0,neggie,2,Mon May 25 04:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're better off taking smaller hits. Pull on the bong until you fill your longs half way then pull the bowl and clear it. The goal isn't to burn through the entire bowl or to milk the entire piece up. The reason for the piece length, until you start hitting ""novelty"" sizes, is to increase cooling of the smoke.  I think you'll find using a small oil rig to be quite harsh and a waste of money if you only plan to smoke flower; the air path is shorter and more constricted, it's primarily designed to keep vapor hot. A bubbler would be comparable and much cheaper if you're only smoking."

You aren't a regular smoker so you probably suffered from a little afterglow (weed hangover) and the anxiety of waking up still a little funny. Secondly, it's normal to have a bit of a dopamine drop after a social event, and cannabis can influence that, consider it as serious as being bummed after coming home from a nice vacation. Third, it's common to feel a little depressed if you have low blood sugar... sleeping for a solid 10 hours it sounds like won't help that.  In other words, you're fine. It's normal to feel a little down after a party and you may simply be overstating how you feel because of the anxiety of still learning how cannabis affects you.  Next time you smoke, try doing it in a situation that's less stimulating. Sit down and listen to a record or something."

saplings,3746nf,Phil_Laysheo,-3,Sun May 24 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"Well you smoked marijuana which is a stimulant, in simple terms: THC works by hijacking the receptors in your brain, and firing most pleasure, rising your heartbeat a bit, your blood starts flowing. When you're off of THC all of the sudden, your body expects the THC to add its effects in excess so it no longer has to produce all of those feelings when you are high naturally. The same thing can happen if you are just starting."

I guess the weed makes the feeling of accomplishment that much better. If I smoke and had things to do I feel bad about not doing them. I guess use weed as a reward instead of using it to help procrastinate and be lazy is your best option.

saplings,374l2u,mrw0rldw1de,2,Sun May 24 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"I smoke out of my bowl, or roll a blunt if I'm hanging with more than one person. Since I got my MFLB, I vape exclusively whenever I'm alone.  The weed mixed with tobacco is, at least in my area, called a spliff. They're very uncommon, I have never met a person in the south who mixes tobacco and weed. I know in other parts of the world this is common practice,  but not in the states. Pure marihuana in my joints/blunts."
saplings,374l2u,gameofthroffice,2,Sun May 24 21:44:38 2015 UTC,In CO and other legalized places dabs and concentrates are becoming increasingly popular.
saplings,374l2u,TwinPeakMayor,2,Sun May 24 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"Rolling weed is probably the most common way to use it, in terms of the whole world, with regular bowls being the second most common.  It's common to roll weed with tobacco (spliffs) in countries where access to weed is more restricted and tobacco use is more accepted.  In the US, people tend to roll weed pure, but I have a few friends who like spliffs, or roll them to help be discreet.  I smoke my bubbler with and without water, and I'm happy with that.  It provides the types of highs I'm looking for, and that's good enough for me."
saplings,374l2u,Hybyscus,1 point,Sun May 24 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"I mostly use a bowl, and will be getting a hand vape soon. I have never mixed weed and tobacco, neither have most other people I know, but some people do definitely no where near the majority."
saplings,374l2u,SeriouslyShirley,1 point,Sun May 24 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say the most common way would be rolling it up in paper. Depending on the quality of your weed and personal preference you can use some sort of filler, such as tobacco.   Here in the Netherlands it's quite uncommon not to mix it up. Gives you a nice nicotine high and general stonedness. Rolling a pure one is for special occasions or people with a way high tolerance. Mixing it up is only viable if the weed is potent enough. A mate if currently doing his internship near Congo and all he can find there is brick weed. Smoking that stuff pure doesn't even get him high, so mixing that up seems ridiculous.  Rolling joints is easy, it's tasty, it's fast, you can role it to your own taste. The only downside to smoking is the unhealthiness.  Besides rolling them up, a lot of people use items such as bongs, and pipes. Most 'stoners' I know have a few of these around.  The next big thing that hitting the smoker/stoner world would be the vaporizers. Anything from a e-cig to the famous Volcano fall into this category. You get all the tastiness and pleasant effects without the downside of actual combustion. Is it way more healthy? Time will tell. Does it get you freakishly high? Oh yeah!"
saplings,374l2u,spoetnick,1 point,Sun May 24 21:50:58 2015 UTC,Dabbing is quite common in Colorado because it's easy clean and mostly smell free.
saplings,374l2u,M1RR0R,1 point,Mon May 25 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"All these answers saying rolling it in a joint is most popular makes me laugh.  Joints tend to consume a lot of weed, and most new ents aren't buying a ton to begin with.  The most common way that I see is either a bong, or a pipe.  There's obviously dabs, which require wax rigs and a blow torch, and it's fun and all, but I wouldn't say that's the most common.  It's definitely blown up since I started smoking, some 13 years ago."

Maybe it's just the groups I smoke with but we usually roll joints and blunts, or else we'll do three or four bowls in a bong, but we all buy and smoke together almost every night so we just roll multiple and bring the ones we don't smoke to the next sess. It's always cool to hear what the ""culture"" is like in other places."

saplings,372pxg,WINBLADE,13,Sun May 24 08:42:41 2015 UTC,"Why it feels different is that some of the chemicals only get released when they are raised to a certain temperature. When vaping, the bud is raised to a temperature thats below combustion temp. The chemicals that add to give that combustion high you're talking about don't get released without being exposed to temperatures that burning the herb allows for."
saplings,372pxg,tRedditAccount,4,Sun May 24 09:47:48 2015 UTC,I guess that's why you can still make edibles out of AVB?
saplings,372pxg,tRedditAccount,4,Sun May 24 09:59:08 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. The reason why AVB works is because when heated up to a certain temperature, THC turns to THC-A. Basically it turns into a type of THC that when digested, can enter our blood streams. So the less that you vape the bud (breathe in THC), the more active it will be as an edible as more THC will be left in the bud, but you need to vape it (idk how many times) for the THC to turn to THCA. As for those other chemicals, I'm not entirely sure if we just shit them out or they go into our blood streams, google can help if you are interested."
saplings,372pxg,BangYourHead,8,Sun May 24 10:07:37 2015 UTC,I thought it started as THC-A and turned into THC when it reached that tempurature and not the other way around

saplings,372pxg,jlm25150,7,Sun May 24 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"When you vape (at the right temperature), you are mostly vaporizing THC and other cannabinoids with cerebral effects. When you smoke, you are also inhaling CBD and other cannabinoids responsible for a more ""body high"" as well as all the byproducts from the plant matter. Therefore, vaping usually gives a rather clean and energetic high as opposed to a sluggish, relaxing high from smoking."
saplings,372pxg,pantsoff,1 point,Sun May 24 09:49:51 2015 UTC,How would edibles or tea compare?
saplings,372pxg,kissmyrobot,2,Sun May 24 13:06:26 2015 UTC,"Different even still. THC is metabolized in the liver into 11-hydroxy THC which is more potent and lasts longer in your system. The bioavailability of other cannabinoids and terpenes also changes, although I've found very little research about their metabolism when ingested."
saplings,372pxg,pantsoff,1 point,Sun May 24 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thank you."
saplings,372pxg,jlm25150,2,Mon May 25 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Edibles have a much longer onset time. Sometimes as little as an hour, but can sometimes take up to like 3-4. The high will last a long time, but you will have the effects of both THC and CBD cannabinoids. I unfortunately do not have any experience with teas or tinctures."
saplings,372pxg,pantsoff,1 point,Sun May 24 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My guess is that from a medicinal point of view edibles, oils (skin application) and teas are best for uptake by the body."
saplings,372pxg,nidal33,1 point,Sun May 24 23:18:35 2015 UTC,Any more info on vaping? I really want to get a vape within my next couple paychecks. thanks in advance bro
saplings,372pxg,jlm25150,1 point,Sun May 24 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Is there anything you want to know specifically? I only have experience with an MFLB, and I really like it! I've had it for almost two years and it's hard going back to smoking after using it because the high is pretty different.  With an MFLB you can also use a lot less bud than smoking. A little trench can hold like .1-.2 grams and after you feel it's done you can save it. There are many ways you can use bud that has already been vaped and that includes edibles, tinctures, smoking it, or even vaping it again if you mix it with some kief. This stretches out your stash for way longer!  What sucks about the MFLB is that you use batteries, but if you buy like 4 of Magic Flight's own Glyph batteries you can use one for two trenches and keep rotating the batteries in a charger and always have fresh ones. They also have a wall/car adapter that is way better if you don't mind being next to a plug. Also, an MFLB is more personal so it's kinda awkward using it with more than two people.  And don't forget about their lifetime warranty! The price of an MFLB is pretty steep, but their warranty is amazing! If you break it in any way accidentally, Magic Flight will replace it right away! I've only broken it twice (from falls), and they let you keep it until they send a new one. Then you disassemble it and send photos to keep your warranty. So as long as you don't lose it, you will have it for life!  That's all I can think of at the moment, but let me know if you have any other questions!"

saplings,372pxg,ForeverBronze1,1 point,Sun May 24 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was because with burning the herb, you are inhaling all of the carcinogens that come along with the full combustion and those have an added effect to the high as opposed to vaping being primarily THC you are inhaling."

I mean, if my level of dealing was to where I could only afford to buy and sell an ounce, I wouldn't want to like, buy an ounce and sell it right back to someone else cuz I am likely not getting a kickass price on said ounce.  Now, if I am buying a pound at a time, or even a QP...selling an ounce all at once is a lot less of a deal.  I'd rather flip an o and make a quick 50, rather than wait to sell a bunch of different people quads and make a slow and potentially painful 100.  That being said, bagging custom orders is just part of the job.  Provide good customer service, get repeat customers, ?????, profit."

saplings,3728rp,PaperCupsAhoy,3,Sun May 24 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"There are a few things that might have gone wrong here, but I will try to help you out as much as I can.    From experience I have only ever had edibles take somewhere around 0.5-1.5 hours to kick in. There is a chance, a very small one, but a chance none-the-less that your butter just hasn't kicked in yet.  How much kief did you use? Most recipes use a 2-1 ratio where you would use say 1 ounce of hash (or kief) and 2 pounds of butter. There is a chance that you just did not use enough product and used too much butter so that even in a large amount there is not much THC. I have never heard a recipe that calls for water to be added along with the butter, and since you waited for the water to evaporate there is a chance (I am no chemistry major so I have no idea if this is even possible) that the water took the THC along with it, or because it was at a temperature that caused it to evaporate that the THC was simply burned in the pan. Something might have gone wrong with you cooling it down too fast by putting it right into the fridge, maybe leave it out to cool to room temperature first and then put it in the fridge. For reference and a recipe that will work the next time, check out this link.   Sorry that it didn't work, man! Kief savings wasted can feel bad, so to be safe I would just roll that shit or pack a bowl with it. But if you enjoy the edible side refer to that recipe and hopefully it goes better next time. Also I didn't mean to sound ignorant or know-it-all, I am just trying to help you figure out what went wrong. Good luck with this batch and the next one. Don't quit because it went wrong once!"
saplings,3728rp,PaperCupsAhoy,1 point,Sun May 24 05:26:20 2015 UTC,"Well as far as I understand the compounds that give the effects aren't soluble in water, the water is just there to keep the butter from burning.

The only thing that removes the smell of burning or fresh ganja is either completely removing the smelly air by blowing it outside, or time, by just letting it go away on its own.  If neither of those are viable options, you may want to try eliminating the smell altogether by making yourself a good sploof.  The link is to a comment I made recently about using activated-carbon for a sploof.

All of the people who work at the shops speak english, and fully expect to sell to foreigners. You do have to be 18 to even enter a coffeeshop, and they card pretty consistently. I used my drivers license as id and they were fine with that.  In general people don't smoke much in public outside of the coffeeshops. I did see a few tourists walking down the street sharing a joint but it was not very common. If he wants to smoke outside he should find a park or somewhere where he can get some space.   You can read about the policy of tolerance [here].(http://www.holland.com/us/tourism/article/dutch-drug-policy.htm)  Of course, he could still get in trouble back in Australia if he fails a drug test or something.

saplings,3721sg,Sad_Yoshi,2,Sun May 24 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"Smoke slowly and smoke small amounts at a time.   Just take a small hit and wait until you feel something. If 10 - 15 minutes later you don't feel anything then take another small hit, gradually work your way up into a place that you're comfortable with. You have no tolerance so you don't need much at all. I remember when I first started I could take 1 or 2 hits off a joint filled with average weed and be high for hours.    Also when you smoke try and make sure you're in a calm state. If you smoke when you're all worked up and paranoid you're not going to have a good time. Just settle down and relax before you smoke.   Finally seeing as you're in a legal state, which is a blessing, go to a dispensary and talk to one of the people there. They should be able to recommend you a strain that is low THC and even give you some good advice. I'd avoid sativa if I was you, ask for a calming indica dominant strain."

This will train your brain back towards not being so scared. Respect the brain in this - your reaction of fear to something you've had two bad experiences now is reasonable - and it is also reasonable to lose that fear again when you have newer better experiences that demonstrate your growing maturity with the product that you know can produce some of the sweetest feelings you've ever had.   Got that? So, you want to set yourself up a calm safe space with the single dedicated plan to have your self a good high session - and knowing that if this don't quite work out, that's no problem, you'll just try again another day.   I tend to think it is better for that to not be a game session - but you know yourself better than me, so go with what you think will be the most pleasant low-threat environment. Don't take multiple hits too quick in a row. Relax.   Good luck bro. Give us an update on it sometime. [6]"

You can tell this by smelling it, if it doesn't smell normal there is a chance it is moldy. Mold has a distinct smell so hopefully you will know. If it is wet, obviously wait for it to dry out and see what it smells like from there. If you don't want to take a chance, then don't. Otherwise best of luck and hopefully it is still good stuff!"

Lemonade doesn't actually counteract any THC (I'm more than fairly certain that no food or drink does that), but re-hydrating yourself with so many electrolytes and natural sugars would be a great way to ""sober up"", as it were, at least a bit.  Also, ingesting small amounts of acid is actually very good for you overall, which is why it is recommended to drink small amounts of vinegar occasionally."
saplings,36y158,ThePurpleHayes,2,Sat May 23 03:53:58 2015 UTC,"No, that wouldn't sober you up. Time is that only thing that can actually sober someone up.  A diuretic could help increase sobriety if you had edibles or alcohol, anything else would be a placebo effect or in the case of coffee simply removing the feeling of sluggishness by increasing blood pressure. Most cannabis related tips have very little foundation in science but the placebo effect is very real.   If I tell my brother the weed is higher quality, even though its the exact same thing he smoked the night before he will claim to be way higher."
saplings,36y158,dudewiththebling,1 point,Sat May 23 08:24:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, your friend is wrong and stupid. Lemonade has nothing that inter or counteracts with marijuana, mango juice and other closely related juices have the same myrcene but other than that you should research before belief."

Shit I smoke everyday and I definitely notice it, I wouldn't recommend smoking a lot at this time. If you smoke once in a while (I'd recommend biweekly just to be safe for the brain fog) you'll be fine. I highly doubt after smoking you're gonna want to write your paper but you could try haha. If anything, it'll motivate you to do it later.  EDIT: Also, any impairment affects should be gone by the 2nd day after smoking, 4 days after at MOST.

My answer to that question, is sort of. I feel like since I've started smoking my motivation has gone slightly down due to the fact that weed is another priority of mine, it's low on the priority list, but it's there. Also, I feel not as intelligent as I use to be. It seems like I'm not as ""on top of things"" and what not, not as quick to notice things. Lastly, after I smoke, the next few days it almost feels like there's this lingering high over me, where I still feel slightly high and that does impair my cognitive function. Ill stare at things as if I was high sometimes and lose my focus easier.   Again, I have done no scientific research on the effects THC actually has on you, what I experienced could have been from outside effects or just placebo."

saplings,36y11m,jack-dawed,1 point,Sat May 23 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Regular marijuana use does impair cognitive abilities, mostly in the short-term, but also sometimes in the long-term. I'm seriously tired of people acting as if marijuana is a miracle cure-all that has no adverse side-effects whatsoever, because, frankly, it isn't true. Marijuana's risks and downfalls are substantially less harmful and likely than other substances, but that doesn't at all mean that they aren't harmful and impossible. And although every individual is different, meaning that no 2 people will have exactly the same experiences with marijuana, there are observable trends and occurrences that tend to happen to regular users.  Okay, rant aside, yes, regular marijuana use can impair your mental abilities. Once I started smoking once per week about 6 months ago, I've noticed that my mental processes have become ever-so-slightly sluggish, I have a little trouble remembering things at a timely pace, and I sometimes fail to use the most accurate words in a sentence. I'm also finding it easier to zone out nowadays, which isn't necessarily abnormal for me, since I've had a habit of zoning out for my whole life, but it just happens a lot easier now, and sometimes without really me knowing. All in all, I'm the same person, and I haven't noticed my drive or determination go down at all, it's just that my brain is kind of walking through mud.  Regular marijuana use during the early- to mid-teenage years has the large potentiality of causing permanent impairment on the brain's development, specifically the frontal lobe, which controls many emotions, manners, memory, problem solving skills, voluntary thought processes, etc. In an ideal world, since the brain completely finishes developing at the age of 24, no one would smoke or drink until that age.   Right now I'm drawing a blank on something I was just thinking of, lol. I'm confident that my weekly smoke-day has something to do with it.  Anywho, one of my friends gets high every single day. He is pretty scatterbrained, he'll forget to grab something out of his apartment that we just discussed, and he is usually at a ""loss for words"" in that he can't find the right way to say something, but is, otherwise, pretty intelligent, and works full-time and is very active socially; I wouldn't consider him a ""deadbeat"" or anything. My other friend, however, also gets high every day (sometimes multiple times per day), and he's useless now. He has no drive or aspirations in life, he's an unbearable free-loader, and he doesn't think for himself at all, he simply regurgitates whatever he's seen on Tumblr. Those are only 2 instances, but they accurately encapsulate the potential risks of regular marijuana use.  If I were you, I wouldn't worry about your vocabulary too much. I'm not sure if it was purposeful or not, but, just judging from your opening spiel, you seem to be rather ""linguistically diverse"" as it is. Even if you started smoking marijuana so often that you started to become ""sluggish"" in the head, the brain is plastic, meaning that it can adapt and strengthen itself over time; just keep reading that dictionary and you shouldn't have any problems.  In the short-term, the tell-tale ""fogginess"" the day after smoking pot will go away. After my smoke-day, I'll usually be foggy all day afterwards, but then completely normal the day after that.  TL;DR: Regular marijuana use can definitely affect your long-term mental abilities. Short-term effects go away in a few days at the most. The brain can adjust, so if you feel yourself slipping, just study new vocabulary some more.  P.S.: I've been thoroughly researching marijuana since I was in middle school, so I promise I am not talking out of my ass, lol"

saplings,36wp6x,KJHazed420,10,Sat May 30 23:09:09 2015 UTC,"You can make a sploof that is significantly more efficient by using activated-carbon instead of dryer sheets. Dryer sheets do a somewhat acceptable job of masking the scent, but activated-carbon actually absorbs the scent. Activated-carbon is incredibly porous and absorbs even some of the tiniest scent molecules. In fact, activated-carbon is what is used inside gas-mask filters. Plus, it's really easy to get; you can easily get a container of activated-carbon at any pet store for less than 10 clams. I've still got an assload of it in my closet.   Get a pile of activated-carbon and run it under water to get rid of all the dust, and then wrap up the pile of carbon in a paper towel or two.  Stuff the whole thing into a toilet paper tube, and cover one end of it with a dryer sheet and a rubber-band. If it were up to me, I would duct-tape the dryer sheet on for maximum hold. Leave the other end open. After taking a hit, slowly exhale it through the open end of the sploof, and continue blowing through until there is no more smoke. There, easy sleazy.   The efficiency of the sploof does not really matter whether you let it dry out or not, but I would let it dry anyway simply to prevent yourself from blowing moisture everywhere.  I pulled this idea off of the top of my head. There are some methods online that involve putting the same process into an old prescription bottle, but those involve heating elements and more complicated procedures, which provides a sleeker looking sploof, but no better results."
saplings,36wp6x,Afrew,3,Fri May 22 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, activated carbon is really effective!  Since it's so cheap, you can go whole honcho with it. I like taking a plastic soda bottle and filling it with carbon/dryer sheet ""baggies"". Drill some holes in the bottom (or punch them with a hot nail if you don't have a drill). It's a little more involved, but it will absorb all the ""weed"" part of the smoke, with a just a bit of dryer-sheet smelling smoke left over."

PS. I guess you could just use regular tissue instead of dryer sheets but it won't work as well to cover smell"

It should easily separate along the moist fold. It still won't be as binding as gummed paper, but the ragged cellulose will stick better than the factory cut and it should help them hold together well enough to enjoy your smoke. ☮"

Omg what a difference I'm so sorry I ever wasted my wax trying to smoke it or let it float away while I tried to burn myself and ruin a kitchen knife.

So you just figure out, what size is your downstem. Say it's 14 mm, you then order the 14 mm nail and dome. You put the nail onto the downstem just like if it's your bowl. Then you heat the top of the nail with a butane torch. When the top is red hot you slide the dome over the nail, the dome is like a guide so the vapor doesn't escape before you suck it down into the bong. Then you get a metal dab stick, I use a real nail , put wax on the end and just touch it to the nail. Vapor smoke will start coming and you hit that bong! Yeah! There is no combustion taking place, just vaporization . I learned all this by watching YouTube videos and I would recommend watching a few, because then you can get a good idea how to do all the steps safely."

saplings,36vqgw,FriedShrekels,1 point,Sun May 24 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"Vaping is incredibly efficient, plus you can save the vaped bud.   I have an MFLB. .1-.3 grams is plenty to get pretty baked. I would highly recommend it, you can buy them for $80-$120, depending on the type of wood/accessories. There is a bit of a learning curve, but when you figure it out you'll never go back.  It's a different high than smoking. A little more heady, less groggy/heavy feeling. But the smell is way less and it doesn't smell nearly as bad, which helps out tremendously with stealth use. Even the vapor clouds dissipate fairly quickly and the smell doesn't linger hardly as long.  If you smoke more than 3 times a week, a vaporizer is a great investment."
saplings,36vqgw,gameofthroffice,1 point,Fri May 22 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Vaping is a great way to toke, but you have to be aware that it's not the same as smoking.  The high sort of creeps up on you, and it's more cerebral and less stony.  You should definitely try vaping to make sure you're ok with the high before you drop money on your own vaporizer.  Vaping has a lot of advantages over smoking.  It's a lot cleaner, and your lungs and throat will be much happier.  After vaping for a few years, I can't stand smoking from a pipe anymore because they taste so nasty and ashy.  Vapes tend to be more efficient in terms of how high you can get per unit of weed.  Also, you can save the revape and smoke it or use it to make edibles.  Vapes are also more stealthy in terms of smell if that's important to you.  I've owned a MFLB in the past, but I found the hits to be kind of weak.  With the power adapter, it's a pretty passable vape, but portability is important to me, so it sucked being tethered to a wall outlet to use the power adapter.  I've owned two Pax's.  They're really great vapes if portability and stealth are important to you and you're not that sensitive to price (they are pretty expensive).  The Pax hits great, looks slick, and is easy to use.  It does require regular cleaning to keep it functioning properly, and I've had malfunctions with my unit, but their customer support is awesome.  The other option if you're in a legal state or have access to extracts is to dissolve it into a PG/VG solution to make a THC-infused juice that you can use in e-cigs.  This is incredibly stealthy and efficient, but it only works if you have access to extracts like wax or shatter."

Bongs hit and taste significantly better than a pipe or a joint. If you go to a head shop near you, you can find a smaller bong to get you started. I've got one that's the size of a coffee mug."
saplings,36ulws,magicman0293,1 point,Fri May 22 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"A cheap glass pipe would run you like $5.  You say you ""only"" have 3.5g left, that's a significant amount unless it's poor quality, which will generally have a poor taste whichever way you smoke it.  I'd give a bowl a try, it'd save on weed too compared to joints."
saplings,36ulws,snowfalltranquility,1 point,Fri May 22 23:20:45 2015 UTC,It's possibs you have developed allergic to the smoke. I'm allergic all 3 and have the same problems. p.s. i would invest in a cheap used vaporizer off ebay and see if it helps
saplings,36ukk6,FriedShrekels,4,Fri May 22 06:27:25 2015 UTC,"Vaporizers deliver more cannabinoids than smoking; about 40-50% of the cannabinoids are destroyed during combustion.  That being said, the smoke itself causes a sort of dopiness that some people enjoy (I like it every now and then), and associate with how high they are.  Generally I find vaporizing gives me more stimulating highs, whereas smoking tends to be sort of crazier and intense in large quantities. I like vapes for chilling alone, and smoking for parties."

saplings,36ukk6,tak18,2,Sun May 24 01:54:10 2015 UTC,You do know it's not necessary to cook you avb? All you'd have to do is make sure it's a fine enough grind (I usually just run it through my fingers). And a nice food product with plenty of fats so the THC can bond.
saplings,36svsh,randomacc435,36,Thu May 21 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Not even a single gram. I've been smoking no more than once per week for over a year, and I get pretty stoned from less than 6 hits. I can't imagine smoking an entire gram or more by myself in a single session.  Realistically, you'll take about 2 hits, and then call it quits. I don't see any first-timer going hit-for-hit with an experienced friend and still having an enjoyable time."

saplings,36svsh,josephkony69,5,Fri May 22 06:08:55 2015 UTC,A fraction of a gram.  But it also depends on potency and method of smoking.

saplings,36svsh,Soluz,2,Thu May 21 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"0.1g-0.2g will probably give you some to moderate effects. 0.2g-0.4g will probably give you a moderate to strong experience. 0.6g-0.8g will be quite strong, maybe too much. 0.8g-1g will be very strong almost definitely too much if you don't smoke often.  This isn't gospel it depends on your tolerance, the potency of your weed, your method of consumption etc but thats a general guide for a beginner.  Hope this helps, enjoy!"
saplings,36svsh,Elljot,3,Fri May 22 03:23:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I'm not planning on smoking anything anytime soon as I live with my mom and I'll probably order from the deep web if/when I do. Man I thought weed was this super expensive you-better-start-saving-up-at-least-a-week-before kind of deal. The first link I checked on the deep web sold 3,5 grams of organic chronic (whatever that means) for 40 euros with delivery. Since I've got nothing to compare it to is this cheap, normal or expensive? Wtf in Norway it's 30$ for a half a litre of vodka, and its only like 4 euros to get high?"
saplings,36svsh,Elljot,2,Fri May 22 06:07:44 2015 UTC,"Cool, stay safe when you're ordering off the deepweb. Make sure to research your vendors and make sure they use adaquete stealth measures. Also you might want to favour domestic dealers over international because there's less chance of it being intercepted.   3.5g for 40 sounds good to me, but different places cost more and less. Norway is meant to have very strong border security and very expensive weed so if you live there thats a good deal."
saplings,36svsh,booomsnap,3,Fri May 22 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"When I first started, I got 3.5 grams and that lasted me a month. I only smoked on the weekends though."

saplings,36svsh,TripleNubz,2,Fri May 22 06:08:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on your natural tolerance, but anywhere from .1-.3 grams id say depending on how efficiently you smoke it. And by efficiency I mean how you inhale and the smoking device you use."

saplings,36svsh,siggie_balls,2,Thu May 21 22:15:47 2015 UTC,the amount isnt measured in grams. unless your smoking garbage weed. half a gram will fuck up a newbie. a quarter gram will give them  a great experience they will never forget. the first time is honestly probably going to be better than the first time having sex

saplings,36svsh,AceOfReQuiem,2,Fri May 22 14:41:01 2015 UTC,the original question is how many grams to get high.
saplings,36svsh,CopenhagenNatty,1 point,Fri May 22 14:57:28 2015 UTC,Probably around 1/3rd of a gram. Everyone is different though. Could be a little less or a little more.
saplings,36svsh,FriedShrekels,1 point,Thu May 21 22:23:37 2015 UTC,a third of a gram probably.. Im smoke regularly and i still need such an amount. your tolerance wont raise that much :P
saplings,36svsh,Texcali,1 point,Fri May 22 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"I smoke daily and have for a while. I still can get a nice high from less than a half gram. A new smoker will get high off just a couple hits, assuming they inhale correctly"
saplings,36svsh,Hoch,1 point,Fri May 22 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"idk man depends on the potency of your ganja.  9 Gs lasted me more than half a year when i was new.  your very first smoking experience might need about 0.2-0.3 g of bud but that amount you need to get high goes down upon subsequent seshes. However, that happens for a short period of time and you will need a larger amount to get you to the same high.  Avoid smoking everyday to keep your tolerance at the level it is."
saplings,36svsh,leighcar,1 point,Fri May 22 06:05:27 2015 UTC,probably like .2 grams

saplings,36rj38,Dr_Romm,5,Thu May 21 18:13:44 2015 UTC,A few things to consider..   Take small hits to mitigate as much coughing as possible.(If you cough at all. A new vape and some decent bud might be smooth enough you don't cough at all.)  Bring water to drink (again for coughing prevention)  Dark clothes?  I don't know just how stealthy you want to be but good luck.

saplings,36rj38,IwillMasticateYou,1 point,Fri May 22 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"In addition to taking small hits, take big gulps of fresh air after each inhale BEFORE exhaling. This helps cool the smoke in your lungs which makes it less irritating and such less likely to make you cough."
saplings,36rj38,Torus-XY,2,Fri May 22 06:26:19 2015 UTC,"If you want to seem less suspicious, an easy way that I have used before is ""taking a shower"".   Just go into the bathroom with some water and your vape and herb, turn on the fan and shower, lock the door, and take small hits and blow the smoke out an open window. Also, grab some Visene at a local store, they're eyedrops that cost like 2 bucks and take away all redness in the eye (the only time i ever came close to bring caught was when I forgot drops, as red eyes are often the only outward symptoms of highness). The steam from the shower along with the open window and fan going will remove all smell (especially with a vape).  This makes it a lot less suspicious to parents in case they would happen to check your bedroom while you're out. On top of this, showers while high are so fun I find!  Whatever you decide to do, good luck!"

saplings,36rj38,Soluz,1 point,Thu May 21 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"I vape in my bathroom too, and I don't have a window either.  I've come up with a few tricks to keep the smell under control.  First, I put a spare towel and the bathroom mat over the door crack (just make sure this is not visible from the outside!).  Then, every so often, I spray scentless odor remover and fabreeze.  When not inhaling, I place the hand towel over my vape, and I exhale into my bath towel.  I've done this a couple hundred times after my parents have gone to sleep, and I've never gotten caught!  Regardless of where you choose to vape, I hope it goes well.  Just remember to put the eyedrops in before you start, and keep some hard candy with you in case you feel like coughing."
saplings,36rj38,Jinjagalesi,1 point,Fri May 22 04:15:06 2015 UTC,Hey that sounds like an awesome long-term solution. Does the bath towel you blow into not end up smelling like weed though?
saplings,36rj38,garrettttt,1 point,Fri May 22 04:50:18 2015 UTC,"It's worked well for me! The towel's odor has not been a problem. For one thing, smoke from a vape does smell, but it doesn't smell exactly like weed. Also, I'm always sure to spray the towel with my scent-free odor remover and fabreeze (If you want to be extra sneaky, get an empty spray bottle and mix water with a few squirts of your perfume/cologne/body spray; that way it will smell like ""you"" and will be less noticble than a fabreeze scent your parents are not used to). If you're worried about it, buy an extra towel set. I have one spare towel that I put under the door, but having a second spare to cover the vape and blow the smoke into could be helpful."
saplings,36rj38,garrettttt,2,Fri May 22 10:42:28 2015 UTC,You should have a friend over who's smoked before. I think weed's greatest quality is its social aspect

That being said, if you only have so much, and you think you might make better use of it another time...  I think it depends on what kind of sick you are, honestly. If being high will help you get through it better (which it does when it's not a chest/cough thing, in my experience), go for it.

You're setting yourself up to get caught, or possibly something worse. My advice to you is to find a safe spot inside to smoke. At the very least a secluded VERY low traffic area if you just have to smoke outside.  Hope this helps and may the buds be ever in your favor."

But i live in an apartment, and worry more of my neighbours smelling than any thing.   The traffic is very low, maybe one car every minute. But every one in my area is about 70+ Which is a plus cause they're old and in bed by 8-9pm. The bad news is I know they'd be against it.  I've ordered a smoke buddy online, hopefully that will cure my woes."
saplings,36rkku,ld436,1 point,Thu May 21 16:10:21 2015 UTC,Still way less risky to smoke inside. If a cop catches you on the street your fucked but just smelling it from your house they can't do anything.

About 20-30 minutes. You have to wait for your liver to process the THC. In other words, I wouldn't consider redosing until you hit the 45 minute mark.

I had a friend (dealer) shot twice in the chest (survived) during a deal because he was set up to be robbed and had more talent in his two fists than the other guy(s). It's safer to travel in packs. Not to say bullets are less damaging with multiple targets but I'm sure you get the idea. If u notice this is common with this new dealer then have a friend or two tag along with you during pickup.

I asked around and the only guy I could find was a sophomore, so he was a couple years younger. In that situation I felt fine because we had a mutual friend, and he insisted that the dealer was cool.   I sat in his car and everything was fine. If you have no clue who the guy is, I would recommend meeting in a more public place. Ideally you would have a mutual friend who can give a good report."

saplings,36o7zi,Flareprime,6,Wed May 20 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your country/province. However, in both America and Canada law enforcement cannot view the text messages, emails, monitor calls, etc of a person on probation, unless they are given a warrant by a judge to do so. In order to obtain a warrant, law enforcement would have to provide reasonable and specific evidence that the person on probation had committed another crime since their release, that warranted investigating their communications. I believe this is similar in many European countries as well.  So in other words, no, they are probably not actively monitoring his communications unless he's already started violating his probation. However, as a text message the contents could still be accessible at the service provider and on his phone, so if he became subject to another investigation you could indeed be incriminated by the message you sent.  Now, before you start panicing; it all depends on what kind of incrimination we're talking about. If you by incrimination you mean ""I asked him if he had any weed/some pills I could buy for myself"", it's not likely the police will ever really pursue charges against you. People buying small quantities of a dealers substances generally know next to nothing about where he gets it from (it's a trade secret after all ;) ), and so really aren't of much help to the police. When they do go after them, what they usually do is pull them all in, grill them to see if anyone knows anything big, and then let all of the little guys go with a warning. However if you're fairly sure he's being good right now, I would just avoid contact with him (unless he's a good friend of yours); generally they won't bother with anyone who asked to grab months prior and hadn't spoken to the perp since.  If that worst case scenario were to happen, you have two options. Cooperate with them or lawyer up. Generally the best ""catch-all"" advice is to lawyer up, but it can often be worth a gamble to cautiously work with them (but do not trust them on any promises they make and give them as little actual evidence as possible). The thing is, if you lawyer up, they're going to assume you're really scared and probably know something, so they'll throw you to the DA who will try to cut a deal with you (but you'll still end up with charges, because at this point they have to make an example out of you). So if you truly are a little guy, don't hold tons of weed and definitely no hard drugs, it may be worth just telling them that.  Just in case, figure out what you'd say if the cops were to interrogate you in the future. Make sure what you have planned incriminates you as little as possible, and does not incriminate this guy (unless he's an asshole). I would have a line like ""I heard some rumors that he could get some pot, I just wanted to try some for myself"". That way it fits with the fact that you contacted him asking for something illicit, but at the same time you're not actually testifying against him (saying you heard rumors can't be interpreted as testimony that you knew he had drugs, whereas saying you ""knew"" he had them could be).  Ultimately the best general advice in such situations is to lawyer up and not talk at all, as many cops will lie to you during interrogations; giving you the impression or straight up making false promises that you're a little guy they aren't going to chase. However many other cops don't want to have to do the paperwork and court appearances busting every single guy who was grabbing from their perp (which can sometimes be as many as a hundred people for the lowest level of the chain), so if you simply make it clear you just wanted to make a personal purchase and knew virtually nothing about his operation, they'll probably just waste a few hours of your day and let you off with a warning. The key is: be respectful, but don't be a pussy (it's normal to be scared, but do your best to maintain some dignity).  If you're not sure whether you could handle an interrogation alone without slipping up and potentially admitting something bad, or accidentally incriminating yourself for something you didn't actually do, just go with the lawyer option. If you're going to pull the lawyer card that's something you do the moment they arrest you; otherwise you're potentially reducing the effectiveness a lawyer could have.  That all being said, once again if you're a low profile person (you don't sell, you don't smoke tons of weed, you don't keep a stash of hard drugs, you don't associate closely with dealers, etc), it's very unlikely the cops will even ever talk to you. They can investigate you behind your back (view all of your facebook posts, pull your call/txt records, your bank history, etc) and get a fairly good idea of who's important and who's not."

If I get surprised by a test I tell her I can't pee. Tears in eyes. Ask for water to help and drink a gallon but hold my pee till she gets distracted. Then sneak a pee. Drink more water then the next pee should be good.  The first time it happened they told me, 'we're drug testing you!' So I bought the drink from the head shop, or you can get it on line, that is for passing the thc test. and I followed the instructions exactly. I got two bottles, luckily because I jumped the gun from when I thought she would hand me the dreaded cup. It's so gross to chug that drink and I had to do it two afternoons in a row. Ugh. But it worked. It's expensive so next time I had a better feel for how it would go and I drank cranberry juice and still passed.  But what helped most is I never act 'stoned' ,I help out around the house and I try to have lame convos with the parents while maintaining eye contact. I get haircuts with my own money and clean my own bathroom . But most of all I am getting good grades and test results at school. And I owe it all to trees!"

Then once you have the smoke in your mouth let it sit for a few seconds to cool down. Once it's cooled inhale again and get the smoke down into your lungs.   If you let the smoke cool off in your mouth a little bit it should be quite a bit less harsh on your throat and lungs."

The USPS will leave a slip in the PO box you bring to the front counter. They will only release the package to the person it's addressed to. If you addressed it to the dad then I can't guarantee you that they'll let a kid walk off with the package.  If it's addressed to your friend then you should be fine.

That is of course if it truly was undetectable in your saliva.   All in all, I don't think you have anything to worry about."

saplings,36kls2,GetOutOfBox,1 point,Wed May 20 15:13:43 2015 UTC,"In fairness to dealers, I've seen bud with very varying densities; it can be very tight or very fluffy (and hence bigger). If you're in high school, yeah, I'd find a way to verify (get a cooking scale from Walmart if you're worried about sketchiness), as a lot of high school dealers I remember regularly ripped off their customers. Older dealers tend to be more invested in their ""business"" and have more competition, so generally they follow good codes of conduct (as all it takes is one guy to measure your weed to tell all of his friends you're ripping people off, or call the cops on you out of revenge). So if your dealer is older and seems like a decent dude, I would just trust him. The one thing I would watch out for is the ""water trick""; where the dealer mists of flicks water onto the buds to increase their weight temporarily. This is the only one I've heard of older dealers sometimes doing, because unlike simply lying about the measurement, it's not as easy to catch/prove. However if you're vigilant you can often spot it; if the weed always seems slightly damp and/or squishy when you get it, I'd move on to someone else (as it's either just badly treated weed or they're wetting it). Also watch out for your weed mysteriously growing mold regularly, despite being put in a good container. Weed shouldn't get moldy in good storage conditions (cool place and in a opaque and tightly-sealed container), unless it's poor quality (not properly dried and cured) or damp; it normally simply degrades in potency and gets progressively drier over time."

Pretty sure by ""controlled substances"" they mean Xanax, Valium, etc.   I also agree that they probably don't specifically look for THC in standard blood tests. I think they have to specifically tell you it's a drug test or they can't do anything legally with anything they might find.   I'll do more research in the meantime. Thanks!"

saplings,36jv2m,forgottenplace,3,Tue May 19 22:36:49 2015 UTC,All weed tastes different. It's probably fine.
saplings,36jv2m,francis_hunter_brosh,2,Tue May 19 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"Numerous possibilities mostly related to growing environment. Maybe it wasn't flushed properly and retains taste from nutrients, maybe foliars were applied too late and remain on the plant material, maybe it wasn't dried or cured properly, etc."

The problem after that is finding a dispensary that will sell to you without a California ID. Most of them will not. I've never been to one that will, although my guess is that they fall into the category of dispensaries here that you might as well be buying from someone on the street if you're going to go that route.  Furthermore, the recommendation you get from one of those services catering to tourists will likely be for only 30 days. Big deal, you say, you're just visiting. At this point, though, you're out $40 for the rec and calling around on Weedmaps for a dispensary or delivery service that will sell to you. There are easier ways to get what you're looking for."

There are some places that will take you as long as you have some form of a gov't issued ID (i.e. any state license).  Others will require a document with your CA address on it- just look for the ones that don't require this.  If you're still not sure, just call them and ask what they require you to bring to your appointment.  A lot of places have this info posted on their websites under FAQ sections."

saplings,36iugk,Pleatnov,0,Wed May 20 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"You've gotta get a medical card, but it's easy and costs like $100. I don't even think you have to be a resident.

There's been a lot of talk about whether or not the dispensaries have the legal right to take out-of-state patients, and it seems like they do but most just don't want to. On one hand, as a resident I'm kind of ambivalent. On the other, I hate seeing people get ripped off like this. Obviously recreational legalization would solve this."

But on all of them there is a little spot between the filter and the bud that I can't get tight. It bends around that spot if I push it enough. I tried tapping it down and doing the flicking but it didnt help."
saplings,36em2p,Hexavxozy,2,Wed May 20 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"I would recommend rolling a tighter and smaller filter. The shape mainly comes from what your filter is like, so I would recommend adding a tiny piece of tape to it so it doesn't unfold (make sure not to smoke it). I would then recommend rubbing the two edges of the paper up and down to get the weed into a pretty solid tube (if you don't understand what i'm saying i'm sure most of the videos online will show you). Once everything is set up tuck the paper as tight as you can to the filter and then try and tuck the rest and roll up. It's hard to explain online but just make sure to practice as much as you can. I like to practice rolling with gum wrappers with nothing in them when i'm looking for something to do so try that maybe."
saplings,36em2p,420Raisin,1 point,Mon May 18 22:36:48 2015 UTC,So you think putting the filter in before you roll is better? This time I put it in after just because it seemed easier. But when I put it in after the filter was too small.
saplings,36em2p,Blackllama79,2,Mon May 18 23:35:21 2015 UTC,"Most of all, just practice. It's a little bit short and doesn't look that tight. Also, here's a tip I was taught. After you roll your joint, roll it in another paper making it two paper thick. This makes it burn long and slow and stay lit. Happy toking  EDIT: Forgot to mention, when double wrapping, get the papers wet and then ""bake"" the joint. Run it in the flame real quick to dry it, kinda like if you've ever rolled a blunt."
saplings,36em2p,Hexavxozy,1 point,Mon May 18 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! How do I know if its loose? It feels pretty hard when I squeeze it, but does that mean it's tight or just the weed inside is packed together? If that makes any sense"
saplings,36em2p,Blackllama79,7,Mon May 18 22:00:23 2015 UTC,This tip will also make it taste like shit
saplings,36em2p,Hexavxozy,1 point,Mon May 18 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"If the thing doesn't fall apart then it's rolled tight enough, if the herb is loosely packed it'll still smoke, just a bit faster. Adding another paper will mean you are smoking more paper, might not taste too good, but you can try it. I don't really see the point though."
saplings,36em2p,Martient712,1 point,Mon May 18 22:53:49 2015 UTC,I've always used raws and always double roll. Just something that was passed down from friends and it makes the joint burn slower and longer... Raw papers don't taste like anything to me.

saplings,36em2p,Hexavxozy,0,Tue May 19 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"It means when you roll it up, you pack it together and make sure it will fill out the paper. Also, /u/420Raisin is right. Cut, burn, or bite off that paper tip."
saplings,36em2p,sd38,2,Mon May 18 22:52:18 2015 UTC,That's not what /u/420raisin is saying. He's saying that your tip of double rolling will make the joint taste like shit. More paper means you're tasting more combusting paper and less weed. Expert rollers usually roll it so there's as little overlap in paper on the roll as possible.
saplings,36em2p,Hexavxozy,2,Mon May 18 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, less paper the better. If you haven't already check out the Amsterdam roll on youtube you roll the paper backwards and burn off the excess paper to get the least amount of paper possible"
saplings,36em2p,sd38,0,Tue May 19 19:50:04 2015 UTC,I have always used Raw papers and have never noticed any taste before.
saplings,36em2p,Martient712,1 point,Tue May 19 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"actually this is wrong, the more paper you use the more material there is to be burned therefore it burns faster. one of the goals in rolling is to use as little paper as possible mostly due to better taste."

The reason you should absolutely never bring weed on a cruise is that you will not be in the same jurisdiction the whole time. Legal matters are a bit more complicated than you'd think on a ship-- in general, you're assumed to be under the laws of the port of origin, though that doesn't mean that sailing out from a legal state means you'll be legal the whole cruise. You're charged according to proximity. The 'international waters' thing is not quite as simple as you may have been led to believe, for ex, a murder in international waters is a murder under American law-- the port of origin. No lapse of law thing really occurs like that.  So you have too massive of a range, in my opinion, for it to be logical. Because you have the lightest outcome, an ent-friendly crewman advises you to cut the shit and not get caught again. And you have the harshest outcome, detained for drug smuggling in a foreign port. You might think I'm scaremongering, but I'm not. You need to take very serious consideration of your situation first. This has happened before.  I'm not telling you nobody's ever done it. Stoners get stoned wherever they can. But based on the information given, you're not ready to pay this price. You can't even get the oven to yourself for long enough to cook up some eds, you wanna let those same family members see you getting grilled by a customs officer while he waves a felony charge in your face? No way dude. Eds or nothing, but don't let the fantasy of flying high on the seas get the better of you.  Source: Hardcore stoner that did research while considering a position as a crewman."

Cruise ships got a bad rap as being a good venue for drug smuggling, and as a result, are often patrolled. Cruise ships don't want to be considered liable and WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY. They will allow police to SEARCH ANYTHING."
saplings,36dtwl,Neversun,2,Mon May 18 23:21:03 2015 UTC,"Vape pen if you can is going to be the best way.   It's fairly easy to take a vape through airport security, which is rigorous and federally-regulated, and you can do that even in your carryon and onto the plane. I'm not sure how harsh cruiselines are on security, but I doubt they're going to be harder on you than security at an international airport (PHX, LAX, to Canada, etc)   Take the pen's battery and charger and put it into one ziploc, and put your tank/s in another and just plop them into your bag. Most security people know what vape pens are and have been briefed on them, so I wouldn't worry too much.  You should be fine in getting maybe 1-2 pen caps and taking that plus the pen itself onto a cruise. Then, simply smoke when you can and blow downwind off the ship, into a pillow in your room, etc. The smell is different and not easily distinguishable by someone who isn't VERY used to it, so no huge worries on that end either. If vape pens aren't allowed and if you were to get caught with the vape pen somewhere, just say it's non-nicotine juice for an oral fixation you have, or something. They won't take the tank apart to test the liquid inside, they'll simply confiscate it and you'll be out a bit of cash."

saplings,36d92i,Vitastabilis,4,Mon May 18 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"I have been solely infusing, cooking, and eating edibles for a decent amount of time, so here is my ""knowlege"" on the subject. Decarboxylating turns THC-A into THC, which is what you want. If you heat it using the recipe you'd be decarbing, but the process would be slower because it's trapped in a liquid and the CO2 can't escape. It might work but for max effects I'd recommend against throwing in the recipe without simmering in butter. I personally would decarb the kief with an accurate digital thermometer in a small tinfoil wrapped pan (so it's semi-airtight). In my oven with my pans it works  best for me to decarb in a small mason jar in a double boiler at just under 250° for 20-45 minutes depending on the size of the batch. (Google skunkpharm decarb and you should find a graph which helps with timing). Once it's decarbed, mix the kief into a jar of butter heated to around 200, and immediately lower the temp and hover it at anywhere over 175° for as long as you see fit. This infused the active cannabinoids into the butter, and takes anywhere from an hour to a day depending on your batch size and desired effects. Personally, I simmer in butter for as long as possible, at least an hour though. Strain through cheese cloth, or leave the kief in for a weedy taste and possible indigestion. Add the ""budder"" to your brownie recipe and enjoy! I use coconut oil instead of butter because it doesn't burn and I have better luck digesting it in my experience. Good luck, infusions are hard"
saplings,36d92i,flamingjoints,1 point,Mon May 18 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"My current plan is simmer it in a 50/50 mix of water/butter for maybe 20-30 mins then cook it into brownies. Do you think that would work? I don't have a thermometer or anything, so was just gonna wing it."
saplings,36d92i,trav15t,1 point,Mon May 18 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"If you wing it, keep the temp low... No more than 200-220 range throughout the process"
saplings,36d92i,openoceans,1 point,Mon May 18 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"The only issue with doing water/butter is you need to wait for the whole mixture to cool completely so that the butter separates. If you just added the water and butter to the brownie mix that would probably be really really gross haha. What I do is just lightly simmer the bud in however much butter I need for the recipe. You just need to make sure it has 100% of your attention so it doesn't get too hot. I simmer for about 10 minutes, but my recipe is only for 2 cookies. If you're making enough for a box of brownies maybe let it simmer a bit longer.  Also, if your butter starts to smoke/turn too dark, your temp is too high. On my stove I keep it at 3, max 4."
saplings,36d92i,ARQBZAK,3,Mon May 18 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"Oooookay... that is kinda a huge waste of kief IMO, it will serve you much better vaped/smoked since you won't really see a huge difference between that and regular bud. The surface area is so small, it's hard for the fats in butter/oil to absorb all of the THC. 1g is also pretty small, even if it is kief, for the aforementioned surface area thing. I usually use a MINIMUM of 1/4, closer to 1/2.  In addition, no, you don't just add kief to a normal brownie recepie. I'd recommend reading some recipes on pot brownies, you either need to decarb in oil or make butter. And no, you do not need to decarb before adding to butter, the butter process decarbs it while the fats absorb the THC. I would strongly recommend oil, it is much easier, almost impossible to mess up, and in my experience has made just as strong if not stronger edibles. Only downside is that it doesn't taste as good, but all you have to do is keep it on a low heat and stir every 30 mins for a few hours, till the ground bud looks almost black and then filter it out."

Like everything you explained about it is what happened to me, and I even got EXTREMELY bad shaking with it.  This is what I do to help it.  1) DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! Even thinking about not thinking about it will make it worse. Keep your mind on something else that you need to concentrate on.  2) Watch TV, play a video game, watch a movie. I recommend either a cartoon (family guy, adventure time, any cartoon network show really, etc.), or a interesting, chill show like ""Planet Earth"".  3) Grab a blanket(s). I would notice that my hands and feet would get cold whenever this happened, so blankets really helped me out.  4) Make sure you're in a calm, relaxing environment. Paranoia makes it 100000x times worse, so make sure you can relax. Grab some tea if you need to calm down and ONLY smoke if you don't have things planned.  5) Take it slow. Try getting a bowl or rolling a small joint. Even better try to get a MFLB or other vaporizer if possible. With a bong you get a lot of smoke really fast. Once I switched to a bowl the vibrations settled down.  Feel free to PM me with any questions and good luck!    EDIT: Also when these we're happening I was going through some anxiety issues.

It grants instant relief to your eyes when they start getting that 'droopy' feeling, and obviously it makes your eyes as a white as dinner plates. Other brands (visine, clear eyes, other generics...) work well too in my experience, but I guess it is all up to personal preference. Oh, and to answer your question about the rohto colors, I think the spectrum goes (from weakest to strongest) orange? - red - green - blue - white. There may be more colors but green blue and white are the most common.If you want a good laugh, check out the amazon page for white (arctic) rohtos and looks at the reviews lol.  I will add some extra advice though, and that is I do not recommend putting in eye drops unless you absolutely have to. Visine and Rohto's both have an active ingredient called Tetrahydrozoline HCl, which when used excessively can damage your cornea. And by excessive use, I mean like once a week... yeah apparently they are that bad for your eyes. Can't be bothered to look for a source but a few ophthalmologists were preaching this over on /r/trees so I think it's good advice. Hope this helps  Edit: as /u/SSASERTPO pointed out, the red caps are actually stronger than I thought, placing them as one slot stronger than the green caps. The green and red caps also do not have tetrahydrozoline HCL, while the white and blue caps do.  Edit 2: I give too many shits about this but from what I've gathered from the website, the strength of Rohto eye drops should be (in increasing order):  Hydra (White), Cool (Green), Cool Max (Red), Arctic (Other White), Ice (Blue) = Relief (Orange)"

saplings,36bo0z,yolomaster420,1 point,Mon May 18 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm I can't really think of any off the top of my head, but I think a good amount of generic eye allergy relief drops don't have that compound.  Edit: The Rohto green, red, and white (hydra not arctic) do not have tetrahydrozoline HCL, but the green and red caps do have a compound called Naphazoline hydrochloride which is probably just as bad for your eyes but I don't know."
saplings,36bo0z,M1RR0R,1 point,Mon May 18 02:33:57 2015 UTC,Go to a drugstore and look at the packaging. There's a bunch of em without it
saplings,36bo0z,JManSenior918,1 point,Mon May 18 15:08:01 2015 UTC,"What you want is the variety which are labeled as ""Artificial Tears."" They do not cause any damage to your eyes and you can use them as much as you want."
saplings,36bo0z,PrincessBukowski,2,Wed May 20 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"The white Hydra (not Arctic) also does not contain that chemical. They're advertised as for moisturizing the eye only, but I've found that in hydrating the eyes and decreasing irritation, the redness goes as well. It also contains methol like the other formulas, so there's still that burning-then-cooling sensation that makes me feel the ""drooping"" has gone away but, based on the hilarious reviews, I think these must not burn as much as the other versions.   For me, it's worth it to not have to worry about the long-term damage. Not only can it hurt your sight, but since it suppresses the feedback system of the blood vessels in your eyes, it trains them to dilate more and more to let blood into your eyes to counteract the constriction of the eye drops. So, over the time, the natural color of your eyes will be redder and redder, even when not high or actively using eyedrops. In comparison, here's what Dr. Joshua Cappuccilli says about frequent use of lubricating eyedrops: (specifically in reference to Rohto Hydra)  ""An eye drop that is simply a lubricant is theoretically unlikely to cause a dependence or problems with the eye as there is no feedback loop for the body's production of tears that I am aware of... Whoever told you redness reliever was bad to use regularly was right - that medication actually shrinks the blood vessels in the eye and could cause tissue damage."" Source  Hydra's ingredients for anyone interested:  Active Ingredients: Hydroxyethyl Cellulose - 0.6 %  Inactive Ingredients: Boric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Menthol, Polysorbate 80, Potassium Chloride, Purified Water, Sodium Borate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate  So yeah, not dissaude anyone from properly using redness-relievers and whatnot, but I couldn't find all of this info together anywhere when I was researching them awhile ago, which was a pain, so I thought I'd put it right here. :)  Another thing to love about the brand in general is that the packaging is beautiful and smart. The bottle is wide but flat, so it slides into my purse and pocket perfectly without taking up a lot of space. I love the round bottle shape and clean lines, very simple and doesn't really look like eyedrops at a quick glance. The dropper is good, doesn't spill, and does just give one drop at a time, not a dribbly stream.   ETA: And, holy shit, there's a Japanese version with the cutest fucking packaging ever. WITH A MIRROR. I want that."

I will not be getting any other eyedrops after trying these. Did not know about the eye damage though, if that is true, then I might switch.  Also the white ones are not for redness relief, they are for lubrication.   According to their website, the red Rohtos do not contain that chemical: http://www.rohtoeyedrops.com/maximum-redness-relief/"
saplings,36bo0z,yolomaster420,1 point,Mon May 18 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"You are right about the strength of the red caps, but I don't think they are the strongest. Red and greens don't have tetrahydrozoline HCL (tetrahydrozoline HCL is for redness relief, which the white (arctic) and blue caps do have). Just found out there are two different white caps so yeah... The main difference b/w the blue and white (arctic) is that blue and orange caps have zinc sulfate which is an astringent (which helps constrict the blood vessels in the eye), but the arctics have more lubricant. The white hydra's are only for lubrication."

You're taking a drug that causes sedation, so that's what's going to happen when you smoke it. You can counteract the effects to some degree by increasing your activity level or consuming caffeine, and it might decrease as your tolerance increases, but there's really no way to avoid it entirely."

Turns out he lived (what felt like) 2 miles down this sketchy ass dirt road. It was so sketchy I texted another friend of mine something along the lines of ""were going to (insert address) if I text you saying help call the police and send them there"" it was so scary approaching the house but when we we're let in there were 2 guys playing video games. They smoked us up and gave us beer and then we went on the back deck and shot his .30-06 for a while. Then his mom comes in the house screaming about how his dad was out in the woods doing something and his mom kicked us out"
saplings,367aml,mickeymouse4348,10,Sat May 16 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"Well the first time I bought weed I remember waiting probably 45 minutes for the dealer (which prepared me for future dealers, although my current one is prompt which makes me happy). When he actually showed up, he just seemed sketchy as fuck. Big coat, probably 4 or 5 inches taller than me (or felt like it), long unkempt hair that was slicked back, but I managed to feel alright because I was with a couple friends I trusted. Most memorable moment was when he asked if I had the cash ($20) and I said, ""Yeah, but it's two 10's, I hope that's alright"" as if dealers would only take twenty dollar bills or something, I just kind of had a word vomit moment. He ignored it and I got my weed and moved on.  Six months later he is busted by the cops for a bunch of charges, including some heroin and cocaine charges as well as an unlicensed handgun that he had (it was broken, but still illegal for under 21 year olds where I live). His bail was set at something like $600,000. Luckily for him, his dad is a big shot lawyer and he got a lot lighter sentence (don't remember what exactly, the story just kind of went away).  Fast forward two years. I am taking a psychology class. Dude sitting next to me? The same dealer. He has totally changed his life, he no longer deals, he has a daughter, and he's getting his education.  I suppose that is most memorable because it was a rollercoaster of a ride at the time (crazy that someone I knew had a $600,000 bail) and I remember my school was going batshit, the principal had to deal with a million freaked out parents. Hope it was moderately entertaining."

They looked kinda surprised,  but they took the money and gave me the weed.   While Im heading back to my flat I see my dealer's car with a friend of my dealer I had seen one before driving it. It was then that I realized that this was my dealer's guy and the two dudes I just bought weed from were just two random dudes.   I had already spent my money so I didn't want to buy more weed.  I had no idea how to react and I was kinda freaking out so I just kinda kept on walking while pretending not to see him.   The guy was pissed off and tried calling me for the next hour.

saplings,367xo1,KalDavion,10,Sun May 17 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"Subjective. More than anything, it is subjective. Asking the question will net you as many different answers as there are people to hear the question.   First of all, 'what it's like' changes over the course of your relationship with it. The way and the reason that a noob does it is very, very different than the reason a 10-year ent does it. Naturally, they experience it in different ways.  For a noob, my understanding as a noob was that it brought all of your self to the foreground. To explain: All I wanted to do was eat, masturbate, have fun, and make friends with the people around me. At that place in my life, that was all I wanted. My top priorities. My friends were really the same, you know, what else is a teenager going to want.   I also noticed that it made people pretty danged selfish as noobs. Instead of trying to disguise the fact that they wanted to eat all the food, or smoke all the pot, it was right front and center. They'd flat tell you. Themselves were all they could talk about. This doesn't mean that pot makes you selfish; it means that it reveals whether or not you are.  From a purely technical standpoint, noob smoking is like turning all your senses up to 11. OH MY GOD THIS COOKIE, THE TASTE. HOLY SHIT THOSE FLOWERS, THE SMELL. DO YOU SEE THAT TREE? LOOK AT ALL THOSE LEAVES! MY THOUGHTS ARE INTENSE! That's what I think it's like for a noob. Anything you sit down to participate in will be amazing, all media you consume will be colored with a feeling of being overwhelmed. It's amazing, there's nothing like it in the world. Many of us think wistfully of these days, and the feeling of being overwhelmed, amazed. ""Euphoric.""  For vets, I'd say it's more about the fact that it is a time-tested change. You know that the before and after of consumption will be different, and you know (roughly) what it'll be like. At least, you know you want it. Mine and others relationships with it in the later years tended towards the medical, whether medical-psychological or medical-physical. I use it for both reasons. I have a stomach disorder and some anxious disorders, wouldn't you know it, it's great for both of those things. I can get broken up with, beaten to shit, and yet when I smoke a bowl at the end of the day, it's OK. I came home from the hospital when my dad died, I smoked a big fat one. And you know what, I laughed. I laughed and I handled it. That's what weed is to me.  I'm not here to tell you that doing it is the best decision a person can make, that it's a universal good that fixes everything. What I can tell you is that it's worth trying. I can tell you that in the future, it might help you get through things you couldn't have. Whether or not that dependency is a good thing, it is simply true that it has these uses. For some, it may start to foster anxiety, and they'll need to stop. That's just the way it is-- subjective. But full of potential."

Physically your body but mainly your face feels like being in a hot place without the heat.. just intense also tiring and heavy at times. Thoughts become random and subjective, your vision becomes zoomy, sometimes psychedelic thinking can enhance your senses. If you close your eyes when you are very high, patterns/shapes/formations could be seen which otherwise wouldn't be there in your sober state. Sometimes it is easy to drift into a certain train of thought, and breaking it becomes harder. Good music in my opinion is what can enhance the high the most. With music your thoughts become based off of what you hear. You crave food and water as your mouth feels drier, usually because of the smoke. Food is very good paired with music when you are in the state."

Also I find that when I'm high I notice a lot of the smaller details in the world, or maybe it's just these smaller details are more significant and meaningful to me.

saplings,3664kv,JetpackJames,6,Sat May 16 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"For me, a standard ""starter kit"" of sorts would be a good-quality 4-piece grinder, a lighter, and a glass pipe that doesn't have to be big or extravagant. A Tupperware/Rubbermaid container that could fit it all would make transportation easier and keep all of the smell in as well as preserve any goodies you may have in it, so that would really put you well upon your way.  The grinder I linked, I've bought two of them before, one for me and one for a friend. I got mine in purple and his in green, but, unfortunately, it looks as though that this retailer doesn't offer any colors than the standard ""silver"" anymore. Still though, this is a surprisingly excellent grinder. It has a kief catcher and comes with a little kief-spatula, and is made of high-grade, anodized aluminum, meaning it is really durable and won't chip unless you basically put rocks in it. When I first got mine, I brought it to a friend's place (and he's a pretty heavy stoner) and he said he was jealous of it. For 10 bones and free shipping, it really doesn't get much better than that."

I see a lot in this thread about grinders, a grinder is not needed it breaks your herb up easier but your herb will taste better and be more potent if you don't, the kief that accumulates at the bottom of the grinder is the result of the trichromes or the good stuff falling off of the plant matter."

Like in my head while I roll a joint or whatever I think of movies I want to watch, food I want to eat, etc.   If you just get high and don't have anything to do then you're more susceptible to getting bad feelings and thoughts. But if you got stuff to do and you can distract yourself with interesting fun stuff to do when high it's going to be a lot more comfortable and enjoyable.

I'm not sure if you are new to cannabis or just rolling, but if you don't have a tolerance or just don't want to roll huge joints, get the regular 1 1/4 size, not much point in the king size unless the 1 1/4 isn't holding your weed.  Also: Get the tips with your papers. (aka crutch, filter, roach.) You'll want these, they give you something to hold onto in order to smoke the whole thing when it's on its last leg.

I mean I underestimated the shit out of this. A few other guys who had tried it said it was the most powerful shit they'd ever had (made one of them hallucinate) and they were regular smokers.   Anyway, I took what I now know was a fucking ridiculous dosage (normal was a few drops, I took two droppers full). So I don't feel anything for like 2 hours, and then I start feeling a little good. Not unlike an edible high. Except I don't stop getting higher.  I was lying in bed listening to music, and I felt my body melt into the bed. I had no control over my body; I literally could not move. At the end of one song, the audio kind of crackled as it faded out, and I hallucinated that it devolved into a high pitched screaming that seemed to last forever. And this just made me lose my shit, I was giggling forever.   I would close my eyes and see pattern-things that moved in time with the music.

I assumed it was music from cars or other apartments around me, but after a bit I noticed it had changed into a repetitive 8-bit soundtrack that was going on far too long to be real. Then, I started to perceive random skips and cuts in the music, as if there was a speaker wire with a short in it. I decided it was time to go inside, and for an hour or so I continued to hear similar audio distortions and modulations. It was a bit scary in the moment, but looking back I find it very interesting and I wish I could experience it again.

This usually works best with the more malleable concentrates.   4) rubbing it onto your gums or eating it does not work unless it has been decarboxilated.   5) if you still have some stuck to the paper then put it in the freezer and it should just break off when you take it out  Edit: formating

I guess it would be a good stealth piece.   We used both bud and wax with it. No problems using bud.  When you first get it heat up the bowl a couple times and wash it thoroughly. It tasted weird at first.   I would save up and get something bigger though. The $40+ pieces from DHGate are not bad at all.

What is the technique to using it, just a long slow inhale? Do I light the herb like I'm lighting a joint or do you hold the flame on it the whole time? I think I have to lift the bowl out after inhaling or something to clear it? I'm not sure exactly what I have to do here in what order haha.   Like if I handed you this and you were to use it what would you be doing step by step?"
saplings,366yze,Stank_55,2,Sat May 16 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Okay so first, pack a bowl. Everyone has their own method,  but I tend to pack a layer of herb to cover the whole. I find it cherries easier and requires less lighting later on. Then cover your original pack with as much herb as you think you want or can handle. Then, place your mouth on the pipe and inhale before lighting. Make sure it bubbles properly, that's how you determine how strongly to inhale. When it fills white (or yellow depending on the herb/how clean of a hit), pull the bowl out and inhale very hard. Exhale, and proceed to cough your lungs out! edit: I'm a [3] and missed a few questions. Filling with water is pretty easy, just pour it down the pipe where you put your mouth,  or down the hole where you put the bowl,  it depends on the pipe. For lighting,  generally a 2-3 second light is more than enough. It mostly depends on your preference and how big of a hit you can handle. Or if you packed a nice bowl, the size of the hit totally depends on the length of your draw."

If you start to get tired or paranoid, head back home and light up again, and then turn on some Planet Earth and grab your favorite munchies.

If it smells like febreeze just make an excuse why it smells like that, but it should be gone within 6 hours for sure.  Ozium is better, if you can get it. But try to limit exposure.  Wash any fabrics that had a lot of contact (bedsheets, clothes). Its gonna be a bit of a pain to clean a carpet/curtains if the smell is on them, but you could probably just febreeze it then let it air outside.."

Well this car pulls up and sees us smoking weed so they ended up calling the cops. Cops pull up and me and my friends fucking book it across the field to my house.

I like philosophy and abstract stuff like that when I'm SOBER, so smoking doesn't really bring me any NEW insight in that area.  Essentially, weed allows you to follow a thought down the rabbit hole a lot further than you normally would.  Normally, a part of your brain would say ""that's too weird"" and your line of thinking would end, or you would get distracted by something else.  Weed removes that.  However, the downside is that it's harder to draw conclusions from your thoughts when you're high, and tie everything, because your mind is always going off on rabbit trails.  I would encourage you to write down the topics you think about when you're high and read about them when you're sober again."

Maybe smoke less of a heavy indica strain to avoid these thoughts. Also learning to be mindful will help you avoid thinking about these things.

saplings,364oud,OldHippie,1 point,Sat May 16 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Thats how I did my very first grow about 7 years ago. I got better genetics about 5 years ago and havent looked back since. More importantly, I learned something, which i'm sure most people have a minor understanding.. good weed is all about the grower.   I had been buying schwag regularly about 12 yrs ago. Didnt have the funds to get the high quality. Eventually, started saving seeds. No clue as to why. Fate, for real. I found ICMag.com, bought Marijuana Horticulture by Jorge Cervantes from the Gardening section at Barnes & Noble, and my journey began.   I have a few albums+pics at  http://anthonytaurus.imgur.com  Schwag seeds are great to learn with. Cheap and easy to get. And, if you do it right, youll be very happy with your results. Once you realize what you can do with schwag seeds, you will be fiending for better genetics."

Experience always beats education. So, do it and learn it. Get that practice with cheap/free seeds. Learn cloning, how to keep a mother, and go so far as breeding and selfing for feminized seeds. When you pick up thise good genetics, youre gonna be making your own seeds and keeping your own seed library. If you need that help, ICMag.com, #1 marijuana grow forum in my opinion."

saplings,363fwf,gankaskon,5,Fri May 15 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"Depends how windy it is on any given day.  Short answer: It might be difficult to gauge without seeing how close your neighbors are to your porch.  Most of the time the smell will dissipate in the wind.  But if you're in a community that will start eyeballing you even if they think they smelt it, best to maybe use a sploof (toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets) or something like ozium (smoke-off spray) for the area.  Personally, I'm a fan of sploofs. Neighbors just think you're doing laundry."
saplings,363fwf,xxusakomoonxx,2,Fri May 15 20:06:48 2015 UTC,Sploof. Makes it smell like fresh laundry.

saplings,363fwf,Sh0elace,1 point,Sat May 16 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"tl;dr The biggest sources of smell are pieces that were smoked out of/are still smoking and dank weed. So keep them in airtight jars.  Just sit outside, and enjoy. Try to blow it up and away from any open windows.  If you smoke inside regularly, it will have a distinctive smell, but if any smoke blows in from a single person smoking outside it will be minimal, and pretty much go away immediately. From the sounds of it, you don't seem like you are worried about concealing it from anyone who lives in the actual apartment with you, so the smell shouldn't be a problem.  Unless you live in Saudi Arabia, I doubt anyone is going to get to worked up about the smell of weed (especially if you're just one person going for a smoke). I don't know what the police are like in your town, but I doubt they'll respond to a call from someone reporting the smell of pot in the air.  I recommend picking up a couple of these from pretty much any store  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFSU0csFL.jpg  I bought a small one and a big one for 2 dollars each at Wal-Mart, and they completely cut the smell out.  If you use a pipe, leave it outside in one of those jars.  Keep your weed in another jar, only open it to get a few nugs to bust up.  Personal experience:  I live with my brother, and he knows I smoke weed. I smoke outside, so I leave my pipe in a jar outside. The only time he mentions any smell is if I exhale the last hit, and walk inside with my mouth still smoking, or if I open a brand new bag and have it open for an extended period of time."

saplings,363fwf,leon__furious,1 point,Sat May 16 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"Do you live with your parents or her parents? If you are just worried about them coming over and smelling it, the smell won't linger very long unless you are ripping fat bong hits directly into your window and leaving smelly open sacks of weed lying around.  If they tend to show up unannounced all the time, just make sure your windows are closed when going outside, and leave everything in airtight jars. I also recommend buying a ""smoking jacket"", which is basically a cheap hoodie you put on to go outside and smoke weed in, that way your other jackets remain smell and burn free."
saplings,3642ga,Afrew,3,Fri May 15 23:06:52 2015 UTC,"Would it soak into the carpet or anything at all?   For how long? If you smoke once in that room, the smell will leave. If you smoke every day for the rest of your stay there, the carpet might begin to retain the smell of weed.  As far as containing the smell, I've smoked in my parents' bedroom when they would go out of town and I kept the smell in the room by closing the door and smoking by an open window. The room would smell for many hours after, but as long as I kept the window open and the door shut until morning (I smoked at night more often) the smell would go away and never leak into the rest of the house.  Based off of that, you'll probably be fine smoking in your room with the window open and fan blowing air out, the smell shouldn't leak into the rest of your apartment or the hallway. I'm assuming you live on your own?"
saplings,3642ga,TheSteaky,2,Sat May 16 11:55:45 2015 UTC,"I have no more than 1 smoke session per week over the course of 1 day. With that said, I'll usually pack my bowl and then take a few hits, chill for about 45 minutes, take another few hits, and then repeat until either I'm done with the bowl or if I'm too stoned. I don't always smoke at my place either. I'll sometimes go to one of my friends' places and get high over there. Anywho, if it's only one day per week, but I might smoke 20 or so hits on that one day, should it still be fine?  I live with my girlfriend, by the way. She doesn't smoke at all, but is fine with me doing so as long as I am stealthy about it."
saplings,3642ga,TheSteaky,2,Sat May 16 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"Are we still talking about smoking in your room? I'll just reiterate what I said about your room, I think your plan for smoking in there will be just fine.  Talking about your main room with the carpet? It'll smell like weed for a while, less time if you keep doors and/or windows in your apartment open. I don't think that smoking one day a week will leave a smell the rest of the week, however if you are going to be living in that apartment for a while you might consider having a carpet cleaning service clean it for you every few months or so. I don't think you'll need to, but if you want to be extra sure it's an option.  If I didn't answer your question, feel free to ask again, I'm at a [3] right now so not sure how helpful I'm actually being."

saplings,3642ga,Teecu,1 point,Sat May 16 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"So, I am currently in a scenario similar to this. First, is there any chance that the person you're hiding this from will enter your room? If so, imo your goal should be trying to stop your room from smelling.   Anyway... First, the less smelly, the better.   Edible/ vape > bong/pipe > joints.  Let's assume you are using either a bong or pipe.   1) pack only one hits worth. Nothing will stink your room up like a cherried bowl burning.  2) Your pipe likely reeks on it's own.. Put it away immediately.  3) blow air from the room --> outside, and make sure it's a strong fan.   4) add a new smell. I don't think using something like axe is a good idea. Use air fresheners/ scent removers. Also, scented candles / incense.   5) don't leave room/ open door for at least a good 10-15, if you can.  6) if you want to be extra meticulous, wash hands with soap, wash face, and eat or drink something that will ensure that your breathe doesn't smell.  If you don't already, buy a mason jar to contain your stuff  Any questions just ask"

I usually do this with my tiny bong since it's slide has such a small bowl. I absolutely hate Axe. But we frequently use incense and such recreationally anyway. Good tip. I didn't think of that.

Our third friend, the one we were smoking out, just didn't say much of anything for almost an hour, she was completely gone.

Now, on another note, the nature of weed is that it's a psychedelic. It makes you question things that you normally wouldn't, it may bring up things that you don't really want to face, which could result in a sort of depression especially if you're prone to it. Although this is generally only happens with high doses. But you don't have to worry about this, it's a natural part of life that weed can 'induce'. Ultimately, it's for the better and therapeutic. I may be exaggerating this effect, however it's true for me and I don't regret smoking as much as I did one bit."
saplings,361790,tRedditAccount,2,Fri May 15 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"The best answer I can give you is that, since Marijuana has been illegal for so long and classified as a Schedule I drug, the government hasn't allowed enough research for us to truly say. But by experience, you should realistically wait to smoke around 18-22. At 16 you can probably get away with it once a week."

It also has a very calming effect and can reduce the paranoia that some people get.  Another thing you can mix is mint.  It's rather tasty.  And, if you want to really conserve your stash, they mixing lemongrass in, but in small quantities.  It is even harsher than mugwort.  However, it also contains the same thing as mangoes: Myrcene-β, which will intensify your high.  TLDR:  Mugwort: Tasty, but tiring and harsh. Mint: Tasty.

They fucking smell after a while no matter how much you clean them; taking care of them and rinsing it out after each session helps but will only slow the inevitable. General cleaning is a nightmare, as the recommended glass method (iso and salt) can fog acrylic plastic. Ultimately, consider acrylic disposable.  They don't cool the smoke as much as glass, but at 8"" you probably won't notice much of a difference; on longer pieces you will. I'm also not a fan of how hot metal bowls stay.

saplings,3608a7,ld436,2,Fri May 15 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"They are called 'concentrates', and they are exactly as they sound; concentrated THC/CBD oil in various degrees/purity.  Making your own can be pretty dangerous if you don't know what you're doing (i.e. you can set your kitchen on fire pretty easily), so typically people just buy it.    As for how it is smoked, there are a few different ways.  Like you mentioned, people will sometimes coat their joints/blunts/spliffs.  Usually though, most people will take a dab of concentrate (hence the name 'dabs', a common reference to concentrates) and hit it with bongs and other various 'dab rigs' (pieces that have been set up for concentrates vs. normal flower).  What this means is instead of a normal bowl like you would see for loading flower, something called a nail is used in its place, and heated with a blow torch.  After it's heated, the said dab that was scooped earlier is lowered onto the heated bowl, and you take a hit as it melts and turns to steam.  This is considered a much cleaner and healthier way of smoking.  Here is a gif of the process after the nail is heated.    Keep in mind that since dabs are a concentrated version of flower, one dab of wax will get you higherthanamotherfucker"

Eventually the heat will melt the resin a little bit and the movement of the water will start pulling big chunks off the piece that will flow out of the holes and into your sink.  This should get the big pieces off and a lot of the brown residue will be gone.  It's not ""like new"" clean, but it's clean enough to smoke out of now.  You can first fill a container with the hot water and let the piece soak a bit first for best results.  After I do the water part I use alcohol and salt.  This is optional but is the best way to get the inside scrubbed clean.    And no, salt does not dissolve in alcohol."

There's a makeup tool called a spoolie, and they make the absolute best bowl/glass cleaners I've ever tried. You can buy them in bulk packs on Amazon, or you can go into a Sephora or Ulta and grab some of the ones they have there to test mascara with. Non-conspicuously, of course. Dip your spoolie in some rubbing alcohol, and scrub away at the bowl. The absolute best part is that it's just the right size to fit inside the tube and scrub it out clean."

saplings,35ze04,D1STURBED36,3,Thu May 14 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"You can smoke these last few times, but, just to be extra safe, I wouldn't smoke anymore after that until you pass your drug test.   Since you haven't smoked for months, you already don't have anything in your system, so smoking that 2g within the next few weeks shouldn't be a problem to clear out as long as you do at least a little bit of work. After you smoke for your last time, start drinking a lot of water, and start doing some cardiovascular exercises. The water won't do a whole lot, but it will help. The exercise is really what'll get rid of the THC in your system. Some studies show that doing about 8 hours total of cardiovascular endurance exercises per week can boost the removal of THC by about 46%, which is definitely nice. Sweating in general is a good way to purge your body of gross junk and chemicals.  I hope you got your date right with July 1st, because if you meant June 1st, you won't make it if you start smoking again."

saplings,35ze04,paranoidsillythings,1 point,Fri May 15 04:58:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly it all depends on how long you've been smoking, how often you exercise, etc. If you're only going to smoke a couple time in the next couple weeks I would say start exercising when you're not smoking, and drink double the water you do now. A urine test can only test back two weeks (depending on the test you use it may differ) so to be safe I would quit cold turkey 3 weeks before your test if not a month before to be really safe. Also, 2 gs in a week isn't that much for a regular smoker, so I think you'll be fine as long as you take the necessary precautions."

I got a pretty small bong (although its bigger then those, but not to much) and honestly i dont really enjoy it and hardly use it, partly because i live with my mum, so i dont really want to keep it around my room (ATM its in a discreet box) and filled with water. Another reason is i got a vaporizer and dont have a whip, so i dont really tend to use it now. It performs okay, but after using a friends way bigger bong (approx triple the size) it performs a lot better. It feels better to use (thicker, milkier more impressive hits.. not really to into that but its pretty fun with a group), but the main part that i like about the bigger bong is that the mouthpiece is bigger, i didnt realize how much i didnt like my bongs mouthpiece (? or mouth.. section.. whatever) until i used the bigger bong and went back to mine, its not just preference either as the bigger bong hits smoother (even though its relatively the same design, downstem into water and to your mouth, no percs). My small bong you have to put your lips really close together, so its like the smoke is hitting 1 part of your throat, while the bigger bong i can open my mouth a lot more, so the smoke feels like its a lot more spread out and easy to take in. Bold part is my main issue with smaller bongs.  Perhaps you could just get 1 bigger bong, rather then 2 small ones?"

I'm not the first nor last to singe my bangs, eyebrows, and eyelashes from short bongs haha.  The perc and ice catcher are both good- those are good things for a bong to have (the more percs and ice, the smoother the hit).  And last but not least, thicker glass is way better.

There are some indicators that may indicate the quality of weed, but it can be a crap-shoot even then.  The indicators generally include how sticky your fingers are after handling the nugs, how dusty with trichomes it is, how dank it smells, and, generally, whether it is still slightly damp or not. Going with those, you want nugs that are sticky, dusty, smells strong as hell, and, at least in my experience, decently dry.   Color, size of nugs, and density don't really have anything to do with quality. If anything they only indicate how the weed may have been transported."

At least that's what I thought until I read that an edible (I assume that's what ""space cake"" means) didn't do anything to you. I think you actually correctly inhaled the vapor and you weren't ready for it maybe? It can be intense if one doesn't know what to expect.

Don't ask for a cigarette (unless you want one obviously) ask them something else like where some bullshit is. Then say you're asking because you are new in town. Then talk about other stuff. Then tell that one story great story you have when you were high. Start off weaving it into the conversation.  EXAMPLE: You: Are you from here?   Them: yes, but I lived in Blah Blah for a while. OR no, I'm from blah blah.   You: I've been to blah blah. Oh man, the time I went there... then tell that one really great story you have of when you were high.   If they partake, they will most likely reply with a story or some indication that they smoke.   You: Oh man, it's hard being new in town, lost all my connections. Try your best not to flat out ask where they get their cannabis. It's off putting. Let them get to that point or hang out more then keep complaining about having too much money and not enough weed.   I'd actually recommend hanging out at a hookah lounge and finding friends there. They don't have to be your best friends just the friends that you networked with. I talk to strangers a lot anyways so this might be harder for you but you really need to strike up convos with lots of people to weed out your new friends.

First guess would be to vibrate the kief down into the bottom chamber for collection. I know my titanium grinder has a chamber for that and I shake it and use a tool to help it pass the screen.

All you gotta do is fill the very bottom of the bong with water, just enough so that the downstem is immersed and when you inhale from the top it creates bubbles. Then grind or pick your bud into small pieces and then load it into the removable bowl. Next whip your lighter out and start slowly inhaling (emphasis on slowly) while you hold the lighter near the weed. The smoke will begin to stream through the water and fill the bong. Keep inhaling as slowly as you can (just enough so you're making bubbles with the water) and when you're ready to clear it just remove the bowl and pull all the way through with your lungs and hold it for at least 3 seconds. Congratz, you're about to be high as fuck."

The only issue I might have with it is the price, I think you might be able to get a better deal but if money isn't a huge issue or the price seems reasonable to you then your search is over!  If you want a really smooth toke just add some ice into the top of it. That'll make it reaaal easy on your lungs."

saplings,35s2x1,POTpourri12,8,Wed May 13 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"Hey man I'm by no means a tree expert, but I've had depersonalization and still have it a bit. At first I'm not gonna lie, it is hell. But only if you think about it. It doesn't happen to most people but if it does, just don't think about it, as hard as it may seem. When it was constantly on my mind it felt almost like I was on a bad trip. I couldn't do anything. So I wouldn't worry about it and you would be good. It happens as a result from anxiety and weed or other drugs can bring it out. I've learned to live with it. Hope this helps somewhat :)  Edit: Oh yea I didn't say how it feels. It's really hard to explain but it feels like you're in a bubble. Like you're a ghost almost and in a dreamlike state. Also like a said, similar to a bad trip."

God it's so weird, time is so slow, and oh god, it's weird."
saplings,35s2x1,PM_NUGGETS,1 point,Thu May 14 14:08:33 2015 UTC,I feel like it's actually common. Cause I notice that people change when they start smoking. And when I explain it to my friends they say that they had it when they started. It's pretty damn shitty when you worry about it too much tho.
saplings,35s2x1,y2kcasualty,7,Thu May 14 17:58:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not an expert at all, but here is my personal experience with it.  Firstly, depersonalization happens to me in my normal day to day life when I'm sober. In general it's usually a few times per week minimum. This started happening to me way before I started using any drugs or even drinking, so it's not some weird PCP-laced weed mythological crazy thing. I can elaborate on why I have it if it helps you understand or if you're curious or whatever.   ANYWAY, at this point I'm basically used to depersonalization and other dissociative shit, and I expect it to happen. It interferes with my life, but it no longer freaks me out or scares me.  When it happens to me sober, it's more weird and confusing than anything. It's difficult to describe. If I look in the mirror, I don't recognize myself. I am in touch with reality enough to know that I am looking at me, but it feels like I'm seeing myself for the first time ever and I'm objectively looking at a stranger. Logic doesn't go out the window, and I know what is/isn't real, but everything feels off.   It feels like the world is happening around me instead of to me if that makes any sense. I feel completely disengaged. It feels like nothing is real, which means I also feel like nothing matters. Sometimes I feel intense panic or sadness (usually if it's happening after a panic attack), but most of the time I feel numb. When I'm dissociated, it feels like I could get hit by a car or catch on fire and be like ""whatever I guess"". Basically, the overall vibe is detachment. What is normally personal or emotional becomes impersonal and objective. It's like my brain is floating three feet away from head, and my physical body is not me.  I feel like my body becomes a character in a movie and I'm watching shit happen. I'm the audience instead of the person I actually I am. I move, but feel like I'm not the one doing it even though I know I am. I dissect myself like a stranger that I have extensive information about. I'll be watching myself and thinking things like, ""This is what that person needs to do."" or ""Wow, they seem hopeless, it's really sad and I hope they figure it out.""  The weirdest part imo is that I forget details about myself. A few weeks ago while this was happening I forgot how old I was and had to spend five minutes mentally figuring it out. I'm 22. I know that. It's not like I've lost count. All of it comes back once I'm not experiencing this, but it's pretty common for me to forget most of what I did during the time I was dissociated/depersonalized/whatever. I think because what I'm doing feels secondary/unimportant since I feel like I'm not the one doing it.  SO, WEED.  When I smoke weed, it's pretty common for this to happen to me. The experience is basically the same, except I'm more chill about it. Sometimes it's more intense without being more negative, because when I'm high I can roll with it better. Usually it's just kind of like, ""Oh okay, this is happening, alright, I'm going to watch Heathers"" because I'm not as scared. When I'm sober depersonalization is like 3/10 scary, when I'm high it's like 2/10. Again, I'm pretty used to this. A lot of people get way more freaked out because they aren't.  I don't know what causes depersonalization with weed, I just know what causes it in general. But I've gotten it from smoking like half a fucking bowl before because my tolerance is stupidly low and I'm prone to it. I assume it's more common with low tolerance, but I'm not sure. It's not really worth seeking out imo, but I'm obviously biased since depersonalization has had a negative impact on my life overall.  Physically it's not damaging, and mentally it doesn't have to be damaging. Some people panic when it happens because they feel like they're losing their mind or THE WEED WAS LACED or whatever, which makes the experience way worse but really if you can accept that it's happening and roll with it everything should be fine. If you get it and want it to stop, looking at personal shit like your ID or anything you have strong emotional attachment to can help. When it's caused by weed, it usually goes away before the high even ends for me, so I don't usually do anything about it.  The only time it's ever freaked me out, I had smoked a lot more than usual, and felt like I was in a former friend's house for a couple minutes. I haven't seen this person in five years, and they were awful to me. So I got scared because I felt like I was 16 again, and this person was going to come hurt me. I had to repeat ""I am 22, I have a college degree, I live in an apartment"" to myself multiple times (in my head) like a fucking affirmation to remind myself of what year it was. This sounds scarier than it actually was. It didn't last very long and I'm not going to lose sleep over it, but it was weird for sure.  Hopefully that helps, I'm sorry it's long as hell. I have a hard time being succinct. If you have any questions or whatever feel free to ask."
saplings,35s2x1,DrQuaid,1 point,Wed May 13 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not say anything, but it is not just with low tolerance. Trust me, my tolerance is not low."
saplings,35s2x1,y2kcasualty,2,Wed May 13 06:49:27 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I just kind of assumed it was a low tolerance thing because my gut reaction to anything abnormal that happens to me is usually ""it's because I'm a fucking pussy"", but I wasn't sure. Thank you for saying something."
saplings,35s2x1,Skizzius,3,Wed May 13 14:28:28 2015 UTC,"Smoking weed a few times a week with your buddies or even by yourself isn't going to change you. It may actually make you more social and outgoing. Weed isn't addictive, but the lifestyle of being high all of the time is. Don't get to the point where you're smoking every day and not doing anything productive. Moderation is the key brother."

saplings,35s2x1,newsweeden,1 point,Wed May 13 02:25:08 2015 UTC,It only happens to me for the first 15-30 minute of my high. It's like that feeling when someone wakes you up by repeating your name.

I find throwing on some music works as I just focus on that. Happy toking.

For me and the majority of the ones I have had here in Washington the high is a body/head mix it seems. It typically starts out with my throat tingling a little bit and then progresses out from there. I love the feeling, not only does it make the pain go away but I just feel amazing and so intune with my body and surroundings. I am found often more than not asking/stating to those around me that how the hell can something this awesome and not bad for you be illegal. :)   If I had a 110mg edible I personally would put it into 1/3rds or 1/4ths and start there. We are lifted a good part of most days except when at our day jobs and 25/30mg is a great workable amount."

saplings,35satd,Glorakoth,2,Wed May 13 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"There are primarily 2 reasons for seeds in weed.    The female plants were allowed to be pollinated by male plants, which caused the growth of seeds.  The plant started off as female and for some reason (chemicals were introduced, stress during the early stages of growth, etc) it ""hermied"" and produced seeds all on its own.   Both will cause your buds to be less potent  than buds that have no seeds at all.   If you see this it is called a calyx. They are the most potent part of a sensamilla (grown without seeds) cannabis plant. the little orange hairs you see on your buds grow from here, and this is where pollen is collected to form seeds.   A lot of growers can tell that their plant is near harvest when the calyx(es) swell up.   If you are finding little white hard things in your buds, they could be immature seeds."

saplings,35rae1,AveryTheOctopus,3,Tue May 12 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"Also if you were wondering how my first time went I didn't know to wait between each hit so I hit a pipe ""successfully"" 3 times and a blunt the same amount in like, 10 minutes. My face got numb and everything, for a second I thought I was having an allergic reaction. Then me and the friends I was smoking with went to taco bell, came back and laughed ourselves to sleep watching The Interview"
saplings,35rae1,runicspeer,2,Tue May 12 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Avery, Drink atleast a gallon of water for the next few days, sweat, go workout, skate, play sports or whatever as much as you can, Although it's your first time THC can stay in your system as long as two weeks, however its very very very unlikely.  For the most part you should be fine :)"
saplings,35rae1,DMagnific,2,Tue May 12 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"while I appreciate the response my test is tomorrow so I don't think exercising now is a smart idea (I did a bunch yesterday when I found out I was gonna be tested) since I'm trying to keep the THC, which is stored in the fat I would be burning, out of my urine starting now. But I have definitely been chugging water and will continue do so so!"
saplings,35rae1,lotiro,2,Tue May 12 22:26:42 2015 UTC,Yea dilution will be the best method but make sure you don't drink too much water. If the creatine levels in your urine are too low (from drinking tons of water) they will fail you automatically. So drink a lot but not way more than is reasonable for a person to drink.
saplings,35r81i,LeakForums,2,Tue May 12 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend driving whilst you're high - not if you've only smoked a few times. I drove high the first few times I smoked and even as my tolerance increases, I'll never do it again.  That said, the best thing you can do is relax. Don't overthink things, just go with the flow and let it happen, you'll enjoy yourself. As for smoking from a mini-bong being stronger, I can't tell you with any definitive, but I can tell you it'll feel different to smoking a joint (and probably from a pipe, I'm not sure) - it'll be smoother and probably cooler because of the water filtration, so you can fill your lungs up a little more and because of that, it'll probably feel stronger."

When I've driven high before I was probably more on the lines of coming off of it. Not sure how it will be this time. The only thing I've smoked out of has been a bowl, so is the mini bong much different?"
saplings,35r81i,ladispewt,1 point,Tue May 12 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"I guess if someone has to drive, try to make it the most experienced smoker, that way you can at least minimise the risks.   A bong shouldn't be too different (I've never smoked from a bowl/pipe, so I can't be sure), but it has a few things you'll have to get to grips with. There's a sort of 'technique' to smoking from a bong, which you'll pick up very quickly but the benefit of a bong (in my opinion, anyway) is that you can 'milk' it, by filling it with smoke before you uncover the carb (the little hole on the side) and inhaling all the smoke. I'm hardly the best person in the world to give advice on this since I'm a sapling myself, but in essence, I doubt you'll have much trouble with a bong coming from a bowl.  Good luck and happy toking!"

saplings,35osjc,Blackllama79,1 point,Tue May 12 11:26:08 2015 UTC,"The $/g price of both of those deals is about the same, so you won't be saving money on the half oz deal, you'll just have more weed.

saplings,35osjc,bacon_trays_for_days,1 point,Tue May 12 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"So a lot of dealers nowadays(in my tiny corner of the world at least) don't offer discounts when buying in bulk. It's either something like 50$ for a Henry no matter how many you get, or its simply 10$ a gram for how many grams you want. For both those  amounts you listed you're getting them for around 11$ a gram, with no real savings between them. So buy either amount. It's good prices as long as the stuff gets you high! 🚬💨"
saplings,35osjc,eternalfantasi,-5,Tue May 12 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"The deals are decent for a sapling. Once you really know your 'nentwork' in your area, you'll probably be able to find deals that are somewhat cheaper.  I live in Northern California, have been smoking for four months, and I've been able to find deals as low as $100 an OZ, but most people I know have no problem paying as much as $320 for an OZ, which is what you're paying.  I'd take the deal. At this point in your smoking life, it's worth it."

saplings,35nxoz,undergroundathiest,6,Tue May 12 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"Either you're inhaling incorrectly or your weed is poor quality. Pull the smoke from the j to fill your mouth (halfway if you're not confortable) then take a deep breath bringing the weed smoke as well as fresh air deep into your lungs. Hold for a few secs and release. I didn't feel anything my first time either but by the second or third time the effects were full blown.  Edit: you might just not feel high but that doesn't mean you aren't. Maybe you're experiencing a head high, which is not physical so you can't feel it. Usually you have random thoughts and can't remember them for long/focus on a single thing, but effects vary. Best I can experience it is your brain takes a break from all the thinkibg and just relaxes."

I thought she was sort of used to getting high, and she was leaving the country soon, so I rolled a fat ass blunt. After two or three hits, I was giggling and being high and I noticed she wasn't feeling anything. I explained the breathing technique and she then rocketed to a [level] that I hadn't ever seen before. Good luck dude!"

saplings,35nc2e,metwo3four,2,Mon May 11 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"If you spill a jar filled with buds it's not that big of an issue, simply pick them back up. If you pre-grind though, and you spill over all that weed it's going to suck and probably leave a mess. Thats really the only reason why I leave them be and grind the buds when I need to. Also someone told me it dries up quicker when busted, I don't know how much truth is in that though.. I'm sure someone will clarify that.     Most websites that sell weed related accessories usually have discreet shipping and tell you. I'm pretty sure a package from amazon is discreet also in the sense that it will just have amazon written right on it with so other addressing information. As far as grinders go you shouldn't have to look too hard, if you're looking for a kief catcher they are usually categorized under triple-chambered grinders. You really don't need to be paying $50 for a grinder (they're usually just really big or made up of a stronger metal like titanium or something) a $10-20 one will serve you well just fine.. unless you like all that fancy stuff."

I'm sure someone will clarify that.   I've kept them both ground and unground, and I honestly haven't noticed a difference between the two in terms of dryness. I do generally keep everything in an airtight jar though.  The only reason I ever keep it ground up is for quick loading of a bowl. Sometimes not having to deal with that extra step is nice."
saplings,35nc2e,chillymoose,1 point,Tue May 12 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"If you do spill, take a vacuum hose and put a thick shirt over it and go over the spill to recollect it! This works for me, at least."
saplings,35nc2e,sci_comes_1st,2,Wed May 13 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"People often say that bud dries up quicker once it's ground, but I've never really noticed that. I can't speak for long periods of time but I almost always grind more weed than I actually need to fill a bowl, so then it's left for a few days until I smoke again, at which point I'll grind more weed and have some left over in an annoying cycle. I think as long as it's kept in an airtight container (a mason jar would be great) you should be fine.  I can't see a reason why any tree-related website would ship stuff in clearly marked packaging - discreetness is important here, so you should be fine. I don't think I've ever had a delivery from Amazon (of anything) come in a non-discreet package, and when I ordered my piece and grinder (from an online headshop and eBay respectively) both were shipped discreetly.   All grinders do near enough the same job, so I'm not sure what the main advantages of expensive grinders are over their cheaper counterparts. I bought my grinder from eBay for something like £7 and it does the job perfectly well whilst accumulating a nice amount of kief. Don't spend big money on a grinder would be my advice, save it for a piece or a vape or whatever you fancy."
saplings,35nc2e,ladispewt,1 point,Mon May 11 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"When I bought my first grinder, I bought this one from Ebay. Only 10 dollars, and free shipping, which is really excellent for a grinder like this. I got mine in purple and my buddy one in green, but, unfortunately, it appears that they do not offer any colors besides the standard ""silver"" nowadays. Still though, I think the silver looks pretty excellent.  Anywho, this is an excellent grinder. It's 4 pieces (which means it has a kief catcher) and is made of strong aluminum, meaning that you'd really have to beat it for it to get damaged. It also comes with a little ""kief spatula"" in the bottom. After I bought this grinder (when I was still a newb) I brought it to my friend's apartment who is a very seasoned toker. He was really impressed by it and said he was even a bit jealous of it, lol. Since it's from Ebay, the packaging is always really discrete, especially since for this listing it says ""Herb Grinder/Crusher"" and not ""Weed/Marijuana Grinder"" or whatever. I live by myself though, so I don't have to worry about my parents flipping out.  As to your storage question, I leave ground-up bud in my grinder all the time, and I've never had a problem with it. I keep all of my paraphernalia and goodies in a plastic Tupperware/Rubbermaid container, and put the whole container in the back of my closet. That way, it's away from light and extreme temperatures (which can ruin your weed), and, because of the Tupperware/Rubbermaid, there's no smell whatsoever, which means air isn't going in or out (another factor to ruining weed). My buddy recently just bought himself a comparable plastic container with latches on the lid, and it's just as airtight and portable.   As long as you keep your goodies away from heat, light, and the air, it should last a long time. I've had the same stuff in my grinder for at least a month before and nothing happened to it. Cold is okay for fresh or ground bud, and actually may prolong its lifespan if you aren't planning on using it for a long time."
saplings,35nc2e,Afrew,1 point,Mon May 11 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"Okay I was in a similar situation on this subreddit a month or two weeks ago not sure been smoking a lot. Here's my advice. Buy a 3 or four piece aluminum grinder that catches kief there's no need to spend $50 but check reviews. Now onto the debate of grinding vs not grinding your bud right away.  Grinding it all at once does have benefits and negatives but that's mostly related to how much you buy and how you store bud. My only argument against storing in bud form is that you lose a little kief to your jar but it can be scraped out. If you get 1/4 or more just grind enough for a sesh and throw extra in an Rx bottle and then put the bulk of your stash in a mason jar. If you get an 1/8 or less you're fine grinding it all right away and again throwing it in an Rx bottle. Also not grinding right away is fun you get to look at those beautiful nugs longer, you can show them to friends that swing by for a sesh, and it adds to the ritual to grind fresh bud for the nights bowl. Just my .02"
saplings,35nc2e,Carbongiaraffe,1 point,Tue May 12 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. Your weed is easier to spill, will become dried out faster, will lose potency, and depending on the build quality, your cheap grinder may give your shake some unwanted paint flakes.   Grinding buds destroys a lot of trichomes; in turn this reduces potency. You will gather some kief from grinding your buds, that's a given. But what you won't see if the glandular heads broken and all the good stuff is gone. Along with plant matter being able to easier mix with your kief because of you grinding it.   The only time I grind my bud is if I want to use my vaporizer, or if I want to smoke a J. You are losing potency by grinding, but if you are a noob smoker (you are, its OK! :D ) you probably wont care because it will hit you hard anyways."

In an illegal state there's no way to certify what your getting and most dealers don't even know besides whatever bull shit the supplier says. All the dealers in my area just determine if it's an indica or sativa, then give it the name of some random famous strain.   If i am buying consistently from the same dealer I might ask for a strain if I know it's gonna be the same shit every time but I doubt it's actually that strain. Personally I know someone in an illegal state is probably a sapling when they are obviously obsessed with a strain.

Blunt wraps are made from large tobacco leaves (generally), and as we know, tobaccy is bad...  Papers are usually rice paper which is not good for your lungs, but relative to cigarette smokers, is not a huge worry.  Ideally you would not smoke at all, as any sort of smoke inhalation is bad, but us Ents like our trees....so smoking from a pipe of some sort, or even better, a VAPORIZER, would be better for you.  The way that I have always thought about it is that cigarette smokers are inhaling tobacco and paper many times a day, and are developing cancer and other respiratory problems, but smoking trees is not nearly as bad for you, and hopefully you are not smoking as much weed as tobacco smokers are smoking tobacco.

Don't ever go driving while high, or ride with a driver who is high. Safety first, no matter what. There's a trillion and one places to get stoned, but a moving automobile is not one of them. Bring along a water bottle and keep it at hand. Once the cotton mouth hits you, it's a pain in the neck to go searching for water. Plus, nothing really nails the high home like a cool, refreshing gulp of water. Love it. Wear comfortable clothing that can easily be adapted to the temperature around you. It's no fun being too hot or too cold when stoned, and it's even worse when your clothes are bothering you. Smoke slowly. Take one or two hits, and then wait for at least 10 minutes before deciding if you want more. It's very easy for beginners to smoke too much. If you are smoking with someone who is experienced and you have questions, ask them those questions. When it was my very first time, I asked my buddy and his friend (who are both pretty experienced) how to inhale, how long to keep the flame on the bud, how long to hold a hit, what to expect, etc. Afterwards, they both told me that they were really glad I asked so many questions beforehand, because then I actually had an idea of what to do, rather than try to force it and possibly have a bad time. If you start to cough, everything is okay, and you will be fine. When I first started out, I coughed really hard, and always thought I was gonna pass out or something, but I always pulled through in flying colors. If you start to cough or find it difficult to breathe, just remember: Take a deep breath, and make a damn plan. Take slow, controlled breaths, and concentrate on the burning you feel in your chest. As you slowly will the pain away, remember that it's under your control and that you are fine."

saplings,35lo1l,imthatguydavid,1 point,Mon May 11 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"i agree with all except number 1 2. Sorry I just can't. You should change the wording to inebriated instead of high. Especially if the friend smokes daily.   Being high is different from being so high you are inebriated. If you are having trouble forming words, or walking normally, yes; you should not drive. But if Joe McStoner smokes 2 rips from a bong, but smokes weed every hour he is awake, it's not gonna hit him as hard as Sally NoBake who is taking her first puff.   Not every rule is black and white. Just like there is a Intoxication limit for alcohol, .07 I believe is the ""allowed"" BAC for a driver. I know that I've seen people drink 3 beers and are perfectly fine driving. But for me, I won't drink more than 1, because alcohol effects me quickly. Know your body, know your limits, dont be stupid."
saplings,35lo1l,DrQuaid,2,Mon May 11 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"Sally NoBake. That's a good one, I'm gonna use that!"
saplings,35lo1l,TheQueenBoo,1 point,Mon May 11 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not changing the wording at all. Why would you ever take the risk of driving under the influence of any drug, be it booze or bud, despite whether your body can ""handle it"" or not? That's stupid. Besides, it's not just about you, it's about every driver and pedestrian around you too.  Also, let's say you get pulled over for something while you're high, even if it doesn't have anything to do with your driving. You will be penalized very harshly for driving while under the influence, and cops can tell. If you get in an accident and they prove you were on drugs, you wouldn't have a chance in hell of winning that case.   Also, you are technically referring to Number 2, not Number 1."
saplings,35lo1l,Afrew,0,Mon May 11 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"Because not all drugs function the same. I'm not condoning driving when you're unable, but a no tolerance rhetoric for this is extremely harmful to the on going discussion, and indicates a lack of knowledge about how cannabis functions. Alcohol is a Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant. In any and all amounts, the metabolization of the drug slows down your body's ability to send messages through your nervous system to your brain and then to your muscles.   Marijuana is NOT NOT NOT a CNS depressant. It does not at all, in any way impact your motor skills. The only impact it has is on your conscious ability to control those. So yes, when you're absolutely blazed on the couch, unable to focus on much, giggling uncontrollably; you should not drive. There's no way you can focus on the information required to be a good driver and make good decisions. But otherwise, you're going to be fine. The drug doesn't slow down your body's motor skills, or sensory processing.   Being educated about the facts of this drug is extremely important. I'll agree no one should drive high until they have enough experience with the drug to know how it affects them, but that's true of every single substance, even non psychoactive prescription meds tell you to do that. But I drive on my seizure meds and my adderall all the time now."
saplings,35lo1l,Martient712,2,Tue May 12 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"Like I already said, it's an irresponsible and unnecessary risk that puts you and those around you in danger, so there's no reason to take the risk. If getting high is so important to someone that they are willing to put themselves in a piece of metal that weighs thousands of pounds that can travel over a hundred miles per hour and can destroy damn near anything in its path, then that person has some serious issues to work out.   Also, ""[marjiuana] does not at all, in any way impact your motor skills. The only impact it has is on your conscious ability to control those.""? That's totally splitting hairs. If it affects your conscious ability to control motor skills, then it is affecting your motor skills. Indirect influence is still influence.  I know plenty more than you think I do. I've extensively researched marijuana since I was in middle school. Marijuana is a drug, and treating it like anything different is irresponsible."
saplings,35lo1l,Afrew,1 point,Tue May 12 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"I also completely admitted it is a drug, but it's just important to know what kind of drug it is. And the fact that it doesn't impact your motor skills is extremely important to this distinction. Anyone with experience in marijuana use can drive up to a certain point of being high, and that's perfectly ok. As long as you aren't actively distracted by the cognitive effects of the drug, you're fine.  The same does not apply to alcohol. I can drink 6 beers and still feel pretty sober, not distracted by being drunk, but there's no way in hell I should drive even with less beers because alcohol has a physical mechanism for affecting your motor skills. Marijuana does not have that function. Driving while mildly high for an experienced smoker holds the same risk as driving with the radio on."
saplings,35lo1l,Martient712,-2,Tue May 12 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I've gotten pulled over high , going to mcdonalds to get munchies. I only got pulled over because my headlight was out. He let me go with a warning to be careful. Unless you are INEBRIATED they will never be able to tell. And unless you are talking about cough medicine, caffeine, anti-depressants, Pain relievers, allergy medication, or any ""drug"", then you can't say just don't smoke weed and drive.   And, they can't ""prove"" you are high, unless you are in an advanced state (CO, WA) where they have on-site saliva tests. And even then, there are cases being fought because that doesn't even detect inebriation, just active cannabinoids (which can last for some time after ingestion) in the blood.   And yes, sorry i was wrong in saying #1, it was #2.  And because I use weed for medication, I know what I can handle to be un-impaired.   If you can't look after yourself enough to limit your intake to what you can handle, I agree. Don't take the risk. But if it's something you have to use or choose to use everyday due to whatever reason, you should know how inebriated you are from marijuana. It doesn't destroy all sense of reason like alcohol, it doesn't make you pass out at the wheel like Opiates or Alprazolam. You won't trip out and see fucking monsters coming out of the ground, and you wont think you are playing bumber cars.   Once again, I agree that not everyone should smoke and drive. Not even a lot of people. But when you use it like a medicine, and it is your medicine, you will probably have to drive while using it, unless you are wealthy/lucky enough to have the money for being transported by other people.   It is not black and white, quit trying to think it is."
saplings,35lo1l,DrQuaid,0,Tue May 12 01:46:35 2015 UTC,"Responsibility is pretty black and white though, and smoking before operating a vehicle is irresponsible, period. And using the petty ""oh well if you say this drug is bad then you have to say these are bad too"" is kind of childish, honestly. I never said that every other drug was okay to drive on, I only specified marijuana.  Marijuana isn't some cure-all miracle drug, and I really wish people would stop treating it as such. If you make the conscious decision to get behind the wheel after smoking marijuana, you are irresponsible. If you need it as ""medication"", then why not take it after you are done driving, or take it hours before you start driving?  I seriously can't believe that a safety behavior like this is getting challenged. It's honestly ridiculous."

Inhale the smoke from your pipe/joint/blunt so you're holding it in your mouth. Pull the pipe/joint/blunt away from your mouth (stop inhaling smoke) and then, with the smoke still in your mouth, take another deep breath of fresh air through your nose/mouth. its important that you don't exhale until after this step   This get the smoke actually in your lungs. It also helps to exhale through your nose or a combination of nose/mouth. Helps the smoke fully circulate your system.  This technique isn't used with a bong though, when you pull the slide/bowl out and you take that deep breath to clear the cylinder, that shoots the smoke right in to your lungs."

saplings,35lo1l,amitball,3,Tue May 12 00:12:01 2015 UTC,If your using a bowl or a bong ask if they can pack just a pinch or two for you. Even better would be if they have a onie. Onies are always good for first timers since you take one average size hit guaranteed no more. Wait at least 5-10 minutes between your first few hits. Also more knowledgeable ents correct me if I'm wrong but a high is strongest 30 minutes in and then starts to fade away. For most purposes a high lasts only a few hours 1-3 for people who've smoked a few times but be careful as  your first time it could linger when I started smoking regularly I would smoke a joint(alone) at 7am and fully sober up around 2pm. Cottonmouth is terrible Arizona drinks are great for it. Fast food is divine stoned. Don't take to big of a hit right away you could puke or cough into the piece. If you do puke just lay down drink water and relax. Make sure your friend knows it's your first time and make sure they plan to ease you into it. If for any reason dabs are offered stay away dabbing to early is not fun my first dab was my first time with a real piece I cleared the whole thing started vomiting and blacking out.

Most of my advice has already been posted; slow drags, be careful to not combust, etc.   But also:   Holding your drag in for 5-10 seconds helps get really good hits and minimizes the amount of vapor you breath out, which in turn makes it nearly odorless.   Cleaning the stem is as easy as a pair of pliers and a faucet that can get really hot.   Don't take hits over and over again. It's easy to get head trapped or ""too high"" if you do. Take a few hits then wait a little while to see how you feel.   When your heating up, you can look down the glass stem to see how much smoke there is. This also helps you tell when the battery is getting low because the light gets dimmer as the battery drains."

We called it ""The Device"" and it filtered out damn near every molecule of scent we blew through it."
saplings,35livg,GnashRoxtar,2,Tue May 12 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"So, really what you are asking is how do filters in general work, since that's all a sploof is. Smells are caused by particulates in the air, which are detectable to human olfactory glands. These particulates are very, very small, much smaller than the holes in tissue paper or dryer sheets. However, if any particulate directly hits a strand of thread in the sheet, it will embed itself instead of going into the air. By layering these sheets, not only does this increase the chance it will hit a strand by adding more strands, but trips the flow into becoming turbulent (swirl randomly) and makes it much more likely that the particulates will impact a strand.  Dryer sheets are common because of how fine the pores are, and they are generally scented which also helps mask the smell. Wet towels are also fairly effective since the water droplets in the fibers can also absorb the particulates. Another post on here talks about activated carbon, the advantage there is just that activated carbon is a pretty good filter for the same reasons as above since it has very small pores, there isn't anything chemical going on if I remember correctly.  There are some filters which chemically react to the fluid, but these are usually for things like hydraulic systems and catalytic converters (which aren't technically filters), not for normal air filters."

saplings,35kkhl,MyNameIsKiko,1 point,Tue May 12 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"I primarily use my pipe when I smoke, but after buying a really tiny glass bong not too long ago, I tend to use that more often when I'm by myself, and the pipe when I'm with a friend or 2. I tend to buy really potent stuff, and I only smoke about once per week so my tolerance is low enough as it is, so the tiny bowl for the bong is better than smoking a huge-ass bowl all by myself. I've noticed that hits are a bit less harsh with my tiny bong, but the difference is practically negligible when compared to my pipe. All in all though, I prefer my pipe. It feels better in my hand, it's easier to light, and I get better airflow control.  I bought a disposable vape pen filled with hash oil from my dealer once, and the discretion factor it had was amazing since I could get high next to someone and they couldn't tell, plus I only needed 2 or 3 puffs to get pretty respectably stoned, but it only lasted about 50 hits instead of the promised 120 before it went bad. It was worth it for the time I suppose, but it should have lasted longer for it to be a good deal.  I've used a desktop vaporizer before (the Easy Vape with glass whip) with a couple dudes and it was pretty excellent. It didn't smell at all, the weed lasted a long time, and only 2 hits put me stoned off my ass, but it was really harsh (I coughed really hard for at least a few minutes straight and couldn't get my wind back), but that may have been from the size of the hit I took, iunno. With that said, I've spent a lot of time looking into getting a Magic Flight Launch Box for personal vaporizing use (pretty cheap, portable, efficient, easy to use, excellent warranty), but am still apprehensive because I don't like getting ""too high"".  I've tried joints a couple times and they didn't work well. I rolled them personally with a little machine and they were okay I suppose, but for some reason the highs I got with them were not very enjoyable. The first time I ever had a joint was when it was rolled absolutely perfectly by an old stoner with decent weed, but, still, the high was really intense and borderline non-enjoyable. I've rolled one by hand recently (the first time I've ever done it by hand) with what was left in my grinder, and it looks pretty good, so I'm planning on splitting it with a couple friends.  Edibles are really nice if you only have them every once in a while, at least in my view. I made Old Hippie's Firecrackers once and split half of it with a good buddy of mine. After about 45 minutes it started to kick in and then we were amazingly stoned for about 3 hours straight before starting to come down. We watched videos about black holes and it was freaky, lol. I made a Firecracker again for 4/20 and ate half of it myself, and it was pretty excellent; I just listened to music and absorbed myself into a personal Universe. I had the remainder a couple weeks later and it was okay, but something about it was a bit off, but I don't know how. Anywho, edibles are great every once in a while, but not all the time."

saplings,35kj4q,Ankkassa,5,Mon May 11 06:16:41 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a toker of 7 years now, with just about daily use for the last 2. I'll answer your questions in order as well as I can.   The amount you need to keep you in the green for 3 weeks depends on a few things, chiefly method of administration, your current tolerance, and how often you wanna get baked. Assuming you're using a piece, smoking one bowl of about .3-.5g each session and doing that, say, 2-3 times a week, you're probably gonna want an eighth, maybe a bit more. If you have a friend who also likes to toke, I'd suggest maybe trying to split a quarter ounce with them. This may seem like a lot of money (between $80-100 for 7 grams on the east coast), but this way the math works out to just over $10 a gram which is much better than street price. Like you said, economy of scale. For efficiency's sake I would suggest a piece over rolling papers. If you don't want to drop money on glass you'll only be using for a little while, there are plenty of ways to improvise a piece. If you go the DIY route, I'd suggest you make a gravity bong (should be a link in the sidebar, if not just search). Gravity bongs are one of the most efficient ways to smoke, plus with proper technique have reduced smell-- but be careful, those things can get you high as balls on a giraffe on top of Mount Everest! Some recommendations for being home alone high: Listen to music, loud, on the best speakers in the house. Make ridiculous munchie food in your kitchen. If you're creatively inclined, making art is great, even if it's just strumming a few chords on the guitar or doodling/coloring/fingerpainting. If you've got pets, play with them while stoned-- giving a shaggy dog some puppy lovin' or petting a fluffy feline friend when you're baked is one of the purest joys life on this rock has to offer. Oh, and take a shower during the come-up; trust me, the feeling of hot water on your body and the smell of your favorite shampoo, which are already good things, are downright blissful on your way to a [5] and above. Plus you won't have to worry about smell! Shot glass and scissors, definitely. No need to spend money on paraphernalia you won't even be using a month from now. Coffee or tea are nice if you want a hot beverage, make sure you have water too though to avoid super dry mouth from THC + caffeine. Can't go wrong with orange juice either-- ""Kush and OJ"" is definitely a thing for a reason. If you're feeling crazy, add some fruit, low fat yogurt, a frozen banana or two and make a smoothie! My day is going great, thanks for asking! The fam had a successful Mother's Day, we took her out to lunch and then came home and all watched a movie together. Some rom-com called ""Today's Special"" about an Indian chef in NYC, it was cute.  Let's tally the expenses: For bud itself, between $40-55 depending on the deal you can get. You can probably find a piece for $10-25, though again if you make a grav bong your costs for this are essentially the price of a gatorade bottle and your time. For extras, let's budget $20 for food delivery at some point, plus $5 for a lighter and gum. So, if you splurge, around $100 for three weeks of fun. Not bad!   It sounds like you have a really solid couple weeks up ahead, frient. I hope I've been able to provide you with some useful info. If you have any questions or need me to clarify anything please ask!   tl;dr 1.Get an eighth or split a quarter with a friend, 2.make a gravity bong, 3.listen to music/be creative/take a shower, 4.don't worry about a grinder, 5.hydrate yoself, 6.my day was good, 7.you'll spend about a hundred bucks but probably less.

saplings,35kj4q,AustinA55,2,Mon May 11 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"1.) Depending on how often you plan on smoking, half an ounce is probably good. Otherwise, aim for a 1/4.   2.) Pieces are cheap. You don't need to spend more than 10 dollars on a piece if it's a temporary setup. Some thick pipes come in less than 10, and a bubbler will probably be more around 15 dollars. I suggest a pipe, preferably glass because glass smells a lot less if you're concerned about smell, but bubblers give you more for your money.  Maybe buy a piece and a pack of papers for a special treat when you can go outside.   3.) Grinders aren't necessary unless you really like to have a perfect bowl of bud or a joint. You can use scissors and a shot glass or just your fingers. I personally prefer picking my grass apart with my fingers, but to each their own. Grinders are cheap, so you can buy one for the hell of it anyways (I have a trusty, cheap grinder myself for if I'm ever in the mood)."

I have a feeling you don't smoke often/ever so buy a quarter of weed(not too much not too little). Once high you will figure out what to do. As far as the intake of the smoke goes, find a empty water bottle and a small socket for a socket wrench. Burn a dime sized hole in the bottom of the bottle. you will use this hole for pulling the smoke. heat up the top of the bottle enough so you can force the socket in(make sure it's tight). pack the socket with weed. Its cheap, gets you stoned, and if the bottle gets dirty just swap it for another. Enjoy."

These should help you identify a batch, but remember that there are always exceptions and you can never know the full effects of a particular strain until you consume it.  Sativa: usually long, skinny buds; less dense; lighter green in color with brighter orange hairs; if it is growing, you will usually have a tall plant reminiscent of a tree rather than a bush. Scents vary widely, but many have a fruity or diesel-like smell.  Indica: usually fatter, short, dense buds; darker green in color with many strains having purple tones; will grow more like a wide, short bush. The smell is usually considered ""earthy"" or pungent.  Also, keep in mind that most strains now are hybrids and will have characteristics of both. Sometimes a hybrid will have dominant phenotypes that can help you better determine its effects. However, what would probably help you personally is to keep a journal of each strain you get. Every time you pick up a batch note the color, size, texture, smell, etc. Then after you smoke write down the effects you felt from that particular strain. Were you uplifted and energetic (sativa), or relaxed and sleepy (Indica)? Did you feel time was going by really slowly (Sativa) or flew by quickly (Indica)? You can note anything that you think would help you identify the strain another time or help you compare the strain to a different one. Over time and with enough exposure and experience you should be able to know what to expect from a certain strain you get."

saplings,35hk46,Super__Squirrel,6,Sun May 10 13:02:08 2015 UTC,"I nearly always use a pipe. Here's a step-by-step for me:   I like to grind my bud really fine, practically powder, before I start to pack. Grinding it finely provides more even ember-spreading, and tends to have a decreased chance of staying lit after your hit. If you are going to grind it really fine, I highly recommend getting a pipe screen out of a material that is safe to smoke from. I've used the ones in my link, and they are a life saver. You don't inhale tiny bits, it's easier to pack, and cleanup is significantly easier. You sacrifice a tiny bit of bowl space, but it's more than worth it. I start packing the bowl by picking up a pinch of ground bud, and dropping it in the bowl. I just let it fall in. After a couple pinches, I'll tamp it down lightly with my fingertip. Repeat this process until it is as full as you want it to be. If your bud is ground fine, this will make a dense bowl. When packed in my way, my pipe will easily give 24 or 25 hits. I like to have nice, dense bowls because the air resistance allows me to more easily control the size of the hits I take, and because, lots of times, I won't finish the bowl, so I can just put it away until I smoke again, and it removes a lot of the process of packing a new bowl each time. Lighting it is incredibly easy to learn and master, but first-timers may have difficulty. Put the pipe in your mouth, engage the lighter, and sloooowly move the flame towards the bowl. Try as hard as you can to not touch the flame to the bud. Instead, get the flame very close so the radiant heat lights it. This helps conserve the bud in the bowl and heats it more efficiently and evenly. This is commonly called ""cornering"". To do the opposite is to ""scorch"", which is when you simply douse the bowl in flame, which makes it overly harsh and burns up the bud too quickly.  While smoking, hold your thumb or finger (depending on the size and shape of the pipe) on the ""carb"" (carburetor [otherwise known as a ""choke"" or ""shotgun""]) to reduce the airflow. This will allow you to get more smoke from the existing embers without burning more than necessary. Just before you are done with your hit, release the carb and lightly inhale the remainder of smoke out of the pipe. Be careful with this, because inhaling too sharply can relight the weed and you either have to take a much bigger hit than you were expecting, or just let it burn and waste that bit of weed. Since you don't have a carb on your pipe, just inhale slowly and carefully and you'll be fine.  For beginners, it's a good idea to inhale the smoke and hold it in your mouth, and then inhale through your mouth into your lungs. This way reduces the harshness a bit and prevents you from depriving yourself of too much oxygen. In one fluid action I like to take a hit, breathe into my lungs until they are full, and then slowly exhale. Just one solid ""fwwwwiiiiiiiffffffffhahhhhhhh"". You can choose to hold the hit in for a few seconds if you'd like. Any longer than 5 seconds is unnecessary, and just makes it a bit harsher.  Take a few deep breaths and chill for a bit in between each hit. Taking a hit every time you take a breath is a good way to pass out since you are depriving yourself of enough oxygen. Plus, by chilling for a second and taking it slow, you really get to feel it kick in, which is enjoyable. Depending on the size of your bowl (and also a little on how much you tamp it), you will get varying amounts of hits until it's ""spent"". If you suspect that there is still some fresh green under the ash on top, I would suggest taking a toothpick and lightly ""fluffing"" the bowl, and then hitting it with the flame itself. A bowl will be completely spent if the ashes are all white or grey, and have the appearance of being flattened and crumpled inward.   If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Smoking from a pipe is easy to learn and very relaxing, since you can just take a couple hits and then leave the rest for later, something you can't do easily with a joint."

saplings,35hk46,interested_george,3,Sun May 10 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"First  of all, you can roll a joint with no tobacco in it, that's just personal choice. Also your tree doesn't need to be too fine, but you don't just want to drop a nug in the bowl. There is no need for it to stay lit, you can always relight it, smoke at your own pace. And when it's black it's almost done, you can hit it if you want, but again it's all up to you."
saplings,35hk46,interested_george,1 point,Sun May 10 13:57:52 2015 UTC,I thought so just never seen anyone do it so assumed there was a reason not to.   Also inhale and suck at the same time or suck into mouth then inhale?
saplings,35hk46,RuneTheWolf,1 point,Sun May 10 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"I prefer to draw into my mouth then inhale, as it gives the smoke an opportunity to cool before you inhale so you won't cough as much.

And depending how big your bowl is, usually determines how many hits you'll take. Larger bowl.. more hits anyway! Try not to let it stay lit n cherry, You'll waste some bud whilst doing that, Im sure you'll notice that when it does that smoke just kinda floats away.   And for the most part yes if it's all ash and black more than likely it's done. I'll usually take a pen, knife ect and move the ash around. Sometimes there's a little bud that just didn't get lit because the ash was covering it.  Hope this helps"

saplings,35h5xw,hbostann,4,Sun May 10 08:53:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, most first timers inhale inadequately, so this is pretty normal. You probably ""sucked in"" but didn't actually inhale the smoke. Next time, ""suck in"" smoke, and then take a deep breath of fresh air with the smoke still in your mouth and hold it for a second (I literally mean a second or two, no longer) before releasing. It should feel like it's in your chest, not your throat or mouth.   I think a lot of saplings think that there's some special technique to smoking, but there really isn't. It's like breathing- you literally just pull the smoke into your mouth and take a breathe in and then out. Really simple. Don't over-complicate things because the feeling of having smoke in your mouth is new. Just pretend you're taking deep breaths."
saplings,35h5xw,TokerDokers,1 point,Sun May 10 09:09:41 2015 UTC,"I have the same advice pretty much. Just relax, lightly pull smoke in your mouth,  breathe in and out like a regular breath, don't try to hold anything in the first time."
saplings,35h5xw,fresh_squeeze,1 point,Sun May 10 11:22:21 2015 UTC,"With a joint usually the best way is to suck the smoke into your mouth, then take the joint away and breathe that smoke in. If you're smoking out of anything with a bowl, just start inhaling and at any point just fill your lungs the rest of the way with air. Also hold the smoke in your lungs for a few seconds, holding for longer than 5 seconds is pointless. The smoke is a bit irritating until you get used to it. Basically if the smoke gets into your lungs, you should start to feel something after a few minutes and it will fully kick in about 10 minuets after your last hit. Don't underestimate it and smoke too much. The effects you will probably notice are heavy eyelids, possibly sharper vision, you'll start to think differently, and the body high which can feel weird at first but when you're used to it, it feels more relaxing. Don't expect to feel dizzy, maybe a bit uncoordinated or off balance but not like alcohol."

saplings,35feep,Dr_Romm,3,Sat May 9 20:57:48 2015 UTC,If you are brand new to cannabis I recommend not eating the entire thing. Start off with cutting it in fourths and try it slowly. I've never had one but everyone I've heard from says they are really strong little suckers.
saplings,35feep,DatBowl,6,Sat May 9 22:32:51 2015 UTC,"Some are 70mg, 100mg, or 175 mg of THC. They make some high CBD ones as well.   It would be helpful to know what OP has, because you're right - even the 70mg one would be too much for me from an edible when my tolerance is down.   OP, you should probably start off with no more than 20mg THC and wait 60-90 minutes or so to see how you feel. That means cutting it up into portions depending on what dosage you have."

I stood up and tried to climb the hill and I lost my vision for 5 minutes. I had to latch onto my friend for a few minutes to gain my vision back, and I was almost blacking out the entire way back up.   That wasn't the first time I started ""losing consciousness"", either.   It's more common than people think. It might be the physical reaction of your heart BPM dropping super low and then, when you suddenly get up and start moving, it rises pretty quickly. Not to mention your blood vessels are contracted from inhaling smoke. Ever get in the shower after smoking a cigarette and feel super lightheaded? The same thing, only you're inhaling waaay more smoke with a bong.   Be careful when smoking, especially from bongs. Keep a water bottle besides you and drink plenty of water between hits. I always find food seems to stabilize me as well; it might have to do with your blood sugar, but I'm no expert. It's really not good to smoke on an empty stomach."

My advice is to get something like the lighter natural american spirit tobacco or javaanse jongens or something, they don't even taste too bad."

Most people I know toast their joints either to dry off the saliva used to seal the rolling paper or because they think it creates a lighter/better smoke. I can't tell a difference between a toasted or non-toasted j.  If you smoke tobacco on any regular basis it's nearly impossible not to become addicted to it.

I use a little lego shovel to measure out dosages for people who are new to smoking or have a low tolerance. Always tend to give half a shovel worth just to see how they react to the strength of the strain and then increase or decrease for the following hits. Imo this is the best way to do it until you've gotten a bit of a tolerance or you know how to hit a piece with a fully packed bowl better.

Sharpstone is a very well known and well respected brand for grinders.  The top 2 pieces do the actual grinding. The third piece is a screen that's holds ground weed and allows kief to fall through. The fourth piece is your kief catcher.  The bottom 3 screw together and the top 2 are held together by magnets to allow free spinning capability.  To grind weed, take the top piece off your grinder. Grab a nug of weed. Pull off bits of it and set them in between the teeth of the 2nd piece. Put the top piece back on and twist a lot. Unscrew the top half from the bottom half (do this over a magazine or something in case any falls out) and take a deep whiff of that good good. Proceed to smoke, vape, or otherwise consume.  Tip: Hold your grinder upside down while grinding if you want a finer grind. Also, you may want a scraper for your kief catcher piece. Some grinders come with this.  Trick: If you like kief, toss a dime or a penny into your grinder (right on top of the screen). After closing it shut, shake the shit out of your grinder. It gives a finer grind and shakes more kief loose."

I personally prefer smaller holes for joints and bigger ones for bongs since I don't use screens to hold the weed but instead hope for structural integrity of the weed interlocking.  Also try to not put weed in the middle of the grinder where the stem with the magnet is since that part only rotates and doesn't grind weed but instead presses it"

Like if I get high when important things need doing like work commitments, homework, spending time with family, etc then my high is usually pretty shitty because instead of enjoying it and letting things happen naturally I feel it must force it.   However when I get high after I finish work and my commitments it's fucking awesome. The feeling of having nothing to but just be high and enjoy it is truly the best feeling in the world and so my highs are super good.

I'm lucky enough to live in a medicinal state and now can go into a store and know what strain to buy, but there were a few rough times while learning what I liked and didn't like.

saplings,35curl,begrudged,1 point,Sat May 9 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"A local shop is best for just a pipe/grinder I think because you can see it/hold it and support local business and check out other cool stuff, but for anything more expensive, online can be cool and cheaper if you can trust the vendor. I vape, and I got a great EZ Vape for like $35 from Amazon (but it seems Amazon no longer sells vaping equipment and I have trust issues with eBay).  This assumes you are in a legal or medicinal state. I wouldn't want weed paraphernalia sent to me in, for example, Texas; of course there you want to drive careful on your way home from the head shop.  To add to my previous answer, I used to get a good ""body buzz"" when I got high and it sometimes came with a muffled ringing in my ears that sounded like I was at the beach. I no longer get that, and it could be due to years of use or it could be that my use now is medicinal rather than recreational, and so I rarely vape sativas.

If you felt that the discomfort you experienced wasn't worth it, then don't toke, smoking isn't for everyone.

saplings,35b3gh,R2gro2,5,Fri May 8 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it only takes a few seconds to absorb all the thc, no need re-inhale smoke that's already been in your lungs"
saplings,35b3gh,macho_tacoman,2,Fri May 8 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"Not really, or else shotgunning and hotboxing wouldn't be a thing. When you inhale, after a second or two, your lungs have absorbed all the THC they will from that breath. So holding it in for more than a few seconds doesn't get you any higher (except via oxygen deprivation). When you exhale though, the smoke still contains quantities of unabsorbed THC. So exhaling partially allows you to recapture some of that unabsorbed THC in the next breath of the same smoke.  There are obviously diminishing returns, and you know, new oxygen is kind of important, but there is nothing but an upside to rebreathing once or twice."
saplings,35b3gh,R2gro2,1 point,Sat May 9 01:23:50 2015 UTC,Where is your source on this? Why would the lungs simply stop absorbing THC but then continue absorbing from the same smoke after you breath it in again?
saplings,35b3gh,Baked_Bacon_420,2,Sat May 9 10:44:51 2015 UTC,"It's all about the function of the alveoli in the lungs. They're the small balloon-like structures that allow Oxygen and other gasses to cross from your lungs into your bloodstream. (The THC in your smoke hitches a ride here and follows the same path as the Oxygen does.) When you inhale,  the alveoli fill up, and start the gas exchange of O2 and CO2 but they remain full until you exhale. A large volume of the air you've inhaled therefore doesn't make it into the alveoli, and occupies space in the brachioles and other nooks and crannies in the lungs. You're not getting anything from that air, and so it remains full of Oxygen (and THC in our case).   When you exhale, you are emptying the alveoli of their contents, but also expelling a lot of that air that is still rich in Oxygen. This is one of the reasons why CPR works, among other things.  The goal of the partial exhale, is to expell the CO2, mix it with the air that didn't make it into the alveoli,  and when you reinhale fill the alveoli with a mix of Oxygen, CO2, and THC laden smoke that otherwise would have been wasted.  Biologically it should work,  anecdotally it does work, but I'm not aware of any study directly proving it."
saplings,35b3gh,EqualWin,1 point,Sat May 9 14:04:12 2015 UTC,"But when you exhale, the smoke that leaves your mouth would be the smoke that didn't reach the alveoli in the first place, so you would be reinhaling the smoke with diminished THC content"
saplings,35b3gh,Metalhead4026,1 point,Sun May 10 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well yes, diminished, but not completely absent of THC. That air released by the alveoli should also mix with the unused air before being reinhaled. Either way, you'll be getting more use out of smoke that you'd otherwise be wasting. It's not perfect, and it's kind of annoying, but since the point of the thread is how to get the most use out of a limited supply, every little bit helps."
saplings,35ahpf,N07070,6,Fri May 8 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"Joints are cheap and portable,  pipes are fairly portable and very convenient compared to rolling a million joints,  bongs will get you higher,  vapes are healthier for your lungs, and so on.  There are a lot of different pros+cons, but it's all a matter of personal preference.   Personally I would start with joints or a cheap/homemade pipe until you decide whether toking is something you want to invest in or not.  If you don't get high it's a 99% chance you weren't inhaling properly, by the way, very common mistake among smoking newbies"
saplings,35ahpf,SyadEgnarts,2,Fri May 8 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Bongs only get you higher because you are inhaling more smoke at a time. The actual difference in levels of THC between a joint, pipe, and bong are negligible."

To overcome that, first pull a drag into your mouth, then open your mouth a little bit and continue breathing in. Fill up your lungs. It's not the exact same technique most smokers use, but it's easier to manage as a new toker.  Coughing is normal. Nobody coughs from just pulling smoke into their mouths. If you ain't chokin', you ain't tokin'.  Take it slow. Don't feel like you have to hit it every breath. I made that mistake once... ONCE."

saplings,35ahpf,Afrew,3,Sat May 9 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"Smoking is all preference so it just depends on how you prefer to smoke. Since it's your first time you obviously don't know what feels like what, but I would start with a bowl or a joint. Honestly it doesn't really matter as long as you get high. My friend's first time was a grav bong so he was fucked up. But whatever sounds the most appealing to you is what you should start with. Weed isn't physically addictive, and the amount of weed you would need to smoke to do any serious damage to your lungs would be astronomical. So you'll be fine on that front. But if you do have an addictive personality you can get addicted to anything, mentally not physically. You'll be fine though man, just make sure you're with good people you trust and don't give in to anxiety. Weed is a great drug with little to no negative side effects. Just take it easy and welcome to the club."
saplings,35ahpf,Afrew,3,Fri May 8 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Weed can become physically addictive, similarly to how nicotine is. When you get high, it's because the cannabinoids are mimicking certain neurotransmitters (brain chemicals[neurotransmitters control everything within your body, from mood to hunger, to fear]) in your brain, specifically ""dopamine"", which controls happiness and general ""feel good"" feelings. If you get high too often, your brain starts producing less dopamine on its own because there's always the weed to supply the pseudo-dopamine for it. To balance this out, you keep smoking pot to keep your dopamine levels ""normal"".    I do agree about the lungs part, though. People are always talking about how ""an ounce of weed has as many carcinogens and tar as a whole pack of cigarettes"", but no one who casually wants to smoke once in a while is going to smoke an entire ounce in one sitting. It still damages the lungs, sure, smoking literally anything does, but it's not nearly as bad as a lot of other things out there."

saplings,35ahpf,foxy1167,5,Fri May 8 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"To preface everything I am about to say, keep in mind that marijuana and smoking affects everyone differently. While there may be common trends among smokers, there are some smokers who will not fit into a trend.  Anywho, for your first time, smoke with a friend who you trust completely. Wear your comfiest clothes and avoid wearing jewelry, just to be on the safe side. I prefer smoking from a pipe because it affords the most control over how much you smoke; if you smoke a joint, the joint stays lit until it all burns away or until you smoke it all, whereas with a pipe you can just stop and save the rest for later. A pipe is also nearly always easier to hold than a joint, and you don't have to worry about burning your lips. Don't go driving or riding in a car while you smoke. This is dangerous and risky. There's a trillion and one places where you can smoke and not be caught, but don't make an automobile one of them.  Marijuana addiction is not likely, but certainly possible. I smoke once per week (usually with a good buddy of mine), and can easily stop if I needed to. One of my friends smokes multiple times per day, and is completely lost; he hardly involves himself in real life anymore. A different friend told me how he used to smoke multiple times per day and hated it, but couldn't stop because it's what allowed him to function throughout the day (he has stopped cold turkey and is getting his health back, thankfully). Frequency (that is, how many times per day you smoke) is more important than potency/quality of the weed or how much you smoke in one session. As long as you limit yourself to (ideally) only a few times per month, you should be fine. Just keep a good grip on yourself.  Physical health effects are largely speculative, but mental health effects are entirely possible if smoking at a younger age. Your brain (specifically the frontal lobe) develops rapidly in your teenage years, and finally finishes developing when you are 24 years old. Smoking marijuana during the teenage years has the potentiality of stunting the development of your frontal lobe, and the more often you smoke the higher the risk of this will be. If your frontal lobe is stunted, you will have a harder time remembering things, learning will be more difficult, and you won't have the capacity to learn as much anymore. If you are in your teenage years, I strongly urge you to seriously consider not smoking marijuana until you are at least 20 years old. You only have one brain, why run the risk of ruining it?  To inhale as a beginner, I would always take a small hit into my mouth, stop taking a hit, and then inhale through my mouth until my lungs were full, and then slowly breathe out. This is the easiest way to get used to smoking, at least for me. Coughing is going to happen when you first start, and while it may make you feel like you are gonna die, you won't. If you start coughing really badly, just compose yourself and breathe slowly. ""Take a deep breath, and make a damn plan"" is a motto I learned on here a long time ago, and it's gotten me through quite a bit when I've been high."
saplings,359fac,MrMeridew,2,Fri May 8 05:21:55 2015 UTC,"When the smoke from a dab cools it reverts to its natural state of oil so if you have a reclaim you can capture that back and use it again. That's why oil rigs are so small so it allows the smoke to run through quickly so it doesn't change state. And a nectar collector is basically a ""pen"" with a mouth piece on one side and a nail on the other. You heat up the nail part and touch it to your concentrate and you suck the smoke through.

I've been a constant smoker since i was 14, and i am currently 17. I have pretty bad memory recollection at this point, and my ability to focus (already affected by my ADHD) has been hindered a noticeable amount. Now, i will say that it isn't a drastic change, but it is most certainly noticeable. If you're under 18, and considering cannabis, PLEASE weight the pro's and con's BEFORE affecting your brain."

I'm actually quite surprised they didn't do a drug panel to get into your program, but I know for certain that you will be drug tested at any facility you work at and it will be a urine test. Stay clean, healthcare jobs are very strict about drug use (even medical cannabis, which is unfortunately why I'm currently not working as an LVN/LPN)"
saplings,356puj,NFitz,3,Thu May 7 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't read the full post!!! I'm pretty baffled about the fact that you never got tested prior to employment, as far as the independent contractor thing, I'm not sure if it holds weight on the healthcare world... i could be wrong, depending on your state regulations regarding CNAs, but if you were found to be using drugs (even if you have medical card) while giving direct patient care, you might lose your license, even if you are contracted independently. I mean, people will flip shit if they find out a medical professional is smoking pot (even though we both know that it can be an amazing and safe medication)  From my understanding, they could report you to the nursing board, open and investigation while you are suspended, and your license would be terminated and then any job on healthcare would be closed to you. It's super shitty, i know, but again, I can't say for certain. Perhaps contact the nursing board anonymously (is that possible? Like an email maybe?) And see what they say?"
saplings,356puj,NFitz,4,Thu May 7 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, i called up a friend of mine who is currently working as a CNA.  She told me the independent contractor thing isn't valid since you are working under a license. You are licensed as long as you comply with the Nursing Board that gave you that license. A violation of your license, such as drug use would be enough to get your license taken away, should it ever be found out!  Apparently, you fell through the cracks of the system! My CNA friend couldn't believe you were able to get a job without drug testing lol  I know state regulations of CNAs varies, but I'm very certain that IF you were to fail a drug test, your license would be in serious jeopardy."
saplings,356puj,NFitz,3,Thu May 7 18:34:00 2015 UTC,In Canada if you drug tested your staff you damn well better half the people to replace the half you are going to end up firing.  EMS in particular.

If they were going to drug test you for employment, they would have done it already. I really don't think that they would look at your file, realize that you've never taken a drug test, and then drug test you. They will probably never even realize, and if they do, still not give you one because you've already been working there for a while. Maybe look up the company online or see the company policy on drug tests, but unless you get randomly drug tested, you should be fine. You might want to continue your T-break until you are no longer psychologically addicted, though."

saplings,356puj,arbivark,2,Thu May 7 18:16:59 2015 UTC,Look up your state laws. In mine they have to tell you upfront if there is drug testing and have a clear post in your place of work.
saplings,356puj,DMagnific,2,Thu May 7 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, Nfitz, that was very thoughtful and considerate of you to call a friend to get some advice for me! I figured me not being drug tested was the exception, and not the standard, so thank you for confirming that for me before I did something stupid. I was about ready to call my old guy and ask him the cool names of what he has in stock. I'd be lying if I said I'm totally giving up on it at this point, but I definitely am gonna stick it out longer at least until I can get a clearer idea of why I wasn't tested. It's definitely not worth risking right now as they give me tons of hours, I enjoy the clients I see, and they started me out making more than my girlfriend does, who's been a CNA for 2 years now; and that was after pulling a no-call no-show at my last job (wasn't in the medical field, it was at a pizza joint where I was being treated like shit after I put in my resignation, but still doesn't look the best) and being unemployed for awhile. So after what you've told me, it wouldn't be smart for me to risk this while having so little to fall back on.   I'd really like to be a travel nurse. I'm sure it's awesome to see different parts of the country, I hear the housing allowance is great, and I've heard that several of them get paid well enough to be able to take 2-4 month vacations every year. It'd be really cool to work 8 months, schedule my last contract in a city I'd enjoy vacationing in, smoke all the weed I could for 3 months, use the last one to clean up, and get back to helping people for another 8 months.  I thank everyone for being kind enough to offer whatever advice they had. Stoners in the medical community aren't generally well-received, so it's refreshing to see people willing to relate to and assist someone in the position I'm in. NFitz, it was especially kind of you to give your friend a call to gain more clarity about the situation I'm dealing with."

It'd matter because while two or three hits from a joint could be feasible to flush from your system in just a week, taking massive dabs or hitting wax would be different. You'd be looking at 2-3 weeks, much like a daily user who quits would be.  So since you have two months it's all really irrelevant, I was just pointing it out."

saplings,356mjh,D1STURBED36,1 point,Thu May 7 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"A urine test can detect THC in your system at around one month after use. Obviously this depends on your weight, excercise and other factors. I believe there is information on /r/trees on this (sidebar?).  The mouth swab will only get THC in your mouth within the past 32-24 hours.  If you don't smoke for 2 days prior to a mouth swab test you'll be okay.  I've heard that pectin can rid the THC from your urine for half an hour, but I'm not totally sure about this. You'd want to research and possibly self test it before you try it for your real test.  Good luck!"
saplings,358amt,even_death_may_die,3,Thu May 7 23:00:36 2015 UTC,"No, it will not get you high. In order for edibles to get you high, you have to bond the THC with fat. That is why you can't just eat weed. When you eat a weed brownie, the THC has bonded with the fat in the butter, and that is how it gets in your bloodstream. In this case, the THC is not bonded to fat, so it simply gets phased through your liver and passes right into your piss."
saplings,358amt,TheDweadPiwatWobbas,2,Fri May 8 09:29:44 2015 UTC,"All wrong answers so far.. here's the right answer..   No, you won't get high. There are lots of cannibinoids with marijuana, right. THC, the stuff that gets you high, is actually not one of them... not yet, anyway. The substances come in the form of THCA or THC acid. When looking at the chemical composition, the acid is what's called a carboxyl group. This carboxyl group prevents the THC from being used by the human body. You have to decarboxylize, the THCA, meaning remove the carboxyl/acid group, to get high.   This is done usually through heat which is why you can cook or burn marijuana to get the effects. At the same time, there are other ways to decarboxylize the THCA. For example, if you leave marijuana in alcohol (liquor, not rubbing) for about 60 days, it will remove the carboxyl group allowing you to drink marijuana and get high. This is the purpose of a marijuana tincture. That would be how you drink it if that's your goal."

I used to use oreo cookies or ice cream and mix it in.  It will work.   For best results, have a smoke about 30 minutes after you've eaten it.   IME, it takes the better part of an hour to kick in.  Do NOT eat too much, or you won't have fun.   I'd recommend less than 1 g, and use that remaining part to smoke.    If you're not high enough after a few hours, do a bit more.   This kind of high tends to last a long time, be prepared for that."

I want you to try a test. Drink a lot of water and then the next time you go to the bathroom check your urine. After this begin your next step of drinking a lot of water and check your urine again when you have to pee again. You might notice that the second pee will be much clearer and less yellow than the first time. This is what you want. When you end up getting tested, do not preform a urine test with your ""first pee"", your chances will be better. Exercise, exercise, exercise. However, do not exercise within a few days of the test, or at least keep exercise to a minimum. When taking your test, let the fist 1-2 second of pee go into toilet, and then pee into sample."

To try to help with OP's questions.  Parents wise honesty is the best policy. Sit down, talk to them, look them in the eye. Give them precise points and facts why you smoke, what it's helped you with, ect. Don't get emotional. Be professional. Worked for my straight edge parents.   Concerning the test. Workout and drink water all the way up to the test. The more the better. THC is stored in fat cells. Working out helps to burn it off quicker. Sauna's are great for the day of the test. Because the day of the test you want to be as lazy as possible. Don't exert yourself. Why? fat cells get burned and THC is now in your system. So just drink lots of water, eat a banana (puts potassium back in your piss) and cross your fingers. The more time you have, the better. Heavy smoker = more time.

If you are sufferring from depression, you should seek out a licensed therapist to help you through your depression.  You are never going to get over your depression by drowning it in a substance.

saplings,354bfu,ThrowaMay420GrazeIt,14,Thu May 7 00:09:16 2015 UTC,Step one: Hit the joint(just a little bit)  Step two: Breath in some fresh air (but don't breath out)(the weed smoke I mean)  Step 3: Hold for 2-3 seconds  Step four: exhale
saplings,354bfu,Futuristic_,5,Thu May 7 00:51:48 2015 UTC,The holding isn't even entirely required. By the time you exhale you've already had it in for a bit. Good to get every last drop though hahaha.
saplings,354bfu,PickleMcDickleson,-2,Thu May 7 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"So inhale it, then exhale it? As opposed to?"
saplings,354bfu,streetlamp69,1 point,Thu May 7 05:32:28 2015 UTC,I just mean that by the time you take a breath of fresh air and go to push it out you're already taking a few seconds.
saplings,354bfu,PickleMcDickleson,1 point,Thu May 7 12:15:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of the issue is also the temperature of the smoke. The less time you hold it in your mouth, the hotter it stays. It also doesn't gain any moisture if you take it all in right away.   I usually use a bong for these reasons. A bong with hot water or spearmint tea is even better than one filled to the brim with crushed ice."
saplings,354bfu,Thor_Odinson_,1 point,Thu May 7 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"Perfect, short description. Additionally, inhale very slowly in step 1, (and for a very short amount of time) and inhale faster during step 2."
saplings,354bfu,Darkreidos,4,Thu May 7 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"The first time I smoked, two guys from Colorado taught me how to hit a joint. We were--amusingly--in Jamaica, but they brought their own weed.   hold joint loosely between fingers, enough to hold it, but not smash the air-path.  Bring to mouth. While keeping a hole in the middle of your lips just right to bring smoke in, crack both sides of your lips the slightest bit open so you have some air leaking in at the same time you are bringing in smoke.  Make sure to breath enough fresh air at the end of your hit to keep your throat clear of smoke while you hold it, assuming you are holding it. This reduces the irritation in your throat."
saplings,354bfu,Thor_Odinson_,2,Thu May 7 13:12:07 2015 UTC,"Pull air into your mouth with your lips forming a seal around the filter/crutch of the j.   Pull the J away from your mouth.  Open your mouth all the way, the vacuum will keep the smoke in.   Breath in all the way and hold it for like 2 seconds.   Exhale all the way.   Breath normally.  DON'T FIGHT COUGHS. JUST LET THEM HAPPEN."
saplings,354bfu,Windfiar,2,Thu May 7 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"You would want to take small little hits until your used to it, but when you suck in take in another breath without breathing anything in. It should go:  suck on joint > take away from mouth > deep inhale to drag into your lungs fully > 3 seconds (95% of cannabinoids will be absorbed roughly) > exhale after 3.  Have some thick food/drink nearby, water is good but thick stuff really helps IMO.  Alternatively, hit a bong/bubbler as it will be a lot smoother, just dont do big hits, just small hits. Even if its a bare bones bong with just a downstem into water it will still help a lot in making it smoother, but the more filtration the easier it will be to take a hit, again just dont take a big hit because i find if i take a massive hit through a bong inhale and exhale is fine and smooth, but i cough after it."
saplings,354bfu,D1STURBED36,1 point,Thu May 7 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"Inhale a bit of smoke, keep inhaling regular air afterwards and blow out both after a second or two. But slow and steady intake of breath for the hit and you should be solid."
saplings,354bfu,smokepitt,0,Thu May 7 10:28:47 2015 UTC,Put the joint to your lips and breathe in the smoke. Pull the joint away from your lips and breathe into your lungs. Hold for approx. 5 seconds. Exhale.

saplings,350kbu,D1STURBED36,-1,Wed May 6 20:51:48 2015 UTC,MFLB = upside down  smoking anything = normal grind
saplings,350kbu,D1STURBED36,1 point,Wed May 6 16:40:19 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask why you do it upside down only for the flight box?
saplings,350kbu,FriedShrekels,0,Wed May 6 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"For the MFLB the finer the grind the better the vape, while smoking (pipe/bong mostly. I dont really smoke much now though since i got a MFLB) you dont need a finer grind then a grinder gives you first run normally."
saplings,350kbu,Braatzwurst,1 point,Wed May 6 17:34:12 2015 UTC,I suppose. I like the finer grind because I feel it packs better in bowls and joints but it's honestly probably not that much of a difference. Placebo effect and all that.  How is your Flight Box? I've been curious how it's different from smoking besides being able to make firecrackers super easily.
saplings,350kbu,D1STURBED36,0,Wed May 6 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"I like the MFLB, however you will either like it or you wont. I hate how /r/trees blindly recommends it and the pax, because honestly the MFLB and the pax are really not the best vapes on the market, or cheapest as there both a fair few years old now, however for me it was between the mflb and the flowermate, and i preffered the MFLB's ability to heat up in 5 seconds, rather then spend awhile heating up, especially if you only want a small amount, rather then a full session (the MFLB still does great in sessions though)"
saplings,350kbu,Braatzwurst,1 point,Wed May 6 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"What makes such a difference in vapes that certain ones are good and bad based on the individual? As far as I understand it's just convection heating weed and breathing that in. How would different vaporizers differ from person to person if they all do pretty much the same thing? I know about quality vapes and burning your bud in bad ones, but the MFLB seems to have strictly positive reviews for construction, size, and product? What would it male ot good for you and say bad for me?  (II'm a complete sapling especially with vapes. Sorry.)"
saplings,350kbu,D1STURBED36,0,Wed May 6 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"When you first physically get the MFLB, you get an impression that the company really does have genuine care, and has strong craftsmanship. And then when you use it, you understand that it really is a fully manual vape, and you fully control your experience (eg draw speed to control temperature). Its hard to describe unless you've actually used one.   The MFLB has a very ""intimate"" feel to it, like its unique to you and ive described it as having a ""soul"", and i find it really enjoyable mastering your technique to get the most out of it and enjoy it. I really like that aspect, but others might not give a flying fuck and just want a vape where they can press a button, wait a bit and get nice hits easily with no technique required.  They all vaporize yea, but theres certain aspects about each vape that you may find more important, and they all have downsides. Its about finding the vape with as many upsides and as little downsides, for example the pax 2's speciality is being discreet because it is very small and not obvious at first what it is (mp3 player? etc) however that may not be important to you becasue you dont need to hide it/live in a legal state/whatever.  For me, some reasons why i chose the MFLB were because of its size, lifetime warranty, no long heat up times (also i can take 1 hit then put it down, which you cant really do with a ""session"" vape), price. The ""downsides"" dont really matter to me, eg needing a technique, doesnt produce big clouds (i find this an upside though.. some people like having big clouds but it seems wasteful), no precise temperature control...  The MFLB is a fantastic vape dont get me wrong, with a great size (battery sort of ruins it though..) and is of high quality construction, its just that if you dont realize what its advantages/disadvantages are you could easily be disappointed."

saplings,3506il,Professor_Pyro,3,Wed May 6 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"The blue haze is because your piece is silver fumed.  If you let it get dirtier, it will get bluer, but looks basically clear when clean.  Pouring salt and isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol (as high % as you can get) in your piece and shaking it will breakdown and dislodge most resin.  For more difficult places, you may need a brush as well."
saplings,3506il,Hybyscus,3,Wed May 6 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"Color changing glass is often desirable, so don't be afraid of the blue. If you went to a head shop and didn't tell them you're new to smoking, they probably thought you knew or they would've told you."
saplings,3506il,floracollossus,3,Wed May 6 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Isopropyl alcohol as the solevent, and then salt as an abrasive. Coarser the salt the better. You can cover the holes with electrical tape or something if you'd like. Afterwards just run some water through to rinse it out. Also you might find running a pipe cleaner dipped in alcohol through is useful, although it probably won't touch anything other than the narrow part on this piece."
saplings,3506il,Blackllama79,1 point,Wed May 6 03:13:35 2015 UTC,Pipe cleaners surprisingly make really good pipe cleaners.

saplings,350ft5,ManiacL,5,Wed May 6 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"If you rarely smoke it will be undetectable within a few days to a week of using. THC tends to store in fat cells and can linger for a long time (months after not using).  Other factors are how often you use and weight. If you are fit/skinny and have only smoked twice it will be in and out or even undetectable. Now everyone is different and while I don't have a time table breakdown I have had very skinny friends pass drug test the next day after lighting up.  Drink lots of water but also remember that if your pee is to ""clean"" some places will be suspicious and make you test again. The reason for juice and other ""detox"" drinks is to flood the body of vitamins and basically pee out everything you can while also covering any ""inconsistencies"".  If you are not a daily or weekly user this is nothing to worry about."

I like doing that until we run out and are just smoking resin."
saplings,34ztak,lotiro,4,Wed May 6 23:44:27 2015 UTC,Smoke whatever is in the bowl until it's all ash. You can see if it is by poking it. If it disintegrates (hence ash) it's over.
saplings,34ztak,jimmycrickt,3,Wed May 6 00:03:44 2015 UTC,"Smoke until the whole bowl is white and black ashes. If it's green and black, it's not done."

saplings,34zmvl,serblackfly,4,Tue May 5 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"On the note of the MFLB, I actually imagine it to be a bit stealthier than the pax (never used a pax, just speculation), just because you can palm it in your hand. Especially if you hit it 'native' (Without the glass stem) it'll just look like you're holding your hand over your mouth or touching your face for some reason. Unless you've got small hands or they're right next to you, it's pretty stealthy.  Other people are recommending dugout/1 hitter, but I do think for over all stealth a vape is better because of reduced smell. It's still present, but will dissipate faster and will not stick to your clothes as much.  Realistically, you don't want a piece you won't like. Especially when they cost as much as they do. I wouldn't fret too much about the details, just try to figure out a portable vape that you think you will enjoy.  As far as other portable vapes, there is the flowermate, and I've heard really great things about the arizer air (Probably a bit too big, but I thought it was worth mentioning.)."

My girlfriend works for a vet, so I apologize if this reads as harsh, but I hear about people that make irresponsible decisions all the time because they don't want to spend money, and their pets are the ones that pay the price."
saplings,34v8t9,francis_hunter_brosh,5,Tue May 5 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you're right, of course. All of this is true. You might say that my thinking here is a bit nihilistic, after all, I have to avoid my own medical problems for fear of cost because I am very poor. So taking a, ""Only if it becomes a problem"" route is a part of my way of life. I can see that it's irresponsible in one way to say that, but from my life experience, also quite reasonable.  My personal opinion is that a majority of pet ownerships are fundamentally irresponsible, as-is. So nihilistic as it is, I view the whole 'society and pets' situation as a bit hopeless altogether. I apologize for coming off as flippant, but I have trouble seeing it another way."
saplings,34v8t9,DrQuaid,1 point,Tue May 5 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"That's fair, I simply implore you to provide medical advice only when it is evidence-based, as someone with more resources and/or different priorities might avoid medical care out of false sense of assurance.  That being said, I don't think you're wrong about a majority (or at least a large number) of pet owners, but I like to hope we can all aspire to be better. We may not ever be 100% successful, but every step along the way is a meaningful one."

saplings,34u677,1884848199939,15,Mon May 4 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"Getting the right dose will be a lot easier if you use a pipe, because pipes are easier to set down and leave for a while.  My general recommendation is to take a hit and wait 20-30 minutes.  After 20-30 minutes, take an introspective and assess the high.  Mild or nonexistent? Take another hit, and wait another 20-30 minutes.  Rinse, repeat, until you reach a comfortable high.    If after two or three hits there is no effect, try only waiting 10-15 minutes between two hits.  DO NOT take a hit, wait 30 minutes, realize nothing is happening, then immediately spark up a bong.  That would be like drinking a beer, not feeling anything, then chugging a bottle of vodka.  People also react to marijuana differently.  If your friend reacts poorly, you don't want them to have just smoked an entire bowl and proceed to freak the fuck out.  Introduce the drug slowly, enjoy the process, and make an afternoon and evening of it."

saplings,34u677,sylas_zanj,9,Mon May 4 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"You should pack the bowl tightly enough that wind will not blow the weed out, but not so tight that it is difficult to inhale through.  The biggest concern with wind should be blowing the lighter out.

saplings,34u677,D1STURBED36,1 point,Mon May 4 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"/u/sylas_zanj made some great points. What I'll throw in is to make sure you give him a little intro lesson on inhaling, as a lot of people don't do it right the first few times, and as a result don't get high.  Tell him to make sure when he's inhaling, that he uses his diaphragm/lower chest muscles to draw air in. You can tell this is being done right when his lower belly expands outwards, rather than his ribs expanding and rising. Tell him not to focus on ""sucking"" the smoke like you would a straw, as this has a tendency to only fill the mouth and throat with smoke. Because of this difficulty breathing, I would advise packing him a small bong bowl for the first time, as it's impossible to draw from a bong wrongly (if the smoke goes up and out of the bong, it's in your lungs. the amount of pressure needed forces full inhalation).  Also the best method to avoid crazy coughing from the first smoke, is to stop inhaling when his lungs are about 80% full, and finish with some fresh air. Then he should slowly push the smoke out, all at once, and then slowly draw regular air in. One of the biggest triggers of coughing fits is coughing the smoke out, and then sucking in a breath of fresh air too quickly. Often the sudden temperature changes (hot smoke, cool air) causes the throat to spasm."
saplings,34u677,D1STURBED36,1 point,Mon May 4 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"Wait, aren't you supposed to suck it in like a straw, fill your mouth (or how much you feel confortable with) and then inhale it into the lungs whilw bringing in fresh air as well?

saplings,34tkoa,Pleatnov,1 point,Mon May 4 13:44:58 2015 UTC,"That is mold, and that weed is trash. It looks really shitty, I would not smoke it. If you really want to save it, try to cut out all the parts that look gray and gnarly.  If you get weed that's literally damp, someone's added water to make it seem like more than it is. Weed that has not been fully dried will feel ""dry"", just very springy and hard to break off/grind. It shouldn't feel wet or damp.  If it's just not dry enough, your best course of action is to toss in one of those ""silica gel"" packets that come in boxes of shoes, some food items, etc. Leave it in for a few days, shaking the bag up gently to move it around. Keep checking the weed until it's dry enough that it's just a tiny bit bendy. If you don't have silica gel, rice bundled up in a paper towel is a cheap alternative, but may take much longer (and you'll also have to swap the rice out probably).  If you end up drying it like this, I suggest once it's dry enough, that you ""cure"" it. If it was not properly dried, chances are it wasn't properly cured either. Curing is the process in which dry cannabis is allowed to grow more potent and flavorful. You do this by putting it in a glass jar, and ""burping"" it (opening the jar for 5 minutes or so) once a day. Do this for around 10 days."

saplings,34r0nt,Lets_Get_It_,10,Sun May 3 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"Where can I get information on how to use Marijuana medically to deal with depression, ADHD, anxiety, insomnia etc.?   Leafly!   I'm concerned that I'm going to get to high during the day and not be able to function.   Then you'll want to check out strains with higher CBD and lower THC (i.e. all many of the medicinal benefits and little to none of the psychotropic THC ""high"" feeling).  This sub: /r/CBD is another great resource.  Edit: corrected my wording.  For optimal medicinal results, I believe the 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of CBD to THC is ideal, not ""just"" CBD."
saplings,34r0nt,happyself,3,Sun May 3 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"/u/Lets_Get_It_ I'd like to add that the above information is not the best. CBD is NOT the ""medicinal"" component to marijuana. While it holds a lot of medical benefits for a lot of problems and is only mildly psychoactive, THC has medical benefits for many issues as well. Especially ADHD, I'd say that THC is way more beneficial than CBD. Same maybe with depression, although both may be part of that treatment.  For ADHD, it's all about dose and timing. You need a pretty low dose to prevent zoning out in the morning and not being able to control what you focus on. I'm talking barely getting high [2]-[3]. And vape at least 20 or so minutes before doing anything engaging so that the initial peak isn't interferring with you. Now I'll admit that this isn't an effective sole treatment for ADHD. It only lasts a few hours and can be inconsistent, and you probably don't want to be redosing all day. So I use it in conjunction with my adderall. I don't always vape in the morning either, what works really nice is waiting until mid afternoon when the adderall begins to wear off, and smoking or vaping lightly then. It'll make that crash go away and allow you to stay motivated. And then using more at night keeps that nasty amphetamine low from affecting you and makes sleeping way easier.  I'm not sure you can use it to effectively treat depression at the same time, especially with anxiety too. ""Treating"" depression is a strange term as medicine alone is usually not enough for anything above light grade depression. You can take medicine that manages the symptoms, but lasting progress has to be made by you, and will require effort alongside that treatment. Higher doses of cannabis (higher than you would use for ADHD management anyway) do a great job at this. It helps you regulate sleeping and eating, the euphoria and positive vibes help get rid of that hopelessness. But overusing any medication to manage those constantly won't solve your problems, and I'd argue that cannabis is often more likely to keep you dissuaded from making progress there. Especially since regular use of cannabis can increase symptoms of anxiety at higher doses. Make sure to check with a psychologist (preferable to a general psychiatrist) to confirm these are really your root issues. A lot of these recurring symptoms can stem from a psychological issue that you might not be aware of, and can be better treated."

Purple depends on the strain and it's genetics (Ex.Purple Kush, Granddaddy Purple, Purple Diesel, ect. all naturally grow with purple) or because of the way it was grown. Cold can cause pretty much any strain to turn purple. Also Indica dominant strains typically grow purple more than Sativa dominant strains.

saplings,34qh47,BossaruMan,9,Sun May 3 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"To preface, marijuana affects every individual in different ways, so there is no definitive coverall as to how much, how often, how high, or whatever someone has to smoke to be safe or to be brain-dead. What we can use as a good base are common trends that have been brought out from various studies.  Anyway, in all seriousness, smoking at your age is certainly doing more harm than good, even if it's just the risk alone. The brain fully finishes developing at age 24, specifically the frontal lobe. Stunting of the frontal lobe can limit the amount of knowledge you can actually learn, and can make continued learning more difficult than someone with an average brain.   Now, with a lot of problems associated with marijuana use, it really matters how often you smoke rather than how much you smoke per session. Even the quality of the marijuana doesn't matter too entirely much. Someone who smokes 3 times per week is definitely going to be worse off than someone who smokes 3 times per month. But let's be honest here: you only have one brain, so why risk it?  If I were you, I would seriously and strongly consider not smoking anymore until you are at least 20 years old. At least get out of the teenage years. Your chances of legitimate brain impairment drop dramatically once you reach actual ""adulthood""."

It seems that generally at normal doses and frequencies, little permanent harm is done after around 17. The highest risk seems to be anytime prior to age 16.  I think OP should definitely not smoke regularly at all. I think that the rate he is currently smoking probably hasn't caused any kind of severe harm, but it's not a frequency I would maintain at that age. I would cut back to at most once a month, and to be honest, your best bet would be to make it a rare indulgence until you're at least 17."

Marijuana tends to give me a lot of motivation, (even only doing it every couple weeks) and overall improves my happiness.   To be honest though, I would believe those studies despite not having any sources. As far as I know, pretty much anything can fuck with the developing brain.   Again, I'm just a teenager and probably have no clue as to what I'm talking about, but it's what I think. I'll probably cut back to once a month, and keep it at that.

saplings,34rxyt,PickleMcDickleson,3,Mon May 4 01:19:26 2015 UTC,I dont see where that would be bad I've done it for friends before and as long as you ask and offer compensation for him to middleman till you get a solid connect it should be alright and shouldn't be impolite
saplings,34rxyt,thedevilandgods,2,Mon May 4 01:37:19 2015 UTC,I pick up for my friend all the damn time lol. It isn't really weird unless you don't trust or know the people very well
saplings,34rxyt,cherchellito9,2,Mon May 4 04:20:45 2015 UTC,"Let me give it to you from the dealer perspective.  As a dealer, your job is to make money, and stay safe.  Best way to do that is by keeping an inner network of people you can trust, and having them be your work horses.  Could I buy a QP and turn around and sell it in grams and eighths and make a fuck ton of money?  Probably, but that's both time consuming and pretty dangerous for me in the mean time.  Or should I buy a QP, turn around and sell an ounce to 4 close friends, make less money, but have them do the work for me.  Obviously things aren't always in this grand (or small) scale, but the principle is the same.    The only thing about a middle man scenario is you gotta trust your middle man, because you will likely have to pay up front unless his dealer is the most legit dude in the world.  Either way, just be respectful of your friend.  Remember, lots of stoners are super nice people just lookin to get high like yourself."

saplings,34pxxw,Sketches-,3,Sun May 3 14:42:11 2015 UTC,Honestly just watch some youtube videos on how to roll and then practice yourself with just using tobacco. You can keep using new papers by ripping the attempts and re-using the tobacco with new papers. After you have done a fair few you should get the hand of it.
saplings,34pxxw,HazardousLoL,2,Sun May 3 14:53:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I would say practice using tobacco since it would be more expensive to practice with weed or with any kitchen herbs (you ever notice how damn expensive they are?!?).
saplings,34pxxw,titsonmymind,2,Sun May 3 15:11:05 2015 UTC,Practice makes perfect. Look at the pencil method on the sidebar and try to recreate it so it over and over until your bored of it
saplings,34pxxw,YourRapeyTeacher,2,Sun May 3 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"Alright. so what you wanna do is watch cheech and chong. I can't recall which movie it was but it was either the 1st movie or second movie. Chong rolls up a joint fairly quickly in one of them, and I think the camera shows it fairly well. That's how I learned how to roll a joint"
saplings,34pxxw,Pony2013,-1,Sun May 3 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, find a movie and hope to find the part where they roll a joint.. In one of the 2 movies.  Or you could, you know, google it?"
saplings,34pxxw,D1STURBED36,2,Sun May 3 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're both good movies so you aren't really at a complete loss. And I think it happens fairly early in one of the movies. Seems like a win-win."
saplings,34pxxw,Pony2013,1 point,Sun May 3 17:47:43 2015 UTC,Blunt tobacco works perfect you get plenty to practice with for a couple bucks and buy papers in bulk on amazon.
saplings,34pxxw,Carbongiaraffe,1 point,Sun May 3 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"Just practise, no amount of videos and tutorials will do you if you dont practise. Or rolling machine."
saplings,34pxxw,D1STURBED36,1 point,Sun May 3 17:30:38 2015 UTC,Buy a pack of 100 elements papers and just take the weed out after you've rolled a j then roll another.
saplings,34pxxw,jaycogs,1 point,Sun May 3 19:48:20 2015 UTC,Try rolling your papes into a cone and then fill it with weed!
saplings,34pxxw,0verw8,1 point,Sun May 3 20:15:09 2015 UTC,You can practice with tea or just use weed and take it out the paper when you are done.
saplings,34qze3,ihateusernames1109,2,Sun May 3 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"Don't grind your herb in a grinder just shred it up with your hands, if it's good bud you'll be able to form a fairly solid structure that you put in the crease of your paper. Also a roach is good too just get like card stock paper and cut a little strip off roll it up and stick it at the inhaling end of  the paper with the bud in front of it. Now take your non glue end of the paper and roll it under the bud and roach, lick the glue and finish the j. Now all you need to do is tap down the open end a little and if you want get another paper, rip off the glue and cut it in like half and wrap it around the paper with the roach"
saplings,34qze3,Whisper06,2,Sun May 3 20:42:53 2015 UTC,What brand papers have the glue? All I can ever find is RAW and none have glue
saplings,34qze3,gameofthroffice,2,Sun May 3 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"raws (sold in the UK anyway) have glue on one side of them, it says on the packet ""natural Arabic gum"". I'd recommend if you're new to rolling get some rizla blue super kings or 'rips' off of eBay.  Rizla green have cut corners which can be useful if you're just learning to roll, but I find them too thick for my liking."

saplings,34qze3,Elvelution,2,Mon May 4 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"Idk man, I'm staring at them and don't see any glue. I am at a [8] so I'll check again after my Chinese food gets here"

saplings,34pp08,1884848199939,2,Sun May 3 12:57:01 2015 UTC,"Visine works well for me (I can't use it with my contacts though). I would be cautious about using eye drops all the time though, your eyes can build up a tolerance or worse slow/minimize your tear production."
saplings,34pp08,slepbet1,2,Sun May 3 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"Came here to confirm.    I agree with /u/TheAngryBlueberry.  It's been years since I've used them, but Rhoto's work insanely well.  I've always felt that the green lid bottles are the best.  They are a redness reliever as well as lubricant.  They have other types that are lubricants only.  But yes, it feels like chewing on mint bubblegum with your eyeballs.  Very intense, but your eyeballs will be completely devoid of any red."
saplings,34pp08,ForeverBronze1,4,Mon May 4 21:37:58 2015 UTC,Rhoto's; you know they're working when Jack Frost is ball deep in your eye sockets.

saplings,34pvvi,rndmreview,9,Sun May 3 14:19:59 2015 UTC,Yeah you grow to love it. You'll smell skunk on the highway and look around to see who's blazing.
saplings,34pvvi,leon__furious,3,Sun May 3 16:04:27 2015 UTC,Different strains have different tastes and smells. If you don't like the taste of one try another and if that doesn't work then I'm sure offer Time you will get used to it
saplings,34pvvi,YourRapeyTeacher,1 point,Sun May 3 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah you not only get used to it but over time you grow to appreciate it.  I was the same way about 15 yrs ago. Then, I started hanging more with friends that did it instead of walking away or staying inside when they left. I tried it and it was bearable but I loved the feeling. I got used to the different scents and smells. Then, I grew my own and I found a deeper appreciation when my plants' smell went from fresh cut grass to oooooweeeee lol. Give it time. Savor the flavor.   Best thing to do is to expose yourself to it more often so you can get used to it faster."
saplings,34pvvi,anthonytaurus,1 point,Sun May 3 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"With edibles, yea..  Smoking/vaping wise i dont really taste much (smell, fuck yea theres a ton of that).  IMO smoked/vaped it tastes a lot different then it smells, and to me there both good (except if you have a piece and its resin'd up.. that shit tastes nasty)"
saplings,34pvvi,D1STURBED36,1 point,Sun May 3 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"I think it is an acquired smell/taste. I remember thinking back when I didn't smoke that it smelled like a skunk so I associated that smell with something negative. Once I started smoking though, I saw all the benefits of smoking at I had a change of perception. For taste, I would say that you should try a vaporizer. I really enjoy the taste of the vaporized weed apposed to the sooty taste you can get from actually igniting the weed."
saplings,34pvvi,slepbet1,1 point,Sun May 3 19:13:26 2015 UTC,You will grow to love it. You'll get to the point where you'll smell a skunk & be like mmmm that smells good. Edibles you just need to get some from a company or person that makes really good ones.  Mile High Mints taste identical to Andes Mints. I can't taste the cannabis. Even though each square is 50mg
