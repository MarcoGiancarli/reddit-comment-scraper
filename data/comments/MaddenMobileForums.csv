Reggie White, Antonio Gates, AJ Green, JJ Watt and Bo Jackson more than make up for those 3.3 million coins. You beat the spread by a lot."

My friends and I both did this, and he got lots of players cheaper than I did. Most costly were NTL, Larry Allen, Bo Jackson, Sweetness, Lott and Greene. Then again, my friend ended up paying significantly less for Lott (I paid 500k, he did 200k), so just watch the market! It is essentially like buying two and a half NTLs, to put it into retrospect. I just got MM LT just because he's my favorite LB, where as the Legend you can get for 450k on some days"

Webster, Allen and Munoz are at or near the top of their positions as Mobile Masters (Long is better than Allen for OVR). Rice and Fitz are still the best two WRs in the game even as Mobile Masters. Bo is still the best HB in the game.  Randle is the best DT, NTL is still the best CB, and Lott is still up there as a Mobile Master safety. The funniest similarity to me is the linebacker core. Literally every top Legend LB is one of the top Mobile Masters LBs. Brooks, LT, Lambert and Lewis all translated to Mobile Masters. Too funny."

MaddenMobileForums,3e5425,yamepo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets get technical about this.  So, each device is matched with a specific code, called a UDID. The UDID is the code of the device in which online games can save data to, so say something like those mobster games. When presented with a new UDID, data saved on the online game servers will try to pull any data related to that UDID. Since every device has a unique UDID, it more than likely won't pull your saved data from the server, unless Madden Mobile saves via Client and Online Data together, then the iCloud backup may pull a restore code from the game to get your team back, but as far as I know, Madden doesn't work like that as far as I know. I'm sorry for your loss man.  EDIT: tl;dr, your data is backed up to a server on EA's side, who links it with a device ID which can not be replicated. Also, even if you WERE to know your UDID from your other device, jailbreaking and using a UDID faker is not going to work either. Thinking more into it, since a UDID spoof won't work, the data may be backed up to the iCloud, but I don't see it happening, as Guest accounts are proven to be linked to devices, because if you restore an iPhone, you still have that guest account."

Complete as many achievements as possible, and do the team sets that require bronze and silver trophies. It costs around 5k to complete one, and it gives you a gold player from the team and 7500 coins. You can sell the gold player, or put it into the trophy set, if it doesn't update your team, and start completing more or those sets. That's an easy 32 sets right there. On top of that, completing the SQS and LQS counts for one each, so do those at least once if you haven't already, as well as the mystery set. Updating overall is also a huge part, and if you can, get some players that offer +1% xp, as you can get a total of +5% xp if you have 5 players, and that's the limit for the boost, and that should help with building your overall level. As well as all this, just focus on building your team and maximizing overall!

MaddenMobileForums,3e4ch7,kl1513,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"MM Brady's surprising 78 SPD allows him to be more mobile than most passing QBs, but he's not nearly as fast as MM RGIII or MM Michael Vick.  According to /u/DeadToWrite's spreadsheet, MM Brady is the 10th best player for team OVR in the game. Six of the players ahead of him are WRs (Rice, Fitz, Largent, Brown, Dez & V-Jax) and 3 of them are CBs (MM NTL, MM Sherman and PH Vontae). Given that you can only have a max of three WRs in your line-up, Brady is the 7th highest priority for OVR on any team. Given that you only have 200k, some of these players are not an option for you (i.e. Rice, Fitz, Largent, MM NTL, MM Sherman and apparently MM V-Jax is insanely expensive). So Brady would be your 4th highest priority for OVR (assuming you don't already have players like FE Antonio Brown, PH Dez Bryant and PH Vontae Davis).  But whether or not you should get Brady does not depend on what he does for your team OVR. It depends largely on your offensive line. If you have a good offensive line to protect Brady, then I say go for it. But if your offensive line is built better for a mobile QB (i.e. MM Vick, MM RGIII and PH Wilson), then you should wait before going after Brady. Brady is the best pure passer in the game, but he is not the most mobile QB. Besides, Wilson and RGIII are the 2nd and 3rd best QBs for OVR, respectively. Vick is pretty low on the chart, but I like him because he's the fastest and he has the best combination of throw power and deep ball accuracy in a mobile QB.   The choice is yours, but you should definitely consider the different factors that play into what type of QB you use (i.e. play style & O-line)."

MaddenMobileForums,3e4ch7,Ryan5427,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"I like everyone on that O-line except for Andres Peat. Not a perfect O-line, but a solid one. I would hold off on Brady for now. Try and improve the O-line a little more. I would use RGIII for now. Depending on your WR core, I would sell MM Calvin Johnson still. If he's your best receiver then keep him. If he's not, then sell him when Legend packs are over.   Here's a recommended list of upgrades at each O-line position.  OT   Joe Thomas: 2nd best OT in the game. Goes for ~700k. Dan Dierdorf: 3rd best OT in the game. Not necessary to get if you have Pace, but he's always an upgrade option.    OG   Kyle Long: Best OG in the game. Costs ~800k at least. Josh Sitton: At the moment, Sitton is being vastly over valued on the Auction House. You could always try to get MM Gene Upshaw (3rd best OG in the game), but he costs ~2 million coins. Sitton at max will cost 1 million.    C   Mike Webster: No question. He's the top center in the game. All other 99 centers are pretty expensive too, so I'm you might as well go for the best.    I have no idea whether you'll ever accumulate the coins for these O-line men, but these are my recommendations in case you do. If after awhile you still feel like getting Brady, then go for it. For now I would hold onto MM RGIII."

MaddenMobileForums,3e4ch7,MaddenMobileDude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"For example:  Let's say your QB is MM Michael Vick and one of your WRs is PH Dez Bryant. A play I like to use every now and then is PA HB Curl. After faking the hand off to the HB, I have the option to throw the football. I also have the option to continue rolling out to my left and inching towards the line of scrimmage (which is easier if you continue to roll to one side). Using this play, I've been able to get 10, 20, 50 and 80 yd runs, sometimes for TDs. I may use this play and gain 20 yards on the ground. The next time I use it, if the LBs and DBs bite on my encroaching towards the L.O.S, I'll chuck a bomb to my WR running the deep route.  It's not really read option, but some plays provide the option to run with your QB or pass the ball. There's no read option involving the HB (although there could be after the reset). That's why /u/MaddenMobileDude was asking his preference of play style. He's gauging the importance of mobility."

MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,EAVTank,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"It only makes sense that we should be able to audible. Peyton Manning can audible. After awhile, QBs like Matt Schaub can audible. Hell! When you're in your first season of season mode, any QB can audible. I know this cause Ryan Tannehill would audible whenever I used FG block on a normal down."
MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,Reereez95,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:01 2015 UTC,I want receivers to be able to catch the ball in stride
MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,JamarcusRussel,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"(8) Pump fake ability  Fumbling is a part of the sport of football, but I do know what you mean. It feels like every time you do a spin move the ball comes out of your hands. That's pretty annoying. Penalties for encroachment seems like something that would be restricted to Season Mode only, assuming the mechanics of H2H remain the same. The defense likely would not encroach if its being controlled by the CPU.   I'm glad you brought up the ridiculousness that is countering. EA makes it seem like defensive awareness is vital to defensive play. That's a crock of shit, cause the only thing that matters is what plays you've countered. You can have 99% defensive awareness and it will mean nothing. Your defense will be passive and reactionary. It's only when plays are countered that the defense ever does anything, and at that point it's unrealistic. I have never seen an NFL game where the entire defensive line busted through the offensive line untouched. There's no point in getting better linemen if they're all going to be chickens with their heads cut off when a play is countered.   EA needs to make defensive play more realistic. They make all H2H match ups revolve around countering, and yet there are plays that are clearly broken (I'm looking at you Slants middle). For the longest time the slot was a broken and useless position. Tbh, when you have the best defense in the game (or damn well near it), your defense should act like every play is countered. Not necessarily when it's early into the new season and 99 OVR cards haven't even been released yet. But when you have a top-MM squad with Dom Sherm and Easter Rod Woodson mixed in? Yeah, it's B.S.  And hopefully that childish ""easy mode"" tournament setting is gone after the reset. EA should just do a better job to match leagues with similar OVRs. That way people can learn, rather than taking a beating from a league of all 105 OVR teams."
MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,Reereez95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Some plays like WR screen, HB screen wk are among those that can't be countered and allowing players to pick which plays they want their defense to run when a player runs a certain offensive play. Pump fakes would be an interesting addition. I don't u derstand why EA can't at least have all the things that NFL Pro 2014 has. Whenever I play H2H, I can recognize when the other team has a certain play countered but there's no way for me to audible. This has to be the most frustrating thing for me.  The reason I said something about fumbles is because they add an unnecessary element to game where luck seemingly overcomes skill completely. If there are going to be fumbles, there HAS to be a way to protect the ball at the cost of speed and mobility like there is on console."
MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,Reereez95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, knowing a play is countered but being powerless against it is an aggravating feeling.   Good point about the fumbles! I know that phone screens are limited, but it would be nice to have more specialized buttons (or at least the choice to have these buttons on the screen). The ""skill"" button randomly selects which skill move will be used, and it's usually spin (which happens to lead to fumbles when badly timed). Every once in awhile it will protect the ball and rarely the ""skill move"" button will stiff arm a player. But I'd like to choose which skill move I use, not leave it up to chance!  Some players will still fumble the ball more than others, but that's because their carry is (supposedly) modeled after the real life NFL player. So Stevan Ridley will fumble a bit because he has done so frequently in recent seasons. But in general, there should be more than one skill button that allows you to do different things (i.e. a stiff arm button)."
MaddenMobileForums,3e3bs4,soenottelling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"Not necesaary.  Just adds a layer of extra button presses the mobile probably can't handle easily.   Yes please.  Simple.  When you slept a play you can manually create an audible that is linked to that play, that way at the line you just press the action button to call that audible you have set for the play.  Helps.to not break the game too since the machine can't change the way a human could. Have to find a way to make it not as broken when the ai does it.  Option?  1.  Increase fumble rate heavily when you scramble.  2. Put a time limit on scrambles so you can only ACTIVATE the scramble option after, say, 4 seconds or something and to do so you have to press the action button which turns you I to a full on rb mode at that point. Yessssss.  They need to do something like have a play set that counters that play well and then give all defenders +10 to all stats or something....not just some linemen that stand still.  No.  You can't cross the line already and on phones it's already hard enough to deal with the small layout.  What they should do instead is give you a movement buff when you are still in your stance, that way ppl aren't penalized as much as they are rewarded for not just pushing up against the line. Nah, turbo has always kinda been an unnecessary button.  You almost always just hold it down at all times anyway, so why force another button on a mobile format....would be an awful design choice honestly.  If they want to implement something like that, they could always just make trucking with nobody around give you a slight turbo boost or something, but I'm still not a fan of forcing you to swipe a ton just cuz. Yes.  Or at the very least a reward structure that isn't so top heavy.  You have to win 10 sb to get a sb pack.  That's a lot of season goes before u actually see anything out of them besides the normal coin amount (which isn't how u make coins in madden obviously anyway).   .  My own?  I think defense needs to be reworked entirely for h2h.  Since we aren't playing directly, we need to be able to set up counters but also set up preferred plays.  If you build your team as a 3-4 defense, you should have the option for the machine to play more 3-4if you know your opponent has a bad rb, you should be able to opt to use more pass heavy plays.  Heck, I'd love to see the option to add a ""spy/dt"" option where you can take any play you have set in amatch-up and choose to take a player and turn them into a qb spy (in part to counter the ability to scramble they hopefully would add) and in part to allow your team to have meaningful double teams for when you KNOW the player is going to throw to thier 99 #1 receiver most likely instead of thier 87 #2 or thier 75 in the slot.  The more hands on we are allowed to be with our defense the more fun it will be.  Also, I'd like to see a ""last play"" button for h2h, or even better, a ""key play"" button (I mean..they had it before...) where we can see the most important play of the last drive, allowing you to better see how your defense plays.  Was that fumble a fluke? Or was it because you called a spy out on the qb that play and the guy tried to scramble?    Finally, I'd like to see more game stats.  I'd love for the season mode to have player stats, make them generic if need be, but seeing that my qb has thrown for more yards or Patrick willis have 5 more int than anybody else is one of the reasons I enjoy madden (console) in the first place.  The stats of the mobile are sorely lacking.  I'd love to see my points per a game and yd stats, how many picks I threw in a season or...a..h2h season.  Last idea.  H2h seasons.  All other phone games have them.  It's a great way to give rewards out to players and keeps them interested. The h2h here had little.incentive u til the season ending 100% stuff.  Give us legit 16 game, 1 a day seasons where we are rewarded for having a good season, making it to the sb, winning it all, etc etc.    .  I guess I just want the game to feel as or more rewarding than shifting though the AH for hours on end."

On another note: if we were to compare all-Division teams, EA has skewed everything in favor of the AFC North. Cause sooooooooo many of the Steelers' players are MMs (or at least 99 OVRs) in this game."
MaddenMobileForums,3e2386,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had an all-steelers team at one point.  The o-line and d-line were only so-so, except for Webster and Mean Joe, and special teams sucked, but the linebacking unit was pretty darn good.  Add the rest of the AFC North (Easter Woodson and Ray Lewis, for instance) and it would be tough to beat."
MaddenMobileForums,3e2386,soenottelling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of forgot that the Steelers' lines on both offense and defense are just so-so in this game. Still a tough team, but when you factor in the rest of the division?  QB: Otto Graham (99)  HB: LeVeon Bell (99)  HB Flex: Franco Harris (98)  WR: AJ Green (99)  WR: Antonio Brown (99)  TE: Maxx Williams (94)  Slot Flex: open  OT: Joe Thomas (99)  OT: Anthony Munoz (99)  OG: Clint Boling (96)   OG: Marshall Yanda (96)  C: Mike Webster (99)  DE: Justin Smith (92)  DE: Carlos Dunlaps (92)  DT: Mean Joe Greene (99)  DT: Danny Shelton (96)  LB: James Harrison (99)  LB: Jack Ham (99)  MLB: Jack Lambert (99)  3-4 ILB: Ray Lewis (99)  CB: Joe Haden (99)  CB: William Gay/Jimmy Smith (93)  FS: Rod Woodson (99)  SS: Ed Reed (99)  Nickel: Tashaun Gipson (98)  Dime: Troy Polamalu (98)  That's a pretty damn good team right there. I hesitated at putting Maxx Williams in because his +1 CAT brings Green and Brown down from 100 CAT to 99 CAT. I put him in just cause he's the TE in the AFC North with the highest OVR.  Questionable positions in an all-AFC North line up would be slot receiver, defensive end and the 2nd cornerback spot. Slot receiver I left open because it was a toss up between Darrius Heyward-Bey and Breshad Perriman. I don't mind Justin Smith, but I'm not so big on Carlos Dunlap at DE. Unfortunately those are the top two DEs in the game from all four teams, and they're the only ones with an OVR higher than 90. Ouch... the CB 2 spot is surprisingly weak, especially when you consider the overwhelming strength at safety (that includes the nickel and dime). This is in large part because I cannot use 95 OVR Rod Woodson from the Steelers, given that he starts as a 99 OVR safety in this line up. I could put him in at CB, but that would make the CB 2 and 95 OVR and one of the safety spots would have to bump down to a 94.   93 + 99 > 94 +95  The options at CB aren't terrible. They're just meager compared to 99 Joe Haden. I couldn't choose between Jimmy Smith and William Gay, so I put them both as options. As a whole, the AFC North has a strong LB core and O-line. These two units also have the most depth on the team. Safety would be next, with a bevy of 94 safeties following the top 4 on the team. If anyone wanted to make an all-AFC North team, they'd have options. And it would be a tough team to beat.  [EDIT]: Almost forgot special teams!   K: Justin Tucker (97)  KR: Jacoby Jones/Brandon Tate (95)  P: Sam Koch (80)  PR: Antonio Brown/Jacoby Jones (95)  The obvious weak point here is Koch. But he's pretty good for an 80 OVR punter. I prefer Jacoby returning kickoffs and Brown returning punts, but I put alternates because the OVRs were the same."

Something that you could put a player in that could tell you what players are better. Maybe incorperate a OVR calculator into the team builder.

MaddenMobileForums,3e09p9,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:53 2015 UTC,This is a pretty great idea. If you could pull from the MutHead database you could use the spreadsheet formula to estimate OVR. It would of course have the same errors that the spreadsheet does but it would still be a good start.

I always have near 100 somehow, post all of them for 5000 BIN on the AH. Come back 4 hours later and you'll have hundreds of thousands of coins. I actually did that this morning, had 4000 coins and posted every single gold player I had onto the AH. Had 460k coins in 4 hours.   Make sure to check the prices for 80+ golds, some go for a lot."

My advice to you...sell NOW.Don't hold on to it for a few days to see how he plays, sell ASAP.  The game is less then 25 days away from resetting...that's 3 weeks.  Sell him, and then sell the coins you get from him.  Even if you sell at 40 million and sell your coins at $5 per mil, that's still $200 you made off a mobile game that's resetting in 3 weeks."

MaddenMobileForums,3dyind,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"They just posted the Pic and nobody commented. Then we started talking about  the fact that you had a collectible too, so the odds are the same in a legend as a pro pack"
MaddenMobileForums,3dyind,bran861,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a Bidding war might get you morre coins but I would go with 35 mil Bid 45 mil BIN.  There's always the chance that in the middle of a bidding war the AH could go down and you'd get a lower value for him cause no one could bid on him again, but if you're willing to take the chance, I would say 10 mil start, 80 mil BIN, with 8-12 HR auction"
MaddenMobileForums,3dyind,Ohmm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:06 2015 UTC,What about bid 35 and BIN 99? See where it goes!

MaddenMobileForums,3dyind,TheNeek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:17 2015 UTC,He recently sold for $50M so you essentially just pulled about $500 from a pack
MaddenMobileForums,3dyind,turkmileymileyturk,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:54 2015 UTC,More like $325...but still

MaddenMobileForums,3e04o2,Thejaysoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"This is my first time giving advice so bear with me here. I would start off with your HB. I'm not sure just how many coins you are getting but I would get a good reliable HB such as TOTW Lynch when TOTY packs are out. I would get 96 POE and maybe make PH sets for your CB's. Maybe pick up a 99 receiver such as Dez, Megatron, or Odell. Maybe pick up Von Miller 99 and sell off the other one. I would also recommend getting a actual fullback such as Marcel Reece or John Kuhn or even 99 Bruce Miller if you have $$$. Lastly, replace Osemele with a better guard such as Boling or Zane Beadles. At 30,000 there's pretty much nothing you can do so I would just recommend getting loads of more coins."

MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,Falcons_241,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"He's great, but IMO still behind Vontae,  His man, speed, and accel all have a 1 point advantage, but Vontae's strength and all around skills are a lot better."
MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,DeadToWrites,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"I am interested in where he ranks on your spreadsheet. I tried swapping regular NTL for Kam because Kam was nerfing Bo, but that drops my Offense OVR to 107 from 108. Not sure if getting Bo to run 1 speed faster is worth losing the plus one to the rest of my players, especially since Bo is at my flex."

MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,Syth1579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,No. Barry has 99 speed. It's just Bo because his speed is 100. It drops it to 99.
MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:37 2015 UTC,I'd take the speed loss. One speed lost to one player but gained by everyone else is better for the team than one speed for one player but lost by everyone else.
MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,Syth1579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:33 2015 UTC,That's what I am thinking.
MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:27 2015 UTC,The strength cannot be understated. It's what also gives NTL a serious advantage over the MM Sherman.
MaddenMobileForums,3dyo7n,Reereez95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"100% behind davis.  I don't even think it's really debatable.  Same height, noticeably worse stats in key spots like tackle, trivial advantages in thing like man coverage with things like slightly worse jump that counter the small advanatage, and worse play rec.  His strength and tackle aren't unplayable low, like deion, but I would rather run legend ntl, sherman, davis, mm ntl (obv), all o er him.  I'd have to see him in the slot but peterson has similar stats and doesn't play all that amazing there imo.  Still, probably a top 5 cb, so worth it for teams that like haden or can't afford sherman/ntl."

MaddenMobileForums,3dznav,ryguy0204,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"I know his prices are high, but if I pulled MM NTL I'd hold onto him. It's relatively easy for me to make coins, so I would just hold onto him. The way I see it: I'm saving 35 - 50 million coins. Then I can save my coins for other upgrades.  Plus, I'm a whore when it comes to good cards. Early in the game, when Legend Irvin meant something, I held onto his card rather than sell it for hundreds of thousands of coins. Of course I sold him by the time he was worthless   :/  That's just the way I am."
MaddenMobileForums,3dznav,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah but let's say he sells for 40mil now, at a price of $7/mil, that's $280 you just made.   Do you want an easy $280 or a card in your lineup that's going to go away in a month?"
MaddenMobileForums,3dznav,fack9gag,0,Mon Jul 20 21:31:19 2015 UTC,"I don't sell coins. If I sold coins, I would sell NTL in heart beat.  Circumstances could change my mind, but for now that's how I feel."

MaddenMobileForums,3dzjaw,DA9485,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:26 2015 UTC,It's a non repeatable set on purpose. They don't want people to keep making and driving down the price of the card.
MaddenMobileForums,3dzjaw,TheNeek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:58 2015 UTC,That only makes sense if rookie cards were easy to obtain. The chance of pulling rookie cards from packs is crazy low and the prices of them on the AH don't vary all that much from the 99 masters card.   The biggest difference I've seen is Ed Reed rookie going for 900k and his masters card going for 1.2mil.
MaddenMobileForums,3dzjaw,JamarcusRussel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:41 2015 UTC,I got an Ed reed Rookie for 400k.  On legend pack weekend it's a free-for-all

Cause if you pulled a Largent MM rookie, you'd be pulling the 3rd best receiver (for OVR) in the game. That's pretty damn good.  As for your question, I don't think there's any specific way. It's all about luck in this game, and there's no specific formula on how to be lucky. And you're talking about pulling MM NTL or Atwater, which are the rarest cards in the game right now (or at least the rarest 99 OVRs). So we're talking about being REALLY lucky.  That being said, I would make coins via alt accounts and have them gift you Legend Packs. I've found that luck will side with the less fortunate sometimes."

MaddenMobileForums,3dz72s,mothershipq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:50 2015 UTC,It's all about luck. Some people bitch when they open Legend Packs without a Legend pull 3 or 4 times in a row.

The Dolphins' punter is a gold 90 and isn't that expensive. That will probably give your STs the boost to reach 95, at least, but will probably stay at 99 OVR. Any little bit will help in the long run, though."

MaddenMobileForums,3dwiyg,Syth1579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:15:21 2015 UTC,I fucked up so hard with the Hekker card. I figured why do I need a 99 punter when I never punt?   Sold him on the AH for 500k. Then EA brings up this legacy team bs. By then all the Hekker cards were 800k.
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,Xrtcoletrain,5,Mon Jul 20 02:06:24 2015 UTC,"Better than what half of the flashback players are worth, most likely."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,Syth1579,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"Only Faulk and Freeney are worth more. Warner sells for about 250k, but you get hit with the AH tax."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:11 2015 UTC,"And idk why Freeney is even worth that much. I hate the card personally. I love the look of Faulk's card, but he wasn't my favorite to play with though."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,Syth1579,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"I liked Faulk, He's no Bo or Barry, but I preferred him over Murray."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"I likes the fact that Murray had both strength and agility trucking to get him out of any situation, and he was really quick too, with great trucking. Plus, because of the player glitch, he became really cheap for what he is, so he takes the cake for me. Faulk moved really majestically though, and stopped on a dime, and Murray seemed to make slow cuts, as opposed to Faulk. I feel slightly more to Murray, but its close to a toss up for me"
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,Syth1579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:31:28 2015 UTC,"Since I like bouncing to the outside, I prefer Faulk. He cut the corner much better and took off. Murray was better up the middle though."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 20 02:35:45 2015 UTC,I'll agree to that. Murray struggled highly in those events where you had to run in that specific circle for me. He would take two seconds to cut back
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,Syth1579,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"If you couldn't have Barry, who would you play at HB and FB?"
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:03 2015 UTC,"MM Bo and Bruce Miller. Next would be Legend/Xmas Bo and Bruce Miller. If you really want a speed agility back, maybe AP and Bo. Getting to the bigger bargain, you have to go Murray. I like Faulk a little better, but the price difference to get him is not worth it over Murray."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:24 2015 UTC,Is AP speed and agility?  I always thought he did strength trucks.
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 20 12:56:44 2015 UTC,"At 92 strength he may not be very good if he is a strength truck. His agility is 97. Be he does have 100 TRU. But he also has 98 ELU, 99 STF, and 99 JKM. I have not used him, so I am more speaking on hearsay. I have used all of the others I named."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:37 2015 UTC,"92's a lot of strength for a halfback.  Only Bo, MM Bo, and MM Lynch have more strength.  FE Morris only has 85 strength, and he strength trucks."
MaddenMobileForums,3dwcle,theskyhooker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:14:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, so maybe it is strength, but if you want strength, obviously Bo makes more sense. I think even his MM is cheaper than AP. But some people want him and Bo. Partly for OVR, partly because when you have guys that fast, as great of a blocker as Miller is, he's not that fast to get to the defender on the outside while your HB is pulling away."

Plus, lots of cards need to be added, taken out, re-rated, everything. If they didn't do a reset, what's the sense of playing anymore? Only the low overall players would get joy from the game, where as the 105 overall people like myself would have done nothing. Without a reset, to put it in the best words, the game would have been senseless."

MaddenMobileForums,3dti69,BMorg1,2,Sun Jul 19 08:29:34 2015 UTC,i got fucking nothing. my last MM pull was cromartie when he first came out... ive pulled at least 30 packs since and ive gotten nothing -.-
MaddenMobileForums,3dti69,kingdylan1,3,Sun Jul 19 08:51:11 2015 UTC,I've now pulled over 130 since the game began and I've never once gotten a single Legend or Legend Rookie. You're luck is still great compared to mine.

Blew half my savings, gonna need to grind that back up again to get largent. All in all it turned out alright i guess"
MaddenMobileForums,3dti69,fappingwaffle,2,Sun Jul 19 09:25:29 2015 UTC,Can we still pull MM cards before 8 EST (when the new events and notifications go off)? Don't want to open them and miss that tiny percentage of something good...
MaddenMobileForums,3dti69,xKizume,2,Sun Jul 19 10:14:56 2015 UTC,"Pulled a bo.  That was a nice surprise.  Now I don't need to buy one, which saves me a some mil to throw at MM v.jax maybe lol.  His gameplay is great. Very fluid and doesn't seem to fumble.  Only thing I have an issue with is he only uses str trucking, which means he has a hard time beating 2 defenders (any back does though).  Too hard to reliably spin on phones sadly so I cant truck juke to the side and then spin like you would want when dealing with a lb followed by the safety.  His speed makes up for the strength truck in most situations though."
MaddenMobileForums,3dti69,soenottelling,2,Sun Jul 19 10:40:49 2015 UTC,Have you tried juking with him yet? He makes some sick plays on jukes for me.

MaddenMobileForums,3dtnfe,AgentAnteater,2,Sun Jul 19 10:08:35 2015 UTC,The real question is why would you even qb sneak with Warner. He's extremely slow and has low strength.

There were MULTIPLE times when the game just went down for no reason and you just got network time outs every second that made the game unplayable. Force closing gone is amazing. Network timeouts have been screwing people over this whole season lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3dtjfa,Falcons_241,2,Sun Jul 19 17:15:54 2015 UTC,"I know this. My point was the system likely won't know the difference between a network timeout and a force close. As it stands now, if you get a network timeout, you get to replay the down. In the next season, if it cannot tell the difference, you will lost the down, even if you just threw an 85 yard bomb TD. So as frustrating as it is now, imagine how much more frustrating it will be if you not only don't get that big play, but also lose the down, all because of a timeout."

Also I went on pro pack sprees of 10-20 mil using auto touchers( never for sniping) in search of mm, but obviously no luck. So in the end I lost about 390 mil. I can still see why you are asking about the 96 overall team and 36 level. That team is on my second main account becuz the old one is real slow on iPod touch. Also you have to notice that that team is THEME team of flashbacks and legends. I also gave away a lot. My current team is about 5 mil cost"

MaddenMobileForums,3dpznw,Syth1579,2,Sat Jul 18 10:21:47 2015 UTC,"I prefer Murray over Lynch. Murray has excellent speed, and varies between Agility and Strength trucking, which is why I sold my Bo Jackson originally. Honestly, if I wasn't building my All-Legends team, I'd easily go with Murray any day of the week, even over Bo."
MaddenMobileForums,3dpznw,BenjimanWa,3,Sat Jul 18 13:13:18 2015 UTC,I'd disagree. If I'm taking anyone get 98 or Fb faulk. But lynch is better than Murray. They have similar speed and everything else but lynch gets the edge with strength and trucking.
MaddenMobileForums,3dpznw,Syth1579,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I personally find Agility trucking much better, which is one of the key reasons why I don't like using Bo. Murray is also great for overall, 100 trucking, and when he can't truck over people with his limited strength, its always Agility, which I can't complain about because its much quicker. Head on, he can bowl over people too. I found Lynch to be too slow, as Murray had 99 speed for my with Kam, and I never saw his strength to be an issue."

MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,JimTom24,5,Sat Jul 18 06:31:03 2015 UTC,"Barry is more elusive. Bo is stronger. Both are superb. If you want to bowl people over, go Bo. If you want to shake them off, go Barry. Also, Bo is cheaper by a hefty margin."
MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,ZtheT,3,Sat Jul 18 12:34:52 2015 UTC,"Depends how you use your HB. If you pass to them a lot then Bo is easily the best. For pure running I'd say it's a toss up between Bo, Barry and AP.   AP easily has the best trucks of the 3 since he both Strength and Agility trucks. This means he can easily truck twice in a row and he seems to always choose the faster animation.  Bo is the best receiver and 100 spd means no one is catching him on a break away. Personally I like Bo (Legend or MM) at FB so I can pass to him.  Barry is the most elusive. Plays like a better Jamaal Charles IMO. A bit faster to get around the outside. That little bit can be the difference on a play like HB Lead Toss for 2 pts though."
MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Sat Jul 18 16:29:07 2015 UTC,Who would you say plays the most like Murray?

MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,TheRealFluffy0ne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:37 2015 UTC,Are you supposed to truck with Murray?
MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,skinsballr,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:26 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Murray is a hybrid truck like AP. So he can truck twice in a row and seems to usually automatically pick the faster truck for whatever the situation is.  With guys that only use one type of truck you kind of have to pick and choose when you truck or you risk getting a slow animation. With Murray and AP just always swipe up to truck =)

MaddenMobileForums,3dppz7,C0812,2,Sat Jul 18 22:12:14 2015 UTC,Oh lol yea try trucking. Murray has one of the best trucks in the game.   Juke is good for squeezing through gaps in the oline.   Spin move I would probably never use with Murray. For guys who only strength or agility truck spin move is your second move after trucking.

MaddenMobileForums,3dox1h,AgentAnteater,6,Sat Jul 18 02:08:58 2015 UTC,Damn. Well at least u can't post an auction for 150 mill ;)
MaddenMobileForums,3dox1h,theskyhooker,2,Sat Jul 18 02:13:56 2015 UTC,Yah. I just want any of them.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,InlandYears,6,Fri Jul 17 14:54:04 2015 UTC,I fear I'll never make it.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,TheNeek,3,Fri Jul 17 16:29:58 2015 UTC,right there with you
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,ghd1353,6,Fri Jul 17 17:37:41 2015 UTC,Congrats. I'm at 19/20 with 119 dupes and counting.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,DrKoooolAid,3,Fri Jul 17 16:01:31 2015 UTC,Woot! Congrats! I got him last week.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,ZtheT,3,Fri Jul 17 15:08:02 2015 UTC,Congrats.  Just in time for the reset.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,jphilipg,3,Fri Jul 17 16:52:35 2015 UTC,I've been stuck with 10/10 offense and 9/10 defense on the Gauntlet for at least four months. I just can NOT pull Under Smoke. I swear EA is doing it on purpose.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,OwenLeaf,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"Don't worry man, you'll get it soon. I thought the same thing until I finally pulled Double Slants a few days ago to finish it."

MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,traviso17,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:27 2015 UTC,how much did he improve your team?
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,Bvitamins1,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"I think each individual OVR (i.e. OFF, DEF and S/T) goes up by 1 each. Which in turn causes your team OVR to go up by 1."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:17 2015 UTC,I actually just got him this morning too. I went from 103-103-101 up to 105-104-103. Pretty sweet.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,ForgetISaidAnything,2,Fri Jul 17 20:50:07 2015 UTC,Surprisingly not much! Went from 100/101/101 to 101/103/103 ?!?!??!  I think I got some suckas dragging me down eg: Aaron Donald 98
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,livinlifeontheedge,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:55 2015 UTC,Goo job! I quick sold ask of my non-auctionable cards so that I didn't get hooked on the game again before it resets
MaddenMobileForums,3dmp11,imperfectPK,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:26 2015 UTC,I have gotten Oklahoma Offence 4 times on Wednesday and Friday. I'm at 10/10 Offence 9/10 Defence.

MaddenMobileForums,3dndqj,OwenLeaf,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:14 2015 UTC,i have needed the Mississippi rush for like 2 months now
MaddenMobileForums,3dndqj,Syth1579,2,Fri Jul 17 18:41:58 2015 UTC,Same with me and Under Smoke.
MaddenMobileForums,3dndqj,ZtheT,2,Sat Jul 18 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"I've needed the Cover 2 for the longest time now, and every single Gauntlet pack teases me with either to defense, or a Cover 3."

MaddenMobileForums,3dorv2,dave85257,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"I am saving up for him. Hes my next player, funny you'd say that. I got 500k and my word I will pay you over time lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3dorv2,dave85257,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:44 2015 UTC,Oops he's on the market rn for 1.2 mil
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,11,Fri Jul 17 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"It will be nice to restart again, the fun is gone when you are past 100 OVR IMO."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,samcrowell,4,Fri Jul 17 13:18:28 2015 UTC,I can't upgrade for less than at least $2M.. It sucks.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,StanleyTheBugman,11,Fri Jul 17 17:51:50 2015 UTC,I can't wait for the reset!! A brand new game with a brand new season. Im pumped
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,Bvitamins1,3,Fri Jul 17 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the prices of everything will skyrocket from August 9 through August 12 but it makes me wonder what anyone will do with the coins they earn from their auctions on August 12."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,thatswhytheycallitsh,8,Fri Jul 17 11:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of stuff on day one will be posted for super cheap, because people will be afraid that if it does not get bought, they will get nothing. But by the 12th, what is left will be the really really overpriced expensive stuff."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:15 2015 UTC,It will be a frantic few days.  What's left after the 12th won't be worth anything. No one will be able to bid or buy. It'll be like standing at the vending machine with your lotto winnings but no where to put your money in.  The days leading up to Aug 9 will be bananas as people will be desperate for coins to get that last player they want. Opportunities will exist for those with money in hand.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,TheNeek,3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it will be interesting. I for one, if I have anyone to sell, will try not to get too greedy and get stuck. Going on a Pro Pack run with any coins I get from selling will only be worth anything if I either get the last stud I want. I mean, if I get the multi million dollar ones I have already, they are actually worthless to me. It's like, woo-hoo, got a second MM Jerry Rice. Oh, but wait, can't use him, can't sell him."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"yea, I'm keeping a clean house right now to keep my free cash high, which isn't much. Can you imagine pulling a MM Sanders from a pro pack after Aug 12? Would be depressingly funny. It'd be nice if you could donate such items to needy individuals who happen to love Star Wars as much as you do and are in your league. Can't think of anyone of hand, but I'm sure you could find a worthy player."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,TheNeek,3,Fri Jul 17 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to throw some players I pull in the end to my league mates. Shame if they just get evaporated on my bench."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I'm positive that would be the case."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,TheNeek,6,Fri Jul 17 18:58:46 2015 UTC,Or Quicksell them for 100 coins. Imagine that.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 18:59:49 2015 UTC,Turn trophies into mystery packs.  The humanity!
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,TheNeek,3,Fri Jul 17 21:25:20 2015 UTC,Those packs are worthless if you cannot use or sell what you get.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 21:49:19 2015 UTC,Packs will most likely be available until the last day.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,thatswhytheycallitsh,2,Fri Jul 17 11:34:31 2015 UTC,"Good point, I might wait to sell the countless gold players i have just for that. Hopefully there's more than just pro packs at that time though."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,apollonese,3,Fri Jul 17 11:41:31 2015 UTC,"wouldn't prices actually plummet because people would rather get SOME money, than NO money?"
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 12:39:19 2015 UTC,"I think you'll see both extremes. Some people will post their cards at really high prices, thinking they can dictate the market and force other people to comply. Others will post their cards at dirt cheap prices because they're afraid no one will purchase them otherwise."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,JackBauerNFL,3,Fri Jul 17 15:08:21 2015 UTC,This is what I expect as well. A lot of cards are monopolized so I think the only fair expectation is extreme fluctuation based on exactly that....1 group wanting to maximize their return...and the other wanting something rather then nothing.  All this should do is make some of us speed up the efforts of getting legacy lineups in place to avoid the final minute shenanigans that are sure to happen.
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Definitely. For this reason, I might start targeting more expensive players first, since they will rise in price the most towards the end. I'd rather spend 3 million on Webster than have to spend 5 million on Watt."
MaddenMobileForums,3dm2na,Stuchu,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:55 2015 UTC,I still haven't managed to get my items sold yet lol. I better start now
MaddenMobileForums,3dnbol,gkalldamday,4,Fri Jul 17 17:45:49 2015 UTC,He's a new FE so not many have dropped. His price will probably stay there for awhile unless Gridiron packs happen to come out.
MaddenMobileForums,3dnbol,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:46 2015 UTC,I figured that I could use him for my all bengals squad but I'm not going to spend 600k when the mvp green is 94 and gives plus two catch to my whole team
MaddenMobileForums,3dnbol,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:31 2015 UTC,Yea I'll probably pick him up for my all FE team but for all Bengals MVP is probably a better choice.
MaddenMobileForums,3dnbol,kwrocket,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:41 2015 UTC,same with FE Demariyus. I think it's relative scarcity v. PH players
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,bran861,6,Fri Jul 17 12:52:59 2015 UTC,"i found the secret. you need to swipe in the direction you want him to throw. EXAMPLE: when you are the TE and the box is right in front of you, run forward, then swipe down to cut back toward the QB, only THEN do you hit the ""pass"" button. he will throw in which ever direction you swiped. After discovering this, i did it all in one try."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,apollonese,2,Fri Jul 17 12:54:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, I was able to finish it after 5 tries."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,Bvitamins1,6,Fri Jul 17 13:03:10 2015 UTC,I did it by keeping my WR stationary in one spot then timing the throw to hit when the box was under him
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,InlandYears,4,Fri Jul 17 13:03:57 2015 UTC,Same here. I can't imagine what this would be like with an active defender though. Screw this mode!
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,OwenLeaf,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:50 2015 UTC,That's what I had to do as well.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,ccubs2015,3,Fri Jul 17 19:43:00 2015 UTC,The first three passes no problem. The last one. F that.  It's hard enough without defenders!
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,Reereez95,3,Fri Jul 17 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"Normally I abhor this mode for its insane difficulty, but today I completed it on my first try."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,ZtheT,4,Fri Jul 17 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"If I could hate it more, yes. But I already hated it a lot, like a really lot."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbjh,jsight,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:29 2015 UTC,I never did it before today.
MaddenMobileForums,3dla8e,justinjameswatt,3,Fri Jul 17 04:43:46 2015 UTC,How many do you have? Thats actually pretty impressive
MaddenMobileForums,3dla8e,westywall,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. I have 15
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,JackBauerNFL,4,Fri Jul 17 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"Team sets are easy to fill out and net you some profit along the way.  Do one season picking up as many achievements as you can along the way, and then forfeit your way through the rest of the seasons. After 9 or so games it lets you skip to the next season, and you still get the credit for completing a season in your season score."
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,onbehalfofreddit,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent tip. Thanks for sharing that, I had never even thought of forfeiting.  Team sets are key but even just doing those will get you in the 50-60% range.  MVP's and PH sets are important. Especially now with some pretty cheap MVP sets to be completed."
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:08 2015 UTC,This right here... this is genius...
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"I wish I had a system on how to get 100% season score, but I honestly don't. As soon as they released the Season Score calculator, I was already at 100%. This is after filling out A LOT of sets and reaching a team OVR of 100. I've also accomplished all but 7 of the possible achievements (which is to be expected from someone who has played the game since August of 2014).  I will post a photo of what my Season Score looks like broken down. Hopefully this will help.  [EDIT]: Oddly enough, I've found that doing live events help to increase my Season Score on Alt Accounts. Just an FYI. It's only by 1 or 2% every so often, but it's helpful."
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,Klozkoth,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:03 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Like many here I also hit 100% on my 'main' team the minute we had the Season Score released.  But I think like many I am also trying to finish another 100% SS for secondary teams and don't want to waste time where I don't have to.
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,Hunter8258,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:25 2015 UTC,Get through as many seasons as possible. Losing seasons count as well.
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"I did this:   Hit 99 overall for offense and defense and 90 for special teams It's 2% per h2h tier so try and hit like 1 million fans.  It only took me 2 days Achievements.  Do all the easy h2h and season achievements.  You can get a bunch done in like 2 or 3 season games. Sets.  The team sets and positional upgrade sets are both cheap, and you don't lose much money on the positional upgrade sets.   That's what I did.  I've only completed one season but I still have 100% season score.  It worked for me and might work for you too.  Edit: And obviously your level will also go up as you do live events and h2h, further helping your season score."
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,TheRealFluffy0ne,3,Fri Jul 17 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"Re: Achievements I recently realized that starting a league with 1 team and using it to gain achievements helps.   Using a 'dummy' team that never leaves the league you can always add a new team and win a game getting an 80yard rushing, 80 yard recieving, kick off return, or 50 yard FG and gain numerous achievements and 10K and once game 1 ends you become #1 in the league and get another achievement.   Start game 2 and get the 1 achievement you missed in game 1 and you've quickly finished 6 or 7 achievements."
MaddenMobileForums,3dn00a,EK22,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"Bush league move, but you can always lower your team OVR as you move up in H2H tier. This will pit you against weaker opponents.  A dick move in general, but if you're trying to upgrade an alt account last minute, it's effective."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbac,ZtheT,10,Fri Jul 17 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"Lmao!! The way you said that was too funny. lol  I found these events to be fun and different at first. Now? They're rather annoying and discouraging. On the other hand, it is a sign that EA is moving in the right direction. They're trying to make the game less basic and more interactive."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbac,Reereez95,6,Fri Jul 17 15:05:30 2015 UTC,It's just a bit wonky trying to control him.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbac,Reereez95,5,Fri Jul 17 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the mechanics of it all could be a lot better. That's one area EA needs to improve events like that. I imagine we could see stuff like this next season where we're also the DB or the LB, sort of like the Gauntlet for Madden 15 (where you practice different skills)."

MaddenMobileForums,3dmbi1,apollonese,3,Fri Jul 17 12:52:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Faulk is going to put a dent in it for you. The guys that likely would are super expensive, pretty much MMs. Fitz, Rice, Largent, Winslow, Brady, Sanders, etc.. I'd say MM Brady and MM Bo are obtainable with some work on your coins."
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbi1,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 13:05:43 2015 UTC,yeah i was kinda thinking MM brady. Thanks man - that helps.
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbi1,Reereez95,3,Fri Jul 17 13:07:12 2015 UTC,"Here are some options to upgrade your offensive OVR. There is no particular order as to which option would be best. I just numbered them so you would know how many I think there are:  (1) Sell Legend Bo and make a serious push to get MM Bo Jackson.  This option has the best potential award but is also the most unrealistic. If you are confident in your ability to make coins, then go for it. Bo can sell for about 1.5 mil BIN when Legend Packs aren't around. That would still only leave you at 2.45 million coins, and MM Bo costs at least 5 to 6 mil. Get cracking!  (2) Upgrade from PH Wilson to MM Brady.  This is one of the more realistic options. Brady falls below 1 mil during Legend Packs. He contributes WAY more to overall than Wilson does. But this decision is based largely on preference. If you want the most accurate passer in the game and a higher OVR, go for Brady. But if you prefer a mobile QB who has good accuracy, then you should stick with Wilson.   (3) Sell Ricky Wagner and get Dan Dierdorf.  The other more realistic option is to upgrade your tackle spot. Wagner is good, but Dierdorf is better (statistically and for OVR). He's also pretty cheap, going for as low as 1.2 mil on the AH (usually during Legend Packs). The only thing that makes this upgrade worth it is Dierdorf's better contributions to OVR.   (4) Sell DeMarco Murray and purchase a better HB flex.  This was your idea from the start. It could work, and it's far more realistic than selling Bo and trying to get his MM counterpart. You could sell Murray and go for Lacy, but I don't know if that would bump up your OVR. Before the introduction of MM Barry and Bo, the best combination for OVR was Legend Bo as the HB and MM AP as the flex. This could work out, although you'll have to save up about 3 - 3.5 million coins to do it (this is as low as I've seen his prices drop during Legend packs). MM Barry is out of the question, unless you happen to snipe his card in the AH. He's too rare and too expensive.  (5) Sell Mike Ditka and purchase Kellen Winslow Sr. for the slot.  This is probably as realistic as getting AP for the flex position. MM Kellen Winslow has fallen as low as 3.3 million before (during Legend Packs), but the question is how much does he improve your OVR. If you were choosing between this option and getting Peterson for the HB flex, I would go with AP.  (6) Sell MM Megatron and go for either FE Antonio Brown or MM Largent/Fitzgerald.  Obviously the most realistic target here is FE Antonio Brown. Brown (97.67) is 4th among all 99 WRs for team OVR, while Megatron (96) is only 9th. This could realistically improve your team OVR. Another option is to take the money from selling Megatron and going for either MM Fitz or MM Largent. I haven't seen Largent enough to know what his prices are like, but I know Fitz goes for around 5 million at least (even during Legend Packs). So saving up for Fitz would be like saving up for MM Bo. It could be worth it, but only if you trust your ability to make enough coins.  These are all my ideas for how to improve your offensive OVR. Everything else on your team looks good. Your strongest positions are TE, WR 1 and every O-line position except for RT. It's unrealistic to think you can upgrade Upshaw to Allen (6 million in the AH), so I didn't list that as an option. Hopefully this was helpful for you. Use those coins wisely! You have plenty of options. It's up to you which one you should follow before the reset.  Good luck!"
MaddenMobileForums,3dmbi1,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much man, what an awesome response - this is an awesome guide!  I'm still deciding and am closer to around 1.5 million now - I'm going to either go for brady, but dierdorf is a good option too, and one i hadn't thought of. Brown is a good thought too - thanks again, super helpful!"

MaddenMobileForums,3dmbi1,jonnytranftw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:06:16 2015 UTC,Rg3 would help the ovr as well. he also plays similar to ph wilson.

MaddenMobileForums,3dk7hw,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 17 00:03:11 2015 UTC,Is he actually selling for over a mil or are those just overpriced ones people want to sell? He was in the 500k range a couple of weeks ago.
MaddenMobileForums,3dk7hw,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 16 23:15:59 2015 UTC,Don't know. Those were the only ones on the market

MaddenMobileForums,3dk7hw,OwenLeaf,3,Thu Jul 16 23:44:44 2015 UTC,I thought so. Gonna try him out before selling but I don't I'll keep him. I hate Brady as a human but he's so damn good in this game.

MaddenMobileForums,3dk34j,GiveMeSomeIhedigbo,4,Fri Jul 17 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"I think I saw that stat somewhere too. I know people question whether he'll do much when Peyton retires, but I think he'll still be a stud. IMO, Manning's presence on the team has helped DT mature and improve his game (beyond just providing him with a reliable QB).  Though it was a beat down, that Super Bowl match-up was fun to look forward to."
MaddenMobileForums,3dk34j,Reereez95,3,Thu Jul 16 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"First Super-Bowl I have seen (In the country I live in kids are more influenced to watch soccer then American football) and I had a blast (I became a seahawks fan in the begining of that season) I think he will be a stud too, not as great as dez, but a stud I believe that without him, Peyton would need to do more for the team, and I believe he would expose himself, cause of his age and injuries Is true that he still has two good wr in Wes and Emmanuel, but I believe that Demaryus is the guy, that helps him out the most"
MaddenMobileForums,3dk34j,Reereez95,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"Sanders certainly helps. Wes is no longer on the team, but even if he was his injuries would keep him off the field.  I agree too that Dez seems better than Demaryius. He has that extra ""it"" factor that can't be explained. Demaryius does rack up a shit ton of receiving yards though."
MaddenMobileForums,3djgls,fair_in_height,5,Thu Jul 16 19:36:11 2015 UTC,Cool idea. Not sure why you got downvoted. Maybe because it's not directly related to Madden.  Would be interesting to see some performance studies from players who have tried this vs other that haven't.

MaddenMobileForums,3djh55,Orangeskill,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:05 2015 UTC,If that's really what you want to do. Sell Buchanon and you two elite offensive lineman. That should net you decent coin
MaddenMobileForums,3djh55,Orangeskill,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:16 2015 UTC,Yea but who could i replace them with that would still be effective?
MaddenMobileForums,3djh55,DannyBenavidez,2,Fri Jul 17 02:06:51 2015 UTC,You could replace ur Buchanon with the rising stars buchannon. You'd get an extra +3 percent  xp too. For about 25 k. But it's definitely a downgrade. And there are some affordable 86-88 guards that cost less than 20 k too
MaddenMobileForums,3djh55,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 17 03:34:50 2015 UTC,"I really like Tevin Coleman as RB and Melvin Gordon in the flex position. Melvin Gordon is really great when using PA TE Drag, PA TE Corner and PA Streaks."
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,Syth1579,3,Thu Jul 16 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"I think TEs in the flex are better for OVR, but WRs perform better in the flex. If you want someone who can block in the slot (in addition to pass catching), then you should go with a TE.   Run blocking ability from the flex position is underrated."
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,Reereez95,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love having my Ditka in the flex. But, according to the spreadsheet, MM VJax should technically be better for overall than Kellen Winslow is, but in game, when people tried this, it is shown to be not true."
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,Reereez95,3,Thu Jul 16 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the Spreadsheet is wrong. Even though it follows EA's formula, there seem to be exceptions to EA's rules."
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,ZtheT,3,Thu Jul 16 19:41:52 2015 UTC,Thats exactly it. I guess the Flex is just a lost cause for now.
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,Reereez95,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"It depends. Largent was great in the slot because he is quick. But he's an awful blocker, but also not tall and strong. He either got ahead of the defender, or likely did not catch it. I feel like with Winslow he can have three guys on him and he'll still usually catch it. Though he is less likely to break away once he catches the ball."
MaddenMobileForums,3djcrk,kwrocket,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the nice thing about Winslow is that he's a wide receiver in a tight end's body. He's got excellent height, speed and catching ability paired with decent blocking stats. He's a threat in the pass and run game."

MaddenMobileForums,3dkvld,ZtheT,3,Fri Jul 17 17:29:19 2015 UTC,yea the plan right now is to just squirrel away coins till the end of the month unless I see a good deal. We'll see if panic starts to set in come august to drive market prices down...
MaddenMobileForums,3dkvld,TheRealFluffy0ne,3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:30 2015 UTC,"I am sure it will, but rare guys like Rice and VJax are less likely to come down much. It's only a matter of at what price point people are ready to pounce. My guess is there are a lot of people that would still pounce on Rice for 20 mil and VJax for 15 mil."
MaddenMobileForums,3dkvld,ZtheT,3,Fri Jul 17 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think VJax will probably drop lower than 15. I don't see Rice getting below 20 though."

MaddenMobileForums,3dk9d4,gimpisgawd,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:36 2015 UTC,You typically don't make very much selling packs. Especially TOTY. The only people who buy them are the ones too lazy to make guest accounts to gift them to themselves. 10-20k profit after AH fees is probably the most you'll see.

But, I think at this point they know many people don't care much about madden anymore and are just ready for the new season, and they've probably focused more of their efforts towards making a new season (this may be unlikely but at least it's a possibility).   They're basically tanking everything until next season, done with MM, packs are all f***ed up, and they probably know there's a small population left in the game.  Again, I'm not trying to back up ea, their servers are trash anyway and their support for games have always been terrible (for me and I assume many more), but I think they've lost interest in ""trying"" to keep the game popular and stable, until next season...

MaddenMobileForums,3dgvne,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"As DeadToWrites said in the original post releasing the spreadsheet, we don't know. But as far as we know, a 99 HB/FB could be static, meaning Bo may have a 96.86 overall, but Barry may have 95 in the flex, or Barry may have 96.68 and Marshall Faulk may have 95, if that makes any sense. But, throwing in a lower than 99 may have a lower static overall is what I'm assuming it is."
MaddenMobileForums,3dgvne,Jorvorskie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  A few notes that I've been meaning to add:   Check your TE evaluations, as I believe you forgot to sum the entire line, i.e., PBK is not being added. Also when evaluating the flex as a TE, MM VJax should be second, but MM Winslow is still best for OVR in the flex when using Gronk as TE (from my own testing). I'm pretty sure one of the attributes is wrong for SR Sanders.  It's not a big difference, but it makes him drop down a notch."
MaddenMobileForums,3dgvne,kwrocket,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Fixed the TE evaluations, and corrected SR Sander's awareness. As for TEs, this probably disproves the way that flex grades players. Now we will never know."

NTL again. Their PLR, MAN and ZON are pretty similar (as well as most base physical attributes), but NTL's better STR, TKL, and HTP give him an edge."
MaddenMobileForums,3dg667,Reereez95,5,Thu Jul 16 05:12:48 2015 UTC,"They look pretty close there, but NTL has the edge in Play Rec and hit power.  Anyone who's had both, how do they compare in game?"
MaddenMobileForums,3dg667,DeadToWrites,3,Thu Jul 16 01:57:14 2015 UTC,"Awareness is off because he has dom sherman and i have GC jon ryan, and i have +5 strength and + 1 agility but those dont affect who has the higher stat. Just thought this was interesting"
MaddenMobileForums,3dg667,Reereez95,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the comparison via the Mobile Players Database on MUThead:  http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/6285/6144  As you can see, they are pretty similar in many statistics. But like every player in the game, there are noticeable differences:    NTL has superior strength to Sherman (+7 better STR) NTL also has far superior catching ability (+7 better CAT) As far as all-around offensive skills go, NTL is more dominant than MM Sherman. NTL is far more elusive (+7 ELU), has much better vision (+10 BCV) and much better catch in traffic (+14 CIT). The only notable offensive stat Sherman dominates in is carrying (+12 CAR). So NTL has a better chance of fumbling interception returns. Richard Sherman has very weak pursuit (88) compared to NTL (97). This I found rather surprising. Both are really close in MAN, ZON and PLR. In my opinion, the differences are almost negligible. Sherman (100 PRS) has much better press ability than NTL (95 PRS). This is also why Sherman has better MAN and NTL has better ZON. This is where NTL takes the cake. He has 94 TKL (+10 better) and 100 HTP (+18 better). Those are insane stats for a corner.   If I was choosing between the two, I would obviously pick MM NTL over MM Sherman. It's interesting that EA gave Sherman the best MAN defense in the game, considering he plays largely in a Cover 3 defense. They could have given NTL and Sherman equal MAN and ZON, but then given Sherman the better PRS ability. That would have made more sense in my mind.  Either way, both corners are excellent and clearly top tier in this game. MM Sherman is a great alternative to Domination Sherman, and MM NTL is worth almost any price."

MaddenMobileForums,3dfwh5,xKizume,2,Thu Jul 16 00:28:37 2015 UTC,Damn nice. I just turned all my gold players from Legend Packs into trophies and got 200k and 50k back to back. Almost refunded from the packs lol.
MaddenMobileForums,3dfwh5,xKizume,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"Not even kidding, I started today with 300 coins. From selling Murray, I had 377, bought a totw Charles as a replacement. Dropped the rest into trophies for LQS, got Bo. Took the rest of it, did LQS, and got shit all. After that, I had just enough to but a TOTY and some Pro Packs, did that, sold elites, did it again, then turned players into trophies, did the LQS, so today, I got a Bo, again, and now have 580k coins."
MaddenMobileForums,3dfwh5,bran861,3,Thu Jul 16 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"That's crazy how one 99 player can start a chain of income! I've done the LQS around 30 times, and so far my lucky has been fairly bad. The highest I got was that 200k a while ago. If you can make some more, I'd settle for MM Bo. I'm not sure what his price was but I think on the first day of legends he was floating at the ~6 million mark. His price probably spiked back up though, but that is a crazy chain of events you had there."
MaddenMobileForums,3dfwh5,UffaloIlls,2,Thu Jul 16 02:14:16 2015 UTC,"He's around 7 Million now. I decided to sell my Brett Kern punter, my Jack Lambert and get a MM Lambert, then quit for today. I don't think I should be pushing my luck any further than what I have lol. I'm at a 106 offense now with Ryan thanks to Bo. I wasn't before when I had Murray, so hopefully Lambert would shoot my to a 106 defense!  EDIT: I've done the LQS 306 times now. I think it was my 273rd I got the million on."
MaddenMobileForums,3dfpj1,ZtheT,6,Wed Jul 15 22:25:32 2015 UTC,That many coins is worth about $500 real money
MaddenMobileForums,3dfpj1,Vancebaer,7,Wed Jul 15 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely shocked that anyone would be willing to spend $500 on a virtual player when said player will be gone in a little more than 4 weeks.  Even the ""it's entertainment"" justification is not enough. With $500 you could purchase a PS4 or Xbox One plus a couple of games. You could purchase 8 new games if you already have a next gen system (assuming they're all around $60 apiece). Similarly, you could afford Xbox live for 8 years with $500. You could buy a nice, flat screen TV with that kind of money (not the best available, but something good). Hell, you could probably buy 3 small flat screen TVs with $500. I just saw a cheap (meaning quality) 4-wheeler online for $500. And of course you could use $500 for more practical things, such as groceries and bills...  My point is that it's ridiculous for people to be spending this kind of money on coins! It's none of my business what someone else does with their money, but I think everyone needs to take a Personal Accounting course at a community college nearby. I understand the addiction Madden creates, but there are better alternatives than wasting your money on a mobile game.  And I have experience with this: when I was young, I wasted $50 worth of iTunes money on refilling my energy in Mafia Wars. Not a fun experience. I vowed never to spend money on IAPs ever again!  ... and I've completely forgotten why I started typing this in first place. It's been a long day at work, so I think I'll pack up and go now."
MaddenMobileForums,3dfpj1,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 15 23:37:03 2015 UTC,Or they got the coins from the hack a while back. I'm sure there's someone with 1 billion left still.
MaddenMobileForums,3dfpj1,Whoahbro,2,Thu Jul 16 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"That's true. I wasn't trying to make a blanket statement about guys who have a lot of coins. There are people who built there coins up and there are also people who have scammed others out of their coins. My comment was in reference to people who are willing to spend money within video games (i.e. IAPs). Specifically, anyone who is willing to pay $500 for 50 million coins.  Especially when you consider the impending reset and how cheap coins used to be, it is not worth it to buy coins at this point in the game. But to each their own."

MaddenMobileForums,3dexon,Syth1579,4,Wed Jul 15 19:17:44 2015 UTC,11 million-ish. Sadly I started the process and bought most of the players before Legend packs dropped last time around. So I overpaid on a few players.
MaddenMobileForums,3dexon,Syth1579,3,Wed Jul 15 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"Which cost the most? Bo, NTL and Sweetness being the obvious ones, along with Allen"
MaddenMobileForums,3dexon,Syth1579,3,Wed Jul 15 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"I already owned Bo. NTL was 2mil, Sweetness 900k, Larry Allen 800k. Pace and Munoz were around 400 or 500k each but I rarely saw Pace the couple days it took me to build the team. I bet you could do it for the same price if not cheaper with some patience."
MaddenMobileForums,3dexon,BenjimanWa,2,Wed Jul 15 20:30:43 2015 UTC,Patience AND if you attack when the market is flooded with legends post legend packs.

(You're bound to get something). You can't really buy a better player for your roster with 100k only.

MaddenMobileForums,3dj24r,Austin1234bro,6,Thu Jul 16 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of days left before the reset and plenty of threads that give advice on coins. You will be hard-pressed to find anyone who is willing to just hand out coins in any form other than a giveaway.   Here are some links to threads in this subreddit on how to make coins:   Money Making 101 - courtesy of /u/Syth1579 Sniping Strategy - courtesy of /u/dubsallday ""How To"" Guide for Sniping - courtesy of /u/UffaloIlls   These are the most recent advice threads on how to make some coins, primarily via sniping. You can also find other helpful guides in the ""Tips and Guides"" section of this subreddit, which can be found on the sidebar on the right side of your computer screen.   I also have my own advice for efficient coin making, but because I'd like to still make coins, you will have to PM me for this advice. (I'm pretty sure others are aware of it, but I'd like to keep it off of threads and public forums)  There's also a spreadsheet for Best Players for OVR at each position, courtesy of /u/DeadToWrites. This can also be found on the sidebar. I'm also providing a link to a recent discussion about best value Mobile Masters cards. This thread doesn't provide any tips or go into a lot of depth, but it does mention some cheaper 99 OVR players that can be good for your team.  Hopefully this is helpful for you. Not many people are willing to just hand out coins on this subreddit, and I don't blame them. There have been scammers who took advantage of people and gyped them out of millions of coins. And considering the rise in value for selling coins ($5 - $10 per million coins), you'll be hard-pressed to receive a handout. Giveaways are probably your best shot.  Use the links provided to try and build up as many coins as you possibly can before the reset. Hopefully you can get the players you want most. Don't forget to PM me if you want some coin making tips (the only thing I ask is that you don't share it on a public forum or with other people).   Good luck!"
MaddenMobileForums,3dj24r,Reereez95,3,Thu Jul 16 18:45:00 2015 UTC,Why the hell are prices rising?
MaddenMobileForums,3dj24r,KSearle21,3,Thu Jul 16 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"I have no answer for that question. I can't even fathom the idea of spending real money on virtual currency. I blew $50 on IAPs in Mafia Wars when I was younger, so I vowed to never spend a cent on anything virtual (aside from purchasing the actual game).   The prices are something I picked up on from another thread. I thought I'd just share that information here as support for why people won't do charity in Madden Mobile. Considering the game is resetting in about 4 weeks, I think it's pretty stupid that coin prices are rising and that people are actually buying them."

MaddenMobileForums,3denny,somuchyumyumyum,4,Wed Jul 15 17:59:37 2015 UTC,MM Bruce. Used to be the best for overall. He's super cheap and he plays pretty good.  MM Vick is beast too.
MaddenMobileForums,3denny,UffaloIlls,3,Wed Jul 15 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"MM Vick is still my favorite to use. Vick isn't great for overall, but he's the fastest QB in the game with a cannon arm and deep ball accuracy. Those are my favorite plays to exploit people with, so his gameplay makes me really happy. Bought him for 200k a while back.  I wouldn't mention him if his prices weren't dropping, but MM Gronk has been really great too. He is far more affordable now (1 - 1.2 mil during legend packs) than he used to be (started at 3 mil when released). He's the best TE in the game. His pass catching ability is uncanny, his tenacity to fight for yards is unheard of and his blocking ability is underrated. Not much more needs to be said about him. I picked him up a week ago for 1 million coins.  /u/Marauder93 just reminded me about MM Ed Reed. Best safety in the game for under 900k? Yes please."
MaddenMobileForums,3denny,Reereez95,3,Wed Jul 15 18:10:12 2015 UTC,vick is a real budget beast. cant argue with 99 speed

I have about 28 mil atm, slowly making upgrades, but I sorta ha e a plan laid out for the team so I kinda have a budget on how much I'm willing to drop on a qb (having wilson, 98 young, sb brady, h rodgers alreqdy).

He's great."
MaddenMobileForums,3denny,theskyhooker,3,Wed Jul 15 22:30:06 2015 UTC,MM Lynch and MM Calvin Johnson are beasts that you can get for under 500k. You can also get MM Cromartie and MM Reed for under 900k now too - they were both over the million mark not so long ago.

Then you have to upgrade your HB. Get someone like 96 Alfred Morris for under 100k. Then, get Kam Chancellor, and make sure to do it today or Friday. He's always cheaper on Gauntlet days. You should be able to find him for about 200k. He's a nice 99 with a speed boost to your whole team."

Boosting aside, those players are not that good and they are at important positions. I would replace them if you could. Then, GC Jon Ryan would matter, and as a punter his not being so great at it doesn't really matter."
MaddenMobileForums,3de5ta,footballdude8686,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's a good point. Alright, I'll switch over to GC Ryan and go about replacing the rookies."

MaddenMobileForums,3de5ta,Reereez95,3,Wed Jul 15 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"TOTW Edelman is under 40k and is an easy upgrade over Kelvin. After that, I'd probably cheaply upgrade your LBs. FO Lavonte David (93 SPD!!) can be had for 60k or less. Both Edelman and David are only 96s, but I suspect on your team they'll easily be boosted to 98 (they do on mine).  Demarcus Ware and your backs should probably be next, but they're going to be a bit pricier. Maybe TOTY Calais Campbell (96 overall) for $50k?   And I agree with the other guys regarding Jon Ryan."

Examining the AH and there are some odd trends occurring (i.e. MM Lott is far less expensive than Legend Lott). My advice will include your most pressing needs, realistic players to afford, and an ideal line-up you should look to create before the reset.   I'm not sure how you made your coins, but if you would like advice on that too, just PM me. For now, I'm still unavailable to provide advice (I'm also at work, so that's my top priority right now)."

MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,ha876,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"Who else do you have along your O-line? Just asking for perspective.  [EDIT]: Without further O-line information, I would side with Webster. Even with further O-line information, I'd go with Webster. He's the best center in the game and (if I'm not mistaken) the 8th or 9th best player for team OVR.   Upshaw has dropped in price lately (when Legend Packs are out), so you might be able to afford both if you save up 500k - 700k more coins. Wait until Legend Packs to buy either player."
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,Reereez95,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:00:57 2015 UTC,Right now my OL is:    PH Thomas PH Sitton MVP Kory TOTY Boling PH Wagner
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you made your coins (or how easy it would be to make more), but here's some advice for the rest of your O-line:  In a perfect world, your starting line-up along the O-line would be Munoz, Allen, Webster, Long and Thomas. This is not an ideal world, and my goal is to provide you with advice on what you should do to realistically improve your line.  At 3.5 million coins, you will only be able to afford Webster or Upshaw (not both). However, if you time your purchase right, you may be able to save enough coins to purchase the other in the future. Webster went for 1.5 mil coins for the longest time. Now that his card has become more rare to pull, his price has risen to a stable 2.5 million coins (on average). Assuming you would like both players at one point, Webster is not the guy you should target first (although you should keep your eye on him in case his price does drop because of legend packs).   Upshaw is who you want to target first. Why? Legend packs have forced his prices down to ~ 2 million coins. This is a really good bargain for a player that sits around 2.5 - 3 million during the week. Looking at who you have on your O-line currently, TOTY Boling is your weakest link. He's a pretty damn good weak link, but Kory Lichtensteiger is a better player to keep on the O-line.   If you can get Upshaw at ~ 2 million coins, then you would have 1.5 mil left over. Then you'd save up your coins and purchase Webster when legend packs return (doesn't vastly affect his price, but it's better than weekday prices).   Here are the players I think you should target for your offensive line:   Mike Webster - 2.2 mil Kyle Long - 800k Gene Upshaw - 2 mil Dan Dierdorf - 1.7 mil   How realistic this is depends on how fast you can make a lot of coins. Next to each player I listed the lowest prices I've seen in the last 2 weeks during legend packs. In total, you'd need to accumulate 6.5 million coins to afford these players.   Though you said Upshaw and Webster were your top priorities, here is how I would approach upgrading your O-line:   I would start by purchasing PH Kyle Long. He is the best OG in the game. Replace PH Sitton with PH Long. Then sell Sitton (@ 600k), Boling (@ 80k) and Lichtensteiger (@ 230k). You should then have about 3.5 million coins (what you started with). I would then proceed to purchase Upshaw during legend packs. When I had enough to get Webster, I would then buy him during legend packs.   This would give you an O-line of Thomas, Long, Webster, Upshaw and Wagner. Dierdorf is left on the chopping block because of PH Wagner. If you were ever able to make 1.7 million more coins, my recommendation would be to purchase Dan Dierdorf and sell Wagner. Wagner's current AH prices are too high, so I don't know what you could sell him for. But whoever you do choose to sell along your O-line, never sell them during legend packs.  Hopefully this was helpful! Good luck on upgrading your team!"
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,Reereez95,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:47:51 2015 UTC,Awesome advice. Thanks. I'm definitely waiting for LPs before buying anything.  I still have some cards I need to sell. Could probably make another 3 million. The rest of my team is where I want it. Now I'm just focusing on getting the best OL I can before the reset.
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,ZtheT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:27 2015 UTC,"That would definitely be Kyle Long. In order of best O-linemen you can afford:  (1) Kyle Long  (2) Mike Webster  (3) Gene Upshaw  (4) Dan Dierdorf  Kyle Long is easily affordable. If you go for Webster afterwards (which you should still have enough coins leftover), you will have an all-99 offensive line. You could still go for Upshaw or Dierdorf afterwards (assuming you can make bank off of Boling, Lichtensteiger and Sitton/Wagner) if you want to."
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 16 04:34:19 2015 UTC,Webster no question. He's the GOAT. But you'll need to build your coins to get him.
MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,soenottelling,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:33:39 2015 UTC,I've seen quite a few Websters under 3 million.

MaddenMobileForums,3deicw,lgmthbass,2,Wed Jul 15 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"Long>Upshaw and costs a fraction of the price btw.  I would go with Webster and then just get long.  Upshaw is an upgrade over sitton, but if we are just talking rg then make long for around 700k by buying the collectibles and buy webster."

New Seahawks fans should really read up on him, he won the DPOY and pretty much singlehandedly prevented Seattle from going 0-fer in 1991 or 1992, don't remember the year off the top of my head. He was hands down one of the best interior D-Linemen of that era.  A Nagurski card would be an amazing bruising runner, his UL card could have like a 103 trucking or something ridiculous like that."
MaddenMobileForums,3dbi09,pat3488,3,Wed Jul 15 18:25:27 2015 UTC,92' with 14 sacks. Played with the Seahawks for 9 years easily one of the best d-linemen of all time.

MaddenMobileForums,3dbi09,theskyhooker,3,Thu Jul 16 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"Joe Theismann doesn't deserve a Legend card.  He was a decent quarterback operating behind the best O-line in NFL history (Hogs) with one of the better receiving cores of all time (Fun Bunch).  There's a reason he's not a HoFer.  I would prefer instead if the Legend card went to John Riggins.  There aren't enough good power runners in the game.  All the legend HBs are speedy, agile players, and I think Riggins would do well.  Riggins won the SB for the Redskins."
MaddenMobileForums,3dbi09,rbulls,3,Wed Jul 15 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Let's face it, most people only know Theismann because of his hideous injury. There's no doubt he was a serviceable QB, definitely above average, but he was hardly legendary.  Riggins would be a great power runner in the mold of Franco Harris's existing cards."
MaddenMobileForums,3dbi09,theskyhooker,3,Wed Jul 15 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally I mainly remember Theismann for his strip on Bokamper.  I would give anything for a Riggins legend/MM/SB card or whatever, though.  Or really anybody else from that era.  Art Monk, Dave Butz, Dexter Manley, Charles Mann, any of the Hogs, especially Darrell Green.  The Redskins never really had a great QB during that time."

MaddenMobileForums,3daclf,bulldog1602,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"I thought lots of people knew this trick but here it goes: select a normal punt return play and highlight the innermost DB covering the shot guy on the side opposite of the extra up back. Pull him so he's off the edge of the DE and rush the punter. If you have a decently fast DB in that position, 9/10 times you can tackle the punter(no flags obviously) or block it. I'll post a screenshot in a second, in case my description was shit. Anyways, it results on the punter being down by contact and you get the ball where he was standing. Also can potentially work as a safety.  Edit: Took some shots. If it's not working, consider getting a faster dime and nickel and/or really set that angle. Might take practice but it works nearly every play for me!   http://imgur.com/mS9uyeN maybe set him a little closer to the line just enough so you get past the guard untouched  http://imgur.com/NptgH5Z Results!"

MaddenMobileForums,3d9ymi,Reereez95,4,Tue Jul 14 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"I would just like to comment and say that this is why EA added the recent ""easy mode"" setting. With the vast disparity between people with a lot of coins and people with no coins (as well as the disparity between people who are knowledgeable of the game and people who are new to the game), EA needed a way to even the playing field. This is how they chose to do it.  I doubt it carries over and I'm not justifying Madden Mobile's recent update. But with the way people are freaking out in the comments section of this thread, it's obvious that anyone new to the game will never have the chance to improve their team (or climb to the top) that wealthier players do. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. So EA decided to fuck with everyone and introduce ""easy mode.""   I feel bad for people whose filter just got ruined. Then again, the game is coming to an end. And as /u/dubsallday put it, it's just a game. My guess is the people who use these kinds of filters have FAR better teams than anyone else. So hopefully it's not the end of the world."
MaddenMobileForums,3d9ymi,ZtheT,4,Tue Jul 14 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. I've made my share of millions, my team is at a cool 101, and I'm not going to be improving it with what I make off using this method anymore. Yes you can make a nice amount of coin still, but again, not at the same volume as before. Why not give back to this sub full of actual, fellow players? We have some here making alt accounts, buying 20+ legend packs (I've done this), while fellow users can't even afford a single pack (I've also given a few enough to buy all 4 packs)."
MaddenMobileForums,3d9ymi,Reereez95,3,Tue Jul 14 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no complaints about alt accounts, but the number of people who have multiple 100+ OVR teams is ridiculous."
MaddenMobileForums,3d9ymi,apollonese,2,Tue Jul 14 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"If this is EA's reasoning, it's just dumb. I got good at making coins through a lot of effort. I never paid a dime. I never used a bot. I just worked hard and learned how to use the AH to my advantage. If EA made an easy mode to negate how hard and time consuming it was for me to earn the coins to get the team I have, than they are bigger idiots than I previously thought."
MaddenMobileForums,3d9ymi,apollonese,2,Tue Jul 14 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"It really wouldn't surprise me if this was their reasoning. It's EA.

MaddenMobileForums,3db04e,footballdude8686,2,Tue Jul 14 22:00:07 2015 UTC,Frozen Lambert would be good. Can be had for about 300k.
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,apollonese,7,Tue Jul 14 13:01:46 2015 UTC,"There should be no option that allows two competing teams to be on different difficulty levels.

MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,ZtheT,2,Tue Jul 14 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"Totally, or they should just match up each team's average OVR score so the playing field is the same. All 105's would play all 105's. No need for anything but that in my opinion."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,ky27,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think they kind of do that, but people exploit it by using a lower OVR lineup during the matchup process and then putting much better players in when the actual tourney starts"
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,RFA13,3,Tue Jul 14 13:45:59 2015 UTC,They should take the highest OVR rating based on every player on your team and bench haha - that'll teach those fuckers.

MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,5,Tue Jul 14 15:18:48 2015 UTC,yeah I thought it was stupid when a level 17 with 85 overall was able to score 24 points on my 106 defense..
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, wtf!?!? What do you mean different levels? Is this something new? Please, someone explain this to me."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,3,Tue Jul 14 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"with the latest update, there is an ""easy"" setting for leagues. They can set it and it essentially makes any 106 defense act like an 85 defense. Its fucked."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,5,Tue Jul 14 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"That's some bullshit. There's no point in upgrading your team then (let alone even trying in tournaments).  I know EA is trying to make the game better (and easier for newcomers), but this is a bush-league move. One day they come out with a way to clamp down on force-closing (or at least prevent it when turnovers occur), and the next day they provide an alternative method to exploit the game. Of course people are going to want the top players in the game. But when it comes to H2H and tournaments they'll just insert a weaker line-up (with a high card here and there) in order to win. Most tournaments will probably end in ties now, because everyone will be able to score 24 (when this update occurs).  I know there are plenty of people who have exploited the game (via glitches, force-closing, and scamming) to reach their high status, but it's unfair to turn around and give all the newbies the advantages. This occurs in real life too! Some people believe that in order to offset discrimination, it needs to occur back to the people who once perpetuated. Why don't we just stop it altogether, huh!?!?!? But that's a conversation for another day.  EA has made some significant strides thus far, but this is a serious step backward."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 15:05:07 2015 UTC,Let's assume that someone with a 105 offense played someone with an 85 defense (after this update). Does this mean the 85 defense will act like a 105 defense now?   I'm just wondering cause I'd like to get an idea of how much this settings crap will fuck people over.
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 15:07:17 2015 UTC,This ironically happens the day after I get my defense to a 106. Fuck EA and their timing.
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Reereez95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"there's nothing happening after an update - this came in with the latest update, it's going on NOW - that's why its fucking with everything."

MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,joey_34,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:01 2015 UTC,So does that mean that an 85 OVR defense could act like a 105 defense if someone drove on it with a 105 offense?
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,Bar-Tal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"nope, it means every team basically acts like an 85 defense. It just slows everything down so its crazy easy to score. If you see players scoring in 1 drive on very high defenses, chances are they are playing on easy mode."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,tlk742,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"Well, this makes sense now. With EA releasing Legend Packs every weekend for longer periods of time (you can also buy 4 now instead of 3), I think I've reached a conclusion: EA is trying to fuck up their app.  There really is no logical conclusion or reasoning here. It's just the only answer. Market prices were insanely low this weekend. Why? Because people went on Legend Pack binges and got really, REALLY lucky. Now they're making every defense the equivalent of an 85!? There's no way this stuff carries over to the new game. No way (hopefully)!!! This ""easy setting"" crap will destroy every and all top leagues.   This is just my theory. No rhyme or reason behind it. It just makes the most sense to me. Would be nice for EA to release a formal statement announcing they've officially gone off the deep end."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,EAVTank,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"My league commish set the level to ""rookie"" so whatever we do, it will be super easy. For example, I have Tucker as my Kicker and because it's rookie level, the ball will always land around the 10 yard line. I'm guessing the stats are nerfed for every player. And secondly, I'm able to break off long runs and shed tacklers when we do vs other leagues."
MaddenMobileForums,3d8zg5,EAVTank,2,Tue Jul 14 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"Wait where is ""easy mode"" i dont know where it is at. I'm pretty sure im up to date with the game. I'm also on android"
MaddenMobileForums,3d9rck,ghd1353,5,Tue Jul 14 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see AJ Green get a 99 card (personally, he's my favorite WR in the current NFL).  I'm the furthest thing from a Bronco fan, but the Chris Harris Jr. FE card is a bit of a letdown. IMO, he's a top 5 corner (at least) in the league, but he continues to fly under the radar.   For as much as I love AJ Green, he had a down season this year. Meanwhile, Chris Harris' performance was one of the best among corners in the league (on the #3 defense this past season). So AJ gets a 99, but all they can muster for Harris is a 96? Classic EA."
MaddenMobileForums,3d9rck,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:05 2015 UTC,completely agree Chris Harris deserves better

If the criminal did not turn off Location Services or reset the phone after he/she stole it, you can find it using these steps:  For iPhones, go to iCloud.com and go to Find my iPhone to fnd the approximate location.

MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,Robotsaur,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"Lost Matthews, Lopez, and Batum too. The starting line up is currently looking to be Lillard/McCollum/Aminu/Meyers Leonard/Plumlee."
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,gimpisgawd,2,Wed Jul 15 01:47:35 2015 UTC,"Favorites to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl:   Seattle Seahawks Green Bay Packers   Favorites to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl:   New England Patriots Baltimore Ravens Indianapolis Colts (despite their offseason causing me to vomit)   Predicted SB Match-up:  Green Bay v. Baltimore   In all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised if SEA or NE made it to the SB again. Who knows, maybe we could have a SB 49 rematch (which I would be in complete favor for, even if my Pats lost this time around). My SB match-up is contingent on GB getting home field advantage throughout the playoffs and BAL being a wild card team that gets hot in the postseason. Of course all predictions hinge on the health of a team. I don't believe GB or BAL will be the best team in the league next year (that will still go to SEA), but I do think they'll get hot at the right time.  SB Winner:   No idea. Whoever wins will win by a small margin. GB has the offense and BAL has the defense. The deciding factor could come from how well GB's defense matches up against BAL's offense.  SB MVP: The QB of whichever team wins  OPOY: Aaron Rodgers  Dark Horse Candidate: Odell Beckham Jr  I think the winner of this award will come out of the NFC North this year. I almost put Adrian Peterson too, but there's a more fitting award for me. Barring an Odell Beckham onslaught (or a bounce-back performance by Calvin Johnson), I think Rodgers wins this award.  DPOY: JJ Watt  Dark Horse Candidates: Every other top defender  I was admittedly lazy with this prediction. Barring a down season, I think Watt will take this award home again. I didn't list any names for darkhorse candidates because there are too many to list. You've got Justin Houston, Von Miller, Richard Sherman, Luke Kuechly, Ndamukong Suh... too many to list! It really is anyone's award because of how blessed the NFL is with defensive talent. But I'm taking the easy way out and giving it to Watt.  ROY: Jameis Winston  Once again I was lazy with this one. So lazy I didn't even list any darkhorse candidates. It's not that I think Winston will run away with the award. Tbh, a lot of it depends on the player's current situation (starter versus back up) and how well they adapt to the NFL. So any rookie with talent stands a reasonable chance to breakout in their first season. I can't even remember whether the award is split by conference, so I'm taking the obvious choice and going with Winston. Word from camp has been positive, so I'll go with it.  Comeback Player of the Year: Adrian Peterson  This is an obvious choice to me. People may disagree, but I think Peterson still has a lot left in the tank.  Walter Payton Man of the Year Award:  Up in the air. Beats me how they determine this award.  AP NFL MVP: Andrew Luck  Dark Horse Candidates: Aaron Rodgers  I only listed two potential players for this award. Why? I'm pretty confident in my choice... and because QBs stand the best chance of winning this award. Despite all the complaints that Rodgers won MVP last year over Watt, the choice does make sense. Rodgers provides more value to GB than Watt does to Houston. Too bad there isn't a Best Player of the Year award we could have given Watt for his historical performance.   Moving on: I think Luck will win this award and, despite all his unnecessary INTs, I'm surprised he hasn't won it already. That means a lot coming from me - a Patriots fan who absolutely hates the Colts.   But how can you think a 3rd year player should have won MVP already? He hasn't even done much. He throws too many INTs. This is mostly true. Luck actually has done a lot so far, but the prevailing issue is the number of times he turns over the ball.   So why do I think he'll be MVP? Cause he actually is the most valuable player in the NFL. When people discuss Rodgers being MVP, they point to the times he was absent from the field. The team did not fare very well. What people forget is how terrible the Colts were before they drafted Andrew Luck. I used to think that 2011 Colts team (absent of Peyton Manning) was tanking in order to get the #1 pick in the draft. In hindsight? They were just a terrible team. One can still argue that they tanked, but there is no argument about how good the team was when they played their best: they stunk. You can't blame a team whose wind has been taken out of their sails because their star QB is sidelined a whole season for a surgery. After Luck was drafted, changes could already be seen with this team. Life had suddenly been breathed into a team that previously could compete with the 2008 Detroit Lions for one of the worst teams of all time (drafting T.Y. didn't hurt either).   So I think Luck will have the best season of his career with a bevy of weapons and win NFL MVP. He is the most valuable player in the league, because without him the Colts are shit. Will the team be good enough to make the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen. I would have liked to see more focus on defense (rather than gathering more WRs to satisfy the front office's fetish), but they're good enough that I listed them as a SB contender. Naturally, I think Rodgers will win this if Luck doesn't.  Prediction for my team's season (Patriots):  I agree with /u/ram1113 that Garoppolo will lead the Pats to a 2-2 record. When Brady returns, they'll finish with a 12-4 record. My prediction is that they make the playoffs with home field advantage (2nd seed). They will make the AFC Championship where they will lose to the wild card Baltimore Ravens.  I do think the Patriots can make the Super Bowl, but I highly doubt it. If they did appear in Super Bowl 50, my prediction is that they would lose."
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,Reereez95,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:13 2015 UTC,agreed however i hope the pats do the whole thing
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,zaalp,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:24 2015 UTC,Obviously this is TL;DR but I wrote it anyways.
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"yes this was most definitely TL;DR.  I agree with most of your points, but I think the Pats will struggle more than fans think. Considering their defense is going to be weaker than it ever has been in the last 10 years and Brady is aging, I think 10-6 is a very reasonable prediction for them."
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"We made the Super Bowl in 2011 with a bottom 5 defense, I believe. Our defense is still solid with Collins, Jones, Ninkovich, Sheard, Hightower up front and McCourty in the secondary. Brady might be aging, but he doesn't look like he's slowing down and I feel the suspension will motivate him. Yes 10-6 is reasonable, but no way we finish any lower than that or miss the playoffs."
MaddenMobileForums,3da1cr,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"no, youre 100% right, the pats are still strong and they definitely are a top contender for the playoffs.  I just think, if this is the year they lose the division title, it wouldnt surprise me"

MaddenMobileForums,3da07p,Syth1579,5,Tue Jul 14 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one who thinks this. I've commented on every thread related to the recent FE releases, and each time I mention how Chris Harris deserves better.   It's kind of funny, cause I said pretty much everything you've mentioned. ""He previously had a 95 OVR card. He is a top 5 corner in the game."" It's a shame this is what EA did to him. It puzzles me.  Final Edition could be based off of body of work, in which case 96 might be more appropriate (as he has had some injury troubles). But if it's based off the most recent season, AJ Green should be the 96 and Chris Harris should be the 99. I love Green, but his injuries set him back this season. Meanwhile, Harris was healthy (for once) and had the best season of his career on the #3 defense of 2014.   So I'm not sure what EA's thought process was here, but I found Harris' 96 FE card to be a bit disrespectful. Trust me /u/Synth1579, you're not the only one who feels this way. I'm the furthest thing from a Bronco fan and this release bothered me."
MaddenMobileForums,3da07p,Reereez95,3,Tue Jul 14 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"At least there is someone I can agree with. I thought that the 92 Von Miller card was absolutely insulting, and then to try to give him a 96 to compensate for it? He's one if the best linebackers in the league, and I'm glad he got the 99 CW, even though I felt that his stats were a little off on that card. Now to give Chris Harris, who came off plauged with injuries and was finally uninjured, like you said, and played like a top 5 corner in the league, its insulting to give him the 96. Hell, Brent Grimes got a 98, Revis has a 98, Sherman has 99s, Pat Pete has a 99 and Vontae Davis has a 99, but they feel that Chris Harris can't compete with them? That and Aqib Talib too, who I feel EASILY deserves it."
MaddenMobileForums,3da07p,Reereez95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"Talib is who they should have given a 96 FE card. Chris Harris should have been a 99, and tbh I felt that EA could have made a better Revis card too. Von Miller definitely deserved better. I'm glad Justin Houston got recognition for his great season, but his stats were a little weak. As a Pats fan I liked the PH Collins card, but it's weird that they made him better than Justin Houston or Von Miller. Collins had a breakout 2nd year but he's nowhere near being that good yet."

MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,awesom567,3,Tue Jul 14 17:03:39 2015 UTC,Console could kill all Mobile users' chances of getting a 99 Manning. Peyton and Payton both have amazing 99 versions on Madden 15 for console. So the chances of Mobile releasing either player at 99 OVR were slim.
MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 14 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. Peyton has been screwed over with his terrible cards on Mobile. Arguably a top 5 QB in the history of the NFL, and he still only has a 92 card on mobile. Having a 99 card on console is a terrible excuse for not giving him another 99 card on console, his first on Mobile. Bo has 3 99 cards right now, I don't see what's wrong with Peyton having 2 on console and 1 on mobile."

MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,afxdub,2,Tue Jul 14 16:55:29 2015 UTC,And still no FE cards for the Texans. At the very least Duane Brown or Brandon Brooks should be getting an FE card. Maybe Kareem Jackson deserves one too. His highest is only 85.
MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,theskyhooker,2,Tue Jul 14 19:40:11 2015 UTC,Maybe the Texans should've had one of the Cowboys' 9 fucking FE cards.
MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,afxdub,2,Wed Jul 15 02:52:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. A team with no QB doesn't win 9 games by accident. There are some good players on the Texans roster. It's a shame EA isn't recognizing them. Foster's best card is a 90. Really?
MaddenMobileForums,3d9t9l,theskyhooker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:42:28 2015 UTC,Brian Cushing should get a better card IMO.  Johnathan Joseph could use a better one too.
MaddenMobileForums,3d9s5z,TheRealFluffy0ne,5,Tue Jul 14 16:44:58 2015 UTC,I like this card  :)  Disappointed EA gave Chris Harris a 96 overall card (considering his last card was a 95 OVR). Dude is underrated as hell.

MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,theskyhooker,10,Mon Jul 13 23:35:54 2015 UTC,Brace yourself for incoming Peyton Manning comments.
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,UnknownWalnut,7,Mon Jul 13 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"Haha, true.  However, to you Peyton fans:  Remember that EA only cares about console.  Peyton Manning has a 95, a 97, and a 99 card on console.  Therefore, EA has effectively done Peyton Manning justice.  However, even on console, Marino has nothing."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Reereez95,8,Mon Jul 13 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"I'll second that opinion. When people discuss the top QBs in NFL history, the QBs in the discussion usually have a combination of stats and accomplishments (think Joe Montana and Tom Brady). Dan Marino is one of the few mentioned who has never won a Super Bowl ring. IMO, he's the best QB in NFL history that never won a ring. The man was transcendent at what he did, so much so that he is still revered for his career today.  But it also doesn't surprise me that his best card in the game is a 96 OVR. This is EA we're talking about. They gave 99 OVR MM versions to Plaxico Burress and RGIII...   What's even more of a shame is that they can't seem to acquire the player rights of other former NFL players (i.e. Dick Butkus, Jim Brown and Chuck Bednarik to name a few oldies). There are easier player rights acquire than those players, but they don't even have Randy Moss!!! And some of their 99 OVR cards have terrible individual stats. Can anyone explain why MM Bruce Smith, Reggie White and Deacon Jones suck compared to MM Julius Peppers!? Hell, they just gave Deacon the same exact stats as his frozen card - the epitome of laziness.   So as a rule of thumb: EA is illogical."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,TheRealFluffy0ne,6,Mon Jul 13 23:52:47 2015 UTC,Lol Dick Butkus...  Yea that's right... I'm five... =P
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,UnknownWalnut,4,Tue Jul 14 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. Another player that they should have give better stats is Walter Payton. He does have a 99 card, which makes me a bit happy, but the stats aren't the best. He's one of the best RBs in history in my opinion, top 3 if you asked me (along with Sanders and Brown). That's just my opinion, so don't yell at me."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Reereez95,4,Tue Jul 14 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was not very happy with his card in Madden Mobile. Unfortunately (just like with Peyton Manning), Payton did receive a better card in Madden 15. So there was no chance of the Mobile users getting him  :("
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Reereez95,4,Tue Jul 14 00:31:58 2015 UTC,I'd also love me some Walter Jones too.

MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,UffaloIlls,3,Tue Jul 14 02:33:01 2015 UTC,The HOF guard on OJ Simpson's offensive lines. His last name is really hard to spell.
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,PackersMadden,2,Tue Jul 14 10:04:36 2015 UTC,"Joe Delamielleure, a legendary HOF guard for the bills during the OJ Simpson era. He's kinda obscure, but he is recognised as one of the main reasons OJ could hit 2000 yards"

MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Syth1579,2,Tue Jul 14 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'm thoroughly surprised EA has never tried to obtain the player rights of Bart Starr. I know a lot of modern NFL fans laud over Rodgers, but as of now Starr is the greatest QB in Packers history (and arguably one of the best of all time)."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Reereez95,5,Tue Jul 14 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Reereez95 on the part of Deacon. I mean, the guy invented sacks, and TECHNICALLY has the record for single sacks in a season, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the seasons were even shorter back then. I don't see why they have him the exact same card. I still consider Deacon the best in the game, even over White and Smith, and even Watt for that matter. Peppers to me doesn't compare either. I understand giving Watt an amazing card, since he can probably be the best DE we have ever seen in a few years, but still, Deacon was a BEAST and a huge fear on the field. I'm actually surprised after that stunt that they upgraded NTL."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,EaglePride101,2,Tue Jul 14 04:30:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this. I almost brought this up myself, but I didn't want to stir the pot and get away from my point. Deacon was technically (and unofficially - because the sack didn't exist as a stat yet) the first defensive player to ever have multiple 20 sack seasons. Watt is officially the first to do this, but people who follow football and its history know Deacon did it first.  And I completely agree. I don't mind EA making Watt the best DE in the game. Tbh, I don't mind Peppers getting a really good card; I could care less. What bothers me is that EA pulled some lazy shit with clearly better players, which sucks even more when you consider the limited number of player rights they have for former players. Compared to the Madden 25 app, the number of legends in Madden Mobile is pathetic."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,afxdub,2,Tue Jul 14 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"Dammit M25 had London Fletcher and Sean Taylor?  Wow I wish I played that.  Two of my favorite players of all time for sure.  Also yeah, I was pretty disappointed with MM Deacon's stats."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,TheyCallMeHero_,2,Wed Jul 15 02:28:12 2015 UTC,You know who really deserves a card?  Jerome Brown.
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,Jason10005,2,Tue Jul 14 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"True, but I actually think the card is an accurate representation of his skills. Marino could throw and all of his throwing stats are great. The reason his card is ""only"" a 96 is because his SPD, ACC, and AGI are so low. But that's also accurate.   The 99 Brady and RG3 cards are ridiculously buffed to get to 99. Brady with 100 TPW and 72 SPD?  In what universe?  Those aren't his skills. That's not what makes him a great QB.   While Marino's card isn't a 99, I think it's actually one of the most accurate cards in the game. And it plays awesome too."
MaddenMobileForums,3d6s2u,turkmileymileyturk,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:00 2015 UTC,I think Troy Aikman deserves a better card as well. The man is a HoF QB and the best he has is a 94 (?) OVR card.

I did a lot of gold trophy selling over the past few months (buy at 3500, sell at 5000 and it always sold) up until maybe a month ago.

MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,stingerbee12,10,Mon Jul 13 14:09:36 2015 UTC,hmm interesting... Does that mean that this will happen for live events as well? or propacks? I hate it when the game timesout on me an I lose progress or the pack
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"Reading EA's post, I think this will only happen for turnovers. So here are my thoughts:  Force-Closing will still be possible:   This recent EA post tells us that turnovers in games will be handled differently. So when you throw an INT, the game automatically registers the turnover. Even if someone force-closes to stop a pick-6, the drive will end. Same goes for fumbles recovered by the defense. Even if  you force-close to stop the return for a TD, the drive will be over when you re-open the app.  But the real question is whether this stops force-closing altogether. My thinking? It doesn't. This is an amazing stride by EA, but it will not stop all exploits. I believe that people will still be able to force close successfully if they do it before the ball reaches the receiver or before a fumble is recovered by a player. I have no basis for this; it's just my thought process after reading the blog post. It will be unfortunate if force-closing is still possible, so let's hope EA put the kibosh on it altogether.  This change should not affect live events:  This sounds like a H2H (and possibly season mode) thing only. EA recognizes that it cannot tweak the game so that all app exits cause a person to fail a drive, event or game. That is partly why I believe force-closing in general will still be possible. Given EA's history of shotty connections and ""Network Timeouts,"" this is not an option. So I think this change to the new season will not apply to any and all game exits (when in an event). That would just be unfair.  [EDIT]: Note sure why this received down votes, but oh well."
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  interesting analysis. I was thinking the same thing when I read the part where it says specifically H2H, but then I got optimistic about it. I figured EA was making play registry a non internet thing. The result of the play would first be logged in game then sent out to the servers, therefore, force closing would not interrupt the user's connection to the server because the server connection would happen after the initial and instantaneous recording of the play result...  Edit: That was all very technical and I probably sound like an idiot to anyone who actually knows anything about IT/computer science, lol. whatever..."
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jul 13 18:49:51 2015 UTC,I replied to Reereez comment instead of this one... While it is technically feasible it most likely wouldn't be implemented this way due to the ease with which it could be hacked...
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,TheRealFluffy0ne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:09:46 2015 UTC,I didnt even think of that! nice analysis
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,UffaloIlls,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"I understood what you meant. I'm not in IT or anything like that, so I have no idea whether it makes sense to someone with the technical experience. Yet the concept is a nice one.  If that is the way EA has changed H2H, then force-closing in general will be gone. But I'm not sure if that's what they're doing (or if your idea is possible)."
MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"It is technically feasible to store drive data in game and send it when connection is re-established. The main problem with this though is that it will be hacked. No if ands or buts about it. This is mainly because whatever data encryption method you use can be reverse engineered by a persistent enough hacker who decompiles the app code.  The result of such a hack would be that someone could manually edit their drives and send them to the server. That's why pretty much all mobile games keep their data server side, where it is much more difficult to access.  Even if local data wasn't hacked, you could still just clear your game cache after a drive to reset the play. More work but still do-able."

MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,TheRealFluffy0ne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"I had an interesting thought. Since they removed the ability to ""user"" the receiver (and assuming they leave it that way) EA could in theory simulate the result of any pass the moment the QB releases the ball. At least simulate enough to decide if the reception will be made or not.  This would in theory prevent any force close that occurred after the ball was released... Running plays are a different beast though...  Anyways, guess we'll just have to wait and see what they've come up with..."

MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,Namesdontmatter1,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"It will be interesting to see how the game actually reocgnizes a force close. Because you could still throw a bad pass and FC in mid air and I bet it returns to the previous down. Same thing when you throw an INT. Lets say you throw one and you FC. So the game just gives the ball to the other team but what about the potential for a pick 6? Not sure how that will work. Also it only says Head to Head. I wonder if it applies to season, tournaments, and live events"

MaddenMobileForums,3d4m9z,Dubzil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"They are specifically referring to after a turnover.  If you network timeout after an int, same shit.

MaddenMobileForums,3d63c7,joshlake123,2,Mon Jul 13 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"I would continue to save your coins for this weekend. When Legend Packs drop, look at the prices and buy whichever is cheaper.  If it were me with 4.5 million coins, I would get Suh to go with Randle. I love Watt and the edge is important, but interior defensive line can make or break your run stopping game. But if you like Watt better, go for him.  You don't have to wait until the weekend. This is just my recommendation (given the craziness of this recent weekend)."
MaddenMobileForums,3d63c7,Reereez95,3,Mon Jul 13 20:42:32 2015 UTC,Is it confirmed anywhere that Legends will drop again this weekend?
MaddenMobileForums,3d63c7,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"No  :(  But we've had them for two weekends in a row now, so I just assumed (which can make an ass out of myself). Given that you can buy 4 legend packs on weekends now instead of 3, I figured that EA was creating a splurge frenzy in the final weeks before the reset.  For all I know, we could have to deal with crappy TOTY packs for two straight weekends before Legend packs again."
MaddenMobileForums,3d63c7,Reereez95,4,Mon Jul 13 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but if there is one thing I learned it's not to trust EA with any kind of consistent logic."
MaddenMobileForums,3d63c7,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 20:54:12 2015 UTC,Too true. EA has no logic whatsoever.

MaddenMobileForums,3d626m,fantasyfootballiowa,2,Mon Jul 13 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"My guess: so many people pulled him in packs that the supply vastly outnumbered the demand.  It's partly why Ray Lewis and Jack Lambert dropped to 1 mil each, Peppers dropped to 1.5 mil, Watt dropped to 3 mil, Peterson dropped to 3.2 mil, Suh dropped to 4 mil (sort of), Lawrence Taylor dropped below 2 mil (I got him for 1.6), Brooks dropped to 1.5 mil, Legend Bo dropped to 1 mil, Gronk dropped to 1 mil, Dierdorf dropped back down to 1.5 mil, Upshaw dropped below 2 mil (for bid) and Brady dropped below 1 mil...  The pack luck was insane this weekend, and it pained me that I only had enough coins to get LT and Lewis for my team. Hopefully EA keeps up the Legend Packs every single weekend before the reset (and has Gridiron Packs during the week), cause I don't like TOTY packs.   So many people were pulling Lacey that he was bound to drop in price eventually."
MaddenMobileForums,3d626m,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"The MM rookies always drop during Legends because of the supply and demand. Legend Bo is not at 1 mil. I sold him for 1,6 mil in less than 5 minutes on Saturday. Sure, some people get silly and post him for a mil, but he doesn't last a minute at that price.  Lacey being a FE is still a rare bird. The only reason you see more of him with Legends is because of how many people are buying packs. But while supply and demand certainly are a factor, you have Antonio Brown who is still pricing above a million and he's a week older.  I think u/fantasyfootballiowa might be onto something."
MaddenMobileForums,3d626m,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:30 2015 UTC,I saw a couple Legend Bo Jacksons at 1.15 mil BIN the other day. Naturally they didn't stay in the AH for very long.
MaddenMobileForums,3d626m,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have seen some pop up low. At odd hours, they can sit a little longer because less people are looking. The same day I sold mine for 1.6 there was one for 1.1 that sat for about 30 minutes. I wish I would have flipped it, but was nervous it was a sign his price was dropping that low."
MaddenMobileForums,3d626m,theskyhooker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the only thing that sucks about these low prices: no guarantee. When I see cards on the AH, I automatically assume they are new pulls or someone trying to sell an old card. For all I know, it could be the same person repeatedly trying to push a card at their price.   So while Bo is tempting to flip at 1.1 mil, that could be as high as people are willing to pay for him now. Luckily you were able to sell yours at 1.6 million. If more MM Bo cards are pulled next weekend, his price could drop further (assuming that's the correlation)."

I think there are only two things that will bring his price further down. One would be if/when they release Legend Packs. Two is people wanting to sell him as it gets closer to the reset. They might get desperate. But with this it really depends how many are out there and how many buyers there are. If the instant a few pop up at 6 mil they get snatched up, it's not going to drop much lower so easily."
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 17:50:22 2015 UTC,He's certainly less scarce than sanders though which is nice. I assume youre keeping sanders for HB1 and putting Bo in flex?
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Sanders is like a ghost. That is how I am using them, but I really want to get more use from Bo. Not enough FB plays."
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Mon Jul 13 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, i agree. in maddens past, there were so many playcalling options (and hot routes). Now there are only 2 options for FB"
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:58 2015 UTC,I get a lot of use from him on Pass Attacks. PA Comeback Slide and PA Boot are two of my favorite plays to run. Rarely countered on top of that.
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Mon Jul 13 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Have you ever used Flats? Great play.  In most coverages, you have 2 vertical deep routes that will be easy to hit over the top and 1 FB flat route where as soon as the FB hits the LOS, he starts moving, uncovered up the field. If you time it right before he hits the FS, he can make an open catch an has nothing but open field in front of him for another 30-40 yards."
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Mon Jul 13 18:28:10 2015 UTC,I have. For some reason I seem to get very little time to get a pass off with that play. Maybe I'm just unlucky or am using it at the wrong time though.  It seems like a barely have time to fire it off to my TE when I run it though. Rarely do I have enough time to figure out if my FB is going to be open or not. If I hold the ball for more than a second or two I get sacked.  I should probably experiment with it a bit more...
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"You probably have Brady, right? I use Vick and roll out a bit. It's also great for scrambling.  The timing on the play is key because the blocking is a bit wonky.  I've noticed the left OT is never where I want him to be, so I usually step up and roll to the left (Vick is left handed, so maybe this wont work with Brady).  Cover LBs will step up to cover the Qb and the deep CBs will be long gone, so the FB should be wide open"
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,soenottelling,2,Mon Jul 13 18:34:26 2015 UTC,Ah yes... I play MM Brady and he is far too slow for such shenanigans =P
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"Consider RG3 or Vick as an option. Dont ditch Brady of course, but for gameplay, mix it up a bit sometimes.  It's a lot of fun when I look at my H2H drive charts because the play is always listed as a long pass, but it says ""M. Vick Rush for 60 yards,"" lol.  Plus I'm sure you can afford to have another QB on your roster (Vick is only 200k, which is dirt cheap!)"
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:18 2015 UTC,Lol yea I played Vick for a long time. Pretty much till MM Brady came along. He's a lot of fun to scramble around with. Might have to mess around with him or RG3 again now that season is winding to a close.
MaddenMobileForums,3d5eyv,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:26 2015 UTC,Lol. I run those plays and probably pass to him not even realizing it.

MaddenMobileForums,3d3059,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 15:05:04 2015 UTC,"He's all jacked up and boosted but what does the rest of your team look like at the expense of boosting? I'm not a big fan of using weak players just to boost others, but hey everyone has their preferences."

MaddenMobileForums,3d3059,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"So to truly compare him to Rice and Fitz, it needs to be without boosts, unless you plan on keeping the boosting line-up. Then you you'd need to see what they all look like with the boosts."
MaddenMobileForums,3d3059,ZtheT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:30:37 2015 UTC,I've played with fitz Unboosted. I've played with Vjax Unboosted. Vjax is the superior WR. The only question will be whether Vjax outplays rice or not. As it sits I say Vjax is either 1 or 2 WR in the game.
MaddenMobileForums,3d3059,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 13 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it's a preference than. VJax to me seems like the ideal deep ball player. Tall and strong gets the job done. But I am not much of a deep ball player. I like players who are quick and willy. My guess is Rice is more a Fitz type than a VJax type, so you'll probably still prefer VJax."
MaddenMobileForums,3d3059,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 13 16:47:58 2015 UTC,Yah I would imagine. If I get rice then I'll have him in the slot most likely.

MaddenMobileForums,3d2r0j,Syth1579,3,Mon Jul 13 05:25:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm just going to give basic suggestions given that I do not know your budget, and I'll try to give reasonable upgrades to help your entire team, not just one position.     OFFENSE:   Zane Beadles MVP for a guard. He has really solid stats for a 94, and boosts really easily. Another suggestion is TOTY Yanda or Boling. Personally, I like Boling's stats better, but Yanda is better for overall. Believe it or not, Kory Lichtensteiger is better for overall, so if you want overall, Kory is your best bet. PH Graham isn't running for much anymore, as far as I know. Only around 230k. Is that is still too high for you, Martellus Bennett FE or Jared Allen CW would be good for a TE. If you can, Ditka and Graham are better for overall, even when replacing Odell. Since you run a FB, I'd buy Bruce Miller. William Perry is great and all, but he is a bit too slow for a FB, but still workable. I found Miller to be a huge upgrade from Perry. QB. Russell Wilson PH or Aaron Rodgers Honors are what I'd recommend without having to spend huge amounts of money on a QB. That, or you can look to see how much FE Luck runs for, as he is a taller (as far as I know), slightly slower version of Wilson. Then again, you are a Cowboys fan, so keeping Romo is prebably your idea.      DEFENSE:   FS upgrade. Harrison Smith is a REALLY good investment on defense. Personally, I prefer Pat Pete PH over Sanders, as Sanders has low strength and hit power, plus you could make a profit off of buying Pat Pete and selling Sanders. That, or keep Sanders and buy Pat Pete for Nickel. For Dime, I used Charles Woodson for a long time, as he provided a jump boost as was the best 98 CB for overall. He may be worth looking into. You have three coverage backers. I'd sell LaVonte and try to pick up a Justin Houston PH or Von Miller CW for now. Thomas in 3-4, Collins on the left and Houston on the right. Honors Donald, TOTW Suh or CW Poe make really good DTs. But since legend packs are out, you can try to build a MJG for a cheap price. Since Legend packs are out, try to get a Bruce Smith for a fairly cheap price. He is a solid DE and good for overall. If that's out of your price range, MF JJ Watt, TOTY Calais Campbell, TOTY Mario Williams or FB Dwight Freeney.      SPECIALS:   Mason Crosby FO has better kicking stats and better overall stats than Gostkowski. Harvin KR and PR are best for overall. At this point, you can invest in the Jon Ryan GC to get the awareness boost to your team. It would also compensate for the loss of Byron Jones' awareness boost.      Hope I could help!"

MaddenMobileForums,3d12i7,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jul 13 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah Freeney was so underrated. He had good coverage, nice speed and great hands. He could pass rush or drop back in coverage...

MaddenMobileForums,3d12i7,StalinOut,3,Mon Jul 13 17:40:46 2015 UTC,I thought is the opposite. They are slow as fuck behind the line of scrimmage and when they hit it is when they start running. But in the picture it looks like manziel is running behind the LOS. So huh idk

You need two RBs, so the best teams still played Legend Bo until now.  NTL has also been in the top 3 CBs in the game.  They're cards have both always been juiced.  The other 99 OVR legends have been outclassed, though.  Walter Payton was never the best (although he should've been), LT wasn't as good as even PH Houston let alone the MMs, and Jerry Rice was still a pretty solid option for a long time."

Both are gold card and are pretty cheap. If you want to spend a little more, look at FB Vonta Leach.   If you just want someone to boost, FB Reggie Bush gives +1 SPD and is an awesome receiver.   Of course, Super Bowl Franco Harris is, IMO the ultimate FB. His blocking stats are amazing and the rest of his stats make him a great running or catching option. But he's a little pricey."

MaddenMobileForums,3cz14h,Wiredbutton,10,Sun Jul 12 01:58:44 2015 UTC,I guess this is good if you're a beginner. Who's mentally challenged. And colorblind.
MaddenMobileForums,3cz14h,C0812,7,Sun Jul 12 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"Uh, no offense, but that's all kinda simple, common sense type of logical steps.  No new, crazy tricks or anything.  The kinda stuff you figure out in about 5 minutes of being on the Auction House"
MaddenMobileForums,3cz14h,Hunter8258,0,Sun Jul 12 02:11:19 2015 UTC,Good stuff for beginners though.

MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,ZtheT,3,Sat Jul 11 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"Well Bo and NTL are the last MM supposedly, and knowing you I would try to target them and finish your ultimate team. After that, have fun with the game for once. Go on a pack opening spree, do something different. I think we reached a point where no new cards are coming, but those investments are risky. The AH is unpredictable at the moment, so time will only tell. I think people will go nuts and everything at the end of the year will be super cheap, or that might be my dream. Don't wait till the end, if you see a decent opportunity to sell, I would."
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,xKizume,2,Sat Jul 11 23:17:25 2015 UTC,"That's my dream too, lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,Hunter8258,0,Sun Jul 12 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"Bo should not be a problem. I have enough coins to get him at his going price. I'm thinking tomorrow he might come down to about 7 mil. NTL, like Jerry Rice, are just dreams. They are so rare. Grinding is getting hard and prices might plummet closer to the end, except for the rare birds like Rice and NTL. Most likely, I sell my lot and play it more safe moving forward, which means making coins will be minimal. So, fair chance I dump 20-30 mil on Pro Packs in the end."
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,BenjimanWa,2,Sat Jul 11 23:21:19 2015 UTC,I'll get Jerry rice or NTL if it's that last thing I do. I got Vjax today for 12.5 mill today so stoked for that.
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,BenjimanWa,0,Sat Jul 11 23:26:37 2015 UTC,Nice!
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,AXZ082,0,Sun Jul 12 00:03:50 2015 UTC,"Also, you must have more coins or a method of getting them that is better than what I know if this is a real option. NTL will likely be in the 25 mil plus range, as is Jerry Rice."
MaddenMobileForums,3cyjyz,MaddenPlaya,2,Sun Jul 12 01:50:09 2015 UTC,Pm me if you really want to know. And yah I got that coinage ready to go.

MaddenMobileForums,3cwoj0,BenjimanWa,2,Sat Jul 11 12:59:54 2015 UTC,Yah u should. I didn't pull shit on my main. Opened 8 on my alts and got 3 MMs. But only use alts if you have money to blow
MaddenMobileForums,3cwoj0,patsman101,2,Sat Jul 11 13:02:33 2015 UTC,"I have about 400k, but I can snipe today and get up to a mil and I can buy like 12 legend packs tmrw"
MaddenMobileForums,3cwoj0,BenjimanWa,2,Sat Jul 11 13:03:50 2015 UTC,Umm yah. It all depends on luck. But opening more packs give you a better chance. Even pulling any Mm almost gives you your money back and usually more

Since you already have a 101 OVR team, the next guys you're looking to are all up in that price range, so I would just keep your LT.

MaddenMobileForums,3cwr7g,patsman101,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:29:05 2015 UTC,I won't get him because any speed boost will bring him back to 99 spd. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the speed boosts for the rest of my team. Cool card design though!

MaddenMobileForums,3cwkdf,captainundypants,3,Sat Jul 11 11:38:04 2015 UTC,Saw that. My heart jumped.
MaddenMobileForums,3cwkdf,ZtheT,3,Sat Jul 11 11:45:16 2015 UTC,And someone else dropped 20mil for the 99 version.
MaddenMobileForums,3cwkdf,ZtheT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:49:52 2015 UTC,"You should've bid! BIN is a waste of $$$$!!  ;D  Nice work, btw."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,NakedTaco,3,Fri Jul 10 22:43:54 2015 UTC,"So, Bo and NTL just get 100s across the board?  They're already kind of OP. Not sure how much better they could be.   Guess I'll save my coins and stop trying to snipe FB Faulk. Save it for the Bo and NTL sell off."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,afxdub,2,Fri Jul 10 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"I think Bo is the straight pull, given how rare he will be there won't be much of a sell off. NTL might drop a bit next round of legends since he looks to be the rookie."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 22:57:20 2015 UTC,That would be funny. The new NTL might be more common than the old NTL.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,afxdub,2,Fri Jul 10 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Mark my words if i pull bo i will list for 5m, is that low? Idk you tell me a low price but still worth it nd ill sell for that if i open him"

MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:40:39 2015 UTC,If there is another Legend Pack. The clock is ticking. Let's hope though.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 10 23:01:07 2015 UTC,Seems like there will be at least one more round of them... fingers crossed...
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,9,Fri Jul 10 23:13:42 2015 UTC,Damn... The Bo we have now is second only to Barry. How much better could they make him?
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,cheesypie777,6,Fri Jul 10 22:45:48 2015 UTC,Of course they release an MM Bo to make my current Bo Jackson look inferior.  Fuck you EA. I couldn't afford the new Bo even in my dreams.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,Reereez95,6,Fri Jul 10 23:12:12 2015 UTC,Ikr. The only 2 legends to hold their own against the mobile masters will get their own super fuck crazy OP mobile masters.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,cheesypie777,6,Sat Jul 11 00:14:39 2015 UTC,They did not...THEY DID NOT!!!
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,DeadToWrites,6,Fri Jul 10 22:56:51 2015 UTC,If these are the last two than I can accept it... going out on a high note makes sense.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,6,Fri Jul 10 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"This could very well be the last MM pair before the reset. The recycled just about every Legend player in the game. The only way I see them release new MMs is if they do it for current players.  Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers are fair game. Now that I think about it, Joe Montana is too. He never received an MM version."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,Reereez95,4,Fri Jul 10 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Doubt Montana gets one due to the pending release of his game, which is a direct competitor to Madden Mobile. Was hoping for a MM Franco personally =/  Agree this seems like a logical place to end though. Then again, when has EA ever done the logical thing...?"
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,4,Fri Jul 10 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"True! I completely forgot about the Joe Montana game coming out. EA (like what Marvel did with Fox over the X-men) will likely not ""advertise"" for him.  A month ago I would have said, ""Franco likely won't get a Mobile Masters version because they gave him a 98 SB Legend card."" 8 Gronks and 6 James Harrisons later, I think it's entirely possible for Franco to get a Mobile Masters version.   Who knows, maybe Elway and Marino get MM versions too."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm actually kind of pissed about this. I'm all for new MMs and better players, but the recycling of previous players is redundant and predictable. Especially when they already have a 99 OVR card.  ... but mostly I'm pissed because my Bo isn't a top 2 HB in the game anymore  :("
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,Reereez95,3,Fri Jul 10 23:28:19 2015 UTC,This just in: More Legend and Xmas Bos on the AH than I have ever seen. People trying to cash in before his value drops.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"Damn it, I just picked up Bo two weeks ago for 1.75 million. Might cash out on him now, fudge."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,xKizume,2,Sat Jul 11 00:24:39 2015 UTC,"Lol. I was typing so fast I wrote ""UT"" instead of UL. But I'm sure you guys know what I meant."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,Syth1579,2,Fri Jul 10 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Wait, who would get the rookie then? Both had no rookies originally, and as we have usually seen, the trend is that the MM that did not have a rookie legend gets the MM rookie."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,DeadToWrites,3,Fri Jul 10 23:00:19 2015 UTC,I'm thinking NTL may be the rookie since Bo has two legend cards ( 3 including this one) and had a rookie card in the Christmas event.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,DeadToWrites,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:55 2015 UTC,Don't forget about his GT on console too
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:49 2015 UTC,Barry had a good 3 week run as the GOAT
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,jonnytranftw,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:02:35 2015 UTC,Lol it was fun while it lasted
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,alexrider2398,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:47 2015 UTC,I think ntl will be #1 for sure if he has 99 play rec.  Bo will probably rate higher than barry for OVR as well since his catching numbers will be in the 90s.   With that being said bo will power truck a bit more over barry so it will come down to the old debate between agi trucking and str trucking and personal preference.   If I were a Bo owner I wouldn't pay the 30 million premium for the marginal upgrades in stats you'd be getting.
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,alexrider2398,2,Fri Jul 10 23:09:12 2015 UTC,These are the last two Mobile Masters as well
MaddenMobileForums,3cuox9,theskyhooker,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:55 2015 UTC,Really? Was that confirmed?

MaddenMobileForums,3cv9to,JacobKHD,3,Sat Jul 11 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"Welcome man! I love the new design, your very talented, good work! If you every need any help on anything or have any questions, feel free to ask me or anybody on this sub-reddit, most of us are really friendly. For some ideas, I can suggest a few if you would like.   Have a schedule on the sidebar, and/or what's today category.   Every day there are new live events, and sometimes their rotations are predictable. If there was a schedule set on what will happen in the future, it would help out a lot of people.  For example for today-   Daily Warm Up - 4 Stamina - WR Route  Gauntlet - 3-3-4 Stamina - Catch in Zone - Run through Zone - 4th Quarter VS Redskin  It may be a little confusing if you haven't played the game, and might be a lot of work to keep updated, but it's an idea.  Here is an example from the Xbox one sub-reddit :   http://m.imgur.com/7DV07P2.jpg   Today's Pack - Show what new packs you can buy today, and how much.   For example - Legend Packs - $68,500 - 3 limit  This would be much easier to do since the pack rotation is usually 3-4 days compared to the everyday event thing.  Another thing is you could add this weeks NFL matchs when the season starts, guessing most of us are football fans.   Updated FAQ, rules and links would be nice as well. I like /u/Syth1579 idea, maybe be hard to do.   /r/MaddenUltimateTeam/ has a great side bar if you need an example.   Flairs!    And the game is actually pretty fun if you like the concept of packs, stock and football. It's worth a shot!  Sorry for the long rant, but welcome to our subreddit man!  Edit - Looks like the numbering is messed up on my post and I can't fix it, oh well lol."
MaddenMobileForums,3cv9to,ZtheT,6,Sat Jul 11 03:02:54 2015 UTC,These are great ideas. I will add them to the list and see what I can do!

MaddenMobileForums,3csq6t,VictorVonDoom99,3,Fri Jul 10 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there. I don't understand the logic of paying real currency for fake currency (even if you justify it as ""entertainment"").  To each their own, but I'll never spend my money on coins in this game. Especially since the game will reset every year (or at the very least end after a season)."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvag,bran861,4,Fri Jul 10 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"Gridiron or Players. It's been longer for Players, but EA does not always follow the same order. That said, I'm calling Players. Gridiron was the last pack before the lockdown. We've only had two new packs since to turned them back on."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvag,ZtheT,3,Sat Jul 11 00:26:12 2015 UTC,Gridiron seems probable. I plan to pick up the 99 FE guys for my alt account if that's the case =)
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvag,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:39:18 2015 UTC,I think its player packs. At least i hope cuz i still havent sold the Kicker/Punter collectibles ive been hoarding since last gridiron packs
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvag,fappingwaffle,3,Sat Jul 11 00:02:11 2015 UTC,I would give a good bet that it's gridiron. So you might wanna sell those off.

MaddenMobileForums,3cv8x5,UffaloIlls,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:49 2015 UTC,I saw someone snipe a Richard Sherman top 10 card today for 101 coins.  People might be trying to unload top 10 collectibles and players
MaddenMobileForums,3cv8x5,Hunter8258,2,Sat Jul 11 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I currently don't have 150k, but I'd buy the graham one and mark it up 50k, lol"

MaddenMobileForums,3cuvbd,vollkoemmenes,3,Fri Jul 10 23:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the actual price for Pouncey SHOULD be, but it damn well isn't between 700k - 1.5 mil.   At this point in the game OVR is what matters most (for season score and the reset). Sometimes you'll see people try to sell a card for higher than its worth just because it's rare (or there aren't a lot in the AH). I don't mean to screw anyone over who is trying to sell one of these Pouncey's, but that price is ridiculous.  Wait it out and see if the price drops. If it doesn't, then move on to a different center. I'd rather spend 2.3 mil on Webster (best center in the game) than 1.5 mil on Pouncey."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvbd,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:45 2015 UTC,I figured maybe 50k since hes a 92 elite og but damn i might just swap him for my 88 vasquez i just opened
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvbd,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 10 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"There's one up that started at a 25k bid (currently at 67,500). There's another up for 100k bid. The buy now prices suck, but the bids aren't all that bad. The reason elite OG prices are higher is because of the PHs. Even after no new releases, people are trying to maximize profit of players. Kyle Long is still the best OG in the game.  I'd try bidding on Pouncey instead of buying him now. You probably won't find any good BIN prices."
MaddenMobileForums,3cuvbd,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 10 23:48:50 2015 UTC,No i have him i was going to sell him to buy another toty pack nd swap him with vasques 88ovr

MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,bran861,2,Fri Jul 10 17:20:47 2015 UTC,What do your offense and defense go to with gc Ryan? Sick team btw. Would Atwater be an improvement over Lott?
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 16:29:24 2015 UTC,Since Z and I have the same team now I can answer this. Jon Ryan make OVR go down. Atwater is an upgrade to Lott. =)
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,awesom567,2,Fri Jul 10 16:33:45 2015 UTC,I thought Lott was rated higher.

MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Sat Jul 11 20:24:38 2015 UTC,Na I talked to some guy in whatever the hell that super rich league is and apparently Atwater is a little better for OVR. Might be another error in the spreadsheet...
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,BenjimanWa,2,Fri Jul 10 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"Given his rarity and that he's in the 30 mil range, probably not happening. I'd rather blow what I have left on MM Rice if I can. Would it be an upgrade for me to add NTL, move Dom to the Nickel or Dime, and drop Woodson or Kam?"
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,HMONEY04,2,Fri Jul 10 17:16:39 2015 UTC,The setup you have right now is maximized for OVR. You do have a bit of wiggle room if you want to shift things around for better gameplay.   I swapped Vontae for NTL. You probably can't drop Woodson since he's second best for OVR. I think you can swap Kam for PH Harrison if you want a tall safety with better coverage stats.
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,EK22,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"Nah, in the Dime I'd rather have the speed boost from Kam. I'm more concerned about the corner spots. I know Dom Sherman is not rated quite as high as a player, so I thought it might be good to get him in the Nickel or Dime, but that would mean dropping Woodson, Lott or Kam.  Also, on Atwater, I see where the spreadsheet is throwing me off. He is third at Free Safety, and better than Lott when Lott is evaluated at Free Safety. But at Strong Safety Lott is rated higher than what Atawater is listed as at Free Safety, and it does not show how Atwater would be rated as a Strong Safety."
MaddenMobileForums,3ct9yt,EK22,2,Fri Jul 10 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem might be that Lott is a FS, while Lott is SS, so there's not really a standard rating for safeties as of now.  Most FS boost higher than SS's though"

MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,skinsballr,3,Fri Jul 10 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"I've played with a lot of top-end receivers (not MM's Fitzgerald/Steve Largent/Jerry Rice/FE Antonio Brown), and I've found that this Dez is the BEST receiver, in my opinion; his deep-ball separation from cornerbacks is the best out of all receivers I've used (like PH Julio Jones/MM Calvin Johnson/MM Plaxico Burress/Cover Vote OBJ/Easter Andre Reed/Super Bowl Deion Branch/Super Bowl Isaac Bruce)"
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:12:00 2015 UTC,For OVR Dez is 5th best according to the published formulas https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3BTvZk8OPWgHhdbMceNbgxUbsLlPXbsC9U_FTPrR8k/edit#gid=1260648375  In game experiments seem to indicate that he might actually rank ahead 4th ahead of FE Brown for OVR though.  In terms of gameplay... well that will depend heavily on how you utilize your receivers...
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,kwrocket,2,Fri Jul 10 22:03:17 2015 UTC,somehow you have to factor height into who actually is best for gameplay.
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:21 2015 UTC,Yea EA doesn't account for height in their OVR formula but there are other spreadsheets with weights for gameplay that factor height.  I think the importance of height is also largely a function of gameplay style. My favorite receivers are the short fast guys but I never throw them lobs...
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,kwrocket,2,Fri Jul 10 23:25:23 2015 UTC,Interesting. I can't see making any short guy work in WR2 and I like to have someone who can block in the flex.
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:30:11 2015 UTC,Yea lately I've been playing a TE in Flex which is working well. My WR2 is Fitz. He's not super short but I don't bother bombing it to him.
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,kwrocket,2,Fri Jul 10 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"I've found that Demariyus Thomas, MM Calvin and MM Plaxico are all good blockers and good in the flex too. They are all better run blockers than MM Gates and even Sharpe."
MaddenMobileForums,3cugyk,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yea I've heard good things about them, also FB VJax. I'm using a TE (MM Winslow) mainly for the OVR boost. I was pleasantly surprised that he played well too though. IMO MM Ditka was terrible..."

MaddenMobileForums,3csu0c,Ryan5427,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is that ranking is based on total number of wins.  There was a time when the wall was 50-1 and Madden Elite was 48-0 and ME was still behind.  As long as the Wall didn't lose again, there was no way to catch up.    The rankings should probably change to include win/loss percentage and tie break (if needed) based on number of wins.  So 49-0 would be better than 51-1, but 51-1 would be better than 50-1 etc."
MaddenMobileForums,3ct500,Reereez95,6,Fri Jul 10 15:47:26 2015 UTC,To answer question 2: I accidentally bought a premium pack for this year and next.  You just get an extra pack of that type when the new season starts.  IMHO save your money for something better

MaddenMobileForums,3ct500,Stuchu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know why those packs cost cash instead of coins. Probably cause they said cash is the only thing that will carry over into the next season."

MaddenMobileForums,3ct3xt,Roger2MMGuy,2,Fri Jul 10 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"Good point. The only reason I was considering Landry was that the Dime covers the TE. So a high STR, high HTP player might jar the ball loose more often against TEs."
MaddenMobileForums,3ct3xt,BenjimanWa,3,Fri Jul 10 16:06:55 2015 UTC,I prefer the awr boost and the coverage stats allow for less catches anyways if he's in the TEs face but let's be honest... The good TES are catching the ball

MaddenMobileForums,3cr19a,kendallfriesen,-1,Fri Jul 10 02:18:48 2015 UTC,50k seems to be a good price for the three hard to get ones. I sold over a hundred of them last time Gridirons dropped.
MaddenMobileForums,3crirx,turkmileymileyturk,3,Fri Jul 10 04:51:46 2015 UTC,I'm not the best with this but this might help.
MaddenMobileForums,3crirx,DrKoooolAid,2,Fri Jul 10 11:09:24 2015 UTC,"Brooks is your best. Stick him on the right side. I'd put Levy on your left, then Collins in the 3-4."
MaddenMobileForums,3crirx,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 10 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"The game doesn't line the defense up consistently, in season mode they line them up one way but then in h2h they appear to line them up a different way so tough to pick sides for the LBs and DEs.  MM Brooks is a keeper for sure one of the best LBs along with LT, but they have different play characteristics. Put Brooks in the leftmost spot on the lineup screen, (LT would go on the opposite side if you had him).  I would probably go with Levy in the rightmost spot and then Collins in the 3/4 spot, but you could probably flip-flop those two with minor affect on gameplay. Upgrade your Kuechly if you can, unless you're a big fan of him. The Frozen 99 Lambert can be had for just over 300k and you can probably build the PH Demarco set for just over that."

Obviously the rare MMs are still selling at insane prices lol. A Vjax sold for 30 mill and a Rice sold for 36 mill lol. Any players your on the watch for? Or is your legacy team complete?

Maybe MM Winslow, but I have only seen one on the market and while I could afford it, I am not yet willing to pay that much for him. There might be others in the coming weeks, like MM NTL.

MaddenMobileForums,3cojgo,apollonese,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:41 2015 UTC,LT is probably more obtainable. I don't see Munoz going below 5 mil. LT you might get for about 3 mil.

MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,joey_34,3,Thu Jul 9 16:02:42 2015 UTC,When did he go for that much?
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,Hunter8258,3,Thu Jul 9 16:53:49 2015 UTC,Right after he came out. It was around the coin glitch time.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,DrKoooolAid,3,Thu Jul 9 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"i don't know. i tried selling him for like 500k but he never sold after like 3 tries. So i just put a random high number and it was bought, during the sb promo"
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,joey_34,3,Thu Jul 9 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Suh MM in a pro pack is my legacy pull
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,apollonese,3,Thu Jul 9 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I played from Sept-Feb and then just started playing again about a month ago. My best pack pull was probably TOTW Suh back when he first came out. He was the best DT in the game at the time. Had to pull a little over a million worth of packs to get him.  I've pulled somewhere between 30 and 50 million in Pro Packs and well over 100 Legend Packs. Never once pulled a single Legend or Legend Rookie. Still have a 104/104/101 team without Dom Sherman."
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,DrKoooolAid,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:42 2015 UTC,Mine would probably be the base 85 MM Watt card just a couple days ago in a 2 mil pack opening after my like 10th pack.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,DookyButter,3,Thu Jul 9 16:08:54 2015 UTC,Yesterday I pulled MM Jerry Rice who I sold for 36 mil and my first pack this morning had a FE Eddie Lacy hidden in there.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,VivaciousFart,3,Thu Jul 9 16:30:12 2015 UTC,MM Ronnie Lott
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,shaydoe,3,Thu Jul 9 16:39:44 2015 UTC,99 FE Nick Mangold from a pro pack. It was a glorious day.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,3,Thu Jul 9 16:50:48 2015 UTC,Gene Upshaw in a pro pack
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,Xrtcoletrain,3,Thu Jul 9 16:54:10 2015 UTC,95 Rod Woodson back in the day of the coin glitch. Sold him for 4 million.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,cheesypie777,3,Thu Jul 9 17:09:41 2015 UTC,Mean Joe when he first came out. Then a whole bunch of shit for the next 3 months
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,UffaloIlls,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:27 2015 UTC,Pulled MM Munoz and Ray Lewis in the same Legend pack..
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,StanleyTheBugman,2,Thu Jul 9 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"MM Mike Webster. I think it was from a Pro Pack, although it might have been a Legends Pack.  Just kidding, nothing good ever comes from Legends Packs."
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,GiveMeSomeIhedigbo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"By best pulls are Bo Jackson from a snowman pack which I later sold for about 20 mil, as well as getting 99 Demario Murray in a pro pack which I sold for 8.75 mil, and my most recent amazing pulls we're getting Tom Brady and gronk rookie in back to back packs, combined I sold those two for 7 mil"
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,patsman101,3,Fri Jul 10 11:44:56 2015 UTC,It would be MM Gronk for me. This was recent too. I was able to sell him for 1.75 mil.
MaddenMobileForums,3coqod,ZtheT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:15 2015 UTC,MM Vick in a Pro Pack the day he released and was going for near 100 mil. Didnt sell him tho cuz im dumb

MaddenMobileForums,3cqmjz,theskyhooker,2,Fri Jul 10 00:26:00 2015 UTC,He and Trent Williams are the two best.

MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,apollonese,2,Thu Jul 9 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"not sure how he stacks up, depends on ur team - but you should be able to get just over a mil for him"
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,Hunter8258,2,Thu Jul 9 19:25:21 2015 UTC,I need to go buy a pro pack
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,EK22,2,Thu Jul 9 19:34:40 2015 UTC,How are the pro packs giving so many people such great stuff? I've opened like 35 in the last few days and haven't even gotten an elite
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,3,Thu Jul 9 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Sell him, Murray, and Lynch. Use the money to get Bo and make PH Miller to block for Bo in the flex spot."
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,Reereez95,2,Thu Jul 9 19:41:11 2015 UTC,Is Bo and Bruce really worth it?
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 9 19:44:22 2015 UTC,Bo is the most well rounded HB in the game. At least a 90 in every major stat category.
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"Bo is second only to Barry Sanders, and being honest here, Sanders is in a cost bracket that is insane. Miller is the best blocker, bar none. Unless you have Bo and Barry, you want a the best blocker."
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,UffaloIlls,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:12 2015 UTC,I'll take your advice considering you have the best team I've ever seen.
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Thu Jul 9 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna pitch for the SB 98hb Franco Harris in the FB spot. Best allround player for that spot, not quite the blocker of Miller but can also run the ball but even better has the hands and can catch out of the backfield. Also 1/2 the price of Miller."
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,UffaloIlls,3,Thu Jul 9 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"also, if you have a fast, outside runner like Bo, Franco can actually keep pace with him.  Miller is too slow to actually be able to block for a fast back like Bo."
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,2,Thu Jul 9 20:09:32 2015 UTC,thats what i was getting at
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 9 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"Ya, you and I are the biggest Franco Supporters on this sub, lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 9 20:12:12 2015 UTC,I was a 96 Fridge supporter until I discovered the 98 Franco. I still haven't sold his card off yet. :)
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,p1ckmatt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:34:10 2015 UTC,u/TheRealFluffy0ne has an even better team. See here:   https://www.reddit.com/r/MaddenMobileForums/comments/3clltg/107_ovr_and_109_defense_accomplished/
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 9 19:53:54 2015 UTC,I don't know man. With Dom Sherman you would win. You have MM Sherman which he doesn't. Does Winslow really make his team better than yours?
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,p1ckmatt,0,Thu Jul 9 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can't have MM Sherman and Dom Sherman. MM Sherman is a better individual player, but Dom Sherman's +5 awareness makes your whole team better. The slot is evaluated as a TE, so Winslow wins out. If I get my hands on MM Rice and Dom Sherman, than I win."
MaddenMobileForums,3cpkt0,ZtheT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"Bo sucked every time I tried him.  He was fast and easily got to the outside, but his trucking is so bad that he never breaks out.  FE lacy, Adrian Peterson, Faulk, and Sanders all play much better than him.  But I don't throw to my hb a lot so that might make a difference"

MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,5,Thu Jul 9 12:21:55 2015 UTC,Hey no problem. When watt came out he was the best but I think they've evolved the 99s
MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,DrKoooolAid,2,Thu Jul 9 12:28:08 2015 UTC,Cool!   Do you happen to know how much a Watt would sell for? :)
MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,theskyhooker,2,Thu Jul 9 12:30:24 2015 UTC,Apparently about 600k. :-)
MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,DrKoooolAid,2,Thu Jul 9 14:19:31 2015 UTC,Thanks bro! Here's hoping I can sell him!
MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,PackersMadden,3,Thu Jul 9 14:59:58 2015 UTC,Check this spreadsheet  JPP is 3rd best in the game. Honers Watt is 7th best.
MaddenMobileForums,3co2b4,turkmileymileyturk,2,Thu Jul 9 12:15:55 2015 UTC,Damn! I guess that was easy! Thanks!

MaddenMobileForums,3cnan6,JacobKHD,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess it's different for different people. I've gotten one elite from it. I've gotten about a dozen from Flashback, and 6-8 from Rising Stars."
MaddenMobileForums,3cnan6,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 9 15:39:20 2015 UTC,I've never gotten any from flashback lol. Flashback is pretty much the best so your lucky.

MaddenMobileForums,3clltg,crazykik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"Kam is at SS for gameplay. After the update where defensive backs play much more physical he is one of the high end safeties (besides the very expensive MM Atwater) who can challenge a large TE for possession. For OVR purposes Woodson > Lott > Kam. However, nickel and dime seem to be evaluated as safeties. So you get the same OVR benefit no matter how your safeties are placed."

I used a power back (FE Morris) forever, and I never understood everybody's complaints about the stiff arm truck, and saying it lasts too long.

Occasionally, you get that perfect thing where he just slides under the tackler's armpit, but most of the time he just trucks too slow and gets tackled."

I've found that since the update, the AH doesn't obey that rule anymore. This happens more with individual, higher OVR cards (not with other players or collectibles). Sometimes a really good deal for a card will drop 3 minutes after a previous round of snipes.  Just a question I had. People should really take note of this thread!!"
MaddenMobileForums,3clsbh,Reereez95,3,Wed Jul 8 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I think that post-update the refresh batch times are a bit off like you said, but I think that if you're a beginner, to keep it simple, 5 min batch drops are constant. I think what youre talking about in terms of the batches dropping after only 3min is what's known as double-dropping where 2 batches drop instead of one. For example, if one batch drops at 00:00/00:05  and another at 00:02/00:07, it would appear that the time in between snipes was reduced to only 3 min between the 00:02 and 00:05 times.  Edit: Yeah, I checked, and I think that's what's happening. Maybe someone else can confirm.  And yeah, I was channeling you when I wrote this.

MaddenMobileForums,3clsbh,ZtheT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"On most days, it still is every 5 minutes. However, every so often, there is what is called double drops. This has been the case for months. My best guess is that EA needs to refresh something. In every case I have seen, the double drops are gone by the next morning. What seems to be happening is instead of everything being released at the first refresh time, only a portion is, and about a minute later, the rest pops out. So, it's 2 times (double drops) every 5 minutes."
MaddenMobileForums,3clsbh,ZtheT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:49 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, it seems sold cards are mixed with 1/2 of the batch and the other 1/2 is on a ""different page.""  It's weird."

MaddenMobileForums,3clxc5,kwrocket,5,Wed Jul 8 22:54:41 2015 UTC,"Basically any route except deep lobs.  Slants, curls, screens, post routes, etc.  Just don't send them on fade routes or streaks and you should be fine."
MaddenMobileForums,3clxc5,theskyhooker,3,Wed Jul 8 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"To add to this, only receivers with exceptional JMP, STR and CIT should be given deep lobs. As exemplified by FB Vincent Jackson, slower (but stronger) receivers can exploit faster, instinctual DBs. If you send a tall receiver out on a deep route and the DB sticks to him, you will more than likely turn over the ball/"
MaddenMobileForums,3clxc5,Reereez95,3,Wed Jul 8 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on:  (1) How fast they are (SPD, ACC and ELU)  (2) How high they can jump  (3) How good they are at catching the ball  The height of a receiver can inhibit their ability on the field, but every now and then a receiver breaks that mold.  The best example of this is FB Devin Hester (+1 AGI). At 5'11"", Hester does not seem like the ideal receiver to have in your line-up. However, certain measurables separate him from the stereotypical short receiver.  He has 99 SPD, 97 AGI, 99 ACC, 95 AWR, 99 ELU, 99 BCV, 98 SPM and 99 JKM... Yikes!! Now, I did say that a receivers' catching ability and jumping ability also determine whether height will be a factor. Hester is an exception to that rule. His 92 CAT, 91 CIT, 89 SPC and 94 JMP are less than stellar, but his high stats negate the effects of his low stats.   I use Hester on plays like PA HB Curl. I put him in the spot where he'll be running the deep route. After the fake hand-off to the HB, I start to run towards the line of scrimmage with my QB. Once I get near the L.O.S., I lob the ball into the air for Hester using MM Vick (it's an added bonus if I get one of the LBs and DBs to bite on my run to the L.O.S.). Hester is so fast and elusive, he outruns the defensive backs to catch the deep ball. Even when the CB or S is right on top of him, he can make that contested catch every now and then.  So I guess the real key when it comes to any player in the game is the match up. Ask yourself: how does my player match up against another player? There's no exact science; it's a lot of trial and error. Short receivers are not the best option on offense, but as Julian Edelman proved in the Super Bowl, every player has a chance to be incredible (this does not apply to most bronze or silver players)."

You can also ask about a player here if you're not sure.  Myself and many of the other guys have tried most of the top players so we know who is best for OVR.

MaddenMobileForums,3cm5o0,afxdub,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"Can you make Combine Warrior Milliner?  That would be a ""free"" upgrade.    Maybe make PH JPP."
MaddenMobileForums,3cm5o0,UltraVioletDoge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"Jason PP PH.  Also get rid of your safeties in the nickel and dime spot. Chris Harris Jr. TOTY, Joe Haden TOTY, Richard Sherman TOTW and Vontae Davis FO are some higher overall/lower priced players if avoiding draft players."
MaddenMobileForums,3cm5o0,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"Safeties rate better for your overall in the Nickel and Dime slots than CBs so you should really move Kevin Johnson to the Dime and keep the AWR boost. Make sure you have a good cover Safety in the Nickel (high Man & Zone, speed, accel, awr, lower tackle) and get a CB upgrade for the CB2 spot. The 96 Vontae Davis FO sounds like a good option or chance it that that you'll finish the Dom Sherman set soon."
MaddenMobileForums,3cly86,zaalp,5,Wed Jul 8 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you shouldn't use the Legend Darrelle Revis card. When you look that card up in the AH, it appears as a NY Jets card, not a Patriots card. So you should use the 93 Football Outsiders edition instead.  BUT if you are going to use the Legend Darrelle Revis card (which is totally fine), then you should use the 94 Malcolm Brown instead of Sealver Siliga. Though the Brown card qualifies as a draft card and is not linked to any specific team, it's all semantics. Brown was drafted by the Patriots and would be much better for your team than Siliga.   On S/T you should have: Gostkowski, Slater, Ryan Allen and Julian Edelman (PR).   This sounds like a fun team to build, and I wish you the best of luck!!"
MaddenMobileForums,3cly86,Reereez95,3,Wed Jul 8 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"I agree about the Legend Darrelle Revis.  For example, I don't play FB Djax on my all-Redskins team.  However, I disagree about the draft players.   Though the Brown card qualifies as a draft card and is not linked to any specific team   That's not true.  If you search by team, Brown comes up as a Patriot.  They linked the draft players to the teams who drafted them.  For this reason, I allow Scherff on my all-Skins team, and would allow Brown on his Pats lineup."

If I'm building an all-Pats team, I wouldn't include Domination Sherman. But if I wanted this team to be competitive? I would put in Dom Sherman. If I really want it to be competitive, I would cheat an put the Legend Darrelle Revis (NYJ) in instead of the FO Darrelle Revis (NE).  Whatever you decide to do, DO NOT get rid of Domination Sherman. If you don't want him in your all-Pats line-up, keep him on the bench. I'm pretty sure you know to do this already, but I felt a need to remind you not to quicksell him. Sadly, he's un-auctionable."

MaddenMobileForums,3cly86,gregs76,3,Thu Jul 16 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno how much coin you have, but there are some good cheap alternatives.  SB Brady is also a 99 and goes for around 2 million less.  MVP Gronk is only a 94 but boosts to 96 with mankin's +2 strength and boosts Edelman to 98 with +2 catching, so those are cheaper yet still good options.  I know Hightower used to be crazy for a guy who's only 87 do it might be worth grabbing his 82 if his price is still around 200k.  Also for gameplay I liked Asante more than Revis so I put him at cb1.  Definitely use Malcolm Brown at DT."

MaddenMobileForums,3ckiar,zaalp,2,Wed Jul 8 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I just was typing a very long, detailed comment when I accidentally clicked the little ""X"" on the page's tab. I was looking at another page and accidentally closed the reddit page trying to click on it. I hate when that shit happens.  Anyways, I'm not going to retype the whole damn thing. Here is a summary of what I was saying:  1st suggestion: Don't spend money on any app.  Everyone will have their own opinion, and I respect people who choose to spend money on IAPs because they view it as paying for entertainment. That being said, I do not like spending money on IAPs because I don't feel like they last long enough to warrant monetary value.  When I was younger, I blew $50 worth of iTunes money refilling my energy bar in Mafia Wars. That pretty much ended any chance of me spending money on IAPs. I downloaded and opened over 1000 apps from TapJoy just to earn enough ""bucks"" in Jurassic Park Builder to buy the T-Rex (special dinosaur you couldn't spend coins on). Completely worth it in my mind.   The high turnover rate of cards in Madden Mobile makes it not worth it to spend money on the game. One moment you have the best card in the game, and 3 weeks later it's 2nd or 3rd at its position. Early on better cards were released slower, but lately EA releases a new ""best card in the game"" every week. There are over 75 different 99 OVR cards in the game... and one of them is now RGIII. Don't spend money on Lacy.  2nd suggestion: Wait for Lacy's price to drop.  Murray, Lynch, Bell and Emmitt Smith are all 99 overall HBs that are priced below 1 million coins. FB Faulk and Legend Payton are both priced at just a hair over 1 million. None of these cards are selling for their current prices (unless they have a 100 starting bid). If anyone wants to actually make coins off of Lacy's card, they'll drop his prices.   Lacy is far from the best 99 HB in the game. Even when comparing him to other 99 HBs, some of his stats don't quite measure up. A lot can depend on how much he contributes to OVR, which DeadToWrite's spreadsheet will probably say in a day or two.  So I'd start saving up coins, but don't worry about his current prices. They will drop.  If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me. I have some coin making tips too if you need any help. Best of luck trying to get Lacy!!"

MaddenMobileForums,3cjrj3,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jul 8 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"It's when someone looks at the market and prices it lower than the lowest one on the market. And, sometimes, it's a large undercut, other times just 1k. And, it becomes a bit of a domino effect where undercutting happens to others who undercut, lowering the market. But it does make sense at times. But I see people miss out on good profit all of the time because they do it when it doesn't make sense."
MaddenMobileForums,3cjrj3,ArianaGranDeez,2,Wed Jul 8 14:14:21 2015 UTC,I post things all the time at an undercut price just because I prefer the quick sell rather than waiting.

I've seen something that is worth in the neighborhood of 100-125k drop down to 50k-75k because of undercutting dominoes. A few hours later, I still sell mine for 100-125k. I am in no rush to spend the coins, so I'd much rather max profit. For me, it's not about how quick it will sell, but how realistically it is that it will sell at my price."

MaddenMobileForums,3cjl4y,patsman101,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:18 2015 UTC,I dont know why you would judge a snipe by the ratio of the buying price to the selling price. If i buy a card for 1000 and sell it for 7000 after tax that is a 1:7 ratio. Meanwhile if I buy an MM brady for 1000000 and sell it for 5000000 thats a ratio of 1:5
MaddenMobileForums,3cjl4y,L0L0L0L0L0L0L0L0L0L,2,Wed Jul 8 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"The amount of time it would take to snipe and sell those 1k cards to make 4 million, IMO, makes that MM Brady far superior.

MaddenMobileForums,3ck9fj,ChasinPatMan,4,Wed Jul 8 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"Could you post a picture of this card? I'm not familiar with the Odell Beckham Jr. rookie card.  [EDIT]: From what I could see on the Madden Mobile player database, I'm assuming you're talking about the signature rookie Odell card, which is a 71 OVR silver. While in most circumstances I imagine people would pay you pretty well for this kind of card, I don't believe you will field very many good offers.   At this point in the game, something like the rarity of a card doesn't matter as much if it is not a high OVR card. With the reset imminent, people who plan to continue playing Madden Mobile are likely loading their rosters to improve their season score. So I think you might be a victim of circumstance here."

I had a chance to get him but I blew it. I could have afforded the card had I not spent 175k coins on the Super Bowl Earl Thomas. Oh well.  I was also trying to get Walter Jones, but his prices spiked towards the end of the Madden 25 app's tenure. This is why my OT and HB flex are so weak. I settled for the Final Edition Frank Gore instead.  It was a little known secret that FO Keenan Allen was the best WR in the game. He'd blow past DBs untouched and real in deep passes for huge gains.   My defense is my pride and joy. The only cards I didn't get that I wanted were Single Season Legend Charles Woodson, Legend Deion Sanders, Ghost of Madden Past Reggie White and Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith. All of those were unrealistic. Otherwise I was happy (I liked ET3 and Gipson because they had high MAN for safeties)."

His +2 strength boost proves to be very valuable:  http://imgur.com/DPPzJOd  I'm a huge proponent of boosting and actively use it in my drives.

I feature Captain Logan Mankins on my boosting offense because he give +2 STR to Jamie Collins. It's the same reason I feature Team MVP Jon Asamoah; I used to have MM Deion Sanders in my line-up.

MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Tue Jul 7 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Your team's pretty good. The only trouble for you is that EA has gone on a binge lately with 99 OVR Mobile Masters. It seems like each new MM is suddenly the best at its position. You (and everyone else) are a victim of circumstance (and stupidly high prices).  I feel like not a lot of people played the Madden 25 app. Or at least those that did play on the app don't play on Madden Mobile. Especially towards the end (before they cut the servers) it felt like there was no one on the app anymore.   Madden 25 had a wider selection of legends, and that's probably my favorite part of the game."

MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Stuchu,2,Tue Jul 7 23:13:59 2015 UTC,"I really wanted Keenan for the longest time. He had OP stats. I settled for Cruz and Patterson because they were the only cheap WRs with 99 speed. The next cheapest was Larry fitz and he was unattainable. I also wanted to get 99 P Manning who has +1 overall boosting, but as you probably know, he was incredibly expensive."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Stuchu,2,Wed Jul 8 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all the elites at each position (with the +1 boosts) were insanely expensive. And at the time, it was difficult to make a lot of coins in Madden.  What's also weird is the classification of cards in Madden 25 versus Madden Mobile. In Madden 25, the cards were bronze, silver, gold and Ultimate. Ultimate is the equivalent of Mobile's elite. In Madden 25, elite referred to the green fringed cards with the +1 boosts to a stat category (i.e. Peterson, Manning, Malcolm Smith, etc).  Now in Madden Mobile, you have card types likes Game Changers, Team MVPs, Mobile Masters, etc. Another difference between Mobile and Madden 25: in M25, all boosts applied to every player on your team. It was only in Madden Mobile that they introduced team specific boosts (i.e. Captain Logan Mankins can only give +2 STR to other NE players)."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Stuchu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:07 2015 UTC,whats weirder in Madden mobile vs MM25 is how the elites are ranked. For example there are elites right now that are <90 overall and there are golds >90 overall. This took some time for me to get used to.
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the Madden 25 app, card tiers were restricted to OVR ranges. So the 40, 50 and 60 range OVRs were bronze, the 70s were silver, the 80s were gold and the 90+ cards were Ultimate. Elites were (usually) the best player at each position, with some sort of team stat boost.   What I liked about Madden Mobile was that you started out with lower OVR players. As a Boston Sports fan, I picked the Patriots as my team. In Madden 25, you'd start out with all Patriots players (i.e. Tom Brady, Gronk, etc.), but they'd all be weaker starter versions of the higher OVR cards. In Madden Mobile, it doesn't matter what team you pick. You'll always start out with some sort of amalgamation of lower OVR players (many of which people have never heard of). I thought that was better than giving people lower OVR versions of better players."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"What's interesting about MM25 is how they edited the base rankings. For example, when you scouted the teams during solo challenges, they often used base players but made them crazy good. I remember doing one challenge where the Base AP had been boosted to 110 overall. That was pretty cool to see."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"Wtf? 110 overall!? That's insane!!!  I totally forgot that you could boost players to higher OVRs than just 99 (meaning the OVR # actually rose, instead of individual stats only rising)."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"I dont think you could boost players higher than 99, but the AI teams could.  I think the computer just took the Base AP and increased stats and overall.  The rest of the team sucked to compensate of course, but if you played that event and didnt run a goalline defense for the entire game, you were fucked."

MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:00 2015 UTC,MM25 was the best imo. Can't wait to play MM in the begining where it's all a challenge and hustle to get coins. Hopefully EA fixes this autotouch exploit soon.

I saved up forever to get him because I'm a die hard bills fan and he's my all time favorite.   I didnt know about Muthead then, so I only knew about players I saw on the AH..."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Stuchu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:21:03 2015 UTC,Same here I didn't know anything about the game until this year
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Fri Jul 10 00:50:45 2015 UTC,"It's so much fun talking about madden 25! It was a fun app.  Funny thing is that I didn't know about force-closing until Madden Mobile. So now I know why I lost to this one guy all the time. I also know how he drove up the field for 100 yards in 5 plays... with 2 seconds left when I was kicking the ball to him...   Another thing I just remembered: H2H games were more like actual games instead of match ups. Rather than having 3 drives each, both players played four 2 min 30 sec quarters. Punting was relevant then.  One thing I also miss about the old H2H: fake punt plays. I used to burn opponents all the time with those plays. My punter had pretty damn good accuracy throwing the ball, and Single Season Legend Dwight Freeney had pretty damn good hands catching it  :)"
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Stuchu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"fake punts were the bomb. Also, the market was so weird because the green elite cards cost so much money (I could only afford one and it was the most expensive card in my lineup). Legends however were pretty cheap and had epic stats. I made my money by creating alt accounts on different devices. There was this solo challenge for the christmas promo that gave out 10k on the first win and a pack with a guaranteed christmas legend. The event was glitched tho, so it gave out 20k and 2 packs (doubling the awards).  Also, the AI was so easy to beat, even though the challenge pitted you against a 90 overall team, you could easily win on an alt (all you needed was a cheap HB and TE). Then I'd drop one of the legends into the collection that gave out 40k plus a guaranteed ultimate player. Basically I could keep doing these christmas collections and get free players/coins (the collections were more often than not more profitable than the AH) and I'd earn 100s of thousands in an hour. It was so fun."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,2,Wed Jul 8 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"Dang!! Talk about money making! I wasn't aware of alt accounts in Madden 25. Tbh, I wasn't really aware of anything until Madden Mobile. Funny thing too is that I struggled against teams in season mode (or whatever the hell that was where you played the last 8 games of a team's season). Some teams were just impossible for me to beat.  The legends were oddly cheap, considering some of them were really good. The one legend that never fell in price was Single Season Legend Charles Woodson (and for good reason). That card consistently stayed at 1 million coins, and there was no way in hell I was ever going to be able to afford it."
MaddenMobileForums,3cg7wr,Reereez95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"yeah the market was so odd. there would be some 90 overall cards being sold for millions of coins and some legends 99 and up sold for 30k. It was insane. If you had 15mil in that game, you could probably afford the entire AH.  I personally stopped playing season mode because it was pretty hard. Also, if I remember correctly, the reward was pretty low. One thing I loved about MM25 were the solo challenge rewards. Unlike live events, solo challenges only came out like once a week, but they gave out rewards as big as 10k if you did them on the day they came out. 10k was a heck of a lot of money back then especially considering how crappy live events are now.  Also, I really liked the ones that guaranteed a special player. It made wasting stamina worth it if you could work your way towards some 90+ overall player at some point.  Also some of the collections were awesome, like the OOP one where you could put Blanda and the fridge and some other OOP players and get a ghost legend. the great thing about that collection was how you got the players you put into it back, so you could resell and make so much profit."
MaddenMobileForums,3chbaa,maddenmaster,2,Tue Jul 7 22:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say that's a good price. Unless his prices are suddenly falling.  I purchased one for 1.5 mil buy now the other day. I jumped on that cause I saw him sell for >1.6 mil just before.  It's a good pull and Brooks is a good player. Solid win."
MaddenMobileForums,3ch6zq,kl1513,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:35 2015 UTC,"MM Lambert is better for OVR than MM Ray Lewis. Even so, here's a comparison of the two:  http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/6137/6202  I do not have either player, so anything I say is not coming from experience. Overall, Lambert appears to be better defensively. When it comes to general stats, Ray Lewis appears to be more physically gifted than Lambert. Neither has very good jumping ability, so Lambert's height gives him a slight advantage. Lambert also has the best play recognition (101 PLR) of any player in Madden Mobile.  My opinion: both are great ILBs and I'd be happy to have either one. I would put Ray Lewis at the 3-4 LB spot and start Lambert at starting MLB."
MaddenMobileForums,3ch6zq,Reereez95,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:59:34 2015 UTC,Luckily I have both of them. Lewis at 3-4 and Lambert as starting MLB. I don't know how to describe / compare their playmaking ability because I usually don't control them. But if the CPU runs though the middle in season mode Lambert is pretty fast to close the holes. And in coverage lambert has made some picks even when I failed to swipe up and get the interception bonus. So in my opinion Lambert over Lewis and you should try to pick up both :)

MaddenMobileForums,3cebhy,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jul 7 15:48:26 2015 UTC,Yah I guess. I spent upwards of 20 mill on pro packs. Just turned gold players into the 10 trophy pack. Probably woulda been better to sell golds lol.

MaddenMobileForums,3cexiw,ZtheT,3,Tue Jul 7 11:25:28 2015 UTC,It's because EA wants you to spend your money on the now/later pack bundle. I'f there were legend bundles it would discourage you from buying the now /later bundle.
MaddenMobileForums,3cexiw,NakedTaco,2,Tue Jul 7 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"Probably so, but not wise. EA should just want to make money, and some people are not going to buy that crappy pack anyway."

MaddenMobileForums,3cexiw,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jul 7 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"I am one away as well. I was hoping for MM Rice, but my best bet might be a Pro Pack run as well. I have enough coins to build on, but he's like a ghost. I saw him once and he was more than I could afford at the time."
MaddenMobileForums,3cexiw,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jul 7 15:18:54 2015 UTC,I got 30ish mill ready to pounce on the first MM rice I see or a V-jax for 20 mill or less!
MaddenMobileForums,3cexiw,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jul 7 16:11:20 2015 UTC,If you see one. The one I saw was less and wad at 11 mil in a bidding war with 6 minutes to go.
MaddenMobileForums,3ceu30,Thefriendthatraps,2,Tue Jul 7 10:40:26 2015 UTC,Make a fake Facebook and use that.
MaddenMobileForums,3ccdvm,ZtheT,5,Mon Jul 6 20:33:40 2015 UTC,Damn nice. That's what's been happening to me as well lol. I got FE mangold for 500k and a MM upshaw for 1.3 mill. The Bots are after the rookies and set legends! :)
MaddenMobileForums,3ccdvm,BenjimanWa,2,Mon Jul 6 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My best snipes come when I am chasing what is not the hot item at the moment.

MaddenMobileForums,3ce321,Kyleg50,2,Tue Jul 7 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"considering the next cheapest on the market right now is 300k, yes. But there could just be an abnormally low amount on the market at this moment. you could put yours on the market for 295k right now and if someone is looking to purchase morris they'll take yours and youll have an awesome net profit."
MaddenMobileForums,3ce321,mh49,2,Tue Jul 7 04:56:22 2015 UTC,Mine is the one for 300k. I just figured it would sell at that price.
MaddenMobileForums,3ce321,Syth1579,2,Tue Jul 7 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"Try re-selling at around 230-250k and see if there are any takers. If someone buys it, you did good. If not, you may have just overpaid. If someone buys it, see if you can pick up a 98 Marshal Faulk, or the 98 Lynch if you're in need of a HB."
MaddenMobileForums,3ce321,ZtheT,2,Tue Jul 7 04:59:26 2015 UTC,"Compared to the others it seems so, but those are overpriced compared to what he used to be. He really should be in the just under 100k range, but the market has gone mad."

MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,Syth1579,3,Tue Jul 7 00:03:43 2015 UTC,You should pm it to me so that I can test it for everyone else

MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,UffaloIlls,3,Tue Jul 7 00:30:32 2015 UTC,I'd drop it. youre quitting anyway. Is it really that lucrative? and how much starter funds do you need?
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jul 7 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the more the merrier. I'd say about 12k starting, but the process goes faster with the more money you have already."
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,bran861,3,Tue Jul 7 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, then I really want to hear this because, like you, I burned 500k+ on legend packs and got nothing."
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jul 7 00:39:39 2015 UTC,I really want to hear how ZtheT makes his. As a season ending gift I think he should admit his secrets. He said he made 2 million in one day.
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,bran861,2,Tue Jul 7 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've made that much in a day (approx 5 hours) on an alt account. It involved a bunch of luck, so it wasnt very efficient..."
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,onbehalfofreddit,2,Tue Jul 7 00:48:18 2015 UTC,The most I've made is probably 600k. But I can no longer do  guest account farming. For some reason the only option I have now is to log in with Facebook. Creating new emails and face books for it is too much work. Especially when I have 6 account for farming packs.
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,ConfusedAlgerian,2,Tue Jul 7 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"I did 1.5 in a day using my method! most in a week was around 4.7 million, and a grand total of around 26 million. Not bad, I guess."

MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,ZtheT,2,Tue Jul 7 02:24:23 2015 UTC,Damn dude. The best one I've got is an AJ Cann for 101 and sold for 75k.
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,ccubs2015,2,Tue Jul 7 02:25:26 2015 UTC,How do you have time to refresh the AH every 5 minutes?  Isn't there a part of you that feels guilty for wasting that 30 seconds of company time every 5 minutes?  I mean I tried sniping at work a few times in my cube and just felt bad.  Now I resort to the two times a day I retire to the throne and hope the wireless network stays connected so i can a chance at three refreshes.
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,kendallfriesen,3,Tue Jul 7 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"I don't do it every 5 minutes at all times. It depends on the time and what else I have to get done. I get all of my work done and that's my priority. But when it's slow, why not?"
MaddenMobileForums,3cd5ru,awesom567,2,Tue Jul 7 03:10:26 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I am sort of afraid of my boss seeing me and saying you must be able to take on another 400 hour effort... just for messing around on my tablet for 5 mins.  In all honesty my boss has caught me on my tablet more times than i can count and never said a damn word. I agree with your point about the best snipes happening at work.  I know out of our corporate HQ we have a 450Mb connection.  The refreshes are awesome there (when i did snipe a lot).  At home on my 50Mb connection I strike out way more often than not.

MaddenMobileForums,3cdra0,MitchCave,2,Tue Jul 7 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Make every non return team player low OVR players. It will soften the team you play and make it doable.

MaddenMobileForums,3cbdv4,derduc,4,Mon Jul 6 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"But I think scrambling will be possible ... The analog sticks gives you more controls ... First one for direction and second move for speed of the move.  ""When the user takes control of a player, the first analog stick touch sets only the player’s run direction. The second input from the analog stick will be for direction and speed. Instead of stutter steps and poor acceleration, running plays will become smoother and more responsive."""
MaddenMobileForums,3cbdv4,theskyhooker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:33:54 2015 UTC,I think that part was just talking about how the player you were controlling loses all their speed if you touch the analog stick.
MaddenMobileForums,3cbdv4,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jul 6 17:49:46 2015 UTC,so basically they destroyed usering for deep ball ability...

MaddenMobileForums,3cchio,Xrtcoletrain,2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:18 2015 UTC,Jailbroken or Rooted phones use an app called autotouch. With this they record the sniping motion and then they speed it up so it goes really fast and then they let it sit and roll on in the profit.
MaddenMobileForums,3cchio,UltraVioletDoge,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:45:42 2015 UTC,So THATS how people get 106 overall teams

MaddenMobileForums,3cc1zv,JacobKHD,2,Mon Jul 6 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they pick up where they left off, then we have a week and a half before we'll see Gridiron Packs, since they were the last packs before the drought. Legend Packs are the first since. But who knows."

MaddenMobileForums,3cati5,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,2,Mon Jul 6 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"Well, tourneys are league play and it heavily alters the style of play for the opponent defense. You're 106 defense starts really playing like a106 defense on all madden. When you play on rookie a silver WR with 86 speed can burn MM Sherman by a mile. On All Madden even Dez will lose a jump ball to PH Vonte Davis."
MaddenMobileForums,3cati5,Werdna2356,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"So basically, in this scenario my league with everyone of 100+ overalls is at All-Pro difficulty setting and we're playing some other league with lets say 90s overall teams is at Rookie level. Our 100+ offences are playing against their 90s defences with All-Pro AI turned on. But their 90s some offences are playing against our 100+ defences with Rookie level AI turned on?"
MaddenMobileForums,3cati5,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Mon Jul 6 19:40:50 2015 UTC,Yep
MaddenMobileForums,3cati5,NeonClawsOfGamblor,4,Mon Jul 6 20:56:01 2015 UTC,Holy crap you aren't kidding!  I just started a league tournament to test this out and returned a kickoff for a TD.

MaddenMobileForums,3calne,bran861,5,Mon Jul 6 12:13:37 2015 UTC,"it's called a counter, players can set counters to any play in the book (under the strategy tab). If you call a play that another player has countered, you'll get sacked. just pick a play that is more obscure that may not be countered."
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,apollonese,3,Mon Jul 6 12:17:45 2015 UTC,Normally all I run is HB blast and PA streaks. So that's probably it.
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,apollonese,9,Mon Jul 6 12:19:18 2015 UTC,"those are always countered, you gotta get comfortable with the entire playbook"
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,gronky444,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:38:03 2015 UTC,"My advice is get comfortable with a few plays that people generally don't like to call.  First I try off-tackle, and if that doesn't work it's a mix of the following depending on the defensive lineup:  -Singleback or I-form HB Draw  -Pitch (usually countered, but worth a shot if you're ahead of the count so to speak)  -FB DIVE FROM GOAL LINE FORMATION. This one is my new personal favorite.  If it's a good matchup scheme wise and player wise, and you get a feel for the way your guy runs you can get 4-10 most plays, at least 3 the vast majority of the time.  Most importantly, it's rarely countered.  I don't mess around with qb sneaks, I've seen people do that literally an entire drive...I mean I get it that just sounds boring, personally speaking of course.  I'm not a big passer in H2H, especially league/tourneys where the stakes are higher.  If I have to I go with one of the slants, usually the one with the flanker running a curl route. PH Dez and Draft Devante on the right side will get me a crunch time 4th and 8 more than half the time. Fl Drag (the one where the slot does a medium crossing route, not the left outside doing a shallow cross) is also a personal favorite, but more for the nasty wheel route from the HB.  FO JC for life.  Screens are interesting too, but challenging to pull off timing wise.  Even if you get a catch and some open field you could still end up losing one or two which is tremendously frustrating.  Best bet is the shot gun one in my experience.  Finally...SET YOUR COUNTERS KIDS. There's one guy in my league I beat five times in a row in basically two weeks because I would run one or two off-tackles and break it for 80 every time.  He never set them, or any for that matter, which is infuriating in tourneys.  It basically means 24 for the opponent if fumbles don't happen.    My suggestions are whatever the latest trend seems to be (people like flea flicker a lot recently, personally it has only ever worked for me in drills/season.)  But ALWAYS have the big runs countered unless the person clearly doesn't like to run at all, i.e. blast and hb dive weak. If someone is going to get a 90 yard td from the goal line PA-bootleg to the tight end, so be it, I'm not wasting a counter on that.    Just keep playing, and try out new stuff when you're not in h2h, get a feel for how WR's run their routes, how long your guys will generally hold blocks and in what direction, and get REALLY good at a handful of uncommon plays, and DOMINANT at one or two. Savor those times foolish people leave dive weak open in a tourney and you put up 24 in six snaps.   TLDR:  Keep working at new stuff, challenge yourself, don't run obvious stuff, find your style, follow popular trends, and above all SET YOUR COUNTERS.  Don't sweat the petty things, and don't pet the sweaty things is what I've heard."
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,ArianaGranDeez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the FB Dive, its more commonly countered for me, but if it isn't, it's the best 2 point conversion and gets decent yards."
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,UffaloIlls,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:33 2015 UTC,Switch to KGun formation. Running plays from Shotgun is the best way to go (offtackle comes to mind as a play that no one counters)
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,jsight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:31:13 2015 UTC,You aren't kidding about Off-Tackle. It amazes me how few people I see that use that.  It's really nice when you find out someone hasn't countered HB Blast. :)
MaddenMobileForums,3calne,pvt_snowba11,3,Mon Jul 6 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"Trial and error, my friend. The higher level you are will result in playing playing higher level players (which increases the number of potential counters). Think of it this way...your most popular plays are probably other's most popular plays (like HB Blast). You're going to have to practice successfully running less popular plays.   You gotta have a go to play that will bail you out when you run into counters"

MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,westywall,2,Mon Jul 6 14:46:06 2015 UTC,Are you thinking of 94 WR Devin Smith who gives a +1 JMP?
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,westywall,2,Mon Jul 6 15:03:27 2015 UTC,NVM I see who you mean - 94 HB Tevin Coleman.
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 6 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"Also, I rarely use the flex back and offense isn't really my issue at this point.  I just need to eek out the last 2 OVR on the DEF.  Swapping out a player on OFF with the same boost isn't going to really matter."
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,westywall,3,Mon Jul 6 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah FB Laron Landry is my favorite player, get him for sure. I used to start him over 99s, he's an int wizard"

MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,onbehalfofreddit,2,Mon Jul 6 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, whoops the Jaguars Have a player named Telvin Smith, yeah Tevin Coleman"
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,BenjimanWa,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"Get GC Jon Ryan. He boosts awareness by 2 or 3 which might push you over for Offense. It only has to be a momentary raise in level, so if your selling high level cards just place them in your lineup then remove them and sell them."
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,ArianaGranDeez,2,Mon Jul 6 06:06:32 2015 UTC,This is good advice. If it doesn't work get a couple draft players to replace Wilfork or Ware. Swapping Bush in for MJD won't do anything.
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,ryguy0204,3,Mon Jul 6 06:14:05 2015 UTC,Yes it will. Lol speed is one of the best for overall
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,jonnytranftw,2,Mon Jul 6 12:47:02 2015 UTC,"Your special is fine, I reached 100% season score with 94 special; get ET3, he will help boost, and you should upgrade your D-Line CW Poe is great. Also you should upgrade your HB and maybe your TE, Honors Murray is much better than the TOTY one and try getting PH Graham."
MaddenMobileForums,3c9u3e,Robotsaur,2,Mon Jul 6 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Also, ET3 would be a great upgrade, but I'd have to save for a bit or do a ton of flips to get to him..."
MaddenMobileForums,3c8u98,Nomz0,4,Sun Jul 5 23:55:45 2015 UTC,I actually get the LEAST players from RS events. I probably average about 1 player each time the FB and GC events come around. During one GC day I got 3 Jon Ryan's. Wish that had happened 3 months ago.
MaddenMobileForums,3c8u98,afxdub,2,Mon Jul 6 00:30:29 2015 UTC,last week I got two FBs and 1 RS.   Thus week Ofer.
MaddenMobileForums,3c8u98,Why_So-Serious,2,Mon Jul 6 00:41:12 2015 UTC,I got 1 Free agent and 1 RS today.

MaddenMobileForums,3c9bt0,C0812,2,Mon Jul 6 03:02:48 2015 UTC,When did he get that expensive? I really wish I would've waited a month to sell my team.
MaddenMobileForums,3c9bt0,Ryan5427,2,Mon Jul 6 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, great price. Not too long ago the only FB Faulk on the market was 1.5m."
MaddenMobileForums,3c98lc,ArianaGranDeez,2,Mon Jul 6 02:08:06 2015 UTC,I have noticed that he loses almost ever jump ball but if the ball is thrown on a line he is very quick to intercept. For the most part I agree with you.
MaddenMobileForums,3c98lc,Werdna2356,3,Mon Jul 6 02:21:46 2015 UTC,"That probably has to do with height.  Vontae is only 5'11"", and if you're comparing him with Dom Sherman (6'3""), Sherman will be better on the jump balls because of height alone."
MaddenMobileForums,3c98lc,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 6 12:39:39 2015 UTC,"Some do. I for one don't. He is blazing fast and he plays tight. Doesn't wow with ints, but he is shutdown. Never gets burned."

MaddenMobileForums,3c8ubd,Ryan5427,2,Sun Jul 5 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really see any upgrades you could make for 400k.  You could pick up GC Foles, GC Patterson, and Draft Tevin Coleman if you really only care about defense.  In fact, I would say go get Coleman regardless.  I would say he's a more effective fullback and he has a better boost than Yeldon."
MaddenMobileForums,3c8ubd,theskyhooker,2,Mon Jul 6 00:00:47 2015 UTC,I second coleman + 1 spd is good and his basic spd and str are good for blocking as an FB.
MaddenMobileForums,3c8ubd,shinenasty,2,Mon Jul 6 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"The guys you need are out of the 400k conversation. Guys like Ed Reed and Deon Sanders are probably the cheapest we're talking, and they are in the million range."
MaddenMobileForums,3c8ubd,ZtheT,2,Mon Jul 6 01:34:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for breaking my heart </3
MaddenMobileForums,3c8ubd,Reereez95,2,Mon Jul 6 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"If you still believe in boosting this late in the game, then here are some options for when you are on defense:   Replace your OG with Captain Logan Mankins; his +2 STR (to Pats players only) will give Jamie Collins a strength boost Replace Dez with GC Antonio Brown (+2 AGI, -1 TRU). Agility really helps for OVR, so you may want to consider swapping FB Vincent Jackson (+1 STR) with FB Devin Hester (+1 AGI). Hester is a beast in his own right too (I love using him on deep, play action passes). Replace your HB and HB flex positions with FB Reggie Bush (+1 SPD) and Draft Tevin Coleman (+1 SPD), respectively; I don't know how much this will improve your defensive OVR, but it will certainly aid your defense's performance Replace your QB with FB Carson Palmer (+1 AWR); awareness is never bad for OVR   Remember, this would be only for when you're on defense. On offensive drives, you'd switch back to your starting offensive line-up. With 400k, you're no going to get much. You'll still need to build up some coins before significant changes can be made. Here are a list of defensive players who (given the impending reset) are out of your price range (barring you pull one out of a pack):    Mobile Masters JJ Watt Mobile Masters Julius Peppers Mobile Masters John Randle Mobile Masters Ndamukong Suh Mobile Masters Lawrence Taylor Domination Richard Sherman Mobile Masters Richard Sherman   Here are the defensive players that you could realistically acquire before the reset:   Mobile Masters Jack Ham Mobile Masters James Harrison Mobile Masters Ed Reed Easter Rod Woodson Mobile Masters Antonio Cromartie Legend Night Train Lane - there may be a MM version coming out soon, which would make this an even greater possibility   The iffy players are MM Jack Lambert, MM  Ray Lewis, MM Pat Willis (assuming either Lambert or Lewis is too expensive), MM Richard Sherman and MM Derrick Brooks. Depending on the day, any one of these players could be extremely affordable. On the other hand, they could spike in price and be unrealistic to purchase.  Hopefully this helps you out. Sorry for getting here late. Good luck in your quest to improve your defense!"

MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,SackRVC17,2,Sun Jul 5 19:40:10 2015 UTC,if u were able to do the whole team with the best players at every position off:96 def:89 spec. teams:81 ovr:89 and this unboosted u would also have +1cat +1rbk +1str
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,ZtheT,5,Sun Jul 5 19:51:34 2015 UTC,I am sure you can.
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,FIFAforlife735,2,Sun Jul 5 19:20:25 2015 UTC,Just forfeit 8 games in each season and you can get to 20 seasons completed in a few days.
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,theskyhooker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:59:46 2015 UTC,That takes a lot of stamina though.
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,FIFAforlife735,2,Mon Jul 6 00:16:07 2015 UTC,Ik but its the easiest way
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y34,ciesum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you can. I had 101 OVR and made an all 49ers team and i'm only at 91 OVR now. Still at a 100 Season Score, but if I add up all the percentages i'm only at 147% which is lower than it used to be."

MaddenMobileForums,3c7deu,JacobKHD,3,Sun Jul 5 16:24:49 2015 UTC,You should either sell your QB collectibles now or make ph Russell and sell him. Michael Vick should be good enough.
MaddenMobileForums,3c7deu,Werdna2356,3,Sun Jul 5 16:42:35 2015 UTC,Your +1catch players are hurting Dezs 101 catch ability. I know it's silly but the game takes him down to 99 I believe.

MaddenMobileForums,3c7deu,patsman101,3,Sun Jul 5 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"Might think about FB VJax over Jeffrey.  Also, MM Lott for Safety. Move Kam down to dime.   Combine Von Miller is an amazing ROLB. Blitz, blitz, blitz. And put either FO Lavonte David or Honors Thomas Davis at LOLB for their coverage."
MaddenMobileForums,3c7deu,ZtheT,2,Sun Jul 5 16:57:12 2015 UTC,Thanks!
MaddenMobileForums,3c72lk,Dubzil,4,Sun Jul 5 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"Accel, pass block, impact block, run block, and strenghth. Also, you can include awareness but that is not too important"
MaddenMobileForums,3c72lk,patsman101,3,Sun Jul 5 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"TOTY Frederick is awesome. Just have to wait for TOTY packs for his price to drop. Kory Lichestieger MVP is also great if you can create the set.  If you want a good center on the cheap, Gold Frederick is pretty good. Also Gold RTTP de la Puente (sp?) for the Bears is good."
MaddenMobileForums,3c72lk,afxdub,2,Sun Jul 5 14:27:59 2015 UTC,i have the same problem. i would reccomend completing the wahington MVP set
MaddenMobileForums,3c72lk,awesom567,2,Sun Jul 5 14:33:56 2015 UTC,The most expensive card I Chris Chester. He sells for 50k. I just sniped him for 2k and put him up for 40k
MaddenMobileForums,3c72lk,patsman101,2,Sun Jul 5 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton! getting Kory Lichestieger MVP, set total costs about 200k, but player is much better than others i can find around that price."
MaddenMobileForums,3c7y7s,CamGreezy,2,Sun Jul 5 19:12:53 2015 UTC,Not bad. He'll be good in the PH sets.

MaddenMobileForums,3c6z2m,ZtheT,8,Sun Jul 5 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the Rising Stars event doesn't have anything worth playing for. Maybe the Fluker card can go for 25k. But the rest of the cards are kind of useless.  FB at least gives you the chance at 99 Freeney, 99 Faulk, 99 Warner, 98 Woodson, or 98 Reed.  Even the Landry and Wilson cards are very good. I love FB events."
MaddenMobileForums,3c6z2m,afxdub,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:56:46 2015 UTC,Very true. Using my stamina for FB events.
MaddenMobileForums,3c6z2m,theskyhooker,3,Sun Jul 5 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Just like they had two events on Friday, I guess we get two to compensate for the loss of combine events."
MaddenMobileForums,3c6z2m,afxdub,3,Sun Jul 5 14:27:22 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'll have to monitor the market for Combine Player prices. They'll probably start to rise. Particularly the top tier players like Milliner and Robinson.
MaddenMobileForums,3c6z2m,shinenasty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:30:14 2015 UTC,milliner and robinson are top tier? aren't they 98's? guess i got to monitor this market better.

MaddenMobileForums,3c4pli,afxdub,2,Sat Jul 4 20:07:58 2015 UTC,Pretty much any QB or HB set will be cheap. Try to avoid sets that have an Elite OL in the set as those tend to get monopolized.
MaddenMobileForums,3c4pli,Sergatron23,2,Sat Jul 4 20:08:51 2015 UTC,Broncos and Raiders is pretty cheap
MaddenMobileForums,3c5qbf,ncsaints,3,Sun Jul 5 01:49:31 2015 UTC,Id grab a couple legends while they are cheap while packs are out: Mean Joe Greene and Ronnie Lott. That would only put you back about 800K so you would still have 1.2M.
MaddenMobileForums,3c5qbf,bundleofsocks,2,Sun Jul 5 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"Switch Arron Donald for Mean Joe Greene. You can also upgrade Thomas Davis for Justin Huston. You can switch Julio Jones with Megatron (not really that important). For OG, get the positional heroes.   Or for your secondary, the better players would cost more (Lott). So you need to decide if you rather upgrade your offense or defense. If you pick offense, you might have enough money to switch Haden with a 98 cb or safety."

MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,theskyhooker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on your playstyle and your budget.  O-line is one of the most expensive things to upgrade in the game, and if your O-line is weak, MM Brady will get sacked very often.  Also, if you just like to scramble, I think RG3 is the best mobile QB."

MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,Silasco,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:39:58 2015 UTC,Do you think he's the best mobile QB in the game?

MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,theskyhooker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:24 2015 UTC,Ah. Thanks. Thought there would be some way.
MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,jonnytranftw,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"The best way to go if you have Cam (who is right handed, i believe) is to run right and angle yourself with the line of scrimmage in such a way that your directional vector creates an acute angle with the LOS. the shallower the angle, the better. your QB runs faster to their throwing arm side and runs smoother at a shallow angle."
MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,Slendycat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:35:23 2015 UTC,Huh. Will try it out when I get home from watching women's world cup. Thanks for the info!
MaddenMobileForums,3c5jkl,ArianaGranDeez,2,Sun Jul 5 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Vick and RGIII are really similar, but I think I'd take Vick for that little extra speed and better deep ball. I'm running Wilson though, he's a nice mix between speed and throwing but yeah he looks sick."
MaddenMobileForums,3c606d,flickerstick29,3,Sun Jul 5 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"Actually that's pretty smart, my bet is to go for offense players as well. It's the most fun part of the game as well, so I've been trying to upgrade my offense. I would honestly focus on QB/HB/WR/TE the most. Offensive line cost so much to upgrade, especially PH players, but I would say you are on the right track."
MaddenMobileForums,3c606d,xKizume,2,Sun Jul 5 04:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been thinking the same way.  The Legacy events could be ""win in the second half against the insert team"" but 90% of the live events are offense-intensive."
MaddenMobileForums,3c606d,Bar-Tal,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"This is my game plan as well.  I got my team to something like 103/103/99 then realized I don't really need a Punter or defence for live events so sold my 99 Punter and any defensive player worth 99 and replaced them with 45K 95+ overalls.  Pick your favorite playmakers and give them a decent OL and you should be fine.

MaddenMobileForums,3c4e2q,bran861,2,Sat Jul 4 17:51:13 2015 UTC,He's really good for the price tag.

MaddenMobileForums,3c51r5,Degrees_Calvin,7,Sat Jul 4 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"WR 1 - Dez, MM Rice, MM Fitz, MM Largent are all fast, top tier beast WR's. MM Rice is the best I believe but you can get the same gameplay from PH Dez who is much cheaper.  WR 2 - MM Megatron and MM VJax are the best deep ball WR because of their amazing height.  Slot - FE Brown and OBJ are great slot players, fast and agile!  Legend Rice and CW Garcon are good as well, but they aren't the best and get outshines by others.  MM Plaxio and PH Julio are really bad compared to the other WR on the list.  I didn't even know FE Thomas was a card so I can't really say how he fits, but he isn't at the top tier.  If your going for overall it's different but for gameplay I think that this is the best, and if anybody thinks differently about the players I listed I'm sorry. We are all entitled to our own opinions! I am willing to argue however lol."

MaddenMobileForums,3c51r5,Diabolicat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"I rarely use the slot but since the worst secondary is covering the slot, I'd rather have a fast and quick route runner to shake off the defender. I use my tight end for medium throws and blocking, but even with a WR in the slot I don't see bad blocking from then. I used to run Patterson/Shorts in the slot before so I rarely touched them before and now. But yeah a TE could fit nicely for blocking in the slot, but I prefer the speed a little bit more."
MaddenMobileForums,3c51r5,xKizume,3,Sun Jul 5 02:02:22 2015 UTC,Your list is missing MM Rice.
MaddenMobileForums,3c51r5,theskyhooker,2,Sat Jul 4 21:53:30 2015 UTC,is that out yet? I haven't seen any on the market- is that just because it's rare (like MM Barry)?

Demario Davis, Kyle Long, Joe Thomas, Justin Houston, and Jason Kelce to name a few worth getting, as well as JPP. I also reccomend Ronnie Lott for your SS.

And yeah positional hero JPP would be a good edition as well

MaddenMobileForums,3c36ls,YLSP,2,Sat Jul 4 09:02:06 2015 UTC,"I have ~ 200k coins to spend and I'm looking for upgrades to specific positions.  In general I've rolled with a ""budget"" team of players in the 92-96 area but after achieving that I've added enough pieces that I'm happy with my Offense, it's my Defense that needs a couple more tweaks.      Morgan Burnett (92) at Strong Safety - I love the way this guy plays and never found someone in the 96 type of level to replace him.    Is there anyone in the 97+ level who is fun to play with?  I guess my options are Atwater (98), FB Ed Reed (98), FE Weddle (98) or someone else I'm not thinking of.  How is FB Adrian Wilson (96)?    Connor Barwin (92) at Strong-Side LB.  Again - he's been pretty solid for my defense.  Looking for someone in the 96+ level to replace him.  One caveat is that I don't want Lavonte David.  My son uses him in that position and I'm trying to not duplicate players across our teams.  Options I'm looking at now are RTTP Deandre Levy (96) or even FE Connor Barwin (96) and there's also Honors Davis.       Looking for all types of suggestions, 200k to upgrade one position or both.  I'm just looking to tweak things right now and spend some coins."
MaddenMobileForums,3c36ls,theskyhooker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:54:10 2015 UTC,"I would say that since you liked FO Barwin, FE Barwin is the best choice to replace him because he's better across the board so he's sure to play as well or better.  However, if you're looking for a big upgrade here, you should be able to build PH Houston for 200k, and he's an absolute monster.  To replace Morgan Burnett, I highly recommend getting FB LaRon Landry.  Don't let his crummy coverage stats fool you, he plays like a stud and has gotten me many picks.  I also play FB Wilson, who is worse in gameplay and you should really only use him for the +AWR.  LaRon Landry is a great option at safety, though."
MaddenMobileForums,3c36ls,YLSP,2,Sat Jul 4 12:54:24 2015 UTC,Thanks - Looking at the MUT Head database right now and trying to decide between 96 Barwin and 96 Levy.  I actually think I will try 96 Levy.   I'm a Redskin fan - so I'll go with Landry (would be all over a Sean Taylor).

MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,Syth1579,-3,Fri Jul 3 23:51:41 2015 UTC,mm's r not based on 1 season they have to be consistently good rg3 is not
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,SackRVC17,5,Fri Jul 3 23:57:08 2015 UTC,"So then why did Vick get a card? He organized dog fights and now he's washed up. He isn't close to good anymore. And if it's based on career, why doesn't Manning have a card? He isn't even done his season is he is in the top 10 best of all time, and owns hundreds of records."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,Syth1579,4,Sat Jul 4 00:05:44 2015 UTC,its about players who have either been really good for many years in real life or in madden.  Thats why vick has one he is widely considered one of the best madden qbs ever which is why ea put him on the all madden team in madden 25. Peyton is getting one tomorrow sooooo....
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,SackRVC17,2,Sat Jul 4 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"The only other player EA has announced aside from RG3 and VJax is Derrick Johnson, which I don't think we will be getting since legends already dropped for this week, and I don't see EA dropping four in one week."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,Syth1579,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:20:52 2015 UTC,Don't forget he had an extremely fast combine 40 time.  Vick is FAST

MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,GiveMeSomeIhedigbo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:28:06 2015 UTC,How did Plaxico get a card? The dude had a slightly above average season according to his card
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,Shootoo,2,Sat Jul 4 00:54:40 2015 UTC,"not to defend him, but he did make the game winning super bowl td catch vs the undefeated patriots."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,LecMalenza,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:35:32 2015 UTC,I know right!  The best thing that they can write on his card is that he led the Giants in receiving yards one year.  There are 32 NFL players every year who lead their team in receiving yards.  How the hell can you give him a Mobile Master for that?
MaddenMobileForums,3c1syr,theskyhooker,2,Sat Jul 4 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"maybe its because EA is just trying to find players to give a 99 rating to, so people can keep playing"
MaddenMobileForums,3c3gle,KoziBucks,3,Sat Jul 4 11:50:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I never punt.  So I'm getting a boost out of that guy. I might as well get something out of the position if I can."
MaddenMobileForums,3c3gle,theskyhooker,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Positioning  First of all, Vontae is your best CB.  I would put Vontae at CB1, Pat Pete at CB2, Deion in the nickel, and Tracy Porter in the dime.  Next, I would switch your OLBs, because how you have it set right now, Thomas Davis is doing the blitzing and James Harrison is almost always in coverage.  You want to switch this around, because Harrison is the pass rusher and Davis the coverage OLB.  You should also switch your safeties.  Harrison Smith is a great FS for his coverage while Kam Chancellor is a great SS for his tackle and hit power, and you have them in the opposite positions.  Finally, I would switch Dez Bryant and Calvin Johnson.  Calvin is the big, strong, tall one who you want to throw huge lobs to, which is what WR2 is designed for.  Dez is a speedster more suited to WR1, where screens go.  Upgrades  Cordarrelle Patterson and Delanie Walker are your obvious weak points on offense.  Now that the slot is a usable position, I prefer to use an actual threat there rather than throw it away for an AWR boost.  I would go try to get an actual slot receiver.  I would go for FB DeSean Jackson.  He's quick and has good hands.  At TE, I would get PH Jimmy Graham.  His height is unreal, and he'll bring in a lot of balls.  On the defense, Bobby Wagner is really weak to still be starting on your team.  I would get Christmas Lambert to replace him.  Finally, I would start saving for MJG to bump Honors Donald out to the 4-3 over Shelton."

MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,kavuong,11,Fri Jul 3 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, amazing. Highest QB was 90 Manning before the RTTR came out with 90 Flacco, and then Warren Moon and Cunningham were considered god like. 89 Gronk and Graham used to cost 90k each, which back then was a fortune. Everything back then could easily be obtained by earning money through Season, and GC, FA and Veterans were highly played events because of the chances of elite players, which could sell for quite a bit. Now, everyone has elite players, season games and live events are nearly useless, and the only way to get money is to play the AH, not the actual game.     THIS is why I'm looking forward to the reset. Things were so much better before the money glitch and player glitch."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,Syth1579,5,Fri Jul 3 23:19:27 2015 UTC,"MVP's were huge afterwards as well. I remember when the best TE was MVP Gronk, his card used to go for a lot... man times have changed..."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,xKizume,3,Sat Jul 4 00:01:54 2015 UTC,"I remember when Troy Aikman was the most sought after QB in the game, and he was a 94 from RTTR. Then Marino came out. I also remember when Thanksgiving Suggs came out and was the best LB in the game at 96, and now a 96 LB is something nearly everyone has."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,Syth1579,5,Sat Jul 4 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"Ever since the ""99 million glitch"" period came, nothing has been the same. It has been all down hill from there but I miss the old times when there were less 90+ players compared to now. I wasn't a big auction kind of person back then so I missed out a lot, but times have changed so much."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,xKizume,4,Sat Jul 4 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"I remember the days where an E.J Manuel went for around 10-15k, and that was bidding. Now, you could buy one for around 5k when the market isn't inflated. Legend packs used to be the HARDEST thing to get, and when players packs were out, if you could afford one, you made a guaranteed profit, as all gold players would run for at least buy now 7k."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,Syth1579,4,Sat Jul 4 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm crazy but it seemed like the market was actually normal back then, I mean right now it is very easy to reach a high overall and I don't mind that but back then there was an actual balance before glitches ruined it. The only thing that has retained price is MM players, and PH have been fluctuating because of Gridiron. I just miss upgrading my team when I was a low overall, seemed more rewarding as well."
MaddenMobileForums,3c1ox0,xKizume,3,Sat Jul 4 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"I highly miss upgrading a team. My next upgrade for ANY position, aside from rebuying Hekker is going to be upwards of two million. It's terrible. But I liked the days when it took a lot of time to even get an 85 overall team, but now, 96 overall is nothing, and once you hit hundreds, you're doing alright. There isn't a need to play the game anymore because all the things that EA offers from season games or live events are near to useless now. Hell, my GC Kaepernick sold for 45k back when I had Aikman and Marino was the best QB in the game, and I used that to get two better WRs and a halfback."
MaddenMobileForums,3c2jbc,ilikesantorums,4,Sat Jul 4 04:01:53 2015 UTC,"Offensive  1. QB  2. WR 3. HB  Defense 1. CB 2. S 3. DE  Any elite player pretty much is a solid player in game in those positions, imo. Of course the best are the MM/PH players."
MaddenMobileForums,3c2jbc,xKizume,2,Sat Jul 4 04:14:21 2015 UTC,"Well in a stat perspective, 99 Barry Sanders, John Randle, Anthony Munoz, MM Richard Sherman, MM JJ Watt, and MM Lawrence Taylor are the major G.O.A.Ts.   In my experience, any 99, usually over 500k, is outstanding. Dez Bryant, Jimmy Graham, Demarco Murray, JPP, and Patrick Peterson are some that break this hypothetical '500k' rule. Its really up to you."
MaddenMobileForums,3c2jbc,Nomz0,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:36:34 2015 UTC,MM Gronk has been my star. He catches almost anything. Out jumps/muscles in traffic. Makes crazy dive catches. Tough to bring down. And dude is quick.

MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,theskyhooker,5,Fri Jul 3 19:06:07 2015 UTC,How's the player compare to other top QBs?
MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,ZtheT,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"He's a little bit slower but a little more accurate than Vick, and a little faster but a little less accurate than Wilson.  He also has 100 throw power, which is nice.  I would say he's the best mobile QB.  Comparison"
MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,ZtheT,6,Fri Jul 3 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"MM Brady still top dog, unless you really want the mobility."
MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,PackersMadden,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, MM Brady is the most accurate, but he also can't scramble at all.  I'm usually a pocket passer (I've always used FB Warner), but I'll have to learn how to use a scrambling QB because I really want this new RG3."
MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,TimHepp,5,Fri Jul 3 20:09:32 2015 UTC,Just like on console! Ahhh love pulling these. ;)  It should be like this always. There shouldn't be any Milestone live events imo
MaddenMobileForums,3c0urr,SackRVC17,4,Fri Jul 3 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"That would actually be pretty cool if there were no milestone live events.

MaddenMobileForums,3c1epj,Ryan5427,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:10:12 2015 UTC,The easiest choice for an upgrade that I see is using your CW cards to get Von Miller. Free upgrade to a 99 LB.

MaddenMobileForums,3bzzgl,kingdylan1,3,Fri Jul 3 15:19:53 2015 UTC,Wow I'm think him at WR2 with FE Brown at WR1 is pretty much the ultimate setup. Probably try and throw Rice in the Slot if I can ever get him too...
MaddenMobileForums,3bzzgl,TheRealFluffy0ne,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:28:10 2015 UTC,I might put FE Brown in the slot with Rice at WR1.  Brown's low STR and CAR make me worry about fumbles on screen plays.
MaddenMobileForums,3bzzgl,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Fri Jul 3 18:34:20 2015 UTC,Certainly an option. I see people use Fitz at WR1 a lot and Rice seems like a better version of him.   I like a burner at WR1 for screens. Used FB Hester for the longest time. FE Brown hasn't fumbled once yet so not too worried about the STR and Carry. I run a lot of screens and end arounds too.
MaddenMobileForums,3bzzgl,TheRealFluffy0ne,3,Fri Jul 3 19:50:40 2015 UTC,Manually entered his stats into the sheet btw. He's #5 for OVR after Dez.

MaddenMobileForums,3bzg72,ZtheT,2,Fri Jul 3 11:52:52 2015 UTC,Nice pull!  But people could see alot better if you would use imgur cause you can barely see the picture on photobucket.
MaddenMobileForums,3bzg72,kendallfriesen,2,Fri Jul 3 12:14:43 2015 UTC,Nice man. Congrats! Saving all my packs till tomorrow
MaddenMobileForums,3bzg72,PackersMadden,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:17 2015 UTC,Why? The new legends are already out??

MaddenMobileForums,3bzg72,BenjimanWa,2,Fri Jul 3 13:59:53 2015 UTC,Werent those 4th of July Legends?.. Im confused. I see them on the AH.
MaddenMobileForums,3bzg72,PackersMadden,3,Fri Jul 3 14:05:18 2015 UTC,"Idk EA didn't make a statement or release saying 4th of July legends so, we will have to see if they will release 2 more tomorrow."

I opened Legend Packs every time they were available with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 times. I got a few elites but never once have I gotten a single Legend, or Rookie once. I have friends who have opened less than half as many Legend packs as me and have gotten 2 or 3.   I feel your pain.   On the flip side I can't complain about my team. I'm currently 103/103/101"

Atlease It didn't completely suck. But they won't get me much. Than I did a lqs I got 50k n a 1k. Still lost out on 180k. If I'm lucky. It could be more depending on what I can sell the elites for. Normally I don't even get packs just take advantage of the ah. I just thought today would be my lucky day.

MaddenMobileForums,3bze9t,kendallfriesen,3,Fri Jul 3 11:28:40 2015 UTC,I would sell. But later. Or now if you don't want to wait

MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,TimHepp,5,Fri Jul 3 15:19:20 2015 UTC,What a joke a mm rg three and out. He is the laughing stock of qbs right now. Shame on you EA.
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,skinsballr,2,Fri Jul 3 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"Says the Cowboys fan. Redskins fan here - yes, he doesn't deserve an MM card, BUT he had a historic rookie year that is overlooked by his progressively-worse sophomore and junior injury-plagued seasons.  Also, RGIII is more patriotic than you think; he was born in Japan to two U.S. Army Sergeants - that is a sure sign of patriotism.  I liked that he got a Combine Warrior card, but he definitely does NOT deserve an MM card - this coming from a guy who has a Fathead poster of RGIII!"
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,theskyhooker,2,Fri Jul 3 10:49:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's that bad of a choice for a Mobile Master.  His rookie season was the greatest rookie season for a quarterback of all time.  102.4 passer rating combined with over 800 rushing yards is damn amazing.  He turned a 2011 5-11 team into a 2012 10-6 team.  Everybody gives him crap because of his poor later seasons, but 2012 was an absolutely amazing season from RG3, unprecedented in NFL history.  Also, the Mobile Masters bar has already been set pretty low by selections like Ndamukong Suh and Marshawn Lynch.  Both are great players, but neither are historic players.  RG3's rookie season will go down as the best of all time.  He's certainly better than Plaxico Burress ever was."
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,SackRVC17,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"no i completely disagree, not only should an mm not be based solely on one great season but it is very debatable that rg3's rookie season was the best ever by a qb"
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,theskyhooker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:54:56 2015 UTC,Whose rookie season was better?
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,SackRVC17,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:26:19 2015 UTC,cam newton possibly he threw for more yards more td's and rushed for more td's
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,theskyhooker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"Cam threw one more TD than RG3 and threw 12 more picks than him.  Also, Cam only threw for more yards because he threw 124 more passes than RG3 did.  RG3 had a better completion percentage and a better average yards per completion.  As far as rushing, RG3 rushed for more yards than Cam with less attempts than Cam.  I would say that's more important than the number of touchdowns.  Also, keep in mind that RG3 played one less game than Cam did, and his numbers are still this good.  RG3's rookie year was better than Cam Newton's, and better than anybody else's in history too."
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,TimHepp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"I live in Maryland I am very aware of everything Washington redskins and RGIII related. He knows nothing about what a teammate should act like. He is a me first person who consistently blames everybody else before he will blame himself. he is the quarterback and supposed to be the leader of the team and all he does is cry about what everybody else isn't doing and not worrying about how to get better himself. he personally got the shanahans fired because Daniel Snyder is up his ass. just because his parents we're in the military doesn't make him a military person. if anything I would expect better from him because he was raised with better morals and the way he acts. and for his historical rookie season it was more play calling in the scheme that he was In that made him look so good. He wasn't asked to do much. He ran a gimmick scheme that worked for 2/3s of the season. Because the whole nfl was new to it. Once there was game tape and time to scheme against it, it didn't work nearly as good."
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,TimHepp,-1,Fri Jul 3 10:59:44 2015 UTC,"Ikr? Just say 4th of July legend, and I'm fine with it, but MM?"
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,AXZ082,0,Fri Jul 3 10:46:01 2015 UTC,Independence day I don't think of a bum called RGIII. This would of been a perfect Holiday to make an 99 fourth of July pat Tillman card. But hey what do I know.
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,NJSeahawks,3,Fri Jul 3 10:49:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, on console there is a 4th of July legend for the raiders,Chiefs, Buccaneers, Redskins, bears, and cardinals. RgIII is the one for the Redskins. It also makes sense because both of his parents are involved in the military"
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,SackRVC17,2,Fri Jul 3 12:43:31 2015 UTC,Pat Tillman would be GOAT
MaddenMobileForums,3bz9yq,westywall,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:01:18 2015 UTC,Jared Lorenzen is more of a legend.

My problem with calvin, who far exceeded every other reciever as far as holding on to the ball after the catch (in the past) is that now he either gets picked off or can't hold on to the ball at least 1 out of 5 throws.  I've got his speed and acc at 99 and strength at 83 but still.  Since players are now more affordable, I'm thinking maybe I should hold out for Larry Fitzgerald. I noticed that taller recievers are much better.  Thanks for the info...my next question is plaxico or Fitzgerald.  No disrespect to rice, but I think he's not tall enough."

MaddenMobileForums,3bz95m,TimHepp,4,Fri Jul 3 10:22:49 2015 UTC,Earl Thomas. the 96 is a nice card but he should have a 99 as the best free safety in the game
MaddenMobileForums,3bz95m,charlorlor,3,Fri Jul 3 10:37:03 2015 UTC,I like his card I use it for the +2 strength boost. But I do agree he should be a 99.
MaddenMobileForums,3bz95m,bran861,4,Fri Jul 3 10:40:53 2015 UTC,Alex Mack. The best C in the league. 89 is a little insulting.

MaddenMobileForums,3bzzcu,westywall,2,Fri Jul 3 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is pretty slow, but that's okay for deep threats.  I'm going to be honest here, I was completely shocked when I saw RG3 was the new Mobile Master.  I figure maybe they're trying to get a Mobile Master from every team, and I think we could see MM MJD.  I still have Madden 08 at my house, and MJD plays like a stud for me lol."

MaddenMobileForums,3by05x,Jsweezy23,3,Fri Jul 3 02:21:11 2015 UTC,its a big risk to make alt account but i know someone who spent 7 mil on legend packs and made 50 mil because he packed julius peppers twice suh twice and other legends

MaddenMobileForums,3by05x,WolverineBlue18,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:42:59 2015 UTC,Legend packs usually only give the set legends...so if those are the ones you need just buy them.  Their price will drop with legend packs out.  It always happens.    If you are trying to just make profit to buy the non-set legends it is risky.  2 or 3 times ago I opened 18 legend packs and pulled one legend (Antonio Gates) and lost a ton of coins.

MaddenMobileForums,3by05x,patsman101,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:12:12 2015 UTC,I would straight up buy the players. There are good cards out there like Willis MM that is possible to get in a legend pack but I don't think anyone has pulled a non-set MM in a legend pack.
MaddenMobileForums,3by9vf,ZtheT,3,Fri Jul 3 03:47:40 2015 UTC,well i need him for my legacy team... i want as many buccs players as i can get on it lol
MaddenMobileForums,3by9vf,kingdylan1,5,Fri Jul 3 04:08:39 2015 UTC,if i have one madden wish we need another 99 fb and i want a mike alstott lol
MaddenMobileForums,3by9vf,kingdylan1,2,Fri Jul 3 04:12:17 2015 UTC,If they made Alstott and Ronde Barber MM cards I would drop $150 easy on this game just to get them

MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,chakazulu77,6,Thu Jul 2 18:23:04 2015 UTC,I would venture it will follow roughly the same trend as last season...
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Thu Jul 2 18:30:17 2015 UTC,At the beggining a 92 overall player would go for probably around 500k and high 70s will go for between 15-25k
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,patsman101,3,Thu Jul 2 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"No probably not, coins are very low when the game begins. 100k is like a ton.   And to the OP's question, there probably won't be many cards above 91 even."
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,Falcons_241,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, last season JJ Watt was the only card whose base was over 91.  I would guess this year Watt will also be the best one."
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,theskyhooker,2,Thu Jul 2 23:30:26 2015 UTC,I disagree completely the fun starts when the 99s are unleashed
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,Sergatron23,2,Thu Jul 2 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"Things really got out of hand fast. I mean, brick killed a guy!"
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,Duffyd680,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:55:40 2015 UTC,There will be a new base set of elites that will be worth a TON
MaddenMobileForums,3bwdys,vN_GreeD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make a difference, 99 overall players vary so greatly from one another (ihedibo vs Lott), the number is arbitrary"
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,somuchyumyumyum,3,Thu Jul 2 23:15:38 2015 UTC,Make PH Vontae and get Bruce smith or JJ Watt you can also make PH Julio but depending on how much money you get also make the PH tackles but those are more expensive
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,Bakeddoritoman,2,Thu Jul 2 23:25:19 2015 UTC,Is Vontae really worth it? because my corner situation isn't bad.
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,Bakeddoritoman,2,Fri Jul 3 00:36:44 2015 UTC,he has by far the best stats and better than all your corners he is one of my favorite players to have in the game and he's pretty cheap
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,Bakeddoritoman,2,Fri Jul 3 00:50:48 2015 UTC,Should I place him no.1 over Sherman or no. 2 to replace pat pete?
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,Bakeddoritoman,2,Fri Jul 3 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"Vontae should be no.1 corner no.2 is pat pete and dom sherman should be no.3 because dom sherman has the worst coverage for a 99 corner so if you put him in the no.3 spot he plays the least, but you still get the boost from him."
MaddenMobileForums,3bxfqj,theskyhooker,2,Fri Jul 3 02:28:33 2015 UTC,doesn't his lower speed let him get in front of receivers on deep bombs?
MaddenMobileForums,3by2pm,awesom567,4,Fri Jul 3 02:44:13 2015 UTC,Not good considering we're probably losing LaMarcus.

MaddenMobileForums,3bvoy1,Thatlittlekitty,5,Thu Jul 2 15:13:03 2015 UTC,Good luck man. Packs are completely dry. EA probably won't juice them up..
MaddenMobileForums,3bvoy1,PackersMadden,3,Thu Jul 2 15:18:17 2015 UTC,good luck i did 200k+ today and didnt get a single elite besides a captain collectible
MaddenMobileForums,3bvoy1,ghd1353,3,Thu Jul 2 15:23:08 2015 UTC,Spent bout 750k so far on pro packs between yesterday and day. Got lucky with a ryan allen and some elite o-linemen so i broke even. Gonna open more today.
MaddenMobileForums,3bvoy1,FUBARRRRR,2,Thu Jul 2 18:18:26 2015 UTC,good luck
MaddenMobileForums,3bvoy1,awesom567,2,Thu Jul 2 15:13:59 2015 UTC,I spent 1 mil on packs today. Ended up losing around 500k. It was fun at least!

MaddenMobileForums,3bw016,Orangeskill,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"completing sets helps your season score. turn in players to trophies and do LQS, that's your best bet"
MaddenMobileForums,3bw016,LecMalenza,2,Thu Jul 2 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't think LQS is worth it.  You're dumping 27k worth of trophies in for an extremely low chance of even getting a 25k quick sell, most likely you'll get 5k.. You should just sell the trophies."
MaddenMobileForums,3bw016,Dubzil,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"you're probably right. i've been doing the pro packs into trophies and have only hit 100k once and 25k once in 10 LQS, and at least 5 were 1k :("
MaddenMobileForums,3bw016,LecMalenza,2,Thu Jul 2 18:35:35 2015 UTC,24 LQS's and I'd bet 18 of them have been 1k.  I know it's just random luck of the draw but damn it's frustrating.   Sounds like consensus is to turn players into trophies though....

MaddenMobileForums,3bwm2e,vollkoemmenes,3,Thu Jul 2 21:18:47 2015 UTC,Is no one else surprised by the limit of 4? You can normally only buy 3. That's a little concerning.
MaddenMobileForums,3bwm2e,bran861,2,Thu Jul 2 21:41:09 2015 UTC,Hmmm... Think we should have waited a little longer on those MM Barry Purchases... Lol damnit... Hopefully I can scrape together enough for Watt and possibly whoever the new rookie is...

MaddenMobileForums,3bwm2e,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:20 2015 UTC,True true... we'll see... if this means that they're starting back up the usual pack cycle due to complaints then there will probably be an MM topper bundle coming soon...

MaddenMobileForums,3bumj6,Ryan5427,2,Thu Jul 2 07:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Prices have skyrocketed enough to make pro packs (almost?) profitable again."
MaddenMobileForums,3bumj6,PackersMadden,2,Thu Jul 2 07:56:49 2015 UTC,Yes. Definitely will agree. Nice solution man. But buying pro packs will still be very risky.
MaddenMobileForums,3bumj6,ZtheT,2,Thu Jul 2 08:17:11 2015 UTC,"If nothing drops for the 4th of July, which likely nothing will, more people will spend. The console having special packs and events for the holiday has a lot of mobile users hoping."
MaddenMobileForums,3bumj6,JackBauerNFL,2,Thu Jul 2 11:37:24 2015 UTC,This is nothing like the winter spike. I made $10 mil in 3 days by completing the 30 team sets and then 10 MVP's for Thomas.  I'm sitting on a few mil hoping new packs drop the weekend but after that your Pro pack strategy makes perfect sense.
MaddenMobileForums,3bumj6,fantasyfootballiowa,2,Thu Jul 2 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that pro packs drop almost nothing. I've spent probably about 700k on pro packs and received only 3 elites. One was a Justin Tucker, so I'm not that upset, but without that one pull I'd have absolutely nothing to show for it."

MaddenMobileForums,3btt9l,not_Brendan,3,Thu Jul 2 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"or the d coordinator actually has different defensive styles and play calling preferences in h2h games and ability to use the strengths of your defense. like if your d-line was 95 avg but your lbs 98 avg, maybe run more 3-4 defense, or if your secondary had good man cover run more man cover d instead of zone."

MaddenMobileForums,3btt9l,womtei,2,Thu Jul 2 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think instead of countering plays, you can create defensive schemes like DC based on your personnel. Since there are different offensive formations and different defensive formations, you can set them accordingly. For example, if they line up in the I-formation, you'll pick a defensive formation (like 3-4 defensive play designed to stop the run like Pinch) or if they do shotgun with 3 wr + te, you can pick a nickel or dime defensive formation (9-Velcro or db blitz or something like that)"

MaddenMobileForums,3bthso,bran861,2,Thu Jul 2 01:19:20 2015 UTC,I hear you. It's pretty dumb of EA. Six weeks is a crucial time to keep your customers and not lose them. Focusing too much on the reset and not on the now is going to lose them business.
MaddenMobileForums,3bthso,PackersMadden,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:38:14 2015 UTC,ive been playing since March and sport a 101/95 team. And I want to boost my D but I can't afford to. I won't buy anything since I'm saving my money in case legendary packs come out.

MaddenMobileForums,3bthso,StanleyTheBugman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"Probably pro packs honestly. I know its stupid and probably won't get me where I want to go compared to the AH but I like the gamble, and if I gamble enough I should theoretically get some improvements."

MaddenMobileForums,3bu81c,gkalldamday,3,Thu Jul 2 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I ended up building my Gronk when Legends weren't in, and I spend 1.5 million for his gold card, and about 2.5k for the collectables, and I already had the gold trophies. His price right now is 3 million for his elite, and there are no golds on the market. This is probably a terrible price for him, judging that I could have paid 2 million for his elite instead of building him.     Webster, judging the prices of 99 centers right now, I'd say 2.5 or even 2 mil is a fair price, but it MAY fall during legends, but only slightly, like a couple hundred thousand. Webster's cheapest right now is 2.85 million, so I wouldn't bite quite yet. I remember a few weeks ago when I saw Webster going for 2.5 or 2 million.     Everything is inflated at the moment as well, so prices may just go upwards. Legend packs would help a lot, but idk when we will see them next, and how much they will help prices now. They may go slightly down, but not near what they used to be is what I'm thinking."
MaddenMobileForums,3bu81c,Syth1579,3,Thu Jul 2 05:38:58 2015 UTC,This is all good info I appreciate it. I guess I'm terrible about coins burning a hole in my pocket and I honestly don't think there will be another legend pack roll out.
MaddenMobileForums,3bu81c,Syth1579,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:42:38 2015 UTC,"With the new packs being prepared for next season, I'm thinking we won't have anymore packs roll out either, or they will be slowed down quite a bit. You can either take a gamble and monitor their prices for a while, like not buying until it reaches a certain price, or buy one once you feel its reasonable. I ended up waiting three or four days for the K/P collectables to drop, but I ended up buying one at 500k and the other at 545k. I felt that they would just increase since packs are becoming more and more scarce."
MaddenMobileForums,3bu81c,westywall,2,Thu Jul 2 05:46:44 2015 UTC,"Just another thing, its a sellers marked during the day and a buyers market at night.  Prices begin to lower at night, so buy then"
MaddenMobileForums,3bu81c,westywall,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:23 2015 UTC,I noticed this big time I could have bought a Webster last night 2.8m and now the cheapest is 4m lol

MaddenMobileForums,3btoz1,theskyhooker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:51:05 2015 UTC,He should also sell MM calvin tbh.  that would net 1mil at least with which he could make PH Dez and PH Julio and still have 400k left over

Since I'm ""poor"" myself, I cant donate, but here are some Money Making tips:  I'd start off by flipping gold and elite trophies. I'd buy/snipe them for 2k and flip for 5k. Both trophies flip at these prices. you will make very low margins, but you can gain some cash quickly if you manage to do this in high volumes. snipe at night for the best deals.  Also make guest accounts by connecting to a fake Facebook and the log out. create another fake facebook, then proceed to rush for 80 yards and pass for . 80 yards in h2h and season. this will earn you a free 20k plus a shit ton of trophies which you can use for Large quicksell set or just to sell on Auction House (Gold trophies for 4.5k-5k and silver for 1.3k). then log out and log in with your actual account and post a crappy bronze player for the exact amount that is in the fake account. then logout and login with the fake account and but that exact player (set the AH search parameters to that exact player) and buy it. Then the money you have made will transfer and you can log back into your main and be at least 20k richer. Repeat until it bores you (which is really fast, this is tedious even if it only really takes 10-15 min).  It wont impact your potentially lost account b/c it is thru FB only..."

MaddenMobileForums,3bs1gw,Billymul98,0,Thu Jul 2 06:15:53 2015 UTC,Landon collins draft card with +1 spd at safety. Also ereck flowers draft card gives a boost to your line.

Any 80+ gold player should get 5-10k, so you're better off only using <80 gold players to do trade in and selling >80 players on the AH."

I run sproles now at fb with barry at hb...sure sproles gets destroyed a lot of times by defenders but at least he slows them down enough so that barry can get loose."

While we're here...is an 80 overall decent for a team? I'm doing okay, but I have problems with controls during plays (spinning/juking/etc.) so even though I have better OVR than my opponents I get stuffed and stuff all the time.

MaddenMobileForums,3bn318,tmpkiwi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"The question here is how many accounts constitute the 100% and how many of those are actually active. Of my 10-15 facebook friends who used the app at some point only one kept going till 102 overall and will probably say he has the 100% season score. The rest left or erased the app at around 80 ovr.  But yeah, feels great to be the 3%."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn318,MrSkimMilk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:56:21 2015 UTC,guess it makes sense since this sub only has 2250 people subscribed and probably 90% of that 2.25k has 100% season score.
MaddenMobileForums,3bn318,UffaloIlls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the 97% that are not at 100 season score are people who stopped playing the game. In my facebook friends, there are about 20 people who have the game and only 2 or 3 actually tried and the rest still have 60 overalls after months because they don't play anymore. I doubt you could be playing so long without being at 100 by now"

MaddenMobileForums,3bp6io,ZtheT,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, because more people get them and everyone wants the quick buck and they will start undercutting each other to lower the price. But anything low enough for potential profit comes with competition because buyers looking to increase their coins will get in on it. But there is always an easy sweet spot where the player is cheaper, but not cheap enough for a significant profit, so he's a little easier to get. So, you can probably get Kam for 250k or slightly less, whereas on off days he goes for 300k plus."

MaddenMobileForums,3boxmk,bundleofsocks,4,Tue Jun 30 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"When I bought him I regularly looked for a couple of weeks to monitor his price. At the time, he was going for just over 5 million, but not selling easily at that price. It's important to understand the difference between what a player is listed for, and what he will actually sell for, especially with the rarer more expensive cards.  Anyway, I'd see him pop up in the low to mid 4 mil range from time to time, and he never lasted long. When I was ready to buy, I knew I would not pay more because I knew it was only a matter of time. I eventually got him for 4.2 million, which is a great price.  Now, this was about a month ago. With the current pack drought and more people possibly coming to the same realization, he might  cost more. You need to study him before you buy him, unless you happen to see a too good to be true price early."
MaddenMobileForums,3boxmk,ZtheT,3,Tue Jun 30 23:35:12 2015 UTC,4-5 mill right now without packs. If packs come out it would be 3.5 mill
MaddenMobileForums,3boxmk,BenjimanWa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"He's a pull/topper, so packs don't impact him as much as rookie legend cards."

MaddenMobileForums,3boxmk,Jsweezy23,2,Wed Jul 1 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"He can and so can Willis, but they are extremely rare. They are more often seen as toppers with paid packs, either Flashback or Rising Stars packs. The rookie legends which are sets are the ones that you will see more of with Legend Packs which you can get with coins. For this reason, pulls/toppers are rarer and cost more."

MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,UffaloIlls,3,Tue Jun 30 16:42:24 2015 UTC,would GC ryan give you that extra boost?
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,Bvitamins1,3,Tue Jun 30 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"No, turns out he drops special teams down to 97 and nerfs a bunch of the 101 STR guys too much. My OVR drop to 105 with him in."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,apollonese,2,Tue Jun 30 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"no, he'd take his overall down - after 100 overall, the boost from  him doesn't do as much as his lower lvl card #"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,3,Tue Jun 30 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Our teams are very similar. I don't have Barry yet, but soon. I could have gotten him today, but holding out hope his price drops just a little. The rest of our O is the same.  On D, I have MM Sherman, no Dom. And I have Lott instead of Night Train. The rest is the same."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 17:04:49 2015 UTC,Nice! Are you able to hit 106 OVR without Dom Sherman?
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"Not with who I have, but who knows if I was to get Sanders, Watt, Rice, and others that might come out like the MM Night Train.  Question. Argument for Bo in the flex over Bruce Miller? Miller has far superior run blocking stats. Of course, Bo is a much better HB."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,womtei,2,Tue Jun 30 17:21:27 2015 UTC,So what I've found with the really fast HBs like Barry and AP is that on outside runs Bruce Miller isn't quite fast enough to block effectively.   He is great up the middle though. Usually pancakes one or two guys. I run to the outside a lot with my speed guys though so Bruce was less effective for me.  I also pass to my FB quite a bit so Bo is obviously great for that. He also blocks surprisingly well too due to his high STR. Not at all uncommon for him to pancake DBs.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,womtei,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"exactly the reason I still use 98 Franco instead of PH Miller.  speed kills.  Although, I'd consider blowing 5mil on AP. He has better blocking, I think.  Edit: lol never mind, AP has +3 RBK over Bo, but it's still only 55 and only 92 Strength compared with 95 for Bo. so yeah"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,awesom567,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:21:33 2015 UTC,What plays do you run to pass to fb?
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,rafael27diaz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly the Pass Attacks. Short passes like PA Boot LT, PA TE Drag, PA TE Corner. Also Long Passes: Flats, and PA Comeback Slide are really good."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ConfusedAlgerian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks. I'm trying to increase the number of plays to run against these 105+ defenses and always end up with my safety net plays of throwing to my rb on slants middle, double slant, curls, and fl drag. Now to get a speed back for my rb position and switch bo into the flex."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,cheesypie777,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:06:44 2015 UTC,Bo is a tough play at Flex since he's so damn fast. In my experience he would get too far ahead of most other backs on outside runs. I used Bo at HB and FB Faulk at FB though for a long time and really liked the setup. With speed backs you do a lot of outside runs and even though Faulk isn't much of a blocker he will tie up one DB long enough for Bo to zip by.  Depending how you boost Faulk might work at HB with Bo at Flex. I would definitely recommend trying to get Faulk to 99 spd/99 acc though if you have Bo at Flex though.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Wed Jul 1 18:11:38 2015 UTC,nice team
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ConfusedAlgerian,2,Tue Jun 30 18:28:55 2015 UTC,Nasty.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ConfusedAlgerian,2,Tue Jun 30 16:42:51 2015 UTC,What improvements are there?
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ConfusedAlgerian,3,Tue Jun 30 16:44:51 2015 UTC,New watt. Maybe new rice?
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,EK22,3,Tue Jun 30 16:46:35 2015 UTC,Yep. If I can ever find them on the market... Possibly MM Atwater too as an upgrade to Kam.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ram1113,2,Tue Jun 30 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"Not to mention if you can afford them. Your bank went way down with the purchase of Sanders, unless you got a stash in an alt account."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,bundleofsocks,3,Tue Jun 30 19:39:59 2015 UTC,Lol I had a few million stashed in an alt and I made back 5m selling MM Adrian Peterson.  In anycase I don't have anywhere near another 30 million to drop on any of them...
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, but good luck getting those..."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 16:51:51 2015 UTC,Right now just MM Watt and MM Rice. Possibly MM Atwater to replace Kam.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"I think kams better with the str boost, not positive though. Hard to test with no legend packs..."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:21 2015 UTC,I ran some tests awhile back and I think MM Lott was better for OVR than Kam. Even with the loss of SPD boost. That's why I think Atwater might be better. Anyways like you said... hard to do anything without legend packs...
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"I mean Lott's fairly cheap. Also, shouldn't you swap vontae and sherm? Vontae is much better for covering"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Oh I have Lott. This setup actually isn't completely optimized for OVR. Even with everyone in and correctly placed in I'm still 107 def with 106 OVR. So this setup is geared towards slightly better gameplay while maintaining the 107 def rating.  Vontae is a little bit short for covering the deep threat WRs. That's why I'm using him at nickel to cover the slot. Of course if someone plays a TE in the slot it's the same issue...  I was running Vontae at CB1, NTL at CB2, and Dom Sherm at nickel for awhile but some guys that did a bunch of gameplay analysis claim this setup should be better. Probably splitting hairs at this point to be honest..."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,xKizume,2,Tue Jun 30 17:16:51 2015 UTC,That linebacking core has me all fuzzy inside
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,xKizume,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:32 2015 UTC,Protip: Nickle and dime are evaluated as safeties.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnd01,PackersMadden,2,Tue Jun 30 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm aware. The ""ideal"" setup is still 107 def and 106 OVR so I'm going with this for gameplay right now."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,TheRealFluffy0ne,6,Tue Jun 30 16:04:13 2015 UTC,These non-auctionable players give me hope... SR Barry was sick this past season...
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,banterchamp,5,Tue Jun 30 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say it'll be a standard, maybe 87 OVR guy that'll be in everyone's teams for a while but soon will become useless."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,banterchamp,5,Tue Jun 30 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"That would be super lame... It sounds like people on these forums might be the exception. ""Only 3% of players currently have 100% season score"". If that's the case I could see it being as good as last season."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,banterchamp,3,Tue Jun 30 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt they would give anyone someone like SR Sanders right off the bat. I remember for my first few weeks having one 87 OVR player was a pipe dream.  The difference with SR Sanders and Carter is that they were given as rewards for completing seasons (10?) and then EA pulled them, deciding the reward was too much. This new elite would be given to all with 100% immediately."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,turkmileymileyturk,2,Tue Jun 30 16:29:17 2015 UTC,Well if on 3% of players will get them it sounds comparable to the percentage of players that would have completed 10 seasons this past year.  In anycase I agree that a 99 might be a little much but an 87 is probably too low. Anyways we'll know in about another month I suppose.
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,turkmileymileyturk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed. I'd wager than far fewer than 3% got the 10 seasons before those rewards were removed, but you might be right.  I'm reasonably sure that the player we get will be 90 OVR max in any case. We shall see."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,turkmileymileyturk,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"What does ""No Trade"" mean???"
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,ZtheT,2,Tue Jun 30 16:21:45 2015 UTC,Dunno. Maybe they're adding a trade block like console has?
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,2,Tue Jun 30 16:26:52 2015 UTC,I'm curious how that will affect the market...
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,Chipaton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"well since they can't be auctioned I would think not much. SR Barry, Dom Sherman have very little effect on the market."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,Chipaton,2,Tue Jun 30 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant the ""trade block"" and how it will affect market prices."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,Chipaton,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:35:01 2015 UTC,oooh... yes that will be interesting. I don't think it will change things too much. I think most people will decide whether or not to take a trade based on market values. It will make things like moving cards between accounts and making deals through chat and forums much easier though.
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,westywall,2,Tue Jun 30 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one a little concerned about the fact they are calling it player items? Does that mean maybe it's a player, maybe a collectible that sucks? Why item?"
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,DrKoooolAid,2,Tue Jun 30 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Well I think they're just trying to be consistent with language. The bullet point below states ""Gold Item"" instead of ""Gold Player Item"". It seems to me then that ""Gold Item"" could include collectibles. ""Player Item"" then seems to me a player card."
MaddenMobileForums,3bn84i,UffaloIlls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:04:36 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Elite player item probably one Domination card for both Offense and Defense or something similar that you'll just pull dupes of later in the game.

MaddenMobileForums,3bn5bc,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:59 2015 UTC,true. He's fast AF.  His only problem really is height. And price.

MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,apollonese,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe since OBJ is the cover and possibly more Giants-themed, we can have an Eli card that isn't a total disaster. Still pisses me off his gold card sucks so much, and basically every other QB has a better version of theirs. I know it's Combine Warrior so kind of a specialty thing but even RG3 has a freakin 96 card and he's never done a single thing worth a damn in the NFL"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,SackRVC17,2,Tue Jun 30 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"the way he's played lately, Eli doesn't even crack the 80's"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Milsark23,2,Tue Jun 30 19:13:42 2015 UTC,yeah but he should have at least gotten like a rttr card like flacco or brees
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,FIFAforlife735,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:55:10 2015 UTC,He had a fine season last year. He's also the best qb in that division.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,EK22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:25:01 2015 UTC,He had a good season last year. I would predict for him to be 82-84 seeing as philip rivers is 84.

MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,theskyhooker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:47:01 2015 UTC,Eli has a 93 and a 96...  That are console exclusive.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,UffaloIlls,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"he's never done a single thing worth a damn in the NFL   How about the best rookie season for a QB in NFL history?  He averaged a 102.4 QB rating and rushed for 800 yards, winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.  How in the hell do you say he's never done anything worth a damn in the NFL?  Besides that, it's a Combine Warrior card.  That has to do with combine performance, not NFL capabilities.  RG3 deserves his card, and Eli Manning doesn't deserve anything better."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,EK22,3,Tue Jun 30 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"Besides that, it's a Combine Warrior card. That has to do with combine performance, not NFL capabilities.    True. There's even a Combine card for Percy Harvin. Even as a Bills fan, I think he's the WR equivalent of RG3: Talented, used on gimmicky plays, and always injured"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Milsark23,0,Tue Jun 30 22:40:46 2015 UTC,He lost his job to Kirk fucking Cousins
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,vN_GreeD,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:45:51 2015 UTC,It will be all about the Giants and OBJ.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Milsark23,2,Tue Jun 30 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"lets be honest here, just because OBJ won the cover vote does not mean all the sets will revolve around the Giants. Yes you can make the argument that because Sherman was on the last cover the game was about the Seahawks, but it was only about the Seahawks because they were the best team in the league. The Giants were awful last year and EA is smart enough to not base the sets around a team that did awful last year and probably not next year either."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Jason10005,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:58:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but New York has a bigger market than the New England area. They can make more money with obj.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Milsark23,-1,Wed Jul 1 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"If they wanted a big market, they'd go for the greatest, most awesome team in the league. And they'd slap Dez Bryant on the cover. DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS"
MaddenMobileForums,3bnv4m,Jason10005,0,Wed Jul 1 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"New York has a larger market than Dallas. Also, it was only between Odell and Gronk. And Dez is too controversial to be on the cover."

MaddenMobileForums,3bom8e,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 22:37:40 2015 UTC,I've seen that work
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,kavuong,2,Tue Jun 30 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"Looks ok to me. I would consider putting someone taller at WR2 for deep balls though. MM Calvin is a pretty great option. Then you could put Dez or OBJ in the slot.   Personally, for gameplay, I really like OBJ in the slot. Even more than Dez."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Tue Jun 30 17:21:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'll try Calvin when legend packs come out.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,PackersMadden,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:58 2015 UTC,Wow. Brown looks to be very expensive. Good luck man!
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,PackersMadden,2,Tue Jun 30 17:57:38 2015 UTC,Yep I'm praying that EA will show mercy and give gridiron packs. FE brown looks to be a monster.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yes he does. If we had Boss/24hrs cards on Mobile, Brown is just nothing compared to Boss Rice."
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jun 30 18:01:32 2015 UTC,No put brown in the slot. Dez at one and another WR at 2. Brown has 103 CIt meaning he is bound to be a slot receiver. He is also the shortest of that group.
MaddenMobileForums,3bnigq,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jun 30 20:04:22 2015 UTC,Brown's 99 SPD and 101 ACC make him very ideal for screens and end around at WR1. But I guess you could make arguments for both wr1 and slot. I'll have to mess around with that a bit.
MaddenMobileForums,3blmtu,mroc170,2,Tue Jun 30 05:37:37 2015 UTC,"here is the offense for the all bronze team! I'll go over why I chose these players: WR1: Holliday is actually a beast but he can't catch for shit, so I put him in the screen spot.  WR2: Wilson has decent receiver stats for a bronze but what sets him apart is 80 catch, to compensate for all the deep balls Holliday will drop slot: Palmer has pretty good speed and also decent hands, a balanced player TE: Loeffler won't be very valuable as a receiver, but he has beast blocking stats and 80 awareness QB: Thomas barely won over Joe Webb but I decided since I would be controlling the QB that his 41 awareness won't hurt me that much, plus his 82 speed is better than many elite QBs HB: I used dri archer on my main account until I had a 96 team and decided to upgrade to PH bell, he's awesome and has 95 speed FB: Harkey is just a beast blocker OTs: a solid LT and Mr.Legday himself in the other side OGs: both have blocking stats that average to over 75 and their awareness is significantly better than other bronze OGs C: same as OGs  so yeah, that's my offense. I have a decent scrambler who can lob the deep ball,a receiver who can catch it,a running back who can fly by defenders as long as they don't touch him, which they won't with such a cast of blockers. I think my offense turned out very well, feel free to share your opinions!"
MaddenMobileForums,3blmtu,FIFAforlife735,2,Tue Jun 30 05:49:12 2015 UTC,You should try out jeff demps. He always trucks and breaks tackles.
MaddenMobileForums,3blmtu,7heprofessor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to upload the picture of the defense so I'll just go over it here:  CB Sherrick Mcmanis: a 59 awr which is high among bronze CBs and decent coverage stats CB CJ Wilson: speed demon with bad awr but good coverage Safties: my starters are Josh Aubrey and Chris Maragos and my nickel/dime are Markelle Martin and Danny Mccray, there were a surprising amount of great safeties and I chose these ones for their unbalanced stats that make them big playmakers  DE Cornelius Washington: he has 86 power moves and 91 strength, so yeah... DE Malliciah Goodman: not as much of a beast but 60 awr and 80 tackle & hpwr make him pretty solid DT Torell Troup: 91 str and 81 pwr makes him a great run stopper DT Jermelle Cudjo: 65 awr just gives me confidence that his otherwise mediocre stats will be substantial  LB Ty Powell: he is a balanced LB with substantial awr MLB Moise Fokou: 71 awr and 81  hit power along with coverage in the mid 70s makes this mlb a dual threat MLB Julian Stanford: this guy looks more like a silver player and his 83 speed will help him dominate across the field My last linebacker? you guessed it, none other than Tim Fugger! this was more of a franchise decision to increase market size but I'm sure his 99 awr spd and str will be useful on D  so there's my defense, with a group of solid players and the joke of madden mobile himself, feel free to voice your opinions!"

MaddenMobileForums,3bmq2x,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Tue Jun 30 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"I think the team you choose affects the preferred defensive alignment in h2h and league games. I've noticed that certain teams (when not countering a play) tends to align more in 3-4 vs 4-3 formations, with the latter more common. 3-4 is more uncommon but Steelers and Patriots come to mind. When I notice this I try a HB Slam play since against a 4-3 it is always a -3 yrds."

MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,ZtheT,0,Tue Jun 30 15:47:11 2015 UTC,I suppose it does make sense with those with coins to sell not wanting to lose out on $$ when the coins go away due to the reset.
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,ZtheT,2,Mon Jun 29 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I want. Not enough coins yet :("
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,ZtheT,3,Mon Jun 29 21:36:55 2015 UTC,If we get new packs for 4th of July I'm gonna be pretty annoyed when the price tanks... but figured I might as well lock him in now if I want to make sure I get him before next season.  I'll try him out tonight and post a review tomorrow. Let you know if you're missing out ;)
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,PackersMadden,2,Mon Jun 29 21:43:59 2015 UTC,Def interested in your review. So far I have heard only good things from a few others.
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,ZtheT,2,Mon Jun 29 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"Well, hope he doesn't disappoint you. You still got 2 Mill left to burn on packs! Maybe you can pull Barry and make your money back? Who knows"
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,ZtheT,2,Mon Jun 29 22:06:08 2015 UTC,one can dream right? lol
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,AgentAnteater,2,Mon Jun 29 22:17:31 2015 UTC,Holy crap that deleted thread. Wtf.

MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:07 2015 UTC,Lol thanks. Slow day at work...
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 00:51:08 2015 UTC,"I saw a guy on Instagram who sold that. He was like, ""I can't believe anyone was stupid enough to buy him that high"". Well, I hope you like him."
MaddenMobileForums,3bk22j,Bvitamins1,2,Tue Jun 30 02:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hahaha yea time will tell I suppose. If new packs don't come out then it will have been a steal. Otherwise yea, I paid way too much =P  In anycase he's pretty sick so far..."
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,soenottelling,5,Tue Jun 30 03:35:38 2015 UTC,"honestly, get 99% in your season score and then sell your 30mil. i sold 30mil for $150 recently"
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,iceflamemaster,3,Tue Jun 30 03:53:07 2015 UTC,That's pretty cheap man. $5/Mill?
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,PackersMadden,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:01:59 2015 UTC,thats the bulk price bud. good luck getting 6+ in this market
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,iceflamemaster,3,Tue Jun 30 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"Steve young is pretty good. Doesn't fumble like Vick, throws perfect, but not as mobile as I would have liked."
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,BenjimanWa,3,Tue Jun 30 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"The best card that you need to get is mm Barry sanders. Get him, lol."
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"So overall yah that's it. Legacy team only works in special live events so almost never. Multiple new MMs have come out including Atwater, Barry sanders, jerry rice, watt, suh, peppers etc. Prices are actually rising atm due to no new packs. So might want to sell soon to get best price or wait it or and see."
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,BenjimanWa,2,Tue Jun 30 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"Prices have indeed dropped, big time. Some cards are worth half what they once were. The AH is out of wack due to the best cards rising in prices and all others dropping since everyone wants to maximize their ovr, or score. Quite a few new cards have come out, completely altering the lineup for the ""perfect tema"". MM Barry Sanders is widely regarded as the best back but is extremely pricey. A new QB for top tier teams is 99 FE Andrew Luck , who replaced Honors Rodgers. Quite a few MMs have emerged but with 31 million you can still do a bit.  Hope this helped, any other questions just PM me."
MaddenMobileForums,3blajp,yamepo,2,Tue Jun 30 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"With your 31 Mill coins, I recommend selling it around $6.50/Mill at /r/maddenmobilebuysell. As long as you don't get scammed nor you don't sell it for too low, you'll get at least $180. :)"
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,kwrocket,3,Tue Jun 30 04:22:06 2015 UTC,MM Adrian Peterson. I would say he has the best truck in the game to be honest.
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Tue Jun 30 15:48:35 2015 UTC,Yep he definitely is a beast at both.
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:23 2015 UTC,Barry Sanders.
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,Ryan5427,9,Tue Jun 30 04:49:45 2015 UTC,Can I borrow 30 million?
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,Ryan5427,2,Tue Jun 30 05:02:23 2015 UTC,I saw on a different thread that Barry is worth like $150 if you bought the coins haha
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Tue Jun 30 05:24:58 2015 UTC,Doh!
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,DowntownPumpkin,2,Tue Jun 30 05:25:57 2015 UTC,MM Barry only Agility trucks actually. Not both. Still a monster though.
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,turkmileymileyturk,2,Tue Jun 30 15:49:04 2015 UTC,mm lynch
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 05:22:19 2015 UTC,Melvin Gordon has the best truck in the game IMO (strength+agility). He is just plagued by the Draft speed ratings....
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,UffaloIlls,0,Tue Jun 30 05:40:48 2015 UTC,Ignore strength truck.  AGI is where it's at.
MaddenMobileForums,3blfo3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:43 2015 UTC,Who do you think does that best? I totally agree. Hate backs that only strength truck.
MaddenMobileForums,3bl91g,BMorg1,3,Tue Jun 30 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, how in the world did you get all those collectibles? That is like impossible. I would get Poe. He's good in my starting lineup and I think he sells for a pretty penny as well. I haven't really checked though."
MaddenMobileForums,3bl91g,JacobKHD,2,Tue Jun 30 03:31:26 2015 UTC,I got really lucky with 40 yard dash cards I'm not exactly sure how to be honest.

MaddenMobileForums,3bl91g,BenjimanWa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:20:51 2015 UTC,Gonna be honest. Almost all of the combine warriors are not worrying keeping. Just sell them and pick up better cheaper players.
MaddenMobileForums,3bjy54,TimHepp,6,Mon Jun 29 20:55:35 2015 UTC,Depends. What position will they be playing. Calvin is better for the 1 or the 2 WR because of how tall he is. OBJ is better in the slot because he's faster and smaller.
MaddenMobileForums,3bjy54,Xrtcoletrain,3,Mon Jun 29 20:57:57 2015 UTC,My fault outside/one. Thanks for the input

MaddenMobileForums,3bi570,PackersMadden,3,Mon Jun 29 13:18:36 2015 UTC,That wasn't because of lack of packs it was because of a coin glitch

I'm just hoarding coins, what I was flipping a week ago are now posted at insane prices, I don't think anyone is actually buying at those though? For example I used to be able to buy 2 certain cards that had been around for a while. 1 for around 300-325k and then sell at about 375-390k for a nice profit usually around 40k average. There are none in AH for below low 400's and I haven't seen any sell over that either. I had another I could usually acquire for below 400 or just above and it was a 90% sell rate at 500. now most in AH are priced over 600, and I can't believe they are actually selling. So I'm gonna be hoarding my 35M coins."

You should be able to replace Reggie White with Bruce Smith for a small amount of coins, maybe even make a profit. I think Reggie sells in the upper 300k range, something like 375k. You can get Bruce Smith for about that amount. I actually see him for 325k fairly often. Revis and Hall would be nice to replace, but that will cost you more coins."

MaddenMobileForums,3besgz,NkNick,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"Get 98 Greg Robinson- he sells for 215k- after tax you'll have 273.5k total.  You can get 83 OVR CBs for 5k each and 83+ OVR Safetys for 5k each- 25k to have a secondary of all 83+'s  83 and 84 LBs (and MLBs) cost 5k each, too- 20k to replace your LBs.  DTs are about the same as LBs- 10k for two of them.  84-85 DEs are easy to pick up at 5k each- 5k to replace T. Alalu.  Cost of bringing your D to ~84: 55k.  However, you'll probably want some splashy players. You should be able to get two for your defense. Some ideas:  CB: 93 FB Champ Bailey (+1 Catch) 40k.   LB: 92 FB Demarcus Ware (+1 Tackle): 35k-45k.  Safety: 94 TOTY Antoine Bethea: 55k-70k.  D-end: 92 FO Michael Bennet:~35k (worth it just for the picture) or Draft Owamagbe Odighizuwa (+1 Acceleration): 55-70k (worth it just for the name)  D-tackle: 93 FO Vince Wilfork: 55k-75k (worth it for the 99 Strength and 98 Power Moves)  Remember, you should be able to get one or two of these.  So 55k for starters+~100k for superstars=155k, or 123k left for your offense (which is normally cheaper on everything except the o-line).  Other than ""Fuck the o-line shit's expensive"" I know nothing about offense, and if you decide to wade into the hell that is upgrading Special Teams, God help you. God help us all."
MaddenMobileForums,3besgz,TheNewJerry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:49:15 2015 UTC,Mine:  I've done Von and Greg and was thinking of doing the new safety Deone (my current safeties are 94 FE Iloka and 94 TOTY Bethea- Imgur won't work)  I already have 160k banked- if I sell Deone will I have enough to get PH Bell- and is he worth it (right now I have 94 Draft Yeldon and 92 FO Shane Vereen)?
MaddenMobileForums,3besgz,TheNewJerry,2,Sun Jun 28 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"I have PH bell, and while he can truck, he is slow, I can't go for long td runs because most defensive backs can catch him. I find that the draft rbs are fast af, so I would keep Deone as a db."

MaddenMobileForums,3bbmoj,vollkoemmenes,2,Sat Jun 27 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that is the weird thing. I managed to get the first pass about half of the time to my low catching ability Hester.   But the third pass to my guy with 99 catching and jumping was failing every time.   I tried it again this afternoon and it was vastly easier for some reason. Of course, all I got for my trouble was an almost worthless collectible."
MaddenMobileForums,3bbmoj,xKizume,3,Sun Jun 28 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Took me 3 tries, I couldn't see my HB on the right because of the screen FOV and it took me a while until I got it right. Plus sometimes I'd get sacked or th corners would be right on my WR1 and WR2 so yeah it was more difficult."

MaddenMobileForums,3bbmoj,FUBARRRRR,2,Sun Jun 28 00:14:03 2015 UTC,Did it on the 2nd try with my 86 ovr team. Lob the deeps and bullet the shorts. Move your qb left and right to get better angles and avoid the straightline interception
MaddenMobileForums,3bbmoj,ciesum,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"I got it my first attempt with my 91 ovr all 49ers team. I've struggled with others, like the hb dive on the moving zone especially. For the FL drag I always throw to the right receiver and start the play as the zone is about 1/2 way on the way to the left and bullet it to my receiver."
MaddenMobileForums,3bbmoj,victortrash,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"You mean like the ultimate BS where you're at the 1, with 2 seconds to go, choose PA TE drag, throw to the open HB for a TD, and get that shitty connection problem, so you have to do it again.  And on the 4th time, when it doesn't give you that connection problem, they blitz a CB before you get a chance to do anything, take a sack, end of game.  You mean that kind of hard time?"

MaddenMobileForums,3bcaik,xKizume,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:27:23 2015 UTC,That is odd. Rumor has it though that a lot of the players that have been lazy/hoarding are finally getting around to clearing their benches now that there's only a month and a half left before the reset.  That could account for what you're seeing...

TBH, faulk is good, but he's a bit slow for me.  1 tip I have for you is this:  To make a quick buck, you can easily buy 2 K/P Position Collectables.  This will cost you 900k total (450k each). Then, if you havent already completed the K/P set, complete it to make Janakowski and Hekker.  Hekker will net 7-800k and Jano will get you 500k+ so thats a few 100k profit"
MaddenMobileForums,3bcaj0,Ryan5427,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah the one for 1.9 million coins got sold in a couple of minutes after posting, wished I took that price. Also thanks for the Murray heads up, he brought a good chunk of money in for me, plus I got a chance to clear my bench which took a long ass time. Had to check each players price on my other phone, at least that's what I did for most of the elites. I already did the K/P set, I pulled one of the collectible in the gridiron and bought the other one, made a nice profit! However that was a while ago and Hekker was like sub 400k, now his price is sky high. I just want to see if Bo lives up to his hype and his stats, fallback is Faulk but yeah I had him before and I wasn't impressed by his speed.  Edit: Just got Bo for 1.75 million, going to test him out"

MaddenMobileForums,3b9s1p,ky27,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"Ok. How much advice do you want?  I can give you a whole page's worth if you want...  Ok, since you're low on coins, I'd ditch Lynch unless you really like him. Sell and get yourself a million or so, I think (check AH, I'm not sure) pick up 99 Demarco Murray.  He's great and cheaper.  This frees up an extra 500k at least.  With that extra money, you could try to start sniping. positional collectables and gold trophies are my thing, but really anything that's profitable (pay attention to AH tax) works...  Well, ok, assuming you only have ~600k to work with, I'd make Von Miller with that combine set.  Get yourself (or make yourself) PH Harrison Smith and but 99 Kam Chancellor. Thats the combo I use and it works great!  Your secondary needs work in a lot of other areas, but since you've got a slim budget, I'd hold off for now.  As for DLine, Combine Poe is a cheap upgrade for DT, but if you can get either Honors Donald or FE Marcell Dareus (both 98s) for cheap (less than 200k), then get them instead/as well.    For Offense, Oline is your biggest need.  For Center Kory Lichtensteiger  or Travis Frederick are great options. Oh well, I tried to stay under budget, but you might need a bit more $...  Anyway, ditch Shannon Sharpe and sidegrade for Honors Gronk or TOTY Olsen. Both are drastic improvements in terms of gameplay. You need a better WR too, but I'm not sure which one is the best fit for you.  Just because I'm a Bills fan, I love easter legend Andre Reed. He's a great deep threat and great in the run game. He might be a bit pricey, so I'm gonna veer you away from him and towards one of the many awesome, cheap Combine Warriors.  In general, the combine players are your friend. While I know you only have one complete set, they are so cheap you could easily pick up a few extras on the AH.  Pierre Garcon and Brandin Cooks will replace Stills and Carter nicely. It might seem odd, but I'd put 98 Cooks on the outside instead or 99 Garcon because Garcon is a beast in the slot.   I wish I could suggest further upgrades, but for now, that has to be it (time and $ constraints). Hope it helps!"
MaddenMobileForums,3b9e8k,NakedTaco,3,Sat Jun 27 01:29:34 2015 UTC,They're already all over the market. The price probably won't drop much. You could probably get one for a little bit over 300.

MaddenMobileForums,3b9e8k,ZtheT,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"Legends that are usually more rare will have fluctuating prices. The price for Smith shouldn't drop too much, as lots of people have in and around the 300k range for coins, and and there are lots on the market, so the prices for Smith won't drop, as people will continuously buy the lowest ones, not allowing it to drop.  On the other hand, something like Peppers where there are less people with millions will drop a bit. Not many will be able to afford it as is, so no one really has to worry about the current cheapest being bought, therefore others try to put theirs up cheaper, lowering the price until someone feels that it's safe to buy."

MaddenMobileForums,3b8f76,Dubzil,2,Fri Jun 26 20:23:59 2015 UTC,No sets can really get you 95 players except the combine ones.
MaddenMobileForums,3b8f76,gimpisgawd,2,Fri Jun 26 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"if you haven't already completed them, the team sets are profitable.   another way to make money is sniping elite/gold players and making the collectables. either flipping the collectables for marginal profit, or making the player and improving your team vastly.  another tip if you have 2 devices, is using one device for a guest account and completing a few achievements in H2H mode and selling the LQS profits to yourself. there are youtube videos to better explain this. (i've gotten 250k at least 4 times, and 500k once, so it can be very profitable)"

MaddenMobileForums,3b8f76,EK22,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:16:51 2015 UTC,Yeah the team sets are worth it just for the coins you get every time... Also do 10 of the Team MVP sets so you can get 98 Earl Thomas

I'm honestly not exaggerating in the slightest. It may be closer to 60 now as I've stopped counting exactly how many.  So much coin wasted.   Best:  daily warm-up to finish the set like I do every 7 days and buying a pro pack with the $7500. Hit reveal all and seeing this beautiful 99 Nick Mangold sitting dead center of the row. It was divine.

It was the first time I had gotten anything good in packs and it was the first time I could brag about my team to anyone else. I started late, so my team was very weak compared to those of my friends.  Second to that was when I found this subreddit. If you look through my post history, I almost exclusively post here.

First play, crazy interior pressure, and Robert Quinn gets a strip sack and returns it for a TD. Now it's the fourth quarter, and I'm passed. There are 7 seconds left, and I go for the PA streaks. I think it's open. Then, Rodney McLeod happens. The man who would lead me to the greatest dynasty of all time, makes the most miraculous pick in madden history. He then provides to juke everyone out and returns it for a touchdown. That's my worst memory. Gg Rodney  Best is when the TOTY promo came out, and I said, man that would be cool to pull one of those.

I could call an engage eight blitz and everyone gets pancaked so that Tate can run in for an easy score.   Best moment was beating the Browns in the playoffs that season by 25+ points. I was thinking I might actually lose the playoffs this time, seeing as the Browns always go beast mode on me.

MaddenMobileForums,3b7tfb,DeadToWrites,2,Fri Jun 26 18:44:23 2015 UTC,Most Bills fans are pretty adamant that we are the only NY team.  It would be like saying the Chiefs play in Kansas.

MaddenMobileForums,3b7tfb,SackRVC17,2,Fri Jun 26 20:16:33 2015 UTC,i would say most fans outside buffalo consider the bills not to be a new york team bc buffalo is so far away from the other ny teams and the majority play in nyc so really new york teams means nyc teams (although technically jets/giants don play there) and bills/sabres are buffalo's team or new york state's team

MaddenMobileForums,3b79ly,noobcake01,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"I think at this point it would be beneficial to replace your draft players with cards with base 99. Here's what I recommend:  For your combine sets, definitely make greg Robinson and the new 99 safety. Offensive guards are expensive so that will be a nice easy upgrade over A.J. Cann. Replace Landon Collins at nickel with the other combine player. Next you should complete the ph sets for Joe Thomas and Ricky Wagner to replace your current OTs. They can be made for about 500k each quite easily. Next, replace Maxwell at dime. I recommend Rod Woodson at safety then bump ET3 to nickel and combine player at dime. Woodson is a beast for gameplay. Another good upgrade to make would be replacing William Perry at fullback. I strongly recommend getting Bo. I know it will be pricey but I can't stress enough how much of a beast he is for gameplay in both the passing and running game. With whatever money you have left added to the money made from selling your current players you should replace Desmond Trufant. An easy fix could be ph pat Pete. He is cheap and good for covering screen passes. Hope this helps"

MaddenMobileForums,3b79ly,tmpkiwi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:08:17 2015 UTC,You should be able to get most of it because after selling the players you replace you will get some money back. Not sure if u can get pat Pete tho

MaddenMobileForums,3b79ly,UffaloIlls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Defense  You definitely need to upgrade Dline for starters.  Bruce Smith and/or MJG would help out a lot. DE actually is more of a priority.  Also you need a replacement for Earl Thomas at FS.  Harrison Smith is a great FS for very cheap.  Ed Reed is cheapish (less than 1mil) and could play either FS or SS.  So one of those 2 guys would be great.  For now, I wouldnt worry too much about your LBs.  Offense  As for Offense, in terms of positioning, OBJ is better in the slot than Sanders. You could just replace Sanders all together.  I'm not sure how expensive 99 Demaryius is right now, but he is amazing stat wise.  He would work perfectly in the slot with 100 CIT, 99 Catch and 99 speed.  An alternative is Pierre Garcon, who isnt great for overall, but is very cheap (especially today, when combine live events are on). He has 96 speed, 99 catch and 100 CIT.  Catch in Traffic (CIT) by the way is very important for slot WRs, as a lot of the routes asked of them are posts or slants and the need to catch contested throws.    You probably should upgrade TE (Honestly if you want, you could ignore my advice on WRs and throw Bennet in the slot). Jimmy Graham is a budget beast (350k).  He catches pretty much everything thrown to him.  Also, on your budget, it might not be wise to throw more than 500k on any one player.  If you want to take a risk, get MM Gronk. He is the undisputed GOAT at TE.  and his cost is around 1.5 - 1.7mil.  Your Oline needs work, so I'd work my way towards PH Joe Thomas by buying PH collectables or better yet, by doing the PH sets and making the collectables. 100 PBK is great. Wagner is another option for PH. he isnt as good, but he has better RBK than Thomas.  For OG, you can do the same thing and get yourself PH Kyle Long. At the other OG slot you could put Combine Robinson, who will no doubt be boosted to a 99 on your team.  PH Miller is around 300-400k and would be a great FB for your team. I prefer Franco Harris a bit, but either guy is fine. Harris is at 100k ish."
MaddenMobileForums,3b79ly,UffaloIlls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"BTW, I calculated, and If I'm correct about player pricing, this plan could cost as little as 2.3mil"

MaddenMobileForums,3b78fq,banterchamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:27:36 2015 UTC,I actually throw to the slot. I like OBJ in the slot he always gets his head around and makes play on the ball.   I never threw to #2 outside (left WR) before Megatron.   I recently got Megatron over PH Jones.   Now I throw bombs to Megatron here and there and he pulls it down.   So basically using Megatron as my #2 out wide has opened up the playbook.   I'm pretty happy with that set up.

It's not an area I want to fully study and invest my time in, because my gain is just to sell one card.

MaddenMobileForums,3b6kxf,lagoon9,3,Fri Jun 26 11:32:47 2015 UTC,"whats your budget? without knowing that it isn't possible to provide advice, but you have three gold linemen, I would start there."
MaddenMobileForums,3b6kxf,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,2,Fri Jun 26 12:11:05 2015 UTC,Sorry. I could get around 100k pretty soon I guess
MaddenMobileForums,3b6kxf,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,2,Fri Jun 26 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"not much to work with and you don't want to burn it all, all three of your olinemen positions (dt, og and c) get expensive at the 90+ level. if you get really lucky you may be able to snipe some for 50k and get 2 but it is unlikely. I'm a proponent of improving defense first since you don't control that in h2h and league play, maybe target the 94dt aaron donald, or look for a draft player one with a team boost (str, spd, acc, agi not pbk, rbk etc), not sure if there is one that is still cheap. if you wait for gridiron packs donalds price will drop due to increased supply. you might also snipe the original legends rookie cards for center mike webster and guard gene upshaw and then spend 15k for the trophies and cards and do the sets, but there aren't a lot of those cards around anymore, but that also means you might be able to get one real cheap because people don't know how to price them in ah. you could probably sell the upgraded legends card for a decent profit if you don't want to use them in your lineup."

MaddenMobileForums,3b5qmp,ConfusedAlgerian,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of any of the draft players. I think their ratings are vastly overrated for not having played a down yet in the NFL, the highest Peyton Manning card is a 92 and these guys are 94+? That and the card art is just plain ugly, reminds me of a 70's bachelor pad wall paper pattern.  But back to your question ... it depends on your coin stash. If you are on a budget the 99 Von Miller combine would be a decent LB for you, or the Ryan Shazier combine at MLB. You can probably build a PH LB for less than buying one, I would go with Collins as he has better coverage. James Harrison SB is another budget option but probably better in the 3-4 where you may not want to spend money and I'm pretty sure that the recently released 99 Deandre Levy will come down in price to around those two cards.  As for DT, McCoy and MJG are comparable, it would come down to price, and I think you could probably do the McCoy PH set for a decent amount less than buying the MJG so he would be more cost effective."

MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,DrKoooolAid,3,Thu Jun 25 20:23:23 2015 UTC,If you've been gone that long you probably don't know that they fixed the slot receiver glitch. You should put a tight end in for Patterson.
MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,Hiel0s,2,Thu Jun 25 21:21:29 2015 UTC,Any suggestions on who?
MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,Hiel0s,2,Thu Jun 25 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"If you can afford MM TEs, I'd go with Gronk, who is definitely the GOAT as of now, followed by Kellen Winslow and Mike Ditka in that order. If you can't afford any of those, get Shannon Sharpe. Antonio Gates' MM is not that great so don't try for him. Take either Gronk, Winslow, Ditka or Sharpe and replace Jimmy Graham with him. Then put Jimmy Graham in the slot."
MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,Hiel0s,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:35:12 2015 UTC,Thanks. Any suggestions for my defense? Or special teams?
MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,Stuchu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:38:33 2015 UTC,"For special teams, the obvious choice is to pick up Hekker for the season rewards and to flaunt your maxed out special teams. As for defense, swap Deacon and White for JPP and Bruce Smith, this should cost almost nothing if you sell White and Deacon afterwards. JPP and Bruce Smith are the second and third best DEs, and you can't afford Peppers (maybe if you wait, but there's only 7 weeks left). Also, it's worth noting that all PHs are cheaper if you make them instead of buy them, so we're going to operate on the assumption that your PHs are made, not bought. For your DTs, sell Aaron Donald and make Gerald Mccoy, who can be made for just under 400k, put MJG in the 4-3 and Mccoy in the DT position. Make Vontae and replace Porter. Get a new linebacker, Lawrence Taylor or Derrick Brooks. Lastly, pick up Ed Reed, replace Kam Chancellor with him, replace ET3 with Kam, and sell ET3 (strength boosts aren't worth much). If you have any money after this, I'd be happy to help out. I think if you're smart with your coins, you can have around 500k-1mil left, but I'm just approximating."
MaddenMobileForums,3b43mx,UffaloIlls,2,Thu Jun 25 23:58:16 2015 UTC,Awareness boosts aren't really needed anymore so you can put any WR in the slot

FB Sproles along with a Draft HB is a good combo for running. Honors Gronkowski or TOTY Greg Olsen are both solid Tight Ends. Try to also get TOTY Boling. Replace Eric Reid with Rodney McLeod. Some Draft MLBs, LBs,  and CBs,  such as Paul Dawson,  Benardrick McKinney and Byron Jones could help your LB core and secondary.

Just get the Collins PH, and slide Von Miller into the 3/4 spot and sell Ryan. However I would suggest that you get a 99 coverage safety and move ET3 to the dime spot. Harrison Smith would be your budget option there, preferably MM Ed Reed or Easter Rod Woodson. Possibly the flashback 98 Ed Reed but he is costly.  Then also switch Dom Sherman with Pat Pete as I read somewhere, and tried it out myself, that Dom Sherman evaluates much better for your overall in CB spot than in nickel. You could probably sell Pat Pete for more than a 99 coverage safety would cost and then have some coins left over. You could keep ET3 in the nickel spot because he is a good safety that can cover a TE or WR in the slot. Generally safeties in the nickel and dime slots are supposed to evaluate better for your team overall rating than CBs."

MaddenMobileForums,3b3997,ZtheT,2,Fri Jun 26 14:39:10 2015 UTC,I would replace greg Robinson with TOTY Clint boling. His overall is lower but his blocking is more evened out and his awareness is much higher.

It's set your counters and then cross your fingers. No one has a specific defensive scheme. Not only this, but an MM card is usually superior to a PH card, but PH Houston outclasses Ware pretty easily on defense. http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/6091/3539  They are both the same type of OLB, a pass rusher, and yet Houston is the obvious winner."
MaddenMobileForums,3b37xl,turkmileymileyturk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"Um, dude, some teams have a 3-4 base and some teams have a 4-3 base and that affects your counter plays in H2H. Levy plays for a 4-3 base team. 99% of you dudes don't even NFL or football. DeMarcus Ware would be a DE in a 4-3 base defense, not a OLB. Two different positions. This is basic football.  EDIT:  (combining the two replies)  Also, Houston and Ware play the same position (and Houston should be the better card at this point in both of their careers but that's neither here nor there). You can tell the difference between a 4-3 OLB and a 3-4 OLB in that the 4-3 OLB is expected to play coverage and a 3-4 OLB is expected rush the passer, set the edge, or cover the flats. This is why they have different coverage stats."

MaddenMobileForums,3b1qoy,afxdub,2,Thu Jun 25 17:00:49 2015 UTC,Sorry. I meant max score for the seasons part of the score. 7 complete seasons will get you the max 25% toward Season Score.

MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,FIFAforlife735,7,Thu Jun 25 03:37:42 2015 UTC,Under team category complete the sets also called team for all 32 teams. You actually make a profit if you buy and sell for the right price and it counts as 32 sets for season score if you do all of them.
MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,tmpkiwi,2,Thu Jun 25 03:40:58 2015 UTC,Yeah im doing those. Which one of those are the best?
MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,3,Thu Jun 25 03:43:45 2015 UTC,Best? None of them. They're all the same price to complete and the same reward.

MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,vollkoemmenes,2,Thu Jun 25 13:04:46 2015 UTC,It says that only non repeatable sets count foe season score.
MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,ZtheT,2,Thu Jun 25 14:45:02 2015 UTC,"Most of these are not repeatable. These are the ones that they have for most positions that you can do only once. For example, the bronze one takes 5 bronze players and 5 bronze trophies and gets you a silver trophy and silver player. Oddly, a couple of random ones happen to be repeatable."
MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,Why_So-Serious,2,Thu Jun 25 14:59:36 2015 UTC,Is it a random silver player or position specific?
MaddenMobileForums,3b17mn,Dubzil,2,Thu Jun 25 20:51:42 2015 UTC,Position specific.
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,Why_So-Serious,11,Wed Jun 24 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"How about not having the auction sold, auction expired, you have been outbid messages pop up right were the dollar amounts are and mess you up while you're working the AH."
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,ZtheT,3,Wed Jun 24 20:44:06 2015 UTC,Good one.
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,twjohns97,10,Wed Jun 24 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Legitimate QB scrambling. You can do it if you're good at it, but if I have Vick or Wilson or even Combine Kap or RG3, I want to be able to take OFF when i see pressure. Accuracy would drop on the run, but make it to where QBs don't take 7 years to escape the pocket."
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,twjohns97,3,Wed Jun 24 21:02:10 2015 UTC,I'm deleting to EA on this one. I too would like to QB Scramble but for whatever reason they choose to take it out of the game.   The list above is more annoyances that can be fixed rather than philosophical differences.
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"It's an improvement that EA should install. Some of the things this list consists of are knit-picking, at least mine would make a significant contribution.   Some of the things like changing the place of a box would be convenient, but is more about people being lazy than anything else. What EA should most importantly improve is the gameplay, which I was pointing out a negative aspect of."
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,Skywarp79,2,Wed Jun 24 22:10:52 2015 UTC,Spamming QB scrambles isn't  1.) representative of actual NFL game play  2.) A game play improvement.   I have Russell Wilson too.  I'd love to take off when the LBs leave in coverage.  The way the defense plays it would be easy to break off huge runs.   Which is probably why it is specifically removed from game play.   Not having to click 6 times from Sets to AH improves my life by saving minutes (probably days when I was doing RTTP)
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 22:31:27 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that clicking from AH to sets is annoying. I always get slowed down by forgetting AH and sets are in different tabs
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,dubsallday,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"It would be easy to do, too. Pressing Skill Move while in the pocket should have the QB tuck the ball and run normally."
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,ciesum,2,Thu Jun 25 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"good idea. It could change to a ""Scramble Button"" in the pocket, but switch back to ""Skill move""  when you hit the LOS.  They have this in NFL pro 2015"
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,Skywarp79,4,Thu Jun 25 18:09:33 2015 UTC,Auto fill for sets like player and trophy upgrades
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,Pseudonova,2,Wed Jun 24 21:05:54 2015 UTC,Yes Super annoying - especially in the combine sets.

MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,MrSkimMilk,2,Thu Jun 25 01:44:29 2015 UTC,I had Brady throw one 30 yards backwards out of bounds from the pocket one time when I blitzed and got to him. Incomplete pass.
MaddenMobileForums,3azk8v,durkadurkdurka,5,Thu Jun 25 16:25:47 2015 UTC,I'd like to see penalties applied and enforced.. holding and pass interference ESPECIALLY. Also network times outs are my pet peeve.

Usually I look to buy for 40k or less and sell for 53k (for positions like LB, MLB, CB, DT).  It doesnt seem incredibly profitable unless I get an OT or OG for cheap. should I price them higher?"
MaddenMobileForums,3az02x,ZtheT,2,Wed Jun 24 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"For LB, MLB, and CB, you're not going to get much more. 55k seems to be the norm, so I undercut it at 54k. But DTs you are doing it all wrong. I get 69k for those all day. Keep in mind the market has not fully recovered yet. As for profitable, my theory is that it all adds up. I had a run of DTs that cost 45k yesterday. I got almost 50 of them. 17k times 50 is 850k."

MaddenMobileForums,3azu8q,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:36 2015 UTC,The easiest way is to just setup quicktime as if you're going to record the screen.

MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,kwrocket,4,Wed Jun 24 16:27:23 2015 UTC,I've never used Lynch but my favorite of the other 3 is Faulk. His cuts are flawless plus he boosts your whole team.
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,Ryan5427,2,Wed Jun 24 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"I have not used Lynch, but I have had the other 3. I prefer Bo. But Honors Murray and Faulk are good as well. I'd say Murray is a poor man's Bo. Faulk has a different set of skils. Love his AGI, because he cuts corners real well. But not as fast or strong as Bo."
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,ZtheT,2,Wed Jun 24 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always wanted to get Faulk but because Bo is so good in the passing game, he's always there to help me win h2h games. How good is Faulk in terms of catching and running routes?"
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,womtei,2,Wed Jun 24 18:23:09 2015 UTC,He's got 90 catch i believe.
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"yeah i just did a compare between the two and besides the base stats, they are pretty close to each other. I've read that Faulk has better acceleration than Bo, but I could be wrong"
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,womtei,2,Wed Jun 24 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"Bo is great, but he has a hitch in his truck. I prefer to use FB Faulk"
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,westywall,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"I've used Bo, Faulk, Murray and Lynch. Honestly, I prefer Murray. Murray uses both strength and agility trucks, he's good for overall, and he is fairly cheap. I prefer Murray over Bo solely for the fact of the agility trucks. Faulk is a really good HB as well, but again, is fairly expensive. My choice is Murray, unless you have the money, then I'd go with Bo."
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,Syth1579,2,Wed Jun 24 19:14:49 2015 UTC,murray is probably the best hb for his price. i don't really like bo just because he always uses strength truck.
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,maddenmaster,2,Wed Jun 24 20:15:37 2015 UTC,Adrian Peterson. If it has to be from the list then Bo would be my second choice.
MaddenMobileForums,3ayu36,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Wed Jun 24 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"If you pass to HB a lot, get 98 Faulk. He has the best RTE stat of all RBs (better than 99 Faulk)"

MaddenMobileForums,3azbc0,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe. I'd first ditch PH Bell for a better HB. And fix the TE. At least get TOTY olsen or Honors Gronk.  I would tell you to swap out Romo, but you probably like him, so dont worry about that. Put 98 Franco or PH Miller at FB. How many coins do you have?"
MaddenMobileForums,3azbc0,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 18:50:33 2015 UTC,Not much I think 12k but I have a lot tied up in ah. Which rb do you recommend. I personally do not like ph bell I used to use 94 Justin Forsett. Imo forsett is a lot better but lower ovr.
MaddenMobileForums,3azbc0,UffaloIlls,3,Wed Jun 24 18:53:32 2015 UTC,"Forsett is much better, youre right.  If you sell Bell, that would net you 350k + with which you could buy 99 Demarco Murray.  Or you could downgrade and save by buying TOTW Lynch (98) or 98 Franco Harris. Both are very good Powerbacks and they cost ~100k."
MaddenMobileForums,3azbc0,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Murray is the best cheap HB. Unfortunately Emmit Smith isnt too great unless you want to try him at FB, but that would cost more than is necessary."
MaddenMobileForums,3azbc0,bundleofsocks,2,Wed Jun 24 19:01:41 2015 UTC,Ok thanks man appreciate that
MaddenMobileForums,3azxu2,LecMalenza,3,Wed Jun 24 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"Get yourself Demarco Murray's 99 card.  He's pretty versatile, and only costs about 3-4 hundred k.  Franco Harris can be put in your flex and that will only cost 100k.  Also Ditch Inhedigbo for PH Harrison Smith and buy 99 Kam Chancellor as well.  Von Miller is cheap too.  For pretty cheap you can upgrade kicker and get yourself Gotskoski or Mason Crosby.  Also ditch Calias Cambell. He sucks. For cheap you can get yourself Bruce Smith or another 99 DE."
MaddenMobileForums,3azxu2,UffaloIlls,2,Wed Jun 24 21:22:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the idea. He's up there for 489.5k so I will have to wait on that if he goes for 300-400k.

Why do you reccommend ditching Idhegibo? i was able to snag Kam at 260k, seemed like a good deal.

MaddenMobileForums,3ayrpj,ZtheT,3,Wed Jun 24 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind losing some fans, what you can do is come out in the Onside Recovery formation and when the ball is kicked off, move your kick returner away from the ball. If the ball lands in the endzone and the opponent recovers, you will get the achievement. Same for season mode.   Punt returning is hella hard but I got it in Season 1 with FA Eric Page."
MaddenMobileForums,3ayrpj,Robotsaur,2,Wed Jun 24 17:50:55 2015 UTC,The easiest way to return kickoffs is from the safety kick
MaddenMobileForums,3ayrpj,DeadToWrites,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:46:17 2015 UTC,I used to be able to return safety kicks for touchdowns super easily but for some reason I can't anymore. I think I had 3 or 4 safety return touchdowns in one game a few months ago but when I try it now it seems more like a punt return where I can't get more than 10 yards
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,2,Wed Jun 24 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"Usually you just look for people taking a really long time between plays. Particularly 2pt conversion. That being said there is no way to ""prove"" force closing. I find it's usually best to just suck it up and not be one of the d-bags throwing around wild accusations. Rarely will people admit to it and it just makes the accuser look petty.  Also, with the latest timeout issues you really can't tell anymore. People might be force closing or just getting timed out. I for one got timed out 3 times in a row this morning and just gave up."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Wed Jun 24 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"I usually get an inkling if there are no countered plays grouped with a wide variety of plays ran. When you have maxed out Defensive slots, the probability of not running into a countered play is slim.  The one caveat to this is if one play is successful and they run the gamut on it.   But really no way to tell."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,Beerstratta,2,Wed Jun 24 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what got me thinking about it as a possibility. Somehow these sub 100 offenses are shredding my league's 100+ defenses in just a few plays with almost NOTHING ever countered.  No one is spamming the same play either.  The drive stats look like kick return, and then just 1 or 2 plays for a TD.   Edit:  They're ALWAYS for huge yards and they always score 24 points.  It's infuriating."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,Beerstratta,2,Wed Jun 24 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, most likely force closing. We played a league that was in the low 80's and every player had 24 points and there were 3 counters among every play ran.  I also joined a league who demanded you force quit until you scored. I left it quick. What's the point."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,acousticdank,2,Wed Jun 24 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"There is also some leveling because I sometimes find it easier to score on my 80 offense,  even against a 105. Also, if a player is good as long as they have a decent qb, rb, and wr1, you can pretty much score at will. There are a lot of alts out there."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,ZtheT,2,Wed Jun 24 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"Good question. I also wonder if you can tell the difference between force closing and these darn timeout issues. More often than not, it's a good play that I made, which sucks, but occasionally I get a timeout on a bad play I made."
MaddenMobileForums,3axwwt,flacco2014,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky situation to spot those who do force quit. I once quit a league because they encourage you to use it and even got mad when they see that you couldn't get all the 2-pts conversion.

MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,Why_So-Serious,3,Wed Jun 24 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"Love the team. It's almost the same as mine haha  Personally, I like Mega over Julio but not at all a fan of Deion. If anything maybe upgrade one of your DB's and ditch PP from the Nickel slot. Maybe your frozen Lambert could be upgraded but honestly your squad is solid."
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,3,Wed Jun 24 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"For 4 mill you can probably get Ray Lewis for the MLB and then either a CB (Cromartie) or Easter Woodson for PP or get Ronnie Lott and slide Harrison Smith to the Nickel, and get Megatron. That should add to about 4 mill but the Ronnie Lott option is cheaper. However if you wait for the legends packs and sell the players you are subbing out then you can probably get the Center upgrade too but that isn't crucial.  Personally I would get rid of Russell and get any other 99qb, because I've found him to be a fumble machine. But, a lot of ppl like him and playing that style, so that is more of a personal choice.  You might consider a receiving TE for the flex and sliding OBJ to the WR2 spot, but that is a personal playing style choice. There are so many MM TEs out."
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Wed Jun 24 13:26:49 2015 UTC,Get Mike webster - i can't emphasize this enough - also ditch lambert for ray lewis and get largent or megatron over julio
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,apollonese,2,Wed Jun 24 12:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think your O-line is good enough, but Webster is the man.  FE Nick Mangold is a step up from Kelce as well"
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,2,Wed Jun 24 13:09:14 2015 UTC,Kelce just blow whoever is lined up across up on running plays.  I really don't have a problem with Kelce.   I'll try out Webster but I noticed an upgrade from the RTTP Center to Kelce right away.
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,cheesypie777,3,Wed Jun 24 15:06:01 2015 UTC,Bo Jackson. Dude is unfair
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,2,Wed Jun 24 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of holding out hope of getting Barry Sanders.  Like maybe someone dumps a dupe on August 14th for less than $5M.   But I think I'm going to target Bo, Ray Lewis, and upgrade to Pat Pete which seems like everyone hates.   I don't get the Pat Pete hate I've gotten more ints with Pat Pete than anyone else. Well Ed Reed is a close second."
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,vN_GreeD,2,Wed Jun 24 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"All about preference man.  I have PH PP, and I'm not really a fan, because he always seems to be the dude getting beat by the AI.  I've seen other people like yourself though that really dig him.  If he's good on your squad, just keep him."
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,BenjimanWa,2,Wed Jun 24 19:32:54 2015 UTC,Any advice on players alignment or players to target?  Megatron over Julio?  Dion Sanders over someone?  Obviously I want Barry Sanders but it doesn't look that will happen unless I open him in a pack.
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,BenjimanWa,2,Wed Jun 24 12:53:44 2015 UTC,Def meagtron over Julio
MaddenMobileForums,3ay38y,stlouisraiders,2,Wed Jun 24 16:21:32 2015 UTC,"Center honestly doesn't do anything. I used the 84 version of Kelce and saw no difference from using PH Kelce, Webster or mangold. But that said I think Megatron, FB v-jax over Julio. Faulk over Murray or miller. MM lambert or Ray Lewis instead of Drozen lambert. Deion sanders is one of the best corners in the game so I would suggest using him."
MaddenMobileForums,3axfe5,qloud-,2,Wed Jun 24 07:25:55 2015 UTC,Contact EA.
MaddenMobileForums,3axfe5,Ryan5427,2,Wed Jun 24 07:31:47 2015 UTC,What would be the best way to do so?
MaddenMobileForums,3axfe5,Ryan5427,2,Wed Jun 24 07:33:31 2015 UTC,I've never done it but I've heard that finding the option to talk to them on the phone is the way to go. I believe you can request a phone call from them from their website.

MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,NkNick,3,Tue Jun 23 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"I started playing about a week ago and have picked up both the 94 Big Ben and 92 Luck with 2 speed bonus for under 12k. In terms of sale value and value for my team which should I sell and which should I keep?? Also I've read about the upcoming reset and loss of players and coins, could anyone elaborate about what exactly will happen and when?? Thanks a Bunch In advance!"
MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 23 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the game will reset August 15, meaning you will lose all your coins and your team, but if you improve your team overall and finish seasons and complete sets, you will earn credits for the next game.  Basically this means you will not get to keep your team* but if you have a good team, you will get a headstart next season.  Keep Big Ben. He's pretty good I hear. Sell Luck. Nice snipe btw, 12k is pretty good. The +2 speed for Luck only applies to Colts players.    *there is this thing called legacy that no one understands, but basically you get to use your old team for special live events."
MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 23 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"Also, to get more coins, I'd start off by flipping gold and elite trophies. that is your best bet. I'd buy/snipe them for 2k and flip for 5k. Both trophies flip at these prices. you will make very low margins, but you can gain some cash quickly if you manage to do this in high volumes. snipe at night for the best deals. Another Tedious method: Guest Accounts.Basically, connect to Facebook if you havent already and the log out. create a fake facebook, then proceed to rush for 80 yards and pass for . 80 yards in h2h and season. this will earn you a free 20k plus a shit ton of trophies which you can use for Large quicksell set or just to sell on Auction House. then log out and log in with your actual account and post a crappy bronze player for the exact amount that is in the fake account. then logout and login with the fake account and but that exact player (set the AH search parameters to that exact player) and buy it. Then the money you have made will transfer and you can log back into your main and be at least 20k richer. Repeat until it bores you (which is really fast, this is tedious even if it only really takes 10-15 min)."
MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 23 23:22:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Any thought what I could get for Luck? None on the AH at the moment...
MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,UffaloIlls,2,Tue Jun 23 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Uh, I'd go BID price of 15k, BIN 18k.  Thats my gut feeling."
MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,ConfusedAlgerian,2,Tue Jun 23 23:29:31 2015 UTC,"Luck is only a 90, but he's being boosted by something.  Boosts are your friend, btw.

MaddenMobileForums,3avzr3,UffaloIlls,3,Tue Jun 23 23:54:01 2015 UTC,If you get that up to like 25k you can pick up a 96 ovr Julian Edelman.

MaddenMobileForums,3awbyg,awesom567,2,Wed Jun 24 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"Ditto, he stands out like a sore thumb on your team, you could do a lot for your team with those 2+ mill he should net you. If you really like him get the 98 card for about 400k or less and you would still have a lot of coins to improve other needs on your squad. However your first move should be to upgrade your 89 starting safety, then look at your other starting safety, third upgrade your starting HB. Really if you wanna make a large team impact, use the coins you can get for the Ray Lewis MM, and do it before Legends packs are released."
MaddenMobileForums,3awbyg,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Wed Jun 24 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"A 99 QB (just use personal preference between Brady, Rodgers, Vick, and Wilson), another S (FB Landry is a good option), and a better RB."
MaddenMobileForums,3awbyg,Tyronexplosion,2,Wed Jun 24 01:56:38 2015 UTC,FB Landry for the win!!!
MaddenMobileForums,3awbyg,westywall,2,Wed Jun 24 14:52:21 2015 UTC,Vick at QB and 99 Kam are highly recommended... those should be about 500k total

MaddenMobileForums,3awbyg,atkoch3,2,Wed Jun 24 01:16:40 2015 UTC,ok then you could get a WR im not sure who though... maybe someone with height or a stat boost

It would be too easy to just do the set and make 100 coins every time you complete the trade in.  The market adjusts it so that you cant simply spam the set 10000x just to make easy money. It's happened to most sets (MVP comes to mind) where the market adjusts to a point where the set is not profitable."

MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,ZtheT,3,Tue Jun 23 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"thanks. I'm wondering if the trucking glitch is a huge problem though. and Bo is about 1.8 mil and Faulk is 1.4mil, so I'm not sure if I should save a few hundred k to upgrade Oline or WR... Do you have advice for that?"
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,ZtheT,4,Tue Jun 23 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get Faulk for 1 mil. Bo, on the other hand, is hard to get for less than 1.8 mil. Maybe 1.6 mil if you are lucky. But his price has really gone up. If you can save for Bo though, he is the superior back. Trucking with him is about as fantastic as it gets. He just bowls defenders over."
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,ZtheT,3,Tue Jun 23 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"ok thanks for the advice!  I hope I can get a cheap Bo.  Honestly i might just get Faulk because he is more unique and has awesome card art, lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Tue Jun 23 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"He is not a bad back by any means. And his price often comes down a little during FB events. But seriously, do not pay more than a mil for him. In fact, if you find one with a lower bid, you can probably win the bidding war in the 900k range."
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BobbyBoucherSCLSU,3,Tue Jun 23 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Agree target Faulk FB buy by bid in range 900k-1M, anything over that stop. Faulk is great for outside runs, and throwing to, and he seems more elusive than Bo, because sometime he just gets out of a 3 defender jam and keeps going. I however prefer Bo, but have used Faulk extensively, I didn't like his speed at 96 (but he seemed faster) but I don't have any speed boosts either. You could check out the Legend Faulk 98, his stats are remarkably comparable to the 99, but at a 60% discount. http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/104725/107206/107246"
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,Ryan5427,2,Tue Jun 23 20:04:15 2015 UTC,thanks for pointing that out.  I saw them on the AH while I was investigating 99 faulk.  I guess I'd prolly buy that as a test to see if I  would like the 99

MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,xKizume,2,Tue Jun 23 19:08:37 2015 UTC,I rocked bo since he was going for 750k back before the coin glitch. No complaints. Only fumbled 3 or 4 times
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,theskyhooker,2,Tue Jun 23 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"I had Faulk and I didn't see the hype he had gotten, but he was better than Honors Murray. Don't know about Bo but his stats don't lie bro, so I'd say Bo. All just depends on your play style, speed back is Bo and more of a trucker is Faulk."
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,xKizume,2,Tue Jun 23 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"more of a trucker is Faulk.   Bo has +13 trucking on Faulk...  Did you mix these two up?  Faulk is speed, trucker is Bo."
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,Mother-Trucker12,2,Tue Jun 23 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"Well kind of, apparently a lot of people said that there is a bug with Bo's trucking where he loses all of his speed after he trucks, and that he tends to fumble while trucking as well. Also Faulk and Bo are tied with agility, but since Faulk has +1 agility boost, he boosts him self up 1 more and agility is somewhat (medium) factor in trucking.  Here is a bit from a review that Modzy did about Bo's trucking:  ""Yeah, you probably just skipped everything above and was like ""let's just see his trucking glitch"". No.... I'm not there yet. Okay I'm ready. I honestly don't know what is wrong with his trucking. Some claim it's because it is above 99 but no one knows for sure. If you are curious what the trucking glitch/bug is well basically bo Jackson would mostly slow down when he trucks due to his animation. He literally loses all that moment and gets gang tackled soon after. Basically to sum it up, he trucks, and he knocks over the guy, but then comes to an almost complete stop, where he has to startup again (sorry for runon sentences lol). Well this trucking glitch appears almost all the time and it basically slows him down.""  It's all personal preference in the end, but what I meant to say is that Faulk excels at agility (jukes and stiff arms) and trucking (only slightly better in game) while Bo is more of a speed back."
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BenjimanWa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:37 2015 UTC,agility (jukes and stiff arms)    Aren't stiff arms power?  I used FE Morris and he did strength trucks which were very often stiff arms.
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BenjimanWa,2,Wed Jun 24 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Agility (AGI) – How well the player cuts when running, responding to the Left Stick more quickly.  I dunno, I get a variety of things when I truck, juke and stiff arm and I see agility commonly but it could be power. I don't see the trucking stat much often, and a couple of times I get fail trucks I get bad angle, not enough speed and not enough weight. It's pretty much random for me so I'm not really sure, someone probably knows better o.o"
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BenjimanWa,2,Thu Jun 25 00:42:54 2015 UTC,I run FB Faulk with 98 Franco in the slot. It's a very effective combo if you pass to your RB and flex often. Never tried Bo but Faulk has the tendency to break 2-3 per run for me. He also seems a lot faster than his stats show
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BenjimanWa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:34:59 2015 UTC,Faulk is definitely the better back. Since you like outside running Faulk is the man. Bo is more for the up the middle ground and pound. Faulk is faster IMO and had the nice boost
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,BenjimanWa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:08:54 2015 UTC,I've heard Bo is an outside rusher as well
MaddenMobileForums,3auxmt,kwrocket,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:10:30 2015 UTC,I mean his stats reflect that. But through use and through many other opinions I believe him to be sub par in the outside running. Although many complain of fumbling I never really had that issue but I used Faulk from Rookie 1 all the way to 75 mill fans and he fumbled 1-2 times. All in all if I have the choice Faulk is my back

But my original point was saying that Spider-Man 2 is one of the worst movies ever made is blatant ignorance. If you are presenting these lists and rankings as fact, then you should also see Spider-Man 2 not far behind number one, 'everywhere'."

Keep in mind, you lose money with the AH fee when you transfer coins, and the risk with driving up the price is that you end up buying him, and when you resale him, you're now paying the AH fee twice. At 5 mil, for example, if you pay it twice, that's a million dollars to the AH fee."

MaddenMobileForums,3asg1d,hobbes03,4,Tue Jun 23 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"I've seen some helpful proposals on this forum and Muthead about how to work around the post-June 15 update & constant crash wen you see the dreaded Startup screen - none of which worked for me (Andyroid gave me Error 492) - I had opened some tickets and had them closed by EA help after being told 'we are aware of the problem and working on a fix' -   I finally used the phone call option and the rep at EA asked me, ""Well, have you played a head to head game to get rid of that problem?"" (!!!!) and I wanted to send her a copy of Catch-22 to understand her own company's shortcomings.  Another rep repeated the company line that the Design Team and the Studio Team are aware of the problem (and each blaming the other) and when a fix is ready, it will be released.   MAybe before August 15?  The one piece of promising news is that if you spent money on Madden Cash shortly before the crash, or bought things with Madden Cash around that time, you can go to www.help.ea.com and REQUEST a refund in terms of Madden Cash being applied to your account.  Who knows how that will work.  I'm reading the posts about all the fun things going on in MM and - although it's now day 6- it feels like a year since I've played."

MaddenMobileForums,3arve3,ConfusedAlgerian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:41:36 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with the clock on the bottom of the screen.

MaddenMobileForums,3arve3,Nomz0,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I guess that could be. Though from what I heard, it was only people on Apple that couldn't do it? One of my friends used an auto toucher for a different game on android, and after upgrading his operating system it wasn't compatible. Maybe there was just some apple update? Not really sure, though you might be on to something, since people were saying that you can no longer set your clock forward to unlock live events early"
MaddenMobileForums,3aru4d,Powehouse,3,Tue Jun 23 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"I'm leaving work, so I don't have a lot of time to help you. Here are some thoughts I have about your team:  CONSIDERING YOUR COIN SITUATION  The easiest upgrade to make will be FB Devin Hester (+1 AGI). This upgrade has less to with OVR and more to do with performance. FB Hester has 99 SPD, 97 AGI (98 with boost), 99 ACC, 95 AWR, 98 SPM, 99 JKM and 99 ELU. His 73 STR and 85 CAR are solid too. The only drawback is his 92 CAT (along with 57 TRU, 83 RTE, 87 SPC and 80 REL). Even with these drawbacks, FB Hester is a diamond in the rough. He is a value card that I highly recommend adding to your team. He's effective as an outside WR going deep or as a slot receiver. I usually use him on deep routes to beat DBs over the top. Then I throw a bomb to him. It's not 100% full proof, but I'd give it a sold 93% depending on the DBs. Here's a comparison of Hester to your current WRs:  http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/104718/9002/9003  http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/104718/3110  Hester's buy now prices aren't that great, but his bid prices are mostly decent. He's worth a go. If you don't want to upgrade at WR, then I recommend upgrading at TE. TOTY Greg Olsen is your man. I won't list his stats this time. I'll just provide a comparison to your current TE and another 96 TE: Honors Gronk.  http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/players/compare/9004/107081/13  Olsen is the best value TE in the game. His stats may not be flashy, but he brings down almost every pass that goes his direction. His hands are actually better than Honors Gronk's. Gronk may have the better CAT, but his hands are stone more times than not (this is my personal experience). Olsen is mostly better than Mackey too.  My last recommendation is draft player Arik Armstead (+1 STR). He's not the best stats-wise (and his prices normally aren't great), but he outperforms his OVR. He can be a starter for my 105 OVR defense at times, and his +1 STR is valuable. The best you can hope for with him is that you win with a bid. His buy now prices are disgusting.  LONG TERM OUTLOOK  Safety is a weak point on your team. Try your best to complete the Gauntlet set to get 99 Kam and 96 Maxwell. Maxwell would be your new #1 CB and all your other CBs would slide down one spot (knocking Josh Norman out of your line-up). Target the 96 OVR Earl Thomas III. His +2 STR will be very valuable to your team.  I also recommend targeting defensive backs like FB Charles Woodson, FB Ed Reed, and FB Adrian Wilson. Prices aren't great, but if you make more coins they're something to consider.  If you have any more questions, feel free to comment below. If you need advice for making coins, PM me as well."
MaddenMobileForums,3aru4d,Reereez95,3,Tue Jun 23 00:48:01 2015 UTC,Fb woodson is a monster. His prices are high but he plays better than alot of 99s and if you can get him for sub 400 id snatch him up
MaddenMobileForums,3arbe8,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,3,Mon Jun 22 21:46:34 2015 UTC,The gameplay right now. It's really slow until you get into open field and you can't control your recievers while the ball is in the air to gain advantage of your opponents.
MaddenMobileForums,3arbe8,Zockman175,2,Mon Jun 22 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"true. I've notice that since the update, on passing plays, the QB rolls out verrrrrrry slowly and the ball seems to hang in the air for a literal eternity, but you cant user the WR at all..."

MaddenMobileForums,3arbe8,TheNewJerry,2,Mon Jun 22 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"Agree here too. It's easier with a QB like MM Vick, but you should be able to scramble with a slower HB too. It's annoying watching guys like Cutler, Brees and Stafford effortlessly scramble in season mode. And not a single one will fumble the ball once they are hit!! (they don't slide, so you can rule that out as a reason they don't fumble) And they'll scramble for like 3 or 4 plays in a row, about 8 yards apiece."

MaddenMobileForums,3arbe8,TheNewJerry,2,Mon Jun 22 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"Most other people have listed my greatest pet-peeves already: AH bots, force-closing, no pass-interference called, timeouts, the difficulty to pull a decent card, the struggle to scramble with the QB, etc. Seeing as I have no way to put a different spin on their complaints (I merely commented on their posts with my own thoughts), I'm going to move in a different direction. Instead of gameplay aggravations, this is a personal irritation:  Madden Mobile lacks variety. Compared to the Madden 25 app? FAR more entertaining, FAR more expansive, FAR more card types, FAR more activities, FAR more energy and FAR faster ways to make coins. So I'm not trying to bash Madden Mobile and say it's a shitty game. It is a lot better than its predecessor. But there's one thing Madden 25 had that Madden Mobile doesn't hold a candle to: variety of legend players.  Obviously everyone has their own opinion of who should be a ""Legend"" player or a ""Mobile Master,"" but we can all agree on one thing: recycling the same player over and over and over and over and over and over and over and overandoverandoverandoverandover ... AND OVER AGAIN is INSANELY boring!   I can appreciate legends receiving upgraded cards if their initial cards sucked balls (i.e. Jack Ham, John Randle, MJG and Derrick Brooks), but when you make a 99 Mobile Masters card for a player who ALREADY has a 99 version? I'm looking at you Tom Brady!!! (and I'm a Pats fan) Think about it for a moment. James Harrison has 5 different versions of his card (6 if you count the rookie card for his MM set). He's become the defensive equivalent of Gronk, who has SIX different cards (7 if you count his signature card, 8 if you count the rookie card for his MM set). I remember when halfway through the NFL season Gronk had a wimpy 89 OVR card. I desperately wanted a good Gronk... I did not ask for a variety. There are two 96 OVR Gronks in the game... same stats, different classifications...  And the real problem isn't the over-abundance of other cards. Even though it dilutes the AH, I'm not THAT bothered by 8 Gronks and 6 Harrisons. The real issue is the lack of other choices.   I understand that EA is limited by whose player rights they have, but it's extremely disheartening when we can't have players like Jim Brown, Eric Dickerson, Jim Kelly, Thurmon Thomas, Dick Butkus, John Hannah, Walter Jones, Mike Haynes, Phil Simms, Howie Long, Fran Tarkenten, Lester Hayes, Charles Haley, Willie Brown, Jeremy Shockey, Ty Law (I would LOVE for this to happen), Chuck Bednarik, Bart Starr, Dick LeBeau, Pat Tillman, Tony Gonzalez, Ladainian Tomlinson and Randy FREAKING Moss.  There isn't even a Champ Bailey card (on Mobile) to recognize his retirement this past season. No respect.  Madden 25 had a wider variety of legends at their disposal, and I don't know why that is. Did player rights run out after Madden 25 and EA was too lazy to get them? Did players refuse when player rights contracts ran out? I honestly don't get it. Life isn't perfect, and we won't get all the players we want, but there's little to no variety among the legends EA provides in Madden Mobile. Instead, we're treated to Plaxico Burress getting a Mobile Masters cards. Oh, and I heard Gronk is getting a new card too. It's to celebrate the fact that he already has 8 other fucking cards to choose from.  Sorry for the swearing and sorry for the ranting. When I get on a role... I can't stop. Madden Mobile is a fun game, and I don't completely hate it. No matter all the shit EA puts us through, we keep coming back for more. Am I right? I have a terrible analogy for this that I will refrain from using.  My only wish for Madden 16: wider variety of legends. Please..."

MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,ArianaGranDeez,3,Mon Jun 22 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on how many coins you have.   Bo Jackson & DeMarco Murray are the best trucking HBs in the game. Next in line is MM Lynch. I put Murray over Bo (IMO) for trucking in the game. Even though Bo has superior STR and strength TRU, Murray has the far superior AGI and agility TRU. His strength TRU isn't too bad either. So he's my favorite for trucking.  Next in line would be MM Adrian Peterson. Decent enough at trucking that he's #4 on my list.  5th in line would be SB Legend Franco Harris. I used him as my flex HB for the longest time, and it worked out perfectly.   NOTE: The above list of HBs is my own personal view point. I have no idea whether SB Franco Harris actually has a better TRU than 98 Lynch. This is just a reflection of my experience with these player.  If we're talking about the Flex HB position in particular, then not all the aforementioned HBs work. In the Flex HB spot, it's nice to have someone who can not only block for your running back, but can also catch passes out of the backfield. Faster HBs with pass-catching ability are effective too (I use FB Reggie Bush as my HB flex sometimes), but the former is preferable.  The obvious fit here is Bo Jackson. Best all-around HB in the game. The only thing he's seriously lacking is elusiveness. Otherwise, he's strong with incredible pass-catching ability for a HB. 100 TRU speaks for itself. The only thing he lacks is solid blocking ability. But his 65 IMB redeems his low RBK rating.  The next best player (and a personal Madden favorite of mine) is SB Legend Franco Harris. Harris has 92 STR, 86 CAT, 99 TRU and 98 STF. The only serious drawback he has is 92 SPD and 93 ACC. But a serious plus? His 80 RBK and 78 IMB. This is why I love using Franco in the flex: he can block, catch passes, and bully his way through the line for some yards.   If you're looking for a pure blocker at the flex, the obvious pick would be PH Bruce Miller. Otherwise, my favorite guys are Bo and Franco. Franco is the most affordable pick."
MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,Reereez95,2,Mon Jun 22 22:19:09 2015 UTC,Yeah so probably going to pick up Franco since I'm not looking into putting down lots of coin for another HB.
MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,Reereez95,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"Good choice. He isn't the flashiest stat-wise, but he was really effective. From personal experience, he's a good choice. Fun to use on pass plays too."

MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jun 22 21:29:40 2015 UTC,PH Bell is IMO a pretty well rounded back that has done everything I needed. Just don't ask Bell to truck. He always Strength trucks even though his Agility is much higher.

MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,TimHepp,2,Mon Jun 22 22:22:44 2015 UTC,oooh. Why not put 94 charles as main and murray as flex?  I loved charles while I had him.

MaddenMobileForums,3ar6sd,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Mon Jun 22 22:34:40 2015 UTC,ah.  Then Murray at RB1 and Franco in FB is the way to go. Franco is fast enough to keep up with Murray.  What I really recommend is Faulk or Bo Jackson main and Franco Flex.

MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,FIFAforlife735,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:53:33 2015 UTC,This I had an all draft team when they came out. Made the team for cheap and was at 99 OVR
MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,ghd1353,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"True, someone built a 100 overall team in less than 30min with draft players for only 500k..."
MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,UffaloIlls,3,Mon Jun 22 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"The challenge you face with rebuilding a decent, cheaper team is the sudden spike in all player prices. The same thing happened at the end of Madden 25: people knew the game was ending, so they raised the prices. I imagine their thoughts were along the lines of: ""The game is ending? Then fuck it! I'm going to raise the prices of my cards, and all these other dickheads will have to deal with it!"" Add in the benefit of purchasing better cards to improve your season score, and you have a shit storm brewing as Madden Mobile approaches a reset. Nonetheless, there are players that are affordable even in this dark time. I will give you some options at each position (varying between players with boosts and players with better OVR) to provide variety. Here we go:  GENERAL ADVICE  My first advice is to stay away from Game Changers with a subtraction that negatively impacts your team. For example, as tempting as it is to put GC Nate Washington in your line-up at WR (for his +1 SPD), it would not be beneficial to your defense (-1 TKL). To a lesser extent, GC Alshon Jeffery (+1 SPD, -1 STR) might be more beneficial than Washington, but his -1 STR will mean your receivers will have a harder time holding onto the ball (and catching contested passes). I've found that STR directly correlates to whether your receiver will hold onto the ball when he gets slammed immediately after catching a pass. So avoid players whose -1 will cripple your team.  Don't add players with unnecessary boosts to your line-up. For example, I find the addition of draft player Malcom Brown to be completely unnecessary for your team. Unless you construct a defense full of terrible tacklers, I don't think +1 TKL is a valuable stat boost. Look to boost core stats that affect every player on the team at once. Position specific boosts (i.e. PBK or TKL) or team specific boosts are limiting and unnecessary (unless a really good player has a limiting stat boost - then it's easy to cope with).   The core stats you want to boost are AWR, SPD, STR, AGI and ACC. AWR and SPD are the most important. There's no particular order for the other 3 stats. AGI is an underrated stat category. I find it leads to greater effort and more fantastic (and unrealistic) catches by my receiving core. It also helps on defense, as your players are able to make plays more often (theoretically). ACC is very important for any player. This determines how long it takes a player to build to max speed. A player can have 150 SPD, but it won't matter if his acceleration is 30. My only problem with boosting ACC is that more and more players now have 100 ACC in this game. Boosting a 100 stat hurts that stat, and I don't like to do that (more on that in a second). I like all my players at full strength. STR is seriously underrated. I have an entire defensive boosting line-up that gives my prime offense almost +10 STR. So when Dez Bryant jumps for a pass (with his 93 STR), I know he's coming down with the ball (provided a defensive back doesn't jump in front of him). STR is also helpful for forcing fumbles on defense. I can give Jason Pierre-Paul almost 99 STR, which is INSANE to think about since he's a finesse DE.   Avoid players with tantalizing stats but terrible AWR. This applies to almost every draft player. There are exceptions, but it does not help your team to have a secondary made up of Kevin Johnson, Byron Jones and Marcus Peters. Even though they all have +1 AWR each to go with Sherman's +5 AWR, nothing can offset their horrible PLR. Play recognition has more bearing on a defense's play than AWR, but both are equally valuable. You'd rather have both be good than one or the other. So having one draft player in the secondary wouldn't be bad, but having an entire secondary of players like that would not bode well.  My last piece of advice pertains to the art of boosting: IF you decide to have boosting line-ups, target players that boost for specific players. For example, I have Jamie Collins starting on my defense. Normally my starting RG is Combine Greg Robinson. When I'm on defense, I swap out Robinson for Captain Logan Mankins. Mankins provides +2 STR to all New England players. I previously mentioned avoiding players with limiting boosts, but this is an exception. There are no OGs that provide boosts to an entire roster, nor do they provide boosts to a valuable stat. Since I have a defensive player from New England on my team, Mankins' +2 STR is valuable (the stat boost layers). The only other OG like this is RTTP Team MVP Jon Asamoah, and I used him when I had Sanders on my defense (although for Sanders, +2 STR is negligible for his performance).   END NOTES  I will post some advice about what players to specifically target later on. I need to do some research on the pricing of different players, that way I can provide you with somewhat accurate estimates.   I do have a couple questions for you /u/Jsweezy23:  (1) Which do you value more: boosts or OVR?  (2) Which positions do you value more when you play?  (3) Have you achieved 100% season score? (I assume you have)  (4) The card types you listed (draft, flashbacks and captains), are these just preferences, or are you open to 99 OVR players too? Do you have a limit as to how many 99 OVR players you're looking to get?  (5) How do you feel about boosting? By boosting I mean the notion that you have a boosting line-up for offense and defense. When on defense, your boosting offense would be in (to boost attributes of your defense). If you're open to boosting, I can give you line-up advice for that. But if you'd prefer that I just give advice on an overall line-up (mixed with 99s, flashbacks, gamechangers, draft players, etc.), then I will do just that."
MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,Reereez95,2,Mon Jun 22 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I knew you'd come along eventually. You definitely out did me. Well done...  slow clap"
MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,UffaloIlls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks /u/UffaloIlls. I wouldn't say I outdid you. I didn't give any specific advice on what players to go for. I might add that later, but I don't know. I'm always up for giving advice, but I lost a lot of confidence in that ability when EA said ""fuck you"" to boosting. With season score (and the game winding down), I don't know how to give people appropriate advice. I want to do what I always do, but now that things are tailored to OVR, players with boosts are less valuable. And I don't know how the OVR formulas work; I draw heavily from DeadToWrites' excel sheet when it comes to recommendations on OVR, but those only tell me for higher OVR players. I think I'll get my confidence back when the new season starts, but for now (with the reset looming) I'm in a state of flux."

MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,UffaloIlls,2,Mon Jun 22 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"Introduction  Ok, I'd start off by buying a bunch of draft players for Oline, LB and WR. They boost and are cheap.   TOTY players (Vollomer, Peters, Boling, Frederick, all of whom are 94+ and less than 60k each i believe), and Greg Robinson (you already have him...) will be other cheap Oline additions.    Von Miller and Shazier will be good LBs also on the cheap.  In general combine players (Poe, Milliner, clowney, Mcfadden are also good, and cheap) and Draft players are good fits for a rebuild.   For 600k, you can make a 100 Overall team in literally half an hour.  Will its gameplay be good?  Not so much.  The low Speed and AWR of Draft players makes them not so fun to play with... You'll need a few MMs to make it fun.   Offense  Cedric Ogbuehi is great to add at OT. He's got 98 runblock and +1 PBK. AJ Cann is great at OG. also has high RBK and adds +1 RBK  I'd recommend getting MM Gronk.  for 1.5mil, he's definitely worth it.  There are no really good draft TEs and Vernon Davis sucks (combine card)  so, Splurge here. If that sounds too expensive, Honors Gronk or TOTY olsen are also great. PH Jimmy Graham is awesome, but at 300k he might be too premium as well.   At WR, get yourself PH Dez.  He is well worth making. for 400k you can buy him on AH, but for 180k you can make him yourself.  He is worth premium.  That leaves slot WR, where Draft parker is great.  99 catch and +1 speed is great value here. He's very cheap (30k).  There should be no question that Sproles is the guy to get for HB.  Maybe even get Reggie Bush at Flex.  Bush adds +1 speed.  Vontae Leach is another nice alternative.  He adds +1 Trucking, a stat that Sproles frankly is deficient on.  Oh, also, Captain cards can be helpful for boosting other cards of the same team. For example, I had 90 overall Tyron Smith for the longest time, just so I could boost Travis Frederick to 99 RBK.  Defense  At DT, I'd go for MM MJG. He is a runstuffing BEAST, and he's relatively cheap. If 400k is too much for one player, then get yourself combine poe or even captain poe. captain poe is only about 20k, but he was on my team forever. Dany Shelton, the draft player has decent stats and could be put at the 4-3 DT slot.  Kevin Williams also could be good at Dline, and he is cheap and adds +1 str.  And for DE, you could go for Jared Allen who offers +1 speed.  By the end of this, you might have the fastest team ever, lol.  Sproles will be fast af.  For your secondary, get draft Darby at CB. He's a bit more expensive than other cheap Draft corners (60k), but he has 99 man cover and is an INT machine. Also, champ bailey FB (cheap @ 30k) is awesome for boosting catch. He was on my 100 overall team till just last night. He has great speed, and 97 man cover.  Very solid, and he has AWR that is far superior to Draft players.  I was sad to see him go. Draft P.J. Williams would be nice to add +1 acc. Acceleration is important.  In order for your players to go anywhere with their speed, they need to accelerate to top speed before they run out of field.  Basic physics. That said, FB Sproles already has 99 acc.  If you just raise his speed, you're set. Also for SS, get yourself 99 Kam. +1 speed is helpful for OVR.  Also Kam only costs ~200k. PH Harrison smith for FS is worth the splurge at 170k if you make him yourself. 98 man cover is pretty epic.  Recommended lineup (with mostly cheaper options): http://www.muthead.com/madden-mobile/15/lineups/10457-lineup-advice-cheap-total-cost-est-1mil-total (cred to /u/atkoch3 for the idea)  TL;DR (closing notes):   Ultimately, I'd have to say AWR is relatively unimportant in the scheme of things.  It matters for overall and such, but frankly it's overrated.  Draft players are awesome and you can look past their deficiencies at AWR for the most part.  Speed is their main problem, but I got you covered there ( I believe your team in this situation is boosted a possible +4 speed and +2 ACC, which is a shit ton). For example, I see no impact of Darby's 80 AWR on gameplay, because he makes up for it by trailing the WR so closely with that 99 Man coverage.    There are a few positions that you should ditch draft players for.  I've listed a few MMs that I hold in very high regard and are very affordable.  PHs are a great way to get a top tier player like Dez for cheap.  And the few extra thousands that you spend on him are well worth it...  Edit: sorry for all the edits. I started remembering things to add and just wanted to make sure that they stood out."

However, draft Devon smith is an animal (99 catch, 99 agility) the flashback players have played absolutely crazy for me when I had them, and the captains are just meh. I say all flashback. You could do an all draft defense and all flashback offense, I've never seen that before"
MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,Reereez95,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"I completely 100% agree with this. It's for this reason that I primarily use draft players for boosting.

MaddenMobileForums,3apylz,SackRVC17,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"draft players for o line r a must at tackle get jake fisher and tj clemmings they boost strength, at guard there aren't any strength boosters, only pbk or rbk so as long as u geta draft player it doesn't really matter, i have scherff and aj cann, there r no boosters at center so u could blow a significant amount of money on a 99 if u want if not toty frederick or mvp lichtensteiger r good.  at hb i find fb sproles to be exceptionally good for game play and boosts strength, fb bush is only a 90 but boosts speed which is one of the most important attributes in the game, if u wanna spend a good amount here u could get 99 fb faulk who boosts agility and is a great speed and receiving back.  draft players r also good here as they're ovr is 94 they're awr is poor and speed is avg  but str agi and acc r good.  tevin coleman and todd gurley have the best boosts bc there's r speed, weldon is ok he boosts acc and i would not suggests melvin gordon bc he boosts trucking which is an irrelevant stat.  deviant parker is very good imo he boosts speed has good height and great catch. he is a good slot receiver and above average deep threat.  the best boosting deep ball receiver is fb vjax 96 and boosts strength he is 6'5'' and is very strong he will go up and get most balls. fo chris matthews doesn't boost but is also a great deep ball receiver most draft receivers have great jump, catch, agi, and acc but the rest boost jump or catch which aren't as important as speed. the only boosters at te r gc jimmy graham and draft maxx williams williams is alright he boosts catch and has good acc and agi and is an avg blocker graham boosts catch 2 but decreases speed by 1 so i would not recommend him.  u could use a non booster at te.  imo cw vernon davis is a great receiver and very fast for te's a budget beast is totw nate solder te he is huge and gets most jump balls and is obviusly a great blocker.  u could drop more money here by getting a 99 if u want but good te's could be had for less like toty olsen."

But if u have 2 Draft OTs and 2 Draft OGs and MvP lichenstieger they will be a a 99 or 98. With receivers... Hester u already have. But u could get FB Vincent Jackson, Draft White,  or the draft WR that's boosts speed. At TE I would put Maxx Williams who boosts catch. At RB I would have Sproles, bush, or Faulk. I have used all 3 and Faulk plays best but Bush and Sproles boost the best. QB I would have FB Palmer or Draft Winston with Winstom being the much better of the two. Moving to defense. I would have 2 Draft CBs that boost Awr or FB Asante possibly FB woodson for Ovr. Safeties I would have ET3 and Gauntlet Kam. LBs I would run 2 Draft LBs with Awr or strength boosts. MLb I would run Stephen Tulloch and a Draft guy that boosts strength or Awr. DEs I would have Shane ray and randy Gregory. DTs I would have FB Kevin Williams and armstead. That should complete the team. Based on my experience I didn't have Dom sherm  but my team was at 100 Off 100 def 95 special rounding to a 100 Ovr. With Dom sherm I think u could get to 101"

MaddenMobileForums,3alzct,LecMalenza,2,Sun Jun 21 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"cool concept. i would be into that.   but EA isn't creative enough and they don't care enough to implement that, in my opinion"
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,kavuong,2,Sun Jun 21 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"Could you post your team, or the corners you have now?"
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,ram1113,2,Sun Jun 21 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"I have ntl at cb1, vontae at cb2, Dom sherm at nickel and kam at dime.   Selling ntl will lead to vontae being at cb1, and sherm at cb2. Keeping kam at dime cuz of his crappy coverage stats."
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,vN_GreeD,2,Sun Jun 21 18:04:52 2015 UTC,TOTY Haden or Harris jr
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,awesom567,2,Sun Jun 21 17:43:35 2015 UTC,Which one is better in your opinion?
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,vN_GreeD,2,Sun Jun 21 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"or byron jones, he also gives +1 awarness"
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,theskyhooker,2,Sun Jun 21 18:14:25 2015 UTC,I'd take Harris Jr.
MaddenMobileForums,3amdcx,afxdub,2,Sun Jun 21 19:32:12 2015 UTC,FB Champ Bailey is a stud.
MaddenMobileForums,3am2ef,Thatlittlekitty,4,Sun Jun 21 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"if you wanted to save some money, you can replace Edelman with 94 devante parker. +1spd, 99 acc/cat/jmp, high other stats, and slow (which many consider an advantage). The extra speed brings my Murray up to 99 spd which I love!"
MaddenMobileForums,3am2ef,rollingintheturf,2,Sun Jun 21 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"If you get him, replace edelman for sure"
MaddenMobileForums,3am2ef,ConfusedAlgerian,2,Sun Jun 21 15:40:39 2015 UTC,You can save up for Bennett (around 300k) or Gates (around 400k). I personally think that Graham is that great. I would replace Edelman with Bennet/Gates cuz Gronk is a better blocker than both of them.
MaddenMobileForums,3am2ef,theskyhooker,2,Sun Jun 21 16:05:12 2015 UTC,I personally think that Graham is that great.   Do you mean not that great?
MaddenMobileForums,3am2ef,rcarr17,2,Sun Jun 21 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"woops... yeah, lol"
MaddenMobileForums,3al6vy,the_midgetaur,3,Sun Jun 21 07:43:19 2015 UTC,A 92 safety is between 15 and 20k

MaddenMobileForums,3alv6u,Gilligan_Played_Dumb,2,Sun Jun 21 15:07:13 2015 UTC,Was he injured?
MaddenMobileForums,3alv6u,Jason10005,2,Sun Jun 21 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He said the team he's ""going to"" so either a trade or a FA signing"
MaddenMobileForums,3alv6u,durkadurkdurka,2,Sun Jun 21 15:17:05 2015 UTC,That is waaayyyy over my head.
MaddenMobileForums,3alv6u,durkadurkdurka,2,Sun Jun 21 15:09:04 2015 UTC,Do we have to put -the- card up or any card at the mystery price? I think i know
MaddenMobileForums,3alv6u,TimHepp,2,Sun Jun 21 15:16:35 2015 UTC,The card
MaddenMobileForums,3akpiy,juicymercat,2,Sun Jun 21 03:44:37 2015 UTC,No one knows the answer to this but my guess is there is a generator randomly putting cards in packs I have seen people on here get the same card in two packs in a row and even the same card twice in one pack different positions
MaddenMobileForums,3akpiy,gkalldamday,2,Sun Jun 21 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"FYI, the contents of a given pack are all determined simultaneously.  You can tell because if you flip over one card, and another un-flipped card is an upgrade for your team, the Update Team button appears."
MaddenMobileForums,3akpiy,7heprofessor,2,Sun Jun 21 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"Does the update team card appear after the initial first card (not a card in the pack but the card that lets you into the pack) or before? If it is before then we know that sets are pre-determined. If not, it could follow any rule for all we know."
MaddenMobileForums,3akpiy,7heprofessor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:58:25 2015 UTC,The Update Team button appears as soon as any card is flipped over.  Not necessarily the one that will update your team.
MaddenMobileForums,3ak37i,ram1113,3,Sat Jun 20 23:46:30 2015 UTC,Check my other post for some slightly better pulls.
MaddenMobileForums,3ak37i,Itstheeyeofthetiger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"better pulls   Damn. Better pulls than that? I mean, the MU will go for >100k alone."
MaddenMobileForums,3akrps,hobbes03,4,Sun Jun 21 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"It should be Aaron Rodgers, or Matt stafford throwing at the programming team, because both can throw a little bit further/harder than Tom."

MaddenMobileForums,3akrps,theskyhooker,2,Sun Jun 21 16:52:38 2015 UTC,Just tried logging into my ios account and had this happening.

MaddenMobileForums,3ak6qo,RNotess,3,Sun Jun 21 00:23:26 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I guess a few extra bucks never hurts.  Is that what you plan to do with your excess wealth?  Or are giveaways your prime objective?

MaddenMobileForums,3ak6qo,UffaloIlls,2,Sun Jun 21 14:38:02 2015 UTC,you had 10 mil? thats pretty rich. The most ive had is 6mil

MaddenMobileForums,3ak6qo,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Sun Jun 21 15:01:26 2015 UTC,I have about 10 mill so I am mKing as many fake accounts on fb as I can and making more accounts on mm and trying to feed them coins to get them to 100 before the reset.   Right now I have 6. 2 at 100 and working on the others
MaddenMobileForums,3ak6qo,TheRealFluffy0ne,2,Sun Jun 21 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea at all.  Too much work for me though, so kudos to you man!"

Have my eye on MM Barry once the price drops a bit.  Till the reset I'll probably just hoard coins until they stop releasing MM players so I can make sure I can get all the players I want for my Legacy team. After that maybe I'll blow it all on pro packs or do a give away or something."
MaddenMobileForums,3ak6qo,Shocho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:16:34 2015 UTC,Do you really feel that Legacy mode is going to be a major portion of your gameplay?
MaddenMobileForums,3akj4l,KratosIV,2,Sun Jun 21 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"For the Guards you will make out well. For the tackles it depends how much you paid. At 65, you will make a small profit, but still a profit. The Guards should fetch you 125k when market bounces back. The tackles will fetch you about 80k."
MaddenMobileForums,3akj4l,ZtheT,2,Sun Jun 21 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Would the profit margin  increase  if I  used the collectables to get Ricky Wagner and sell him?
MaddenMobileForums,3akj4l,ZtheT,2,Sun Jun 21 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"I am not 100% sure what he sells for, but it depends with PH Players. I know Julio Jones is hard to push for 300k, yet the WR PH Cards sell easy for 55k a piece."
MaddenMobileForums,3akj4l,TimHepp,2,Sun Jun 21 02:54:36 2015 UTC,Currently  the lowest he goes for is 575000.

MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,UnknownWalnut,3,Sun Jun 21 01:10:47 2015 UTC,I've seen them selling for over 400k with Gridiron out. I think it goes back to 600k in about a week to week and a half. Sooner than that it will hit 550k.
MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,ZtheT,2,Sun Jun 21 01:20:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for the answer! I've been attempting to snipe them at 400k and less, but I can only seem to get them at ~400k. So now I know I can at least make some profit."
MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,ZtheT,3,Sun Jun 21 01:23:47 2015 UTC,"Don't buy any more at that price. The investment versus profit margin is not worth it. I've sniped almost 100 TOTY Gronk, Grimes, and Manning cards for 20k and under. I will more than double my investment. 400k for max 150k profit is not even one and half times your money and it's dumping a lot into one card."
MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,ZtheT,2,Sun Jun 21 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"True. Very true. I think I might stop going after those collectibles and maybe try the TOTY collectibles, maybe something else."
MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,StanleyTheBugman,2,Sun Jun 21 01:39:41 2015 UTC,Well.... This happened...  http://imgur.com/1zMuqzF Got 18 of them in one refresh. Did I just make a huge mistake or did I get really lucky? Dumped 360k into them.
MaddenMobileForums,3akbg3,ZtheT,2,Sun Jun 21 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"That is very good. You'll more than double your money. I sell them for 50k. They are not quick sells, but they sell. You might have to repost a few times, but you will sell them all. Stand pat on your price, unless you are desperate for the money back. In that case, you can probably sell them quicker at 45k."

MaddenMobileForums,3akgxt,NJSeahawks,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"someone divulged this info to me and it has been invaluable: (credit to u/tmpkiwi)   Every 5 minutes the snipes ""drop."" Basically what that means is that every card that was put up for auctions in the last five minutes appears at once. The goal of sniping is to buy players at a lower price than what you can sell them for. Filter the auction house so that players will only appear at a lower value then they are worth, and keep refreshing. When the snipes drop try to buy the players as quick as you can. Most of the time you will not get it but occasionally you will get one and make a good profit. Snipes usually drop when the last digit of the clock is 5 and 0 or 6 and 1, so I recommend not sitting there for 5 minutes waiting. Begin refreshing and waiting for the snipes on the 4s and 9s"

MaddenMobileForums,3ahugg,Robotsaur,2,Sat Jun 20 19:13:02 2015 UTC,Dumervil is terrible. Get rid of him and replace with FO LaVonte or Honors Davis. Upgrade Daryl Smith and Sean Smith to whoever is better than them. DeMarcus Ware and Calais Campbell aren't very good. Replace one of them with PH Jason Pierre Paul who can be made pretty cheaply if you snipe.
MaddenMobileForums,3ahugg,Tyronexplosion,2,Sat Jun 20 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"Thomas Davis (250k), 96 Maxwell (85k), any 96 DE (FB Peppers or Williams, CW Clowney), a 98 MLB (Keuchly or Shazier).    Some things to go for."

MaddenMobileForums,3agesc,UffaloIlls,2,Fri Jun 19 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"Steve Atwater:       Stephen Dennis Atwater (born October 28, 1966) nicknamed ""Smiling Assassin"" is a former American football player who spent most of his career playing free safety for the Denver Broncos. Atwater and Dennis Smith made up a Broncos secondary that was known for their ferocious hits on opposing players. He was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and two-time Super Bowl champion. Atwater is considered to be one of the hardest hitting safeties in NFL history. Atwater's hit on Kansas City Chiefs running back Christian Okoye is often compared to the Oakland Raiders Jack Tatum's legendary hit on Houston Oilers running back Earl Campbell. Both hits are considered to be the two best hits on a running back by a safety in NFL history.

MaddenMobileForums,3agesc,turkmileymileyturk,2,Fri Jun 19 23:18:28 2015 UTC,Is he listed as an FS? thats just wrong...  Edit: Apparently he played both FS and SS in his career.  His stats make him look like more of a SS to me...
MaddenMobileForums,3agesc,Hiel0s,2,Fri Jun 19 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he's more like a SS too. But I guess this is kind of like the Easter Rod Woodson card. Woodson was primarily a CB in his career, but he played safety for BAL towards the end of his career. Similarly, EA must have decided to release a FS version of Atwater."
MaddenMobileForums,3agesc,DeadToWrites,2,Fri Jun 19 23:50:40 2015 UTC,Same with the ROLB card for Peppers.

MaddenMobileForums,3af4ot,Reereez95,2,Fri Jun 19 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Same. As soon as MM NTL is released, (assuming I can't get the MM version) I am going to buy the Legend version at a (hopefully) reduced cost. Then my secondary will be complete!  Oh, and don't forget MM Reed and Easter Rod Woodson at the safety positions! Reed grades out better at the SS position than any SS in the game (and he's a FS), so I would place Reed there. Woodson's 97 man and 95 press will help him as a FS when he needs to cover the slot on blitzes (i.e. Free Fire)."
MaddenMobileForums,3af4ot,alex-rw,2,Fri Jun 19 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"So, the best part of MMobile is the offseason... Next season i'm going to make coins to be ready for this, haha."

MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,jaguarfan715,2,Sat Jun 20 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"Hey man, props to you.  I've been sticking with my Redskins through their yearly shittiness for the past 20 years (2012 aside).  Hopefully you guys will get a 99 pretty soon."
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,jaguarfan715,2,Sat Jun 20 02:34:29 2015 UTC,Looking forward to TJ Yeldon possibly being that guy
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,xKizume,3,Sun Jun 21 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"The Jags don't have anything going for them, I feel so bad for em. They would be my guess as the worst team next year imo."
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,Reereez95,7,Fri Jun 19 18:21:51 2015 UTC,That could always be the Tennessee Titans too.
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,xKizume,2,Fri Jun 19 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are my runner up, the Raiders and Jets look to be much better next year however."
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,Reereez95,3,Fri Jun 19 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much the Jets will actually improve, but that defense will certainly be stout. I agree OAK will take some strides too. I think Tampa Bay will still struggle, but their offense will be improved enough that they win more games than TEN and JAC.   I actually have faith in TEN and JAC, but there are enough question marks that I'll have to see before I believe."
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,ZtheT,3,Fri Jun 19 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"MJD, Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith, a few o linemen or defense players maybe. Not many qualify."
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,codepoet2,3,Fri Jun 19 18:25:03 2015 UTC,I could see a solid Mark Brunell flashback card too ('96)... he was one of the top QBs that season.  Maybe not a 99... but close.
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,alexrider2398,2,Fri Jun 19 21:13:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised to see 99 OVR MJD as the final combine warrior.
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,UffaloIlls,2,Fri Jun 19 18:31:36 2015 UTC,There is already a good one on console that came out when he retired
MaddenMobileForums,3afflm,GiveMeSomeIhedigbo,2,Fri Jun 19 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"Dang, that's too bad.  I wish we got those console retirement cards.  Look at this monster!"

I even sniped multiple gold WRs at once per refresh.  Then again, the market has changed since I've been gone. A brave new world out there."

MaddenMobileForums,3afe5z,ZtheT,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:18:56 2015 UTC,I thought they were 2 separate but I've had a long week of work haha. I must've gotten the first one right away because when I started doing it the second time I had full stamina and there was less than 30 minutes left.
MaddenMobileForums,3afe5z,ZtheT,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they last 2-3 hours. Easy to confuse."
