AskAnthropology,3e455e,drofdarb72,6,Wed Jul 22 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"To begin with, ""viking"" is not the name of an ethnicity in any sense, rather than ""pirate"" or ""highwayman"". But I guess you're asking about late iron age nordic people. I just wanted to clear this out, maybe someone with expert knowledge on this will give you a good answer.  To a large extent they subsisted on sheep and cattle farming, and agriculture where the land allowed. This means that they barely developed ""urban cities"", although some clusters of a few houses may be found somewhere. Nothing like ""how to tame your dragon""."

But as always_wear_pyjamas said these societies where very agricultural with few large settlements.
AskAnthropology,3e455e,philiplstrom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"Well, they didn't really have cities as we would understand them, so the whole idea is pretty much a contradiction in terms.

Is there an area in the 4 fields you are more interested in? While I'm more Sociocultural, Linguistic Anthropology could be of interest. Kinship studies could be something providing some areas as well. I think you might like just about anything Structural. Claude Lévi-Strauss' Structural Anthropology might be fun. Though it can also be tough. I'm trying to remember an anthropologist who was pretty decent at ""interpreting"" LCS, but it's kinda lost on me. Leach? Also, if you enjoy chaos theory, I've had this book in my Amazon Wish List for a while.  One thing I would look at a bit differently (and this may be me personally) is that application of mathematical sciences or others (Such as Chaos) within at least Cultural Anthropology be is normally viewed as a theory or model of interpretation or understanding. Other models or theories could just as well apply, so it sits a bit differently than a mathematical problem might. Always, the combination of other fields and anthropology can always be a great thing and I hope that those few links gave you some extra reading!"
AskAnthropology,3e2ocd,DevilDonnie,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"I made this comment last year that may be somewhat helpful.  This applies specifically to hunter-gatherers though.   The late Louis Binford's extremely dense book Constructing Frames of Reference deals specifically with this idea. In a nutshell, he compiles weather station data, biomass calculations, and other environmental markers from around the world and relates those to ethnographic data on hunter-gatherers that live in those regions. He then attempts to calculate the kind of diet and population densities that hunter-gatherers would have been likely to maintain in those areas. The idea is that an archaeologist could then reconstruct ancient hunter-gatherer lifeways based on environmental data pulled from geologic sampling. It's a noble effort, but the math Binford uses is fuzzy to say the least. And the reality is that there is actually a lot of variation between hunter-gatherer groups in similar environments around the world, even when you're looking at something as basic as subsistence and group size."

Bill Skinner found the same thing in his entire lifework (which was something he called regional analysis and he included topography/geological features in his work).  To some extent similarity of landscape form may help trump weather differences.   Then there's work from biological anthropologists (extensive) that make the same point.  Larger noses are supposed to help warm arctic air.  Yet. northern Asia has some flat, small noses as does Arctic and SubArctic North America.

AskAnthropology,3dwduc,driverbickle,102,Mon Jul 20 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"Most likely because they simply didn't need to. There was plenty to eat, plenty of territory, and no particular population pressure forcing people to do something like invent agriculture. Civilization ain't all it's cracked up to be, if you have everything you need from the surrounding landscape.   Also, to clarify, it's almost certain that humans have had language for far longer than 10,000 years. Most linguists agree that language has existed at least as long as Homo sapiens, and at this point there's even a level of consensus that Neanderthals and other Homo species may have had it as well.   Did you maybe mean written language? Because writing is something that, like agriculture, cities, class stratification, etc. has really only existed as long as we've needed it. If your culture is simple enough that you don't need to keep written records, you stick with your nice oral tradition. (We have ample evidence that the first writing was for record keeping, bureaucracy, accounting, and the like.)  Towns, too, are one of those sort of slippery concepts. Most likely, some humans in some times and places had sedentary settlements because the landscape enabled them to stay in the same place most of the time in a sustainable manner. You can sustain a village on a nice cliff to drive antelope off of if you have a rudimentary sense of animal husbandry.  But cities are a bigger and more complicated thing, and you need agriculture for cities.   In terms of why we developed agriculture when we did, there are a few schools of thought. Traditionally (and not widely agreed with nowadays), there was some kind of Cultural Revolution possibly brought about by the end of the Ice Age that enabled humanity to invent agriculture in a fit of Progress. When I was an undergrad a decade ago, we were taught that it was more likely in response to population pressure and potentially even famine. The choice was figure out how to control food production, or die. People chose the former even though the food produced was more labor intensive and inferior. (This Discover Magazine piece by Jared Diamond was hot shit in my Intro to Anthropology class circa 2000. No idea if it's still relevant.) More and more now, alternate theories are being thrown out there. Patrick McGovern has speculated that humans invented staple-crop agriculture in order to make beer, as opposed to the more traditional idea that humans domesticated wheat and then discovered you could use it to make beer. I'm sure there are other theories as well that aren't quite as sexy.  TL;DR: We invented agriculture, possibly out of necessity. Then everything else followed."
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,sarasmirks,43,Mon Jul 20 04:15:22 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the theory that all of human civilization can be traced back to wanting beer.
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,doodeman,24,Mon Jul 20 11:36:21 2015 UTC,"My favorite idea was that, since both (leavened) bread and beer are made by taking a mash of grains and waiting for fermentation, we can't tell which one they were trying for and which was an accident."
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,squidfood,12,Mon Jul 20 16:45:49 2015 UTC,They may both have been accidents. Mashing grain and adding water and herbs to taste seems like a sensible way to make a simple meal.
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,PhysicalStuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say both were an accident. It's much easier to leave some grains where they get wet and forgotten about for a while to then taste them, and possibly to throw the mass into a fire to see what happens. Though at the very least I'd expect people to some passing familiarity with alcohol (because humans sure as hell aren't the only ones in nature to seek out alcohol) long before the point of bread-baking. I could also imagine the cultivation of fermented fruit for alcohol (given that once it's started it's easy to continue the fermentation) and likely the incidental adding of grains into the mix as well."

AskAnthropology,3dwduc,divinesleeper,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:11:13 2015 UTC,But you get more calories per amount of time and calories put in. That's the whole point of settling down to be a sedentary farmer.

Drop a few sunflower seeds over here and sunflowers will grow. As opposed to what you would see today, a cultivated field of sunflowers. You lose efficiency due to not having that rigid neat plot type structure, but for people still living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle with no pressure to get the absolute highest possible yields, that would be fine.  I'm a little bit curious how defensive capabilities would have influenced these types of horticulturalist or proto-agriculture societies, but a brush garden would have been easy for anyone passing through to recognize and forage."
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,sarasmirks,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"Would tribes be competing so far in the past? Do we suspect that there has always been aggression between rival groups, or would people have been spaced out enough / rare enough to encounter that they would be welcomed?"
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,Asiriya,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"I have no idea the answer to this, but I'd be curious to know.  If there was conflict for resources (which I really really don't know about at all), it would probably more likely been access to rare or obviously advantageous things rather than something like a brush garden plot. If you want to make your own brush garden, just go drop some seeds in a nice spot that's good for growing that thing.

AskAnthropology,3dwduc,Banko,15,Mon Jul 20 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"One important, albeit contentious, theory to note is what's called behavioral modernity. Basically, while we have evidence of anatomically modern remains as far back as 150,000 years ago, the material record might indicate that humans didn't begin to express behavioral traits of modern humans until 50,000 years ago."
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,MrPrimeMover,16,Mon Jul 20 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"Behavioral modernity is quickly becoming an outdated concept. It relies heavily on looking at the European Upper Paleolithic Revolution as a de novo phenomenon. With more finds and newer dating techniques developed from the '80s on, there is ever-increasing evidence for the criteria for behavioral modernity developing in the African Middle Stone Age -- symbolic art, bone tools, long-distance trade, blade technology, etc. Sally McBrearty and Alison Brooks have an extremely thorough run-down of all these  categories of artifact found in the MSA: The Revolution That Wasn't."
AskAnthropology,3dwduc,Snugglerific,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:01 2015 UTC,I think this is a plausible argument too. We have little way of knowing how similar of different the behavioral traits were then and now.

AskAnthropology,3dwduc,SoundsTasty,12,Mon Jul 20 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"Good question! People have modelled the effect of population size and cultural diversity, and found that low population, low density societies (like those in the Palaeolithic) struggle to maintain many cultural innovations. Put simply, it's difficult to develop specialist knowledge like farming when you can only afford to have one or two specialists in your group, because they could easily die without passing the knowledge on. Larger populations have more chance of retaining innovations because they can spread them around a larger pool of people. So it's been suggested that Palaeolithic societies were simply too small to retain all the specialist technological innovations something like agriculture needs, but in the region of 45,000–5,000 years ago populations crossed successive thresholds that allowed them to develop modern human behaviour and eventually farming, writing, etc."

Did the distribution and density of human populations gradually and continually increase from the evolution of anatomically modern humans to the ""key point"" 45,000 years ago when density was high enough that those ""modern human"" behaviors could be developed?  Or was there some event that boosted human population 45,000 years ago?

The conventional story is that the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the more hospitable Holocene epoch 11,000 years ago triggered a population explosion and subsequently various technological and social ""revolutions"". But that's hard to square with the fact that many key innovations happened way earlier, or that much of the world retained ""Pleistocene"" lifestyles until thousands of years into the Holocene. I think human populations have probably more or less followed an exponential growth pattern since we began spreading across the world – with hiccoughs like glaciations and accelerated periods like the beginning of the Holocene, sure – and so complex cultural traits just slowly accumulated."

It covers more than just the period you specify and it is not a massively in depth book in anthropological terms but it gives a very clear picture of what we know for certain, what we suspect and what we do not know at all about human behaviours in your specified time period.

Then once a tin handful of people discovered those plants, they had to diffuse outward from there.  And be re engineered for new climes.  I am writing a book about the last 45,000 years when things speed up a bit.   Most of the innovations you refer to happen within that period.  There's probably a change in the brain around 50-60,000 years ago.  The book is at 500 pages and I don't have time to type it it here, ha, but certainly answers your question.

I am guessing that neither you nor your immediate an retire have invented nothing of note, nor your friends or teachers.  If you are clever and lucky you may have recombined some existing things in a novel way. By now, there are lots of prior inventions to use.  Like the words we are typing and writing.    There's a vast literature on how new words come into being.  You can't just start a new word and have it be understood by lots of people. It takes time and sometimes necessity and lots of other factors  I am in my 43rd year of formal study of anthropology and the details of answering this question for just one region can easily take a year of graduate work.  No easy answer to the basic questions of human. Existence.  But people in general aren't that studies, quick or good at remembering things.  People at 28,000bp may really have been far quicker and more inventive as individuals than most individuals are today.

I would cite Göbekli Tepe as an example of this. The site appears to have had some sort of cultural or possibly religious significance for its builders, and at nearly 12 000 years old, is one of the earliest known stone structures. Evidence around the site indicates that the builders were nomadic, yet they seem to have a highly developed ability to shape, move and erect stones.  As has been mentioned by others, I think its likely that a lack of population density may have hindered the development of material technology, probably because learning to make new tools or develop new methods of producing food is time consuming. However, cultural beliefs and practices can be passed and taught without interfering with other life aspects, specifically, its easier to pass on knowledge or beliefs that do not require experimentation or manual manipulation on the part of the teacher or student. You could call that a hypothesis though, I have no way to test it. I think it's likely that the complexities of human language and cultural beliefs have been present for much longer than material technological advances."

AskAnthropology,3dtb7d,Nora_Oie,25,Tue Jul 21 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"So, it turns out that humans have TONS of workarounds for this.   For one thing, the way that language works has a lot of handy lifehacks for helping people learn how to avoid danger. I mean, language in general is huge in this regard. Think about actually being around a toddler, and how often you have to say things like ""don't touch the stove"", ""don't climb the furniture"", etc. People before modern society would be replacing all that with ""don't touch that mushroom"" and ""don't play where there might be snakes"", etc.   Secondly, there are a lot of theories that some aspects of human language might have worked as a tool to help people learn and categorize the sheer amount of stuff you have to know about avoiding danger. I'm not sure how accepted this is in modern anthropological scholarship, but back in the 80s linguist George Lakoff theorized that noun classes (for instance when you take French and you have to learn that ""table"" is feminine while ""tree"" is masculine) may have evolved to provide handy linguistic categories that helped people divide dangerous things from safe things, which berries are poisonous, etc. So according to Lakoff, when you're a toddler learning language, you're also getting it packaged with background information that you should never eat Death Cap mushrooms.  Also, y'know, we have words like ""Death Cap Mushroom"", ""Poison Ivy"", ""Snakeroot"", etc. which are pretty self-explanatory.   Keep in mind, too, that when the majority of what you're doing is gathering and hunting for food in the wild, and you see your parents and siblings doing this pretty much from birth, and you are with them as they do it, you learn a lot really quickly. All the information we need to impart to modern children about not playing with matches, not talking to strangers, look both ways when crossing the street, etc. would be replaced with how to behave safely in a hunting/gathering society.   I even have a personal anecdote about this from an adult perspective. I just spent a month living and working on a farm in rural Italy. We used a lot of wild-foraged herbs and greens in the meals we cooked. Most of the people on the farm were city people who don't know how to find wild foods. So someone who had been there awhile would teach us. One thing I learned was how to forage and prepare stinging nettle, which definitely falls into the category of poisonous plants. It was pretty easy to learn to always wear gloves when you pick it, always cut it with scissors rather than trying to pull with your fingers, and always blanch it to remove the sting rather than putting it in a salad or something. I imagine that, in a culture where this was normal everyday life rather than a vacation, you would learn all these things as a small child, in exactly the same way I learned them as an adult."

The form it usually takes is a woman marrying a set of brothers so that their land wealth doesn't have to be divided among their children when they die. Like all other polygamous societies though, having multiple spouses is like having a Bentley, or an indoor swimming pool.  Something or the very well off only.  The top 5-10% maybe.

AskAnthropology,3dqjuk,ggchappell,15,Sat Jul 18 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, polyandry is common in societies with high male mortality or high make absenteeism.   I assume you are getting that info from the Wikipedia article on polyandry, which says,   [Polyandry] is most common in egalitarian societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism. It is associated with partible paternity, the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father.   The citation for those two sentences is for the first two pages of ""A Survey of Non-Classical Polyandry"", by K. Starkweather & R. Hames. The first page of that article mentions ""male mortality"" (the mention is in the abstract), while the second page mentions ""partible paternity"". So the citation for the ""male mortality"" information is from the abstract of the article. Here is what this actually says:   Our analysis reveals that [polyandry] may be a predictable response to a high operational sex ratio favoring males and may also be a response to high rates of male mortality and, possibly, male absenteeism.   Note the use of ""may"". Also note that the primary phenomenon that they are suggesting polyandry may be a response to, is ""a high operational sex ratio favoring males"" -- which makes rather more sense, I think. So the Wikipedia article is not making an entirely accurate summary of the information from its source.  Nonetheless, Starkweather & Hames do mention male mortality and absenteeism as factors leading to polyandry. The section discussing this starts on the 4th page of the article. Here, for example, is what it says about high male mortality:   Alternatively, given high male mortality among Inuit men, this arrangement could be a consequence of the father effect explored below.  Father effect refers here to the consequences for the survival and well-being of a child should the biological father die and is inspired by Beckerman’s research on partible paternity (Beckerman et al. 1998). Partible paternity often leads to informal polyandry, which we defined earlier. In a number of the societies that believe a child can have more than one father, men who had sex with the mother in the months prior to parturition are identified as fathers and provide paternal investment not only in terms of food but in social and political support as well. Among the Bari, Beckerman et al. (1998) showed that children who had two fathers were significantly more likely to survive to age 15 than children who had one. Similar results were demonstrated for the Ache (Hill and Hurtado 1996).   And that seems to make sense, too.  EDIT. Spelling."

AskAnthropology,3dq1ko,bingbongbizzle,40,Sat Jul 18 09:36:14 2015 UTC,"Simply put, languages consistently show greater degrees of dialect diversity in the areas where the language has been spoken the longest. That idea can be taken too far, but generally it holds true. The ancestral homeland of any language group, so long as it's still currently spoken there, should be expected to have a great many more regional variations (accents, dialects, what have you) than places where the language is a more recent thing.  Quoting from Campbell's Historical Linguistics (2013):   In linguistics migration theory, the homeland of a language family is inferred to be in the area represented by the greatest diversity (largest number of subgroups) for which the minimum number of moves (migrations) would be required to bring the speakers of the diverse languages back to noe place. On the whole, the inferences afforded by this method are strong, and few documented cases fail to conform.   There are of course ways for this not to work, such as if the language were to stop being spoken in the homeland due to some major disaster or war or something of that sort. Generally though, it works out.  England has a huge number of varieties of English because English has been spoken longer in England than anywhere else in the world. You see a similar thing happening with American English (ignoring recent immigration) where in New England, where English has been spoken for a very long time, you have a greater number or regional accents than some place like California where it's relatively new and homogenous.   There are of course other factors at play when it comes to regional dialectal variation, especially in a place like North America, but the primary reason is just that English has been there longer, and language varieties are constantly diverging even in the face of modern media and the internet."
AskAnthropology,3dq1ko,keyilan,7,Sat Jul 18 09:50:36 2015 UTC,"In Australia there are in fact very few regional accents, and most Aussies cant tell a Queenslander from Tasmanian.

There is a change from rural areas to city areas, whether you'd call them regional accents I'm not so sure (country Australians have a far broader 'Ozzie' accent on the whole that city people, this could also be a class thing as well). I think this is because the accent is so very new, probably less than 150 years at best)."
AskAnthropology,3dq1ko,Thecna2,9,Sat Jul 18 12:56:02 2015 UTC,"While this is generally true, that people more or less fall within a pretty linear spectrum between super broad and super posh, with the vast majority of Aussies falling somewhere comfortably in the middle, you are still seeing some ongoing changes toward diversification. This isn't necessarily a vocabulary thing like pint/schooner/pot/middy but rather an accentual shift in pronunciation, so that you find things like a distinct Melbourne accent developing in the urban area but not really spreading far into Country Victoria, the most notable difference being things like the /ɛ/ vowel in certain words shifting toward /æ/, so pronunciations more like ""Malbourne"" or ""yallow"".  So, if I'm not mistaken (or at least this is one way I've heard it described recently), General Australian is kinda doing this clockwise rotation of the vowel sounds kinda like New Zealand has in certain regards, but then Melbourne is kinda rotating the other way. That's an oversimplification, and I can't really speak to it in much more detail having not read the latest research, but that's the gist of it.  And yeah it's most definitely a class thing, and then you're also seeing a huge show of ""ethnolects"" among second generation Aussies though this is more regional (from where their families came from) than it is along specific ethic lines, so children of Lebanese and Greek immigrants who've grown up tend to have a more general Mediterranean-Aussie accent, though again there's a stark difference between those in Sydney and those in Melbourne. I've heard that this is much less stark in Sydney.  It's all really interesting stuff. Wish I had more time to read up on it.  tl;dr: You're right, but it's also moving toward diversification."

They suffered from all kinds of ailments like scurvy, gonorrhea, possibly things like parasites or tape worms. A normal healthy kind of tall person like 6'3"" would have seemed very large to them.  ""Skin harder than a bull"" ""struck twice before he could fetch blood"" bull shit, probably trying to make excuses for why they lost the men or the mission failed.  ""I asked whether they had many giants there. The Captain said there was an island in sight where they were even larger, as much as 8 and a half feet"" So they never really even saw the super tall people. Probably the Captain didn't want them to go to that island and was trying to scare them away. Also this proves that the people they did see may have only been 7 feet tall, since they were shorter than 8 feet. So not giants even if we do take those claims to be true.  ""On this voyage, we have seen men's bones very much larger than the ones I have just mentioned"" Once again they haven't seen the actual tall people. Even if they are telling truth about seeing large bones, and once again not exaggerating how large they are, these could easily be the bones of some other animal. These people would have been encountering new animals every day, never-before-seen by Europeans. Highly likely they could have mistaken some other animal for a human. They may be seeing old fossilized bones of a giant sloth for instance? Or the arm bones of a new world monkey, which would appear very disproportionately large.  In general there are way too many lies, mis-classifications, and exaggerations coming from explorers of that time period to take any of these claims seriously.

They are volcanic islands which had never been connected to a continent, so the likely hood of that is not high. Also, the text says that they locals would leave their daed out in the open to rot, so they could use the bones to make weapons. Ive found some other interesting sources that indicate the Chamorros of the Marinas to have the biggest femur(?) bones of any humans found at that time, meaning they may have in fact been the stronger and biggest humans discovered of that era. Ill try to re-find my source!  Actually its the same source that /u/Sie_Sayoka gave.

They aren't exactly superheroes or anything from legend. From a scientific perspective you would only need to be toward the top end of a graph with the median or mean near the center, and the dispersement of heights amongst the population would be statistically significant to say they are taller, but some of them would have still been shorter than average europeans, others would have been the same size, and a few would have undoubtedly been much taller maybe 6'5"" even which would have been absolutely huge for that day and age. If statistically they are a couple inches taller that would be something people would notice for sure. But even according to these numbers I still highly doubt even 5% of the population were over 6 feet tall. I hope this answers that part of your question.  As far as the bones being buried on the beach, it kind of proves my point of, if there are so many bones available everywhere, why didn't they take a few and bring them back as proof? And let's still not rule out the possibility that the ""giant bones"" they were looking at were actually orangutan femurs or tibias or whatever. (I mistakenly said new world monkeys in my original post, which are much smaller than orangs anyway, forgetting these explorers were actually in Oceania not the new world). The fact that they were not connected to the mainland and didn't have large mammals, definitely does not rule out the presence of bones from the mainland. Trade with the mainland would have been something that occasionally happened during these times. And we know now that many Asian cultures prized and loved to trade animal bones for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. These dudes rode around in canoes and rafts and maybe even outriggers? going long distances using shells and beads, among other items, as currency.  Still though, I'm leaning toward the giant people stories being completely made up. Too many Marco Polo stories out there to let me believe anything these explorers say, especially when there is zero evidence of giants, or even very tall people, to back it up. I just watched a documentary on Netflix last night about the search for El Dorado, and all the stories locals told the Europeans about cities of gold and a chief who bathed in gold and tossed gold figurines into the lake. Spanish explorers spent fortunes looking for it, draining lakes and some even traversed the Andes AND THEN the entire Amazon river to the Atlantic such as Pizzaro and the doomed Aguirre (a great movie was made about it by my hero Werner Herzog, Aguirre, the Wrath of God). Obviously it ended up being a combination of myth and lies. So between lying explorers and lying natives, not hard to surmise that likely the giants didn't exist.

Yonaguni lies in an earthquake-prone region; such earthquakes tend to fracture the rocks in a regular manner.""[2][4] He also observes that on the northeast coast of Yonaguni there are regular formations similar to those seen at the monument.[2][8] Schoch also believes that the ""drawings"" identified by Kimura are natural scratches on the rocks.[4] This is also the view of John Anthony West[5] who suggests that ""walls"" are simply natural horizontal platforms which fell into a vertical position when rock below them eroded and the alleged roads are simply channels in the rock.[9] Patrick D. Nunn, Professor of Oceanic Geoscience at the University of the South Pacific, has studied these structures extensively and notes that the structures below the water continue in the Sanninudai slate cliffs above, which have ""been fashioned solely by natural processes,"" and concludes in regard to the underwater structures that ""there seems no reason to suppose that they are artificial.""[10]"

AskAnthropology,3djq5h,augustelantier,33,Thu Jul 16 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a proper anthropologist, but I do have a background in ancient Greek literature, and I think that this tidbit may be enlightening.   In Plato's Symposium, the speech of Aristophanes is a short mythology of the origins of love. The details of the myth are not really that important, the basic gist is that soulmates are two halves of a dual-human protoform. But this particular quote provides some insight:  ""Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like a flat-fish the traces of having been sliced in two; and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him. All the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are woman-courters; our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex, [191e] whence likewise are derived our man-courting women and adulteresses. All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men: they are inclined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions. Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be slices of the male by making friends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men's embraces""  Basically, this shows that the ancient Greeks were certainly not unaware that people have certain preferences. This would seem to suggest that these preferences do have an innate quality to them. The difference is that the modern labels of ""homosexual"" or ""herterosexual"" didn't exist, and the societal preference to herterosexuality did not exist either.  That is not to say that labels or societal preferences didn'texist, though. In fact, the majority of the speakers in the symposium speak of érōs, intimate love solely between two male lovers: an older mentor, the erastḗs and a younger ward an erṓmenos. While marriage was between a man and a woman was expected, an overt fondness for the opposite sex was regarded with suspicion, as  Aristophanes calls them ""moichōn,"" adulterer and moicheutria adulteress, suggesting that people who actually loved the opposite sex more than necessary were liable to be home wreckers. Finally, we have lesbian relationships, which were far more taboo than the other two. It's hard to say exactly how the Athenians felt about these kind of relationships, because they certainly didn't write about them much. It's rather telling that the term Aristophanes calls them, hetairistriai (literally she-minion, probably a lesbian prostitute), is unique to this rather unusual passage in Greek literature. Nothing else is really said about them, but hetairistriai isn't exactly a term of endearment.  So basically to answer your question: from this example it would seem that preferences for a certain partner are intrinsic to human nature. Some people like men, some like women, some like both, some like neither. What is variable is the attitudes a certain culture will have to those preferences. In ancient Athens, being a gay man was respected, being straight was tolerated, and being a lesbian was kept under wraps. In all three cases you were expected to marry and produce children, but you were most definitely not expected to love your spouse."
AskAnthropology,3djq5h,herrcoffey,6,Fri Jul 17 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"I think you might benefit from reading Foucault's History of Sexuality. Since that's a history that appears in three big volumes I realise it's not everyone's light after-dinner reading, but it would be really informative on all of the above.  To summarise briefly, the first volume deals with the last two centuries and how discussion about sexuality proliferated and turned sexuality into a scientific or medical concept; it also deals a lot with the concept of biopower, or controlling population in physically regulatory ways. The second volume discusses Greek and Roman sexuality, and the third the relationship of sexuality and the self.   It's long and fairly dense reading, but I would say it's one of, if not the most influential work in anthropology of sexuality - although Foucault was not an anthropologist he was a huge inspiration to many anthropologists and other scholars of sexuality including Gayle Rubin."

AskAnthropology,3dn4ho,sarasmirks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"For the most part, there is no real evidence that human religion on earth is directly related to evolution. There are so many types of religious belief on our planet. Like, so, so many. More than you could possibly be aware of. More than anyone who isn't an anthropologist specializing in religion would be aware of. Further to that, in modern times we have a deceptively homogeneous religious landscape because a few religions historically have managed to dominate wide swaths of human culture. Before Christianity and Islam, religion among humans probably would have been even more diverse than the pretty intense levels of diversity that currently exist.  So I say, in terms of religion, have them believe whatever you want, or whatever is in service of the story. You might benefit from reading up on non-Judeo-Christian or non-proselytizing religions to get some inspiration, but you could just make up whatever you want and it would be equally valid.  Since you are already decided that they have an Alpha/Omega social structure like canids, and it sounds like basically you've invented Dog People, why not play with that a bit more? What kind of religion would a wolf have? If you're set on them living in a plains ecosystem, why not study the indigenous religions of places like the Seregeti and the Eurasian steppes?  FWIW, it's also probably worth remembering that, in most SF, society, religion, and the like really tend to only come into the story because the author is trying to make some type of point or draw parallels to something she or he wants the reader to consider. If you're not trying to make any particular point, you could just leave religion out of it entirely. I have no idea what if any religion Starfleet Officers have in Star Trek, because that's not important to the story. On the other hand, Star Wars is full of details about the Jedi spiritual system because the whole story hinges on this mystical/religious order and its practices."

I'm not the kind of expert that would post in /r/askhistorians, but my sense is this community is smaller and thirstier for answers. Let me know if I shouldn't post.  JujuAdam is correct that nationalism is an anachronistic term for this time period. Do you mean to ask whether religion showed up because it strengthens social bonds or pride in a society? That's an effect of religion, but calling it the origin story is too pat and functionalist for me.  I'm not too familiar with (which?) Native American henotheism, and only slightly with Hinduism, but the Mediterranean pre-Christian pantheons doesn't strike me as competing mascots. People tended to cross-identify or subsume (e.g. foreign gods viewed as an aspect of Jupiter by Roman soldiers) more than pit their gods against each other.  The Abrahamic religions are obviously different, and maybe that's what you're talking about when you mention the origin of ""religion"". But this seems to me like a departure from the henotheism practiced by their neighbours. Are you arguing that these became successful because of this exclusionary quality?"

The idea of worshiping a single god was paralleled with obeying a single church and a single priesthood, instead of various gods and temples that could be patronized. I'm assuming the Hebrews were originally Canaanite peoples who worshiped Yahweh as the supreme deity and ascended to dominance in the area."

Organized religion and organized government seem to begin as sides (not necessarily opposite) of the same coin; one serving as the justification of power, the other being its manifestation.  Another fascinating subject which might relate to the question is Göbekli Tepe, the very earliest site which would have required an organized government to create, which seems to have been a temple complex from 12,000 years ago (this has reversed the previous common assumption that religion arose as a sort of epiphenomenon of civilization)."

But that's what you get for asking anthropologists ;)   You are comparing apples and oranges. If your first example is people living in England (i.e., people living in Sheffield and Spalding respectively), your second example should not be ""Hadza people"" but ""Tanzanian people"".  You are assuming that ethnic groups such as the Hadza have a more homogenous existence than Sheffielders. This is not necessarily the case. I remember a link someone posted in /r/anthropology not that long ago: Hunter-gatherers use Facebook and watch Premier League football on TV, says archaeologist. This bears out in my own fieldwork in Tanzania as well, by the way. People are always in contact with their neighbours, they move around, and these days everyone has mobile phones and yeah, they're all on facebook, they join fan clubs for Arsenal or Manchester United, etc.   Anyway, as for your question, there's an entire subfield of anthropology that discusses questions like this, and that is political anthropology. Even if you narrow it down to just questions of nationalism and how the nation-state appears in people's lives and in what capacity, there's a ton of literature, so it's a bit difficult to give an overview of such a big area.  To continue with your Tanzanian example, basically everyone in Tanzania is talking about election politics right now. Whether it's bitching about CCM or how Lowassa didn't get the presidential nomination or how these biometric voter registration machines are great or they're the worst thing ever, etc. etc. People all over the country were also affected colonial rule, and as well they share the legacy of ujamaa socialism. Of course it didn't affect everyone the same way, but it is a common historical context that has current meaning in many ways.

Maybe what I am asking - is the way we define what is culture varies between how we view it in the context of a nation and a smaller homogenous group like a tribe, or the number of sub cultures it has?   Yes, context is crucial. After World War 2, the recognition of globalization became an undeniably huge underlying issue which challenged the idea of the existence of unitary cultures in the first place.   Personally I think some countries can sometimes agree on what comprises ""their culture."" But I'm afraid that might play too fast and loose, which would oversimplify the issue.  ""There is now a world culture, but we had better make sure we understand what this means. It is marked by an organization of diversity rather than a replication of uniformity."" -Ulf Hannerz  Marshall Sahlins described this as a ""Culture of cultures.""

Ethnic identity and occupation... the list could go on and on. I guess you could say I'm a ""splitter"" when it comes to culture... I envision a smorgasbord of cultures and subcultures. This ""pattern"" you may have picked up by virtue of being an African-American. This one may be shared by all or most Americans. This one by virtue of living in the rural south. This one by virtue of participating in a trans-national hip hop culture. This pattern may have come from the fact that your parents are baptists. All of these interact and work together.

There was a push, largely in the 1980s-90s, to abandon the concept of culture entirely for some of the reasons you mention.   To take your example of class, Marxism and Marxist influenced schools have analyzed things based on class relations rather than culture. The traditional concept of culture emphasized a uniformity or coherence of culture while Marxists saw conflict as the basis of society. (I use society advisedly here because Marxists used that term rather than culture.) Political economy, as exemplified especially by Eric Wolf, added to this by taking a global perspective. In a nutshell, Wolf and others argued that societies were not separate things but interconnected on a global and historical scale. They also emphasized that historical approach -- societies were not just unstable in the present, but also over time.  There are a number of alternatives or modifications to the concept of culture that have been developed like actor-network theory (let's look at things through the interconnections among things and people) and standpoint epistemology (let's look at things from the standpoint of race, gender, class, etc.)."

You won't be accepted to any masters program without having taken these requirements, eg. biology, chemistry, statistics, etc. Most students that have a bachelor's in an unrelated field take these courses at a community college before applying to the masters program. There's usually not too much variation among programs as medicine is a very standardized field, but you should still look at programs you may be interested in and look at their specific requirements.   Before you get an advanced nursing degree you will have to become a registered nurse (RN) by taking and passing the NCLEX-RN. Numerous schools have a program in which students do basic coursework for a year, then once they take and pass the NCLEX-RN, are able to proceed and complete their masters within the same program. Here is an example of one.   Edit: I'd also check out this too. Hope this helps!"

He did internships with JP Morgan (i think, iirc) every summer/year of his studies and after 4 years they really, really, wanted him to work there.    Obviously that's a little difficult to do after you've graduated. But if you do or did have any experience in anything try and segway that into something. Like I did a journalism internship and using that to get into PR. Something like that.     If you've already graduated look for an internship, something 6 months or so for recent grads. The job search can take that long so it isn't the worst idea or way to spend the time. Plus since you already graduated might be able to get one that's paid or has a stipend. I know the U.N. has a bunch of internships available and you def could get into a variety of things with those (there's a lot), potentially travel to work (if that's what you want to do), and definitely help use that to transition into whatever field you want to get into.

From what I remember it was equal parts ethnographic observation and memoir. He wasn't very guarded about the things in the world which motivated him to do what he did, which was very informative and I think very honest.   I see academia as a structure of social and economic incentives which move people to act in certain ways, write in certain ways, and interpret the world in certain ways in accordance with those incentives. That is not a truth which I perceive as being very openly addressed in the writing of many modern-day anthros, even as reflexivity is supposedly embraced. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I have yet to encounter a manuscript which reads ""I chose this theoretical approach because it's the one most likely to get me a tenure track position in an overcrowded employment marketplace""  And I guess it's true that he didn't write at length about the fact that spending time in the jungle and finding a grand theory would make him a famous theorist and that's what moved him, but what I read of Levi-Strauss's work left me with the impression of being very, even surprisingly open and transparent in talking about what motivated him to go deeper into the jungle to find ""unspoiled"" culture, which I actually appreciated very much."

You might have to get a side gig working at a place not so high on your list while you pursue an entry level position or unpaid internship.

AskAnthropology,3cy6ov,Llamacalypse,26,Sat Jul 11 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: English is not my primary language, so if something is off, I apologize.  I think the concept of natural is hard to define in a discussion like this. Since human societies and its attributes are defined and develop historically, where exactly would you say ""this is the natural order""?  For instance, /u/welearntolive has cited Big Men societies an example of hierarchical order that may be part of a ""natural"" society. But Marshall Sahlins studied contemporary groups, and thus the situations he describes are the result of thousands of years of historical development. Are they natural?  Also, is capitalist society natural, or not? One could argue that it is, in the sense that it is how some (pretty large) human groups have come to be, and that it was part of the process of development of humanity in its environment, and both humans and the environment are nature. But also, I wouldn't say capitalism is the natural order, since there are many other possibilities in the past, present and future.  'Default' means that you are thinking of a society in a vacuum, with no environment, no history, no ongoing process of change. This has never existed, since even the first 'human' societies were the result of a previous development that shaped them in contingent conditions.   Think of this: at one point, most of the world was unpopulated by humans, so in order to expand themselves (which IMO was not a necessary phenomenon, but it is what happened anyway) societies had to have a mechanism to split and create more people and more societal units. But then, when territories were filled, these mechanism had to change in order to prevent overpopulation (birth control) or transform the means of production in order to provide for more people (e.g. agriculture). So, what is natural of the above example?  Personally, I don't think one could define a 'default' or 'natural' order of human societies, given the above. I do think that there might be laws or regularities in the way that human society has shaped itself according to its historical development, its everchanging environment, etc. And the frame I think is the best to look and understand those regularities, is historical materialism, but that is a topic for another discussion obviously.  That said, the first human societies were probably egalitarian, in the sense that there was no differentiation in the access to the products of social labour, and no private property of any of the factors of production itself. That doesn't mean there wasn't any division of labour, no hierarchies or leaderships, and no conflict. Probably gender and age were one of the most common divisions, but I wouldn't necessarily jump to generalize what we have seen in modern hunter-gatherers to those societies in the distant past.  TL;DR: I'm sorry, anthropology is like this :(."

There's the idea that we can peel away the layers of culture and find some pure biological core or ""state of nature."" But humans have always been enculturated.

If you want text to function as a link - like OP did - this means there will be two parentheses at the end (because the way to format a link with your own text includes enclosing the URL in it's own set of parentheses - more detailed guides to how to do this is at the end of my comment). We must break up the formatting with a special character in order for our link to work properly.   Please ignore the spaces inserted into the examples below. They must be removed to actually make the links function.  The formula is: [Your text] (paste the URL here)   If the URL has parentheses included in it, like the wiki link does, it looks like this: [Your text] (paste the URL here (anthro) )   Notice the double parentheses at the end - those buggers are the problem.   So, when linking to a URL which ends with a closing parentheses, you have to escape the closing parentheses with a simple backslash. One of these \   I'll use the wiki link above as our example. All you have to do is place a backslash before the double parentheses, and after the word ""anthropology"" in the URL. In other words, insert a backslash in between the word ""anthropology"" and the final two parentheses, like so:  [Your text] (paste the URL here (antro \ ) )   It's really important to remember to put an actual backslash \ and not the forward slash / that's more commonly used, or your link won't work.

I think it depends largely on the environmental factors; in places where hunting and gathering is made possible (through the abundance of the environment), people still live in immediate return, egalitarian societies with basic divisions along gender lines (look up info on the Hadza tribe, for example).  In rougher environments, where food isn't available all year round, I would theorise that delayed return societies, with more of a rigid social structure, can emerge. The moment humans have to store food, a balance of power emerges between those who get to control the food stores, those who work to fill the works stores, those who don't have access to the food stores at all, etc.   But having said all that, there's nothing ""default"" about human nature - the further you delve into ethnographic studies, the more you realise that."

The average ""common"" experience is very boring and it would fail as a TV show  or as a movie.  The most accurate imo would be Freaks and Geeks for the somewhat ""common"" teenager in High School. However, the show was short lived and tried a little too hard. It was a great show. I just think it didn't get a chance to get going properly.   If I were to choose a movie I'd have to list Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Though all of the actors are in their 20's. The movie does get the look of the school and rooms right and some teachers are as dull as those portrayed. The hormone levels are perfect for the main characters. And even though Spicoli is a little over the edge of reality for mainstream America, he might be more realistic in a California school system.   And probably the best TV series to ever tackle the average American life in school is The Wonder Years. It is based in the late 60's and early 70's, but the interactions never really change. They just get more hormone driven and drugs are introduced into some lives.  The last show I'll mention only because I've heard great things about it; DeGrassi TNG. I've never seen an episode, but it was always complimented because of how it handled daily issues in the life of a teen. Whether they get the classroom or interactions right; I couldn't really say.

In archaeology, Bruce Trigger claimed that the field had become dominated by the ""pragmatic synthesis"" of processualism and post-processualism. However, I think what may be becoming the most pressing concern is the theoretical and practical question of the integration of applied and academic anthropology.

The uniting trait of these languages is the 3 letter root. But ethnically the word Semitic is linked to Judaism. But ethnically Arabs, Jews, and other ethnic groups in the region are Semites.   I think it's survival is the use of the word ""Antisemitism"", which has been in use since the late 1800s. But /r/linguistics  might know more!  As a side note: I'm Syrian and not Jewish but consider myself a Semite, because it's the only catch-all term I can think of to describe a large common ethnic/cultural group in the Middle East.

Japhetic was one of those names, but it has just happened that ""Indo-European"" prevailed; I don't think there is any particular reason why that particular name prevailed.  The term Hamitic was used to refer to a supposed language family consisting of the Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic and Omotic languages. The Hamitic languages were in turn thought to be related to the Semitic languages in the Hamito-Semitic language family. In Joseph Greenberg's classification of the languages of Africa, he accepted Hamito-Semitic but showed that there was no evidence for the Hamitic subgrouping, and therefore proposed renaming the Hamito-Semitic language family as the Afro-Asiatic language family. This has become the standard view on the relationships of these languages in linguistics so the name has stuck. There have been many new proposals on how to subgroup the Afro-Asiatic languages, none of which have gained wide acceptance, but as far as I know none of them have resurrected the Hamitic subgroup.  There is no doubt that the Semitic languages are genetically related; the family is relatively tight-knit and many of the languages are attested from very early dates when they were more similar to each other."

On the individual level, memories of historical events are open to confabulation even within a single lifetime. Ulric Neisser demonstrated this with his study of flashbulb memories of the Challenger crash. This phenomenon has also been replicated with other historical events such as 9/11.  The problem is scaling this up to social memory. I have not seen much work in this vein, but one book is Paul Connerton's How Societies Remember. It incorporates experimental psychology with historical studies and the work of Maurice Halbwachs. Connerton focuses on collective memory as embodied in social practice such as ritual rather than as transmission through writing or other media. The book is getting dated though (1989).

AskAnthropology,3cmokl,bob_newhart_of_dixie,27,Thu Jul 9 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"Aboriginal, via the etymology that /u/tripostrophe supplied, implies a secondary originality: 'from the beginning'. The origin takes place elsewhere; it arrives when the colonization begins, when a dominant culture prescribes their own mytho-historical origin from which the ab-origines arise. There's a teleology inherent in the use of 'original' which implies a hierarchy of cultures which has to be rejected when one rejects the inherent superiority of Western over other civilizations, or conversely when it is understood that the first people in contact with the West in a land newly discovered by the West are not necessarily the first 'people' there. Seeing as most of social science has undergone this rejection and related comprehension, it makes sense for the field to use a term that implies less of an inherent bias, and which therefore casts a less dubious light on presented work. The term 'indigenous' is less loaded than 'original', as it's tied more to material location and less to historical processes, and is therefore more in line with the objectivity of physical science."

AskAnthropology,3cj9dz,YouRemindMeOfYou,63,Wed Jul 8 10:04:15 2015 UTC,"Here's a definition of the term ""cult"" from a psych PhD specialized in the phenomenon (emphasis mine):    Cult (totalist type): A group or movement exhibiting a great or excessive devotion or dedication to some person, idea, or thing and employing unethically manipulative techniques of persuasion and control (e.g. isolation from former friends and family, debilitation, use of special methods to heighten suggestibility and subservience, powerful group pressures, information management, suspension of individuality or critical judgment, promotion of total dependency on the group and fear of leaving it, etc.), designed to advance the goals of the group's leaders, to the actual or possible detriment of members,  their families, or the community. (West & Langone, 1986, pp. 119-120)   So, you've got three main aspects there: excessive devotion to an idea or person, unethical manipulative techniques and a focus on the group leader's interest.   To my mind, the most easy to spot (and the one that really marks a distinction between religions and cults) is the second one. Here's a checklist (same source) of cultic practices used to enforce control. Most religions do have some form of conformity enforcement, but they mainly rely on peer pressure, wherehas cults will have sophisticated techniques used to retain control of their members.  The first aspect is also interesting. Most religions won't try to control everything about their adherent's life, maybe because it just isn't practical when an organization reaches a certain size."
AskAnthropology,3cj9dz,pakap,8,Wed Jul 8 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"Every group exhibits some of the attributes of a cult, but when someone asks if x is a cult or a religion, I think they're really asking if x is bad/dangerous, so that might be a more useful point of discussion, rather than arguing the definition (I'm not saying anyone here is doing that, just that I've seen that many times with this question). There's a website called [goodcultbadcult.com](goodcultbadcult.com) that asks which unhealthy attributes a group exhibits, and how strongly. I took the test for two groups I belonged to (Seahawks fans and rationality blog community) and got back fairly low scores, and for two groups I used to belong to (the Mormon or LDS church and being s Mormon missionary) and got back high and extremely high scores, respectively.   High demand groups can have unhealthy characteristics or be benign or better, and rather than trying to label something a cult, and load the unproved negative connotations that come with it, or proving it's not a cult by some definition, and thereby imply that it has none of the harmful traits we associate with cults, it may be better to simply call it a high demand group and and name any manipulative or harmful practices it uses."

I believe the main differences are that cults have a single charismatic leader - Religions may have this but it is not required. For cults to begin, the charismatic leader shares their ideas/inspiration with others. Note that cults are different from sects, which are generally offshoots of established religions. Second, cults have a transcendent ideology. They are usually more emotional and intimate in engaging their members (although again, this can apply to certain religions). They also require a 'high level of commitment from their members in words and deeds'.  By this definition, religions like Christianity can be defined as starting out as a cult.

One contributing factor to this phenomenon is the deeply engrained societal shame surrounding sex and human sexuality.  Pregnancy is, by nature, a physical manifestation of human sexuality. While it was generally considered a (married) woman's duty to bear children and so pregnancy was to be expected, it was also an undeniable nod to the fact that sexual intercourse had taken place and therefore pregnancy was a somewhat ""unclean"" or shameful state. Obviously, this stigma applied far more to unmarried women than to married women, but to varying degrees this applied to all women.  This is evidenced by the fact that until very recently (~1990s), maternity clothing endeavored to hide the changes in the woman's body.  Today pregnant women are often referred to as ""cute"" and maternity wear is designed to accentuate the baby bump. In the days of yore, it was often considered somewhat lewd to be seen in public in a heavily pregnant state. This is of course just one reason among many.     TL;DR One possible reason, among others, for this confinement as the birth drew nearer was due to societal stigma surrounding human sexuality, which meant that it was somewhat improper for a heavily pregnant woman to be seen out and about in society."

What does 'fully notice' mean, you could argue they dont fully notice Asia now from some points, what is your definition of 'fully'. What is Europe, what is Asia? Alexander the Great conquered some of it, does that count. Rome and especially the Byzantines would have had some knowledge of it while 'Norway' at the same time would have been largely unaware.   Overall my suggestion would be from the 1500s onwards, when European expansion began, but 'Europe' wasnt unaware prior to that."
AskAnthropology,3cdita,Thecna2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:38:54 2015 UTC,More of the Asia I am asking is Far-East Asia. I should have clarified.  Why does it seem like it is never mentioned among information for the time.  Since you brought it up we will use Norway.  Why would have Norway been oblivious to their existence vs say another country of relative equal distance away from Far-East Asia. Were their society that closed or was that just how things worked?  I guess I'm just finding it hard that a country in Europe would be unaware of Far-East Asian Existence being on the same landmass.
AskAnthropology,3cdita,Turbotroll,2,Fri Jul 10 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"Being on established trade routes would have made a huge difference. Countries along the Silk Road, for instance, would know far more due to travelers and seeing the various goods passing through their marketplaces. The Romans and Han Chinese, to use the classic example, pretty much never interacted directly but were aware there were hegemonic empires on the opposite sides of the continent that were producing curious items like silk or olive oil.  ""The Chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses (named ""Heavenly horses"") in the possession of the Dayuan (literally the ""Great Ionians"", the Greek kingdoms of Central Asia), which were of capital importance in fighting the nomadic Xiongnu. The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as Seleucid Syria. ""Thus more embassies were dispatched to Anxi [Parthia], Yancai [who later joined the Alans ], Lijian [Syria under the Greek Seleucids], Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia), and Tianzhu [northwestern India]... As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six."" (Hou Hanshu, Later Han History).These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire.""  So Norway, well off the busier travel routes, may well have been oblivious to anything other than their backyard. But ""countries"" for most of history can be a rather nebulous notion, especially in Central Asia.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"
AskAnthropology,3cfdb2,warrenseth,11,Tue Jul 7 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"During my early years of grad school, a flintknapper gave a demonstration and showed us a projectile point that he had knapped from a dinosaur bone.  So fossilized bone can be conchoidally flakeable, if silica replacement is part of the bone's fossilization process.  But just because it could be done in the right circumstances doesn't mean it was done prehistorically.  I don't know of any reports of ancient people modifying dinosaur bones (by knapping or otherwise) to use as tools.  That's probably because such fossils are way more rare than the chert, obsidian, fresh bone, etc. that people usually used.  Keep in mind that dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago (unless you count birds, but I don't want to get all pedantic about it).  On the other hand, our evidence of early human tool use goes back maybe 3 million years.  That's a 62 million year gap there, so even at the earliest stages of our evolution with tools, dinosaur bones would not be much more common than they are now."

Is your question generalized with examples of ethnic groups within Tajikistan and Afghanistan, or are you specifically asking about ethnic Tajiks and Pashtun? The answer will likely vary, but I don't have one for you. I can talk about ethnic prejudice between many Central Asian/North African ethnic groups, but I personally don't know about phenotypic bias within the ethnic groups you specified.

Certain native australian groups divide themselves up into distinct ""skin colours"" and ""blood groups"", based on a complex interplay of factors relating to origin, family grouping and social relationship.  I am also not an expert on Afghan or Tajik ethnology, and i think other commenters have done a good job describing how both those countries are ethnically and culturally diverse, to the extent that they are not ""nation states"". Added to this that even within the ethnic groupings, nothing guarantees appearance to be a defining characteristic of belonging to this or that ethnic group, i think you have elements of an answer. Ethnic tension in both the countries you mentioned are intense, and have led to protracted conflict. Tajikistan ""benefits"" from having been extensively colonised by Soviets, so there is a strong cultural influence from the USSR in their relationship to ethnicity and kinship.

It's hard to know what people ate back then, especially with the variety of environments people lived in, so it's not useful to try to design a diet based on what people ate back then.

However there are differences in how your body and metabolism behaves when you eat different things. For example, increasing fiber, fat and protein consumption can actually make you eat less calories overall because you are satiated for longer.  Another example, sugar intake seems to be a determinant of obesity risk in ad libitum diets (meaning one is not following a specific diet). Sugar also has addictive properties.   The reviewed evidence supports the theory that, in some circumstances, intermittent access to sugar can lead to behavior and neurochemical changes that resemble the effects of a substance of abuse. According to the evidence in rats, intermittent access to sugar and chow is capable of producing a “dependency”. This was operationally defined by tests for bingeing, withdrawal, craving and cross-sensitization to amphetamine and alcohol. Source.

Which couldn't be further from the truth. There is no ""pure"" time in the past.   When you put it like that, yes, it sounds silly.  I would say that the paleo diet's fundamental assumption is that our bodies evolve or adapt slower than our diets change.  Whatever diets our bodies can ""handle"", those diets are closer to a modern diet minus carbs and sugars and much farther away from a modern diet that includes carbs and sugars.  The paleo diet probably does believe in a ""pure state"" (which I try to address below) but the assumption does aspire to science (rather than just some romantic notion of prehistoric man, although there probably is some of that), which is that our anatomies were mostly designed 200k years ago.  Carbs and sugars are such a modern addition that that may be what's causing the diseases we get in old age these days.     We always changed our food, our environment, and anything else to suit our desires we are just better at it now.   That's a good point.  IMHO, the paleo diet's main contention is to draw the line at the agricultural revolution, i.e. carbs.  From 200kya to 10kya, sure, we changed our environment continuously and such, but the changes in our diet were slow enough for our bodies to keep up.  But from 10kya to now, we got too good at changing our diets (basically, carbs), and our modern diets - though it tastes good - may have diverged too far away from what our bodies are designed for."

Unfortunately, grad school and academia don't often stress teaching, outreach to the public, etc., but instead focus on digging  so deep into a specific subfield that one forgets how to answer simple questions with easy-to-understand answers.    I'm sure I'm guilty of this too, but it's something I think we could all work on in this sub."
AskAnthropology,3c7j6n,welearntolive,6,Mon Jul 6 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a lay person when it comes to anthropology (my knowledge doesn't go much further than say, Discover and Popular Science and National Geographic type of publications), but I don't really sense much snobbery here.  I think a lot of it is simply that it's impossible to answer such a broad question in a format such as this, because the answer is going to be as broad as the question.  In other words, it'd take a book to tackle such a vague answer.  But another issue I think is specialization.  I frequent, and participate in /r/askhistorians a lot more than here, so I'll use a common enough type of question that gets asked there as an analogy for here.  So, someone there might ask ""What exactly was warfare like in medieval Europe?""  Well, on the surface to the layperson, that might seem like a good question that could easily be answered.  To someone more knowledgeable however, it's simply too broad a question that is asking for a simplistic breakdown of warfare for many different cultures over a fairly lengthy period of time.  There is no one answer.  There's not even a vague answer that could be reasonably be expected to given in such a format/medium as reddit.  Even those who study specific fields that fall under the general umbrella of ""medieval European warfare"" may only be comfortable answering for their more specific focus.  So when an expert says ""Well, you need to be more specific.  The A and B peoples of region Blah during time period used totally different technology, tactics, etc, than those peoples of region Whatchamacallit during the reign of King Kong III."", they aren't trying to show off, they're trying to highlight the inherent problem with the question.    And that leads me to another issue, and that is that part of learning is learning to ask the right questions.  Even subscribing to the notion that there are no stupid questions, one must learn that there are however some questions that are better than others.  But going back to the topic of specialization, is that experts from more specific subfields within a more general field may not be comfortable trying to answer outside their respective areas of expertise."
AskAnthropology,3c7j6n,eidetic,2,Sun Jul 5 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"And that leads me to another issue, and that is that part of learning is learning to ask the right questions. Even subscribing to the notion that there are no stupid questions, one must learn that there are however some questions that are better than others.   The tricky part here to me is that by raising the bar for the quality of questions, you're raising the bar for askers and participation in general.  Do we want to welcome questions and foster dialogue and discussion, or pretend that this is /r/AcademicAnthropology or /r/LinkToOurReadingListOfAnthropologyBooks?    My thing is, if you're knowledgeable enough in a topic, to demand a specific question is to demand a question that's actually easy to answer.  If I'm a master in field X and you ask me the most specific question ever in the field, it's easy for me to answer it for you: ""Yes"" ""No"" ""100k years ago in Eastern Africa.""  If you ask me a really broad question - as long as I'm a master in the field, I can answer it - it's just harder for me to answer because now I have to gather all my thoughts and summarize a huge topic, and my answer could be kind of long, too, if I choose to make it so.  (However, I think /u/Derpese_Simplex's top reply here is very adequate, since he explains exactly why the question is broad and gives specific examples.)  But it's by no means un-answerable.  And the moment I demand the asker to get more specific, I've asked him to change the question into something that it wasn't before.  And if it's a very uninformed asker, how does he even know how to ask a specific question?  The only answer then is to just tell him to read a book.  Then we should just change /r/AskAnthropology to /r/LinkToOurReadingList.  IMO, it's a phenomenon not just in /r/AskAnthropology but in all social science /r/Ask subreddits.  It can be quite fickle, though.  Sometimes the broadest question gets 100s of in depth answers from all the experts.  Other times, it's a derisive ""That question can't be answered,"" and the thread dies very quickly.  For example, if the first answer was a fairly long and comprehensive answer by an expert about different prehistoric human diets, it probably would've fostered a lot of great discussion and explanations afterward.  I'm not saying we should expect that kind of answer every time.  But, I would like to expect that people shouldn't want or applaud ""That question can't be answered"" -type answers too much.  Sometimes, it's less ""That question can't be answered"" and more ""I have a lot of expertise but I don't want to answer that question because it's too large.""  It's not that the question is bad, it's that it's hard.  IANAHistorian or anthropologist, but in my experience, questions on undergrad final exams in history courses were very often the broadest questions ever.  Again, it's not that I'm expecting people to answer these broad questions comprehensively every time they pop up.  But they don't need to be discouraged either.  Rather, someone could just give a very TL;DR version, maybe suggest a few books if the OP seems eager to learn, and then move on."

Other recent workers have focused instead on scavenging, or particular plant foods. Foraging theory suggests that inclusion of any food is influenced by its profitability and distribution within the consumer’s habitat. The morphology and likely cognitive abilities of Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, and early Homo suggest that while hunting and scavenging occurred, their profitability generally would have been considerably lower than in extant primates and/or modern human hunter-gatherers. On the other hand, early hominid diet modelers should not focus solely on plant foods, as this overlooks standard functional interpretations of the early hominid dentition, their remarkable demographic success, and the wide range of available food types within their likely day ranges. Any dietary model focusing too narrowly on any one food type or foraging strategy must be viewed with caution. We argue that early hominid diet can best be elucidated by consideration of their entire habitat-specific resource base, and by quantifying the potential profitability and abundance of likely available foods.  TL;DR: Probably anything they could get their hands on."

But humanity is nearly 200k years old -- sure, most of that has been as relatively egalitarian hunter gatherer groups, but that doesn't mean there was no war or power differentials between populations.    My point is this: he has a fascinating argument (I'm a huge supporter of the idea of ecology and geography shaping human behavior), but try to keep a broader perspective than just the one he lays out in the book.

He wrote an accessible book advancing the theory --with lots of easily digested examples and factual context-- that there is a geographic element to how civilizations evolve, advance, and cross-pollinate ideas and diseases. I know he isn't the first person to point it out, and I know in some of his later works he positions himself as a philosopher and an anthropologist rather than a well-traveled  ornithologist, but credit has to be given to him for making his thesis an accepted and required part of the conversation.

In the 90's anthropology went off the deep end in terms of arguing for the centrality of culture above all. This led to the ludicrous idea that environmental conditions play no role in cultural development. Because Diamond was arguing they do his book was widely panned.  It's fair today to argue about the degree and details of how past environment has shaped culture. It's pseudo-science nonsense to pretend it has played no role.

It seems that there are two broad criticisms: that geographical determinism isn't particularly novel nor a reliable theory; that it's kiiinda racist and glosses over a lot of non-European achievements. My background is scientific; all the same, I'm not convinced by a positivist approach to history. Acknowledging the technological differences between Europe and (for example) Mesoamerica isn't the same as explaining why one group decided to start enslaving the other.  If you focus in on individual concepts and passages, and the style of delivery in general, it's a readable and adequate assemblage of thought. It's just those thoughts are contentious. Perhaps its impact is a perfect storm of sorts - well-written but not accepted by the wider historical/anthropological community, of sufficient notoriety to be popular but not quite of sufficient quality to escape vigorous criticism.  I don't really have any great animosity towards Diamond's work, nor he himself, but I think a lot of the anger comes from the book's continuing popularity despite, what some consider, serious flaws that perpetuate the perceived Eurocentricism that dominates academic discourse.

Here's an excerpt of notes from my prof:   ""The Nuer also practice another unusual marriage form--Nuer Woman Marriage. A woman frequently marries another woman and becomes the father or pater--legal father (as opposed to the genitor, the man who impregnated the wife) of the children the wife bears. The female husband must have some cattle of her own to use for bridewealth payments to the lineage of the wife and is therefore married to her, just as a man would be. The female husband then gets a male kinsman or a friend or neighbour to impregnate the wife and to help with certain tasks around the homestead which the Nuer believe can be done only by men. Generally, a woman will do this if she has been unable to have children herself, and for this reason counts in some respects as a man. She is labelled a man metaphorically. In social life, she is defined a man: she may marry several wives if she is wealthy, she can demand damage payment if those wives engage in sexual activity without her consent, she is the pater of their children, and on the marriage of their daughters she receives the portion of the bridewealth that traditionally goes to the father, and her brothers and sisters receive those portions of the bridewealth that are supposed to go to the father's side. Her children are named after her, as though she were a man, and they address her as Father. She administers her compound and her herds as a male head of the household would, and she is treated by her wives and children with the same deference that they would show a male husband and father.  For the Nuer, a social man is not necessarily a biological man. If a woman does what a man does, she is a man. The presence of the appropriate genitalia is part of the prototype of a man, but it is not its sole defining feature. The role of husband and father is independent of the sex of the person carrying out the role."""

In their original form, these were long oral novels, fiction intended for adult audiences primarily for entertainment. Because of the often excessive violence and sexuality, children were generally excluded from the telling of these stories.  The fairytale is a literary adaptation of the folktale. It softened and shortened the folktale so that it could be published and read to children. The two forms - folktale and fairytale - are related, but they are distinct.  Folktales naturally reflect the society and culture in which they were told, but I would not feel comfortable saying that they were supposed to do anything other than entertain their audiences."
AskAnthropology,3c2w0v,itsallfolklore,4,Sat Jul 4 12:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well, don't forget they're good stories. :) And perhaps for some people, what makes a good story is the fantasy of riding off on a motorcycle and having a transgressive adventure.  Another thing to keep in mind: no culture is static or uniform. In early Russian folklore, all the stories involve male heroes who are punished for making independent decisions, and rewarded for following the advice of their wife/mother/talking animal/female nature spirit. Over time, this gets replaced by heroic male protagonists who invoke the Christian god, slay monsters with their own strength and guile, and have closer relationships with each other (there are often two brothers) than the women. The talking horses that used to do most of the work are now mute. Before the transition finishes completely, there are wonderfully ambiguous stories where neither paradigm is dominant. The brothers are brave, strong, good, God-praising, but their mother weeps and says ""you will never be my support."" They go forth and have many adventures, beating up witches and spirits and monsters. They get married to princesses and live happily ev— a monster reappears and eats both of them."
AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,groinbag,48,Fri Jul 3 08:32:48 2015 UTC,"I have two responses to this valid question:  Firstly, anthropology is a social science. This (to me at least) means that it is interested in forming and categorising knowledge. As such ""cultural relativism"" is not a moral position, but a practical academic one aimed at allowing the study of a given subject, in this instance characteristics of human culture. In the past few decades, anthropology has attempted to include a discussion of the role of the anthropologist as an individual in mediating the scholarly project. and as such the anthropologists' moral concerns have been discussed, but always in relation to their subjective experience of whatever it is that they are studying.  The second answer is utilitarian. Despite hundreds (or even thousands) of years of study, no academic discipline has yet worked what makes a culture function. If we attempt to study individual aspects of a culture in isolation of the others, we risk missing important data. Moreover, we risk making prescriptive statements about what should and should not exist. Given our lack of understanding, we might end up destroying a specific aspect of a culture or subculture vital to it's existence. This is not the job of anthropologists.  Finally there are issues of self-determination. This means that it is the responsability of the members of a society to change that society. I understand it's not that easy, and culture takes a long time to change. However, it weakens the strength of research performed by anthropologists when they attempt to detach themselves and make statements about what should and should not be. This does not prevent anthropologists from taking a moral stance on any given topic, but they do so as individuals and must provide a full disclosure as part of their academic practice, explaining their bias and attempting to analyse how it affects their study.  This is a topic that has been extensively covered in anthropologist litterature, and i've attempted to summarise what i recall as well as my personal position. I would love to be told what if i've missed anything out, or misunderstood any aspect."

I may have wrongly interpreted the OP's question as expressing some concern over what he believes is anthropologies advocacy of moral relativism as a meta-ethical stance.

How do you determine/measure that, i.e. what factors would lead you to conclude that a given (possibly hypothetical) culture does or doesn't function?

AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,orthocanna,3,Fri Jul 3 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't count stability as a metric. One of the defining features of human culture is that it changes and adapts over time (no ""stone age"" cultures in the present!). I would, however, consider the ability to self-replicate as a metric. Does the next generation identify with the previous one? Do they carry out any similar or related practices? Is there a general will to carry on the civilisational project? Are new generations born and educated?  There is one theory about Easter Island that proposes that after the centuries of isolation, European explorers arriving may have completely shattered the native cosmology. Across the sea, were meant to live only the ancestors and the arrival of  ships full of what were decidedly not ancestors may have been too much. After this point, the moai were all toppled and buried and the island was in complete disarray. I'm sure that proponents of the competing theories might dispute the factual accuracy of this theory, but i think it illustrates well the kind of small change that can lead to far reaching cultural dislocation."
AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,Snugglerific,3,Sat Jul 4 16:26:13 2015 UTC,It's important not to conflate cultural relativism with moral relativism. Cultural relativism is a methodological instrument. The basic idea is to study a culture on its own terms. Moral judgments are separate from cultural relativism. Here's a brief article that gives a basic overview:  http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v11n1/relativism.html
AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,JKadsderehu,8,Sat Jul 4 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"Napoleon Chagnon talks in his edge.org interview about his many years spent living with the Yanomami tribes people, and one of the things he said is that they occasionally practice infanticide, particularly in cases where a man thinks he has been cuckolded and the child isn't his. Now, being a good descriptive scientist Chagnon wrote about this in his scholarly work, but it became politically contentious: Some politicians in I think Venezuela where they were wanted to have these people arrested for murder. After that he says he stopped writing about this.  It is tricky, because good science practice is that we should study a culture without changing it, but there are some cases in which another culture is doing something that by our standards is so morally abhorrent that we feel we should do something about it.  However, scientists generally feel that it isn't their place to do so. They are describing cultural practices, not advocating for them.    This is the interview if anyone is interested.  It's about 2 hours long but well worth it."
AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,MandarinOtter,3,Fri Jul 3 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"being a good descriptive scientist Chagnon wrote about this   Lol no. Chagnon's research method was horribly unethical and did tremendous harm to the Yanomami people. He intentionally provoked conflict among the Yanomani to ""prove"" that male violence was biologically intrinsic, which then justified further violence among/onto the Yanomani peoples.   Good and other Yanomami specialists make it clear that the supreme accolade of Yanomami personhood--the term waiteri that Chagnon translates as ""fierce people""--involves a subtle combination of valor, humor and generosity. All of these, moreover, are reciprocal relations. One should return blow for blow, and Chagnon is hardly the only male anthropologist to get into dust-ups with Yanomami warriors. But according to his own account, while Chagnon readily joined the negative game of holding one's ground, he knowingly brought contempt on himself by refusing to be generous with food. Continuous food-sharing is a basic criterion of humanity for Yanomami, the material foundation of their sociality.  Needing blood and information quickly, Chagnon would announce his visits to a village in the guise of a Yanomami warrior: dressed only in loincloth, body painted red, feathered--and carrying a shotgun. His field kits have been known to contain chemical mace and an electric stun gun. He tried to cultivate a reputation for dangerous magical power by engaging in narcotic shamanistic seances. When someone stole from him, he got children to inform on the thief; then he returned the favor by carrying off the latter's hammock until he got his stuff back. But when it came to the reciprocity of food sharing, he protested that he could not feed the whole village. On the contrary, he disgusted curious Yanomami by telling them the canned frankfurters he was eating were animal penises, and peanut butter likewise was just what it looked like. Unselfconsciously, he acknowledges that his unwillingness to share food generously or widely made him ""despicable in their eyes.""  ""The next morning,"" he writes, ""I began the delicate task of identifying everyone by name and numbering them with indelible ink to make sure that everyone had only one name and identity."" Chagnon inscribed these indelible identification numbers on people's arms--barely 20 years after World War II.  But he indeed had a delicate problem. He badly needed to know the people's names and their genealogies. This information was indispensable to the AEC biological studies. He was also engaged in an absurdist anthropological project, which he took seriously, of finding ancestor-based lineage institutions among a people who by taboo could not know, could not trace and could not name their ancestors--or for that matter, could not bear to hear their own names. To utter people's names in their presence is the gravest offense, a horror: ""In battle they shout out the name because they are enemies."" As for the dead, they are completely excluded from Yanomami society, ritually as well as verbally, as a necessary condition of the continued existence of the living. But for the sake of science, Chagnon had to know--and so set in motion an opposition between their humanity and his epistemology that developed progressively through his professorial career.  Chagnon invented draconian devices for getting around the name taboos. He exploited animosities within the village to induce some people to tell on others. He ""bribed"" (his quotation marks) children to disclose names when their elders were not around. Most productive of all, he went to enemy villages to get people's genealogies, and then confirmed the information by seeing if they got angry when he recited the names to their faces. By the early 1970s Chagnon had collected some 10,000 Yanomami names, including 7,000 names of the dead. It must have caused a lot of pain and hate.

AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,ehead,2,Sat Jul 4 06:06:08 2015 UTC,"I'm about half way through ""Cultural and Social Anthropology - A Very Short Introduction"", and the author seemed to be advocating for moral relativism. Interestingly, he used the example of FGM, claiming that when viewed in it's cultural context the practice serves the function of initiating girls into adulthood (thus challenging your assumption that it is ""objectively"" terrible).  I get the impression it's bad form in anthropology to express too strong an opinion about the cultural or moral practices of other groups. This makes sense. The mere existence of so many different cultural/moral traditions casts doubt on the idea of moral realism.   Also, from a methodological perspective there is no real reason to express ones attitudes about other cultural and moral traditions. Biologists don't need to comment on the instincts and behavior of animal species in order to accomplish their work.  It may simply be asking too much of anthropology to have an entirely coherent view on the matter when even philosophers appear to be confounded."

AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,martong93,2,Fri Jul 3 17:08:54 2015 UTC,But what would affect the survival of the species? Do anthropologists get to speak out about global warming in particular?
AskAnthropology,3bz0y0,rbaltimore,2,Sat Jul 4 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, it's the little things, and often, it's more about the survival of that particular cultural group. If a particular practice had an impact on multiple individuals before reproduction took place (like girls dying of infection after female circumcision), then that could lead to a smaller gene pool for the group, resulting in one or more genetic disorders that could lead to more genetic bottlenecking (X-linked disorders that resulted in high rates of stillbirths of male infants, or deaths at birth, infancy or early childhood of males) or just flat out wipe out the group in a few generations (inherited blood disorders like hemophilia and porphyria are good examples, you can see what they did to the royalty of Europe in the last 200 or so years as a good example, and Saudi royalty and nobility are really struggling with this right now, a hospital local to me built an entirely new wing just to facilitate treatment of international patients, Arab in particular). (In addition, I am focusing on reproductive patterns only. There are a host of other ways a cultural practice can be detrimental. I became a psychotherapist after getting my anth degree, so there are psychological repercussions too, the genetic ones are just easier to see).  Because cultural groups differ so greatly, and many intermingle, I was off-base to state that one cultural practice could wipe out our entire species, even by increasing genetic bottlenecking events. But it is maladaptive to any cultural group to have cultural practices that affect the group in detrimental ways. A really good example right now is Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints. Much of my social anthropological training (and my minor in Comparative Religions) tells me to always try to exercise cultural relativism when looking at religious groups, even fundamentalist ones. My undergrad advisor specialized in New Religious Movements (NRMs), or what the public calls cults. They really aren't the horrible groups they are painted as being.  Usually. FLDS is an exception. Even if you take away the rampant oppression and abuse of women, if you use cultural relativism and say ""Well, it's cruel, but we have to respect how they do things"" (which I do NOT agree with), they are currently hamstringing themselves with their marriage/reproduction practices. One male is fathering children with a dozen women or more. That really restricts genetic heterogeny within the group. Despite being a male dominated  society, young males are actually being cast out of the group because their taking of wives threatens the wife taking practices of elder church males. That's another hit for heterogeny. Both of these practices lead to elder church males taking wives who are cousins, nieces, and cousins/nieces who are related to both the husband on both sides of the family and/or (usually and) are related to them through multiple lineages. This has led to situations where women are both daughters of their mothers and their mother's grandmothers due to marriage arrangements.  Because the US is NOT supportive of these practices and tries to intervene, the FLDS has essentially become a closed society existing within the larger US society. There are almost no new members, and those that do join come from related groups where there are the same reproductive patterns. If you want to see a culture destroy itself in your lifetime, go visit the FLDS graveyard for stillbirths, infants, and children. I have seen photos and videos, and it is heart wrenching to see. That graveyard is enormous, and the fact that they have need for such a graveyard speaks for itself. At some point, they stopped naming/marking the names of their dead children.  So even if you were a dispassionate cultural relativist, unable to be moved when cultural practices brutally harm the lives of individual people, violating the social code that crosses all human cultures, that somehow became standard for all or most of humanity, you cannot deny that some or many of these practices are detrimental or even wholly destructive to the group.  tl;dr - stating that cultural practices can be detrimental to the species as a whole was stretching it quite a bit. But these cultural practices can violate behavioral standards that appear to be universal to humans, and even if you are so relativistic that you argue with that idea, these cultural practices can be detrimental or even wholly destructive to the whole group."

For example, in his chapter in the book, Tom Boellstorff argues that we should distinguish between heteronormativity and homophobia, where the latter is violence and hate against homosexuals.  In his chapter Boellstorff makes the case that while Indonesia may have historically been heteronormative, it's only recently become homophobic.

Generally, we perceive people as being a member of a tightly confined box: Homosexual or heterosexual primarily, followed by bisexuals. These labels are considered identities, and in recent years other more niche labels like ""demihomosexual"", ""heteroromantic"", or ""sapiosexual"" have become more prominent. Non-heterosexual people are perceived as a distinct social class, and for the most part, people who have sex with their same gender are not expected to partake in incidental heterosexual activity.  This really wasn't how Western societies perceived same-sex activity before the 19th century. Italian plays like the Marescalco make it clear that 15th-century Italians were very accepting of certain same-sex relationships, if the person being penetrated was a teenager. The Ancient Greeks of course had a similar, more formal view of homosexuality. To medieval Scandinavians, the rape of men was an acceptable dominance practice, regularly used on enemies or criminals. In Muslim Spain, it seems that men were expected to be bisexual, and extant poetry suggests that it a relationship with a man was not exactly less moral than a relationship with a woman.   Some academics like Joseph Massad make the very bold claim that activities meant to promote LGBT tolerance in the Islamic world are actually intolerant, because they erase the traditional ""subtle bisexuality"" that was the norm in the Middle East and replace it with a Western binary, which he believes to be a form of imperialism."

Even going back to only a century ago, the majority of people would have an intellectual disability or close to it. Going farther back, IQ scores would indicate that people would literally be in vegetative states. So it is easy to rule out a continuous increase in innate mental ability. Flynn himself chalks it up to a few factors. Most importantly, IQ tests heavily measure certain abstract mental skills that are emphasized in Western education systems that have spread across the globe in the past century. Flynn also hypothesizes that there is a feedback effect where high-IQ individuals seek out more stimulating environments. He outlines this in a summary of one of his books here:   Naming the paradoxes  (1) The Factor Analysis Paradox:  Factor analysis shows a first principal component called ""g"" or general intelligence that seems to bind performance on the various WISC subtests together.  However, IQ gains over time show score gains on the WISC subtests occurring independently of one another.  How can intelligence be both one and many?  (2) The Intelligence Paradox:  If huge IQ gains are intelligence gains, why are we not stuck by the extraordinary subtlety of our children's conversation?  Why do we not have to make allowances for the limitations of our parents?  A difference of some 18 points in the average IQ over two generations ought to be highly visible.  (3) The Mental Retardation Paradox:  In 1900, the average IQ scored against current norms was somewhere between 50 and 70.  If IQ gains are in any sense real, we are driven to the absurd conclusion that a majority of our ancestors were mentally retarded.  (4) The Identical Twins Paradox: Twin studies show that genes dominate individual differences in IQ and that environmental effects are feeble.  IQ gains are so great as to signal the existence of environmental factors of enormous potency.  How can environment be both so feeble and so potent?  The solution in shorthand  (1) Solution to the Factor Analysis Paradox: The WISC subtests measure a variety of cognitive skills that are functionally independent and responsive to changes in social priorities over time.  The inter-correlations that engender ""g"" are binding only when comparing individuals within a static social context.  (2) Solution to the Intelligence Paradox: Asking whether IQ gains are intelligence gains is the wrong question because it implies all or nothing cognitive progress.  The 20th century has seen some cognitive skills make great gains, while others have been in the doldrums.  To assess cognitive trends, we must dissect ""intelligence"" into solving mathematical problems, interpreting the great works of literature, finding on-the-spot solutions, assimilating the scientific world view, critical acumen, and wisdom.  (3) Solution to the Mental Retardation Paradox: Our ancestors in 1900 were not mentally retarded.  Their intelligence was anchored in everyday reality.  We differ from them in that we can use abstractions and logic and the hypothetical to attack the formal problems that arise when science liberates thought from concrete referents.  Since 1950, we have become more ingenious in going beyond previously learned rules to solve problems on the spot.  (4) Solution to the Identical Twins Paradox: At a given time, genetic differences between individuals (within a cohort) are dominant but only because they have hitched powerful environmental factors to their star.  Trends over time (between cohorts) liberate environmental factors from the sway of genes and once unleashed, they can have a powerful cumulative effect.   http://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/about-us/directory/beyond-the-flynn-effect"

Although it's hard to determine this as these countries have mass immigration from third world countries. It still stands reasonable that the Flynn Effect has stopped and that IQs are decreasing.  Two reasons for the Flynn Effect are better nutrition (also why people are taller) and the fact that children are maturing sooner. The Flynn Effect, discovered by Richard Lynn, is a real paradox because it doesn't seem to be measuring anything real. For example SAT scores haven't really increased in the last 50 years.  http://www.amren.com/news/2008/01/a_possible_expl/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect#Possible_end_of_progression"

AskAnthropology,3bvn4d,ehead,7,Thu Jul 2 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Short answer: It's nonsense.  As you note, humans are an in-between species and there was a trend toward reduced sexual dimorphism. Additionally, there's going to be a large amount of variability when you're looking at a time period that extends over tens of thousands of years across multiple continents. It's possible that gendered division of labor did not arise until the Upper Paleolithic or Late Stone Age. So it's not really possible to make sweeping generalizations about patriarchies and/or matriarchies.  One of the key pieces of evidence supposed to support ancient matriarchy theories are the Venus figurines. Examples of these can be easily cherry-picked. There are a ton of problems with this. First, the figurines come from excavations covering tens of thousands of years. Second, not all of them are fertile-looking women. Many are men or of indeterminate gender. A number of them are also skinny. Third, they are found in a wide variety of contexts, including middens (i.e. trash), that don't suggest any single meaning attributed to them.  There are some claims made about later iconography found in the Neolithic, specifically Catalhoyuk in Turkey. Excavations in the 60s-70s found a very high quantity of female iconography. However, more recent excavations have found that this iconography was not as dominant as a great deal of animal and male iconography was discovered.

Since the causal picture of conception was confused this gave women more power.   This is the part that bugs me the most. Is there anything to suggest men didn't realize they were having kids when having sex? Seems unlikely, because AFAIK women didn't spontaneously have children back then (there was always a guy at play) and the whole ""sperm"" concept seems hard to miss..."
AskAnthropology,3bvn4d,CallMeJamarcus,5,Thu Jul 2 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"A group of indigenous Australians named the Tiwi believe that women become pregnant as a natural part of the life cycle, and that procreation is not necessary to create a child. Men still marry women because they believe that children should have parents to be raised successfully, but the basic principle that men and women are unaware of their role in procreation has existed historically."

AskAnthropology,3bvn4d,Vladith,0,Fri Jul 3 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like something analogous to the notion of parentage must be pretty ancient, particularly for a pair bonding species. Animals need to have some sort of instinct for who are their offspring so they won't spend a lot of time trying to secure resources for non-kin. In any species where the males help ""provide"" these sort of intuitions would emerge in males. It seems like these intuitions alone, even in the absence of a full blown theory around conception, would be enough to boot strap some of the negative domineering behaviors that would eventually become patriarchy.  But, I agree, it seems like observation of who is having sex with whom, and who isn't having sex would be enough to put 2 and 2 together.  Surely some anthropologists have studied this?

You might recall narratives about how ""mom always has the last word in a matter"", and that's exactly what inward power is.  The man has the outward power, that means he is the representative of the family, he is the one that would go to chief of the tribe to discuss a matter that impacts his family.

We often forget just how abstract words like power and patriarchy are and fail to properly unpack them and think about them. Inevitably doing so reveals much more variety and subtlety than was first apparent.  So, anyway, I think you are right to assume that ""power"" operates on many scales between many participants... within siblings, children in general, parents to child, between a mating couple, within the family. Then there is probably local power that comes into play within hunting parties, gathering parties, witchcraft/spiritual ceremonies, councils of elders, etc...  It may be much more fractured than the word ""patriarchy"" or ""matriarchy"" implies. Indeed, maybe that's precisely what these feminist theorists are suggesting, that power was more decentralized. If so, matriarchy probably isn't the best word for it."
AskAnthropology,3bvn4d,Mr-Yellow,0,Fri Jul 3 11:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess there has probably always been some sharing of power and authority.

What i can tell you is that it's never a good idea to rely on any single source of information on such a complex topic, especially from intro to sociology lectures. There is no good evidence for matriarchy recorded or observed in any society, simple societies tended to be egalitarian and matrilineal. I'm only aware that animism seem to be the most primitive of spiritual believes, so I'm not sure where they got the information on fertility goddesses, males of tournament species did not evolve to and rarely dominate and control females, but compete against other males."

AskAnthropology,3bvn4d,takeyouraxeandhack,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"So yeah, that brings up the question of just how much variation there was in early human societies? I guess another way of putting it is how much did biology constrain the possibilities. I mean, even chimpanzees have enough psychological and cognitive fluidity to develop different ""cultures""... the bonobos and the ""regular"" chimps. It's possible biology and the ancestral environment made it more likely for early humans to develop one system or another I suppose, or it may be the case that there was a great deal of pluralism in family/tribal relations even among early humans, so some groups were matriarchal, some patriarchal, and maybe some were gender neutral and power and decision making was based on merit, age, or whatever.   I have no real data to back this up, but my intuition tells me that something like patriarchy probably existed as a continuous thread from the common ancestors of chimps and humans all the way down to the present day. That's not to say that matriarchal systems might not have existed as well in certain populations.  It's not hard for me to believe that physical power wasn't levered into political power. Where it wasn't there must have developed some strong retraining cultural practices... cultural practices which I bet were fragile.  I may need to read more about what patriarchy is. For the purpose of the above I mean something like the following... when a group of early humans was deciding whether to cross the river or not, to stay put or take a trek to the sea, to make war on their neighbors, to decide a dispute, etc... that women's input was systematically devalued and that men's input was usually the deciding factor."
AskAnthropology,3bvwe5,ethereal77,8,Thu Jul 2 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ah the old Goddess Movement and Kurgan hypothesis.   This is opening up a can of worms, so I'll dive right in.    Are goddess/venus/female figurines evidence of an ancient matriarchy?   Nearly impossible to tell from the archaeology alone, but there are some thoughts and theories. Remember this however, many pestles found all across the world are shaped like penises. Does that immediately make a culture patriarchal?    If not, what is their purpose and what insight do they give us into ancient societies?   Again, very difficult to tell but it is probably safe to say that they were representative of a fertility goddess, due to the exaggerated sexual organs, that pre-indo-european speaking peoples of europe  believed in.    Are there any ancient matriarchies?   Difficult to say for sure but probably not.  Basically the stuff that you're talking about here is a part of second wave feminism called the Goddess movement, which makes the claim that many, some people claim all, prehistoric cultures started with a female goddess and matriarchal system which eventually switched to patriarchy, after war or assimilation or what have you, as the technology and food system changed.   The problem with these hypotheses is that they don't have very much concrete science to back them up and rely somewhat on a leap of faith. To give you an example, if we didn't have writing and oral traditions to show otherwise, an archaeologist digging up an old catholic church might very well assume that Catholocism is matriarchal religion due to the number of Virgin Mary figures unearthed. Just because a religion has female gods does not mean that a female god was the head deity. High status of a female god, does not mean high status of real women, take a look at ancient Athens.  As to your final question about matriarchies ever existing in the ancient world, the very unsatisfying answer is that we don't know for certain but probably not. The ""probably not"" part comes mostly from what we know about how each sex goes about trading resources for intercourse, social control, and inheritance in surviving hunter gather cultures, pastoral nomads, horticulturalists, and larger civilizations.   You may also want to check out the (Kurgan Hypothesis)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_hypothesis] and a book called 9The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World)[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8488.html] by David W. Anthony, in addition to your reading specifically on the venus figurines.   This is a pretty controversial subject, and control over the ancient mythology of europe has had very serious consequences outside of feminism and academic debates (the nazis for one got the idea of the aryan race from this subject).

Evaporative Cooling: The majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Sweating vs. Panting: Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on sweating, to dissipate heat. Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Human Advantages: Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair.[5] By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,RowYourUpboat,6,Wed Jul 1 06:12:48 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that you don't have to invoke the persistence hunting hypothesis to explain our hairlessness as an adaptation for efficient heat loss. Humans are unique amongst apes in relying on sweating for thermo-regulation – and obviously that would be a hell of a lot less effective if we were still covered in hair.
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,brigantus,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"But if a lack of fur was a beneficial adaptation in certain kinds of mammals, why do humans seem to be the only prominent example? Hairlessness can even be artificially selected for (for example, in cats) but it seems very rare in nature.  I suppose it is possible that only hominids occupied an ecological niche where lack of fur was wholly beneficial. There is also the possibility that the eventual development of clothing prevented the human lack of body hair from being selected against later in evolutionary history (such as during climate changes and migrations)."

One hypothesis is we started out as scavengers that eventually or perhaps concurrently started hunting. Our ancestor's ability to use tools allowed them to access meat on carcasses that other scavengers and predators could not obtain. Having hands and being able to walk on two feet is beneficial for tool use.  There are a lot of factors that made us us, if you add them all up you get modern humans. The sweating and complete bipedalism could have been selected for later after we already started using two of our feet to manipulate our environment. Look at monkeys or chimps, their hands are almost hybrid hand/feet since they use them to walk sometimes and other times they use them to manipulate their environment."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,antisyzygy,-7,Wed Jul 1 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"sushi or beef tataki   These are highly processed foods.  Can you pick up a fish, like a bear does, and eat it?  I think you would choke to death trying."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,Leontiev,6,Wed Jul 1 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can eat a fish raw with just your hands and teeth. You might avoid certain really bony fishes, and have to hit your fish against a rock first, but your stomach can digest raw meat is the point. Cooking is beneficial but not required. Whether I could actually stomach a pile of raw crunched up meat and bone is another matter, but keep in mind we were all raised in a society that cooks the meat we eat so we aren't used to it.   Our ancestors have had tools since very early on. It's not unreasonable to assume they could use tools and eat raw meat, just like Chimps do. Heck, you need tools first in order to make fire reliably so I'd argue tools and weapons came first, and cooking came later.  Tools were used as far in the past as 3.3 million years ago.  The oldest evidence for cooking was dated to about 1 million years ago.  Homo Erectus was around 1.9 million years ago and stuck around till about 70,000 years ago."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,antisyzygy,-6,Wed Jul 1 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"This kinda got off track.  We began talking about persistence hunting, the running down of animals.  I don't think anybody was running down fish, although that makes an interesting image.  Let's get back to the point.  Without tools and fire, how can you eat an animal that you have run to exhaustion?  My point is that evolution is very slow and tools and fire came in very late in the game.  Our physical makeup - teeth, jaws, hands, etc. were in place long before that and they do not appear to be adequate to eat an animal such as an antelope or gnu without culturally developed processing.  My point being that I don't think the persistence hunting hypothesis really works because of these time factors."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,Leontiev,3,Wed Jul 1 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the scavenger hypothesis is that we had very primitive tools (like naturally occurring rocks) and used them to scavenge meat from carcasses.   For example, there is some evidence our ancestors used rocks to smash open bones to get at the marrow other animals can't get at. Hyenas are to my knowledge the best at doing this on their own due to their impressive jaw strength and layout, but that article I linked to originally was saying Hyenas were not widespread at the point of early hominid evolution. They have found bones that look like they were chipped away at by rocks near other evidence that shows hominids were around.  So you have our ancient ancestors scavenging meat from carcasses probably, which is selecting for tool use. Over time our hands became more specialized and eventually were no longer used for locomotion. At that point I think exhaustion hunting would come into play and select for the other features we're talking about, like lack of hair and more active sweat glands.  Here's an article about how they think Australopithecus garhi may have used stone tools around ~2.5 million years ago. That species would still be quite hairy, but I am not sure what sort of sweat glands they had."
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,antisyzygy,-2,Wed Jul 1 20:03:53 2015 UTC,These are just guesses and do not speak to the immense period of time it took for our particular body to evolve in to it's current form.  I thought there might be someone here that had some concrete knowledge on this.  But thanks for the time.
AskAnthropology,3bp7l1,Leontiev,3,Thu Jul 2 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"We're talking 2.5 million years here, which covers our probable earliest partially-tree-dwelling-hairy-ape-looking hominid ancestors Australopithecus Garhi to the evolution and spread of Homo Erectus. Homo Sapiens have been around about 300,000 years or so. There was ample time for us to evolve in this period, obviously, because it actually happened in that time frame.  The peer reviewed scientific article about the ""scavenger hypothesis"" I linked to earlier is here, again.   With the other information available from the OP you were originally responding to, I don't see how it doesn't answer your question. First came tool use, later came hairlessness and exhaustion hunting.  Tool use may have selected for specialized hands similar to what we have now that weren't used for locomotion. After that, our ancestors are bipeds that now have other selective pressure or ecological niches to exploit. Some of those early tool users started running down prey and eventually lost their hair and developed better sweat glands suited to this style of predation.  We can eat raw meat, so could our early ancestors. Cooking isn't required for tool use, scavenging, or exhaustion hunting. Tool use helps us kill things as well as process meat. For example, we can cut palatable chunks out of a corpse or access bone marrow in locations a big cat jaw is too weak to crack.   If the scavenger hypothesis is true, at some point we started using tools for processing meat from already-killed prey. Animals like big cats cannot get at all the meat on a corpse, but our tools could. Our tools can also become weapons to scare predators away from their recent kills. For example, we can throw big rocks at a cat that just took down a gazelle and scare it off. That doesn't preclude tool use for other things like what Chimpanzees use them for, e.g. getting insects and cracking nuts.  How much more do you need? The picture isn't complete, and there are alternative hypothesis like that Aquatic Ape one scientists seem to take with a grain of salt. This is just one theory that explains how we got here, and seems to match the evidence out there. All we have are fossils of early hominids, fossils of killed prey, and sites where tools were made to build the picture, we don't have genetic evidence usually to exactly pinpoint which species were our early ancestors.  If you don't buy it that is your right. There's nothing more to talk about, as you said. Thanks for your time as well, genuinely."

Perhaps it was the combination of body lice, group based grooming being replaced by pair bonding (and jealousy), more hunting/pursuit of prey requiring the greater shedding of heat (although desert/tropical predators retain fur), an omnivores dentition (our teeth are good for crushing grains as well as for shearing/chewing meat ... and with a greater dependence on meat, our bodies would get smeared with blood and greasy fat.

There is relatively little genetic variation between modern human populations. There is significant gene flow between these populations and any one population can produce viable offspring with any other. Race is a superficial concept that we don't consider in biology. Sure, there's some variation between populations, but it is no where near significant enough to be considered species differences.  It's also not true that we've only ever had one human species. Many different human species existed in the past. Most recent was H. neanderthalensis (Neanderthals), who went extinct about 40,000 years ago.  EDIT: Our species actually exhibits less genetic variation between populations than the average mammalian species."
AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,Coles13,12,Tue Jun 30 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"I have a question about this:   The plains zebra has six subspecies. For what I can discern, these subspecies are marked by geographical location and slight differences in appearance/living habits.   Why is it that zebras (and other animals) have subspecies that are perfectly viable with the main species and any other subs, but humans aren't categorized with subspecies? We have human populations better suited to certain environments and phenotypical differences. Would that make race in a subspecies context a valid argument?  Edit: Would this be better asked as a new post?"
AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,ThunderOrb,7,Tue Jun 30 19:04:24 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the phenotypical differences are actually very small, and genetically not very great, so all-in-all, the genetic variation within our species is in fact way smaller than many species.

AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,Dire88,2,Tue Jun 30 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the genetic differences between individuals within African populations are greater than the genetic differences between European and Asian populations.

In fact, we see a pattern of decreasing genetic diversity in populations as they move further from Africa. Pretty cool!

I'm going to leave the argument of dividing all the modern humans into subspecies for someone else. It'd be interesting to know if H. s. idaltu was more closely related to one population of modern humans than another.  Separate species, generally, can't reproduce to make viable offspring. There are cool problems with that theory, such as ring species, but a good place to start looking about whether disparate human populations have problems making fertile offspring. Ligers can be fertile, but were long thought to be infertile. I'd take that to mean that the infertility definition is actually a spectrum of fertility-infertility that comes from how distantly the mother and father's genome are from each other.  The fun of knowing that answer for biology in general could be calculating a ""sweet spot"" between incest and interspecies breeding for the healthiest offspring!"
AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,sinisterstarr,5,Tue Jun 30 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Separate species, generally, can't reproduce to make viable offspring.

All non-African people have some Neanderthal; all Tibetans have some Denisovan, etc. I know there's traces of other species of homo in other populations, but you get the idea.  I absolutely do not buy into the 'race realism' angle that the OP seems to be trying to find evidence for, but this part always confused me about humans - we clearly DID interbreed with other species, and the offspring clearly WERE viable, else we wouldn't exist now quite as we are. So were they (and us) all just subspecies of something else and not technically their own species, or what?  We're an incredibly messy genus."
AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,liah,2,Tue Jun 30 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"Because the term species is not clearly defined. Lions and Tigers are 'obviously' seperate species, yet they can mate. The moving apart of two different groups of one species will eventually make two species, but its not a digital transition, in Generation 465 they can still mate but in Generation 466 they cant, its a slow slow moving apart. So people need to accept that the concencus is that Neanderthals were one species and Homo Sapiens were another, but they were still close enough to mate. Species is an inherently wooly concept when looked at too closely."
AskAnthropology,3bn5ux,Thecna2,2,Tue Jun 30 23:15:17 2015 UTC,"First, the classic definition for a species is that two individuals of opposite sex can produce a fertile offspring. With most animals, like dogs, humans or llamas, this is not a bad definition. It gets very tricky with bacteria, fungi and some other instances with tricky reproductive methods.  This definition very obviously fits the human population, and has been informally tested multpile times (you know, people having kids that turn out to have kids themselves).  Concerning variability within the species, many interesting facts turn up when you start looking into this. F.ex. that genetic variation is greater within Africa than outside it. This means that Inuits, Australian aboriginese, saami people, fuegians and icelanders (basically, people from the different corners of the world) are more genetically similar than the the least similar people in Africa. This shows us, among other things, how deceiving it is to look at skin color, since it's an adaptation that seems to happen very quickly.  The human populations as a whole is also a lot less varied than many animal species living in nature, such as chimps, horses and the domesticated dog.  If you're interested, you could check out theories of bottlenecks in the evolution of our species, such as the Toba eruption, that seem to have killed loads of people and (possibly) greatly reducing variety within the population.  Tl;dr yes, we're one species. The differences are very slight and superficial, and can often be greater within groups than between them."

AskAnthropology,3bjxb6,Yelesa,4,Tue Jun 30 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"Filipino is an interesting suggestion, and I'll explain why, but almost certainly not the right answer to your question.  In many ways Filipino is a nationality, rather than an ethnicity, and only came to be associated with what the Americans and Spanish called 'indios' living in the Philippines as they (and the newly independent Philippine state) tried to reconcile political control of the entire archipelago at the turn of the 19th/20th centuries, by manufacturing a modern nation-state out of a group of disparate polities.  Most of the people living there at the time considered themselves to belong to distinct linguistic-ethnic groups such as Cebuano, Tagalog, Ilocano, etc. There were literally hundreds of these kind of groups living in the islands, and none really thought they had that much in common with each other. Indeed, inter-group warfare, slavery, piracy and so on was not uncommon even into the 20th century in some places. One of the racist policies of the Spanish and Americans was to rank these groups according to their level of 'civilisation', with the mountain-dwelling non-Christian tribal communities at the bottom, and the coastal-dwelling, most Christian population near the top, with an idea of educating the top races to become governors, either within the Spanish colonial regime, or as an American protectorate.  Those who came to be known as (and most readily adopted the name) 'Filipinos' were actually the pro-independence Tagalog-speaking elite living in Manila and southern Luzon (falling into the latter category of the racist hierarchy). This was partly because many were part of the Spanish colonial administration and had been educated in Spain, or influenced by Spanish culture in some way, where ideologies of nationality and identity were very important in informing ideas about how you can make a justifiable independent country. So the elite 'ilustrados' (as they were known), as part of the nationalist cause, began to talk more about 'Filipinos' as defining the inhabitants of the whole archipelago.  Even now, many will argue that the ideology of the 'Filipino' is controversial. It was ultimately vital in unifying a military movement against the Spanish and Japanese, and was also deployed to convince the Americans to leave the Philippines because a 'real' nation-state of 'ethnically homogenous' citizens had been established. However, the history of the 'Filipino' irons over differences between the ethnic minorities of the Philippine islands, and makes the interests of (often still richer) the Manila/southern Luzon, Christian, Tagalog-speaking population seem like the interests of the whole country. In some ways too it ideologically legitimises a legacy of oligarchical power that reaches back to the 19th century.  tl;dr 'Filipino' is a (national rather than ethnic) identity that has an interesting and provocative past, but I don't think is particularly new."

AskAnthropology,3bhxan,TittlesMcJizzum,13,Mon Jun 29 10:50:33 2015 UTC,I won't get into the issue of power so much but I can chip away a bit at the economic questions. There's certain relationships in wealth distribution and social structure that may be related to systems of production. Hunter gatherer societies and horticultural societies tend to have more equal wealth distribution and have evolved social institutions to maintain that more equal distribution. Agrarian and pastorialist cultures tend to be less equal. It's hard make these generalisations in all cases (the coast Salish for example were very unequal in terms of wealth distributions) but certain trends do stand out.   A major factor is institutions of property and how these institutions are developed by the culture. In the Salish example there are inheritable property rights to certain salmon streams. These are passed down from generation to generation and over time a marked disparity in wealth developed. In other cultures there is no concept of ownership for any part of the environment when it is in the environment. So if you plant some yams you would have no right to prevent someone else from harvesting them.   Another key issue is network effects. As societies grow in scale the number of control points in the network increases meaning a larger and larger set of institutions are required to regulate the functions of the society and it's social structure. This is one of the reasons why we see bureaucratic creep as a phenomenon in large networks.     So a large factor seems to be how institutions of property co-evolve with the resource base of a society and the scale of the society and it's social networks.

As group sizes increase hierarchy is necessarily introduced / increased to maintain cohesion and order. Put enough people together in a flat group and there will be pressure for the creation of leaders and subgroups, otherwise things will fall apart.   What shape that hierarchy takes will be more bound by culture, and also by environment and resources. Though even if the resulting system is highly egalitarian, it would still require hierarchy to be manageable.

And I wouldn't count the bonobos out by the way. They may not have male hierarchies, but there are absolutely power structures and hierarchies among the females. Younger females will deliberately seek out older, more powerful females, and initiate social and sexual relationships with them in order to build a close association, and with it, penetrate the hierarchy. This behavior, and the social structure it seeks to modify, is so critical to the species that the genital anatomy of the female bonobos has evolved to better facilitate female on female sexual contact. If that doesn't prove my point, I don't know what does."
AskAnthropology,3bkxjt,parduscat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"Your question seems to me to be a couple things rolled up into one.   Assumption - women pass on their genes more than men, have done for many thousand years, and the imbalance has been high continuously. (Not the most likely - I'll get to that in a minute) As a result, men have had certain traits selected for. (If we take 1. as true, this is a solid progression) Physical and mental traits can be selected for or against by mate selection.     Firstly, your assumption that the imbalance remains the same over time (allowing for more intense selection, theoretically, for males than females), seems unlikely. As far as I can tell (with a couple searches through an article database) there aren't many other studies supporting the continuity of reproductive imbalance. Even if reproduction was biased in favour of women, I doubt the 'seventeen to one' ratio was constant over time.  According to the abstract of the article cited, they hypothesize that the imbalance you note happened approximately 10 kya, not necessarily that it remained that way up until today.   But, for the sake of discussion, let's assume there was a constant imbalance for the last 10 kya in favour of women, so I can try to answer your question. I'm not sure how much you know about genetics, so forgive me if I over-explain.   The whole argument here is that some cultural change influenced how women choose men to have babies with. Okay, so how would they make these decisions? Completely based on phenotype (the outward expression of genes). Phenotype does not always reflect genes - for example, if you are heterozygous for a trait you will express the dominant allele but also have a recessive allele. (ex. A brown eyed women wants to have a brown eyed baby. So she picks a brown eyed man. Then surprise! They have a blue eyed baby! Unknown to them, they were both Bb, and their baby had a 25% chance of getting bb and being blue-eyed)  So women can only choose certain traits if they are visible (in the sense of 'able to be observed', not necessarily tangible). Physical traits, OK. High visibility for the most part (if I'm thinking correctly that you're not really talking about blood type, . Height, weight, etc. Also, probably mostly influenced by genes and, to a lesser extent, environment. But with the possibility of the dominant allele masking the recessive allele.   Mental traits, however, are much less visible. Not only that, but evidence suggests that the environment plays a larger role in mental traits (just an example; I was trying to find a study about children with schizophrenic parents - high 'genetic risk' -  brought up by non-schizophrenic and schizophrenic parents but wasn't able to find it). So even if women had actively chosen men with attractive mental traits, it doesn't necessarily mean that a) those traits were passed on and b) that the father wouldn't have undesireable mental traits not seen.   Finally, it's possible that women didn't choose men primarily by physical or mental traits, but rather for economic advantage, which would likely not provide a strong enough selection for any one physical or mental trait (again assuming high genetic heritability for mental traits) to change the population.    TL;DR The selection of mates by women was probably not focused or concerted enough to produce any change in physical or mental traits in the population. The essential difference is that the 'out-reproducing' of women to men reduced diversity in the Y chromosome.  Edit: Made it a little less messy"

AskAnthropology,3bf23x,ysadamsson,2,Mon Jun 29 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"As someone with ADHD, I'm not sure I'd call it an affliction. I don't this this fellow would either.  That said, I think it would be feasible that ADHD appears all around the world. I think the main difference is that in the modern world we're very sensitive to it: we give it a name, we medicate it, and we call it an affliction. In a setting where this kind of anxiety, ""attention-deficiency,"" hyperactivity can be an obstacle to one's goals, like taking tests, doing homework, and fitting into a steady job, it's certainly a difficult neurological difference.  But when the most responsibility you have is to do the things that keep you up and running, you have a forever to create things, to tell stories, to play, to learn an instrument or a song, to be creative and wild.  Which is why, someone correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of shamans are autistic, depressed, or in some other way not neuro-normative. They say that the shaman can heal or advise because he or she has a problem deep inside of them that they learn to overcome. They heal themselves of their affliction, and that gives them the power to heal others.  So, neurological differences and psychoses probably occur everywhere, but how they're treated and thought of changes. So in a sense, yes, they are culture-bound, at least in that by treating them differently perhaps they become a different form of the syndrome."

AskAnthropology,3bgegj,haby112,5,Mon Jun 29 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"It's a really good question, and the best answer I can give you is ""Maybe.""  Usually, megafaunal extinctions in the Americas are associated with the Clovis period, in which we have positive evidence of humans hunting mammoths, mastodons, and such.  However, some research has indicated that these megafauna were already in decline before the Clovis period.  That could mean that people were in the Americas hunting megafauna before Clovis technology developed.  There is some evidence suggesting this at sites like Manis, Washington; Hebior and Schaefer, Wisconsin; and maybe sites like Lovewell and Sena in Nebraska(?), if I remember right.  Of course, if you're a die-hard Clovis-first type who doesn't accept any of these sites, then the only option you're left with for the population decline is climate change.  In my mind, the changing climate and human predation may have acted as a double whammy to wipe out these species.  But it's important to remember that there are 36 to 38 species that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, and not all of them were megafauna, and not all of them were mammals.  Some people attribute these wider extinctions to a domino effect, in which the loss of one species brings about the loss of several others.  But I have only seen this scenario suggested, it's never been thoroughly demonstrated for terminal Pleistocene extinctions as far as I know.  If humans had not been involved, megafauna might have survived longer.  After all, we know that mammoths survived well into the Holocene on Wrangel Island due to their isolation.  But as to whether the megafauna could have made it to the present day without human intervention, your guess is as good as mine."
AskAnthropology,3bgegj,Telepathetic,2,Mon Jun 29 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear the answer to your last question is yes. The impact of human predation on the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinction is as close to fact as we often get in archaeology. The problem with the question is too often we search for simplistic single cause scenarios to explan the past.  We know the Late Pleistocne was a time of very significant environmental change in terms of both scale and speed not seen on the New World for a very long time. This included the conversion of huge portions of the continent from steppe-like environments to prairie and forested.  We know that it also corresponded with a large increase in human population, either as a first colonization or second (which is irrelevant in the model). The best explanation is that many species were severely stressed by environmental change and the introduction, or increase, in human predation was the fins triggering mechanism for extinction. It's likely that without humans some of the species would have survived."

We also know that mainland states knew about the islands,  so thinking their was some form of contact between the Andamanese and Indians or Burmese is a fair assumption. The TIL was  ridiculous in saying that the Sentinelese have been isolated from the rest of the world. Archaeological evidence of humans in the islands date back only a few thousand years. While this may not mean anything since sites could be washed away by flooding, there is no tangible proof that they have been there for 60000 years.    Also, I want to challenge your assumption represented by the word ""yet"" - you're implying that the invention of written language is bound to happen and that the Sentinelese have had a belated development. This isn't true. There is no Great Chain of Technologies that all cultures should follow, and writing was to my knowledge independently developed in only three places.

Urton, one of the folks responsible for Harvard's khipu database project, has been discussing this at symposia and in books for 15+ years. For example Narrative Threads and Signs of the Inka Khipu. I don't know what's been done, research-wise, in the last few years, but given the potential for complexity and how difficult it would be for us to tease this out with the relatively small number of extant pre-colonial khipu, it doesn't seem like it should be ruled out as a possible recording system."

The whole idea with the Great Chain of Being is that certain things are better, more desirable, and therefore a progression towards those things is inevitable. However, it's highly ethnocentric (the pinnacle of sociocultural development is - surprise surprise - being exactly like Europe)."

There's even been some speculation that the group that was there a hundred years ago has been replaced by another, though we don't have any real evidence one way or another. For all anyone knows, they could have only been there a couple centuries at most. Certainly not enough time for any sort of speciation.  All we know is that, for the recent past, those who have tried to contact them have been attached. However they're not actually uncontacted in the strictest sense."

AskAnthropology,3b9x0w,Ikhtilaf,2,Sat Jun 27 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Cultural anthropologist here. I'm sorry you're having trouble grasping Anderson, and that you're having trouble finding people here familiar with his work. It's been awhile since I read Imagined Communities, but here's the big picture about that book.   BA was interested in figuring out how it is possible for people who have never met each other to imagine themselves as part of a unified group called a nation. He attributes national consciousness historically to the rise of ""print capitalism."" (You've read it, so I won't recap this here any more.)  OK, so what does he say about time and religion in this argument, you ask? It's important to remember that, before print capitalism, the state was the monarch, the monarch was divine, and pretty much all script was sacred. Culturally, BA argues, this meant that in the conception of time itself there was no distinction between cosmology and history. Religion and the state were one, so the affairs of God were the affairs of man.  With the introduction of the novel and newspapers, time became split between cosmology and history. A secular sphere emerged distinct from religion. ""Homogeneous empty time"" corresponds to (secular) history, where disparate events of disparate actors (again, people who have never met) are understood as occurring simultaneously in time. Think of homogeneous empty time as simply the way a calendar represents time: every day is the same, 24 hours long, every day becomes weeks, months, and years, and we never run out of years. This is very different from a social world where a deity will make the final judgment at some point.  Not sure I've answered you, or recalled Anderson entirely correctly, but you seem to be juggling some weighty concepts in that thesis!"

""Homogeneous empty time"" corresponds to (secular) history, where disparate events of disparate actors (again, people who have never met) are understood as occurring simultaneously in time.    This is the part I haven't grasped clearly. What does exactly he mean by ""homogeneous""? Can it not be homogeneous, i.e., heterogeneous? And what does he mean by ""empty""? Can it be filled or even compressed?   Think of homogeneous empty time as simply the way a calendar represents time: every day is the same, 24 hours long, every day becomes weeks, months, and years, and we never run out of years. This is very different from a social world where a deity will make the final judgment at some point.   And this is another. Back then people also had religious calendar - it's one of Christianity's main concern, even, when people are most concerned on when a ceremonies like Easter should be observed and saints' feast should be celebrated. Except in Christianity's very early history, there was no plan on ""scheduling"" the end of the day in calendar. How would this different from today secular calendar?    Perhaps my question should've been, does simultaneousity (which, I think, agreeing with certain scholars such as Sarah Foot, is the core argument of Anderson's imagined community) necessarily require a homogeneous and empty time? Could the time still be imagined as not homogeneous and not empty in order to be imagined as simultaneous?"
AskAnthropology,3b9x0w,hardboiledjuice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"Homogeneous empty time is probably a concept Ben Anderson is borrowing from a hugely important essay by the cultural theorist Walter Benjamin, titled ""Theses on the Philosophy of History."" Essential to read the whole work, but here's a key excerpt:   Thesis 13: The idea of progress is inseparable from the idea of homogeneous empty time.  Thesis 14: The transformation of history does not occur in homogeneous empty time. It occurs in moments of immediacy (jetztzeit). It blasts particular moments of the present and past out of the linear sequence (and presumably the order of fate).  Thesis 15: Revolutions are necessarily experienced as rupturing the continuity of history.  Thesis 16: The present is not a transition between moments. Time originates and reaches a standstill in the experience of the present. Instead of an eternal past depicted as linear, we need a ruptural experience of particular moments which stand out. (This suggests an expressive relationship to temporal experience).    Also useful is Dipesh Chakrabarty, from his Provincializing Europe:   ...time is empty because it acts as a bottomless sack: any number of events can be put inside it; and it is homogeneous because it is not affected by any particular events; its existence is independent of such events and in a sense it exists prior to them. Events happen in time but time is not affected by them."

AskAnthropology,3b65uf,TheDudeness33,35,Fri Jun 26 07:57:09 2015 UTC,"There was an almost identical question asked a few weeks ago about zebras, and some of the same answers apply. Domestication is not an entirely top-down process driven by humans -- the animal species must be biologically prepared for it. Specifically, nearly all animal species that have been domesticated produce very low levels of cortisol in comparison to related species that have never been successfully domesticated (e.g., dogs>wolves, cats>wild cat species, guinea pigs>rats, horses>zebras). Cortisol is a stress hormone, and most animals with normal cortisol levels will be skittish, unpredictable, and potentially aggressive in human presence. Domestication involves selecting a species that contains a genetic mutation for low cortisol production. If that mutation is widespread (dogs, cats) the domestication process is very easy. In some circumstance the mutation is present among very few members of the species, but selective breeding is used to create a separate strain that is calm and predictable (for example, cows were breed from extremely aggressive aurochs and a tame strain of foxes was produced in the 20th century). In most species, the necessary gene does not exist anywhere in the population and the species cannot be domesticated (zebras, lions, etc.).  Here is an excellent paper that goes through the genetic details. Skip to the ""Neuroendocrine changes under domestication"" and ""Destabilizing selection as a possible accelerator of evolutionary transformation of domestic animals"" sections."
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,psychguy,3,Fri Jun 26 13:12:38 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good answer, although I'd point out that Dogs are direct descendents from Grey Wolves, Cats from various forms of Wild cats, and that Rats have been domesticated.  I'd also point out that while Cortisol production is an important part f the domestication process, it is not solely causal, and that its part of a wide range of changing hormones and alterations in the developmental pathways of domestic animals (e.g. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00042.x/abstract for a review)."
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,susscrofa,2,Sat Jun 27 08:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, genetics are complicated. We would like to think that there is a one-to-one relationship between traits and genes, but that is not the case. One of those most interesting things about the fox domestication experiments was that selecting for a tame demeanor also brought with it a huge number of other traits that we find in domesticated dogs, cats, guinea pigs, cows, etc., such as broken coat patterns (splotches, etc.). Theoretically, you could start by selecting for appearance and end up with a tame demeanor.  Domesticated and wild dogs/cats are recently descended, but clearly genetically distinct populations. Maybe rats was not a good choice of rodents."

AskAnthropology,3b65uf,susscrofa,2,Sat Jun 27 11:50:19 2015 UTC,"When I am teaching about this stuff (college professor/neuroscientist) there is one particular developmental issue that I get stuck on. Domestic dog behavior is easy to explain (lots of social behavior is descended from wolf behavior in some was, broken prey drives explain a lot of breed characteristics, etc.), but domestic cat behavior has some elements that are nonsensical. The main one is that wild cats are solitary as adults, but domestic cats clearly retain a loose pack/family relationship with humans and even have communications behaviors that do not have analogs in the relationships with other cats (cats do not meow to each other). I have heard the theory that cats are developmentally stuck at a kitten-like stage, but there is really no convincing evidence for this. This seems like it might be related to some of your research, so do you have any ideas?"
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,psychguy,3,Sat Jun 27 12:33:06 2015 UTC,"Cats are a real oddity in the domestic animal world. I specialize on morphology rather than behavior, but the two overlap a lot. In fact most of the theory behind domestic animal behavior (like the retention of juvenile traits into adulthood you mention - which I can disprove for morphology) was lifted from evolutionary biology concerned with growth and development of body size and shape. So I'm a  little skeptical of paedomorphic behavioral traits.   Regarding cats  - their behavior has some parallels with the wild - for example Lions have adopted group life as a response to the savanna, as do cheetahs occasionally.  I can see a situation where cats have had to adopt to early human urban environments (cat domestication is generally seen as later than urbanism - although jean Dennis Vigne has some potential domestic cats on early Cyprus - c9500BC), and that has meant putting up with each other and reduction of territorial instincts. Many domestic cats are not friendly with other cats - or only form familial attachments (except in certain circumstances like enforced group e.g. catteries, even then attachments are mostly fleeting).  Cat behavior towards humans is a not very well understood puzzle, it certainly does not attract the study dogs do. How and why the formed the, perhaps more mutalism, rather than straight forward domestic relationship with humans has not been explicitly explained. There's a couple of papers that touch on the subject (especially no.2) - 1 2 3 but it is not satisfactorily explained (and paper 3 is contentious - they cant tell sub-species apart)"

There's been little interest even with modern technology and the task would only be more daunting with stone or copper-age technology. It's hard and extremely dangerous to ever get a calf separated from the herd, and if you tried to pen them at the time they would have just barreled through any wooden barricade you put up.  You also have an issue where the bison don't like staying in one place year-round and instead like to migrate, making it hard for any sedentary society to keep them in place.  Finally just as there's very little desire today to domesticate them, there would have been even less back then for the hunter gatherer and early agriculturalist societies that would have lived on the plains.

She said bison are quite aggressive, particularly cows with calves at side. They can easily tear down cattle stocks and those horns are dangerous! I would imagine it was just easier to hunt them than to try to keep them as livestock. Also there were no horses in the Americas until after the Spanish conquest so it would have been quite difficult to manage a herd. Sheep and goats can be managed on foot with dogs but you really need horses to control cattle."
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,ellevt,0,Fri Jun 26 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"I think that too much is being made about genetics (the domestication gene) and too little on captive breeding and selection.  While some animals are notoriously aggressive, nevertheless they generally respond to man with some degree of domestic behavior. Bison have been tamed which is the first step towards permitting selective breeding of less aggressive individuals to form a domesticated variant. Many films use tame animals (Ben the grizzly being a famous one) and presumably early steps towards domestication began with tamed individuals. We've all seen tame Bisons being ridden in county fairs and rodeo shows.   The ancient Egyptians tamed and may have domesticated (or semi-domesticated) many species we only see as wild animals. The Giant Eland for example show either some domesticable behaviors (it can be more readily herded than most other wild antelopes) or those behaviors were introduced into the wild herds after centuries of selective breeding that produced them. The Mustang horse can be redomesticated from a feral state though if you didn't already think it was possible, you might not believe that it could be done once you began to try.  Cheetahs are another 'tameable'/semi-domesticated species used for hunting for centuries. Elephants too and so forth.   With hand rearing plus selecting for less aggression over a long period of time wolves became dogs. I think all life is malleable to some extent mainly through selective breeding...   Given enough time carp became goldfish and wild very aggressive Aurochs became dull cud chewing cattle. Llamas, Guanacos and to some extent the semi-domesticated Vicuna were domesticated but the difficulties in domesticating a Bison could not be overcome without the horse."
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,Wereflea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't find the ""Look at wild bisons and zebras.  They're totally unlike cows and domestic horses, so domesticating them is unfeasible"" argument very convincing.  That just completely assumes that wild pre-domesticated cows and horses were already amenable to domestication when in truth, there might have been conscious human attempts and efforts at domesticating them before recorded history.  Like a commenter said above, dogs came from wolves and domestic cats from wild cats.  The process started somewhere.  I guess the problem is that most domestication of super important domesticated animals happened way too early in history to be recorded.  But if such records were magically available, OP's question could become, ""Did Eurasians attempt to domesticate cows or did cows 'domesticate' Eurasians?  Why didn't Native Americans attempt to domesticate bison or bison not 'domesticate' Native Americans?""  For the ""bisons and zebra and undomesticable"" argument to be stronger, it needs to compare the domesticability of bisons vs. wild cows?, zebras vs. wild horses.  But if we don't have access to ""wild cows"" or ""wild horses,"" then that comparison can't be done."
AskAnthropology,3b65uf,dasheea,0,Wed Jul 1 06:40:57 2015 UTC,I agree but it seems that attitude of the animals being too aggressive is old lore in light of trained animals and people with wild pets. One thing for sure is that wild Aurochs were intensely aggressive (more so than any Spanish fighting bull) and like African Cape Buffalo in that way. Yet we have cattle and in India zebu cattle (humped) came from wild Gaur which is like a tropical Auroch (wild cow). Zebras? Wild horses and wild asses were any different than a zebra? People need to justify their research grants and paychecks or need something to write a paper on or a book and they over stress some aspect because that is their field of expertise. One book or paper does NOT close the discussion. I agree with you based on the idea that animals can be bred for temperament. That's the difference between a cocker spaniel and a pit bull isn't it?

Thanks for citing the link, I hadn't known about the experiment but liked reading about their success. In particular that certain traits developed like a curly tail etc. as they selected for tameness etc.  The wolf into domesticated dog is easiest to understand since the mutual benefit of cooperation in the hunt probably existed long before dog traits showed up among the wolves that stayed around humans as opportunistic scavengers. After that though the reasons for the domestication of certain species is less obvious excepting that cats hung around humans because we attract vermin ...lol. Voluntary domestication or rather purposeful domestication seems related to food animals. Poultry lay eggs and grow to maturity fast etc. Pigs have large litters, sheep and goats are edible and give milk but why the horse? I think the horse is harder to explain lol"

AskAnthropology,3b7gt5,NotAgainAga,3,Sat Jun 27 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"Brazil is an interesting case. Brazil has a much larger Afro-descent population than the USA, because most of the slaves who were transported across the Atlantic were sent there. There were also different rules about who was a slave and how they could gain freedom, and a higher level of miscegenation than in the US, and hence somewhat less of an idea that Afro-descent=slavery. In the 20th Century, the country also adopted the official ideology of ""racial democracy"" which stood in stark contrast to the USA's segregation under Jim Crow. Nonetheless, there is a strong critique of the idea of Brazil ""racial democracy"" that says that while it that may the official ideology, when you compare the actual experiences of relatively lighter and darker skin people in the country a wide gap emerges. Anthropologists have even noted that within families lighter and darker skinned offspring are treated differently. This suggests that while state-sponsored racism has been less of a issue in Brazil than in the US, structurally racism is still a serious problem in the country.  To answer the OP's larger question, the historical conditions and distribution of wealth and power structure racism differently in different countries."

AskAnthropology,3azrxx,vertexoflife,37,Wed Jun 24 20:36:51 2015 UTC,"There's a number of elements that have to be teased out here. Firstly we have to look at the differences in the context of their fieldwork. Mead did her fieldwork in a fairly isolated corner of Samoa in the 1920s. As a young woman, she had better access to informants who were also young woman. Freeman worked in Samoa at various points beginning in the 1940s. Freeman worked in a different area and was generally more connected with chiefs and higher-ups. This time difference is also important because of increasing US influence and conversion to Christianity.  The work of either is not considered entirely discredited, even by their respective opponents. So we have to separate out to some degree this fieldwork from the accusations made against Mead by Freeman.  Now to get to the reactions to Freeman. The initial reactions and the ones that continued on throughout the 1980s were largely dismissive of Freeman. However, the most interesting critiques were probably by those who critiqued both Mead and Freeman. Some of the broad brush accusations made against Mead had some truth to them. Eleanor Leacock agreed that Mead had romanticized Samoa to some extent, but not to the extent that Freeman claimed. Bradd Shore believed the overall picture was somewhere between Mead and Freeman.  However, Shore, Leacock and others (I am also drawing on recent histories by James Cote, Paul Shankman, and Martin Orans here) demonstrate both that Freeman systematically misrepresented Mead on many points and had a number of inconsistencies in his accusations. For example, some of Freeman's own work -- statistics and interviews -- contradicted his own claims.  The biggest misrepresentation, though, is Freeman's later claim that Mead was ""hoaxed"" by an informant. Freeman misrepresented this informant as being key to Mead's fieldwork and conclusion about sexual activity. This was not true -- Mead devoted only a few sentences to her in Coming of Age. The interview which the hoax claim was derived from was dubious in a number of ways. The interviewee was with a relative of the chief and a higher-up in the Samoan government. Admitting to pre-marital sexual relations was taboo in this context. By the 1980s, many Samoans considered pre-Christian social practices (esp. pre-marital sex) to be a sort of dark age period and mentioning them was dishonorable. The manuscripts of unpublished interviews show inconsistencies in the informant's testimony as well. Recent histories of the controversies all consider this hoaxing idea to be entirely discredited. Even Orans, whose Not Even Wrong was a huge criticism of Mead, was at pains to show that the hoax hypothesis was false. Cote, Shankman, and Orans are unanimous on the fact that Freeman distorted Mead's work.  Also, Freeman like to portray himself as a level-headed scientist fighting against lunatic ideologues. Freeman himself was however not purely calm and rational during this controversy. He bullied his opponents, even trying to have some of their doctorates revoked.

This is definitely true. Shankman has a chapter on this explaining how the book got picked up by the sexual liberation movement and Freeman's book played into the backlash against this in the 80s. The book was placed on a number of ""Worst Books"" lists along with stuff like The Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf.  Freeman played into the straw (wo)man-ing of Mead in a more abstract sense. He railed against the ""Mead paradigm,"" which, if there really was such a thing, would be more accurately assigned to Boas. Both of them were labeled cultural determinists. This is kind of ironic because the model of culture, even the concept of culture itself, that many Boasians relied on were being heavily criticized in the 1980s from other quarters."

AskAnthropology,3ayabu,themodredditneeds,3,Wed Jun 24 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"The idea of modes is complicated within Western culture, and it is clear that minor mode is not connected to sadness in much of its past.  My post may not be relevant to Anthropology, per se, but it amounts to answering your question by surveying a portion of musicians within Western culture itself, before ""minor mode"" existed.  Minor/major modes are a relevantly recent development in the Western world.  There were twelve modes being used in Western music until the Baroque period (17th Century).    According to Anne Smith in ""The Performance of 16th-Century Music,"" the twelve modes were each associated with conveying a wide variety of emotions.  Many theorists from the period, who she cites, wrote about the modes, revealing a wide variety of ways each mode was heard.  For example, the ""minor mode"" we use today was known as the ""Aeolian mode"" at the time.  16th-Century author Nucius calls it, ""pure, mild, and wonderfully suave,"" while Zarlino says, ""it possesses a pleasant severity, mixed with a certain cheerfulness and soft sweetness.""  These are nuanced and conflicting descriptions of ""minor mode"" other than ""sadness.""    The Dorian mode would also sound like a ""minor mode"" to us today.  But in the 16th Century, there were many different opinions on how it sounded.  Gauffurius called it ""serious;"" Vaneus called it ""cheerful;"" Vicentino ""agreeable and devout;"" Tallis ""meek;"" Herbst ""cheerful, gay, joyful and majestic;"" Glaureanus states, ""The Dorian contains a certain majesty and dignity.""    The only modes described as ""sad"" by any author are Hypolydian, Hypophrygian, and Hypodorian.  But this author, Pontio, says that any other mode may be used to describe happiness.  The ""major mode"" of today was called the ""Ionian mode.""  The authors of the 16th Century agree with the ancient writer Horace that ""it pleases the mature virgin to be taught the Ionian movements.""  That is, it was considered best when used for dancing.  Nucius of the 16th Cenutry called it ""pleasant"" and ""lascivious.""  So it was not ""happy"" in general, but evoked a specific kind of carefree mood.  For Vanneus, the Lydian mode was ""jocund, moderate, and delightful.""  But for Nucius, it ""calls the knight to arms to do battle... it is threatening and severe.""  Mixolydian, another ""major-sounding"" mode, conveyed both ""excitement and continence.""  Or it was ""harsh and severe;"" or  ""cheerful and haughty;"" or ""bright and agreeable.""  And for the other modes there were likewise very nuanced and conflicting descriptions, covering the spectrum of emotions.  If you think about it, music still conveys this full spectrum of emotions to us today, with only two modes - and they don't always amount to simply ""happy"" and ""sad.""  Ethnomusicology compares world musics.  The most that can be said is, from what I understand, that all cultures sing in similar intervals (minor third, perfect fourth, etc...).  The tuning is not always the same, but it does amount to a similar melodic language based on mathematical ratios of the octave.  The West's system and evolution of modes, however, is unique to its highly sophisticated musical history."
AskAnthropology,3ayabu,lux514,3,Thu Jun 25 06:22:56 2015 UTC,"So perhaps a rephrasing of OP's question is: Why did the west come up with rule of thumb for itself: major = happy, minor = sad?  Also, just to qualify OP, what I would say is that in western classical music (i.e. when OP says ""the world of music""), it's generally taught (even if it is admitted to be an oversimplification by the instructor, it's still taught) that major = happy, minor = sad, just to get the lesson going (unless you're in a sophisticated music theory course, I imagine).  How did western classical music get there?  Is it just the result of the quirks of some 16th century music theorists?  Or is there something more inherent, perhaps something biological, or something mathematical about major vs. minor?  (Which is why OP then asks if other cultures have this major/minor distinction.  If the answer is that other cultures don't, then I think the alternative is to look within western classical music and ask why it happened that way there.)"

AskAnthropology,3ayabu,SandyRegolith,2,Wed Jun 24 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"The Musical Predisposition of the Infant   ""Musical skills that are evident in infancy, well before they have obvious utility, can be considered predispositions (p.3, Trehub, 2001)."" The notion of musical predispositions in humans assumes there is a biological basis for music. A marked skepticism still exists on the part of the scientific community in general, as displayed, for example, by Pinker (1997 in Peretz, 2001). Nevertheless, the researchers who dwell in detail on the musical phenomenon observe through the entire world its importance in cultural transmission, ceremonies, work, and childcare. Furthermore, as Trehub (2001) notes, we might assimilate competence with performance, that is to say that the musical capacities of the average person without formal musical training are remarkable if we take into account the complexity of tasks needed for grasping a musical sequence enough to march in tempo with the feet, reproduce melodic segments with words, or sing along in harmony.  In fact, the distinction of the melodic contour is the dominant characteristic in listeners of a very young age (Trehub, 2001). Babies can distinguish a change in the melodic contour even when a distraction or delay of 15 seconds separates the original melody from the melody of comparison. They can also distinguish changing intervals in a brief melody that conforms to the musical conventions of their culture. A nine-month-old baby is capable of detecting an out-of-tune note in a scale at unequal intervals (e.g., tonal scales or ancient modes compared to scales through tones); this suggests that babies treat the heights of sounds by regrouping them as adults do. Babies of a prelinguistic age already demonstrate a hemispheric specialization in the brain for music with a preference in the right ear-and therefore of the left hemisphere because the auditory nervous system is arranged at an intersection between the two hemispheres.   ...    Emotional perception in music (intrinsic emotional source) appears quite early on and is very likely innate (Masakata, 1999 in Peretz, 2001). For example, the four-month-old infant demonstrates a marked preference for consonance (Zentner & Kagan, 1996 in Peretz, 2001). In the adult, the decrease of the level of dissonance, or the augmentation of the level of consonance, corresponds to the activation of paralimbic structures associated with positive emotions (Blood, Zatorre, Bermudez & Evans, 1999). At three years of age, the child recognizes the joy in the music elaborated by its culture, and around six years he or she can identify sadness, fear, and anger (Terwogt & Grinsven, 1988, 1991 in Peretz, 2001). Dalla Bella and colleagues have demonstrated that at five years the child utilizes lively or slow character in tempo to base his or her emotional judgment on the distinction of joyful and sad musical extracts, and that at six years, like an adult, the child utilizes at the same time the signs of the tempo and the mode (major/joyful and minor/sad) to attribute an affective value to a musical extract (Dalla Bella, Peretz, Rousseau & Gosselin, 2001). There exists therefore at the same time a constancy and a remarkable precociousness concerning the emotional recognition in the music, one that corroborates the results of studies on babies' recognition of facial expression and is therefore linked to the core of the theory of biological predisposition (Peretz, 2001).  Moreover, babies can decode vocal expression much more than facial expression (Oatley & Jenkins, 2001 in Juslin, 2001). For example, a sad vocal expression is associated with a slow rhythm, a weak intensity, a weak intonation, and less energy in the high frequencies of the harmonic spectrum, parameters that the baby can recognize at an early age (Juslin & Laukka in Juslin, 2001). Besides, the utilization of songs in childcare is very widespread (Trehub, Schellenberg, 1995 in Tregub & Trainor, 1998) and is a practice that has roots in ancient and universal oral tradition. Furthermore, the human brain has cortical regions that are highly selective and specific for the perception and treatment of the human voice (Belin, Zatorre, Lafaille, Ahad, & Pike, 2000).  In the literature, scholars utilize the terms motherese speech or infant-directed speech (IDS) to designate the distinct way that adults as well as preschool-age children address babies (Kitamura & Burnham, 1998; Trehub, 2001). I have translated this term arbitrarily in French as ""langage parental"" (parental language).Based on the results of a series of experiments with six-month-old babies, Kitamura and Burnham (1998) have demonstrated that babies respond more to the affective qualities of parental language than to its linguistic characteristics, this having led them to think it might express a phylogenetic evolution of the primate's use of graduated vocal signals. Humans therefore share with other species the capacity to extract from the vocalizations of fellow creatures information about their identity and the affective tenor of their message (Belin, Zatorre, Lafaille, Ahad & Pike, 2000). We have known for around twenty years the distinct acoustic parameters of parental language: the voice is more high-pitched, with more of the higher variations, a slower rhythm, shorter enunciation, and longer pauses (Fernald & Simon, 1984 and Stern, Spieker, & McKain, 1982 in Kitamura & Burnham, 1998). This particular prosody, which nicely accommodates the attentional and perceptual immaturity of the baby (Fernald, 1992 in Kitamura & Burnham, 1998), is presented in an almost universal manner (Papousek, Papousek, & Symmes, 1991 in Kitamura & Burnham, 1998). Additionally, babies demonstrate a positive affect when they hear a text pronounced with a positive affect (Fernald, 1993 in Kitamura & Burnham, 1998). Kitamura and Burnham (1998) have identified three developmental hypotheses regarding the function of parental language: to engage and maintain the (limited) attention of the baby; to permit emotional communication and socialization; and to facilitate language acquisition.   https://normt.uib.no/index.php/voices/article/view/149/125"

The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC.[30][31]  According to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900.[32] Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom."

Pre corn and even corn agricultural systems relied heavily on wild plants for food as well. So grass seeds and wild game were incorporated.   I am making huge generalizations of course.

AskAnthropology,3aty1u,JayButta,44,Tue Jun 23 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely, but technically possible.   Consider a few things. Horses were likely domesticated only 6-7,000 years ago, and may not have been ridden until even later. Elephants are larger and more intelligent than horses, and require a lot of knowledge, food, and time to train or domesticate - things not in great abundance in 8-10,000 BCE.  Outside a few isolated pockets, most mammoths were likely extinct about 10,000 years ago. When we compare the date of human contact with those island pockets to the date of extinction with the mammoths, they almost always coincide. Humans exploited mammoths, they did not cultivate them like horses.   10,000 years ago could a human with the crazy idea to ride a mammoth have stumbled upon a lone mutant mammoth that was naturally tame, and had the best day of his life? Possibly, but I really doubt it, and until I see evidence suggesting anything close to it, such as a cave painting of the amazing day, I would say you can safely say such a thing did not happen."

I'm not kidding, I've had people tell me that. They think we just hang around in Africa digging for bones, and the 7 minutes they spent watching a NatGeo tv show about archeology put them to sleep.  I've gotten people hooked on the morbid stuff and the crazy stories about things I have seen or things my elders have told me. I interned in the anth department of a major US natural history museum, doing bio-anthropology. I worked for/with some of the best forensic anthropologists in the world (who were not full time FA's, there's not that much work in the US). So I tell people about interesting forensic cases I got to watch them work on (and their war stories). I also talk about the interesting skeletal remains I got to see in the course of my internship. Everyone loves the story of how, on my very first day, a 1000+ year old peruvian juvenile cranium fell apart in my hands (the maxillary section pulled away from the orbits and cranium) I was going to get fired right then and there.  I've seen the world's longest beard (17 feet, skin attached), scalped skulls (a lot of those, in the repatriation department), a huge room in a storage facility containing nothing but the skulls of elephants Teddy Roosevelt killed, and even mummies, some natural, some not. I can also tell stories from my advisor about the Hantavirus outbreak in the Four Corners area (people don't realize just how extensive anthropological work can be, covering things like tracking epidemiological information) and the New Mexico prison riots (although that is pretty gory, so I spare people who don't want to hear that much). I once watched the pygmy marmosets at the National Zoo get out of their open area enclosure, and can explain how humans aren't the only animals capable of war or homosexual sexual activity, and how I once saw a Mennonite mom try to explain to her kindergartener what the National Zoo gibbons were doing when they constantly copulated with the female who was in estrus (and I mean CONSTANTLY). I can talk about famous forensic cases, and for those interested in sociological stuff, about my undergrad research on the Satanic Ritual Abuse scare of the 1980's and 1990's.  I have found that I can hook people with morbid, crazy stories, and in the process of telling them, educate them and enlarge their understanding of what we do and how important we are to science, that we're not all digging in the dirt for bones and broken pottery.  tl;dr - I'm like the local news.

AskAnthropology,3at49f,rbaltimore,3,Tue Jun 23 16:45:49 2015 UTC,What's so particularly gory about the New Mexico prison riots?
AskAnthropology,3at49f,TheJackalope231,6,Wed Jun 24 04:52:19 2015 UTC,"The riots are considered one of the most violent riots in US penal history, with 30ish inmates dead, 200ish inmates injured, and a dozen guards who were not killed but were pretty brutalized. It's really not any worse than similar sized riots, like at Attica, but it's just that my boss was the one sorting out the bodies in this case, so I have heard her stories and have seen her photographs (all identifying information removed from both of course). It happened for a reason common among prison riots - horrible prison conditions, serious problems with guards' treatment of inmates, and in this particular case, cancellation of the recreational, rehabilitative, and educational activities available to the inmates. They spent half a decade or so with no outlet for their boredom, restless energy, and frustration at their treatment.  So many individuals were burned and/or beaten beyond recognition that forensic anthropologists were called in to help identify the dead and get some kind of a timeline of what went on inside. FA was a new specialty at the time, I'm not even sure they were called that, they were just professors and grad students at the local university that the police had used on a smaller scale before.  So, in the cafeteria, just as in the special protection cells, it was brutal. After it was all over, my boss was one of the ones trying to piece it all together (literally in some cases). They found this cranium, but could not for the life of them figure out what had caused it. It was perfectly round, as if a pipe had been jammed in, but there were no weapons, improvised or otherwise, that could have produced that kind of damage.   A few days later, looking at the map they had created of what bodies and weapons and cafeteria items had been found where, my boss noticed something - tear gas canister. She went over to where the evidence was being held, grabbed one (unused I think, it wasn't the actual canister used to kill the inmate), went over to the building where the bodies were being autopsied and identified, went to the skull - and it was a perfect fit. My boss had no idea how it didn't destroy the entire cranium and everything in it (and I have NO idea how tear gas canisters work now, let alone in the 80's), but there it was, a tear gas canister that exactly matched the fatal injury. Someone had fired a tear gas canister into someone's head.   I don't remember how it came to pass that the skull was skeletonized, but she had a photograph of the skull and a tear gas canister next to it. She always included it in her lecture about forensic anthropology (she was my teacher and then I became her TA for a few years). It's been 15+ years, and I can still close my eyes and see the image. It is a striking reminder of just what happens when prisoners are not treated humanely. Joe Arpaio would do well to study this riot."

AskAnthropology,3at49f,iron-on,6,Tue Jun 23 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it ruined a lot of lives - including the lives of the accusers. They really believed in these memories that were invented, created, iatrogenically. When you do that, the memories are as real as if they existed endogenously - if they were real memories of real events (google flashbulb memories to see how your memories are fake too). These memories, of things that never happened, destroy their lives. These individuals developed depression, anxiety, PTSD - all for things that were never real. They needed intensive therapy, medication, even inpatient hospitalization, and before we finally realized what was going on, the interventions and treatments for these created traumas just worsened their problems (google Bennett Braun to see the absolute worst of what happened to these patients). People (largely women) would go in to see a counselor for standard things - postpartum depression, run of the mill mood disorders, stress from work and home, marital issues, and well meaning but misguided mental health professionals (not always trained and licensed however, pastoral counselors and 'life counselors' etc.) would try exploring 'recovered' memories, rather than the mundane typical causes. (Social work and therapy can get boring - you tend to see the same 5 or so diagnoses over and over again, so the lure of the 'exotic', the unusual, and the culturally prominent can be strong if you've never been trained to watch out for that which, back then, they had not known to include in training).  People's lives were destroyed - and the destroyed included the accusers, they ended up as broken as the accused, only later learning it was all a lie. Some, like Jennifer Frey, still cling to the belief in these memories, these traumas that didn't happen (that's cognitive dissonance). Some have realized what happen and feel lied to, manipulated, and even more broken when they started, and just because you know that these things didn't happen doesn't mean families automatically come back together again. Patients are ashamed, they're not showing up at Thanksgiving saying ""Sorry Mom and Dad, I didn't mean to tell CPS and the police that you were satan-worshipping, child-abusing cannibals. But here, have some pumpkin pie!"" In fact, when, at age 21, I finally told my parents that I had been beaten and repeatedly raped by a counselor at summer camp, my father stormed out of the room, refusing to believe me. It was 2001, at least half a decade past the SRA scare, and father's first thought was that these were false 'recovered' memories, and that I would recover 'memories' about him as an abuser next. Yes, the fact that my dad is an asshole and my mother is insane are the biggest part of their reaction to me telling them, but my parents were so affected by watching the SRA scare unfold that 8ish years later, they were still worried that therapists were doing this with patients (I was in counseling at the time).  But we learned a lot. We learned that the tape-recorder theory of memory is bullshit. That memories are malleable, inventable, and can't often be trusted. We have learned how NOT to investigate crimes like these, the dangers of leading questions. We learned better therapeutic and law enforcement interview techniques - and this was all covered in my graduate social work program, how not to fuck patients up like this. We gained an unbelievable amount of insight into mass hysteria and the psychology of humans as groups, as well as the reality of cults - few are like Jonestown or Aum Shinrikyo. Most are just splinter new religious groups with transient membership and very, very short life spans. There was even an X-files based cult in my hometown called BDX - google it and Scott Carruthers, my neighbors from when I was a kid got sucked in. It lasted, maybe 4-5 years? The Baltimore Sun did a whole piece on it. My undergrad advisor was an expert on new religious movements (the academic name for cults) and he testified before several state congresses that the 'cult problem on campuses' was not actually a problem, essentially telling politicians to calm the fuck down. (Scientology was the only NRM he had concerns about. He had a lot of early access to them, before they closed ranks).  So yeah, it was a weird time. A lot of people got hurt, and we can only hope that the things we learned from the whole nightmare make the individual traumas slightly less meaningless."

AskAnthropology,3at49f,shocali,2,Tue Jun 23 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on my willingness to explain. When I'm not in mood, I answer I'll do public opinion research, polls, questionaires etc. (as I wrote I study social anthropology combined with sociology). It's something people can understand because polls and graphs are  everywhere nowadays. As far as I know most of my fellow students usually come to answer this way because it's just the most simple and specific example what social sciences do. People are usually okay with this answer or ask: ""Oh, isn't it boring?"" and I answer: ""Nah, it's actually pretty interesting."" and they're confused and don't ask anymore.  When I'm in mood to explain, I answer how sociologists and anthropologist are for example wanted in human resources departments or how social research may be helpful for functioning of society, how I may work for example for government agencies which concern on integration of foreigners and marginalised groups. I may use my knowledge to better describe intercultural conflicts and issues and thus relieve social tensions or how a study of ""the others"" may help us to comperhend each other and also comperhend ourselves.  When the people don't dismiss my effort at the point, I sometimes continue with a story about Margaret Mead's research in the UK during WW2 about cross-cultural misunderstanding between American soldiers and British civilians. I know Mead's contribution is a bit overrated but it's a specific example of ""how anthropology solved a public issue"", it's quite funny and people like it."

My career goal is to combine the tool boxes of both disciplines in order to bring anthropology to a wider audience and this idea was highly frowned upon by many professors in the anthropology department while being applauded in the history field.

And if so, does that change what it means to be selfish.   You also need to think about how much free will a person really has, if they've always been rewarded for being altruisitic in the past maybe that will make them behave altruistically even when there's no reward or a negative consequence - is that a purely pavlovian response or is that them being genuinely selfless?

I can only say some scholars, I can't recall the source at the moment.  To try and answer the question, yes and no? Race today and the concept of race in the past are two different things, one in that I do not believe the latter was as politically charged. You were more likely to hear about Christians being fed to lions rather than a certain skin color, which implies that religion was also a race - especially with the rise of the Muslim empire alongside Rome's decline, I think the concept was multifaceted beyond pigmentation. Religion, culture, language, appearance = race, not the superficial view of race we have today."

The book is called ""Socotra: A Natural History of the Islands and their People"" by Catherine Cheung and Lyndon DeVantier and as the subtitle suggests it focuses mostly on natural history. Seeing as human presence affected the natural history of the island there is some time spent on the arrival of humans. I don't have time right now to post the whole of the chapter devoted to the human presence, but here are two pages that focus on the earliest visitors.  Unfortunately, this book was published in 2006 and therefore does not have any mention of the Oldowan artifacts that were supposedly discovered in 2008.

People noticed that exposure to the old scabs of smallpox patients gave people a very mild case of smallpox, after which they would be immune for life. Originally they used the old blankets from the sickbed of a smallpox patient. This method was risky, as there was a small chance of getting infected with 'full blown' small pox, but not as risky as just to wait and see if you'll catch this disease with a 50% death rate.   As far as I know, there is no evidence Europeans deliberately engaged in biological warfare against the natives. There was no need or opportunity, as it already happened by itself.

AskAnthropology,3amk8n,ThiefOfDens,13,Sun Jun 21 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"This is long, but if you want a good idea of what the city of Tenochtitlan was like, here it is in Cortés's own words:  ...This great city of Temixtitlan is situated in this salt lake, and from the mainland to the denser parts of it, by whichever route one chooses to enter, the distance is two leagues. There are four avenues or entrances to the city, all of which are formed by artificial causeways, two spears' length in width. The city is as large as Seville or Cordova; its streets, I speak of the principal ones, are very wide and straight; some of these, and all the inferior ones, are half land and half water, and are navigated by canoes. All the streets at intervals have openings, through which the water flows, crossing from one street to another; and at these openings, some of which are very wide, there are also very wide bridges, composed of large pieces of timber, of great strength and well put together; on many of these bridges ten horses can go abreast...  This city has many public squares, in which are situated the markets and other places for buying and selling. There is one square twice as large as that of the city of Salamanca, surrounded by porticoes, where are daily assembled more than sixty thousand souls, engaged in buying and selling; and where are found all kinds of merchandise that the world affords, embracing the necessaries of life, as for instance articles of food, as well as jewels of gold and silver, lead, brass, copper, tin, precious stones, bones, shells, snails, and feathers. There are also exposed for sale wrought and unwrought stone, bricks burnt and unburnt, timber hewn and unhewn, of different sorts. There is a street for game, where every variety of birds in the country are sold, as fowls, partridges, quails, wild ducks, fly-catchers, widgeons, turtledoves, pigeons, reed-birds, parrots, sparrows, eagles, hawks, owls, and kestrels; they sell likewise the skins of some birds of prey, with their feathers, head, beak, and claws. There are also sold rabbits, hares, deer, and little dogs [i.e., the chihuahua], which are raised for eating. There is also an herb street, where may be obtained all sorts of roots and medicinal herbs that the country affords. There are apothecaries' shops, where prepared medicines, liquids, ointments, and plasters are sold; barbers' shops, where they wash and shave the head; and restaurateurs, that furnish food and drink at a certain price. There is also a class of men like those called in Castile porters, for carrying burdens. Wood and coal are seen in abundance, and braziers of earthenware for burning coals; mats of various kinds for beds, others of a lighter sort for seats, and for halls and bedrooms.  There are all kinds of green vegetables, especially onions, leeks, garlic, watercresses, nasturtium, borage, sorrel, artichokes, and golden thistle; fruits also of numerous descriptions, amongst which are cherries and plums, similar to those in Spain; honey and wax from bees, and from the stalks of maize, which are as sweet as the sugar-cane; honey is also extracted from the plant called maguey, which is superior to sweet or new wine; from the same plant they extract sugar and wine, which they also sell. Different kinds of cotton thread of all colors in skeins are exposed for sale in one quarter of the market, which has the appearance of the silk-market at Granada, although the former is supplied more abundantly. Painters' colors, as numerous as can be found in Spain, and as fine shades; deerskins dressed and undressed, dyed different colors; earthen-ware of a large size and excellent quality; large and small jars, jugs, pots, bricks, and endless variety of vessels, all made of fine clay, and all or most of them glazed and painted; maize or Indian corn, in the grain and in the form of bread, preferred in the grain for its flavor to that of the other islands and terra-firma; patés of birds and fish; great quantities of fish--fresh, salt, cooked and uncooked; the eggs of hens, geese, and of all the other birds I have mentioned, in great abundance, and cakes made of eggs; finally, everything that can be found throughout the whole country is sold in the markets, comprising articles so numerous that to avoid prolixity, and because their names are not retained in my memory, or are unknown to me, I shall not attempt to enumerate them.  Every kind of merchandise is sold in a particular street or quarter assigned to it exclusively, and thus the best order is preserved. They sell everything by number or measure; at least so far we have not observed them to sell anything by weight. There is a building in the great square that is used as an audience house, where ten or twelve persons, who are magistrates, sit and decide all controversies that arise in the market, and order delinquents to be punished. In the same square there are other persons who go constantly about among the people observing what is sold, and the measures used in selling; and they have been seen to break measures that were not true.  This great city contains a large number of temples, or houses, for their idols, very handsome edifices, which are situated in the different districts and the suburbs; in the principal ones religious persons of each particular sect are constantly residing, for whose use, besides the houses containing the idols, there are other convenient habitations. All these persons dress in black, and never cut or comb their hair from the time they enter the priesthood until they leave it; and all the sons of the principal inhabitants, both nobles and respectable citizens, are placed in the temples and wear the same dress from the age of seven or eight years until they are taken out to be married; which occurs more frequently with the first-born who inherit estates than with the others. The priests are debarred from female society, nor is any woman permitted to enter the religious houses. They also abstain from eating certain kinds of food, more at some seasons of the year than others.  Among these temples there is one which far surpasses all the rest, whose grandeur of architectural details no human tongue is able to describe; for within its precincts, surrounded by a lofty wall, there is room enough for a town of five hundred families. Around the interior of the enclosure there are handsome edifices, containing large halls and corridors, in which the religious persons attached to the temple reside. There are fully forty towers, which are lofty and well built, the largest of which has fifty steps leading to its main body, and is higher than the tower of the principal tower of the church at Seville. The stone and wood of which they are constructed are so well wrought in every part, that nothing could be better done, for the interior of the chapels containing the idols consists of curious imagery, wrought in stone, with plaster ceilings, and wood-work carved in relief, and painted with figures of monsters and other objects. All these towers are the burial places of the nobles, and every chapel in them is dedicated to a particular idol, to which they pay their devotions..."

But I suspect you're looking for something other than those three, as they're the most well-known.  One mid-American city which flourished around 1200 or so was called Cahokia, built near modern-day St. Louis. The giant clay mounds of its city center still survive, which is part of the reason we know anything about it at all.

As for Mesoamerica, there were many others than the Aztec and Maya such as the Olmec, Toltec, and Zapotec. People tend to overstate the Aztec and their abilities, in reality their 'empire' was very decentralized and unstable, and would have eventually collapsed on their own to be replaced by another state. The Maya on the other hand had lots of staying power, and even after the major collapse of their civilization continued on (there were major Mayan rebelions against the Mexican government until 1901 and continued Mayan resistance to this day).  You can see some of the biggest sites across both continents here and here."

There were many domesticated animals such as the dog, turkey, llama, and so on, as well as a plethora of staple crops such as maize, squash, melons, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, sunflowers, cocoa, and on and on."
AskAnthropology,3amk8n,themoxn,2,Mon Jun 22 02:08:16 2015 UTC,"The pre-Columbian population was already denser and more settled than that, and why would you assume they would have stayed the way they were 500 years ago?   I think, if the natives in the Americas hadn't been decimated by old world diseases, it would look a lot like Africa or Asia. Large parts would probably have been subjugated by European powers (assuming Europeans still developed a lead in military and naval technology without their new world colonies) and these colonies would probably still have been lost eventually."
AskAnthropology,3amk8n,Splorz,0,Tue Jun 23 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"Probably much the same as they did before Europeans got there.  The lack of pack animals made it pretty difficult to get large scale building (the Incas had llamas but they weren't nearly as good as oxen and horses) so the stone settlements would continue at a very slow pace even without major destruction like wars and natural disasters.  There also wouldn't have been a chance for any scientific revolution. Even if the various regimes and religions allowed for one, there wasn't the advanced metallurgy and glass-making that would have been necessary. And as I understand it writing systems for both language and numbers were pretty uncommon so that would have made preserving and spreading any knowledge difficult."

Tribal societies tend to be kinder and more communal while civilisations who reach a large enough population need to battle for resources.  There is also the fact that an agricultural society:   needs more work in order to be maintained (which in turn makes the people somewhat disgruntled). is less cohesive, making the members less attached to each other.   So since the African societies have generally been less technologically advanced than the rest of the world (god, I hope this doesn't get removed), maintaining tribal societies in many places, we could say that, yes, their culture is more nurturing than western culture, or beyond. As for why the west (and other places) has advanced so much, so rapidly, that's a whole other discussion.  The Roots of Addiction in Free Market Society by Bruce K.

AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Fishing-Bear,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that the question could be a bit clearer, but I'm not sure in what way cognitive anthropology 'dismisses' material culture, nor denies the role of objects in human social networks?  /u/Snugglerific (in this thread) mentioned Dan Sperber's 'Explaining Culture' and specifically the example of money - I think this is a perfect example of how cognitive anthropology might incorporate material culture, in this case through the concept of representations."
AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Protopologist,3,Sun Jun 21 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"...except that was his argument for why not all Anthropology can be considered cognitive.   Also, if we're considering all Anthropology to be cognitive, we simply cannot account for the agency of objects since that cannot be considered an aspect of cognition, nor can we consider architectonics or any other way through which objects, buildings, technologies or varying discourses and policies control the movement of bodies, or the social landscape in ways that extend beyond cognition."
AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Fishing-Bear,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I suppose what I was suggesting, and what I think Sperber says, is that there aren't really preferred 'domains' of anthropological question that are squarely 'cognitive' or 'cultural'. Rather, in answering a question about (for example) a building, anthropological analysis is strengthened by reflecting upon both the ways in which the building can be considered in terms of human (or indeed other forms of) cognition, and its status as an object beyond this framework. Sperber is calling for a more 'cognitively' inclined anthropology that nevertheless is able to avoid the traps of psychological and biological reductionism.  I think that both sides of this approach are 'anthropology', but I am interested as to whether you think there are objects (of study) pertinent to anthropology that cannot be studied using theories of human cognition? I am inclined to think that any such objects may no longer fall within the disciplinary boundaries of anthropology, but this may be an old-fashioned view."

Thank you!   edit: His discussion of agency as a state to be realized rather than an attribute to be possessed is actually pretty useful and it's definitely fun and exciting to see a biosocial reading of ANT, although (if I'm understanding his argument correctly) I'm not sure actants interact with one another exclusively  by way of a human actor with whom they are engaged in a reciprocal exchange of vacillating agency. . .Can actants, for example, exert ""agency"" in the absence of human actors? I imagine someone like Deleuze would argue yes, since to him, even the formation of mountains is an ""expression"" and therefore equally operative as anything produced through cognition. Then again. It's Deleuze. And even so, there can be no social consequences in the absence of human actors to react socially, so perhaps my (his?) point is moot in this context.   As an aside, I'd really love to see this guy write an analysis of policy making from this perspective of a shifting, almost competitive possession of agency between actor and actant."

One example of the ""epidemiology of representations"" is money. For money to work, we need to have similar representations in our minds of money.

AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Protopologist,2,Sun Jun 21 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"'Primitive' and 'civilised' are most certainly not evolutionary terms--not in any sense whatsoever. There is a marked distinction between social/cultural anthropology and cognitive anthropology. First off, the former is observation-based while the latter employs the scientific method. Second, most social anthropologists care little for how the mind works, while cognitive anthropologists are concerned with the cognitive mechanisms which give rise to culture and social behaviour."
AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Coles13,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:42:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is terribly accurate. ""Primitive"" and ""civilized"" is jargon associated with 19th c. cultural evolutionism, so the OP is not wrong in using that term.  Counterposing sociocultural anthropology and cognitive anthropology doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Many cognitive anthropologists are sociocultural anthropologists and they employ observation-based methods. Though experiments are becoming more de rigeuer these days, there is usually a melding of experimental and observational methods.  I'd say that cognitive anthropology, having historically been a rather small discipline, is in a sort of gray area. This is also perpetuated by the fact that a number of scholars who do work in territory covered by cognitive anthropology don't use the moniker. To take my US-centric perspective, though, I'd say cognitive anthropology is an interdisciplinary sub-field that draws on the four fields. The earliest work in cognitive anthropology drew on sociocultural and linguistic anthropology as with Romney's cultural consensus theory and Berlin and Kay's work on folk taxonomies. Then archaeology jumped on board with Renfrew's formulation of ""cognitive-processual archaeology"" and quasi-structuralist ideas coming out of historical archaeology (generally associated with Glassie and Deetz) that also went under the banner of cognitive archaeology. In more recent times, all these different projects seem to be melding even more with biological anthropology, especially with increasing interest in cognitive evolution where paleoanthropology becomes relevant as well as related disciplines such as neuroanthropology.  Finally, I would not say sociocultural anthropologists don't care about the mind. See my post above for historical examples. Maurice Bloch has a book called Anthropology and the Cognitive Challenge which covers some of this history and current issues. The one-sentence summary of the book might be something like ""Anthropologists ignore cognitive science too much and vice versa."" One of his criticisms is that many anthropologists do in fact talk about psychological issues but are too often not in dialogue with cognitive science literature."
AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Snugglerific,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"No, jargon associated with 19th century cultural evolutionism is definitely not modern evolutionary terminology. Those words are hangovers from a time which modern evolutionary thought tries quite hard to distance itself.  It's true that many cognitive anthropologists also do sociocultural anthropology, but the latter is generally informed by the former. I don't believe it is the case that many sociocultural anthropologists also do cognitive anthropology. Where I study cognitive and evolutionary anthropology, we deal quite heavily with culture, but there is no communication between my department and the sociocultural anthropologists, who tend to ignore what we do.  It's good that someone's written a book encouraging change in this respect. I pretty much agree with everything you've said, but still I see a sharp contrast between the literature in sociocultural and cognitive/evolutionary anthropology."

AskAnthropology,3ajxcv,Fishing-Bear,2,Sun Jun 21 12:45:44 2015 UTC,The answer to the question is hidden in the history of anthropological theory: in the transition from structuralism to post-structuralism and beyond.

AskAnthropology,3afp6q,thepibbs,8,Fri Jun 19 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Very much a nonexpert, but here is what I do know:  Glaciation certainly affected the spread of diseases, since it impacted the ranges and migrations of both animals and people. If two previously separated populations come together, then each is exposed to the other's diseases.  However, the event in the last million-or-so years that had the biggest impact on the spread of infectious diseases in humans was the Neolithic Revolution, which followed the last glacial period (c. 10,000 BCE). Before this, humanity was basically a loose collection of hunter-gatherer bands. The development of grain agriculture allowed for larger settlements. Thus, epidemics as we think of them today became possible.  Also, the most recent glacial period lasted from about 110,000 BCE to about 12,000 BCE. We have no extant writing older than 5,500 BCE, and the oldest cave paintings are from around 40,000 BCE. Discussion of human beliefs more than 100,000 years ago necessarily involves some guessing.

AskAnthropology,3aaqbr,shannondoah,4,Thu Jun 18 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"I know this answer is a bit late, but I've done a fair bit of reading on the genetics and identity of modern Assyrians (and Arameans), so I would be very happy to share with you what I have found. It's a very complicated issue, so I will try to cover all core information.  First of all, the modern people who call themselves Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, and Aramean all belong to the same ethnoreligious group, sometimes called ""Syriac-speaking Christians,"" since they speak dialects of Neo-Aramaic, a modern form of Syriac. What really differentiates them from each other is church denomination. Assyrians belong to the Assyrian Church of the East, also known as the ""Nestorian"" Church. This is the oldest church of the three that Syriac Christians belong to. Chaldeans belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church that split off from the original Church of the East in 1551CE. Arameans and Syriacs belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the ""Jacobite"" Church. Yet, they are all the same people, and the most commonly accepted label is the Assyrian one.  The conflict between the people who identify and Assyrian and the people who identify as Aramean has severely divided this community. ""Arameans"" are almost always members of the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, ""Assyrians"" are found in all three churches, though, of course, they have the strongest presence in the Assyrian Church of the East. Modern Arameans believe that they descend from the ancient Arameans, a tribal people who likely originated from the Syrian desert in southern Syria. Modern Assyrians believe that they descend from the Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Mesopotamia. This has caused an intense debate on the true origins and identity of the modern Assyrians. Personally, I have found the Assyrian side of the argument to be significantly better supported, via historical accounts, genetics, linguistics, and geographical location. However, there are scholars that support either side of the argument."
AskAnthropology,3aaqbr,550-Senta,3,Wed Jun 24 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"Now I shall cover some of the arguments that support the descent of the modern Assyrians (and Arameans) from the ancient Assyrians, rather than the ancient Arameans:  Linguistics:  Aramaic was introduced to the Neo-Assyrian Empire via deportation of some of the ancient Arameans to the Assyrian heartland, located around Nineveh. The ancient Assyrians adopted this language as the lingua franca of the empire, since it had an easier alphabet to use than the old Akkadian language that the Assyrians used to speak and write. Eventually, Aramaic replaced Akkadian entirely in the Assyrian empire, so this is the language modern Assyrians speak today. However, the ancient Assyrians kept some loanwards and grammatical structure from Akkadian when switching over to Aramaic. Linguist Geoffrey Khan deduces that the dialects that modern Assyrians speak today is not a direct descendant of Syriac. Rather, it shows elements from Akkadian that are not present in other forms of Syriac. See: http://www.aina.org/articles/rothbotmal.pdf  Genetics:  Population genetics studies have shown that Assyrians, Chaldeans and Arameans are the same people, as individuals have a high genetic affinity with each other. Genetically, they are a fairly homogenous group of people. Here's my argument that I copied from a post I made in reply to an Aramean user's argument on AskHistorians:  ""It is important to remember that most of the population of the Levant and Mesopotamia, as well as other areas where civilization was developed the earliest such as Greece and Egypt, is primarily descended from the people living in those areas before the Arab conquerors arrived and changed the culture of the region, since the native population was much greater than that of the invaders (for a general discussion on this, see: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16zl9b/are_modern_greeks_egyptians_etc_mostly_descended/).  This would mean that the people living in modern day Syria who live in the region that was formerly Aram are mostly descended from the Arameans, with limited Arab admixture.  You may be wondering where I'm going with this. Well, according to this genetics study (http://www.rau.am/downloads/publ.kafedr/episkoposyan_medbiolog/Yepiskoposian_I&C_06.pdf)  that compares the affinities of Assyrians to Syrians and other ethnicities and nationalities in the Near East and the Caucusus region:   the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies.   If the modern Assyrians were mainly descended from Arameans, then they would have a strong genetic affinity with the Syrians who are mostly descended from Arameans. However, this is clearly not the case here. In reality, Assyrians are genetically more closely related to Northern Iraqis, who are also likely descended mainly from the Assyrians and other indigenous peoples of Mesopotamia that had been Arabized, not ancient Levantines.  Another thing to remember is that Syriac Christians, no matter which church or region they are from, are a fairly homogenous population, meaning that they are genetically closely related to each other.  See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeogenetics_of_the_Near_East#Iraq_.28Mesopotamia.29  This chart (http://i.imgur.com/WFhftWf.jpg) from the Dodecadad genetics project shows the close genetic affinity of Assyrians to each other. The ""Nestorian"" church, the Chaldean church, and the Syriac Orthodox church are all represented in these samples. Also note that all samples except one have over 50% of the ""West Asian"" component. This component indicates a largely native background to the area that includes Anatolia, the Caucasus, and northern Mesopotamia, rather than the Syrian desert in south Syria, where the Arameans are supposed to originate. Had Assyrians been mostly Aramean, the ""Southwest Asian"" component would've been either equal to or greater than the ""West Asian"" component, just as it is in Syrians.""  It should also be noted that Assyrians are much more closely related genetically to Armenians, their longtime northern neighbors, and other Caucasian and Anatolian groups, rather than Arabs from the Arabian peninsula and Bedouins. This makes sense geographically and historically. Modern Assyrians are likely primarily descended from the ancient Assyrians of the Middle Assyrian period and the Neo-Assyrian Empire. These ancient Assyrians, in turn, are likely descended from pre-Semetic people indigenous to northern Mesopotamia and southeastern Anatolia. These people adopted the Semetic Akkadian language and identity when the Akkadians arrived and conquered the region.  See the following:  Autosomal DNA Admixture comparisons between Semetic-speaking and Non Semetic-speaking Near Eastern populations:  http://i.imgur.com/LWseQkb.jpg  Autosomal DNA Admixture comparisons between Near Eastern and European populations:  http://i.imgur.com/gtyadDG.png  Naming and Location:   Much of the controversy surrounding the identity of modern Assyrians is centered around the terms ""Syria"" and ""Assyria."" The reason why this is so significant to the debate is because the modern Assyrians have always called themselves ""Suraya"" or ""Suryoye"" in their own language, which literally translates into ""Syrian."" I won't get into this well-worn debate much here, but some scholars argue that the term ""Syria"" is derived from the term ""Assyria,"" while others argue that ""Syria"" is derived from the term ""Aram."" The fact that the regions of historical Aram and Assyria were located right next to each other certainly doesn't simplify the debate. However, generally speaking, Aram is now present-day Syria, while Assyria is now present-day northern Iraq. It is the latter than the modern day Assyrians ultimately originate from, and one of the core areas of the Assyrian homeland is the Nineveh plains. See the following links for more on this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_for_Syriac_Christians#Assyria-Syria_naming_controversy  http://www.aina.org/articles/frye.pdf  http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v11n2/JohnJoseph.pdf (Aramean argument)  http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf  Historical Accounts:  There is much evidence that the Assyrian identity has survived from the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C.E. to the present day.

So, why does the Aramean identity exist, and why are Assyrians who identify as Arameans such a strong proponent of it? Well, part of the reason why some members of the Syriac Orthodox Church are opposed to the Assyrian identity is because the ancient Assyrians are given a very negative image in the Old Testament and the Bible. However, there is a more complex and sinister reason why this identity arose. See the following link:  http://www.betnahrain.org/bbs/index.pl/noframes/read/46992  As is shown in the link above, many members and leaders of the Syriac Orthodox Church used to call themselves Assyrian, and some were actually very strong proponents of Assyrian nationalism. In the 1950s, however, the pan-Arab government deliberately infiltrated that church and made the leaders adopt this new identity. Why? To further divide the churches and, therefore, the Assyrian people as a whole, which the Arab governments fear due to Assyrian nationalism. A clear case of ""divide and conquer"" is seen here.  To this day, we see a huge amount of conflict and division amongst the Assyrian people based on these splite identities. The division is especially bad in large diaspora communties like those in Sweden, where there is a fierce rivalry between two football teams: Assyriska FC, founded by members of the Assyrian Church of the East, and Syriaski FC, founded by members of the Syriac Orthodox Church. With these divisions, the modern Assyrians are prevented from uniting together to effectively protect themselves in their own homeland.  There's plenty of information about the identity of modern Assyrians (and Arameans) out there. If you would like to know more and read more links, just ask!  EDIT: formatting"

On to the issue:  Thai, like Zhuang spoken in China, is a Tai–Kadai language. So is the Lao language. These two are closely related and have a clear common ancestor.  Thai (or Tai) covers a large geographic area, and has origins further North (as do many of the languages in the region). However it's not accurate to suggest that all the languages in Southeast Asia are that closely related, if related at all.  Also spoken in Thailand is Khmer, the language of Cambodia. Khmer is Austroasiatic (a.k.a. Mon-Khmer), not Tai-Kadai. Austroasiatic languages are also widespread in the region and have a lot of internal diversity.  There are also the Hmong-Mien (a.k.a. Miao-Yao) languages, which are again not related to Tai-Kadai.  The problem is that while we know that around 3000-5000 years ago these language groups were already separate, we don't actually know what was before that. There's no evidence to suggest that Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien and Mon-Khmer are actually related further back in time. It's possible that they are, but we can't actually say that at this point.  If the author is in fact making the suggestion that all these languages were related 10,000 years back, then he's drastically overstating the situation, and in a way that can't be backed up. The jury is still out on whether or not these language groups share any common ancestor, and at this point all we have to think that they might be is casual speculation.  I wouldn't take his claim too seriously about the commonality of it all back then. As for things being less diverse in general, well there were far fewer people in the region at that time, so already you can expect it to be at least a little less diverse just for that."
AskAnthropology,3aalt5,keyilan,2,Thu Jun 18 23:44:31 2015 UTC,"The idea is that the languages of Thailand and neighboring regions are descended from the same proto-language. Without being a specialist in that part of Southeast Asia (and being on mobile) I can't say what proto-language that would be. Regardless, the concept is generally the same everywhere: one language transforms and separates over time and distance into various regional variants, which eventually become so different that a native speaker of one will have trouble understanding a native speaker of another. Then these variants are properly called languages.  If you were talking later though, around 500-1500 AD, you'd approach my specialty (maritime SE Asia). If any language could be said to act as a cultural universal through most of the region's complex societies, at least for the upper classes, it would be Sanskrit and attendant Hindu/Buddhist philosophy brought by Indian merchants."

They had not followed us during the night when we broke through the government troops surrounding us. Fearing that the Salvadoran military would otherwise detect their presence, her companions gave her the choice of either leaving the cave or stuffing rags into the mouths of her hysterically crying children. Over a decade later, there was disagreement over whether the father was justified in subsequently abandoning the mother for killing their two offspring. Some hailed the mother as a hero for having chosen to sacrifice her babies in an attempt to safeguard the lives of her companions in the cave. It was taken for granted that she would have been captured, had she left the cave with her crying children, and under torture she likely would have revealed the location of her hidden companions. Nevertheless, years later, doubts persist over the moral worth of the hapless mother, yet again blurring the boundary between hero and villain in counter-insurgency war"""

AskAnthropology,39z0t6,BattleSalmon,12,Fri Jun 19 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"This is actually a bit more complex: Scientific Socialism does put a low value on the family as a unit of society, but the Soviet State also recognised it was a powerful force for cohesion and control. Additionally, the Soviets required new comrades and this could only come from reasonably controlled women within a ""family unit"".   Marx states that the family is the basic unit of human society, and that all other units (including the capitalist and feudal states) are based on this. It's for this reason that initially many Communist states attempted to break up the power of the family unit, as the Marxist state would not have such retrograde features and would be based on a ""scientific and rational"" worldview. In practice the fact that communists only ever took power in highly agrarian peasant societies meant that the family unit could never be eradicated and was eventually brought in to help support the State's objectives."

AskAnthropology,39z0t6,KeenBlade,5,Tue Jun 16 08:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yes absolutely. Mass educational facilities attended by all children and educated by professionals able to form a generation of capable new comerades did exist, and in some cases children were taken from their parents and placed in these facilities, particularly in the cases where the parents might show ""counter-revolutionary"" tendencies. (For what it's worth, this strategy was used to destroy indigenous identity in North America and Australia. Children were taken from their families and formed into new units within State-controlled schools.)  To some extent these efforts were successful: in the USSR education was provided at no cost past tertiary level. This helped break up hereditary power and wealth and educate millions. A darker consequence of the State taking a more active role in the education of children was that often their alleigance might be to the State and not their family: parents might be turned in by their children for seditious or illegal activity. This is porbably more of a consequence of totalitarian education, but the effect was a certain breakdown of the family unit.  The Socialist (Marxist) ideal for education would probably be one that all children have access to, and where the pre-conceptions and irrational behaviour of parents or the family unit generally would not have a perverse effect on the child."

AskAnthropology,39u95p,anthroqueen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"That's certainly an interesting idea. I would say that it would probably be a small bias, though, for a couple reasons. Firstly, that once people started burying their dead, everyone was buried. It was just practical, and once it became religious it was pretty par for the course everywhere. You're correct in saying that wealthier people have nicer headstones and coffins. However, the conditions of the ground are much more influential in the preservation of humans skeletal remains than wood (which decomposes much faster than human bone). And finally, in the locations aspect, generally a graveyard was a graveyard. There might have been a nicer area where the rich people were buried, but that has a lot to do with what it looked like above ground and very little to do with what the soil was like. Not to mention that it's unlikely the soil would drastically change in a (relatively) small area. Good thinking, though.

AskAnthropology,39ukja,ImperiumBritannia,3,Sun Jun 14 22:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not an anthropologist, but I'm an economic historian and dabble in demography.   Young people leaving home, working for a while to save for marriage, and then marrying fairly late (late 20s for men and women)  and establishing their own households is a north western European pattern going back to the sixteenth century or so. The famous paper to first describe it is by Hajnal 1965, and is called something like 'European marriage patterns in perspective' . The idea is that young people needed to work to save money to establish themselves before they could afford to marry.   The phenomenon is called the European marriage pattern. Currently there's a growing and somewhat controversial literature around it, debating what the (economic)  caused and (economic)  effects of it have been, and it's relationship to women's ability to earn income, aka labor force participation and relative wages.   The pattern is also associated with lower fertility (especially since women married at older ages), higher rates of non-marriage (marriages were entered into by the young people, not arranged as in the south, and setting up a new household was expensive )  and the establishment of poor laws and welfare systems (since there were fewer children living with and able to take care of their parents in old age) .   The southern pattern is what we think of as the 'stereotypical' early modern or medieval marriage pattern, where spousal age gaps were large, girls married young and moved into their husband's parents' house, and marriages were arranged.

AskAnthropology,39pz78,inquisitive872,31,Sat Jun 13 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"The Roma (aka Gypsies) are hard workers but they like to see themselves as working within their own system, with different values from non-Roma (Gadje). One of the things they prize is not necessarily hard work but instead being able to trick the Gadje out of their money. Of course, this can also cause them more work than just getting the money legitimately. However, once they've acquired the money, some Roma men will burn it in public displays to demonstrate how free they are from the system the Gadje have built around them.  As another example, often, in the time of Colonialism, Europeans would come into an area with grand ideas of how to ""improve"" the living conditions of a people, by teaching them a work ethic. Usually, the results were disastrous, because most people lives/behavior are adaptations to their environments. I believe it was the British (I really can't recall but they're always a good guess when it comes to colonialist misadventures) who tried to introduce cotton growing/processing and cattle herding to the Azande in south Sudan. It didn't take. I can't remember why the cotton failed (probably poor growth conditions/lack of infrastructure) but I do remember that raising cattle would never work in the region as long a tsetse fly relative (which affects cattle) persists in the region.  So while the British perceived the Azande as lazy for not being industrious pastoralists, they were actually behaviorally adapted to life in the region. They could raise chicken and goats because both animals were unaffected by that particular breed of fly. However, the British did not value goat and chicken production as much as cattle."

First, I would like to say that it's difficult to classify all Jews the same way. They live in many different countries and while simultaneously defined by a religion and common ancestry, they take different approaches in their relationships with their religion, and this translates into their relationship with the Gentiles.  Similarly, the Romani can be found in multiple countries and continents, they share no common language, food, or religion. So, saying something like, ""all Romani believe this..."" can be problematic, even moreso than saying something like, ""all Texans are oil-drilling, gun-toting, Republicans"". Just as such a broad generalization about Texans is wrong, similarly attempting to make any generalizations about the Roma can be inviting folly.   I will say though that while my understanding of the traditional Jewish view of the Gentiles is patient tolerance, the traditional Romani view of the Gadje is more symbiotic.   Many Roma accept the necessity of the existence of the Gadje and rely upon them for their livelihood, while; due to years of abuse, discrimination, and exploitation; remain suspicious and distrusting of them.  However, I would like to think that the current Jewish view of the Gentile has changed greatly. It's no longer so much Jew/Non-Jew today.  For the Roma I'm not sure the same could be said. The Roma have no country so they have no real international representation. Even today, European countries where the Romani populations are the highest have a tendency to treat them as nuisances or pests. While the Romani enjoy taking advantage of the Gadje, their reluctance to draw any negative attention to themselves likely prevents them from doing anything overtly harmful. However, they do like to maintain their individuality and (relative) independence from the Gadje."

I remember reading somewhere that one possible reason for this is because, as opposed to England, being idle was considered a good thing in Portugal by the time they started their colonization process over here. It sounds an awful lot like what you find in The Protestant Ethic -- IIRC Weber argues that societies colonized by Catholics are not as developed as societies whose immigrants were Protestants, because they didn't value hard work as much. I read that book a long time ago though, so take that with a grain of salt.

AskAnthropology,39o4d1,UnbiasedPashtun,11,Sat Jun 13 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that person who (often needlessly) problematizes a simple question to seem clever, so I will start off by saying that no, I don't know of any culture like this. It would be quite surprising if there were, because night is naturally a time of increased danger for humans as a species.  That said, the relationship between black/white and good/evil was not a simple one in ancient Egyptian. There did exist a good/evil dichotomy (mꜣꜥt vs. ỉzft), but it was not neatly aligned with color at all. Looking at the image of the goddess Maat, you can plainly see that she is not depicted as being especially white. Further, this dichotomy isn't exactly good/evil, more like mores/antisocial behavior, but it is still fairly close to what you mean. ⲙⲉⲑⲙⲏⲓ < mdt-mꜣꜥt is the word Jesus uses when he says: ""I am the truth"", so there are some pretty direct associations.  The problem with black and white is that they're really not tied to the good/evil dichotomy that was so central to Egyptian moral attitudes. The word for ""Egypt"" in Egyptian was kmt (Coptic: ⲭⲏⲙⲓ/ⲕⲏⲙⲉ) which literally means: ""black thing,"" referring to the black soil of the nile floodplain where people lived and grew crops, as opposed to the dšrt ""red thing"" of the surrounding, uninhabitable desert and valley walls. So there is a black/red - good/bad analogy that is much more pervasive. However, there are some very old associations with ""darkness"" as a source of evil. Wisdom texts warn against going out at night because of thieves, and the Hermipolitan Ogdoad (a very old mythological cycle) contained a god and goddess pair of ""darkness,"" but these weren't evil necessarily. They were simply elemental components of the natural world. Any evil associated with darkness has more to do with the fact that there were no streetlamps rather than a more abstract, conceptual association. Later Christian writings translate the ""place of darkness and gnashing of teeth"" with the same word as the names of this god/goddess pair, but that's translation, and it's simply what the word means, so it's not really accurate to say that such a negative association would have always existed."
AskAnthropology,39o4d1,amemut,6,Sat Jun 13 14:23:31 2015 UTC,I think it might be important to distinguish black as a color and black when it represents the abyss/unknown/chaos (which of course was quite negative in ancient Egypt as elsewhere).
AskAnthropology,39o4d1,firedrops,2,Sat Jun 13 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"I partially agree.1 The exact phrase from the bible (KJV): ""but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness"" is (Bohairic): ""ⲛⲓϣⲏⲣⲓ ⲇⲉ ⲛⲧⲉϯⲙⲉⲧⲟⲩⲣⲟ ⲉⲩⲉϩⲓⲧⲟⲩ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ⲉⲡⲓⲭⲁⲕⲓ ⲉⲧⲥⲁⲃⲟⲗ"" (italics mine). The translation is very clear in its description of ""darkness which is outside"" and it is clearly expressing a Christian concept.  The ancient Egyptian notion of what lay beyond the known world was, in one sense, the dwꜣt or underworld, which is not intrinsically evil, but can be perilous, or in another sense, the cosmic ocean, in which our world was understood as a sort of air bubble in an infinite sea. So even the notion of an ""outer darkness"" didn't exist early on. The hostile surrounding desert would be the closest analogue, but this was never associated with darkness to my knowledge. First of all, this would directly contradict the black-land/red-land dichotomy, where the negative part is the color red, also associated with Seth. Secondly, the desert isn't darker than the flood plain in any way. The White Desert is literally white. So it wouldn't make any sense to associate ""outer chaos"" with ""darkness"" in an ancient Egyptian mythological context.  Edit 1: I originally said: ""I completely agree"", but then I realized that I actually don't. I do appreciate the point you're making though, and agree that it should be discussed."
AskAnthropology,39o4d1,amemut,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yes good point I meant the abyss was potentially dangerous and without order in ancient Egypt. But that even in societies where black or darkness is associated with that chaos black is a symbol and all symbols are multivariant. It is also interesting to consider color choices for depicting ""black"" such as the common practice of using blue to depict dark dark skin in Hindu art forms.   Color symbolism is a really rich area of study. The red/black dichotomy you point out is a great example of that."
AskAnthropology,39o4d1,firedrops,2,Sun Jun 14 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"It certainly is. This is what I aiming towards when I said that I didn't want to needlessly problematize the question, but color symbolism is almost never as simple as black vs. white. In fact, this color dichotomy is probably the simplest one in existence, and it's near ubiquity could simply be a consequence of its being a major axis of the human perception of color, which would make it physiological rather than cultural and therefore both common and prone to extremely subtle distinctions cross-culturally.   It really is a great question, both in its simplest form, and in the ways in which you can dig deeply into it."

AskAnthropology,39mwdo,BirdsMilkCake,-3,Sat Jun 13 07:44:19 2015 UTC,"Whether or not men provided the majority of the more desirable or rare food like meat doesn't address their possible preference for large lips, or even for small lips which may have been selected for instead, for that matter.

Presumably more dominant men, and women for that matter would have taken more food for themselves. Certainly men would have eaten more food if they were larger.

That said, there is, as Gould would put it, a ""just-so story"" about the evolution of curls vs. straight. That is to say, that there is educated speculation about the divergence of straight hair from the norm, but that we don't really have the evidence to make conclusive statements about the cause.   Basically, the idea is that curly hair helps to hold the hair off the scalp, allowing heat to radiate. Humans being ""savanna apes,"" heat management is a reasonable factor for discussion of our evolutionary history. Jablonksi & Chaplin (2014) put it this way:   Individuals with short straight hair and shorter permed hair had lower sweat rates and experienced less loss of total body mass after heat exposure. Together with the evidence from studies of heat gain and loss in birds and nonhuman mammals, these findings suggest that short, curly, Afro-textured hair evolved because it can maintain a boundary layer of cooler, dryer air near the scalp, and thereby protect the thermogenic and thermosensitive brain. This hypothesis warrants experimental testing.   So yeah, some support from the literature that rocking an afro is a great way to beat the heat, but this is far from a conclusive proposition. The converse idea (which has even less evidence to support it) is that the hair of Eurasians is different not so much in it's straightness, but it's oily-ness. The idea being that dry/curly hair acted to radiate heat in the tropical climes we evolved in, but that it became more adaptive to have oily/straight hair in cooler climes with more consistent rainfall. Essentially the idea being that curly hair acts as a parasol and straight hair acts as an umbrella. This is solidly in the just-so story area of armchair theorizing though."

AskAnthropology,39n27a,anthroqueen,7,Sat Jun 13 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"Is there not a difference, though? The procedures you list are all meant to be invisible, and mimic natural possibilities.  Earrings might be a better example."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,Vladith,2,Sat Jun 13 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"For the record, many of the body modifications listed in the original post can be called within the realm of natural possibilities, considering they're achieved without surgery. Especially the neck rings and the head binding. They're actually using much less invasive and extreme procedures to accomplish what they want."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,anthroqueen,5,Sat Jun 13 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"That's a bad comparison, both for the reason u/vladith stated, and because those are relatively uncommon and if anything somewhat stigmatized procedures. They're not part of our cultural background in the way face tattoos are for the Ainu or neck rings for the Kayans."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,anthroqueen,3,Sat Jun 13 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, fair enough. But I'm still not sure about the generalization with indigenous groups and body modification. The Picts had tattoos too, and for that matter they're heavily prevalent today. And why classify Ainu tattoos as body modification but teeth blackening as cosmetic?   Essentially, most or all of the procedures are done to fit cultural standards of beauty. They will definitely seem more noticeable to you because they're not your cultural standards of beauty. But it's not as though Western standards are less extreme, it's more that we're so familiar with them we don't notice them. An excellent article that highlights what our standards might seem like to someone from another culture is The Body Ritual among the Nacirema by Horace Miner. It's a little older, I believe (edit: yes, from 1956), so you could include things like dyeing hair, shaving, waxing (especially bikini wax! That must seem insane to some people, it's so painful), plucking eyebrows, you name it. Our cultural standards don't seem extreme to us, just as theirs don't seem extreme to them."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,Vladith,4,Sat Jun 13 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"While I find the word problematic, the Picts were absolutely a primitive people, in comparison to contemporary Romano-Britons."

It really depends on your definition of primitive (which is kind of problematic anyways). And the  Romano-Britons are 'primitive' by comparison to the Chinese of the same era! So what, in your thinking, connects 'primitivity' to body modification?"
AskAnthropology,39n27a,Vladith,0,Sun Jun 14 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"I've got absolutely no idea! I think, if anything, societies that modify their bodies are seen as more primitive because body modification is rare in Western culture.  That being said, circumcision and especially earrings are just as ""unnatural"" as so many non-western practices. I'm certain that if earrings were worn in Japan and not in Europe, Japanese culture would be seen less favorably."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,anthroqueen,3,Sun Jun 14 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"Come on man, be real. Let's leave tattoos alone for now, things certainly get fuzzy there.  But scarification and lip plates and neck rings and head reshaping are on a whole other level than hair dying and waxing, and you know it. This is not a matter of ""what seems strange to us doesn't seem strange to them"". The procedures I mentioned are absolutely objectively more extreme than anything commonly practised in the first world. Comparing a slightly painful and temporary hair removal procedure with a years-long process of mutilation that leaves the body permanently and drastically altered is just ridiculous on its face. You're avoiding the question for some reason that I can't fathom.   The only culturally accepted form of body modification we see in the first world that is on the same level as scarification, lip plates, and neck rings is plastic surgery. And since that procedure is meant to be ""invisible"", bringing the body closer to an ideal of beauty which exists independently of that procedure, I believe it to be qualitatively different."
AskAnthropology,39n27a,sumbuny,4,Sun Jun 14 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, then how are lip plates different from ear stretching (I'm not sure what it's called, when people wear larger gauges of earrings to make the holes larger)? And I believe tattoos are absolutely relevant, due to their prevalence in Western society and their parallels with the Ainu mentioned in the original post. I also have an issue with your depiction of plastic surgery. You say it's meant to be invisible. Why is that relevant? The parallel is that in both cultures people are changing their bodies drastically to conform to society's definitions of beauty. I don't think it matters whether it's meant to be visible or invisible. The change is visible. When someone gets a nose job, their nose looks different. That's the point of it. When you say   bringing the body closer to an ideal of beauty which exists independently of that procedure   That applies to both examples. Plastic surgery, scarification, neck stretching, all are done to bring the individual's body closer to an ideal of beauty. The point of it existing independently of that procedure is a little shaky. One could argue that Western beauty standards are impossible to achieve naturally. Who has extremely large breasts and hips and a tiny waist? Who has a lengthened head? Who has large eyes and a pert little nose with a perfect plump bow mouth? Who has a gorgeous long neck? For these things to occur together is very unlikely. Many people will have certain aspects of a society's beauty standards, but for them all to occur in tandem is so rare I can't think of anyone except this girl who might actually meet them all. As to my avoiding the question, what I'm trying to say in response to the question of why extreme body modifications seem so present in 'primitive' cultures is that it's because similar practices in our culture seem normative to us. Even if we say it's different in degree, which may be true, it's absolutely not different in kind."

We just don't know how the first languages evolved, nor do we know if they evolved separately at separate times or just once in human history. We don't know if language is a cultural tool or a biological feature of humanity.  All of these things are still being debated and research is still being conducted to try to figure out the answers.

AskAnthropology,39arrd,Th3Marauder,37,Wed Jun 10 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"One reason many history textbooks jump from 100,000 ya to 10,000 ya is simply because not much changed. With the birth of the agricultural revolution, mankind exploded both in population and technological advancements, prior to that, hunter gatherer tribes and communities were all that you would find. 75,000 ya was the smack dab center of the middle Paleolithic era, much of the technology was fairly unchanged for tens of thousands of years. Depending on what your stance is on the toba volcano theory, mankind's population was likely very small. No more than 20,000 in total, spreading from central and northeast Africa to West Asia and Mesopotamia. Humans rarely would have interacted with other members of the homo genus at this point, however sparse communication homo neandertalis and homo erectus may have happened. Otherwise very little was happening, groups between 10 and 20 would have depended on the surrounding environment, living between 40-60 years."
AskAnthropology,39arrd,Stormageadon,12,Wed Jun 10 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, so there are several issues with your answer that are indicative of the problems with the popular version of human history. I want to address these issues so everyone can learn about the topic.  First, there was a massive, revolutionary change in our species between 100,000 and 10,000 ya: we started to develop art and other indications of abstract thought. Though we were anatomically modern ~200,000 ya, meaning skeletal remains look like modern humans, we only became behaviorally modern in the last ~75,000 years. The earliest evidence of this breakthrough occurs at Blombos Cave in South Africa where crosshatching on ochre and modified shell beads appear ~70,000 ya. There were other highly debated instances of in art during the Middle Paleolithic, but the diversity of styles and forms of art increase substantially in the Upper Paleolithic starting 50,000 ya. We cannot say nothing much changed when one of the key things that makes us human, our ability to deal in abstraction, developed during this time period.  Second, even though technological change is slow in the paleoanthropological record, changes were occurring, especially during the Upper Paleolithic. After ~50,000 years ago we see an explosion in art, varieties of tool kits spread through time and space like Aurignacian or Chatelperronian, and the apparent emergence of long-distance trading links.  That brings us to two other huge changes during this ~75,000 year period; our species spread around the globe and encountered other hominins. The amazing, rapid pace of skill in food acquisition needed when encountering a new place, as well as the development of a variety of tools, weapons, housing, clothing, and watercraft needed for a large-bodied, relatively hairless primate to survive in ecosystems ranging from Siberia to Sudan, not to mention the necessity of inter-generational transfer of that new knowledge, is nothing less than astounding.   Finally, though we may never know how regularly, or in what manner, our species interacted with other hominins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, genetic evidence does suggest gene flow between those two species and ours. That evidence raises all manner of interesting questions like the possibility of communication between species, and even the ability of two different hominins to occupy similar niches at the same time.  Simply stated, human history in the period between 100,000 ya and 10,000 ya is filled with ""human firsts"", fascinating areas for future research questions, and ultimately represents an amazing time in the history of our species."
AskAnthropology,39arrd,anthropology_nerd,2,Thu Jun 11 23:06:33 2015 UTC,"The earliest evidence of this breakthrough occurs at Blombos Cave in South Africa where crosshatching on ochre and modified shell beads appear ~70,000 ya.   I wouldn't be so fixated on ""earliest evidence of this breakthrough"". These things are very temporary, depending on whatever the latest scholarship is, and it keeps changing all the time.  There is evidence of the same stuff - pierced shell ""beads"" and use of ocher from Grotte des Pigeons in Morocco at 82,000 years. There is evidence of similar shell beads from Skhul Cave in Israel at 100,000 - 135,000 years. Given that older stuff has deteriorated more and is harder to find than more recent stuff, and given that new discoveries still keep pushing back the dates for ""behavioral modernity"" further and further in the past, I wouldn't be so eager to believe that some ""massive, revolutionary change happened in our species between 100,000 and 10,000 ya"".  I think an equally valid hypothesis is that modern humans were always modern, that behavioral modernity goes back to the dawn of our species. It may be simply that older artifacts are harder to find, or that perhaps it takes some certain population density in rare fortuitous times to leave behind beads and ocher. Meaning that these finds don't necessarily mean that some massive change happened right here at this time and hence we see beads, they can equally well mean that we had behavioral modernity all along, it was just some local set of circumstances that produced the artifacts we see today. Like I said, perhaps an unusually rich resource location that remained populated for a hundred years, long enough to leave behind artifacts that we were lucky enough to discover.  While it's possible that some great revolution came along (perhaps complex language?) that spurred things on, there is really little evidence to date it. I think it's probably more reasonable to believe that modern humans (Homo sapiens) have always been modern. Scarce, scattered populations don't leave a lot behind, and that's how humans were for most of the early years. The big change is when humans left Africa and populations started climbing, with the Aurignacian ~50,000 years ago. Then we suddenly get a lot more artifacts. But as Blombos or Grotte des Pigeons or Skhul show, we certainly had the capacity for making trinkets long before that."

You don't even have to talk about the Amazons (although if you're asking about a nation of women who cut off their right breast so they could shoot better, then no). However, we have lots of records, but often societies are more complex than just the word 'matriarchal'. They could be matrilineal, matrilocal, matrifocal, and a number of other descriptors. If you're interested in specific societies, you may want to narrow down by geographic area.   EDIT: Now I'm not so sure. u/EvanRWT has enlightened me as to how some societies might be labelled matriarchal but upon closer inspection don't quite fit. When I originally answered this question I was thinking of a specific lecture, and probably didn't do as much investigation as I should have."
AskAnthropology,39bpoj,anthroqueen,9,Thu Jun 11 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"I thought matriarchal was not the same as matrilineal or matrilocal? From my understanding, there are quite a few matrilineal or matrilocal societies but no society that can be called matriarchal in the same sense as the word ""patriarchal"" is used - aka, a society where men hold most of the economical, political and social power?"
AskAnthropology,39bpoj,Sunjammer0037,3,Thu Jun 11 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"It's not, you're right. The issue is that patriarchal and matriarchal are not polar opposites. Because generally women are valued less in a patriarchal society, whereas the opposites (that men are valued less in a matriarchal society) isn't necessarily true. The point I was trying to make in my first post was that you'd probably never find a society that is matriarchal in the sense that many modern societies are patriarchal; but, if you have a society that has all the other descriptors (matrilocal and matrilineal and matrifocal), then you're getting pretty close to a society where women are highly valued. Just not necessarily highly valued at the expense of men."
AskAnthropology,39bpoj,anthroqueen,0,Thu Jun 11 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"Just because women are valued does not mean that men are devalued. For example, in modern society, masculine traits are valued, but feminine traits are not, no matter who exhibits them. Men who exhibit 'feminine' traits may be mocked and derided for not behaving more masculine, and females are invalidated for exhibiting female traits (like the recent comments from Tim Hunt about females in labs). Men would play a different, but valued role in the society.  The best example that comes to mind is from an undergrad lecture (I may not be remembering it quite well), in a horticultural society. Women would stay at home, tend to the children who were valued as the next generation, and grow small crops. Men would hunt during the day mostly, and then come back to the settlement. Women were valued for their expertise in growing food, so that if the men were unsuccessful in hunting, people would still have food to eat. They were also valued for their ability to have children and care for them, as children were rare and precious. The men being able to hunt was valued for bringing variety to their diet and protecting them from antagonists (the men would also go to war).  This is definitely an imperfect example, but it's just meant to show that the three traits listed, even if they all apply to a society, does not mean that the men in that society do not suffer from it.   On the other hand, if we're comparing to a modern patriarchal society and the levels of power that men have in it, then I suppose they do have less power in the society described above. But both sexes are more equal, and there has not been any society documented (that I'm aware of, at least) wherein men have little to no power the way that women have and had in the past in most of the world's societies.   I hope that helps clarify!"
AskAnthropology,39bpoj,anthroqueen,2,Sun Jun 14 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really change the definitions, does it?  A matriarchal society is one where political power is primarily in the hands of the women. A matrilineal society is one where childrens' descent is traced through the mother. A matrilocal society is one where the husband moves in with the wife's family after marriage. A matrifocal society is one where the mother and kids make the family unit, and the father plays a lesser role.  So going by accepted anthropological definitions, there is no known instance either today or in the past of any matriarchal society. There are some examples of matrilineal, matrilocal and matrifocal societies, but they are not the same thing.   but, if you have a society that has all the other descriptors (matrilocal and matrilineal and matrifocal), then you're getting pretty close to a society where women are highly valued   But there are no instances of that either, so far as I know. Can you provide an example of a society that was matrilineal and matrilocal and matrifocal? Off the top of my head, I can't.  And I would point out that the presence of these things doesn't necessarily mean that women are highly valued. For example, matrifocal societies are often highly patriarchal -- men have several wives and mistresses, and each lives in a separate home with her children. The father visits each of his wives periodically. Similarly, matrilocal societies may have nothing to do with the elevated status of women, they may simply have an elevated status of the father of the bride, meaning that he can demand that the bride price for his daughter is that her husband come and live in his household and help with his farm/business/whatever.  There are a lot of subtle nuances that we need to be aware of, and we shouldn't be quick to jump to conclusions. Maintaining specific and unambiguous definitions and being careful with our language is part of that."

What I was trying to say (which could have been worded better) was along the lines of - maybe we don't have examples of a matriarchal society in the strict sense. But there are societies that, and I'm trying to say this as clearly as possible, have attributes which may lead to them being classified as matriarchal, for lack of another descriptor. Mainly societies that stand out because the attributes they have are in opposition to what we regularly see in patriarchal societies. I've definitely learned more from this discussion, thanks for your input!"

AskAnthropology,39bpoj,BizouBisou,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"Take it with a very large grain of salt.  ""The Mosuo culture is most frequently described as a matriarchal culture; in fact, the Mosuo themselves frequently use this description, to attract tourism and interest in their culture.""  ""It is true that they have aspects of a matriarchal culture, in that women are the head of the house, property is passed through the female line, and women tend to make the business decisions. But political power tends to be in the hands of males, which disqualifies them as a true matriarchy.""  ""Some anthropologists studying the Mosuo describe it as a culture that focuses not so much on the female lineage, as on the lineage of the house itself.""  ""Historically, the Mosuo actually had a feudal system in which a small nobility controlled a larger peasant population. The Mosuo nobility practiced a more traditional patriarchal system, which encouraged marriage (usually within the nobility), and in which men were the head of the house.""  ""It has been theorized that the ""matriarchal"" system of the lower classes may have been enforced (or at least encouraged) by the higher classes as a way of preventing threats to their own power. Since leadership was hereditary, and determined through the male family line, it virtually eliminated potential threats to leadership by having the peasant class trace their lineage through the female line. Therefore, attempts to depict the Mosuo culture as some sort of idealized ""matriarchal"" culture in which women have all the rights, and where everyone has much more freedom, are often based on lack of knowledge of this history; the truth is that for much of their history, the Mosuo peasant class were subjugated and sometimes treated as little better than slaves.""  From the Mosuo's own website.  Briefly, the Mosuo are not matriarchal, and never were. They are matrilineal, with children identified through the family of the mother rather than the father. And this was not how they actually developed, this was forced on them from the outside by the rich upper classes, to keep them subjugated."

There's evidence for controlled fire use in the archaeological record at least 750ka, and it probably goes back over a million years. The advent of cooking was a significant event in human evolution, because it allowed us to evolve a shorter gut and direct more energy to our brains, and Homo erectus is the first human with body proportions similar to our own (implying a similar gut length, in contrast to the rounded bellies of modern nonhuman apes and earlier hominins).

AskAnthropology,39cidb,Cideleetivy2,5,Wed Jun 10 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"I believe they eat more meat due to the lack of a habitable environment for vegetation to grow. Fun fact, certain indigenous people of northern Canada need to eat whale blubber during the winter because the small amounts of vitamin C in the whale stop them from getting scurvy."
AskAnthropology,39cidb,morningstar24601,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"Very interesting... but is there a biological reason to eat more meat? Because if Indigenous Northern Canadians came down to Florida and had a pint of OJ- would that be fine?  Have northern people ""evolved"" characteristics that aid in digestion of meat, animal products, etc?"
AskAnthropology,39cidb,morningstar24601,3,Wed Jun 10 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"Their morphology shifted to accommodate for the cold. In one of my anthropology textbooks it mentions this phenomena. The distribution of their body weight and the length of their appendages changed to better suit the cold winters and lock in body heat.  This is from Foundation of Human Culture - Human Morphological Variation   Allen's rule. One primary selective force acting on body build is Allen's rule:  Animals living in colder climates should have shorter appendages and be more spherical than those living in warmer climates. This says that laterally built people should be found in colder climates and linearly built people in warm climates. This is true for humans on the average. The traditional comparison is between the Inuit and the Masai. The Inuit of the far north tend to be stocky with short arms and legs. The Masai of east Africa tend to be very tall and slender, with long arms and legs.   As for evolving an ability to eat more meat I haven't seen studies that show other people across the world are unable to eat just as much meat as anyone else, assuming that they are given time to a just to such a diet. That being said, there's far more meat being consumed in places like the USA than their should be. This causes health problems with many Americans and could be used as evidence to show that eating copious amounts of meat is in general bad."
AskAnthropology,39cidb,ctrlshiftkill,2,Thu Jun 11 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"If anything I think the situation may be the opposite: instead of evolutionarily adapting to capitalize on an all-meat diet, northern peoples have probably adapted culturally to make up for the lack of non-meat nutrients in their diet. u/moringstar24601 mentioned vitamin C from whale blubber, but among inland groups who rely on caribou instead of whales, they get their vitamin C by eating the semi-digested plant matter from the intestines of caribou they hunt (apparently they consider it a delicacy)."
AskAnthropology,39cidb,anthroqueen,5,Thu Jun 11 04:23:42 2015 UTC,"Say rather that they have less options. Very little vegetation grows up that far north. All they have in abundance is snow and meat. They have many cultural adaptations to help them get as much nourishment out of the meat as possible. However, if they moved down South and started eating more veggies, they wouldn't suffer from lack of meat.   Think of it like this. All humans require amino acids in their food to help in proper cell function. Some of the twenty amino acids (I can't remember the exact number or which ones) we can make ourselves. The others we must ingest. Meat usually has all the amino acids because it was once an animal that too, required all 20 to function - unless the animal itself had a deficiency. However, this does not mean we need meat specifically/biologically. It just means that meat is an option. So now we turn to high north populations. Meat is their only option. They don't really have a choice. They have to eat other parts (like u/morningstar24601 pointed out) of an animal to help them stay healthy, because meat doesn't have everything.   To sum up, no, they had no biological reason to eat more meat. Yes, if they came down to Florida and had some OJ, they might be really confused as to what it tasted like, but it wouldn't hurt them. No, they have not evolved characteristics to aid in digestion of meat.   A side note: I don't think Eskimo is a PC term anymore. It might be different for Alaska, I don't know, but in Canada we usually say Inuit."
AskAnthropology,39cidb,ctrlshiftkill,2,Thu Jun 11 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"There are no culture groups that identify as Eskimo, because it's an outsider term used to describe people pejoratively. But not all Arctic people identify as Inuit either, and if I'm not mistaken the therm ""Eskimo"" is still used by geneticists to describe haplogroups, and possibly by linguists to describe language families - groups which include Inuit, but also include other groups such as the Aleuts and Greenlandic Eskimos (as I'm typing this I realize that I don't know another term to describe Greenlandic Eskimos so the term must still be in use, at least among those I learned it from!)"
AskAnthropology,39cidb,gh333,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think you are confusing native Alaskans and Greenlanders. Indigenous Greenlanders are Inuits, in fact Greenland has the largest population of Inuits. The majority of peoples we think of as Eskimo are Inuits, and they also have the widest geographic distribution.  However, there are a few groups of Alaskan (and East Russian) natives who do not identify as Inuit, namely the Yupik, Aleut and Inupiat. The reason Eskimo is still used is because it encompasses all of these populations without confusing them with other North American indigenous groups.  In general, if you are talking about arctic North American indigenous peoples that are not in Alaska, it's probably safe to say that they are Inuits."

Take into account that while family names are traditionally inherited from the father, the DNA is 50%/50% from both parents.  So while you can have the family name of your father's father's father's [...] father's immigrant father from the 17th century, you have as much his DNA as you have from your mother's mother's mother's [...] mother's mother from the 17th century, who you know nothing about.  Consider the period of 1615-2015, that's 400 years. Assuming an average child-bearing age (generation age difference) of 25 years, that's 16 generations.  A person has 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 great-great-grandparents, etc.  Going all the way back in this way we can count that there are 65536 ancestors in the generation that is 16 generations above in the family tree.

Note also that I grew up in the nineties so I believed in the stories about as much as a child in america may believe in Big Foot.  There are a bunch of scandinavian creatures who may be refeered to as ""alfer"" (singular: alf) or ""vättar"" (pronounced waettar and singular: vätte). Although vättar is a more genral term where as alfer mostly refers to the small ones, like fairies and dwarves.   This can get more confusing by the fact that ""fairy"" can be a general term in Britain the same way as vätte.  Elves were, as I recall, not some regal people of old but rather a weird thing you could encounter in the woods. The size vary, sometimes very tall and sometimes like a hobbit. This might because of the confusian between the word ""alf"" and ""alv"", swedish for elv so sometimes they'd be used for different things in different stories. But the nature of elves were that they were shy and not really fond of humans. They seemed to posses powerful magic though so if you could talk to someone you could ask for magic help.   I recall there also being something sinister about elves because they reminded me about ""vittror"" which I was specifically told would be beautiful women who would lure men in the woods and then eat them.   Kinda weird that they told me that as a child now that I think about it. But I guess they just remembered old tales and told me so I wouldn't do stupid things. Now that I'm older and started reading about folklore it seems as if almost all creatures are invented to explain a phenomena, like the Mara which was supposedly what caused sleep paralysis, or they were invented to stop kids from doing stupid shit because they wouldn't listen if you just told them no, like the Näcken (Necken) a beautiful naked boy playing a instrument by the river and if you approached him he would offer to teach you and thren drown you so don't play by the river you stupid child or you'll met the Näcken.   Trolls are a little more interesting since they didn't seem to fill a function in my child mythos and were just weird people. trolls were supposed to be big and hairy and dirty but contrary to contemporary depictions they were not beasts, A troll could trick you and it could speak about things.   Now that I think about it I guess trolls would fill the function of warning me about pedophiles since trolls loved kids. A particular book I don't remember the name of tells about a little girl who goes to far into the woods and encounters a mountain troll. The troll wont let her leave unless she can answer it's question but when she does it doesn't want to let her leave anyway so she just runs. I guess the lesson there was to stay away from strangers who starts talking to you.  Another thing about trolls is that they would steal kids and replace them with their own. And since trolls where dirty savages my mom might ask me if I'd been replaced by a troll baby if I were a little shit. The old term for being kidnapped by trolls was ""bergatagen"" which means ""taken to the mountains"" which is where the trolls lived.   There are a lot of vättar to talk about but I don't know how much is to much for you original question so I'll just finish up with the ones you named.  Orcs are a Tolkien invention, they are just corrupted elves and used as a faceless enemy in the books. Nothing like orcs exists in my folklore as far as I know, the closest thing would be Dark elves/Goblins who were kinda like trolls but smaller and less talked about.  Ogre or Ogress is as far as I know a french term and doesn't always refer to a real race of people, rather it is used as a derogotary term for people so cruel it seemed inhuman so people would have said they were ""not like us."" The ogre story I'm most familiar with is the tale of Bluebeard, a rich nobleman who marrys young girls and then kills them and hangs them on hooks in the basement.   Dwarves were not that relevant in any story I read or heard. They really just served as a blacksmith archetype in a story. The whole image of them as a pround miner/warrior people seems to be entirely Tolkiens creation.  Anyway, this is what I remember, exclamation on the ""I"". It should in no way be used in any academic or school paper as a legitimate source of folklore research."

Sometimes it just may not have happened for no particular reason other than no one bothered to try it in any seriousness.   Be careful about interpreting various pages about it as well, many of them reference Zebras being difficult/impossible to domesticate and cite examples and reasons. But in all cases they're attempting to go from Fully Wild Zebra to Fully Domesticated Zebra in one generation, or less, in just one or more animals. In the distant past it may have taken many many generations for man to originally tame the horse, we just dont know. What the Russian Fox experiment suggests is that it takes much effort and time to cull out the wildness. You could easily ask why was the Horse domesticated. Well, for meat initially I guess, and then someone found a fun secondary use."

This is in contrast to the X chromosome, which shows wide diversity of mother horses.  Archaeology shows that people kept captive horses for winter food long before they ever rode them.  Cattle aren't as good at digging for grass in the snowy steppes of Western Russia, horses kept themselves alive without being given grain or hay.  It may have been a single docile stallion that was discovered in the food supply that was kept and bred for riding.  Mares are more docile by nature, so mares would have been be drawn from multiple wild populations.  There were actually two other domestication events of equines- onagers (wild asses) were domesticated in the Near East, but they were uncooperative and they were eventually replaced by the ass, which was domesticated in Nubia.  Donkeys may have been slightly easier to domesticate, in that their reaction to predators is more often to stand and fight rather than to flee.  They evolved in arid climates with smaller predators."

AskAnthropology,394mz2,autoposting_system,37,Wed Jun 10 00:58:56 2015 UTC,"Nearly all domesticated animals have a genetic mutation that reduces cortisol levels. Cortisol is a stress hormone and animals with typical levels will avoid humans and show aggressive behaviors when in close proximity. Lower levels of cortisol are necessary for an animal to be calm in human presence and show signs of curiosity. Because all domesticated species and very few wild species show low cortisol production, there are two possible explanations for domestication (we do not know which applies for any particular species):    Selective breeding of tame animals for domestication is genetic selection of low cortisol production. If there is not enough genetic variability in ""tameness"" then the low cortisol gene may not be present in that population, and therefore it can never be selected for. That species (such as the zebra, renowned for being jumpy) cannot be domesticated.  Domestication in many circumstances appears to be driven by population dynamics of the animal rather than human intention. Genes for low cortisol production allowed an animal population to forage in human settlements and even form symbiotic (or parasitic) relationships with people. This is probably the most widely held view of what occurred with dogs and cats, and possibly horses. No zebra population has had a spontaneous genetic mutation allowing for lowered cortisol production, so they have not voluntarily domesticated.   Here is a very good overview of these processes in a fox domestication program highlighting the same cortisol mutation in domestic guinea pigs; skip to the ""Neuroendocrine changes under domestication"" and ""Destabilizing selection as a possible accelerator of evolutionary transformation of domestic animals"" sections."

There isn't much difference between the approaches used in ""developed"" versus ""undeveloped"" countries, for example Vikings, American Indians and Traditional Japanese all independently discovered ""sweat bathing"" e.g. the sauna/sweat lodge/Sentō; all well before industrial development.  The invention of soap also lead to a popular approach to removing oily substances from the skin.

AskAnthropology,38xouc,satnavtomington,12,Sun Jun 7 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you mean all animals since this in an AskAnthropology subreddit, but I can speak to primates.   The short answer is no, not in the same way, however primates can be picky. When we say picky we imply a conscious choice to choose our mate, but even in humans while we would like to argue that our decisions are driven by a conscious choice the science of it all proves that we have less authority than we would like. All primates (including us) behaviors' are driven by our individual phylogeny and our environment. Where and how food is dispersed has long term effects on how primates behave and build their social groups. In some instances yes there is bonding. The best example is gibbons. Gibbons live in pair bonds and typically mate for life, however just like in many bird species who are pair bonded they will mate with neighboring gibbons. This is called extra pair copulations. In other instances primate groups participate in bonding behaviors all the time not necessarily related to sex, though particularly in bonobo's sex can be a form of bonding and not mating.  Without going into excessive detail I'll say that most primates mate opportunistically. However, once again those opportunities are driven by their social structure, and sexual competition. Females may unknowingly choose a mate with healthy genetics. A well known example of this is in peacocks. Male peacocks with brighter plumage actually have a lower parasite load. The females don't choose because of this, they choose because the male is bright and colorful.   Primates are fascinating because in the over 200 species we see much variation. We like to call it primate socioecology. There are entire classes taught about these topics.   Most primates function on female choice because lets face it, sperm is cheap. Eggs are in limited supply. However the manifestation of this choice takes many forms and is once again driven by their social structures. A new world primate like a male squirrel monkey is chosen by a mate because at one point during the breeding season their testicles become enlarged and a bright monkey with large testicles attracts ladies. In Orangutans, a solitary species, a female listens for the long call of a male and determines whether or not he is fit for reproduction, and may go to him. The diversity is remarkable. Many times these female ""choices"" boil down to ""how can I mate with the healthiest male and get my genes out there"". Males can mate as much as they want and therefore even in male dominated societies females can still find ways to choose.      My favorite example of female choice is in male dominated groups who have a harem of females. In these groups there are bachelor groups of outcast males and then there is the top primate with all his power (and likely healthy genetics) and his harem of females. When and if females sense a takeover they will sneak off and mate with the male who is likely to takeover. They do this because in the presence of a male takeover the males commit infanticide. In this instance if the female has her baby unless another new male takes over. Nobody but the mother knows the father of her baby.     Humans are picky for entirely different reasons and when you compare us to our ape cousins you see some similarities and differences in which we can draw conclusions about our own evolutionary history. There are many who argue back and forth about our own true monogamy and choice. Some say that humans are not monogamous at all, and they have good evidence. The jury is still out, but if you're really curious I would recommend anything by Karen Strier on Primate Ecology."

I don't think /r/AskAnthropology is the right place to ask this question, though.   There are a number of bird and mammal species that bonds either lasting for a season or a lifetime. Generally, when both parents are invested in rearing the offspring, the stronger the bond has to be. Take emperor penguins, for example. The male has to endure the polar night for months at a time without food, until his mate returns. Their bond is what keeps them going.  Bird partners who are caught cheating red handed can be brutally pecked for their infidelity, and sometimes the male will kill the offspring of the other male (if it's the lady who cheated). There are a ton of Nature documentaries on PBS.org that you can watch, including a two-part episode, ""What Females Want and What Males Will Do.""   Birds and mammals are pretty picky, I think, but in different ways. There is this one type of bird where the ladies will only pick the dude with the darkest feathers. So, the scientists designed an experiment where they used a magic marker to color one of the paler males very dark. He was very popular with the ladies! Blood tests also showed that his testosterone levels increased after being colored. He was also a very dutiful father gathering all the food for the babies.

If you were to ask what the average height of people is in US States that begin with the letter A vs states that begin with the letter M, that would seem a bit odd. The natural next question would be ""why are you grouping those states together?"" That question arises every time you group disparate groups of people into a single population.

It could be that half of the countries have mostly type O blood while the other half have mostly type A. What have you learned by grouping them together? You've lost information. When you group populations together willy-nilly without any kind of reasoning, your analytical lens gets blurred, unless there's some interesting reason to group them together. For example, if you want to look at blood type in high malaria prevalence countries vs low malaria countries, you have grouped a bunch of different ethnically and genetically diverse people together, but you've done it because you think that there might be a pattern based on a unifying characteristic.

AskAnthropology,38o2yc,javierNelson,2,Fri Jun 5 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't the Decameron predate The Canterbury Tales by about 100 years, with the same basic premise? 10 characters gather around, each one tells a different story. If so, I'd say that beats out The Canterbury Tales as the first.   I've read very little of The Decameron, but The Canterbury tales are told all from the one pilgrim's point of view (often referred to as Chaucer himself), so he is the one writing down/retelling the tales. Before the Knight's Tale begins, for instance, Chaucer writes, ""And he at once began, with cheerful face,/ His Tale. The way he told it was like this:"" so it really isn't from another character's point of view, and we'd even have to take it at the narrator's word that he is retelling it accurately. The Decameron is told...partly in third person, partly in first (from what I can glean scanning over it now), but with each character giving an introduction to themselves, so it is closer to multiple narration frames, but still not quite there. I'd say neither truly counts for what OP is asking, but they are similar/close.   As well, the gospels of the Bible were collected together after the fact and put into the New Testament. They were written by different people about the same events, with no intention of ever being put together, so I'd say that doesn't quite count, either. That'd be like saying an anthology of books could be considered a case of multiple narrators.  Unfortunately, I'm really not certain what story would count as the first one. I only have a good knowledge of English/European literature, and many other cultures were writing before they started."

But I did come across this passage from Social organization of the Manchus: A study of the Manchu clan organization1   Kissing, generally speaking, is usually considered by the Manchus as a purely sexual act. It is permitted to kiss a boy who has not attained the age of 10, but after this age kissing is prohibited. The father may kiss his daughter until the age of 5 only and the mother her son until the age of 8. The husband and wife, also lovers may only kiss each other stealthily and kissing is considered to have a shameful significance (pg 125)   Which shows that it maybe ok to kiss children.  UPDATE -- yes, yes they may have  BUT, only a few pages later he writes:   Usually the Manchus are very kind towards their children. The adult persons pet small children. The mothers suck their small boys' penis and tickle the sexual parts of girls. Generally speaking, the Manchus children and adult persons pay great attention to the sexual organs. The children usually are very affectionate and obedient. The mothers are always affectionate towards their children and it can be very often observed when the mother being in some other family as guest chooses the best pieces of food for her child to the loss of other children. The children being favourites are even sometimes spoiled, very often become burdensome to their parents, who patiently bear the children's caprices. The first-born child does not get any special attention from the parents, but it is usually very beloved and in the Manchu tales it always figures. Besides the stick very carefully planed, the Manchus do not use any particular methods of education. This stick is hung near the door by side of another one, which is not planed. The latter is for the dogs. However it must be noted that the stick has rather a moral influence, because it is very rarely used. (pg 133)   So, this seems to be an accurate assertion at one time. However, it should be noted this was published by Shanghai, China: Royal Asiatic Society,  vi, 196 p. in 1924.

You might also argue that the languages of the users shape what kind of mythologies they create to varying degrees, but that's not exactly what he is quoted for.  Tolkien observes in the very same paragraph that auxiliary languages can exist and be used without any oral tradition, so it seems he came to this conclusion as well. By ""dead"" I assume he means that they have no tradition of being passed on or organic use as anybody's first languages, but are learned later in life as tools, much like the ancient languages he refers to.  Based on what I know of Tolkien he held the view that mythology and language were intimately connected and lamented the fact that the pre-roman mythology of Britain had largely been lost along with the now-dead languages. I'm speculating now, but I would guess that he was exaggerating for effect (or possibly hoped that as the constructed languages took root, they would begin to form their own oral traditions)  Edit: autocorrect shenanigans"

AskAnthropology,38j5uf,ImmortalRationalist,11,Thu Jun 4 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"I had to read this one over many times before I figured out how to respond.  First. Cool question, that's something I've never thought of before.  Okay, here we go. That argument about animal domestication is one I've never seen before, but I suspect it has everything to do with that one word:  advancement. Advancement is a very touchy word in anthropology, and most experts don't like to use that word, because of reasons like: it implies progression is good, it ranks societies in terms of who is more advanced, it provides the basis for numerous racist arguments, it carries connotations of intelligence, etc. So this depends on your definition of advanced. For the purposes of this post, let's define advanced as ""allowing them to invent or innovate new technologies"". Moving on. You are correct in implying that animal domestication first occurred not in North America or Australia. It probably happened somewhere in the Middle East, or Southern Europe (location varies for different species). Among the first animals domesticated were the dog, pig, and sheep. Note that none of these could be considered megafauna. Are you referring to species like the elephant? In any case, elephants were domesticated relatively much later, sometime during the Indus Valley civilization. So, humans didn't really domesticate megafauna at first anyways. On to your question. I'm going to answer this in a serious way, and a fun way! Fun way first.  Oh man, how cool would it be to have chariots drawn by freaking saber toothed tigers? Can you imagine using giant red deer as mounts? What about a guard American lion? Or a giant beaver? The possibilities are endless and very, very cool. We'd all probably be way more badass than we are now if those Neolithic dudes had domesticated megafauna.   Serious answer. Probably very few to none. There's a reason that the species humans first domesticated were relatively small. Bigger animals are harder to subdue once they get to big size. People even find this today with dogs (and pigs!), that once they get to their adult size, if they weren't properly trained when they were younger you don't have a lot of control over them. In your words, very few of the species of megafauna were 'capable of domestication'.   Source for the elephant info: Sukumar, R. (2003).

AskAnthropology,38j5uf,anthroqueen,5,Fri Jun 5 02:51:47 2015 UTC,"I also read this questions several times and couldn't figure out how to answer, but I think your answer is great. However, I think it's important to note that domestic cattle were domesticated at least twice (possibly three times) as early as 10kya from the auroch, which qualifies as a megafauna by any definition of the term - they were about the same shoulder height as most species of Megaloceros deer. Not only that but they are pretty similar to North American bison, and humans lived along side them for tens of thousands of years and never domesticated them. I don't know if Jared Diamond thinks aurochs would be more suitable for domestication than bison, or if he thinks there weren't enough bison ""available"" for domestication in North America for some reason, but I don't think it's safe to say that ""availability of animals capable of domestication"" was a major factor in the ""advancement"" of most societies."

AskAnthropology,38j5uf,anthroqueen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"Having read ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", this question has also occurred to me in the past. If you read Diamond's full explanation of what makes an animal domesticatable, the answer has to be, without the animals around to evaluate their behavior and temperament, we'll never know. Diamond gives the example of closely related species still alive today, some of which are/were domesticated while their close relatives are not. For example  most of the antelope species in sub-saharan africa are not domesticatable because after capture, they simply never calm down. They continue to struggle until they break limbs or send themselves into cardiac arrest. Zebras and Horses are also cited. Zebras are kept in captivity, but Jared distinguishes between the behavior of tamed wild animals and domesticated animals. Tamed zebras are often still quite dangerous and frequently injure their handlers.  In domesticated animals, humans take the place of the alpha in the social organization of the tamed animal. They behave socially toward human beings as they would normally to the dominant member of their social organization and will depend on the humans the way a tame wild animal never will. It should be noted a number of scientists don't really consider house cats as domesticated, but instead regard them as tamed.  Some candidate extinct species that might have changed history in North America include the Western Camel. I like to think herds of Jefferson's Ground Sloth would be a great scene in alternative histories too."

I'll do this with purely made up figures. If there are 10million animals in an area and something allows 1million of them to move over a mountain range into a new zone, then because the new area has a starting pool of only 1million, as opposed to the original group of 9mill, then obviously there is 9 times more genetic information in the originals.

AskAnthropology,38dazd,myxopyxo,17,Wed Jun 3 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"First, one needs to distinguish between people migrating, and languages migrating. It turns out that languages actually move in very different ways than people -- people can adopt a new language without ever going anywhere.   There is no hard evidence for the place of origin of the Germanic languages. All of this happened before the beginning of historical records. The historical distribution of the languages as well as archeological evidence point to an origin in what is now Denmark and northern Germany, sometime during the first millennium BC.   There is no sort of agreement however on what caused the Germanic languages to spread. Usually languages are spread because their speakers have some sort of advantage over their neighbors: military strength, better technology, a new religion... It is not known what this advantage of the original Germanic speakers was.   Ultimately, Germanic is an Indo-European language, and so Proto-Germanic would have been related to other Indo-European languages in the area. But as Germanic and other languages (such as Slavic) spread, the other Indo-European languages in the area -- most likely including the older languages of what is today southern Germany -- became extinct."

I'm fairly skeptical of claims that D&D is a carrier for orientalist influence into the broader geek subculture on the basis of the existence of these options.  The Jargon File, maintained by Eric S. Raymond, notes that martial arts and computer programming are well-correlated historically, being ideologically compatible in ""exaltation of skill through rigorous self-discipline and concentration"".  I suspect this has more to do with orientalism in tech than more recent cultural phenomena (further evidence that this influence goes way back is provided by the AI Koans composed at the MIT AI Lab in the 70s and early 80s, and the Tao of Progamming, published in 1987)"

AskAnthropology,37rmvq,Exemery,20,Fri May 29 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"The Venus of Willendorf is a very famous statuette depicting a woman with pronounced breasts, a large stomach and an extended vulva. Some people suggest that this was a fertility goddess given the dramatically enlarged sexual areas, though it must be said that we have no idea what the statuette actually represented. This piece of archaeology is 30'000 years old and, without a form of writing or larger archaeological body of findings, we cannot give the piece context. For all we know, this could be a self-portrait or even an insulting caricature.  Sexualisation isn't as simple as ""showing a bit of skin"", it's the social context surrounding the interaction of social behaviours and idealised body image. It's extraordinarily hard to properly understand the context of such things as the Venus of Willendorf. Given that we've found a number of similar statuettes and we know that later cultures typical depict fertility goddess as rotund figures with pronounced breasts, it does seem reasonable to suggest a link.  Sexualisation, as we understand the term currently, is a way of attributing sexual desirability to body features. This attribution is simultaneously treated negatively and positively - we are taught to desire certain body shapes but yet, paradoxically, we're taught to conceal what we have. This dichotomy is most certainly not continuous throughout history. The Simpsons episode Itchy & Scratchy & Marge highlights this - what we treat as obscene has drastically changed over the centuries. Michelangello's David shows a young man in his prime, bearing his genitalia to the word. Nowadays, showing a humble penis on film or television is the source of significant controversy.  The oldest depiction of sex is perhaps the Turin Erotic Papyrus, Egyptian and roughly 3'000 years old, or the Adonis von Zschernitz, Babylonian and 4'000 years old. The Kama Sutra is also highly relevant here, being 2'000 years old and later Indian architectural designs openly depict hetro-, homo- and bisexuality in all manner of positions and orientations. The Greek writer Philaenis, apparently a courtesan in her day, is recorded as having written a manual on sex and stimulation, although none of her work has survived to the current day, it apparently caused quite a stir.  Pornography, taken its name from the written form, shocked the 19th Century world when it was discovered en masse in the ruins of Pompeii. Prostitution is referred to as ""the oldest profession."" The Code of Hammurabi protects the property rights of women and specifically includes female prostitutes in that legislation. Sacred prostitution, perhaps an extension of fertility rites and worship, is discussed in ancient literature. Sexualisation in the specific sense of ""using people for sex"" goes back a long, long way.  Clearly if there was a market for sex then there must have been objectification and sexualisation. In order to differentiate themselves, prostitutes (sacred or otherwise) will have attempted to accentuate different features of their body to attract the most, or the wealthiest, clients. Cosmetics provide that exact functionality and, interestingly, some cosmetics are older than translatable writing. Egyptians used red ochre as concealer, henna as hair dye and kohl as mascara. In China, fingernails were dyed certain colours depending on your class.  Given the ancient nature of the earliest depictions of large breasts and the difficulty in even dating these statuettes, it is impossible to affix a date or even a period to ""the first sexualisation of breasts"". The use of large breasts as a signifier of fertility is as old as the human species and, presumably, the most fecund woman was the most desirable from the very start."

The US may have been a British colony at one point, but by that time it had been at least 50-100 years; the political, religious, social, and economic contexts were quite different. So I don't think it really works to try to compare the late 19th century in the US, lumped together with 16th-17th century Britain, against the same time periods in Germany and the rest of the continent.   As for Presbyterianism, that was deeply influenced by John Calvin, a Frenchman, and one of his students, John Knox, who then returned to his native Scotland and pretty much ran with his ideas and teachings, to great success.  But anyway, I see this as mainly a historical question, and /r/askhistorians is the right place to ask it.

Did Eskimo / Inuit / northern peoples know there was a warmer climate to the south?  How did people begin to live in cold climates?  Why did humans leave warm or temperate zones and migrate to colder climates?  For what reasons did the ancestors of the Inuit choose to settle in such climates, rather than returning South?

Other proposals include faulty understanding of pre-migration genetics leading to total misunderstanding of the data such that there is no weirdness to explain, or other dismissals of the genetic evidence. An alternative is to dismiss the historical evidence, suggesting that given the paucity of details about early cultures and their borders we may be overestimating the amount of evidence for a migration period in the first place (though I have yet to see anyone go so extreme as to say there's nothing to try to explain).

Taking time off is definitely doable, but it also takes the right kind of person to do it.  You have to be dedicated, flexible, self-motivated, and willing to deal with the possibility that after getting settled into a job for a couple of years you might have to pick up, move, go to grad school, make new friends, etc.  I found it extremely rewarding to take some time off, get some 'real world' work experience, and it gave me motivation to do my Masters.

I'm 47 (and American) and distinctly recall my grandparents during the 70's and 80's sitting in lawn chairs at the entrance to their garage, watching the neighborhood go by and chatting with anyone around. They did this in several houses in several cities in Oregon and California."
AskAnthropology,37e5h6,McWaddle,7,Wed May 27 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"YES - and my grandparents have told us about old stories where people would gather and hang out in their neighborhoods! And this is why it almost feels like there was a transition point, where our culture eliminated this (at least in large cities and their suburbs). I guess it could be the technology, but it just seems interesting. As if there has been a psychological evolution of sorts that has made us, as Americans, not want to interact so closely within our community anymore."

In my neighborhood in the 2000's, people with homes in one particular cul-de-sac would have a huge 4th of July grilling party out on the asphalt. Anyone could join in as long as they brought something to share (beer, soda, whatever).  I'm not like that at all, I'm nowhere near that sociable. I've lived in my current home for four years and have spoken to one next-door neighbor once, and the other not at all.  If I were to guess I would say this sort of focus on community relies primarily on individual personalities and the permanence of the residency. People who are going to live near each other for the majority of their adult lives probably get to know each other more than temporary renters would. It's a lifestyle change; people no longer get a job at 18, buy a house at 20, and stay at both until they retire.  And you're probably right about technology, specifically electronic entertainment.

Many Buddhist and Christian nuns, for example, also wear head coverings some of which quite resemble the Muslim veil. So it isn't just a Muslim thing and even within Muslim societies you'll find a variety of perspectives and attitudes towards whether they veil and if so why. So I think it would be hard to have a blanket statement about women wearing garbs that cover part or all of their head and faces.   You'll also find that most anthropologists don't take hard stances on cultural practices unless it is something quite extreme and a clear and present danger to people's well being. We try to explain and understand more than direct policy-making activities or force cultures to change practices. So I don't think you'll find a good text that is academic from an anthropologist. Of course anthropologists are people with their own personal lives and opinions so perhaps you'll find an individual against veiling who happens to also be an anthropologist."

AskAnthropology,3794zy,BlackMacGyver,21,Mon May 25 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"For quite some time, Kent Flannery's ""Broad Spectrum Revolution"" model (BSR) has been a dominant explanation. In brief, Paleolithic foragers at some point began to incorporate a wider variety of plants and animals into their diets. This was a result of people moving into less hospitable climates with smaller carrying capacities, or climatic changes in areas where people were already living. Wild grasses were part of the BSR. The seed pods or hulls on these grasses typically shattered to spread their seeds around. However, humans tended to eat the non-shattering variety, putting a selective pressure on the grasses. As Flannery argues, this creates a feedback loop where widespread consumption of the grasses confers a greater selective advantage on the non-shattering varieties because people were pooping out the seeds all over the place. Non-shattering pods became dominant and domestication took place. Work at sites in Israel and Turkey are pushing this date for the beginning of gradual domestication back to 20,000+ years ago. Here is an example from work done at Ohalo II in Israel.  Ehud Weiss et al. The Broad Spectrum Revisited: Evidence from Plant Remains. PNAS June 29, 2004 vol. 101 no. 26   http://www.pnas.org/content/101/26/9551.full  However, exceptions to the BSR model have been found, leading some to argue that BSR was actually the result of an abundance, rather than lack of, resources, e.g.:  Melinda A. Zeder. The Broad Spectrum Revolution at 40: Resource diversity, intensification, and an alternative to optimal foraging explanations. Journal of Anthropological Archaeology.

AskAnthropology,3794zy,Snugglerific,3,Tue May 26 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"A complicating factor to this is that seemingly the earliest large, sedentary agricultural community discovered is Abu Hureyra, but the grain varieties recovered from there were not domesticated. Oddly enough it was depopulated during the Younger Dryas, and when its population reemerged it was using domesticated wheat. So seemingly sedentism and planting subsistence both predate domestication.  This doesn't disprove BSR, but it does complicate it. No straight lines, just a very ziggy zaggy path."

Ok that's easy enough.... but your modern context and classifications have got in the way of understanding it, and apparently made my explanation seem misplaced on the surface of things.  In reality most plants are edible. You're coming at the question from the opposite end to how it is approached in the field. It's not so much a matter of looking at some grass and deciding it looks edible, as it is about eating everything you come across and occasionally discovering toxicity.   Even in isolation without cultural knowledge it doesn't take long for a human to put together a lexicon of plant characteristics which will tell them about flavours and compounds present in any specific plant upon visual inspection.  So given that it's not overly risky to try different food resources you start looking for those which return the most reward for time invested, can be stored for later or which give added medicinal or psychoactive benefits.   Seeds fill the storage criteria well. They are also something which can be harvested reliably and with less effort than some other plant parts. Domesticating them and increasing their yield is then just a matter of time, from that first moment when it's still a ""weed"", our eyes grow wide and our stomachs rumble with anticipation of a full belly.  It's good food, like about any plant."
AskAnthropology,3794zy,Mr-Yellow,5,Tue May 26 01:33:21 2015 UTC,"Most grasses contain compounds that upset human stomachs and dog tummies too.  1 in 120 wild wheat plants have a point mutation that makes their seeds non toxic. Eventually they grow in patches.  Apparently other animals like these sweet grasses as well.  Humans like to eat them, especially when ground up into a flour and mixed with water and baked.  Baking stones appear before domestication (and in old Europe, wild tubers are ground up and baked on them, not grasses.  Guns, germs and steel (Jared Diamond) has the citations regarding this."
AskAnthropology,3794zy,Buffalo__Buffalo,4,Tue May 26 05:29:33 2015 UTC,"mixed with water and baked   Yeah I should have touched on that being a prerequisite technology for many seeds. Classic case is Burke and Wills (Australian over-land explorers), a little bit about it in that ""Bush Bread"" link.   They had watched Aboriginal women make Nardoo bread, however they didn't take account of the leaching with water, thinking roasting was the only process needed. This most probably resulted in their death from Vitamin-B1 deficiency (thiaminase poisoning).  Tubers are another classic case, some need roasting, some need leaching and roasting, some can be eaten raw.   The technology being the knowledge that many plants need treating either by roasting or leaching to decrease the toxic compounds. This kind of thing must have entered into our cultural understanding about plant prep techniques pretty early in the piece. Many tribes around the world use Saporin based fish poisons, which also plays into this knowledge (leaching by pounding in streams, same technique as treating for consumption). Once you have this technology then ""most plants are edible"" becomes less hyperbolic.  So we get to a place, still hunter-gatherers, but knowing that seeds and tubers often need treatment before consumption..... Which would then play into our choices of species for further attention and eventual domestication."

AskAnthropology,3794zy,seaharechasr,2,Tue May 26 12:10:58 2015 UTC,"So given that it's not overly risky to try different food resources you start looking for those which return the most reward for time invested, can be stored for later or which give added medicinal or psychoactive benefits.   The problem is that these foods are actually more effort-intensive to gather and/or process compared to other foods in the foragers' diet at the time. One of the reasons BSR was proposed in the first place was to explain this. From the Weiss et al paper (see my comment below):   Flannery's original formulation of the BSR (1) proposed that Paleolithic foragers gradually expanded their resource base to include a broad range of foods that had once been ignored. Several decades of research, primarily on faunal remains, has shown that foragers were indeed casting their nets wider, starting perhaps 50,000 years ago. This research has also shown not only that the new animal foods were taxonomically more diverse than in earlier periods but also that they were more costly in terms of effort to procure (4–6, 46). Whether plant foods went along on this broad-spectrum ride has never been demonstrated for lack of archaeobotanical data. Now with the remarkable collection of plant remains from Ohalo II it is possible to examine the plant component of the Late Paleolithic economy and prove that plant foods were indeed part of the BSR. The assemblage of some 90,000 plant remains shows that wild cereals were gathered at 23,000 cal B.P., pushing back the floral component of the broad-spectrum revolution some 10,000 years earlier than previously suggested. Perhaps more remarkable is the evidence that broad-spectrum foraging was even broader than Flannery originally conceived. In addition to cereals, the foragers of Ohalo II gathered large quantities of more than five different SGG which, like much of the fauna hunted during the Late Paleolithic, were costly to procure compared with the returns."

AskAnthropology,3755m3,Oinkbucket,30,Sun May 24 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Indo-European refers to a language family, i.e. a linguistic grouping. This means that all languages in the family ultimately descend from one ancestral language (just like Spanish, Italian, Romanian, etc. are all descended from Latin). This language has not been attested, but has been reconstructed by linguists. Linguists refer to hypothetical ancestral languages with ""Proto-"" so Proto Indo-European means the non-attested, hypothetical ancestor of all languages in the Indo-European language family. There have been many attempts to connect the linguistic evidence of Proto Indo-European with a material culture observed through archaeological research, and the most dominant hypothesis at the moment is the Kurgan hypothesis. The evidence for this is outlined for a general audience in David Anthony's The Horse, The Wheel and Language.  Researchers from various disciplines have also tried to reconstruct aspects of Indo-European culture, particularly the religion.  The effect of Indo-Europeans impact on history is obviously immense, as nowadays more than 1/3 of the world speaks an Indo-European language, but remember that Indo-European is primarily a linguistic grouping, NOT a cultural one and a lot of what we believe about the culture of Indo-European speakers is highly speculative."

For example, one deity was believed to be *Dyēus Ph_2tēr, translated as ""Sky Father"". If he was a part of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, then he was likely a god related to the sky and was probably the chief deity of the pantheon, attested by the importance of Zeus and Jupiter in the Greek and Roman pantheons (both of which are reflexes of *Dyēus Ph_2tēr in Greek and Latin, respectively), as well as historical roles in equivalent deities in, e.g., the Germanic and Hindu mythologies."

Moving south and east, it entered Persia and Northern India.    There's no disconnection.  Persia (Iran) and India speak Indo-European languages, contiguous with Russia.  Or, almost contiguous.

The earliest mention of kissing has nothing to do with western culture; it's found in the Indian Vedas, dating to 2000 BC - 1500 BC. About a thousand years later, the Hindu Mahabharata mentions kissing as a form of greeting. And the Kama Sutra from about 400 BC describes erotic kissing in great detail. So in terms of attested origin, kissing is an Indian practice, possibly borrowed by the Greeks.  Of course, it may well be that kissing predates written history.

The Eastern European tribespeople who migrated into the Balkans during the early middle ages were vastly outnumbered by the largely Dalmatian-speaking natives. While they asserted their language and culture, they did not replace the original population. A Serbian, a Bosniak, or a Croat today is more genetically similar to a Roman-era Dalamtian than to an East Slavic speaker."
AskAnthropology,375n2t,Vladith,-1,Mon May 25 14:47:37 2015 UTC,"But there are things that do not correlate with this fact. How were the ""vastly outnumbered"" Slavs able to transmit their culture and language on a much larger population, without replacing (or at least modifying) the original population?  Also, there are certain maps like this one and this one that wouldn't support that claim. For example, by those maps, blondism in Italy peaks at 40% only in the extreme north, meanwhile in Croatia it is 40% throughout the whole country, peaking at 50% in the north.  Also, western Balkan countries are quite a bit taller than Italy-than the rest of Europe. The average height in the Dinaric Alps is 185cm for a man, the tallest in Europe at least.  Your claim seems rather debatable, due to obvious differences, such as the facial structure, and overall build that distance western Balkanites (at least Bosniaks) from ""Romans."" Italians tend to have broad shoulders, but remain an average height and tend to be tanner. Bosniaks have very large bone structure, tend to be very tall, and paler.  My question remains- when the Slavs settled in the Balkan peninsula, how much changing/modifying was done? Some sources say they made the Illyrians flee upon arrival, others say they assimilated them. There has been no concrete answer I have found.  However, I'm still leaning towards the side that Slavs from which Bosniaks, some Croats, and Ukrainians descend from, remained relatively pure through history, with some mixing here or there."
AskAnthropology,375n2t,Vladith,5,Mon May 25 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"Again, you don't get it.  There were underlying genetic differences between the Balkans and Italy going back millenia, since before either Latin or Slavic existed. It's possible that Croatia is more blonde than Italy due to Slavic admixture, but more likely is that there were genetic differences prior to the Slavicization of the Balkans. The Welsh are slightly darker-haired than the Irish on average, for instance. When two populations are separated (such as by the Irish Sea or by the Slovene Alps), different combinations of traits occur. This is why blonde hair is more common in Finland than in Estonia, for instance.    And it's no wonder that Italians and Balkan people look very different from each other, because they're two different populations. Lebanese people and Yemeni people look quite different from each other, despite both groups being Arabs. Fifteen hundred years ago, the people of Lebanon would have likely identified as Romans and when the people of Yemen would have identified as Sabeans. The Arab conquest transformed both of their cultures without heavily transforming the gene pool. Similarly, the Slavic conquest of the Balkans and of Poland turned both populations into Slavs without heavily changing the existing gene pools. The Dalmatian people were not Italians, but instead Balkan Romans who spoke a language similar to Italian. If you met a Dalmatian person today, you might assume they were a Croat or a Bosniak speaking a strange form of Italian.  Conquering groups very often spread their language, even if they are the minority. The Anglo-Saxons did it in Britain and the Arabs did it in the Middle East and North Africa. When a group is in charge, it becomes practical for other people to learn their language. Otherwise they cannot communicate with them and obtain higher status. In addition, marrying into local families leads to lots of children speaking the new dominant language. In cases when a conqueror's language does not become dominant (such as the Germans in Italy, the Vandals in North Africa, or the Yuan Dynasty of China), it's because after several generations the ruling class lost their own identity and took on the local language. It's very difficult to rule a country if you don't speak the same language as the people.  And there is no such thing as ""purity"". Every group is mixed and descended from another group."
AskAnthropology,375n2t,Vladith,1 point,Tue May 26 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"First you say that the Slavic conquest of the Balkans assimilated only culture and language, then go on to say that those same Slavic conquests transformed the gene pool but only a little bit?  How could these genetic differences between the Italians and Dalmatians have been so large as to equate for the differences found in between the western Balkanites and Italians? The appearance of the Western Southern Slavs today (excluding the Central and Southern Serbians, Slovenes) does not correlate with how the Dalmatians even could look like.   The Dalmatians you're referring to, stem from a tribe called the Dalmatae. They were proto-southern Indo-Europeans who spoke an Illyrian language, completely unrelated to Italian or Latin. When the Slavs settled in Dalmatia from Western Ukraine some odd 1500 years ago, they remained the dominant ethnic group there. It wasn't the Slavs who assimilated their language, they just replaced (or at least very heavily overwhelmed) the ethnic Dalmatian population, it was the dalmatians who gave loan words and historical terms to the Slavs. ""Dalmatia"", in Croatian ""Dalmacija"", is an Illyrian word that is cognate with the Albanian ""Delme"", meaning sheep.  Obviously ethnic purity exists nowhere, the closest thing to that exists only in very isolated areas like the Aboriginal tribes of Australia. There was obviously mixing done with the Slavs who settled in and around Dalmatia, but the early Balkanic tribes living there played a minimal role in this , and more likely Central European influences, like Hungary, Austria, Germany and even Great Moravia, played an influence in mixing.  What still remains a mystery to me is how the settling occurred. As I said before, some sources say that the Southern Proto-Indo-Europeans fled upon arrival of the Slavs, meanwhile others say the small populace remained with the dominant Slavic population until they were assimilated completely, meaning their language, culture, genetics, and religion, were all replaced by the Early Slavs. It also doesn't add up to any of the facts claiming that the I Haplogroup is attributed to Slavs mixing with paleo-balkanites, as in Northern Europe, Scandinavians (whose predominant Haplogroup is I) bear very close genetic resemblance to Germans, who belong to Haplogroup R1b. This theory also isn't consistent with the fact that Czechs have a very high R1a haplogroup%, yet they settled to areas that were under heavy Gothic and Celtic influence that, once again, belong to the R1b haplogroup. The R1a haplogroup itself is often incorrectly attributed to being a 'Slavic marker', when Hungarians, who are themselves Tatars, have a strong percentage of this haplogroup.  I'm still trying to figure out how much of a difference in genetic relatedness haplogroups make, and I'm not quite sure what to think or where to even start looking."
AskAnthropology,375n2t,Vladith,3,Tue May 26 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"I never said that no genetic change happened! Every conquest involves some genetic change. But the genetic change was small. There may be Bosniak people with no detectable Eastern European/Russian ancestry, but they're still absolutely Slavic, because the Slavic identity isn't genetic, but cultural and linguistic.  By the time of the Slavic conquest, the indigenous Illyrian languages were dying or dead. People of the Balkans spoke the Dalmatian language, which is based off of Latin in the same way that Romanian and French are. What sources say that the Dalmatian people fled? What sources say Slavs were the majority? If this was the case, the Balkans would be genetically closer to modern Russia than to other parts of Southeastern Europe, but this is not the case. It is logistically impossible to imagine the millions of Dalmatian people fleeing the Balkans en masse, and such an enormous migration would be represented in the archaeological record. It isn't.  And native Australians weren't ethnically pure. If you were to find a full-blooded Aboriginal person, and somehow meet all of their ancestors, you would not be able to pinpoint where the African people ended and where the Australian people began. The same is true of all humans. Traits specific to a group develop over time, and populations are constantly changing even without the introduction of outside genes.   Lastly, I'd advise you to do a lot of reading into haplotypes before trying to prove anything. R1b and R1a are Y-chromosomal, meaning they only represent genes transferred through the paternal line. This is very important, because in instances of conquest we often see very different male and female lines.   You must also keep in mind that huge amounts of prehistoric migrations occurred. These left an enormous impact on human genetics despite not being recorded. Because the population of Europe was comparatively small in 12,000 BC, a migration from the Middle East to Italy during that time of just a few hundred people would have a much bigger impact than a migration of the same size in 200 AD."
AskAnthropology,375n2t,SmallSubBot,-2,Tue May 26 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"If this was the case, the Balkans would be genetically closer to modern Russia than to other parts of Southeastern Europe, but this is not the case   Under ""related ethnic groups"" here does it say that the related ethnic groups to Bosniaks and South Slavs are the Slavic people only. This does not go by ethnic origin but rather genetic similarity, as the related ethnic groups of the Romanians states that the Romanians are not only related to their direct descendants, but to those surrounding ethnic groups they mixed with through history-which was enough to make a significant difference in the gene pool.  All South Slavs only have small things in common with the East Slavs: The staples of Slavic culture like Easter Eggs, some common religious traditions (which are also shared among non-Slavs), and very few folklore stories (Baba Yaga being the only one to my knowledge). There is no South Slavic nation (Except for some parts of Croatia) that would have anything else in common with the East Slavs, and any cultural commonalities are from the grace of the Ottoman empire ruling over half eastern Europe for a few hundred years.  South Slavic culture, excluding Slovenian and Croatian culture, is not ""Slavic"" in any way, it's Western Asian or Middle Eastern. Slovenian and West Slavic culture (excluding eastern Poland) is German or Austrian. Croatian culture is heterogeneous to a great degree, having commonalities with Central, Western and Southern Europe. The remaining cultures (East Slavic and Eastern Poland) could be culturally categorized as true ""Slavic Culture.""  The only thing remaining then, if not culture, religion or genetics, is language, in which case all Slavic countries (to greater and lesser extents) are very similar to each other.  However, I find it kind of a stretch that cartographers, genealogists and anthropologists would categorize certain countries as ""Slavic"" based solely off their language or culture, because then, Kazakhstan and Kosovo could be Slavic nations, as they have culture and language that is shared or that is similar with other Slavic countries.  You are making some good points, but perhaps as a Slav this information does not add up in my head."
AskAnthropology,374s18,Yonyod,3,Sun May 24 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"So far as I know, there are no written descriptions of Buddha's appearance until long after his death. So it would be hard to establish what he looked like.  However, there are several misconceptions in your question. I'll address a couple.  First, Buddha was not a Brahmin. He was a prince, the son of a king, and therefore would have belonged to the kshatriya caste. Brahmins were priests, kshatriyas were kings and warriors.  Second, the whole idea of the Indo-European ""conquest"" of India is discredited nonsense from the 19th century. There has been intermixing of people between India and west/central Asia since long before there were any Indo-Europeans. Beginning with the spread of agriculture in the neolithic, there were farmers from central Asia and the middle east established across northwestern India and Pakistan. In the millenia that followed, there continued to be large scale movements of people between India and parts west of it.  The genetics of north India were well established by the time of the Indo-European migrations. Most anthropologists now believe that the Indo-European ""conquest"" was a trickle of people arriving in India over an extended period, of about a thousand years. Their contribution to the Indian gene pool is relatively minor. Most of the haplogroups shared between India and western Asia have convergence dates long before the Indo-European migrations, meaning they already existed in India when the Indo-European speakers arrived. There is absolutely no archeological evidence of any ""conquest"", simply one of people intermixing with the existing populations.  All of this has little to do with Buddha. His birth date is approximately 500 BC. The Indo-European migrations began 1500 years before his birth. The spread of neolithic people from central and west Asia to India happened 5000 years before his birth.  Third, the idea of Indo-Europeans resembling modern Ukrainians is nonsense. Indo-European is not a racial or national group, it's a linguistic and cultural group. There is absolutely no evidence that Indo-Europeans looked like Ukrainians, or even that they were physically homogenous. From what we know about them, chances are that they were a diverse group, coming in all colors and shades and physiognomies. What they had in common was an ancestral language, and some similarities in their culture, such as the use of the horse, painted grey ware, kurgan-type burials. The Indo-Europeans who arrived in India did not have Ukrainian origins, they were from Persia and the middle east."

I don't understand this though:   Third, the idea of Indo-Europeans resembling modern Ukrainians is nonsense.   If they lived there, why would they not look similar? Have the genetics of the region changed much?"
AskAnthropology,374s18,EvanRWT,2,Sat May 30 03:19:13 2015 UTC,"If they lived there, why would they not look similar? Have the genetics of the region changed much?   Well, it's been 5,000 years, so of course the genetics of the region have changed. The huge Slav migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries did not leave Ukraine untouched, not to mention the 4,000 years before that.  But that isn't what I meant. I meant that the original PIE speakers never entered India, or in fact 90% of the region where Indo-European languages are spoken today. This is because the Indo-European people were not homogenous - they were a collection of many tribes and peoples of different origins and races and genetics. The particular people who entered India during the Indo-European migrations were not from Ukraine, but from east of the Caspian Sea, what is today Central Asia - Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and also from Iran.  The theory is that the original homeland of the proto-Indo-European (PIE) speakers was the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, which is the region between the Black and Caspian Seas, and north of it. This includes what is today eastern Ukraine, but it also includes Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and parts of Russia. There were no national boundaries 5,000 years ago: the boundary was geographical, meaning the extent of the steppe and the lifestyle it supported, rather than the forest and taiga around it.  This region was home to many tribes, probably numbering in the hundreds. They did not all have the same genetics, but they did share the same language, and certain technology and cultural practices. They were a mobile people, using horses for travel, so these tribes had been in constant contact with each other for a while. This is why they shared similarities in language and culture. But there is no evidence that they were genetically homogenous. In fact it would be stretching the bounds of credibility to think that such a huge area could be genetically homogenous. It has never happened anywhere in the world that we know of, until relatively recent times.  The Indo-European speakers in India arrived from the eastern part of the steppe, which is those central Asian republics I mentioned. Genetically, Indo-European signatures in the Indian population genome are much closer to Central Asia than to the Ukraine. As cultures on their periphery became assimilated into the PIE language subgroups, these peripheral people pushed further outwards into new lands. And as the people there became assimilated, they in turn pushed further outwards. This happened as a trickle over 3,000 years. This is why there are so many different PIE languages today, because they existed over a large region that was sufficiently diverse and sufficiently insulated from other PIE regions elsewhere that it could develop its own dialect which eventually became a separate language.  The actual Indo-Europeans in India arrived from Central Asia and Iran. By this time, the PIE languages had already split and developed large differences. Indian PIE languages resemble Iranian the most (hence belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European tree).  However, like I said, there are a couple of things to remember. First, these IE speakers were not entering an area completely new to them. In fact, people from Iran, the middle east (which is where Ukrainians are from, if you go far back enough in time), and Central Asia had been entering India for many thousands of years before the IE people arrived. The neolithic migrations of farmers were probably a hundred times larger in numbers than the IE people. So the north Indian genetics had already been established a long time before IE speakers arrived. In terms of genetic contribution, they IE people did not add or change a whole lot to India.  Second, the idea of a ""conquest"" is pretty ridiculous. The migration was spread over a period of a thousand years. In numbers, it was a tiny tiny trickle over a very long period of time. The plains of the Indus-Saraswati basin were densely populated, and this region probably held more people than the entire PIE region outside India. The Indus Valley Civilization (which was larger than both ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia combined) was nearing its end, when the region started drying up and the Saraswati stopped flowing.  The oldest IE literature from India (the Vedas) mention nothing of any conquest, or of arrival from elsewhere, or any fighting or conquest. Instead, the Vedas indicate that these people were already living there, that this was their homeland. The oldest of them, the Rig Veda, is from about 1800 BC, the beginning of the IE migration into India. It is probably even older, since it mentions the Saraswati river, which we know via archeology dried up around 2,000 BC. So here is a book that talks about a people living by the banks of the Saraswati, who have always lived here. Except that it's written in an IE language that we know couldn't have arrived in India prior to about 2,000 BC.  The obvious conclusion is that IE speakers were thoroughly assimilated with the local populations, that they were part of the local culture. They thought they had lived there forever. This is evident in many things, including the language itself. While Sanskrit is an IE language, it borrows hugely from native Indian languages, including Dravidian languages. Vedic culture has huge local elements, from many gods of the Indus people to cultural practices that were uniquely Indian and never part of the PIE people elsewhere.  So probably what we see is that IE people arriving over a very long period assimilated into the local culture and became part of it. The Vedas were composed some time after their arrival. We know this because textually, they correspond to a period of about 1500 BC (for the oldest, the Rig Veda), but content-wise, they talk of a much earlier period, when the Saraswati was still flowing (which has to be around 2,000 BC at the latest). The reason why the language is IE rather than some local Indian language is probably because their composition coincides with the collapse of the Indus Valley due to drought, when the population was moving to the Gangetic plain, as the center of Indian civilization moved east. At this time, it's quite possible that as later bands of IE speakers kept trickling in, they found themselves among previous IE arrivals, who spoke the same IE language, but were writing about an older culture which thrived when the Saraswati was still flowing."

AskAnthropology,3713u4,chocolatepot,2,Mon May 25 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Supreme Court came to that conclusion in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 569-70 (2003).  Here is the relevant passage from the opinion:   Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault. As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, supra, at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy. Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals. To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private. Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice. A partner's testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent. See, e.g., F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880). The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions. In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults."

The mother raised him alone and worked and never bothered to learn to sign. At best they had something called ""homesign"" which is a made-up language between the deaf person and someone in their family. No one outside of them can understand it and it is rudimentary at best. She never wanted him to go to a deaf institute, thinking it had some sort of stigma, but eventually relented to. It was only then that he learned proper ASL.  You'd be surprised how many families of deaf people don't learn sign. Some told me how there would be big family gatherings on holidays and the most anyone would do is wave at them from the table and mouth words they couldn't understand.

Basically, the idea is that we, humans, are born with a very basic, rudimentary, innate understanding of grammar. This is because a fetus doesn't know into which culture it will be born, so it needs to be able to learn any language and interpersonal communication styles.   It is likely, then, that people without vocal language still have a thinking pattern similar to those with vocal language because of the underlying competences that allow for language acquisition.  Edit:  ""Thinking"" tends to be symbolic. Language is similarly symbolic. I would guess that Deaf people would utilize other symbolic tools (written language and symbols (e.g. heart = love)) in a similar way we utilize language to think.  Also, ""thinking"" is super hard to define. It contains a lot of different aspects that are not well understood, so understanding ""thinking"" broadly is even more difficult.

The only thing I can offer is a vague speculation based on others' speculations. Jerry Fodor posited a ""language of thought,"" (LOT) or ""mentalese,"" that is pre-linguistic. In Fodor's conception, mentalese is structured syntactically, like language.   Disregarding criticisms of LOT, let's say there is some kind of mentalese. It doesn't necessarily have to be what Fodor says it is -- the details could be different entirely. Some kind of mentalese must have existed prior to language, unless we want to deny consciousness to early hominins (very unlikely). What did this early form of mentalese consist of? We have no idea. Maybe imagery was primary, maybe episodic memory, maybe some kind of body language, maybe a mix of all of these, or something else entirely?

So if language X controls the wealth in a geographical area it is difficult to gain access to it unless new wealth is discovered or imported since you must speak X to access existing wealth.

AskAnthropology,36v9yg,THHUXLEY,7,Fri May 22 13:44:22 2015 UTC,I think you are using language as a synonym for ethnicity which is ok since they are strongly correlated but not 1:1.

AskAnthropology,36v9yg,firedrops,2,Fri May 22 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"This is a very complex issue but one that has been studied in a number of contexts. I don't necessarily have an answer for you as a clear path to improving things but perhaps some scholarship and terms might help you find models.    Diglossia: Two or more varieties of a language that coexist in a speech community and which are each used in different contexts and are ranked hierarchically. There is usually a high and a low and status can be performed through language choice.  Linguistic Market: Bourdieu’s concept that language exchanges enact relationships of power and linguistic competence reflects power status. But for competence with the elite language to retain value then access to the market must be protected. In other words, you have to patroll those borders to ensure people of lower status don't gain competency in the language of power.  An Example: In Haiti, Michel DeGraff argues that the divide between French and Kreyol speakers is akin to a language apartheid because it prevents the poor from accessing power, education, and bettering their condition. If you want to mail something, get a bank loan, read a newspaper, run for governmental office, etc. you need French competency, which most poor Haitians don't have beyond perhaps a 1st grade level. See: DeGraff, Michel""Creole Exceptionalism and the (Mis) Education of the Creole Speaker."" The languages of Africa and the diaspora: educating for language awareness 12 (2009): 124. However, the language of the disenfranchised can be a linguistic black market – Labov’s idea of “covert prestige”. For example, if you think about the cultural performance of street smarts and being ""real"" through language that can prove reputation. This can lead to a reputation vs respectability dynamic where respectability is attaining and improving status through hegemonic social normative pathways - college degrees, grammar & linguistic cues of the powerful class, white collar jobs, etc. Reputation gains status in part by thumbing their nose at respectability. It is resistance but it is often limited in power unless there is a revolution because while it carves out a space of seeming autonomy it denies access to the real realms of power. People also may feel ethnic cultural ties with language as tradition and identity, which they want to preserve.   There can often be a language elitism that occurs so perhaps an argument that all languages are capable of conveying the same concepts just as well as others (i.e. they aren't equal in complexity but they can all translate a Chemistry book or Shakespeare and get at the same ideas even if they have to use more or less words and explanations.) In Haiti, people like Trouillot have argued that Kreyol is literally incapable of conveying complex and high education level concepts which of course then suggests peasants are incapable of thinking these things. If you find a similar line of arguing in Canada perhaps a modern version of linguistic relativity would be beneficial. But I'd suggest bilingual rather than shift to one or the other is probably going to be the easiest sell. But this isn't my area of expertise. It is very complicated and wrapped up with high stakes concerns like ethnicity, class, power, and identity."
AskAnthropology,36v9yg,Lucamiro,2,Sat May 23 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this post. In a country where more than one language is used, uneven distribution of wealth I believe is a given since different geographical areas have different resources and those with a common language tend to associate more closely. Of course, like you pointed out, derivations of a language can also lead to an uneven distribution of wealth among its populace.  South Africa has a big obstacle the country must deal which is the language barrier. Only 1/3 of the country speaks English and those who speak Xhosa, for example, or Afrikaans, are significantly poorer than the English speakers. This can be further broken down into subsets where the ""proper"" use language people tend to be wealthier.   In the Dominican Republic, there are many Haitians who live there but fewer than 10% speak Spanish, resulting in lack of opportunity and access to markets. This problem was exacerbated after the earthquake in 2010 caused an influx of refugees with no Spanish language background.   So it seems that in countries where more than one language is commonly used, the problems are bifurcated and income inequality may exist within a common trade language and between trade languages."

The sciences seems to discourage it far less, and so PI's are more likely to extend co-authorship to others. I've heard that when a search (or tenure) committee sees a bunch of papers on a CV with a lot of co-authors, they basically rank them as less valuable since they can't really determine the extent of the applicant's contribution. Interdisciplinary research is similarly punished since the papers sometimes land in journals that straddle disciplines and the search/tenure committee is often unfamiliar with their impact rankings....or their impact factors are just less impressive (basically nil) since they can be really niche, which, of course, has nothing to do with the quality of scholarship contained therein.

It's ok to read Durkiem, Weber, Marx or to take a class in geology or biology but suggest a research program that crosses modern disciplinary boundaries and you are looked down on.

What I mean is, if a physicist presents a thesis or an experiment, others can easily (relatively speaking) verify the results, mathematically or experimentally, and thus judge it. Whereas in anthropology, any given thesis is more vulnerable to bias and/or interpretation, and as such the author (or the source if you will) carries a heavier weight? An already well-regarded author will be less likely to have his new theses dismissed due to his/her pre-existing authority. Ultimately leading to prestige as a proxy for authority, and making that something to not ""dilute"" by sharing?

Part of the problem is that replicating studies is expensive and leads to 0 prestige (it just doesn't sparkle like pioneering research). Prestige in science is also why there's such massive pressure to produce positive results. Nature doesn't want to publish your paper on how you bred 300 generations of drosophila and scrutinized them fruitlessly until your funding ran out.    An already well-regarded author will be less likely to have his new theses dismissed due to his/her pre-existing authority. Ultimately leading to prestige as a proxy for authority, and making that something to not ""dilute"" by sharing?   these big name people aren't the ones who are worried about publishing something that's not a real super duper home run. They probably have tenure and sit on the search/tenure committees. Then again, sometimes their reputation can get them deals with good academic presses.   Honestly, I think co-authorship in the natural sciences just comes down to how labs operate (and are funded) and that it probably works better to delegate tasks and give credit.   Also, writing ethnography is kind of an individual effort (the irony). Read something by Michael Jackson (I'd recommend https://www.dukeupress.edu/At-Home-in-the-World/index-viewby=title.html ) ;  his writing is so multi-sensory--filled with sights, sounds, flavours, smells, tastes, and wonderful stylistic embellishments.

You've probably read her Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: http://www.jstor.org/stable/656537"
AskAnthropology,36qhxp,nagCopaleen,2,Thu May 21 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input! Yes, this is the article I have been trying to discuss in my essay. I am not sure of what you meant about 'the veil and dress are not the same free choice'. Could I ask you to elaborate a bit? Does not Mahmood claim that the muslim woman veil herself because she has agency and wants to be a good muslim?"
AskAnthropology,36qhxp,masungura,7,Thu May 21 13:03:42 2015 UTC,"I'll quote from the article. For those who haven't read it, Mahmood is discussing an Islamic women's ""mosque movement,"" in which women promote Islamic virtues (notably shyness/modesty/wearing the veil) that challenge the assumptions of feminist scholarship. In some cases these women are well-educated and pursuing this against the desires of male friends and relatives. I'm going over this because I want to stress this is based in specific ethnographic work. If you want to discuss the general impact of the burqa etc., post your own response or reply to terist's.   When women's actions seem to reinscribe what appear to be ""instruments of their own oppression,"" the social analyst can point to moments of disruption of (male authority.) Agency, in this form of the analysis, is understood as the capacity to realize one's own interests against the weight of custom  (...) What is seldom problematized in such an analysis is the universality of desire — central for liberal and progressive thought, and presupposed by the concept of resistance it authorizes — to be free from relations of subordination and, for women, from structures of male domination. (...) freedom is normative to feminism: critical scrutiny is applied to those who want to limit women's freedom rather than those who want to extend it.  (...) In order for an individual to be free, it is required that her actions be the consequence of her ""own will"" rather than of custom, tradition, or direct coercion.   Mahmood explicitly challenges the universality of ""agency"" as defined above. The women Mahmood studied do not say they are making the choice of their own free will. To varying degrees, they consider it a religious/moral requirement to adopt these customs, regardless of whether they serve the woman's self-interest. This is a fundamentally different motivation than the typical narrative of female agency and resistance.  I would leave the ""red dress"" comparison out of your paper. Even if you disagree with Mahmood's interpretation, the veil is definitely not a fashion statement. A more political Western female action would be a better point of comparison and contrast."

AskAnthropology,36qhxp,not-claudius,4,Fri May 22 11:02:22 2015 UTC,"the (surprisingly Not Uncommon) claim that women in the middle east / islamic cultures are Not Oppressed has always sounded like pure sophistry to me.  the notion that women in the middle east wearing burqas/hijabs/veils/whatever represents a ""free choice"" on their part is completely ridiculous on its face. It makes a complete mockery of the concept of choice that wouldn't pass muster for a single second if applied to feminist topics du jour in the west.  Let's try it. Women in the west ""choose"" to wear sexy clothing, ""choose"" to shave their legs & arms, ""choose"" to cope with all sorts of alleged sex-based discrimination/abuse, and ""choose"" to work at jobs where they are purportedly making less money than men would -- after all, they have the 'choice' between doing all this or simply Never Leaving The House. Thus, as all feminists would surely agree, women in the west are not oppressed, they're simply exercising their free choices to do these things!  Well, not quite. The standard western feminist tack on all this is that the above ""choices"" are simply expedient coping responses to the nonetheless unjust impositions put upon them by the allegedly ""patriarchal"" forces of western society. In other words, the mere observation that women tend to live their lives while putting up with these situations doesn't at all mitigate the notion that they are being coerced into doing so by some ambient societal power structure. (At least, so say the feminists. And if you buy into the truth of the premises -- that these behaviors are being brought about by latent societal coercion, and therefore are by definition forms of oppression -- then the logic behind the conclusion is certainly sound enough.)  Of course, you can say what you want to about the extent of patriarchal pressures in the west, but I think (I hope?) that we can still agree that whatever those pressures might be, even in the worst case scenario they still pale pretty profoundly in comparison to the compulsory forces behind the enforcement of religious dress codes in the middle east.  So all this is to say that I have no idea how anyone could possibly square the claims that a woman is exercising a free choice when she dons a burqa to avoid facing ostracism and/or physical harm, but that a western woman is not exercising a completely free choice when she shaves her legs to avoid some potential negative social attention. You can't have it both ways -- at least not without some tortuously sophistic mental logic where the threat of physical harm is somehow less ""oppressive"" or damaging to free personal choice than, say, the risk of Getting Dirty Looks From Your Coworkers is.    IMO, the fact that this kind of sophistry is nonetheless extremely prevalent among leftist (/academics) today is an inevitable consequence of the underlying fact that the twin progressive ideals of Multiculturalism and Feminism are inherently at complete odds with each other when it comes to certain topics like islam / the middle east. But since progressives are extremely averse to letting go of either of those ideals as an Absolute Value, their only remaining intellectual option is to resort to bizarre academic games of language and relativism to attempt to square them."

Chimps and pre-humans surely behave this way in a much more automatic sense (as birds making their nests).

No culture is 100% egalitarian nor is any 100% structured by social or economic class. Not only does every culture fall on a continuum at any point, their position on that continuum is ever changing as well.   The other important thing to remember is that the scale of analysis is important. A farming community might be class based on the macro scale but egalitarian on the family unit scale.   Its useful to think of this continuum when thinking of all cultural traits, gender roles, age systems, economic or political structures.   Food storage is common among all hunter gatherers and is found in the archaeological record in nearly all times and across the world. Some types of storage may correlate with social stratification but the two things are likely weakly correlated."
AskAnthropology,36jkjm,THHUXLEY,1 point,Wed May 20 21:52:06 2015 UTC,Bands vs tribes?  Bands are small groups where sharing meat can be required. And everyone is part of the group. You make decisions by discussing things and convincing the majority. As in The Old Way.  While tribes and agriculture is family centred as the groups are too big. Crops means that you have personal belongings and land. And trade with crops etc. demands structure and society. No decision can be made by just talking things over as the group is too big for it. So leaders will emerge here. As in Yanomamo - Chagnon
AskAnthropology,36i1jp,diporasidi,16,Tue May 19 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Homer has been a cultural touchstone in the West for two and a half mellenia, but the actual values articulated in it are more the result of the people interpreting it than the text itself. For example, the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is never defined in the text and there is no direct or even really indirect suggestion that it was sexual (or that it wasn't!). Thus, in Classical Greece they were interpreted as an example of eramenos/erastes, which was a strictly hierarchical relation between an adult and an adolescent male. In later periods readers interpreted their relationship as one between comrades and deep friends without sexual overtones. Today, many readers see them as homosexual lovers. These are three quite incompatible views of the same relationship.  Or even more broadly, today Homer is often stressed for its depiction of the mindless brutality of war, and I remember in my undergrad literature class some even came away with the idea that it was fundamentally anti-war. This is rather different from the view Alexander the Great had of it!"

The split side is that you can't understand anything cultural without having some understanding of your own culture, even though your culture may be full of myths and prejudices and so on. Can you, as a Westerner, understand Chinese culture without understanding Classical Greece? Sure, but you will understand it better if you understand where Western reports about Chinese culture draws its prejudices from. You learn to see bias.

It's a critique of Enlightenment and 'western civilisation', but it makes a good link and analysis between classics and modernity."
AskAnthropology,36i1jp,mosestrod,3,Fri May 22 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"A quote from that chapter I always liked:  The way of civilization has been that of obedience and work, over which fulfilment shines everlastingly as mere illusion, as beauty deprived of power. Odysseus’s idea, equally inimical to his death and to his happiness, shows awareness of this. He knows only two possibilities of escape. One he pre- scribes to his comrades. He plugs their ears with wax and orders them to row with all their might. Anyone who wishes to survive must not listen to the temptation of the irrecoverable, and is unable to listen only if he is unable to hear. Society has always made sure that this was the case. Workers must look ahead with alert concentration and ignore anything which lies to one side. The urge toward distraction must be grimly sublimated in redoubled exertions. Thus the workers are made practical. The other possibility Odysseus chooses for himself, the landowner, who has others to work for him. He listens, but does so while bound helplessly to the mast, and the stronger the allurement grows the more tightly he has himself bound, just as later the bourgeois denied themselves happiness the closer it drew to them with the increase in their own power. What he hears has no consequences for him; he can signal to his men to untie him only by movements of his head, but it is too late. His comrades, who themselves cannot hear, know only of the danger of the song, not of its beauty, and leave him tied to the mast to save both him and themselves. They reproduce the life of the oppressor as a part of their own, while he cannot step outside his social role. The bonds by which he has irrevocably fettered himself to praxis at the same time keep the Sirens at a distance from praxis: their lure is neutralized as a mere object of contemplation, as art.  it should be obvious the authors are making a deeper connection between this 'classic' and 'western civilisation'. It isn't as simply as they borrowed ideas"

Archaeological examination of some roman mass graves at the site seems to support this.  From Tacitus (first link):   Varus' first camp with its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly indicated the handiwork of three legions. Further on, the partially fallen rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position. In the center of the field were the whitening bones of men, as they had fled, or stood their ground, strewn everywhere or piled in heaps. Near lay fragments of weapons and limbs of horses, and also human heads, prominently nailed to trunks of trees.

If you want academic references let me know.   Here are some examples of ways we can discern architecture in the absence of the actual architecture;  1) on the plains we sometimes find bone uprights which have been interpreted as pegs used to hold down skin tents. A few sites have a series of these allowing us to estimate tent size and shape even though there is no remains of the actual structure,  2) similarly post molds can provide the same information on where wood poles once stood even when the wood itself is long decayed,  3) finally the spatial analysis of archaeological remains tell us a lot about housing structure and use. On the Northern Plains, the spatial pattering of remains (e.g, bone concentrations on one side of a hearth and lithics on the other) match ethnographic records of First Nations tent use and social structure. This allows is to deduce the size of the structure and even the social stratification of space within it for sites which are thousands of years old and for which no architectural structure remain."

What defines capitalism is to treat the means of economic production as capital, which implies selling commodities for a value greater than their production cost in order to invest the difference back into perpetually expanding one's capital. The element that has allowed capital expansion to become a self-reproducing system of production, as opposed to a momentary spurt of price-gouging or appropriation or conquest, is to treat human labor power itself primarily as a commodity and to systematically compensate it at a lower value than the value it adds to the productive process. Historically speaking, even the most robust systems of trade without this key element have tended to run out of ways to expand fairly quickly."

I knew the wavelengths are an oversimplification of something very subjective, but I wanted to add them because I thought it might make it clearer or easier to understand why it was a flawed metaphor.

AskAnthropology,36d0bm,fforde,19,Mon May 18 14:09:27 2015 UTC,That's a terrible analogy as I was talking about the supernatural and you are talking about the natural world.   One is based on evidence the other faith. When your belief is based on faith it's ludicrous to think you are correct and all other faiths are incorrect.   You are by definition believing in spite of evidence.
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,WallyMetropolis,-10,Tue May 19 09:52:17 2015 UTC,"But your argument wasn't about the nature of faith or something like that. It was entirely an argument about the existence of other, conflicting beliefs throughout history.   Your second sentence here is making a different argument. And it really has more to do with epistemology than anthropology, doesn't it?    You are by definition believing in spite of evidence.   I am not doing anything of the sort. As an anthropologist, you maybe should be more careful with pronouns."
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,thehonorablechairman,8,Thu Jul 2 00:23:29 2015 UTC,Obviously the you in my sentence is general and not specific.   The point of my post was that since all faiths have no factual basis believing in the truth of one over another is ludicrous. It's like believing Walter White is more real than Catain Kirk.
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,WallyMetropolis,2,Mon May 18 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"But that's different from what you originally said. Thank you for clarifying.   I would disagree with this also, however. Unless you believe that having philosophical beliefs about things like epistemology itself for example is also ludicrous. After all, there is no factual basis for something like the law of non-contradiction. Or metaphysics. There's no factual basis that underpins a belief that things in the world exist outside of my perception. Is it therefore ludicrous if you think your chair exists?"
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,reginhild,5,Mon May 18 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"Modern medicine tends to have the backing of the scientific method and the peer review process unlike religion, terrible analogy."
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,THHUXLEY,-7,Mon May 18 17:42:29 2015 UTC,That is a different argument. We aren't talking about using evidentiary reasoning. The thing I am refuting is the claim that others having conflicting beliefs through history should at all be evidence against my beliefs.
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,gamegyro56,9,Mon May 18 17:49:42 2015 UTC,Yes I understood that. I am saying the analogy you used doesn't work because the 'beliefs' of modern medicine are evidence based whereas your religious beliefs are faith based and thus cannot be disproven. The scenarios are in no way equivalent.
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,THHUXLEY,-3,Mon May 18 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"It's unconvincing to me to claim that you understand my point when, in the following sentence, you continue to talk about something that I am explicitly saying isn't my point.   I'm not arguing against any of the conclusions that have been made. Just against the particular argument. There was no argument made about the value of evidence. That is a fine argument. The argument that was made was: ""other people have thought other things, so what's the chance that you're right?"" And that is not a good argument."
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,nagCopaleen,4,Mon May 18 17:58:06 2015 UTC,The fact that other people have thought other things is evidence.
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,THHUXLEY,-5,Mon May 18 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. But it's not strong enough evidence to, on its own, suggest that believing something is ludicrous. Otherwise, you'd have to argue that having any belief at all is ludicrous."
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,reginhild,3,Mon May 18 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Otherwise, you'd have to argue that having any belief at all is ludicrous.   Many people would agree if you restrict that statement to beliefs without evidence, based only on faith."
AskAnthropology,36d0bm,nagCopaleen,-2,Mon May 18 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"But, again, the argument I am referring to was not an argument about evidence. You are trying to defend the original conclusion by making different arguments. That's fine, but it's not at all a refutation of what I am saying. Because I'm not trying to refute the conclusion. I am simply saying that the original argument, as stated, is a poor one."

Of course you can find something that refers to ""Conflict"", ""Etiquette"", ""Childbirth customs"", and ""Trade"" in any culture, but the examples in one culture might horrify or confuse participants in the second.  Similar terms such as ""Marriage"" and ""Property"" belong to this group as well, but describe practices so diverse that many anthropologists would argue they shouldn't be lumped together.

They have radically different ideas about how people should act and radically different reasons for those prescriptions. And that's just two groups that come from the same broad family of faiths and originated in fairly nearby parts of the world only a few centuries apart.

So why? So that consumers can eat an aesthetically pleasing, mealy, flavorless tomato in December? Or is there another reason that I've missed?   Your argument seems to be that genes are genes, so any altering of genes is the same thing. I disagree.

I'll link you to another conversation which I think gives a good illustration of this. To use your example, many anthropologists would say that for the adherent, Ganesha is real. Furthermore, his experience with Ganesha is entirely and objectively real. And in order to truly do justice to the adherent's social world, it needs to be portrayed that way. I've read ethnographies where the researcher conducted interviews with spirits, via their medium, and in general were not too hung up at all on what sort of entity was actually speaking to them.  There's another level of engagement that anthropology has (or could have) with theology, and that's actually examining different theologies (of salvation or service or whatever), separate from - I don't know how to put it, but what you're talking about in your example. Not quite doctrine. Maybe I'll say separate from evaluating the objective truth or merit of a given religious practice. So for example, instead of studying, say, whether an ecological theology about trees (or whatever) is objectively and ecologically beneficial, we could look at how that theology is produced and reproduced and circulated and put into action.

Just a sense of being really irritated when I go to a conference that says it is aiming for a ""productive engagement"" or something between anthropologiests and theologians or religious studies types, but instead everybody ends up talking across each other.   Theologians or religious studies folk talk about anthropology all the time, they have courses in it at Christian colleges, how to use anthropology for Christian ministry, etc. See some of Amy Stambach's work on how this has been done (e.g. Faith in Schools or ""Education, Religion, and Anthropology in Africa"", Annual Review of Anthropology 39:1).   But the other way around (and by way of answering the first aspect), I haven't seen so much - although, if there's been more recent work that I haven't seen, I would really be happy to read it. I have read a couple articles (e.g. Robbins, Joel. 2006. ‘Anthropology and Theology: An Awkward Relationship?’. Anthropological Quarterly 79 (2): 285–94.) There's also a special issue of South Atlantic Quarterly (109:4) that addresses a lot of theological issues, although it's very theory-oriented and I don't think there is any ethnographic material."

The closest I can think of is the commentary-free work of Depardon on hospitals, tribunals and the Police.   Anthropology does center mostly around isolated,small groups : in our modern interconnected society, this kind of work would mostly be classified as sociology. There are small groups such as the one you suggest, but they will answer to wider western socialisation."

AskAnthropology,36h7q2,JurijFedorov,8,Tue May 19 11:03:52 2015 UTC,"Here is the statement you wish to discuss:  That capitalism hasn't existed since forever, and ancestral civilizations didn't practiced capitalism, thus it is nowhere near being ""human nature"".  Here is the definition of Capitalism you wish to use: Capitalism is an economic system and a mode of production in which trade, industries, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned.  Honestly, I don't know what ""ancestral civilizations"" means.  I would guess that it was being used in a broad sense.  The word itself hints at its own bias.  Civis were basically city folk. So, the narrowest definition would just include people who live in cities and their ways of life.  I would guess that the ancestral part of ""ancestral civilizations"" was meant to include more than just the time from the Neolithic Revolution onwards and stretch back to the earliest behaviorally modern homo sapiens.  Still, let us focus on the narrower definition.  If Rome pays its legionnaires a set amount of denarii a year and grants the praemia (money and/or land) upon completion of service, is this capitalism?  You have division of labor and labor is paid for by money.  However, you have the state fully regulating the exchange.  In a Capitalist system, the state does not organize the market through positive acts but through selective omission.  It structures the economy as much by what it choses to regulate (e.g. contracts, defining property, etc.) as what it does not.  In the legionnaire example, Rome has largely occupied the economic field.  It may adjust the number of denarii paid out a year but it still defines the wage.  Whereas, the state is a silent third party in a capitalist system.  Take the United States.  It is not that you privately own property any more than you did under feudalism.  The government can take your property.  It just can not take the property without just compensation.  So, you do not own the property; you own the value of the property.  It is the government first defining the property system in a certain way and then abstaining from taking action which creates private ownership of property.  The state rests in the background when exchanges occur having defined the playing field and not stepping into the fray."
AskAnthropology,36h7q2,gnothi_seauton,1 point,Tue May 19 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"Okay... best answer so far. Great point.  What I meant with capitalism was a capitalistic trade system. An economic system. I didn't differentiate between individuals and countries. If countries trade at all it is not communism and is the same as capitalism just on a bigger scale. I get the confusion if you only use it to describe a state system then. That's just fine. I guess I defined it to widely and didn't follow my own guidance. I also said that people owned capital but do agree that they didn't own the greatest means of production which is necessary for capitalism. So I guess it is not capitalism then.  My actual question was about the words the user used and the lack of sources. Like ""nowhere near being"". What does that imply? Then the users ends the sentence with ""  ""human nature"" "". What can be nowhere near human nature? Is it or is it not? Can a thing be not human nature and another thing be nowhere near human nature?  As we both implied. Ancestral civilizations means societies from 2000 to about 8000 years ago as they had to have cities. And another user here mentioned the Feudal system that was not capitalism. I agree. But capitalism has existed since millions of years ago. And our definition of capitalism, true capitalism, has existed for a few hundred years. But there is no arbitrary creation of it. It didn't just start one year. It was created by small trades I called capitalism, which it was not. Then men started paying for sex and partnerships. And leaders or lead members of the group like shamans demanded some tax. This is not capitalism. But the basis existed and is not ""nowhere near being ""human nature"" "". Do you agree?"
AskAnthropology,36h7q2,gnothi_seauton,9,Tue May 19 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"""Nowhere near being human nature"" is just hyperbole.  Exaggeration is a normal rhetorical technique to emphasize a point.  The statement has the exact same meaning as ""It is not human nature"".  It is not to say Capitalism is unnatural.  It just means that it is no more natural than any other system.    Compare capitalism to the missionary position.  The missionary position is no more ""natural"" than a position where the partner who is entered is sitting on top or is resting on hands and knees.  The claim that it is more natural is often used to give authority to particular cultural preferences.  So, saying it is not natural addresses claims of special, preferred status for a practice.    Saying ""Capitalism is not natural"" does not mean it violates the laws of physics.  It just means there are other ways human beings can and have organized economic activity.     But capitalism has existed since millions of years ago.   I would guess you might be referring to Chimpanzees trading meat for sex.  I suppose if you want to define capitalism as a bargained for exchange then sure.  But trade is not an economic system, a system of private property ownership, or a mode of production as your definition originally specified.  A fight is not a war anymore than a trade is an economic system.  A system is an organized whole.  One way to look at capitalism is that the lack of action plays a role in organizing the system as much as positive action does."

So you agree with her(his?) statement?   I honestly don't know.  On its face, the statement seems fairly straight forward.  I might translate it as ""This particular economic system which has emerged in recent centuries does not have enough similarities to economic systems in play thousands of years ago to be called the same.""  Saying things are different doesn't say much unless you know which criteria define the difference.  That's where there could be room for opinions to differ.  The statement itself should be read as part of an ongoing dialogue.  It is a response to the view that ""Capitalism is natural and has been practiced since the dawn of time.""  If you read it simply as a contradiction of this, then it is not controversial.    There is a tendency to imagine that people in the past were noble savages who lived in an ideal pre-scarcity, self-less gift economy and all was happy, all was good.  This golden age descended over many millennia into the dark oppressive system we have today.  That is an equally false 'history'."
AskAnthropology,36h7q2,MortRouge,10,Tue May 19 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"Capitalism ... a word that confuses everyone. It means different things for different people, because of the history of the word. There's a lot of propaganda and misunderstandings surrounding it. That Wikipedia actually lists ""crony capitalism"" among other real words makes me cringe a bit, but there are some good points in the article as well.   Let's go to the beginnings of the word.  Capitalism was a word constructed by the systems critics. While not the creators of the word, Marx and Engels are without a doubt the biggest influences and sources for how we popularly use the words outside of an everyday context (for example, in an academic setting ...).  For Marx, our contemporary economic setting (Capitalism!) was a marvelous thing. He saw what it produced, as did others: large scale cities, enormous industries and national wealth. His question was thus: What made this societal change possible? Marx did not think that all this was because of one single great man or anything like that, he linked the progression of society into modernity with the systematic changes that had occurred, both political and economic.  The term free market has nothing inherently to do with capitalism, nor is capitalism a consumer situation that you describe (markets, shops and so on). Capitalism is about who has the power and control; it is correct that it refers to the private ownership/control of the means of production (a very Marxist thing to say, I should add), in a sense.  Marx contrasted his contemporary society with his (somewhat historically imprecise) view of the former social relationships before the advent of Capitalism. He latched on to the term Feudalism (a word that is incredibly contested in today's academic world), and differentiated it with Capitalism in this way: In Feudalism, you work your own land for your local lord, and he lets you keep a share of your physical products (grain, vegetables, pigs and so on). This is law, you can't go and say that you will work for some other lord (because then you would hang). Capitalism does it another way, because there is no aristocracy or enforcement from the state that you work. You write a contract and get money (capital!) for your work, what we call a wage. Now, wages did exist in many fields of labour (construction for example), but during Feudalism, the norm was that you were a farmer, not a factory worker. In Capitalism, you don't usually get your share of the work you do in the form of physical goods (what would you use that many paper towels for?), but you get it int the form of money, credits. This constructs a very different way of economical relations that hasn't so much to do with trade (even though you can use your money to ""trade"" it for other goods, so to speak) and direct physical control of the products, but a system where the industrial product you create in the factories is distributed in another way and means something different than what a farm grown beet root would have meant in the 1300's. Marx talked about the product being fetishized, gaining an alienated meaning above it's physicality, since its production is distanced from the buyer (but this is another long story, even though it is what the first chapter of Capital deals with). But in any case, let me put it shortly: You wouldn't have been able to create something like Coca Cola without Capitalism.  There has always been different kind of enterprises and trade relations, free and less free markets during history. But there hasn't been an industrialized Capitalism like we have now."

Not how it was seen by communists. I understand that Feudalism is not capitalism. But you still had some trade as I say. Some people, countries and kings did trade. And they did pay labor. If they went to war they often hired labor.  Did the Roman Empire have capitalism? I'd say most certainly. Just not free trade. It was controlled from the top."
AskAnthropology,36h7q2,MortRouge,8,Wed May 20 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think the point you're missing is that capitalism is not a system of trade, but a system of production.

Just because /u/MortRouge used Marx as their example, doesn't mean their response was biased towards communism. It's hard to find a more comprehensive study of capitalism than Marx's Das Kapital. /u/MortRouge also never opined on whether this social arrangement is good or bad."

AskAnthropology,36h7q2,MortRouge,17,Tue May 19 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"You are missing the point that it is a lexical question. Capitalism is as much a historical term as a political one. The Roman Empire did not have Capitalism; it was not industrialized.   And for that matter, it wasn't always controlled from the top I think (if the top is the state), much of Rome consisted of large artisan cartels if my memory serves me correctly (some more knowledgeable than me can fill in on this)."
AskAnthropology,36h7q2,diporasidi,10,Tue May 19 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"Not quite. What you are thinking of are the collegia, which were professional associations that have some resemblance to Medieval guilds (which fit your phrase of ""artisan cartels"" much better) but were very much not guilds. In particular, the political structure of Roman cities was very different from medieval ones and collegia were not political institutions in the same way guilds were. In particular, they were not legal monopolies--if you wanted to make shoes there was no legal obligation to join a shoe seller collegium (which doesn't mean you won't get run out of town, of course).  It actually gets a lot more complicated, of course.  But there is a broader problem with your statement here and it gets to the reason why ancient economic studies has really moved away from the four fold marxian historical progression. Capitalism (and industrialization, but that is a different issue) isn't a switch that you flip on or off, people didn't wake up in Manchester one day and think ""by George, we're capitalists today!"" capitalism is a form of economic activity, and one that was, in fact, quite highly present in the Roman world. You have, for example, fractional reserve banking, land speculation, technological enhancement of labor and wage earning, even in the countryside: account books from Egypt show that rural laborers were paid monetary wages. And this wasn't just marginal activity, and while we shouldn't see the Roman Empire as being some sort of proto-Victorian England but its complexity isn't really captured by the idea of a ""slave economy"".  So does this mean that I am saying Rome was capitalist? Well, no, although capitalism was a form of activity that was present, albeit not dominate in the Roman world. But more importantly, a sort of strictMarxist historiography is something that is really only a (largely Italian, oddly enough) minority in the field. The concept that has gotten quite popular recently is Rome as an imperial economy, as that stresses that the economic system was fundamentally structured by the political and social one rather than the other way around.  But again, it gets more complicated."

The best thing you are going to get will be comparing different historical definitions, and therefore I suggest that you start with the most influential source of the word (to the degree that it is almost THE original definition), namely Marx. This will also help you understand why people around here contest that Capitalism existed in older times, since Marx is one of the founding fathers of social sciences, and they will generally roll with an sociological/anthropological/historical definition of the word because of obvious reasons.

AskAnthropology,36h7q2,THHUXLEY,7,Tue May 19 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"Capitalism is not originally defined by Marx. It was defined several hundred years before he was born.    ""Piety"" was defined back in Roman times with the name pietas. To us today, piety means a spiritual devotion--a passion, reverence to some kind of spiritual being embraced through our faith. What is in our heart.  But the Romans understand ""piety"" differently. They don't actually care what is in your heart. To them, ""piety"" means a strict observance in sacrificial ritual. You can believe in Jupiter or in Jesus or even in Elagabal, as long as you keep attending temples. Christians in Roman times were persecuted because they refused to attend temples.  This analogy is meant to illustrate that pre-Marx conception of capitalism is not that fruitful if you want to understand what we mean as ""capitalism"" in modern sense. I recall this term existed in medieval Frankish Kingdom (CMIIW), but it doesn't mean anything today. If you want to actually understand what capitalism means today (instead of proving a point), /u/MortRouge has explained it very nicely."

AskAnthropology,368xf5,doos,0,Sun May 17 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yes it is often the case where labor does not need more than 3-4 hours a day. Hunter gatherers often have more free time than someone working eight-hour shifts. In one scenario your tribe may kill a herd of mammoths. For at least a month you have to do nothing but process those kills. But hunter gatherer life was not always full of abundance, as we well know there are hard times too.  On average, is probably very misleading. It is more important to consider the lifestyles of the tribes as they are full of unique characteristics that are white-washed when you generalize.  In tropical rainforests where it is hot and humid, and where food can be grown quickly, the work-load is greatly reduced and males especially find much more leisure time.  In Chinese the character for mother is a combination of woman and horse. Probably because she had to work really hard like a beast of burden. So there is also the division of labor between genders which should be taken into account. Generally woman with children do not really ever stop working.  You may also consider people in modern society who have infinite free time.  Some people buy an RV and live off their pension, others start businesses, and so forth.  So it really is difficult to answer your question with accuracy you see. There are too many things to consider, and a generalization like you want is not really useful at all without a specific context."

Ethnology is generally considered a subfield of anthropology, which (by the American four field system) also includes biological anthropology, linguistics, and archaeology. Ethnology, or cultural anthropology, focuses on the study of extant cultures."

AskAnthropology,367ay5,anossXVIII,26,Sat May 16 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"There are some issues with this premise. Some of the issues are linguistic, some are a matter of perspective. The first two are more scientific based in linguistics.  1 - ""…the number of languages one speaks…""  This is harder to quantify than you may think. How do you classify someone who speaks two varieties of Mandarin that are not mutually intelligible? Is that one language or two? Or someone who speaks AAVE as well as ""Standard"" American English (hereafter GenAm), both natively? Two dialects of English but with distinctly different grammar systems, so having that is clearly not on par with just being able to speak GenAm.  2 - ""…those who are completely illiterate…""  This is also a big problem. You're suggesting an inherent link between speaking languages and literacy, but that's not really a good connection to be assuming. To start, of the worlds 7000 or so languages, a very large number simply have no writing system. I work with communities where members speak 3 or 4 languages by default, but only have a writing system for one or two of those. In some cases, communities have actively chosen to not have any writing system for their language. I believe there are Native American groups who've made this decision but someone else will have to give more detail on that.  3 - other factors  Additionally, how much of a factor is your Mandarin and German in your being able to graduate now? I'd imagine not much. Generally speaking the amount of proficiency the average uni student has in a language they've been required to study for gen-ed credits isn't that high.  Additionally, very highly educated people in America and Australia are often monolingual. And nearly-completely uneducated people in many places around the globe are regularly fluent in many languages, simply as a result of the environment in which they were brought up.  So if there is any actual correlation between education level and language ability, I'd guess it might actually be negative, but whether it is or not I'd also guess that it's not statistically significant unless you're looking at only a place like the US which is famously monolingual but also developed and values education fairly highly (mostly)."
AskAnthropology,367ay5,keyilan,8,Sun May 17 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"To add to this, you'll find lots of uneducated people working as traders in some parts of the world who speak lots of languages.   I'm from Dubai, and you'll find people working in some markets here who come from Afghanistan or Northern Pakistan, meaning they already speak at least two languages, learning English because that's what everyone speaks; Russian, because of all the Russian tourists; and possibly Arabic, because it's the language of the government.   That's a person who might never have gone to school speaking five languages. This isn't uncommon in other parts of the world either."

On the other hand, there's me with my BA in anthro and I speak three in addition to English. In both cases it depends more on circumstances like immersion than strictly education."
AskAnthropology,367ay5,scatterstars,1 point,Sun May 17 09:36:25 2015 UTC,You raise an idea that is deeply fascinating. What are the motivations/benefits  to avoid having a written form of their native language?  Also I suppose equally important are there any cultures were the people on average were aware of what writing was and had no other language with a writing system but made the choice anyway?  I only bring up this second point as Native Americans generally speak English so it seems like they would not be missing out on all the benefits of writing by making that call.
AskAnthropology,367ay5,Derpese_Simplex,1 point,Sun May 17 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"What are the motivations/benefits to avoid having a written form of their native language?   In some cases the concept of writing is seen as a thing of the occupier/oppressor. Maybe a group wants an orthography but they don't want to use the same alphabet that the national language uses because it's symbolic of the people in power who aren't great towards this group. Maybe they don't want to use English letters because that's the orthography used by the missionaries and they don't like the missionaries.  In other cases the group sees their oral tradition as significant and, since the language has always been unwritten and the importance is on story telling not story reading, a writing system just isn't something they want.   are there any cultures were the people on average were aware of what writing was and had no other language with a writing system but made the choice anyway?   Yes absolutely. Again see the example of Native American groups making this decision. Also keep in mind that in many cases the group may be 100% literate in the national language but still not want a writing system for their own language. It's not too uncommon.   Native Americans generally speak English so it seems like they would not be missing out on all the benefits of writing by making that call.   You say benefits but that may be a matter of perspective. For some the greater benefit may be in not having a writing system.   Another point that's only tangentially related but may be significant: The number of languages which use a native writing system is even less. Only about half the world's languages have developed writing systems, though not always are those still in use. There are probably around a thousand languages, so 1/7 of the total number, which are simply not written at all. There are some holes in the data so we don't really have exact numbers. That 'thousand' estimate could be more."

I'd adjust the focus a bit. Make it so you're only looking at people in your own country.   I don't know where you're from but you seem like a native English speaker and you're awake right now so I'm gonna go with Australia. If that's the case, you could look at the same topic you've suggested, but limit it to citizens (therefore eliminating foreign students who may by necessity be bilingual as well as not yet educated, etc). I'm sure if you did this in America you'd find a slightly higher instance of being multilingual among the highly educated who are now working.  I would also include data for what kind of education they have. I don't mean level, but rather field. Medical doctors might be more likely to be monolingual than people working in academia, for example.  tl;dr: You can still do this topic but if you want to see anything meaningful in the data (which your teacher will probably hope for) then you need to limit you sample somewhat."

Some places in Europe, Africa, India, etc. it is common for everyone to speak at least three languages.   In Europe is is far more common and carries much more utility to speak more than one language than in the US for example. If you are in certain places in Canada, you are forced to learn two languages.  You would have to study by slicing the world up, rather than doing it broadly.  And then, what are you actually measuring? Just propensity for language perhaps, and how does this correlate to intelligence?  Likely you'll use an IQ score as your measure, but how accurate is that? And will this definition sufficiently answer your question?  There are so many problems with the metric you are proposing, and the introduction for error is great, and even the definitions you choose will not be suited for a broad range of applications.  So you can do a study, you can define the parameters, and reduce your error.

A ""borrowed"" item never goes too far away, and is easy to keep track of even if you are not in direct possession of it.  I've heard someone make the case that locks were a necessary invention for more dense communities to exist. When a population gets to the point where items can just disappear into the faceless masses, ownership becomes much more important.  Did they interact with other communities? Could you see any difference in what liberties they extended to members of their community, regular visitors and unknown visitors?"

AskAnthropology,35xjzr,morecabernet,59,Thu May 14 10:24:29 2015 UTC,"According to Nigel Barley's Adventures in a Mud Hut (about his fieldwork among the Dowayo people in Africa), the Dowayo language had a quirk where, for instance, a civet cat was an ""old female leopard,"" but that could also refer to an old female leopard.   On one of his trips to town he bought postcards with photos of the different local cats so that he could have them point to the one they were talking about.   But when he tried showing, say, a picture of a leopard, the Dowayo would examine it intently for a while and hand it back, saying things like ""I do not know this man.""   I think Barley then said that this was a known thing in anthropology--that processing photos and paintings (as ""realistic"" as they appear to us) is a skill we have to practice, and people who have had no practice don't know what they're supposed to be looking at. But in any case, the Dowayo show that it's possible.  (He eventually got bits of each cat's fur and had them point to those instead, and then he knew what they were talking about.)"

AskAnthropology,35xjzr,Thecna2,7,Fri May 15 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"Because if you were raised in this society which allegedly has no representational art then when showing a photo you would struggle to understand what you see. I can hold a photo of an elephant and see thats it meant to be a huge 12foot tall grey animal, but if had no concept of art at all then you may be unable to see the elephant in the picture as you have never conceived before the ability to represent an animal in an abstract way."
AskAnthropology,35xjzr,Manfromporlock,4,Fri May 15 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"Well, in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, which is an unjustly forgotten classic (Mayhew was like the Studs Terkel of 1840s London), an early photographer is talking about the tricks of the trade. One of his tricks was, if a shot didn't come out, he'd just give the customer a photo of someone else:   The fact is, people don’t know their own faces. Half of ‘em have never looked in a glass half a dozen times in their life, and directly they see a pair of eyes and a nose, they fancy they are their own.    If in fact he was telling the truth and he could get away with the trick, the explanation he gives seems impossible--the customer should have been able to tell that the person in the photograph was wearing different clothes, or at least he should have come running back as soon as he showed the photo to anyone else. But it sort of makes sense if neither the subject or anyone else could visually process photos.  BUT, the idea that people would have a problem specifically with photographs seems odd to me--I think it's more 2D images of anything. And in the early days of photography people in the West were used to processing images, from realistic paintings to cheap prints. So the photographer was probably just bragging about how much smarter he was than his customers."

The general gist of the story was about an experiment with photographs and a group of Pigmy's that lived deep in the jungle (sorry, don't remember a specific tribe). A member of the tribe was shown a photograph of an elephant in the distance, and asked if they knew what it was. The subject responded ""what type of insect is that?"" as they had no linguistic concept to cover ""large animal far away"" because the jungle prevents seeing at great distance. Thus the only way they could mentally conceive it was as an insect. Sorry, I have no reference for this, like I said, it was told during a (500 level) class a long time ago."

A much simpler explanation is that the photo/picture took away the sense of scale, and that they were not familiar with that sort of thing, rather than not having the concept of large-animal-far-away, since surely they would be aware of something like an elephant stampede coming in their direction and know to seek cover.

If we take the other commenters statement that recognising photographs and so on is a practice (which I think there is a good argument to be made for), then it would honestly vary greatly between tribes by virtue of their differing levels of exposure to photography. If on the other hand you believe that humans have an innate ability to recognise each other, then the question becomes why wouldn't X group be able to? Also, although this might seem needlessly picky, there is an assumption that the rest of the ""non-tribal"" world reads photographs and realist paintings in the same way, the Japanese way of reading a photograph may will be every different to an American way, for example.  Just as an example, A. C. Haddon used to discuss how he would give the people of the Torres strait photographs of family members who had died between his visits and they seemed to recognise them and formed a bond with Haddon for providing them. I say seemed simply because I've never read anything that indicates what the people he worked with actually said about the photographs.  To add to that, one of the lecturers in my university works with ""pygmies"" (although he hates that term and is yet to come up with an alternative that people will accept) and they have been commenting on photographs produced about them, and recognise the subjects, for many years.  None of this is to say that some ""tribal peoples"" do not have trouble with recognising photographs and realist art, but rather that grand generalisations are very difficult to make and often have shakey foundations. I would say that if you wish to know about a particular peoples understanding of photographs etc. then it would be best to read about each group. It would be interesting to see a paper that drew all those different groups conceptions and readings of photographs and realist arts together and drew out commonalities and differences, but I think there would be too many differences.   The too long didn't read of this would be it's very difficult in Anthropology to make grand generalisations, but some ""tribal groups"" do read photos as we would (i.e. photograph of John does contain John) while others don't (It is a person, but I do not know who).  If you're interested in Anthropology and Photography more generally Christopher Pinney has a great book called Anthropology and Photography (creatively named) the goes through the use of photography in anthropology and has some examples of photographs being shown to those who were in the photos."

Not all traits are adaptive, so different human populations would not look identical to those today. Skin color is a great example of a trait that we would probably expect to see again. In fact, lighter skin color is an example of convergent evolution, as lighter skin probably occurred independently in the ancestors of European and Asian populations (this isn't my research area, so I'm not 100% sure of this, but I have read that this is the case). I'm not sure about the other traits that you mentioned, but one way to estimate how likely it is that a trait would recur would be to look for signatures of positive selection. One thing to keep in mind is that not all beneficial mutations become fixed in a population, so it's possible that certain beneficial would not happen again.  http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/misconcep_07 https://anthrogenetics.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/four-methods-to-detect-positive-selection-from-the-genetic-data-of-modern-human-populations/"
AskAnthropology,35wcc1,skeletor_999,2,Thu May 14 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, I would like to point out that modern humans are remarkably genetically similar to each other. There is less genetic variability in all of Homo sapiens than in Pan troglodytes (chimps).   The dispersal of humans out of Africa followed the dispersal of earlier hominins (eg. Homo erectus) out of Africa (Klein 2009). There is evidence of Homo heidelbergensis evolving into Homo neanderthalensis in Europe. Recently, there is Homo erectus ergaster georgicus from Georgia in Eastern Europe (Lordkipanidze et al. 2013) and the enigmatic Denisovans in Siberia (Reich et al. 2010). All this adds up to a lot of people wandering around outside of Africa prior to the arrival of anatomically modern humans.   Recent studies of ancient and modern DNA indicate that anatomically modern humans were interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans (Reich et al. 2010, Fu et al. 2014, Prufer et al. 2014). So, if you're only asking about the spread of anatomically modern humans out of Africa, they would probably have encountered these populations in any random scenario. Interbreeding with the Neanderthals and Denisovans likely did not have large impacts on modern human morphology, but it's hard to say. Some of the traits related to the modern diversity of humans may be related to this early interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans. African populations do not share any DNA with Neanderthals or Denisovans, while other modern populations do. Modern people from Australia and Papua New Guinea have more Denisovan DNA contributions than any other modern population (Prufer et al. 2014). If interbreeding with Denisovans had any impact on morphology, than it is possible that a different spread of humans after that event would have resulted in a different distribution of traits geographically.

AskAnthropology,35t90f,Lazar_Taxon,3,Wed May 13 09:07:44 2015 UTC,"""Buddist societies"" is a big term! Can you specify a few countries in particular that you're especially interested in?  ETA: Also, I think you're missing a crucial distinction Buddhism has historically made between laypersons and monks. Laypersons were never held to the same standards of behavior as monks. While monks in China, Korea and Japan will not eat meat (and come form a school/tradition commonly known as Mahayana), many of the monks in Southeast Asia (Theravada tradition) beg daily for their food and must eat whatever they are given. This may include meat. So one of the issues I see with your question is that you are starting from a false assumption: that Buddhism lacks a layperson/monk distinction, which is huge in terms of what is required and expected behaviorally.   Also, it would be very helpful if you would list what sources you're reading. Sutras/Suttas? Particular teachers or teachings? What schools of Buddhist thought?"
AskAnthropology,35t90f,BirdsMilkCake,2,Wed May 13 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm most interested in areas that seem more ""exclusively"" Buddhist, like Burma, Thailand or maybe Tibet.  I'm aware of the lay vs. monastic distinction, and of the fact that Theravada monks eat meat. But the five precepts are undertaken by lay followers, and the first precept is to abstain from killing living things. My interest is mostly in the people who actually kill animals, and how, if at all, people reconcile this with identifying as Buddhist."

Everyone interprets things slightly different. Over time you have a grand game of Chinese whispers, where surface level details see the most change and fundamental ideals hopefully do not change at all.  Buddha ate meat, says a monk that I asked. His school eats meat but only when it is given to them. Others only eat meat, if they did not kill the animal. Others only eat fish. Others do not eat any meat. And so on.  Depending on your sangha, teacher, and school of thought, you will treat the consumption of meat differently.  They also treat the notion of karma differently."
AskAnthropology,35mvgr,ProjectFrostbite,45,Mon May 11 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"I work in a lab with one of the world's most well-known Pacific archaeologists and he believes that it was a combination of a) Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans) destroying the trees' reproductive abilities by eating all of their seeds/seedlings,  and b) overuse by inhabitants.   BUT, in addition, the island environment itself is an unusual one that is not hospitable to plant growth. Geologically it is a very old volcanic island, and has very nutrient-depleted soils for this reason, contributing to the depauperate nature of the environment there. Due to its location, it also doesn't receive the nutrients carried in the Asian Dust that usually blows over onto many islands in the Pacific, including Hawai'i. This dust becomes the dominant source of soil nutrients (such as silicon and phosphorus) on islands that are weathered and whose nutrients have leached away. This dust therefore keeps old island soils fertile for plants.   In addition, once seabirds stopped using it as a rookery (after humans arrived), a link in the nutrient chain was cut out-- seabirds often make old nutrient-leached islands fertile by dropping the nutrients of the guano (phosphorus, nitrogen) into the land continuously. On Easter Island (Rapa Nui), given its geologic age and the disappearance of the birds, it was very difficult to get stuff to grow without the aid of boulder mulching (breaking up un-leached rocks for nutrients), sunken gardens, and other innovative techniques. The people did the best they could. But the main point is that this was a fragile ecosystem, and the accretional effects of birds leaving, the island being old, rats eating seeds and seedlings, and people cutting trees down too, were more than enough to cause a major ecological disaster."
AskAnthropology,35mvgr,kingofbeards,36,Tue May 12 04:17:06 2015 UTC,I think your disbelief stems from the fact that if they were intensively deforesting to the point that it was having detrimental social effects common sense dictates that they would have stopped behaving that way before all the trees were gone.  You're right. If they had realised what would happen they probably would've stopped.   The way I have seen it taught is that the inhabitants of the Island did not completely wipe out the trees on the Island but instead did enough damage to the ecosystem that it began to cave under the pressure of sustaining human life.  So instead of suddenly looking up and there being no more trees the inhabitants carried on doing what they were doing without seeing any appreciable difference in their way of life until they did just enough damage to a fragile self contained ecosystem that it imploded and soil erosion and normal human consumption of resources finished the job.

With a team of 25 and ropes they were able to walk the statue up into position by rhythmically rocking it forward. This correlates with wear patterns on the base of statues showing more wear on the bottom, the further they are from the quarry.

AskAnthropology,35mvgr,ptera_tinsel,3,Mon May 11 21:09:50 2015 UTC,I watched Easter Island: Mysteries of a Lost World on Netflix. It was a fascinating documentary in which Dr. Jago Cooper explains an alternate theory which posits that the deforestation was intentional and did not contribute to the collapse of their society.  He explains all of the rich agricultural techniques of the Rapa Nui prevented them from being dependent on their forest and shows there is little evidence of trauma or malnutrition on the skeletons that would follow dwindling resources.   He posits an alternate theory that it was actually disease brought by the first Dutch visitors that led to the Rapa Nui's demise. Which he suggests is backed up by accounts that they went from being perceived as thriving by the first visitors to only a handful of struggling people left within 50 years by the second. It's a really cool watch.
AskAnthropology,35mvgr,kingofbeards,2,Tue May 12 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"Though this is an interesting idea, there is in fact some evidence that people may have experienced undernourishment by later pre-contact phases. Government and ideology had a breakdown in later phases (which resulted in the rise of the Bird Man Cult) and people were struggling for power, which likely affected food supplies, which were already taxed by environmental difficulties. The possibility of undernutrition in particular is evidenced in peculiar artistic representations that crop up  and the late taking up of cannibalism (noted as extensive by avifaunal bone analyst/expert David Steadman, who analyzed countless bone assemblages but never published about the evidence of cannibalism in detail)."

In many of these cases, the Sentinelese being one of the more famous examples of this, we don't even know what their language is. We can guess based on proximity what it might be related to, but beyond that we know absolutely nothing about their language, which means we also know nothing about what they say or think about certain celestial bodies.  If there were such a group that had a written language (not likely in these cases based on the numbers of spoken languages vs written languages in the world), and some of those written records somehow made it out of the community without the community members otherwise being in touch with the outside world, then we'd potentially be able to know some things about those people while still having them classified as uncontacted.

That being said, it is worth keeping in mind that our relation to material today is radically different than what it was even two hundred years ago, let alone 40,000. Our modern economic system produces an incredible material abundance, which in turn effects how we value material goods. Assuming you in the world of 2015 approach a bracelet in the same way as a hunter gatherer 40,000 years ago is unwarranted. Their only material possessions were, in effect, what they could carry, which makes carrying something that serves no practical purpose (a bracelet) has a very deep significance."
AskAnthropology,35ib43,Tiako,1 point,Sun May 10 22:32:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, but want to add that maybe your (the OP) interpretation of jewelry in the present is a bit lacking in reflection about the social significance of that jewelry. Certainly, the surficial reason for wearing jewelry in modern Western cultures is based on aesthetics, but almost nothing humans do isn't governed by some sort of cultural and social factors. There is a reason a man wearing huge hoop earrings or a woman wearing a heavy, gold watch would be looked at oddly in many places. Wearing certain jewelry marks you as male or female gendered in the ways that society constructs those genders. Certainly, this isn't religious significance, and as you and /u/Tiako rightly note, we can't really know what that significance of these objects were to people so distant from us in time and culture. That said, we also shouldn't assume they weren't socially significant in SOME way, whether or not they relate to religion.   Bottom line, yes it is unwarranted to make such a sweeping statement about all jewelry in the past, but it problematic in its own way to assume it didn't have some social significance of some sort more than just ""it is pretty""."
AskAnthropology,35ib43,RioAbajo,32,Tue May 12 04:27:06 2015 UTC,"It's an assumption via ethnographic analogy assuming the earliest religions were animistic. In this form of religion everything is religious. In the western sense of religion the spiritual and secular are walled off from each other. In most non-western religions and especially in animism there is literally no difference between secular and religious because there is no secular.   The archaeologist is assuming that the bracelet would have served some type of religious role as nearly everything would have.   It's not direct evidence.   I will say there is often a default explanation in archaeology which assumes everything not yet understood is religious. It's an easy cop out from having to admit there are some things we don't, and can't, know about the past."

AskAnthropology,35ib43,MrKitteh,13,Sun May 10 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"This might be a case of bad journalism. Some dubious remarks:   In what is quite an amazing discovery, scientists have confirmed that a bracelet found in Siberia is 40,000 years old. This makes it the oldest piece of jewelry ever discovered...   Personal adornment made out of shell beads has been dated to 70+ kya at Blombos Cave, South Africa (d'Errico et al 2005. Perhaps there are even earlier cases. I have no idea why this find is claimed to be the oldest.   Indeed, the recent discovery of a female Denisovan finger bone and various teeth shows that they had no morphological similarities to either Neanderthals or modern humans.  ...  Skeletal remains show that the Denisovans were probably far more robust and powerful than modern humans, and were, until now, assumed to be a more primitive, archaic type of humans than us.   I don't see how these claims can be made on the paucity of skeletal remains, which amount to the aforementioned teeth and finger bones.   However, experiments have now definitely ruled that out, and they confirm that it could not have been made by homo sapiens or Neanderthals.   What, exactly, were these experiments?   The bracelet was very delicate and was probably worn at special occasions by some important person, such as a Denisovan princess.   Again, with the extreme paucity of remains or material culture from Denisovans, there is no way to make this claim.   All jewellery had a magical meaning for ancient people. Bracelets and neck adornments were to protect people from evil spirits, for instance.   Again, a bald and sweeping assertion. All jewelry had a ""magical meaning""? How do you prove that?"

AskAnthropology,35ib43,MrKitteh,9,Sun May 10 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way tho. The part of the article regarding religious causation is talking about how the bracelet is most likely could have been worn by some type of ""elite"" or princess of that Denisovan society.  Let's think about circumstances today. You can most definitely buy and wear things because they are pretty and shiny. Most shiny and pretty things are also cheap to manufacture, acquire, and relatively easy to mass produce with barely any human skill involved.   Consider the bracelet in question. The material is stated as having been imported. Meaning some form of travel or trade had to be performed. Also consider the type of technology and learned skill that would have been necessary to produce such an item. With all these things in mind, it would be very unlikely for a craftsman in that society to deem the time, cost, and labor as worthwhile in manufacturing a bracelet like that just for regular folk to wear just because they feel like it.   Instead, consider that because of it's relatively high cost (in time, labor, etc etc), it would've only be used by somebody important from that society, akin to the British Monarchy's Crown Jewels in importance and how it denotes it's wearer's elite status. Consider also how the current thought on prehistoric society's are that the one's who are considered to be spiritually significant (think Kings, Priestesses, Chiefs) are most often leading the group.   From there it's not really far fetched to assume that the Denisovans attach spiritual significance to the bracelet because it most probably would have been used only by their elite. Does all that kinda give you a better picture? The religious causation you pointed out is a product of forming together all of the information and circumstances, and context that we DO know of those societies at that time and trying our best to form a coherent picture of them.   Edit: If it helps, think about how pre-contact Native American tribes think highly of their war bonnets, and the spiritual and political importance it has for the person wearing them. Coincidentally, consider how your views on the bracelet could have similarities with how Native American headdresses are viewed today."

AskAnthropology,35jwbv,tequilajinx,3,Mon May 11 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"I've clarified a couple times I'm not religious. But up until a few months ago he was deeply fundamental Christian. My religious responses to him were to sort of gauge where he was still at in that regard. Tribulation period and rapture are cornerstones of fundamentalist Christian teaching. I was wondering if he had joined a few fringe groups.   I don't care if he just had a change of philosophy, I just find some of his choice or verbiage to be troubling. 'I'm not meant for this world'.. I'm just slightly worried is all."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,windwolfone,1 point,Mon May 11 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"Got it,  thanks.    I think his word choice (""I am not meant for this world"")  is no different than very devout Christians who decide to become priests or monks.   I have met many people who speak like your brother.  They may be overzealous to the point of being mildly deluded,  but they weren't dangerous to themselves or others."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,tequilajinx,-4,Tue May 12 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"Sadly,don't know.  On your brother though,  I think he has gone insane and while probalby has not join a cult has embraced incriedbly stupid/dangerous ideas but I don't know how to help."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,windwolfone,14,Mon May 11 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"To echo others, please get your brother to a psychologist now! This very much sounds like Schizophrenia.  I'm from the Tampa/St. Pete area. The Church of Scientology operates very heavily in this region (Clearwater, the home of the CoS is right next to St. Pete). It's very possible that he was approached by them (they recruit constantly by offering free ""personality tests"" which a lot of tourists wind up taking without realizing it's being done by CoS) and fed some of their gibberish which could explain some of the new-agey speech."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,rbaltimore,2,Mon May 11 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely not Scientology, which is really little more than a glorified life coach.  There are no prophecies or end time revelations in it, just motivational ideas wrapped up in gobbly gook that works for some people."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,Alienqueen,2,Mon May 11 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"True, but many of the Scientologists I've run into are pretty new-agey (certainly not all).   I've gone into a recruitment center before (for shits and grins) and have seen how their sales pitch works. I can see how a delusional person could extrapolate a lot from that experience without even joining the CoS. And being from the area, if the guy believes he had some sort of spiritual journey or awakening down here, they're the most likely candidate.  Alternatively, he could have seen the light at one of our world famous strip joints... they've been known to do that."

AskAnthropology,35jwbv,rbaltimore,2,Tue May 12 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"Please be aware of how people with no training whatsoever will blithely diagnose someone from afar after a few paragraphs. I saw so many people say he is schizophrenic, which he could very well be but how the hell could anyone diagnose that on reddit is simply absurd. So maybe you should get your brother professional help before these people convince you that it is or isn't one thing or another.   This is a very good point. While I suggested that he might be suffering from an acute psychotic episode and his statements did sound like they could be ideas of/delusions of reference, I probably did not make it clear enough that this is just a guess and that my experience as a social worker doesn't allow me to make diagnoses over the internet (although it does qualify me to point out that not all psychotic activity is caused by schizophrenia, there are many, many other causes for psychotic symptoms. Moreover, having studied 'cults' (New Religious Movements, or NRMs) quite extensively in undergrad (my advisor is an NRM expert), I also know that NRMs, which are generally harmless, can temporarily have a strong effect on people.

AskAnthropology,35jwbv,autopornbot,1 point,Tue May 12 11:14:42 2015 UTC,No. He does do drugs however. He said that this started after he had a 'spiritual awakening' from taking drugs. I can only assume he took one helluva trip.
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,autopornbot,0,Mon May 11 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"Oh man... recognize this. My dearest childhood friend had the same experience, since taking LSD (he smokes weed regularly, too, and tried pretty many herbs that can give a trip). Taking LSD once can change your brain chemistry permanently (or as he said: ""something broke in me and i'm not the same person anymore"" and ""i know things i never knew existed"" ""universe makes sense now, i see everything much better"" you figure). Probably other drugs can do the same. This is a tough situation -  you don't know how much of this is trip and how much is permanent damage or schizophrenia. Probably, his friends do drugs, too. IMO, your brother has... already enough symptoms to be admitted to closed psych ward. But anyway, he needs  psych help (even if it's not the closed ward).  Edit: If he has schizophrenia, he needs to be treated, because this is not going to get better, just worse."
AskAnthropology,35jwbv,rbaltimore,2,Mon May 11 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was a social worker after I got my anth degree, and these may be ideas of/delusions of reference, a symptom of psychotic disorders or psychotic breaks in which an individual experiences innocuous events or sometimes coincidences and then interprets them to have strong personal significance or relevance, sometimes to the point of including them in elaborate delusions.  The good news is that the risk of suicide and self-harm is lower in psychotic disorders than in mood disorders, and the fact that he does not have a clearly defined date for when this is all going down is also good, but psychotic episodes need to be taken seriously, and he absolutely needs psychological intervention. If it gets really bad, you can take him to the ER and they will hold him for 72 hours and try to get to the bottom of this."

The age of Aquarius (which we're now in) is an astrological alignment of sorts, it follows in the same path as the ""Mayan 2012"" end of the world thing. It's not a literal end of the world like explosions and destruction, but moreso end of current society, a new age beginning, like the jump from medieval age to industrial/colonial age to scientific age to our now current technological advanced-ness. The belief is that we have reached the peak of this""age"", though our path has been full of self destruction and picking sides and killing each other for money/profit, and this coming new age will be one not of intellectual advances in technology and money making, but in embracing the love and humanity of people, that we are all one and should love each other as we would like unto ourselves.     Your brother isn't going to stab anyone, or start a suicide squad, i don't think. Sounds to me like he sees a lot of our current reality as it is, a big fake facade where we glorify money and possessions and use people like objects, where aquiring things is ""how it is"", how people in power are there for the power not for the people. That's the awakening. It's a realisation people must experience, rather than an intellectual understanding which will be swiftly brushed off to carry on going with this fake reality.     PM me, your brother isn't crazy, he's just realised how absurd and stupid the whole system is and that most people (like your parents from what he says) are set in their ways, he can't make them realise. He's going to go live true to the awakened reality, away from the rat race of modern life. Just my opinion anyway"

First of all, check out Marc Auge for sure, if you've not looked into his work yet.   Another good place to start is a paper by Thomas Hylland Eriksen called In Limbo: Notes on the Culture of Airports + his references (I think there's a full text on his website actually). It's old (1992) but is a nice and comprehensive review of potential approaches and problems with studying airports as 'non-places'.   I also highly recommend looking at Brenda Chalfin's ethnography Neoliberal Frontiers and her articles about airport anthropology in Ghana. She really gets in on the airport as an important, separate, cultural space, although she kind of deconstructs the idea that airports are non-places... Marie Claude-Haince has also done some ethnographic work in a Canadian airport though I'm not sure she has any publications out yet.   If you get stumped with the airport articles, remember there is a ton of literature on identity in border areas, a lot of which is applicable to airports and touches more generally upon navigating ports of entry as non-places or transitory spaces. Look at the work of Aihwa Ong and Alan and Josephine Smart re: identity and ports of entry.  You're right that there is very little work being done in Anthropology on this topic right now, but there is substantial work in other disciplines (sociology, political geography, political science) so you might want to search for articles in those journals-- Environment and Planning D: Society and Space and Geopolitics are good places to look.   Anyway, hope this helps. I'd be very interested to hear what the people you interview have to say!"

So I'm going to take the JD route because it's shorter. I started by taking the LSAT, which  you take take for free if you are poor enough, and I was. I tested well enough to get a full ride at a state school in the southwest, which was amazing because I am a 30 minute drive from 5 or 6 federally recognized major tribes and I will be interning with a tribe this summer. So that will give me a taste of tribal legal culture early on.   Law and anthropology are intimately connected, if you think about it. Law is the rules we make up for ourselves about what is right and what is wrong. There's no universal law of inheritance out there in the sky, no universal law of property, no universal law of property or divorce. It's all cultural, and the longer I'm in law school the more I see it as an Anglo cultural imposition. Actually, there are scholars out there who just study law and culture, but I haven't had any time to read them, but once my finals are over (2 left!) I may pick up some of their work because it's a big topic. Tribes often have their own systems of common law.

After graduating I managed cultural programs for an Indian Education grant for three years before accepting my current position managing electronic communications (web design, social media) for an educational organization. Getting multiple degrees in anthropology and then immediately entering the workforce in a cultural field caused something of a career crisis for me. I was highly uncomfortable in my position because I wasn't a part of the ethnic group for which I was working, and people constantly questioned my right to educate their children about their own culture (which they totally should have). After thinking back to my classes, which were 90% white both at the undergraduate and graduate level, taught by professors who were also mostly white, and the fact that the anthropologists evaluating our programs were entirely white, I decided that the whole thing was kind of a sham. How much can you say about the lives of other people."

Had CPA's, MBA's, even a doctor in my law school class and it was just terrible for everyone lol.

At this point I'm considering a double major in Anthro and Classics, and I'm guessing that Latin will help for law school (as well as the convoluted translating that must be done). I'm leaning towards Anthro more though because I feel like it gives me a few more options than Classics if law school doesn't work out (for whatever reason ... I plan for the worst).   That said, it's also something I'm genuinely interested in studying, and the only thing remotely getting in the way of that is the theme of ""if you don't get a STEM degree, you won't succeed in life"" that seems so common..."

I'm now going to nursing school, after working several odd jobs that were medical related. I hope to do my MS/PHD in medical anthropology one day (mostly for personal interest reasons), or pursue pathologist's assistant (although finding a job in a desired location may be hard for this). However, I am personally satisfying this interest of mine with my hobby of skeletal articulation and specimen preservation. Plus, if I never see any more cadavers, I think I'll be okay!   It all comes back to Anthropology for me. Nursing kind of came my way because I started volunteering with hospice, and began to transcribe the stories of the dying, their care, and the medical and social culture of death. I have a great interest in the medical field - so I thought, why not? I love it, I enjoy it, and I'm good at it. Let's do it!   I'm not so worried anymore about where my career path will take me. The anthropologist in me always finds a way out. The hard part is finding a career that you like, and can get paid for, whatever field that may be in.

You might not be able to find one in your library because the charts are generally meant to be filled in while using it. Instead of buying one, I'd just try to show up during an archaeologist's or physical anthropologist's office hours at your university and explain what you're trying to do and that you're a dentistry student. You might save yourself some cash if they're willing to loan one to you, or photocopy some relevant charts.

AskAnthropology,35fdk3,EnIdiot,3,Sat May 9 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, some of the earliest anthropological work (by Émile Durkheim) discussed a similar point. He argued that - to put it very simply - society is greater than the sum of its parts. When people come together in social situations, the feeling of togetherness and identity as part of that togetherness comes out of what he called ""effervescence"", which is what makes society. Effervescence can be produced in religious meetings (so in his view, religion produced society and not the other way around), at football matches, all kinds of places really. But he viewed the most basic unit of gathering that produces effervescence as the ""horde"" - although he didn't talk about riots specifically (at least not that I can remember) I think that would be in the same spirit.  That was over a hundred years ago and anthropology has changed a lot since then. I haven't read any works on riots specifically myself so I can't give you much more of an answer than that, but I think it's helpful to understand that yes, ideas like this have been part of anthropology basically since its inception."
AskAnthropology,35fdk3,masungura,2,Sun May 10 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I like the concept of ""Effervescence"" in that it gets to what I think is going on. We are social animals, and we are hard-wired to cooperate in groups. I think rioting must be an extension of this ""effervescence"" (as you noted).  My question is really along the lines of the Milgram experiment. Along with following authority, are we hard-wired to riot and destroy? I'm not looking for a moral excuse as much as I'm looking at how the mechanism of a riot evolves."
AskAnthropology,35bfgh,gravesdigger,25,Fri May 8 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"There has been some work suggesting that the high instances of sexual violence in Papua New Guinea are related to the financial dependancy of women on their husbands and polygamous partners, including bridal dowries etc.  you might want to check out:  ""Violence against women in Papua New Guinea"" by Ione Lewis et al .  There is also no legislation that exists to protect women from being raped by their husbands in PNG.   Other studies have noted that women in PNG are more likely to report instances of sexual violence as there is less social shame associated with being a victim of sexual assault.  There is also some interesting work on Malawi (so take its application to the situation of PNG with a grain of salt) that the spread of global human rights narratives, rather than liberating women from social and economic precariousness, has been applied unevenly along gender lines, serving to alleviate men from their familial obligations and provide them with an increasingly uneven share of new wealth. What has emerged (in Malawi) is a scenario where women are seen as the keepers of traditional culture and their gender roles have been galvanized  (including subservience to male sexual desires) in the face of social change. This has lead to greater economic dependence on men (often multiple men), and as a corollary, a lot of pressure (read strong expectation) for sexual activity.  2013 - “Human Rights Discourse, Gender, and HIV in Southern Malawi.” Anthropologica 55(2):349-358.

East African Expressions of Christianity edited by Spear & Kimambo is good. Especially the chapters by Lema (though not as methodologically rigourous), Waller, and Githieya.  The Limits of Meaning edited by Engelke and Tomlinson also has a couple chapters on African Christianity, particularly the chapters by Bornstein and Engelke.  The Church of Women by Dorothy Hodgson is good. The premise is that missionaries in Masailand thought to target mainly men, being the heads of households, and almost completely ignored women - but now the vast majority of Masai Christians are women.

There is an assumption that more progress, which generally means technological development, is better, and thus people should tend towards greater progress, but this doesn't really hold up on historical or anthropological grounds. Many ""advances"" as deeply central as agriculture and the development of state political systems actually lead to negative outcomes for the great majority. But perhaps even more importantly, many ""advances"" were not done for the aim of concrete benefit. For example, pottery is an extremely useful invention for storage, cooking, carrying water and other necessities of daily life. So you would think that the first thing people did with baked clay would be make pottery, or at least something similarly useful, but in reality in southeast Europe the use of baked clay to make religious figurines precedes its use to make pottery by thousands of years.  So on one level, a reason the Aborigines did not use metal was because there is no natural tendency to develop metalworking. But I think in a narrower sense you could say that there was simply no reason to. The Aborigines had access to obsidian and other stone sources that were actually rather better for their needs than metal equivalents (obsidian is significantly harder and sharper than even surgical steel, and doesn't rust or degrade)."

One could ask the same question of all of mankind for most of the last 100,000 years. Whats of more importance is how it did come about. One of the probable issues with a raft of early technologies being discovered is access to the base resources, access to various pre-cursor technology techniques and knowledge, and a sufficient population density and job diversification to allow someone the time to spend 'discovering' metallurgical methods. A combination of things that were uncommon to Australia. We can only guess at the tiny incremental steps that preceded full blown metal working, for one you need really really hot fires (sp probably a well developed pottery kilning technology, something the Aboriginals also lacked).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age#/media/File:Metallurgical_diffusion.png This map of the bronze age in Europe/ME shows that it seems that the areas central to the continent discovered it first and it spread from there, suggesting that trade and population densities are influential in technology growth. Also Bronze requires copper and tin ores, which are not very common, so you need access to nearby ores or reliable trade routes.  Whilst there were some Aboriginal town communities they were fairly small and undeveloped and just never got to the size and complexity that allowed some of the next steps in technology that Europe/Asia/Africa and American got to."

I read about one group in victoria that had stone huts and remained in one spot, but they lived on and traded eels from a local swamp,  they used hollow trees to smoke the eels, and traps that allowed eels to squeeze through slowly, and they were caught by hand. Very sketchy information though, and they were driven off and the huts demolished very early in the white settlement of australia.

You're not gonna be more native or more legitimate because you're from the north side of the continent or otherwise.   they are descended from the Aztecs   Not all of them, assuming we're speaking about the nationality and not the ethnic group. For example, I'm a ninth-generation Bolivian. However, I'm white as fuck and have no cultural/biological connection (that I'm aware) to any of the hundreds of native groups in my nation.

Best evidence we have, as far as I know ,is what /u/Derpese_Simplex mentioned, evidence of treating head injuries (documented or in skeletal/mummified remains) or writing records in general.

Amy Erickson wrote an interesting article about those titles (especially ""mistress"") and their various derivatives. Published in History Journal Workshop but there's a free copy here: http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/occupations/abstracts/paper25.pdf (although I didn't bother logging in to compare this version with the published version).  Abstract:   The ubiquitous forms of address for women ‘Mrs' and ‘Miss' are both abbreviations of ‘mistress'. Although mistress is a term with a multiplicity of meanings, in early modern England the mistress most commonly designated the female equivalent of master–that is, a person with capital who directed servants or apprentices. Prior to the mid eighteenth century, there was only Mrs (or Mris, Ms, or other forms of abbreviation). Mrs was applied to any adult woman who merited the social distinction, without any marital connotation. Miss was reserved for young girls until the mid eighteenth century. Even when adult single women started to use Miss, Mrs still designated a social or business standing, and not the status of being married, until at least the mid nineteenth century. This article demonstrates the changes in nomenclature over time, explains why Mrs was never used to accord older single women the same status as a married woman, and argues that the distinctions are important to economic and social historians."

Now, IF the Ainu are the descendants of the Jomon (who first inhabited Japan), and considering the Japanese we know today descended from the Yayoi, then the theory that the Yayoi came to Japan via Korea and through Kyushu could be correct. This shift in population would force the Jomon (or at least those who didn't assimilate) to the extremities (Hokkaido and Ryukyu). Those in Ryukyu could eventually take on Japanese as a language, while those in the more secluded north would continue to preserve their language and cultural identity."

The invention of a written language is an event you could talk about, but what is there to say about the lack thereof? Secondly, ethnic and linguistic groups are separate things; it's not like an ethnic group is illiterate just because they don't have an independently-derived writing system. Do black Americans have a written language? The question doesn't make much sense. Generally, writing will be adopted to allow for a centralized bureaucracy; if a foreign writing system is available and accessible, it will be adopted and/or adapted, as that is much, much easier than independently coming up with the idea of writing.  So I hope that helps you think about ""having a written language"" and how it happens, but more directly relevantly, I'm looking through Wikipedia and it seems like there was a Hmong script, but it and other Hmong cultural forms were brutally repressed and lost in the Ming and Qin dynasties. Thus it would've been replaced by Chinese writing systems, and after that (and through Chinese rule) there would be no need to reinvent another writing system.

A summary of its findings for the Yorkshire area:   Between 43 and 100 AD,  the area was one of the most heavily Romanized in Britain, some of that including ""some population movement mostly from Gaul and Rhineland (army veterans settling)."" Between 450 and 500 CE, Angles crossed over and seem to have settled through much of Yorkshire, marrying into local populations and now contributing between 25-50% of DNA in the modern-day average person of Anglo-Saxon descent. ""Some would argue that was because the Anglo-Saxons replaced the existing population, whereas our data shows clear evidence of the Anglo-Saxon DNA, but because it’s in the minority it must have been the case that they inter-married with the existing population."" Part of Yorkshire (far west) remained ""Brythonic-Celtic"" and seems genetically unaffected. Perhaps little to no mixing occurred there. Between 800 and 950 AD, we see Norse migrations to certain areas that are evidenced genetically. This includes especially high concentrations in Orkney, Isle of Man, and along certain coastal areas -- some parts of the west coast of the UK and the east coast of Ireland, as well as one isolated pocket on Ireland's west coast. However, this Norse element doesn't concentrate much in Yorkshire (instead showing a very small presence in a mild west-east gradient), despite there being a high concentration of Scandinavian place names. The other migration in this period that does genetically affect the Yorkshire area is that of the Danes, who came over in around 865 AD. This group seems to have genetically concentrated across Yorkshire and a large portion of the eastern half of England, matching up to the historically-described ""Danelaw"" area."
AskAnthropology,34v961,kingofbeards,2,Tue May 5 06:16:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That was very helpful. Although I do have a question: if one of my lines leads to a place that used to be Danelaw, what is the probability of having Scandinavian descent from that area?"
AskAnthropology,34v961,kingofbeards,5,Tue May 5 06:20:26 2015 UTC,"I think that it would be entirely possible, though I couldn't give you a real probability, given that there are so many other variables at play. Personally, I am of mostly English ancestry (no documented Scandinavian family lines at all) but have about 20% ""Scandinavian"" appearing in genetic ancestry tests, my brother almost 30%. A number of our documented family lines trace back to what would have been within the Danelaw area.   It does make sense when you look into it. ""The Danelaw originated from the Viking expansion of the ninth century AD, although the term was not used to describe a geographic area until the 11th century AD. With the increase in population and productivity in Scandinavia, Viking warriors, having sought treasure and glory in the nearby British Isles, ""proceeded to plough and support themselves"", in the words of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 876.  Danelaw can describe the set of legal terms and definitions created in the treaties between the West-Saxon king, Alfred the Great, and the Danish warlord, Guthrum, written following Guthrum's defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878. In 886 the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum was formalised, defining the boundaries of their kingdoms, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. The language spoken in England was also affected by this clash of cultures with the emergence of Anglo-Norse dialects.  The Danelaw roughly comprises 15 shires: Yorkshire, the Five Boroughs of Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Stamford and Lincoln, as well as Essex, the Kingdom of East Anglia shires of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk, and the East Midlands shires of Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex and Buckinghamshire; in all one third of the total area of the English kingdom at the time."" Link  The invasions that brought about Danelaw would have involved lots of raiders coming over and settling. The raids started by 800 AD but really began to involve Viking settlement when ""in 865, instead of raiding, the Danes landed a large army in East Anglia, with the intention of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. The armies of various leaders had come together to provide one combined force under a leadership that included Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, the sons of the legendary Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok. The combined army was described in the annals as the Great Heathen Army. After making peace with the local East Anglian king in return for horses, the Great Heathen Army moved north. In 867 they captured Northumbria and its capital, York, defeating both the recently deposed King Osberht of Northumbria and the usurper Ælla of Northumbria.   The reasons for the waves of immigration were complex and bound to the political situation in Scandinavia at that time; moreover, they occurred when Viking settlers were also establishing their presence in the Hebrides, Orkney, the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, France (Normandy), the Balticum, Russia and Ukraine (see Kievan Rus').""  In all, if you are really trying to figure out whether you may have Scandinavian descent in these areas, I would investigate linguistically and genetically. What are the etymologies of the surnames and place names that you have traced back to the Danelaw area? If they have any Scandi connections, there is some evidence for you. However, the best way to know is to take a test through something like 23andme, which will confirm it genetically."

And some Native Americans did have writing systems.  At least from what I've studied, the difference seems to be long-distance trade. Complex societies that rely on long distance trade, such as Mesopotamian cities, the Indus River Valley, China, they all developed logographic writing systems fairly early on. It was only later that alphabetic systems developed within areas with logographic and logosyllabic writing systems, and then it was really with the Romans that writing became a widespread thing that ordinary people partook in.  As for Native Americans, the Maya script is logosyllabic and has been deciphered, while the various peoples of Peru had a system of strings and beads that hasn't been deciphered, but was probably used for counting. If we're only talking about North American native societies, then the reason for not having writing is simply because they didn't need it. There's no complex bureaucracy, no major cities, no long distance trade that requires written instruction. But that's only my personal theory."

AskAnthropology,34x6sk,Kryzantine,3,Tue May 5 10:50:57 2015 UTC,"Since there are two comments now, both attempting to correct me with overly simplistic logic, I'll address them here, and explain why I am not changing my comment.  If you want to think of the Americas purely geographically, then the Yucatan peninsula is technically part of North America, because Mexico is technically part of North America. However, the distinction between North America and South America is itself flawed, there are two large continents with a tropical isthmus connecting them, and some people like to split this isthmus in half or split it along the Panama canal. Those people ignore the independent cultural history of the region.  Thus, we have a term called Central America. It largely covers this geographic isthmus and it addresses both the prehistoric and historic cultural uniqueness of the region. If we divide the Americas into North, Central and South America, then Mesoamerica is clearly a part of Central America. Mesoamerica covers the southern part of Mexico all the way down to Costa Rica. This is the Central American heartland. If you want to further argue that, because the Yucatan is a part of Mexico, which is still considered a North American country, then you're tying in a prehistoric society to the modern borders of the state that encompasses it. If the Yucatan peninsula secedes from Mexico - and it historically has - then what would people consider it a part of? It's like limiting your conception of Mesopotamia to modern day Iraqi borders, it's silly.  I use North American and Mesoamerican specifically to highlight the ecological and cultural differences between the two major regions. I suppose I could instead separate the North American Indians into the Pacific Northwest tribes, the Southwest American tribes, the Mississippians, the Fort Ancient culture, the East Coast tribes, so on, but I'm addressing all of them in their umbrella, and contrasting them to cultures in Mesoamerica, who formed complex societies and, in the case of the Maya, who lived in a tropical forest that one cannot find in North America simply by virtue of its geographic northness.  Imagine, instead of dividing Europe up into Northern Europe, Western Europe, Southern Europe, Central Europe and Eastern Europe, a modern system we use to denote cultural boundaries and not geographic ones, we only divided it up into Northern and Southern Europe, or Western and Eastern Europe, or you didn't differentiate at all. Same with South Asia and East Asia - where do you put Thailand or Vietnam in that paradigm?  Do you want to stick with a cultural perspective of geography or a modern state perspective of geography, given we are answering a question of culture?"

AskAnthropology,34r5yt,trumf,19,Mon May 4 09:43:27 2015 UTC,"Natural in this context could be answered by looking at physiology and biomechanics.  These will limit and constrain the range of possibilities.  For instance, I can not fit my whole foot into my mouth nor, despite the colloquialism, could I use my head to deeply stimulate my rectum.  There are natural limits.  Where there are not limits, there may well be constraints which functionally act to disfavor certain positions.  For instance, a female bending over from a standing position to present her vagina while a male enters her doing a handstand.  Some acts may be dis-preferred because more appealing options exist.  Few people use the crook of the neck for male genital stimulation.  Footjobs might also be an example.  Nothing physiologically prevents the prevalence of footjobs but the relative control and dexterity of the hand and mouth would lead to oral and manual stimulation being more likely.  Again, a cultural practice could arise to counteract this ""natural"" tendency but these bodies have their particularities.    Other factors might serve to channel practices into core positions such as strength and endurance.  A male making downward thrusts with feet planted wide while entering a female from behind with her buttocks elevated into the air uses the muscles in the upper leg in a manner that strains them.

You've misunderstood the question as you're talking about history when clearly the question is framed around prehistory and pre-culture through a biological lens.   I would also argue that using bonobos as evidence is incorrect for the spirit of the question.  Bonobos have been known to have sex for pleasure and to barter for goods just as humans do and this is the culture they've created for themselves when they speciated from their standard chimpanzee brethren north of the Congo river. You're talking about oral sex proves that as it's fun but not natural for mating it's just a by product of evolution selecting for sex organs feeling pleasure. Bonobos use sex to trade for goods so they are too advanced (as are we today) for this reductive biological view.  To understand the question you have to look at it like we are biological machines and forget that Nat&sex selection selected for pleasure. E.g. Tortoises naturally mate one way they can't mate face to face so  OP is looking for an answer along the lines of ""woman bent over from behind sex relaxes the uterus allowing deeper thrusting ensuring better semen delivery etc"" or ""this position nearly doubled the rate of female orgasm which leads to cervical pumping leading to greater semen numbers introduced to egg."""
AskAnthropology,34r5yt,GeorgieRRMartin,5,Mon May 4 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"Even regular chimps have a varied method of sex and even do it for pleasure as seen by the unfortunate frogs they masturbate with in zoos.   The reason I chose culture was that by varied sexual positions popping up in multiple areas independent of each other it shows that it is a feature that is common in humans and generally not just do to some unique cultural phenomenon. Beyond that this question could quickly morph into a ""how many angels can fit on the head of a pin"" situation where there are contrasting opinions but no reliable way to falsify any claim. After all I am not aware of any archeological technique that could tell us how adventurous Lucy was in bed."
AskAnthropology,34r5yt,Derpese_Simplex,5,Mon May 4 06:32:59 2015 UTC,"clearly the question is framed around prehistory and pre-culture through a biological lens.   A state that is nonsensical by definition, as all social behavior produces and/or reproduces a certain culture, which even animals have (animals from different zones will display zone-specific behaviors). So, humans as ""biological machines"" doesn't make sense as a concept, and neither do animals as biological machines. All behavior that isn't instinct is learned, otherwise it's developed by experience (unfolding unlimited possibilities), and then, even instincts are performed differently between individuals. Supposing that there is only one way of doing something is a very limited presupposition that's in fact totally invalid in this case.  Of course tortoises mate in a certain position: it's virtually impossible for them to mate in other position, because they have a physical impediment for doing otherwise. In the case of humans, dogs, birds, fish, etc., the possibilities for acting differently are far larger than animals as handicapped as tortoises. Therefore the answer is obvious: whatever is easier for two individuals, and any other possibility out there.  The hypothesis you give imply that the male subject is considering the mentioned factors beforehand (semen delivery, relaxation of uterus, etc.), which is not the case (at least not with a certain degree of biological and reproductive knowledge)."

It is at once broadly focused, so you don't feel overwhelmed by stuff you know you'll forget two pages later, and narrowly focused on some general themes and societies. In school, I was never drawn into the Americas much, but after reading the book I've fallen in love with South America -- it's beautiful and it drew me in because I felt I was learning so much that isn't covered even in my lower level anthropology college classes.

AskAnthropology,34piu9,flytohappiness,8,Sun May 3 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"Height is a difficult characteristic to attribute to one factor. However, here are some that may apply, assuming your statement is true. Firstly, genes do play a role in determining the maximum achievable height for each person, but I suspect that's not the most influential factor at play here. A characteristic of ""western"" growth is good nutrition, which is why we see trends of immigrants to the US and Canada having children who grow taller than their parents. Certain populations in the areas you mention probably have very poor nutrition which impacts their ability to reach their maximum growth potential. That would impact the averages, which in turn lead to the generalization you mention. Another factor that sort of goes along with genes, that kind of explains why a maximum growth potential would be less than in other populations, is the genetic history/environment history. Basically, if you took two individuals with the same level of good nutrition, one might be shorter. That's because sometime in that person's genetic history, there was an advantage to being short and shorter people were more adapted to the environment in some way, therefore they had greater reproductive success. Even if there wasn't necessarily an advantage to being short, just no advantage to being tall. Anyways, genes determine your max height, but nutrition determines what height you actually get to.

Which would explain why that pattern is in a majority of contemporary music, because it is the simplest way to trigger the dopeamine response. If you apply the laws of natural selection to culuture, kick hh snare would be an invasive species, in that once it is intruduced to a group it becomes integrated into their own styles of music.  A good example of this would be modern iranian music, it still uses a lot of the classical elements, but with a heavy 4x4 pattern behind the shuffled drums/percussion. I don't think that is only a result of western influence.  Bringing up the cello was a direct response to you saying the enjoyment of  sub frequencies are a product of a modern culture."

AskAnthropology,34ovj1,Thistleknot,2,Sun May 3 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"The effects of Milankovic cycles are commonly found in the geological record, especially when looking at the distribution of flints and hard-shelled sea life (which is fascinating, I'm sure you'll agree). Whilst these cycles have been a factor in the various ice ages, the original predictions and mathematics do have some problems. From observation and evidence, it would seem that Milankovic cycles don't fully explain periodic climate change, especially when it comes to the severity of the change.  This is fairly unsurprising when you think about it. Earth is host to a series of complex and interwoven dynamic systems. Our proximity to the Sun isn't the only factor in determining our environment, though it surely is a significant one. Climate feedback is an equally major component and, when we're not dealing with climate change over a millennial time scale, the fluctuations that we see from year-to-year aren't readily accessible from pure mathematics.  For about five years in a row, heavy snows fell in London in December. However, this winter just gone has been rather mild. Is that due to a Milankovic cycle? Probably not. Is that significant enough to change how people behave from year to year? I own twice as many gloves and boots as I did in 2010 (Heathrow remains steadfastly unprepared, might I add). These small, unpredictable changes are and have been big contributors to human behaviour.  I think one of the most interesting recent examples of climate migration is the Dirty Thirties (a.k.a The Dust Bowl), and not just because of the entertaining name. In brief, farmers in the mid-west had been overfarming their land using poorly implemented mechanisation. A series of droughts in the 1930s dried out the land and the loose soil left by intensive farming quite readily formed gigantic dust clouds that stretched the breadth of the United States. Thousands upon thousands of people were ruined and fled for the big cities. There's a bunch of information out about the anthropological effects of this migration; the interplay between a series of global political / economic events and this particular story of hardship is about as well understood as it gets.   The Shang dynasty is recognised at being one of the first ""true"" Chinese states and, from what we can date, is the source of the earliest Chinese writing. A drought beset China around 1100BCE and their previously (mostly) amicable neighbours, the Zhou, migrated down from the now arid north and took the Shang lands for themselves. This southward movement of Steppe cultures repeats itself again with the Xiongnu around 100BCE. Though the Xiongnu were ultimately unsuccessful, the cost of keeping them at bay was certainly a factor in the decline of the Han dynasty.  We know sparse details about both these Steppe groups, the Zhou and the Xiongnu, but we can align their rise to prominence with periods of drying. It is these more arid years that may have contributed to the failure of the Mycenaean civilization and the collapse of Augustan Rome, across the other side of the world. As a contrasting point, the Mongolian invasion of, well, the entire world coincided with a period of increased fertility on the Steppe, increasing their supplies of horses and livestock. You just can't win, can you?  It's safe to say that climate change is a major factor in the migration of people in the past. There are numerous, countless examples of a crop failure causing en mass migration, bringing down governments et cetera. Perhaps the Indus and Vinca cultures suffered the same fate. But these events aren't predicted by divining the spinning of the heavens. There are just too many factors to pinpoint some future time at the tip of a Milankovic cycle and say ""here comes trouble""."

Its not hard to find food in the environmenta they live in if you have tens of thousands of years collective knowledge about how to get it. Sure, hunting and gathering can be stressful, but when you know you're skilled enough to get the kill on that animal or you know you're going to find roots and berries, it isn't  a struggle for survival. It's just survival.  Using the bog standard example, the Hadzane ""bushmen"" of Tanzania are often presented with the opportunity to join a more technologically advanced and stratified society. They very rarely do. Why? Because that would require them to work wayyyy more than they already do, which just doesn't fit with their comfort level. Agriculture provides steady food, but it's so bloody time-intensive that on a personal level, it doesn't make much sense. The Hadza often get money from people coming to look at them because of their ""primitive"" ways. They dont have much use for that money, so they spend it all on weed. I'm not kidding. Self-gratification in hunter-gatherer societies carries very little social stigma. You can literally do what makes you happy. Oh, and plus, men and women are equal.

AskAnthropology,34i6eh,veganmarshmallows,14,Fri May 1 10:56:11 2015 UTC,"Without any of the relevant data from the excavation I would say these are fairly modern. The style doesn't fit any known cultures that I know of from that area, not to mention the actual cuts on the stone look fairly modern. It appears that there is undercutting around the hand which is usually indicative of modern stone cutting. As far as ballast goes, most ballast tends to be rather small as you want to be able to get rid of it easily when you load a ship. If you look at many of the old port towns like Charleston, Boston and the like you will see many of their older buildings and roads are actually constructed out of ballast. An easy way to help identify if this was a ballast is to identify the stone and compare it to your local geology. If its a local stone, it's likely not ballast. It's really hard to try to get the detail one needs for a complete analysis through photographs. What kind of tool marks are on it? Anything that looks a drill was used? Especially on the backside where all the cross hatching is at. Also any information such as the depth it was located at and any other artifacts found in conjunction with it? I hope that helps, if you find out more data let us know."

I would agree that it is highly likely to be fairly modern- maybe late 19th to mid 20th c.?. They seems to have been shaped with a variety of stone working tools. It could have been someone's experiments with stone sculpting.   Even if it's not of significant antiquity, this seems like it could be a very interesting local historical project. As the user above suggested, comparing the stone to the local geology is a good place to start. Also, perhaps check local records to see who owned the land before the hotel."

AskAnthropology,34iuth,tartmechanic,7,Fri May 1 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would say ""totally,"" but it certainly played a large roll in America in the 19th century. So when The Origin of Species was published, it totally changed how everyone thought about how humans were created. It cast a lot of doubt on well, everything. Now we know we were descended from apes and although from a modern standpoint we would assume this would make everyone equal, but among the elite it was quite the opposite.  Consider phrenology, the study of the shape of the skull. Certainly the shape of an average Anglo-Saxon is different from that of an African or an American Indian. The deduction of studying the differences amongst these shapes was that the white-man's head was the be-all end-all of evolution. The white brain was fully evolved and formed, so any head or brain shape differing from that shape was lesser, unreformed, incomplete. It gave people a reason to use Africans as slaves and push Natives off of their land. ""Well, their heads aren't like ours but ours are the most evolved and that coincides with Darwinism so there.""  I wrote my senior thesis on Social Darwinism and representation of Natives in art, when artists started refining their skills in the sciences and were depicting the world with the thought of natural sciences in the back of their mind.  Some examples are George Catlin and Frederic Church. Americans really needed to continue to justify their superiority in light of new scientific findings.  EDIT: i tried to access my senior thesis information but my harddrive crashed last summer and I don't believe I have it anymore, unfortunately. All of my sources were either books or articles from JSTOR. If you're very interested two of my favorites were Tropical Renaissance by Katherine Manthorne and Nature and Culture by Barbara Novak."
AskAnthropology,34iuth,Lucian_Gregory_,3,Fri May 1 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Not being and expert, but on what reading I have done of 19th century scientific literature, there were many thinkers who had a more 'enlightened' view of other racial and 'indigenous' groups. To take an example, in Darwin's voyage of the beagle, although dismissive of the cultural achievements of the natives of Tierra del fuego, at no point does he suggest that they are inherently inferior than Europeans, simply that they have not reached the same level of development. This thread of thinking is consistent in many of his observations about the native tribes in south America.  Similarly, if you look at 'the golden bough' by Frazer (nicknamed the father of anthropology) you'll see that he views tribal beliefs as primitive precursors of the religions of more developed societies. So in summary, although these people had little regard for the value of these cultures, they didn't think that these people were inherently inferior, just that circumstances had prevented to them from achieving what they believed to be the cultural zenith of European civilisation. It's not racist in the strict sense, but perhaps a little arrogant."
AskAnthropology,34iuth,tartmechanic,2,Fri May 1 21:27:44 2015 UTC,"I know that Catlin and Church (two artists I focused on) and many other artists were in awe of Native culture. Especially Catlin, who writes of them having hunting style similar to those of early Greeks and Romans. Knowing how highly Europeans regarded these cultures, that's pretty impressive.  I guess I wouldn't mean to say that all artists and anthropologists thought of them as inferior because many artists regarded them. But even in Catlin's letters there are hints of his feeling of superiority.  But I am certain that many elites, aristocrats, and politicians used the new discovery of Evolution as, in ways, propaganda against other races!  EDIT: Okay I sifted through my old emails and actually found a draft of the paper that I sent my boyfriend! So the source where I found all the info about Phrenology and how people used this against other races was from ""Territory, Race, Religion: Images of Manifest Destiny"" by Matthew Baigell, Smithsonian Studies in American Art Vol. 4 No. 3 (1990)"
AskAnthropology,34iuth,Lucian_Gregory_,2,Fri May 1 22:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, unfortunately a lot of that admiration was of the 'noble savage' variety which is a little patronising, and I think even the enlightened thinkers believed it was for the best that these cultures conformed to European modes of behaviour to insure progress.  When it comes to the actual racial theorists, I've always thought of them as hacks who spouted  pseudo-scientific nonsense to support a political agenda.  It'd be interesting to know how many were truly earnest in their beliefs and how many were corrupt.  You could ask a similar question about modern climate-change skeptics."

Bread is so widespread because it's a cheap, voluminous, available means of delivering carbohydrates. Also because wheat, and its grassy relatives, are found widely around the world.  Cultures that do not eat plentiful bread (Eastern Asia, Americas) surely have a substitute that's equally as prevalent in their cuisine, such as rice, corn, quinoa, or whatever."
AskAnthropology,34fgnt,hpliferaft,12,Fri May 1 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Also because wheat, and its grassy relatives, are found widely around the world.   This is backwards.

This just isn't true. There's no such thing as a essential carbohydrate (like there are fats and amino acids). The small amount of glucose the body needs it can synthesize itself through gluconeogenesis. What bread is however is a very cheap and efficient way of fueling the body with energy.  Edit: Noticed you wrote 'organisms' and not humans. Some organisms most probably need carbs to survive. Humans are not one of them though."
AskAnthropology,34fgnt,ikiosho,1 point,Fri May 1 07:11:07 2015 UTC,"Does gluconeogenesis produce enough glucose for the active lifestyle of early humans though? I imagine that while it's sufficient to survive, humans would need to supplement that through intake of dietary carbohydrates. Also, gluconeogenesis has to produce glucose from some other carbohydrate, right?  I'm not trying to prove you wrong, I'm just not well informed on this process."
AskAnthropology,34fgnt,NowNowMyGoodMan,1 point,Fri May 1 07:26:24 2015 UTC,"The body doesn't need to get its energy from glucose.

AskAnthropology,34fgnt,NowNowMyGoodMan,1 point,Fri May 1 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"They got somewhere around 10 g of carbohydrates per day which is about 40 kcal worth of energy. For reference an adult mans BMR is somewhere around 2000-2500 kcal. The brain needs somewhere around 400-500 kcal so if the brain only uses glucose for energy (which I'm not sure of) the carbs from the meat wouldn't suffice.  Edit: Also, we can only store a couple of thousands of kcal as glycogen but vastly more as fat. When someone is fasting or starving they quickly run out of glycogen. If we weren't able to synthesize the glucose we need from fat there would be now way for us to supply our brains with energy after a few days without food."

For example, I was told once by a friend that there are villages all over the world where their governments salt the soil so they can't grow crops in order to force them to buy from the market. I would like to help problems like that."
AskAnthropology,34f6pr,Fishing-Bear,6,Thu Apr 30 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Firstly, a lot of professional anthropologists hold ethical qualms about intervening in the political situation surrounding their subjects. I am not one of those anthropologists, but keep in mind that you will face some finger-wagging should you use anthropology as a means to enact social reform.    As an anthropologist, you could definitely conduct field work in ""third world"" countries, however, fieldwork (especially fieldwork in places/ on topics of one's own choosing) is an opportunity usually realized while dissertating or during one's employ as a professional anthropologist. This means a long commitment to academia, and a long commitment to academia is no guarantee of meaningful employment. You say you don't care about money, but think long and hard about what 10+ years of poverty level wages would mean for you. PhDs aren't a license to print money...they're probably closer to wearing a big sign that says ""exploit my labour!"".   There are, of course, opportunities external to the academy where you could do the type of work you're seeking. Working for an NGO, working for the UN etc. These positions are rare and hard to get with only a BA, and they are not exclusive to anthropology. The UN has an internship programme for graduate/post-graduate students, but they are unpaid and you are responsible for most (if not all) of your expenses. A little anecdote: a visiting scholar (and UN officer) came in to give a talk one day in a graduate seminar I was in. They were there to promote the internships and talk about all the wonderful (unpaid) employment opportunities at the UN. Our prof calmly raised her hand and said ""so what you're saying is that these opportunities are for rich kids?"". There was some awkward laughing and the powerpoint continued. Existing in Geneva without an income is unrealistic for a lot of people.   All that being said, I love anthropology and think that it is valuable in the context you're describing. I do, however, reiterate my conviction that your interests are closer to investigative journalism than to anthropology, and a degree in journalism or communication would get you to your goals more directly than anthropology."
AskAnthropology,34f6pr,brigantus,5,Thu Apr 30 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally anthropology is a science not an applied discipline. Anthropologists do go on ""expeditions"" of the type you seem interested in, but our goal is to understand people and their societies, not affect change. At least not directly. Anthropological research often informs activism and development work, and lots of people might get into the third sector off the back of an anthropology degree, but if you know right now that you're more interested in the applied side than the science side there are other subjects that are probably a better fit: development studies, political science, journalism; sociology or economics even, since they have a more developed applied tradition."
AskAnthropology,34f6pr,masungura,3,Fri May 1 07:20:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll be the jerk here and say, ""3rd world countries"" do not need another person like this. There are already tons of them, and there have been for years and years. That's not to say that there aren't any foreigners having genuinely helpful partnerships with local social justice (or whatever) organisations in the global south. There are. But they tend to come out of actual friendships between people that were already friends. They don't come out of itinerant ""experts"" showing up with their latest idea to save everyone. As often as not, the local response to that is, ""oh God, another one? Smile and nod and get him out of here ASAP so we can get on with what we were doing.""  Sure, feel free to start studying anthropology - I obviously think highly of it or I wouldn't have done it myself. I'm just telling you, you'll find out two things: 1) Anthropology doesn't do the type of thing you're talking about, although sometimes it studies that type of thing; and 2) The type of thing you're talking about can actually be really problematic.  I don't mean to be a total killjoy, I respect that people have good intentions.

AskAnthropology,348bkk,Plasmodicum,150,Wed Apr 29 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"This is my job. However the way I do it won't be the same as everyone else who does it, so if you're curious and don't get many answers here you might also want to try in /r/linguistics where we have a lot of people working in language documentation.  The problem with this kind of task when all the speakers are old as you say is that you're never going to get a full record, because there's just not enough time. Additionally if you're attached to a university, most will have ethics guidelines that will not allow you (because it's unethical) to speak with really frail speakers. This is meant to protect them from you hassling them on their deathbed, however some speakers will still want to talk to you because preserving their language is important to them. Anyway not enough time, and sometimes even less time depending on the ethics requirements.  The other issue is that there are so many things that need to be documented and it's impossible to really cover them all in a single lifetime. There are linguists who spend 30 years on one language (though that's not always the normal situation). These are excellent cases because maybe they wrote a full grammar for the language, and then 30 years they can go back and re-write and fix what they got wrong the first time around. Still, not the norm, and the pressures of academia are a very real hinderance to this sort of thing.  Generally what that means is you pick one thing. A common approach is to go in with the goal of writing a descriptive grammar. This is a work (often a PhD thesis or a book) that will try to explain all the important grammatical things about the language, and often also include a substantial vocabulary list. This language has a subject-object-verb word order, for example, or this language requires verbal agreement, or demands negative concord, or this language has vowel harmony that works in a quirky way and here's how it works. These are often the first things that get published about any given language, because it's so fundamentally foundational.  A good way to do this obviously requires you physically being there for a period of months or years. You talk to a lot of people, make a lot of recordings, try to work out the fundamentals like phonology, if it's tonal and if so what are the tones, figure out the basic sentence structure and so on. You also probably have a pretty substantial background in the field already and are familiar with a lot of other languages so you have good points of comparisons. Maybe you notice something about how sentences are structured when it's a yes/no question, and you've also learned about another language like Arabic that does something similar, so now you have a hypothesis to test: Does it work the same? You then formulate a tonne of examples to see if they work or not, working with native speakers. A lot of times word lists are used and you're literally just going ""how do you say dog? okay how about cat? okay how about big dog?"" and work out patterns from that.  You may also get them to tell a story. There are a few stories that are absurdly common. The North Wind and the Sun is an incredibly common example since it's a story that might be already known to the speakers. In Asia we tend to see The Frog in the Well more commonly. I personally skip these and am more interested in them telling a story from their own lives, but of course this can also get you different results than a well known story. Both are useful in different ways.  Ultimately what you're doing is data collection, then analysis, forming a hypothesis, gathering more data based on that hypothesis and then investigating whether or not your hypothesis proves accurate, and if not, you try to figure out why not and then go back in to do more data collection. All the while you're also trying to describe this in a way that will help other scholars, but also in a way that will help the people of the community. Maybe Grandma speaks it but you don't and you want to learn because it's the language of your people. So a big part of the job is also trying to enable them to maintain the language, or even just have a record of it for future generations.  Hope that helps answer your question. It's a big question to answer, so this is just a start. Let me know if you have other follow up questions and I'll try to answer."

AskAnthropology,348bkk,keyilan,19,Wed Apr 29 10:04:45 2015 UTC,"What sort of stuff would be of interest? It's a little hard for me to judge because the things I think are most interesting might only be interesting to someone pretty deep into the field but not that interesting to non-linguists.  One thing that I think might have some common appeal is just the sheer diversity of tone systems. Tone is something a lot of people are unfamiliar with if they don't speak a tonal language, so it's usually a good thing to talk about.  A lot of people might be superficially familiar with the notion of tones in languages like Mandarin, where a high-toned ""ma"" has a different meaning than a low tone ""ma"". There are only just over 400 different possible syllables in Mandarin, but then by adding 4 or 5 different tones, and by having most words be two syllables, you've suddenly expanded that to a huge number of possible combinations, so mālǎ or mǎlà or málá are all potentially different words.  But then looking at different dialects of Mandarin, we see different tone systems emerge. Tianjin dialect is one of the more well known, and the system is so different from Beijing (which is very nearby, geographically) that the dialect is often given to linguistics graduate students as homework for them to try to work out how it works based on raw data.  Then look at other related languages, you start to realise that Standard Mandarin is actually even simpler than you thought, and things can get much more complex and in very unique and interesting ways. For example tone in Shanghainese, which is a dialect of another language called Wu that is realted to Mandarin, words very differently. You get ""tone melodies"" where the tone of the first syllable determines the pattern of the tones in the other syllables in each word. So if L M and H are for low middle and high You might see a two syllable word like laL laH, but then a three syllable word starting in the same first-syllable tone is laL laH laM, a four syllable might be laL laH laM laL and a five syllable might be laL laH laM laM laL. The important thing is that it does not matter what the other tones are after the first one, as long as these are all in the same word. Most words aren't really that long, but if one were, the pattern is completely predictable based on the very first syllable, and since there are only 5 tones in Shanghainese, that means that there are generally only 5 patterns for words with 2 syllables, 5 patterns for words with 3 syllables and so on. I'm over-simplifying a little bit but the general idea is there. Note that this is completely different from Standard Mandarin where tones typically don't change no matter where the syllable is in a word, with very few exceptions.  Another dialect of Wu, spoken very close to Shanghai, gets even weirder because instead of 5 tones there are 12, and the system in Shanghai turns out to be one of the simplest in the whole Wu language.  Meanwhile in Taiwanese the system is still completely different, and is probably a little more complex than I should get into here.  And then Cantonese has another different way of handling tones.  These are all still Chinese (Sinitic) languages, and they differ substantially from other Sinotibetan languages, but then those are yet different from Tai-Kadai languages and others in the area.  Then on top of that you have to remember that a huge number of the world's languages include tones, and the systems they operate on tend to be shockingly different even among related languages, so you can imagine how different they get when you move to completely unrelated languages like Seoul Korean (which is becoming tonal since around the 1960s or 70s) and some dialects of Dutch, or languages in America or Africa which also have tone and clearly not because of any shared ancestry.  I've been doing a lot of ""leisure"" reading on tone recently, so that's probably why it's on my mind right now. I could just as easily talk about the myths about how Chinese languages are all the same when written (they are not) and how they're really just differences in pronunciation (they are not), and some of the weird stuff you see in character differences, but since I've also written about that fairly recently maybe just linking to that is easier.  I also do a fair amount dealing with efforts at language preservation both by governments as well as at the grassroots level, as well as minority language rights and national language planning and policy. I actually did a podcast with /r/AskHistorians back in December if that interests you, though I feel kinda bad subjecting people to my voice for an hour."
AskAnthropology,348bkk,Axon350,2,Wed Apr 29 13:36:09 2015 UTC,"The tones of Chinese tend to be dipping, rising/falling, and level, right? Chinese dialectology is really interesting to me but I speak garbage Mandarin so I'm pretty limited at the moment in terms of the kind of things I can read about it. A while ago I looked for lists of tone systems and I found a few, but really not many at all. Are you aware of any tones in the Sinitic languages that are rising-falling like in Thai, or 'broken' (glottal stop) like in Vietnamese?   How do you feel about checked tones being counted as separate tones, in say Cantonese where nobody can seem to agree on the number?   Can you link me any of the research or notable authors on tonogenesis in Korean and Dutch? I'm aware of the development of pitch accent in some European languages, but are people starting to separate that from a new phenomenon?"
AskAnthropology,348bkk,keyilan,4,Wed Apr 29 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"The tones of Chinese tend to be dipping, rising/falling, and level, right?    Yeah, more or less. Imagine 1 is low and 5 is hight, so fourth tone is like 51. It's a steep fall. The dipping tone then is usually called 213 in text books, but in reality it is usually just realised as low tone like 21. This is even more common in Taiwan where you rarely ever hear anyone do the full dip. The level tone, first tone, is 44 or 55. It's high. That's important in Mandarin because you can't do 22 or 33 and expect it to be taken as correct, while in some other languages ""level"" is the important feature and ""high"" is an optional part of that, so a low level tone will still be acceptable. If that makes sense.  The ""broken"" you talk about actually happens on 3rd tone in Mandarin in China (but really almost never in Taiwan in my experience), and is more common with younger female speakers (again, in my experience).   I have encountered the rise-fall tone as well, and while it's less common it's still fairly easy to fine. The dialect of Wu spoken in Haiyan in Northern Zhejiang province (south of Shanghai) has this kind of contour on two of the tones, the yinshang and yangshang tone categories to be precise. In Southern Zhejiang province in a different dialect group of Wu, you also find this in places like Yunhe and Songyang. It exists in the dialect of Hakka spoken in Wuping, Fujian province as well, as a non-Wu example. So yeah it most definitely exists throughout China, but since Wu is more of my specialty that's what I can more readily give data for.  As an additional example not from Sinitic, there's a Tibeto-Burman language called Guiqiong which has this rise-fall even more clearly made, for example the word for ""horse"" in the Qianxi dialect is mbu352. It's sometimes recorded as just 35 in the literature, but according to audio data collected by a researcher named Wang Feng in 2008, it's very clearly a strong rise-fall.   How do you feel about checked tones being counted as separate tones, in say Cantonese where nobody can seem to agree on the number?   Checked tones are 100% different tones, and not just in Chinese (Sinitic) languages. The issue with Cantonese about no one agreeing is more due to the fact that there are 8 tones in the traditional system, and Cantonese has split one of those, and then there are potential other variations on those 9. So the problem is not really a question about if the checked tones should be taken as separate tones. Instead the question is if two tones that are very similar and in predictable distribution should be treated as variations on a single tone category or if they should be taken as separate tones.  Cantonese is actually one of my weakest areas, despite its relative popularity among language learners, so I should probably not get too much deeper into that topic; I really haven't put in the time to speak to the specifics.   Can you link me any of the research or notable authors on tonogenesis in Korean and Dutch? I'm aware of the development of pitch accent in some European languages, but are people starting to separate that from a new phenomenon?   Kang Yoonjung has been doing a fair amount of recent work on it, but it's been attested since the 1960s. Here's a powerpoint, a paper and shorter paper  In Dutch note that it's not really ""becoming tonal"" in the same sense. Rather there's a single group of dialects that make a tonal distinction on certain words, e.g. ""bánk"" vs ""bànk"". Thus it's really treated more as pitch accent and only happens on certain words, and is largely isolated to Limburg. Here's a brief introduction to a study and a very short overview of the Weert dialect (spoken in Limburg) that mentions the pitch accent system. You can google ""pitch accent in Dutch"" for more on that."

It was created to be intentionally confusing as a sort of language game, and really not meant as an actual documentation of how Mandarin actually works. The writing style is neither the colloquial that was coming into fashion at the time of writing, nor was it the historical literary language (which was really only a written language and not actually spoken in the past few centuries if not millennia). So that's actually a bad example of crazy things happening in language.

I started by working through the rapid word collection method used by SIL, then moved on to doing grammar as much as possible as I worked my way through everything. I've really focused on data collection for now, shooting for a corpus based documentation, so record record record hundreds and hundreds of hours of language, trying for every different type of speech possible, on every subject and every context I can think of.  The SIL resources give one approach to systematicity, but there are a lot of other things out there as well, such as simply talking through a year in someone's life (seasonal activties, people they'd meet, converstaions they'd have or remembered having).  Then comes finding stories, ideally stories that may have heard!  I got so much just this week through triggering elders to remember stories that they could only remember in part in Nuxalk, but mostly in English - the little bits of Nuxalk they could remember including a new way of counting tens! As well as talking about dealing with bad winds and the impact of wind on boats (has a lot of words and expressions and uses of words I hadn't encountered before and weren't in any previous documentation).    So much more to say - but the biggest thing I'd add is that working with old people has been amazing, for both me and for them.  I worked a woman who was in the early stages of dementia, couldn't remember things, had to have everything repeated, and so on.  After six months of recording with her a few hours a day, it had reversed, almost entirely as far as I could tell, to where her memory was far better, and this went beyond just language, which is a miracle in itself, watching a language return to an old speaker who hasn't used it in fifty years."

AskAnthropology,348bkk,l33t_sas,8,Wed Apr 29 19:42:54 2015 UTC,"There's a few basic misapprehensions at play here.  The first is that 'should of' and 'should have' and 'then' vs 'than' are just orthographical errors, not really linguistic errors. When you're doing language documentation you're looking at the language, not the writing which is just a visual representation of the language. Botanists don't study plants by looking at photos of them, they actually go out and look at the plants. So it is for linguists and writing.  The second misapprehension you have is that linguists do not talk about 'errors' in the same way that you might think. If we want to go back to our botanist analogy, the average person might have a mental image of corn as a yellow vegetable. They might look at a blue corn and say ""Hey, that's not real corn! That's not how proper corn should be!"" Linguists view bare adverbs like 'real good' instead of 'really good' the same way as botanists view blue corn. It doesn't matter that certain people might have ideologies of what corn should actually be, the fact is that 'real good' is a naturally occuring expression frequently used by native English speakers so we as linguists will treat it the same way as any other expression. Linguists (sociolinguists in particular) are interested in attitudes towards language, so we might note down that an expression is 'non-standard' or 'perceived by some as incorrect' but we don't make judgements on whether something is correct or not in that sense and we certainly don't exclude them from our descriptions on that basis. We do talk about 'errors' in other contexts though, like when someone meant to say something but actually said something else. Some of these errors even have different names, like spoonerisms but that kind of error is fundamentally different to what you're thinking of."

Is a dialect considered less important to retain than a fully distinct language? Or are there just so many, we'll never save them all, so researchers are encouraged to just choose one based on their preference?"
AskAnthropology,348bkk,keyilan,6,Wed Apr 29 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing really as a distinct language vs a dialect. Objectively speaking, there's no objective different between the two things, no way to draw the line between what is a dialect and what is a language. Those are distinctions made on sociopolitical bases, not linguist ones.  However you've basically hit the nail on the head: They all need attention, and there just aren't enough linguists to do that, and you can't tell people to be interested in something other than what they're interested in. You can encourage work on certain things, and of course this happens a lot in graduate programs where many times the students have some project relating to work done by one of the faculty members. For example I've done work on Taiwan's aboriginal languages even though I've never had any particular interest in them, simply because it was the focus of one of the professors there and therefore was the focus of the class that she taught. As a result, some of my fellow grad students (masters level) shifted their focus to that language group because now they had exposure and thought it was interesting. That sort of thing, getting exposure and branching out, happens often enough. Maybe I work on some Chinese language but a friend of mine wants help with a project they're doing on a native American language, so then I end up working with them on some part of their project, and then down the road I end up doing more with that language as it relates to my other area of work. That happens fairly often as well, and it's one of the reasons a lot of people who've been doing this for decades have worked quite deeply on more than one language.  But it's never finished, and ultimately you do the most work on the things you find most interesting, and fortunately for many people ""most interesting"" is defined as ""most in need of attention"", so it does tend to work out more or less, given the ultimate lack of resources (linguists and funding)."

Bob now enrols in English courses at the local college and picks it up quickly. Now X is dead?   If that's what you mean then no I would not agree.  A language is dead when there are no longer native speakers, who are inherently capable of providing their knowledge and intuition if they so please.  Otherwise, no currently critically endangered languages are actually still alive since their speakers generally all know another language, so then the classification of ""dead"" loses all useful meaning."
AskAnthropology,348bkk,calangao,10,Thu Jul 9 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"Language Documentarian here.   In fact many of the world's languages are currently endangered. Of the world's approximately 6,000-7,000 languages, linguists predict that 50% of them will be extinct within a century (some linguists predict much more severe language loss).  The process of conducting a language documentation project is different from language to language as communities are different and linguists are trained in different ways as well (linguistics actually has many competing theoretical schools). I can give you a general rundown of some things you would expect in a language documentation project.  First the linguist will find a suitable language. Languages with few speakers often get special priority. The linguist will likely then seek community support, ethics approval, research permits and funding (grants). The grant is a crucial step, there is no corporate profit in language documentation and so with no grant there is no hope of documenting the language.  Once the language is set and the funding is provided the project really starts. The linguist will conduct a series of field trips, often ammounting to more than a year total with the community. During this phase data will be collected through both targeted elicitation and the collection of texts. The targeted elicitations will usually be aimed at completing paradigms for grammatical and phonological analysis. The texts will be stories, conversations, perhaps instructions. Texts might reveal interesting things that the linguist couldn't know to elicit and can focus  on once they are brought to the surface. It is often hard to prepare for what might need to be collected from an undescribed language.  The specifics of what is elicited in what order and what it takes to form and analysis are very in depth topics and quite often language and situation specific. But generally one would start with word lists and work their way up to sentences and texts.   The archiving of the data is also a very important aspect. There are archival organizations like DOBES and PARADISEC which run online databases. The archiving is crucial so that future linguists can access the data for scientific purposes and communities and descendants will have records of the language for cultural purposes.  In addition to documentation and description, linguists also help organize revitalization and maintenance efforts for endangered languages when it is appropriate (it is only really appropriate if it is the initiative of the community).

However the symbolic formalisation of romantic relationships (marriage) has in many places been denied to these new combinations. When you start to deny from some people what a lot of other people have then there arises new arguments to protest against that. Hence it is now being considered by many as a 'right' REGARDLESS of the gender combination involved.

The ""forbidden"" part of R&J (denying arranged marriage) is not up for debate anymore, as even the staunchest conservative in America believes mates should be free to date and choose amongst themselves.  R&J was forbidden because the society practiced arranged marriage, and the eligible youth in well-to-do families had huge political and economic value that the families themselves controlled. R&J essentially ""stole"" from their families by refusing the culture of arranged marriage and refusing to help their families politically and economically through the institution of marriage.   I point it out because arranged marriage and family control of relationships was a staple throughout the majority of western history and remains a normal practice in many other parts of the world today."

It's tempting to imagine that the reasons prehistoric people did the things they did were somehow mystical or 'connected', such as that they buried people to re-unite them with the world, but let's also remember that they were probably really well adapted to their lifestyle and really practically thinking. Since you're not eating your dead ones (in most cases anyway), having their bodies around rotting or attracting scavengers is no good, so burying or burning it is fairly practical and straight forward.  So, yes, any time we're imagining why some people do something, don't forget that people are often just very practical. Sure, there's heaps of interesting and weird things we and everyone does, but most of it is just straight forward and practical within our habitus and milieu and all that."

AskAnthropology,3400nd,BAMFSoB,42,Mon Apr 27 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"The earliest domesticated species (when I last paid attention to this) was at Abu Hureyra (in Syria) - where domesticated rye was dated to around 9500-9000 BCE.   At the time I studied this, it was the earliest known plant domesticate in the world - but there may have been some earlier finds since.   edit: checked date and corrected it - more information available from the obvious sources (wiki) and pretty much every reader on prehistory possible - I checked in Scarre's The Human Past.

AskAnthropology,3400nd,Solivaga,15,Mon Apr 27 10:11:23 2015 UTC,"You are a little bit out of date. The earliest domesticated plants are found at a number of sites in the Near East dated to between 8,500–8,000 BCE: 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan; Tell Aswad in Syria; Kissonerga-Mylouthkia and Shillourokambos on Cyprus; and Asikli Hoyuk, Cafer Hoyuk and Cayonu in Turkey. Tell Abu Hureyra is still a very early, and one of the best documented, example of the Epipalaeolithic–Neolithic transition, but secure evidence of domestic crops there only goes back to 8,000 BCE. Hillmans' identification of domestic rye there is problematic and isn't corroborated elsewhere; rye is very rare in the Neolithic Near East, and it looks like it was actually domesticated much later, in northern Anatolia.  But more to the point, the ""earliest domesticated species"" doesn't really tell you much. We know that domestication was a drawn out process, where species acquired the telltale phenotypic markers of domestication (like the nonshattering spikelets you mentioned below) over thousands of years. Only at the very end of the process can you find plants that are identifiably domesticated. But by that point people had been deliberately cultivating them for many hundreds of generations.  So to get back to the OP's question: we can't say what the very first plant people started cultivating was, because people started cultivating many plants around the same time, and at first this didn't leave much of a trace in the archaeological record. But here's a nice chart of what crops up when. As you can see, the earliest cereal crops were emmer wheat, einkorn wheat and barley; but legumes (lentils, peas and chickpeas) were also very early cultivars. Flax is also very old, but that was grown for to be woven, not eaten.   We can say for certain that corn (maize) is way out of contention – it's a New World crop, and farming didn't get started there until several thousands years after it began in Southwest Asia.

Think they were new scientist articles, but it was ages ago, so correct me if I'm wrong.  Edit. From wikkipedia "" In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at Cayonu and Mureybet developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the Zarzian culture of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).

AskAnthropology,3400nd,0ldgrumpy1,19,Mon Apr 27 11:40:44 2015 UTC,"Interestingly you've actually gotten the domestication process of grains the wrong way around.  The loss of natural or ""self"" seed dispersal was one of the primary or key shifts in plant characteristics during domestication;   ‘...wild wheats and barley have fragile spikes, and their ears disarticulate immediately upon maturity. The fragility of the spike is, in fact, the main diagnostic character that serves for distinction of wild cereals from their cultivated counter-parts. But what is less emphasized is that brittleness is only the most conspicuous reflection of one of the major adaptations of these wild cereals to their wild environment: their specialization in seed dispersal.’ (Zohary 1969: 57–58)   Basically, early gatherers/farmers wanted plants where most of the grains on the head were mature and ready for harvesting.  However, plants with fragile or weak rachis would shatter during harvesting, and the grains would be lost.  In contrast, strains with tough rachis were non-shattering, and so most of the grain would remain on the head during collection.  Over time this resulted in the selective propagation of plants with tougher rachis, resulting in the modification of the strains of barley, wheat etc. that were being collected and eventually planted.   edit: Very good detailed look at this here: SEED DISPERSAL AND CROP DOMESTICATION: SHATTERING, GERMINATION AND SEASONALITY IN EVOLUTION UNDER CULTIVATION by Dorian Q.

And what does it mean to not be civilized?  I think the concept is more trouble than it's worth, quite literally, and I would discard it entirely. If you define civilization as permanent settlement and agriculture, you're not explaining much or clarifying anything with the definition, just putting a label on it that is meaningless at best and denigrating and excluding at worst. This and similar concepts ring close to discussion from before the mid 20th century, where scientists had a neat classificatory system and checklists to divide peoples into savages, barbarians and civilized people. Themselves, the scientists, of course being civilized, and the people their countries more often than not were or had colonized, were either savages or barbarians, all according to good science.   Besides, you run into a circular logical argument doing this, which is what makes the concept meaningless. If these things define civilization, does the concept imply anything else? Is there a correlation between these things and, say, the complexity of the culture and kinship system, the sophistication of their art or language and religions? If yes, you'd have to find some very strong arguments for that, if no, the concept is fairly meaningless and only means these two things, agriculture and permanent settlement.  I don't say this to talk down to you or be too hard on you, only to explain what I think is a fairly common standpoint, at least where I've studied anthro, on concepts such as these. So I'd say that at least within anthropology, there isn't really a non-loaded, PC definition of this concept because academics don't use it.

Although, the module is designed for both Geog. and Anthro. students, and the question specifally asks how much influence did climate have on the ""dawn of civilisation"". Whatever I may define the term as, I would need some evidence that can be dated, or something that we can say 'appeared around here on the timeline', (on a large scale) in order to compare it to the appropriate climatic events.   I agree that defining when we became 'civilised' or 'modern' is a problematic and un-PC concept (much like the history of anthropology), and that if there was a definition it would more likely be related to much more romantic traits such as the ones you suggest, but how would we measure the sophistication of kinship systems in the archaeological record? If there's a point where we can say, this is when things seem to change, on a mass scale, according to the evidence we find, then you could compare it to climatic events and check for any correlation.  Agriculture or full time-sedentism appear around 10,000BP, (on a mass scale) at the same time in several places round the world, and within 10,000 years we were on the moon....  I know this concept is obviously not this simple, and that if it were to be defined I personally would define it as a gradual, complex and multi-faceted process, involving millions of years of growing social complexity, gradual sedentism, increasing population and technological change, that couldn't simply be allocated to one single cause. But ultimately, when addressed in this way, there is evidence to suggest that climate was a major player in this process.  Maybe the question is in-answerable, but if you had to construct an effective argument using both climatic data, archaeological evidence, as well as anthropological thought surely this would be the best way of going about it."

AskAnthropology,33wuvb,diporasidi,13,Sun Apr 26 11:51:55 2015 UTC,"Linguistically, ""Semitic"" refers to Arabic, Hebrew and related languages. Socially, as in ""antisemitic"" it's pretty squarely limited to Jewish people. The grouping of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are usually just called ""Abrahamic"", and ""Judeo-Christian"" when one wants to exclude Islam. I can't say I've encountered ""Semitic religion"" as a term used by serious scholars on the Middle East. I say this as someone who did their undergrad in Middle Eastern theology and also a closely related masters, and not just some shmuck who once saw a tv show on Islam.  Does the author use it frequently? If so, look at their earliest use of it in the text and that should clear it up, either through context or an explicit definition."
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,keyilan,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:58:20 2015 UTC,"So ""Semitic religion"" is a problematic concept?  The authors do use it frequently. Some use it to define strictly Abrahamic religion, some trace its roots to Canaanite religion. Granted, the books I read are quite old (published in early 20th century). I assume this is an outdated way to refer to religious traditions in Middle East?"
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,keyilan,3,Sun Apr 26 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"Granted, the books I read are quite old (published in early 20th century)   Ahhh ok. That's the issue here. It all makes sense now.  The usage of the term ""Semitic"" has changed drastically since then. In the early 20th century it did have a much more general meaning, and then from the 1940s on it took on a more limited meaning as Jewish, except for in linguistics where it still has the broad meaning of a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. But the usage in linguistics is definitely not the generally used meaning.  Also, just to clarify, ""antisemitic"" has always had a more narrow focus on Jewish people for as long as it's been a word, going back to the late 1800s, even as ""semitic"" more generally had a wider meaning.  For a term for the religions in general, in a modern context it is simply not widely used. I think it's probably safe to call it ""problematic"" as you have, but more simply it's just not used that way any more. As for what the specific authors in question mean as the referent, I'd just go with the understanding you can get from the context, but know that it's not a common way to refer to the religions today.  Also, note that in some cases you might see the term ""Hamitic"" to refer to Islam or Arabs, based on the Biblical notion that Jews are descendants of Shem and Arabs of Ham. This is of course based on Biblical legend and not widely used in academic circles, or much of any circle these days. Still, something to be aware of as it might come up in your books."
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,keyilan,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:15:55 2015 UTC,"Also, note that in some cases you might see the term ""Hamitic"" to refer to Islam or Arabs   You're right, I encountered that term in one of those books just a few hours ago.   I guess Semitic religion is a defunct concept then? What term modern day scholars (anthropologists and historians alike) use to categorize the religions in Middle East, including the Mandaeism Lazar_Taxon below mentioned - or is it actually not that productive to lump various religions in that region in one umbrella concept?"
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,keyilan,2,Sun Apr 26 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's usually not productive. I don't have a good answer to /u/lazar_taxon's question because it's not something I can say I've ever encountered. If you need a catch-all, then I see nothing wrong with saying ""Middle Eastern""."
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,Lazar_Taxon,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Is there a book or article somewhere explaining how this field (religious studies? anthro of religion?) has progressed so far, e.g. what concepts are still useful, which scholars shouldn't be cited anymore, etc?  For laymen such as me this can get a bit confusing, especially when encountering defunct terms such as ""Semitic religion"". I bet this evolution of religion chart derives from such outdated concepts too."
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,masungura,2,Sun Apr 26 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, don't get too attached to anything more than 50 years old, and really it's better to go with newer sources and see what they in turn refer to. I don't know of a single book that outlines this, but it's not at all limited to anthropology or religious studies. Fields change, and a couple decades is certainly enough for the preferred terminology to change.  Probably the best place to look would be to figure out what undergraduate anthropology courses are using at some of the better universities and read that.   And yeah, that chart is pretty horrible. There was some discussion on it elsewhere (AskHistorians maybe) where it was torn apart, and rightfully so. Even just looking at the relationship between Islam and Christianity it's pretty bad. I'm getting grumpier the longer I look at it."
AskAnthropology,33wuvb,ONymeros,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, though – what terminology should we use for a religion like Mandaeism, which generally seems to fit into an Abrahamic paradigm  (revering Adam, Noah, and John the Baptist) but makes a specific point of rejecting Abraham?"
AskAnthropology,33t4o8,Lazar_Taxon,5,Sat Apr 25 10:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have any answers, but both my father and I tested higher for Denisovan ancestry than Neanderthal (2.9% vs 2.7% in me, 3.1% vs 2.7% in my dad).  To be honest, it's just another reason why anthropology, ancestry and genetics interest me so much."

AskAnthropology,33t4o8,NikkiJayne28,3,Sun Apr 26 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in and agree with the original commenters who brought up the Southwest Asian ancestry of  your family members. I would suspect that is where it is coming from.   Humans have rarely existed in discrete pockets of populations; admixture and gene flow between populations has been happening throughout all of our history. With that in mind, it follows that human variation usually displays a clinal pattern geographically. I would not be surprised to see some Denisovan bleed over in SW Asia, even if Denisovans themselves did not live there. SW Asian individuals surely mated with SE Asian individuals who may have carried Denisovan DNA.  Also, Dr. Hawks is probably correct about it being difficult to distinguish. Our ancestry DNA algorithms are usually quite accurate, but in the case of Neanderthals and Denisovans, we are dealing with so little information that it is possible we are getting false positive or false negative results for a variety of reasons. I would bet that as more Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes are sequenced, the more accurate and reliable these algorithms will become."
AskAnthropology,33t4o8,welearntolive,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in and agree with the original commenters who brought up the Southwest Asian ancestry of your family members. I would suspect that is where it is coming from.   Then why are comparable or even higher Denisovan levels reported by people of totally European descent, as in the examples I linked? That's really the main thrust of my question – my family members (who are of mostly European descent themselves) are just one example. Reich et al. found that even groups as far east as western Indonesia lacked Denisovan DNA, so it's not at all clear why we should expect it in Southwest Asia, which to my knowledge has never had a large infusion of genes from Melanesia or Oceania that skipped over the areas in-between."
AskAnthropology,33t4o8,welearntolive,1 point,Sun Apr 26 09:24:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously right now there are no answers, and these are great questions that need more data and research to be answered. So, after reading Dr. Hawks' blog posts (both the one you linked and, in particular, this other one), it seems there are two outstanding arguments currently. One, argued by Reich et al., whose data suggest there is no Denisovan DNA outside of SE Asia and Oceania. And two, Abi-Rached and Jakobbson et al. who each suggest there IS evidence for Denisovan DNA outside of those two regions, albeit at very small percentages. This means that either Reich et al.'s statistics or the depth of their data weren't powerful enough to detect small amounts of Denisovan DNA outside of SE Asia/Oceania, OR that the other researchers' data (plus all the individuals who find Denisovan DNA with the Geno 2.0 test despite not having SE Asian/Oceanian ancestry) is spurious. My personal opinion is that it might be a bit of both. I think it is likely that there is Denisovan DNA in individuals outside of Oceania and SE Asia, but I'm very skeptical of seeing percentages as high as 6% in individuals of ""100%"" European ancestry. I put quotes around the 100% because the ancestry-binning algorithms we use can be wrong; they are very dependent on the input parameters the programmer chooses. My point is that there is a lot of room for error and/or reduced statistical power here. There could be errors with our data (such as small sample sizes, particularly of Neanderthals and Denisovans). There could be errors with how we obtain that data (such as ascertainment bias, which Dr. Hawks describes). There could be errors in our analysis of the data (such as with the algorithms, as discussed). The research is all still in such an infantile state that one should proceed in interpreting personal DNA testing results with caution, particularly as it relates to Denisovan DNA.      tldr;  We just really don't know yet. My best hypothesis is that you do indeed have Denisovan DNA (likely from your SW Asian ancestry), but it may not actually be as high of a percentage as the test spits out.    So, basically, you have a fantastic question! Even top researchers in anthropological genetics can't agree on the answer. :)"

AskAnthropology,33rdmi,firedrops,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"I am not asking you to do my homework. I am having a hard time finding a place that explains it. I understand that codes are acquired through socialization and so people who are socialized a certain way acquire a different code. For example, a person who have been raised in a low-income setting may not have the code for modern art because they have not been socialized to see value in it. My problem was I don't know how Bourdieu fits into the equation as he is not in my textbook for taste and ""code"" and my professor does not email back until Monday."
AskAnthropology,33rdmi,firedrops,4,Sat Apr 25 11:32:08 2015 UTC,This is a subject he wrote about explicitly so he fits in as a major theorist on the subject. Take a look at this piece here (pdf warning). Trigg does a good job summarizing Bourdieu with regards to taste and conspicuous consumption.
AskAnthropology,33rdmi,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Sat Apr 25 11:47:30 2015 UTC,"Here's Bourdieu's concept of taste from Distinction:  ""In matters of taste, more than anywhere else, all determination is negation; and tastes are perhaps first and foremost distastes, disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance of the tastes of others ... which amounts to rejecting others as unnatural and therefore vicious. Aesthetic intolerance can be terribly violent. Aversion to different life-styles is perhaps one of the strongest barriers between the classes"" (p.56)"
AskAnthropology,33rdmi,firedrops,3,Sat Apr 25 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"As an example, my mother used to point out things as tacky which was a high insult. But it was a class distinction much more so than an actual aesthetics distinction.   Long fake fingernails with whole landscapes painted on them would be wondrous if placed into a context of exotic and cultured such as a national geographic photoshoot. You could have snooty conversations about folk art and world customs revealing to listeners just how worldly you are if they were a traditional Bedouin practice. But on the cashier at Walmart they are tacky. It is about context and learned boundaries not necessarily skill, quality, or aesthetics"

AskAnthropology,33rdmi,firedrops,2,Sun Apr 26 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"Ah but I think they are accusing them of being nouveau riche and therefore not yet having acquired the cultural capital to display wealth in a tasteful way. The decor is overdone and the food so old fashioned elite that it is out of fashion. In other contexts it could be camp but they are trying much to hard for that.   Nouveau riche is also tacky but in different ways.  Oh and in the article I linked to in my other comment Trigg argues that during the great depression the overt display of wealth became gauche because of the contrast of extreme poverty. A much more subtle code developed, which in the end is even harder to crack for newcomers."
AskAnthropology,33rdmi,masungura,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true. I think the context is slightly different in the UK though, in terms of the relationship between class and money, and dynamics between classes - there is always some antagonism between the working classes and the upper classes, both of the royal/titled type and of the merchants-who-became-fabulously-rich-in-the-18th-century type. And, in this case, the foreign type - there's plenty of antagonism about how much of London is owned by Qatar these days, or the Sultan of Brunei, or whomever. And on top of that, there's the tourist aspect. The Dorchester is not decorated just with rich British people, or upper-class people (who are two different groups, although they overlap) in mind, but also tourists who think that's what upper-class British people are like.   Partly I think it might be offense at the overt display of wealth, although I don't know how much, in the UK, that has to do with the depression, and how much is general antagonism. But partly you can also see that they're being criticised not for trying too hard to be more like the upper class, but for being upper class but doing stuff that's associated with the lower class. For example he mentions the ""goujonettes"" look exactly like fish fingers from a freezer bag at Iceland, which is a chain of super-budget stores selling basically nothing but frozen prepared meals.  Or, another example of the middle-class having a go at the upper-class, Monty Python's Upper Class Twit of the Year sketch. The problem isn't that they haven't the cultural capital to do things the way the proper rich upper class do them, it's that the way that the proper rich upper class does things is laughably alienated from reality, in terms of how ""common"" people (both working and middle classes) would perceive it.  Oh, or another example from pop culture, Common People by Pulp. Although that's not as explicitly connected to concepts of taste, more so the kind of dynamic between classes I was mentioning. I'm probably getting off topic with that anyway. But maybe that could be tied to the ""trickle-up"" effect mentioned in that article."
AskAnthropology,33rdmi,firedrops,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:07:17 2015 UTC,"Very true that there are likely big differences in class dynamics between the US and the UK. I think part of the issue is that this is someone pretending and putting on airs to an extent because they are not ""legitimately"" of that class category. Like Americans throwing a Downton Abbey party it would be almost a mockery and game of imitating the upper class if it didn't take itself so seriously. Yet, they also fail at their imitation (frozen fish fingers) because they don't really belong. And then like you say there is the added layer of the idea that the upper class is silly and out of touch anyway. The outdatedness of the dishes hints at that - one almost imagines a bunch of old ladies eating the foods of their childhood, waxing nostalgic for a time when the masses knew their place. The upper class are mocked for being so aloof and out of touch yet they are also mocked when they violate the norms for their class behaviors, dress, speech, foodways, etc. It is an interesting tension.   In the US, there is some of this. To be elected, presidential candidates need to display aspects of the common man to show they are not so far removed that they fail to understand the needs and concerns of the people. Most of our presidents have at least attended Ivy League schools and many were quite wealthy prior to being elected so they have to overcome that class bias. Certainly in the last presidential election Mitt Romney was mocked for being out of touch with ""real Americans"". GWBush was also very privileged (rich, Ivy League, and daddy was literally the most powerful man in the country) but he more successfully imitated the masses through staged photos of him chopping wood, rolling around with his dogs, and his accent coming through heavily in speeches.   I'd say that the dynamic in the US is first between urban and rural with rural people representing ""real"" America and the idea that the urban ""city boys"" couldn't make it in rural regions. Almost an Ibn Khaldun light. Then in urban settings you have the poor who are street smart and the super rich elite Park Avenue types (with plenty in between, of course, but that doesn't often make the narrative.) The Park Avenue elites are often depicted as entirely out of touch with reality and unable to do even basic tasks like washing dishes. They are often the butt of jokes especially now that social media provides a lens onto their complaints. For example, articles like this making fun of them for not being able to deal with hangovers and paying for IV drips. Or the blog Stuff Rich People Love A popular movie example might be Trading Places"

This is a rock of unspecified shape and size, transported a significant distance from its origin by a glacier or iceberg and deposited by melting of the ice.

AskAnthropology,33rlsr,MiyegomboBayartsogt,3,Sat Apr 25 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"A couple people have said that it is a glacial erratic and as far as the actual rock goes, it probably is (but northern parts of Michigan do have igneous or metamorphic bedrock, which this rock comes from). But erratics are just rocks carried by glaciers and they can take all sorts of shapes, and they can certainly be worked into tools. And this rock likely sat in a stream of some sort for a time (could be a river within a glacier, or just any river. It is water-worn).   I have seen baguette-shaped rocks like this that were used as pestles at village sites. So this could be a tool, in that it is plausible. But I don't think it is. If this were a tool it would be most likely be used for grinding, maybe with some hammering or pecking mixed in. It is signs of the pecking all over it (but lots of natural things can cause that). But is it super super smooth anywhere? I'm talking smooth like a polished marble or granite countertop. Any grinding stone I've seen is incredibly smooth, much more so than could happen naturally. I can't really tell that from the photos alone, but there do appear to be lots of areas that really don't look smooth.  Context is the other thing. A large grinding stone would almost certainly only be found on a village site. Do your mom or people in the neighbourhood ever find native pottery or stone tools? If no other sings of a village are found nearby, then this is just a rock. If it is found among a lot of obvious signs of Precolumbian human activity, then it is probably a tool."

Ethnic groups on the Balkan are very intertwined and don't follow national borders very well. Ethnic identity is defined by language and religion. Albanians have a somewhat special status becuase their language does not belong to the slavic languages(Like Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Slovenian, Macedonian, Bulgarian) and they don't have their own religion(Greek orthodox).   For this reason Albanians identify themselves strongly with their language and form Albanian exclaves outside of Albania and Kosovo(a de facto Albanian state with strong ethnic minorities). There are Albanian settlements throughout the southern half of the Balkan peninsula and Italy. Most often those people identify strongly with Albanian culture, despite living outside of Albania for generations, or even centuries(the Arbëresh in Italy live there since over 500years for example).  You have to keep mind that your question is loaded. Because for many reasons the territorial integrity of certain countries in the region is shaky, most notably Serbia's since the declaration of independence of Kosovo in 2008.

Most of the images you've probably seen are probably people wearing traditional cultural dress for tourism/entertainment purposes.

People dress appropriately for their climate and vocation everywhere in the world, except when we don culturally specific garb or uniforms. If you take a boat deep into the Amazon, the people you meet there will be wearing t-shirts and shorts. Aboriginal Australians love wearing name-brand sneakers just as much as the residents of Los Angeles.

AskAnthropology,33iehg,SeventhCorridor,14,Wed Apr 22 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"I think marriage is a classic ""family resemblance"" category. All humans have a biological tendency to form social bonds with their sex partners; all humans have a psychological tendency to wrap their biological tendencies in cultural meanings; therefore, all human societies tend to have cultural meanings attached to the social relationship of two people having sex. And so whenever anthropologists observe something like that, they call it marriage. But when you actually break it down, all the different forms of marriage in different societies have very little in common. Certainly some very basic features of Western marriage aren't at all universal: (theoretical) irreversibility, exclusivity, cohabitation, a ceremony, shared responsibility for childrearing, and so on. Sure, marriage in many other societies has some or all of those features, but for every one of them there's also plenty of exceptions. Musuo ""walking marriages"" can be made and broken in a night. More societies are polygynous, polyandrous, or polygamous than monogamous. In Papua New Guinea men live in the men's house, married or not. Hadza couples start calling each other ""husband"" and ""wife"" after they've had sex a few times, with no fanfare. In many cultures it is a woman's brother, not her husband, that acts as a parent to her children.  In other words, marriage is only ""universal"" because we find something to call marriage in every society. But if you look more closely, marriage as a consistent and well-defined cross-cultural phenomenon doesn't exist at all."

No need to look to exotic non-western culture to see such a thing. About a third of all couples in Quebec live that way and would be defined as ""mariage"" by your definition even as the traditional western mariage is readily available to them. They dont use the same terminology for these two kinds of ""mariage"" but there is an existing tendency to uniformize what it's called and how it's recognized by the Law.  So, even the definition of mariage, or ils very existence if you choose a rigide definition, in the western world is not set in stone."

AskAnthropology,33fk1e,brigantus,3,Wed Apr 22 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"Surveying in archaeology can mean any number of things. It can be driving around looking for interesting things and asking locals if they know of any old ruins – not very scientific, but the vast majority of sites were discovered by people doing that in days gone by. More systematic pedestrian survey is done by dividing a landscape up into units and having a team walk across them in transects looking for features and artefacts. To survey larger areas more quickly there's aerial photography. Traditionally that meant taking photographs from planes and looking for visible remains or crop marks. Increasingly nowadays people are using drones, which can be outfitted with all sorts of high tech instruments. LIDAR is one of them: it uses the same principle as radar, only with a laser instead of radiowaves, and is used to create very high resolution 3D models of the ground surface. Crucially it penetrates vegetation, so you can spot features that are otherwise hidden under forest canopies. And at the other end of the spectrum entirely, a lot of initial survey work these days is complete desk-based, using satellite imagery, historic maps and records, and predictive models.  Once sites have been located there's a whole other set of surveying and remote sensing techniques for mapping their internal layout. Again, you can use drones or kites to try and spot earthworks, crop marks and map out the topography around the site. But our principle means of getting a sense of what's beneath the ground is geophysical survey, a set of techniques for probing for differences in soil composition. It's relatively quick and cheap and produces a rough ""map"" of what's underground, so it's often used as a preliminary assessment and used to place excavation trenches.  Beginning an excavation in itself isn't terribly exciting. You locate your trench using surveyors' tools – usually GPS and a total station these days – but sometimes you might have to break out the compass and tapes. Then you bang some nails or pegs in the corners, join them with string, and start shovelling soil out. The size of the trench can vary a lot depending on your reason for excavating. When you're exploring a site initially, or if you want to sample lots of units over a wide area, you might start with 1x1 m test pits that one person can excavate in. On urban sites that have very deep deposits, you'll often dig a narrow slot trench to concentrate on the vertical stratigraphy. Most commonly, when a project's in full swing, a large area will be opened where a team can work side by side – how large depending entirely on the nature and size of the site, and of course your budget.  As for which excavation system, you'd use a Wheeler box grid if you were in the 1930s... but nowadays open area excavation is the norm. That is, you open a single contiguous area and dig it stratigraphically: one deposit at a time. The sections on the edges of the trench are still handy, but as long as the site is dug stratigraphically and recorded properly, you're no longer relying on them to reconstruct the sequence of deposits, so you don't need baulks in the middle of the trench (strictly speaking, at least – on a large excavation you might still leave a baulk or two in to help keep a handle on the stratigraphy and for practical reasons of access.)"

Using fire to turn earth into metal. So people were secretive in techniques. Early smelting would have predated writing. So it wouldn't have been common knowledge or written about untill much later.  Lead and tin smelting predate copper smelting. Cast lead beads were found at Çatal Höyük site in Anatolia (Turkey). As I'm sure you know lead has a much lower melting point. It was possible this was discovered by accident since you could melt lead with wood fire.  The earliest current evidence of copper smelting, dating from between 5500 BC and 5000 BC, has been found in Pločnik and Belovode, Serbia. To achieve temperature need a pottery kilns would of likely been first forges. If by accident or experimentation it is difficult to tell. However, we do know experimentation was common when firing pottery. Remember it would be possible to hammer native copper or copper with few impurities.  The first copper/arsenic bronzes date from 4200 BC from Asia Minor. Arsenic is common impurity in copper ore so difficulty to tell if it was selected for in ore or added. It's not really know why copper and tin were mixed. Could be ores with varying amounts of copper and tin mixed during smelting or again experimentation. Tin based bronze would have been developed by 3200 BC and common by about 2000 BC.  There is some instances of iron working and smelting as far backs as 1200 BC in Western Africa, this is debated. Early iron wasn't melted it was bloomed, heated blow it's melting point. It would expand and be hammered. earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan and dates to 930 BC (C14 dating)."

He also talked about the importance of ritual/religion: a process, which must be followed exactly as it was sacred, was the thing that gave consistency. It acted as a sort of physical equation that could help people without measuring instruments to get (for example) the fire to exactly the right temperature every time, which was vital for creating strong tools, weapons, armour etc. His point was illustrated with the Shinto rituals around creating a Katana."

AskAnthropology,33apdx,Truegold43,4,Tue Apr 21 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't really pick a concentration. A concentration picked me. You start out with general interests but maybe not much idea about what those really are, and then you find yourself becoming interested in some subset of that as your education develops. If you're an undergrad, and an undeclared one at that, then you probably don't actually know enough about the ins and outs of the field to know what you're really interested in. That's not me taking a shot at you; I think it's just a fact and it was certainly my experience at that point.  My advice is this: Just pick one that looks like it might be interesting, because in the end it doesn't matter at all. If you end up getting a graduate degree in the field then that's when you're going to pick the first of your actual specialties, and whatever you did as an undergrad won't really have much affect on it. And if you don't go into anthropology for grad school, then your concentration as an undergrad really doesn't matter.  When I was an undergrad I had literally not yet discovered the existence of the stuff that became my focus for my masters degree, and my focus for the PhD was only tangentially based on what I did for my masters. Really only as my PhD topic solidified did I start to have a sense of where I'd be going more than one step down the line, but then in 10 years maybe I totally shift my focus. It's been known to happen.  If you have a few different things that you might want to make your concentration, just make a list of pros and cons of each and then whichever turns out to be better in terms of that, just go with it and be okay leaving the others behind. You can always get back to them later in your career.  Disclaimer: I'm not strictly speaking an anthropologist (however you want to determine that), but I play one on tv. Unless you're at one of the bigger universities linguistics was typically under the Anthropology department (now more often the foreign languages department, as much as that makes me shudder). There's a huge amount of crossover of course, and a lot of what I end up doing in the field is more along the lines of cultural anthropology than it is linguistics. You end up engaging a lot with ethnobotanists, ethnomusicologists, and doing things like documenting festivals and dances and dress, and frankly I feel that any linguist doing documentation of minority languages really ought to have something of a solid background in anthropology. So, yeah, not actually a real anthropologist, but I also think my answer is pretty widely applicable."

Availability of resources and pressures on the survivability of offspring shape social groups, access to mates, and parenting strategies. The richness and pervasive influence of human culture makes it difficult (and ethically problematic) to extrapolate any single set of biological ""rules"" guiding human reproduction. That being said, many fossil hominins and, to a lesser extent,  modern humans show sexual dimorphism that suggests that polygyny has been fairly common throughout our evolutionary past. However, our attitudes are shaped by cultural environment and personal psychology, and anyone trying to moralize a single ""natural"" or inherent human reproductive strategy is probably mistaken."

Even non-sexually transmitted diseases often can spread via sex (airborne, saliva contact, ect ect), so people who were monogamous were more likely to survive these diseases.   It logically follows that those monogamous people would have seen those who were poly were afflicted while those with monogamous partners were not. Giving strong social reasons to encourage monogamous relationships.  Whether or not this remains a strong reason to stay monogamous in today's society is another discussion."
AskAnthropology,338y10,Terkala,2,Mon Apr 20 19:27:49 2015 UTC,I heard of an idea that suggets that urban development and sawn of civilization caused people to move towards more monogamous relationships since it os better to divide families and group people and with inheretence and teachong of trades.

Gibbons are approximately the same size and mate for life. a Male gorilla is twice the size of a female and the dominant male has many mates (polygamous). Human males are just slightly bigger than females so you'd expect us to be mostly monogamous - which is pretty much what you find in reality."

AskAnthropology,337lcf,caspito,5,Mon Apr 20 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"In Texas and across much of the Plains, Native Americans during the Archaic period made extensive use of burned rock ovens.  A pit was dug into the ground, lined with slabs of rock, and a fire was lit in the pit.  Then once the fire died down, packets of food wrapped in green leaves  were placed on top of the coals.  The rocks were needed because they could retain heat longer than the coals alone.  The oven was then covered with soil and/or more rocks and allowed to sit that way for up to 48 hours.  This made bulb foods such as camas edible to the natives.  Camas requires extensive cooking to process its inulin into more digestible carbohydrates.  After multiple heating and cooling events, the rock slabs break down into smaller fragments and are discarded and replaced with new rocks.  Over time, these discarding and replacement events create burned rock middens, which is one of the most common types of prehistoric sites found in central Texas.  The Richard Beene site is an example of one site where such behavior took place.  Keep in mind though that this sort of behavior was done primarily for cooking, and sometimes it was used to heat-chert chert to make it more flakeable.  It was not used to smelt metal, which never occurred prehistorically (as far as I know) in North America."

They therefore encouraged and amplified Flood stories where they found them, arguing that these were the biblical flood, and hence creating commonality of history with the aboriginal groups.  More animistic (for example) oral histories would be discouraged or banned, and certainly not written down by the churchmen.    In this way, Flood stories which were prevalent everywhere are given a magnified importance relative to their indigenous importance and were selected for preservation to the present vs other equally important stories.
