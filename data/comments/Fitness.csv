Fitness,3e3ccb,ImReallyBoard,12,Tue Jul 21 17:15:38 2015 UTC,Those squats are high bar. This video will show you bar placement for low bar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tyOLvArw0 You are not breaking parallel on your squats. You are supposed to keep the weight on your heels but you are lifting your heels up and reliying on your toes. I cannot see if your legs are caving in I am sorry. But if they are that is also a problem. Good luck.
Fitness,3e3ccb,okarin115,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like when I go lower I end up relying more on my toes, do you have any idea why that would be?"
Fitness,3e3ccb,okarin115,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"Lower the weight. Set the weight to a point where you aren't relying on your toes anymore and breaking parallel. Form is important, when you master that you will get the weight and without injuries. Hope it helped.."
Fitness,3e3ccb,safe_space_invader,5,Tue Jul 21 18:10:16 2015 UTC,low bar might not be the solution. Leaning forward might be caused by lack of flexibility (especially in the ankles) and long femurs which forces you to lean forward in order to keep the weight over the middle of the foot. Also your knees are slightly caving in which might be caused by weak adductors
Fitness,3e3ccb,okarin115,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:02 2015 UTC,Yea I didn't mean low bar is solution I just said it's a low bar because op said at the start of the post quote:'I have no idea if these are high bar or low bar'.
Fitness,3e3ccb,Exci_,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks for pointing that out, I didn't really know what the difference was and I know people like to know if they are high or low bar in form check videos."
Fitness,3e3ccb,BronsonBuster,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:32 2015 UTC,Could be ankle mobility or simply not keeping in mind to maintain the bar over your midfoot.
Fitness,3e3ccb,BronsonBuster,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Core and flexors play a big role in keeping you upright and stable.  I used to cave forward and fixed it by rolling my flexors, couch stretches every squat day, and a lot of ball crunches."
Fitness,3e3ccb,SSFLEG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""flexors""?"
Fitness,3e3ccb,Exci_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"Your hip flexors, they're the muscles at the top of each leg near the middle front and they control the bending of your hips as you squat.  They can get pretty weak especially if you sit a lot.  A good way to test this is to do some ball crunches, if you're having trouble staying stable on the ball, your flexors are probably weak."
Fitness,3e3ccb,safe_space_invader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"Try squatting with a raised heel. Easiest way to do this is to put 2.5s or 5s on the ground where you place your heels. This will help you avoid fixing your ankle flexibility, which you should fix outside of squats, and allow you to reach full depth without leaning forward into your toes."
Fitness,3e3ccb,orangeisstupid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"It's fairly evident that in your conventional deadlift the bar is way too far forward when you setup. Bring it back a couple inches. Similar issue with your squat, you're going on your toes. You need to bring the center of mass back."
Fitness,3e3ccb,eknoteri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think I put the bar forward on deadlifts because I'm a wuss and worried about banging up the fronts of my shins, but I'll definitely scoot it back a bit next time I'm doing them."
Fitness,3e3ccb,TannSecura,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"wear pants or knee high socks on deadlift days or just accept that your shins might bleed little bit, I don't feel it anymore when pulling heavy"
Fitness,3e3ccb,thecloudkicker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"Start light and get used to it. The bar should be <1"" from your shins all the way up.  Additionally, your back, while not rounded, is close to it. Focus on ""pinching"" your shoulder blades. Your upper back/shoulders are rounded, so focus on correcting that.  You are too leg-heavy at the start of the dl, and too back-heavy near the top. You need to balance it a bit. Look up some professional videos, as I can't recommend an exact ratio.  As for your pain, it is something I have experience 2 times badly. Thinking all was well with my 5 reps at 425 I jumped up to 455. My back hurt under heavy load for months.  I scaled back on deadlifts and squats (deadlifts hovering around 365-395 with perfect form) for a few months, and after ~6 months my pain was gone and I was repping out 455. The key here is patience. You gave your back an ouchy, and it takes a lot of time for that to get better. You can see a physio, get ultrasound, massage, etc. I never did that, just kept it lighter for a while and focused on perfect form, not max effort.  I suggest you do the same."
Fitness,3e3ccb,thecloudkicker,0,Tue Jul 21 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice man. When you say my shoulders are rounded, do you mean during the lift or in general, even when I'm relaxed?"

Fitness,3e3ccb,thecloudkicker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:02 2015 UTC,This was the main thing I noticed as well.  OP is really getting the weight on the front of the foot instead of driving through the heals.  Knees are getting a little too far forward because of that.  Work on flexibility and try getting your shins closer to vertical at the bottom of your squat

Fitness,3e3a41,Akintunde,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:49 2015 UTC,Is Strong lift a good program if Im trying to get aesthetically better looking or is it just for strength and I should add accessory lifts to compliment my main to hit other muscles?
Fitness,3e3a41,JohnnyChuttz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"It's a good base in any case. As a beginner, you could do the older version with dips and chin ups for a while before switching to something that is not focused in aesthetics."
Fitness,3e3a41,AndrewCrimzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"Isolation exercises are no better than compounds at building muscle, really.  You may speed the process up a bit, but it's only going to be a bit.  My main contention with Strong Lifts is the low amount of upper body work vs leg work.  Your smaller muscles recover faster, and as such should probably be worked more often.  That being said, Stronglifts is a fine, short term, beginners program.  You learn the exercises.  That's the entire point of it.  You need a base of strength, and SL will give that to you.  You could look into Greyskull LP or Starting Strength as well.  GSLP is a fine program and is a little less squat-centric.  The Power Cleans from SS are a better overall exercise than rows, assuming you can perform them correctly."

Fitness,3e3a41,ipkpplirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"My program is based on block periodization. I believe all beginners-advanced lifters should spend a majority of the year trying to fill out their ideal weight class, as increasing muscle cross sectional area is the easiest way to increase strength potential. Another benefit of more bodybuilder style training is reduced injury risk.  I have 4 main training days and two additional days where I do back work.   My first lift of the day is Sq/B/Dl/OHP. I work up to a top set of 6-8 reps @8RPE, drop 2 reps from my main set and perform 1 or more backdown sets.   My second lift is a variation of the opposing lift (for example OHP on bench day). These are performed in the 8-10 range, same protocol as above.  Third lift is a supplementary lift for the first movement that is less intense. For example DB bench on bench day. 12-15 reps, same protocol as above.  Any lifts after this are general accessories.   You can progress by adding weight each week, using a wave protocol (going from 8-7-6 then repeat trying to beat your previous lift for each rep range), or use the same weight but add reps (start at 6 and try and lift the same weight for 7 the next week, then 8)."

They are at best an accessory lift and should be treated as such. That means - drop them if you feel like they take away more than they give. Or replace them. Dumbbell, cable, Kroc, machine, t-bar, whatever. Find a variant you are comfortable with and row row row fight the power."

Maybe you are not being 100% honest or maybe you are using an incorrect entry on myfitnesspal, i've seen entries for peanut butter at ~100kcal for a tablespoon, now that seems stupid but to someone just starting out who has no idea about calories per portion it's an issue.   Just the combination of consistent meals (i pretty much eat the same things every week, then if progress slows i eat less of it), taking my average weekly weight and slowly increasing the amount of stuff i do at the gym be it cardio or adding volume works perfectly.

You'd probably be alright doing sets of 5 and below with 90ish% of your clean but good luck having the energy to do 5 front squats after a heavy clean, not to mention multiple sets. Also the fact that a gym that doesn't have a squat rack will most likely not have bumpers so dropping weights to conserve energy won't be an option... Last (but not least!) learning good clean technique with anything near heavy enough to front squat effectively will take a ton of time and will probably require a coach.

Your weight loss may have stopped because your diet is not allowing you to burn more calories than you are eating. My advice: if you are not, start tracking calories on myfitnesspal, set your goals for a pound a week, with sedentary lifestyle and DO NOT eat back any burned calories. Just hit your number.  As for cardio at home or at the gym — cardio is cardio. Find something you like doing and keep doing it. Use diet to lose weight, cardio to be healthier."
Fitness,3e2j1x,Arronax147,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how have you plateau'd with calorie counting and watching what you eat? You should recalculate your TDEE, since you lost 10lbs. Weight/fat loss is 80% diet, 20% exercise.  Home weight loss programs do work, although they may not yield as much/nice results as lifting weights in the gym. You could just find a beginner program and lift, followed by a low intensity cardio session to burn those extra calories."
Fitness,3e2j1x,redjoe1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe plateau'd wasn't the right wording for it. I'm using the MyFitnessPal app which at least seems to recalculate calories as I enter new weights in. I guess a better explanation would be that the lower calories are harder to hit on a daily basis as I don't have a very structured day. I spend a lot of my days driving between clients and sitting in server rooms. I'm usually eating on the run, I steer clear of fast foods, mostly because I don't like them. I'm not always having the healthiest things for meals either though.  That's why I'm looking to include exercise into my days, I'm hoping by burning extra calories I'm making up for some of the less healthy items I may end up eating. And in the process get into a healthier fitness level state."

You should try to cook your meals on Sunday as recommended by this subreddit, so you have prepped meals for the week, portable and perfect for on-the-go eats. You could also count macros, with an IIFYM diet and eat whatever you want and still be healthy.  You should try and allocate a bit of time every week for the gym. Start small, maybe 2-3 days, and pick out a full-body program to build a bit of muscle and burn some fat. Or just do a bodyweight routine, works just as well too!"

When you lift the barbell try to pull your elbows and hands together like you are doing when performing flies (even though you can't, obviously)   Mayybe lower the barbell a bit lower than you do (if you lower it at nipple level then try lower and see how it feels, then keep going lower or higher until you find a sweet spot,try that with light weight so you won't kill yourself)  Also take a look at these 2 which helped me feel the bench press on my chest immensely!  This is about bringing the arms together so you hit the chest more than your triceps  http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/benching-with-the-pecs.html/  And this is about the flaring elbow argument.

Do something like SS or 531 for bench. If you do dips, lower your reps here as well, say 5-8 reps. Alternate with dumbbells. Same thing, mainly lower rep ranges. Make sure you learn good form.  EDIT: Remember that the pecs are actually quite small muscles. Don't overtrain them when you lower your rep ranges. And be wary of neck pain - a likely sign of stength imbalance. Switch to dumbbells for a while to correct."

Fitness,3e0zc7,hxcjuggernaut,2,Tue Jul 21 10:01:41 2015 UTC,Hit chest 3x a week and only do flat and incline benches. Retract your scapula and PAUSE EVERY REP. Do this and get stronger and those two exercises.
Fitness,3e0zc7,Anonymischief,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"Idk why everyone in this subreddit has be a condescending asshole... Honestly man if you're strength is going up but not your size you're probably not eating enough. Have you calculated your TDEE and ate above that? It's impossible (unless you're a newbie, which you are not) to gain muscle AND lose fat. You can gain strength but not size. Whatever you're doing, may it be 5x5 or 3x20, you should see more size especially after 2 years. If you have any questions feel free to ask but I bet it's just the food."
Fitness,3e0zc7,hxcjuggernaut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"As a trainer, people often come to me with this problem.  In general, you should increase your volume, however don't drop below 60% of your 1RM.  I would suggest staying around 70%.  Make sure to monitor your progress and add reps and sets in each workout to find your level of maximum recoverable volume.   It's worth mentioning Just because I've had clients approach me with this concern and on observing their chest work, they were stopping themselves well short of full range of motion (not touching the bar to their chest/ half chest flys).  Try to achieve full range of motion and maintain a consistent bar speed to monitor progress accurately.    Also- get on the incline bench as your primary movement -greater range of motion plus everyone likes a bigger clavicular pectoralis (upper chest)"
Fitness,3e0zc7,victheion,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"How long have you been lifting? It doesn't happen overnight you know. Make sure you are eating enough. My chest is a big weakness in my own physique since I'm long armed and tend to be an arm bencher, but lately I've seen good results in doing spoto presses and zero leg drive pressing. My pecs have noticable grown since I've started doing these a month ago.   Basically, find a movement that makes you ""feel it in your pecs,"" and hammer the shit out of it. Generally, doing a normal bench, I don't get much of a pec pump at all, but when doing zero leg drive or spoto, i get a much better pec pump.   Lots of bro-science here, but it's worked for me."
Fitness,3e0zc7,Stinkynugs,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:49 2015 UTC,I recommend super sets! I would show you my chest but idk how to upload it into Reddit on a comment but I went from having flappy as tits to almost having them cut and I'm about 246 pounds.

Fitness,3e0zc7,TatdGreaser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I try to workout a group of muscle a day .. like one day I spend 2hrs on chest the next day 2hrs on back then following the next day working out biceps for 1hr and 30 mins. Just one muscle at a time or sections. Just keep it up and go hard!!"
Fitness,3e0zc7,Neuromancer311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:31:49 2015 UTC,"It might be a form issue, are you benching and doing your presses with flared out elbows? If so try tucking in your elbows in and really focus of engaging your pecs and less shoulders."
Fitness,3e0zc7,el_flaco1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:07 2015 UTC,Eat more?
Fitness,3e0zc7,Lou__Tennant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:19:06 2015 UTC,Do you think your presses may be activating your triceps a bit too much?
Fitness,3e0zc7,Tog_the_destroyer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:05 2015 UTC,"When you are pressing, what's bringing you to failure first? Your chest, or your triceps? I had the same problem. I started to see results after I swapped my workout around, to pre-exhaust the chest.  This mean't isolation exercises like flyes come first, then move on to the compound movements like press. By doing this, my I was working to failure of the chest, rather than triceps. You can also superset these exercises if you want to go harder.  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pre-exhaust-training-order-your-movements-for-maximum-growth.html"
Fitness,3e0zc7,adpowah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of good advice in here. I'd like to add, are you doing chest twice a week?"
Fitness,3e0zc7,MrBokbagok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:33:39 2015 UTC,I was impressed when I saw your flat bench numbers - you are ~20lbs heavier than me but you bench 100lbs more than me. Then I saw the pics....where is your chest!!??! It's crazy! Perhaps your arms and shoulders are taking over?
Fitness,3e0zc7,Armandiosis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:28 2015 UTC,It might be my shoulders and triceps. My triceps are huge...

Fitness,3e0zc7,aaronis1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting because your bench is your strongest lift in my opinion. From side on, your chest does look slightly small in comparison to your arms, but nothing particularly disproportionate. I don't really have much advice for you unfortunately since my bench is abysmal. How often do you bench? Maybe increasing the frequency could get some growth."
Fitness,3e0zc7,oramidriven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:12 2015 UTC,Are you isolating the muscle? Are you sure that you're not compensating anywhere else? I had an arm injury and I was doing exercises at PT but someone found out I was compensating with my upper traps to do it all. Removed that and my strength plummeted. Make sure you're not using other muscles to move that weight
Fitness,3e0zc7,ibtar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:06 2015 UTC,Probably incorporating paused benching and spoto pressing will allow you to activate the chest more.
Fitness,3e0zc7,CoverDrive1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"the advice in this thread is all over the fucking place. low weight, high volume; low volume, high weight; higher frequency lower volume.  does anybody actually know anything?"
Fitness,3e0zc7,ibtar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:36 2015 UTC,you need higher rep ranges bruh
Fitness,3e0zc7,oramidriven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Compound lifts can be done by emphasizing different muscles. It may not be noticeable when you're at it, but you could try backing off on the lifts that may hit other muscles that you think look too big in comparison. I for instance don't do dips because I feel it too much in my triceps. Try your flies one arm at a time and do the full range of motion. Shit is brutal."
Fitness,3e0zc7,KushDingies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:06 2015 UTC,You haven't learned how to get your body to start growing any serious mass anywhere.  I'd definitely increase the volume and intensity on everything. If you push it hard enough it will grow.
Fitness,3e0zc7,riggyslim,-4,Tue Jul 21 06:09:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly the rest of you doesn't look huge either. Are you eating enough? You need to stuff your face. If that's two years progress hten you seriously need to reconsider your programme, how much you're eating etc"
