HomestarRunner,3d9qky,mystman12,9,Tue Jul 14 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"I wish it weren't so, but these days, I can't imagine a lot of new users coming to homestarrunner.egg for the first time. I'm sure the people who already know about the site will find a way to change their browser settings (Firefox makes you aware that an element was blocked)."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Thunderbeak,9,Tue Jul 14 17:03:23 2015 UTC,homestarrunner.egg   it's dot com.
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,ReactsWithWords,6,Tue Jul 14 17:48:31 2015 UTC,welcome to my wed site!
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Gamerguywon,2,Wed Jul 15 00:33:42 2015 UTC,This is a website.
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,x_minus_one,5,Tue Jul 21 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"It was bound to happen, tbh... The Flash Player just isn't suitable or secure for much of anything these days. Flash the program, on the other hand, has much more of a sustainable life ahead of it."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,TheTedH,3,Tue Jul 14 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that the app Flash has a longer lifespan. It's solid at what it does, and you can convert to MOV for modern HTML5 players."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,AlexanderDavidBand,2,Tue Jul 14 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"It's an adequate tool, but there's a lot that needs to be fixed still. The onboard video export, for example, is horrendous. I just use Swivel to export any of my animations."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,TheTedH,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I hope homestarrunner.com is kept up. It's absolutely not the same to watch the videos on youtube, no easter eggs!! And it's just not as immersive of an experience... although that could be said for most of the web these days."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,meilonade,3,Thu Jul 16 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"I just watched a couple HR stuffs on Firefox, no problem. I think this is a storm in a cup of water."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Thohi,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but bigger things are coming. NPAPI support is being depreciated across the board. Chrome has it disabled by default on Windows and Mac, and completely removed on Linux. Firefox has similar plans in mind, but without much in the way of a replacement."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Hellmark,3,Tue Jul 14 18:53:20 2015 UTC,Wasn't there some work a while back on a tool from Adobe for converting Flash to HTML5 or something?
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Hellmark,3,Tue Jul 14 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"I fix the blame squarely on Apple for killing the popularity of HSR.  Shunning Flash on the iPhone/iPad left a huge hole in the prime target audience of the site.  Further, I believe I can prove - through unsubstantiated inference and coincidental evidence - that Steve Jobs himself saw Ye Olde Brothers Chaps as a threat to Pixar, and wanted to undermine their popularity by creating devices that couldn't view HomeStarRunner.com.  That man was a monster."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,CanadianWalrus,2,Sat Jul 18 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"It will be blocked, by default."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Theophagist,2,Wed Jul 15 14:38:10 2015 UTC,It means get Chrome.
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,captaintaco2345,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"It's unblockable, and the global block goes away if you update the Flash player."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,kianworld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"If all web browsers decide to do the same thing, is there any hope for Homestar Runner? I sure hope Chrome doesn't decide to do the same!"
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,sp3dhands,3,Tue Jul 14 16:35:09 2015 UTC,Block in this context likely means a box that asks you if you want to load flash items on the page before it loads them.
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Kyoraki,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's how it works. Pretty fucking annoying to be honest; it's shocking just how many websites still have Flash containers floating around."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Hellmark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, that's a bit of a relief. I thought it meant Flash was totally disabled on Firefox."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,Hellmark,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:22 2015 UTC,"No, but time is coming. Right now Flash, Java, and a few other plugins use something called NPAPI for working with the browser. It is a 20 year old API that is really outdated. IE dropped support for it years ago. Chrome has killed support for it on Linux, and disabled by default it for Mac and Windows with plans to kill it there. Mozilla has depreciated support for it in Firefox, and eventually are going to kill it entirely. Google has a replacement called Pepper, and it has been working on a version of Flash using Pepper for years (They first unveiled in in 2010 on Windows, and switched to it for Mac and Linux in 2012). IE has an ActiveX version, but it really isn't any more secure than the NPAPI version. All other browsers really don't have anything else in the pipeline."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,totallytman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"Chrome has their own version of Flash, and they just roll out updates whenever, where as Firefox is dependent on Adobe to release the update first. This was a case where Adobe was dragging ass about releasing an update to a critical flaw and Mozilla didn't want to wait any longer."
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,atglobe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:50 2015 UTC,This is why I use Chrome!
HomestarRunner,3d9qky,ReactsWithWords,-3,Tue Jul 14 23:56:35 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm a chrome user now.
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,mrcontesty,10,Tue Jul 14 07:02:58 2015 UTC,"True, unforced abstract humor.  That was awesome but I'm excited for more Dooble."
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,Theophagist,6,Tue Jul 14 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"You're my favorite, Jordi."
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,CaptainEightBall,4,Wed Jul 15 17:22:03 2015 UTC,Steve's Pie was my favorite.
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,accidentallybrill,5,Thu Jul 16 04:21:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely felt like the best episode so far. I feel like if any of these shorts seems like it belongs on a Telebision screen in the H*R universe, then it's a good one in my book."
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,MEGATRUCK,5,Wed Jul 15 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"The Beefmongers' is clearly the backside of Bub's ConcessI mean Blellam's Disco.  I wonder if the patch of Pish Posh is related to The Stick, or Carrot and Kazoo Hill."
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,accidentallybrill,6,Thu Jul 16 04:20:41 2015 UTC,Can I just say how deeply I enjoy Matt Chapman's voice acting?
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,holdmusic,3,Tue Jul 14 18:07:44 2015 UTC,I liked this!  yay!
HomestarRunner,3d86jp,ride365,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Oh man. The brothers are about my age, and this cartoon perfectly captures every stupid insipidly twee filmstrip we were forced to endure in elementary school. Brilliant."
HomestarRunner,3d206a,Emasterr,3,Sun Jul 12 21:50:08 2015 UTC,Can't wait until Halloween when they sell the orange and black flavors
HomestarRunner,3d206a,MEGATRUCK,3,Sun Jul 12 22:23:53 2015 UTC,These are the best marshmallows and they are vegan!
HomestarRunner,3d206a,cowmix,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:06 2015 UTC,I imagine Marshy is flipping his fluff upon seeing this.
HomestarRunner,3d206a,OldSchoolVinny,2,Sun Jul 12 22:31:48 2015 UTC,Looks a bit like Mr. Shmallow in his younger years.
HomestarRunner,3d206a,Catjaz63,4,Sun Jul 12 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"""Look Lively!"""
HomestarRunner,3d206a,GameAndWatcher,2,Wed Jul 15 23:58:59 2015 UTC,But are they hand puffed in the factory in Neuconsin?
