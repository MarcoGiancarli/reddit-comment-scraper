transgendercirclejerk,3dhv3q,claimstoknowpeople,13,Thu Jul 16 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure which level you're talking about so I will explain this to the point of completely killing all humor that has ever existed.   Comedy, particularly sarcasm and irony, often involves making one claim or impression to instead communicate the exact opposite. When this incongruity is understood by a listener at the right time it produces a pleasant, amused response. The listener may even emit laughter which is a social signal that they perceived the incongruity and the joke teller will know their unstated message was understood.   Women in our society are perceived by some men to be so dumb that these men are unable to perceive this kind of humor when a woman performs it. Instead of being amused by the speaker's ability to construct the incongruity, a man might think the woman is simply foolish and attempt to explain to her that her statement or implication is not, in fact, true -- when this was the exact thing her sarcasm was intended to relate.  It may be difficult to follow this twitter conversation if you're unfamiliar with the service. The first post is by the woman in the middle, who points out the above situation in a sarcastic way:   A main reason women aren't funny is that they are seriously misinformed. If one of them makes a joke point out its factual inaccuracies ASAP   The statement is so over the top we know not to believe it at face value -  women aren't seriously misinformed, and if someone makes a joke why would you point out factual inaccuracies? Filtering through a lens of ""sarcasm"" we understand the joke she is really making: some people have such low opinions of women they misinterpret one telling a funny joke as her instead being very misinformed.  The comment at the top is a response by someone who spotted the incongruity and the hidden truth in the statement and was amused by it:   C R Y I N G lmaoooooooo   Sometimes when people laugh very hard, they cry, and ""lmao"" is shorthand for a crude way of saying that you're laughing. The variety of emphasis employed suggests she's laughing very, very hard, signalling that she was incredibly amused. She ""retweeted"" the joke so all her followers could also be amused by it.   At the bottom is a response to this ""retweet"". The avatar suggests a man, and his response is:   Funny or not funny isn't about gender. Talent depends on the individual not in generalities. Plus, tastes vary.   At the surface level he seems to have only understood the original comment at face value, interpreting it as making an actual claim as to whether women can be funny. But on a deeper level, it's funny because the actual meaning of the joke was how men misinterpret women's humor as misinformation, and try to correct it; this man appears to be exemplifying the implied mansplainer of the original joke.  So then one examines this final comment for sarcastic intent. Perhaps the man meant to play along with the joke, and so perform his own joke in that way. However nothing in the content clearly suggests he's aware that his statement wasn't meant to be taken seriously. We are left in the uncomfortable position of not knowing if this man himself was unaware of the humor produced by his statement, or whether he assumed we would all know he actually got the joke and so was replying in very dry humor indeed.  Finally, someone screencapped and shared the image of this conversation, hoping that others would be amused by the unfolding series of incongruities.  tl:dr, if you don't get the joke you're a dude"

Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years' imprisonment, with the possibility of parole in the eighth year, and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army.  Manning is a trans woman who, in a statement the day after sentencing, said she had felt female since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea,  and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy.  From early life and through much of her Army life, Manning was known as Bradley; she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder while in the Army.

Then use your newfound freedom to dress and act in a way that's conventional for your birth sex and deny to everyone (especially yourself) that you ever really wanted it any other way.

I also went through a trans department of a local children's hospital.   YMMV, but it will help if you're lucky and get an open minded therapist. Part of the reason I was so quick was that I explained to my therapist that I had had doubts, but I worked through them and was now confident. That being said, only say that if it's true, honesty is very important and you shouldn't rush over fear of not passing, a few months won't make a noticeable difference in your chance of passing."

The only issue I can see you running into is your age. It may not seem like much, but they're much more willing to trust a 20 year old than someone in her late teens. Although, that bonus may have been negated by my giant beard…  My advice is go for it, but recognize it may take some time, and just be honest and go along with what they say (unless it's something ridiculous like RLE in which case get a new doctor)"

In 7th grade, I took a COGIATI test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for HRT in my area. A hormone test has shown me to be in the 0.1th percentile for testosterone. This is the lowest result the test I was given reaches; anything lower and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's girlfriend of 8 years is a cis woman who attended finishing school. At the age of 15, I understand femininity better than her, and I owe very little of it to her, as she would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding makeup. She's not particularly successful in feminine presentation, but I've met lots of other women who aren't as femme as me, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of her being bad at it."

transgendercirclejerk,39frs6,LikeGoldAndFaceted,11,Thu Jun 11 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"/unjerk One of the main complaints is that they are not being consistent with their censorship. Personally I think reddit should shut down all these hate boards, but then you run into issues like who decides where the line is drawn between simple expression and hate speech and harassment. Many feel reddit is ignoring toxic subreddits that align with the views of admins and want their policy to be consistent. Some people are under the impression that reddit is America and that free speech is a thing, many are also under the impression that freedom of speech means everyone has to listen to and facilitate their bullshit."

Ignoring bigots is the real best practice.  I just find it ironic that these guys are screaming free speech.  As if the ideology they subscribe to even considers free speech important or seeks to protect it in any way.  They act like a private website enforcing rules to limit harassment and provide a more pleasant environment for its user base is oppression.  But the violent harassment and thuggery they do is not in of itself an attempt to limit free speech and expression.   You literally cannot be for free speech and a nazi or ""national socialist"" as the like to be called."

The WBC got sued over a similar issue and heres what the supreme court ruled:    “Speech is powerful,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. “It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and — as it did here — inflict great pain.” But under the First Amendment, he went on, “we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.” Instead, the national commitment to free speech, he said, requires protection of “even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.”"

True Trans Warrior wasn't coded very well (it was actually made by cis people). Anyway, whenever you start a new game, there is a 1/3 chance that The Gatekeeper won't appear as a random encounter in the Forest of The Trans. BUT! There is a way to re-glitch the game into making you find him.  Here's what you do: Go back to the town of Gendar and sleep in the Inn 3 times. Then go outside and save your game. Reset your system. The next part is tricky: you have to go all the way back to the Forest of the Trans without fighting a random encounter. When I did this, I just saved my game like every 3rd or 4th step (if you keep getting an encounter after reloading a save state then completely reset your console to reset the random number generator.  (Side note, if you've completed the quests out of order and have already acquired Forbidden Garments, then wearing them will give you a -5 to random encounters (until you take the Potion of Transformation), which helps a little here.)  OK, once you get all the way back to the forest, go to the waterfall and remove your clothing. The Gatekeeper SHOULD be there. You really want to save before the encounter. There is a 1/4 chance that you'll encounter an ogre-type gatekeeper that is nearly unbeatable."
