elderscrollsonline,3dpgv1,Tx12001,24,Sat Jul 18 14:20:02 2015 UTC,That's what we need instead of more reskinned horses.
elderscrollsonline,3dpgv1,TeamRedundancyTeam,5,Sat Jul 18 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, but I think as far as immersion goes it's bad enough that ZOS has made a habit of releasing fancy effect horses. The last thing we need is hundreds of camels running around. Adding stuff like fancy glowing horses and too many mount types is a quick way to start looking more like WoW and other themeparks.   I don't want to see a unicorn-pegasus running around with glowing effects and fifteen kinds of particles flowing behind it."
elderscrollsonline,3dpgv1,Tx12001,2,Sun Jul 19 00:28:31 2015 UTC,Well camels are already in the game as passive creatures and in the Alik'r desert load screen a redguard appears to be riding one so they are a very lorefriendly mount.

Since killing the NPC doesn't advance progress in the blocked state, it's a bug.  It's unexpected behaviour regardless of the circumstances that cause it to occur.   What's worse is that it wasn't fix prior to release(same issue on PC at launch) and the fact that whatever script the mission follows doesn't account for the game being an MMO."

Guilds are allotted a number of group channels depending on how many members they have.  The only weird thing about the system is that you can't completely pick and choose which channels you want to be in. Like you can only be in one ""main"" channel and one ""guild"" channel at the same time.  That problem aside I really like how its implemented."

While you can focus on the main quest, a lot of people started focusing on pvp as soon as possible, leaving the main quest as it is. ESO gives you all the choice you can have. How you handle your ingame time, how you make your builds. I suggest just trying some skills and feel for yourself if you like them or not. You can always respec later on (for an amount of gold).

You also get skill points from a fair number of main quests.  The dungeons are a huge amount of fun. Usually you get 2 DPS + 1 Tank + 1 Healer. Standard MMO style. Anyone can do any role as long as they're trained/specced for it.  The end game dungeons are amazingly hella fun as /u/koendrenthe put it.    As far as builds? Eh, until you hit max level just try to train up lots of different skills. That way when you hit end game you can do all the tweaking and theorycrafting to be stronger. It shouldn't make a huge difference while leveling. If you want any advice, then I would say make sure you get as many skills to 'Morph' (level 4 skill) as possible."
elderscrollsonline,3dqm72,Koendrenthe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:58:03 2015 UTC,"yes, and by use of skills. The story does unlock the soul skill tree, but it's not really worth the trouble if only doing for it. The main story is pretty awesome tough."

elderscrollsonline,3dr87n,cadeross,4,Sat Jul 18 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"You need to figure out the ebb and flow.  Keep your eye on the map for the hot spots.....keeps being sieged, attacks on scroll temples etc.  Assuming the map situation is fairly balanced and the inner ring is being contested back and forth you should have no problem finding defensive fights to participate in.  In zone chat you will see recruiting adverts like type this word to join a group.  Or you can just ask around and get an invite.  If you want to solo then look for flagged enemy keeps and figure out where the reinforcements will come from.  Pick a location along that route and you will find opportunities to waylay hapless riders racing to arrive at the keep in time.  Some days it's just one continuous skirmish between an outpost and a keep.  You can basically just march back and forth until some organized group decides to go after a keep further down the chain.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone from brk to sej or sej to alessia.  A couple of days ago there was a 6 hour period where ep and dc just ran back and forth from bleaks to ales.  It's actually quite a lot of fun since it is mindless in a strategic sense.  Pro tip.  If a group takes one of your keeps resources and then they all run inside and wait for you to do something, they are putting on their farming trousers and want you to be the crop.  Sometimes they might put up some token siege and then run back into the tower when you push at them.  If you are going to go after them it's best to not take the resource and just demolish the tower assuming you have a big enough group of pitchforks.  If they can't get you to take the resource and then walk in through the front door for your surprise, at some point they will decide it is farming time anyway and pour out of the tower to get your ap....so be prepared."

If that's the case, I would just go to an area I knew to be the appropriate level and look for clusters of mobs, kill a few to check the respond timer, and if it worked I'd start grinding. If not, move to another area.  There's no big secret to grinding, just find an area that either has: 1) medium sized group of mobs on short respawns, or 2) large group of mobs with moderate respawns."
elderscrollsonline,3drszb,Yarbs89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, grinding spawns is actually faster than questing.  I went from level 40 to 49 in literally two short-ish days of grinding.  I don't know what the rate of experience gain difference is, but I know that it would have taken me at least 3x as long to do that with just quests.  I'd suggest finding a delve in Cyrodiil for the most efficient grinds - specifically the cracked wood cave.  There are 3 bosses, mobs spawn really fast, and if you can piggyback off of a really high level who AoEs the shit outta big groups, even better."

elderscrollsonline,3drjbt,Loki_99,2,Sat Jul 18 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"Copy/Paste from an earlier post I made:  DK tanking most important skills in my opinion:  Pierce Armor/inner fire: can't tank effectively without taunts.  Hardened Armor: huge, long lasting survivability buff. You should have this up at all times when tanking.  Obsidian Shield: group shield. Long lasting. Turn your magika into health.  Green Dragon Blood: emergency self heal, long lasting regen buff.  Extended Chains: need to pull something off the healer? Don't want to cross the room first? Ferocious Leap: make a splash, gain a shield.  Magma Shell: need to be really hard to kill for 10 seconds? Use this.   Situational skills:  Ash Cloud: good for AoE aggro generation. Burning Talons: good crowd control. Any synergy is great once you're high enough in undaunted  Max out all of your passives in draconic power, earthen heart, heavy armor and 1H + Shield.   Spiked Bone shield is amazing if you need to fill out an ability bar.   Get caltrops. Use caltrops for AoE aggro.   Get Defensive Stance. It belongs on your tanking bar.   Get someone to make you a 5 piece heavy armor Whitestrake's set every 6-8 levels. Or learn to make it yourself. That 5 piece bonus will save your butt.   Practice blocking heavy blows, not standing in the red circles, and interrupting spells.   If you have to choose, let the DPS die. Save the healer. Save yourself.   Go 2:1 health to stamina while you're leveling. It's a cheap respec when you hit veteran ranks. Get max health, stamina regen, and magika regen in that order.   See how that advice helps you out.

I never used it in vet areas but I'll try to give you some tips that I used to stay alive.   Bosses were tough. With all magicka and no health, I had problems with them too. I used a heavy chest, and medium legs for a little extra armor and to level the skill lines. Try to use Sun Shield(blazing shield) to absorb some damage. Keep breath of life on your backup bar for those oh shit moments. Empowering sweep ultimate reduces the amount of damage enemies do to you, same with solar prison/disturbance.  If you use puncturing sweep like you said (magicka jabs), try to group up enemies and hit as many as possible with it. Honestly I had better survivability against a group of 10 than 1 because of the healing from jabs.  You said you don't use vampire skills but the ultimate has a morph where you steal health from nearby foes. It is really great and only costs 150 ultimate. I'd give it a shot.   If I think of anything else, I'll try to edit this. The stamina build that I recently switched to has a lot of survivability, I really like it but it's not for everyone."

elderscrollsonline,3dq53f,LyonheartAz,0,Sat Jul 18 20:28:03 2015 UTC,pure magic light armour builds are squishy. they are called glass cannons for a reason. You can try to swap some points to health. Also play a little bit with your armor. When i go magic user i always make my body armour heavy and pants medium so you'll still get the advantage from the 5 piece light bonus plus have some extra armor. Don't forget to block and heal.
elderscrollsonline,3dqesh,GoPackGo007,4,Sat Jul 18 13:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. Actually your best bet is one Heavy piece (chest) and one Medium piece (head or legs). Better protection, and you get the benefits of the Undaunted Mettle passive (+6% to all stats at Undaunted Rank 9)."
elderscrollsonline,3dqesh,BurlyHeart,3,Sat Jul 18 13:18:53 2015 UTC,Follow this guys advice. i use this gearbuild with my nightblade and it works like a charm.
elderscrollsonline,3dqesh,Koendrenthe,2,Sat Jul 18 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"As others have said, there is the Undaunted passive which gives a bonus for each armor type you wearing. However, unless you have at least one point in that passive, there's no pressing need to wear all three since two heavy pieces will give you more armor, which is a direct immediate benefit.  The only reasons to wear a medium piece before then are:   You want to level medium so that you can have the Evasion active ability. You want to level medium so that you can unlock the passives because you want to build a Stamina-based character in the future.   In either of those cases, you would want a piece with the Training trait on it. Might be good for your two heavies (or one heavy) to have that trait as well."
elderscrollsonline,3dqesh,NathanDickson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"Takes a while to get to undaunted 9, until then 5-2 is a nice split. A bit skill point heavy if you want the full passive line from both, but if you've got it pretty solid."

elderscrollsonline,3dpz9s,TheKeifChief,6,Sat Jul 18 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"For a blanket response regarding the races, I feel the weakest links (loyalty-wise) for each faction would be:   AD - Wood Elves - they seem to have the weakest reason to be behind Ayrenn's cause. But still this isn't as strong a reason as some of the other factions, which makes AD the most solid IMO. DC - Orcs - Both of their current allies have warred against and even teamed up on the Orcs in the past (and will do so again after the events of ESO). I really can't see the Orcs viewing the Bretons and Redguards with any sense of trust regarding their promises for Orsinium. EP - Argonians - Their mistreatment by the Dunmer is still so fresh in terms of history, I still find it to be unlikely that they are even in this faction, despite their alliance during the Akaviri Invasion a decade previously.   But if you decide to go another with a less obvious race for a 'disloyal' backstory, think smaller scale. My AD sorc is a Reachman, (so basically a Breton racially) who despises the Nords and Bretons so AD is his home (enemy of my enemy). Your character could also be a mercenary, be in love with someone in your faction, or perhaps raised by kindly foster parents of another race."
elderscrollsonline,3dpz9s,djyrb,4,Sat Jul 18 14:48:14 2015 UTC,From AD I could suggest the Khajit or Wood Elf - I don't want to spoil in case you haven't played AD faction story but there is some significant mistreatment that could cause for some to reject the AD.

There is a specific command for this (assuming they are using Cisco network equipment), but nothing that pertains to your situation.  To be honest, I'm not sure why they recommended using tracert. Even if you did find something (such as a slow response time from one of the routers), there would be nothing you could do from your end. The best you could do is notify your ISP or the ISP at fault, but chances are, they would already have been aware of the situation.  First question I will ask is whether you are using wired or wireless? Be honest because for some reason, a lot of people won't admit to using wireless. Wireless is actually very good now-a-days and a lot more secure than people know."

elderscrollsonline,3dr4xu,Tierney11290,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:04 2015 UTC,Are you using 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz? 2.4Ghz will have a bit more interference (as I mentioned in another comment). It could just be a coincidence because of the time you are playing the game.   I do find it odd though that it is happening only in this game and not in others.
elderscrollsonline,3dr4xu,valleyspirit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly,-- OP, you already know you have a problem, and tracert may let you say, ""It's my ISP"", but in the big picture you already know that.  There is nothing magical at the ESO servers end that is somehow singling you out to screw you. I can't think of anything you can do to let ESO know that ""you really are a good person and they should connect you faster"". Wireless can be great but the first thing I would do is try a wired connection. Then I would consider switching providers.  Your ISP has multiple routing paths to everywhere in the world, and if the top ""x"" paths to a certain set of servers somewhere in the world, gets full, they automatically start providing less-ideal paths. ISPs also have what is called the funnel problem, where their local connections (your house, your neighborhood, your town) have to be squeezed onto the superhighway onramps, so to speak. Even if someone two blocks away has zero lag, it could be that once a week, everyone on your street streams movies at the same time, and your block is now automatically uses a set of less-optimized paths, or a different set of (overloaded) hardware, so everything works reasonably at peak.  These days, the issue is usually equivalent to, ""my mail is slow"". You can measure your mailbox but I doubt it's going to affect how often someone drives by to put mail in it. And you may say, ""I get mail from California, really fast. How come my mail from North Dakota is so slow?"" Maybe it will help if you go measure your mailbox again. Or you can try running a network cable real quick, to see if there is actually something slow in your wireless firmware or wireless drivers."

Is your router older than 4 years old? You should upgrade it anyway. It's free to do. If it fixes it, you win, right?  You're not running 6G of ram are you? At 4G on some machines, it just crashes out to desktop pretty regularly. I doubt 6G is enough. Have you upgraded your ~machine's~ network drivers?  I hate seeing ""AT&T"" in a network-related post. AT&T could be throttling game packets for streaming media preference. Does it happen in the middle of the night, like 2am? I think Netflix is still causing provider optimizations on a regular basis.

Killing enemies is another way. At lvl 40 or so I was getting 100+ gold of multiple mobs.  At lvl 10 you can go to pvp area and do the PVE quests there. They give lots gold too and xp.  Sure stealing is one way but takes long time and chance to get caught and all items confiscated.   Another thing if  your lvling up don't repair items just replace them instead. Saves lots of money."

For a tank this is pretty important.  That said, later in the game you might find that having some extra magicka and stamina regen are more important than the extra armor. Also, there are passives that get better whilst wearing more varieties of armor.  As a V14 tank, I experimented with running 7 heavy, but went back to using 5/1/1 as I missed the magicka and stamina regen buffs. Your mileage will vary, based on your play style."

elderscrollsonline,3dqvq7,Godzeela,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:50:08 2015 UTC,Battle leveling is referring to PvP level scaling and balancing to my understanding
elderscrollsonline,3dqvq7,Godzeela,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it says players can opt into it. My question is, if you have, for example, a VR8, with good gear, would it be worth scaling yourself to what a VR14 in moderate gear would be, since it'll bring with it a 50% decrease to damage, healing, and shields?  And does this mean that battle leveled players will be doing half the damage a VR14 does? I don't really know how it all works currently, which is why I'm asking these questions."

elderscrollsonline,3dqtoc,Novuna,3,Sat Jul 18 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"It's really about you, and the game you're looking for, not the factions. A lot of new players are coming to this game with pre-conceived notions from other franchises which have no bearing here. Orcs are evil, and elves are good, except for Dark Elves, who clearly must be evil since they're dark. This is all bullshit in TES. But a lot of players don't figure this out before selecting a character, if they ever do.  AD is bright and vibrant, EP is more gloomy, DC is in the middle. But these are generalizations. Rivenspire is considered one of the darker, gloomier territories in DC, but it's also got some bright and beautiful vistas, too.  AD is high fantasy, EP is grittier, and DC has a lot of intrigue and comedy. But, again, generalizations.  The vast majority of TES nostalgia trippers go for EP. For reasons entirely beyond my understanding, some people also like elves, cats, and Kate Beckinsale, so AD gets that crowd. TES vets looking for something completely new would also go to AD.  DC's appeal is more subtle, but still there. There are TES II fans out there, too, and it has a certain Game of Thrones flavor to it. One of the reasons I like it is because it's not as populated as the other factions, so there's less obnoxious chatter. And while it doesn't often win in PvP, it does often get to decide who wins.  The real thing to remember is, ALL the alliances are jokes, which is why the alliance partisans are silly. The alliances are futilely squabbling amongst each other as the world is dragged down into hell. And regardless of how many times a faction wins a campaign, their efforts all fail. Except, perhaps, for DC, since DC is looking to liberate Cyrodiil, not conquer it, and that's what ultimately happens.   But the point is, don't get invested in a single alliance, certainly not based on the opinions of others. Consider trying all three, see which appeals to you."

PvP deaths never really had a risk in this game (other than having to play horse simulator once camps were removed).  Now there is a high risk and higher reward.
elderscrollsonline,3dobft,xaraan,4,Sat Jul 18 01:10:48 2015 UTC,Unless you zerg.  Then you see very little to no risk for small reward that adds up to great reward as they continue to zerg at little risk.
elderscrollsonline,3dobft,MosDeAtmo,2,Sat Jul 18 02:46:10 2015 UTC,Actually that is an interesting question. What happens when 10+ players all hit one other player with about 50 Stones. Is the loot still divided between them all? So they would get 5 Stones each?

Probably just more of an open fighting area with PvE mobs where you fight players.  Unfortunately I'm thinking zergs will still reign because it won't be like the 4v4 stuff we saw from some of the cons.

Zenimax adding veterans ranks again makes me think they're either not listening or they haven't touched the Imperial City content in months. It's very dissapointing if the game turns out this way. I think alot of people we're expecting the arena, doesn't matter if it was PVP or PVE. The Imperial City needs an Arena. If it's not added it's not complete nor worth my time (atleast not for $25)."

Currently level 30.   First, equip 5 piece medium, 1 light, 1 heavy. This is to level all armor skill lines while you level up, just in case you want to go tanky later or try a light armor magicka build  Second, make sure that 1 skill is equipped from every class skill tree. This allows each skill line to level while you do, same logic as the armor I mentioned earlier  Then - put points into all the combat abilities you're interested in using for your 2h, dw, bow. Get all passives available that are relevant to you as a Stam nightblade such as decreased Stam cost on attacks or extra crit etc.   You'll likely have a bunch left - I used them to get the passives that cause resources to highlight with a glow in the world. Can't recall the name - but you can get it in the crafting trees for the various crafting skills.   But really you can use them however you'd like.   This should make you effective and you'll still have extras.   I put attribute points at about a 2:1 ratio for Stam and hp. I think at 30 I have 10 hp and 19 Stam. I struggle with bigger packs but I've worked around that by being quick with the dodge and using mark to return hp when a target dies.   Have fun!"

elderscrollsonline,3dpzmy,etionee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:12:20 2015 UTC,Just put points in the skills you're trying to level first. Then after that see if you need more help with your resources or survivability and plan from there.

I'll be honest, I really appreciate them coming out with new purchasable items on a semi-regular basis. It keeps the game fresh for some people, and to be honest, at least shows that they are still somewhat focused on developing and molding this game.   But let's also be straightforward here and say; a soul-shriven outfit? Really? To each his own, but come on, you want me to pay 700 crowns in order to wear rags? Now if this package comes with other clothing options included for purchase like, say, the groom outfit I mentioned earlier, I could see the appeal. But pushing the soul shriven clothes like they are the next Emperor outfit is pretty silly.   But hey, just remember guys...at least they aren't Bungie."
elderscrollsonline,3dmgwc,Koendrenthe,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:22 2015 UTC,It's a low budget process with easy profit. it's a smart move trying to sell this junk. I'm going to buy it anyway. i'm a sucker like that.

I hate to say ""transmog system pls"" but that's still basically the thrust of the need.  If we can't mix/match and dye the armor pieces, then the costumes are only filling a really niche need on the crown store.  If we could buy armor piece looks individually and couple it to the dyeing system, I think there would much higher sales.  Save costumes for actual unique looks that can't be reproduced with armor, like the wedding dress or jester outfits!"

But undyeable costumes that are just armor equivalents?  Pretty much the only people who are liking that are EP Ordinator RPers.  And, yanno, more power to them, but I bet even they wish they could dye the armor differently, or change out a certain armor piece here and there.  It's most noticeable in high-end raiding and PvP, where people are forced to wear a combination of set XYZ but it's all this terrible mishmash of styles that even Mauloch would turn up his nose to."

elderscrollsonline,3dmgwc,nebasuke,2,Fri Jul 17 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"No. It depends on whether you get almost exactly the crowns needed, or the 5500 crown pack. 5500 crowns are $39.99, so $39.99/5500*2200 = $16. Still a lot for a horse and almost as much as the Imperial City expansion (which is 2500 crowns)."

elderscrollsonline,3dmgwc,SkeletonChief,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:26 2015 UTC,I think that's what most of the store items are aimed for anyway. They give ESO+ players some items to get for their monthly crowns. I don't imagine there are many people who skip ESO+ but just buy a horse.

Make them all look sporty? Make them all look fancy, make them all look expensive. It doesn't cost more to make a cars body shaped different. Same thing here. Why make another horse? We have too many already. Why even bother with those costumes? They don't look cool. People want to look cool. The pet? It's a rat. I can think of so many awesome things that could be in the crown store yet we get things like this.  What would be more ' different ' or ' cool '. This horse or a giant mechanical dwarven spider thing? Sputtering and shaking with steam puffing from its joints. Like we fight in the ruins? No. Let's have another horse with some lightning on it."

The reason they do it is it takes almost no time and makes them a ton of money because people see it and buy whats available.  They will keep pumping these out and drip feeding them to the market as $20+ dollar exclusives so the people with lots of disposable income they want to spend on the game will keep buying them (and from what I see in game there are a lot of these people) before they feel the need to make something that's actually a bit cooler (like the bears... of which we will have 10+ versions of).  If you think about it if they can make $20 for an afternoons work for an artist as opposed to $60 for the entire game it's obvious why they do it."

If you play your character well though, nobody is going to be upset over the gain or loss of a few thousand dps.  The standard ""good"" dps is around 8-10k single target, while ""great"" dps is 14-16k. Everyone (any race/class) can achieve those numbers if played and geared well.  Uber geared and specced Dunmer Fire DKs can get upwards of 18-20k, but like I said, so long as you're pulling 8-10k, nobody will ever complain. This isn't WoW.   I wouldn't worry too much about the metas though, as Update 7 is right around the corner and things are likely to shift, as they always do.  Play what you like."

elderscrollsonline,3dpc99,sAnn92,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:57 2015 UTC,I've had this happen to me recently. Our team took an elder scroll and while running back someone threw caltrops in front of us and I died instantly along with like 6 other people. My death recap just said camouflaged hunter.
elderscrollsonline,3dpc99,Moonplux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"I tried this combo a while ago and here is what I can tell you about it:   The description says ""15% chance [...] against undead [...] 4% chance against other enemies [...] If in stealth your next attack deals x additional Magic Damage to undead"". So the 100% proc from stealth only works on vampires and with the passive on transformed werewolves. Once it procs you are engaged in combat and go out of stealth. It does not seem to count NB cloak invisibility as stealth though and you only get the 15% chance. I did 900 + 5.6k damage to a vampire on a successful tick which is not all that much when you only hit 15% of the time. During the whole time where I used this combo, I only managed to kill 1 player with it.    Not really what I would call an exploit or OP."
elderscrollsonline,3dpc99,insidiat0r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"While what you say is true, there must still be something that isn't functioning correctly with the skill, as I was running with entire zergs into a keep and every player who set foot in the AoE of the Caltrops thrown by this specific player was insta-nuked, and surely not everyone was a Vampire/Transformed WW (although admittedly I am a Vampire myself.)  That aside, however, the whole point of the post wasn't to claim that Camouflaged Hunter ITSELF was OP, rather that the combination of it with Caltrops was OP because something is broken. Sure, the ""900 + 5.6k damage"" you claim it ticked for itself is rather moderate damage, but it doesn't only tick once if the player is constantly sitting there spamming Camo Hunter while people walk through their Caltrops and fall over dead. I don't know how much truth there is to the idea that it pulls you out of stealth upon proc either, because I assure you I saw nearly entire groups of my alliance drop dead when setting foot in the giant AoE and all I hear in area chat is ""What the fuck is Camouflaged Hunter!?""  I intend to go back into Cyrodiil more today, if this happens again I won't miss the chance to record it this time.  Again, I don't fully understand where the exploit with this skill truly lies, but it has become fairly obvious that something is wrong when one player can kill 20+ people by crouching and pressing two buttons. You can't tell me you think that's intended."

Not only does it proc this skill, but it also proc's several other (melee only type) effects (I won't list all of the things you can exploit) as well.  If they fixed the procs from it and kept it from overlapping (throwing five caltrops aoes on top of each other shouldn't stack imo - that's not how caltrops work, spreading them out should be the aim) then it would fix a lot of different issues."

The other parts of the set bonuses don't apply, with the exception of weapon crit and regen. Traits on weapons and armor do apply, weapon enchants do apply, but armor enchants do not apply. On jewelry, i'm certain that cost reduction and flame resistance apply, however they are the only two that i've tested. So to answer you question, hist bark and magnus both apply, along with every other 5 piece set bonus.  Hope I helped! :)"

From the Remanada, the origin legend of Emperor Reman Cyrodiil I:  ""And the spirit fled from them, and they split among hills and forests to find her, all grieving that they had become a villainous people. Hrol and his shieldthane were the only ones to find her, and the king spoke to her, saying, I love you sweet Aless, sweet wife of Shor and of Auri-el and the Sacred Bull, and would render this land alive again, not through pain but through a return to the dragon-fires of covenant, to join east and west and throw off all ruin. And the shieldthane bore witness to the spirit opening naked to his king, carving on a nearby rock the words AND HROL DID LOVE UNTO A HILLOCK before dying in the sight of their union. When the fifteen other knights found King Hrol, they saw him dead after his labors against a mound of mud. And they parted each in their way, and some went mad, and the two that returned to their homeland beyond Twil would say nothing of Hrol, and acted ashamed for him. But after nine months that mound of mud became as a small mountain, and there were whispers among the shepherds and bulls. A small community of believers gathered around that growing hill during the days of its first churning, and they were the first to name it the Golden Hill, Sancre Tor. And it was the shepherdess Sed-Yenna who dared climb the hill when she heard his first cry, and at its peak she saw what it had yielded, an infant she named Reman, which is ""Light of Man.""  Tl;dr Hrol done sexed a mound of soil till he died and baby Reman popped out. I found a joke item that references this, it was a proud and hilarious day for my inner lore geek."

So he's probably using the Inner Light morph of Magelight, which gives a bonus to Magicka instead of exposing stealthed opponents in PvP. A bonus to Magicka is always useful to have active when swapping bars as a Magicka user."
elderscrollsonline,3dp5v1,NathanDickson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:54:46 2015 UTC,"AHH so if I keep it on both bars, then the effect won't go away when I bar swap?   I swap like a madman to activate some HoT's and runes, then switch to some quick dps like spear shards and sweeping blades."
elderscrollsonline,3dp5v1,NathanDickson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Correct. Any ability which acts as a toggle--Magelight, Sorc pets, the DK fire thingy--stays on if you put it on both bars, but they have to be in the same slot."
elderscrollsonline,3dp5v1,canicomethrough,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:55 2015 UTC,Did not know it would stay active if on both bars. Sorry. The only problem with having the same ability on both bars is that you lose the option of an extra ability. But like I said I have to have cloak one both bars.

Currently my ""IDK-Dragon Elf-guy"" uses a bow with spells for long engagement/pokeballs soul trapping , and I use his chains to isolate an enemy or bring me into the fray.   I assume this is as close to the PC version we will gett, which I haven't seen and I always assumed had a larger active skill bar.

Pick Stamina or Magicka and stick with it with Health interspersed as needed. You can respec, for a price. The farther along you are the more expensive it gets. Call your character whatever you like. Toon, Bob, Potato, whatever. There are general guides available. I suggest starting with ESO Academy. However much you get into spoilers is your own decision. You can solo, but if you have a partner team up! Check out the Pledge of Mara, you'll both get XP boosts for playing together.   It's a huge game with almost endless possibilities, so have fun!

And get yelled at when she gets out, because males only need 15 minutes to get ready, and why aren't you doing something around the house to help?  Then before you know it, it's a Saturday and you've got the house to yourself.

A lot of people with beefier computers get worse fps than shitty laptops.  My 980/i7 3770 runs it at 20fps even on lowest graphics. It's literally the only game I play that I can't max with 60+ fps.  As far as game depth and scope....there's really shit all in the game big open world with some trees and rocks and couple landmarks, some basic items and a basing living/building system. Plus of course the dinosaurs but all they are is giant models that run at you and you can ride, they don't have AAA ai systems or anything.

Then again, it is also in ALPHA...  As far as the AAA quality goes, that is all open to interpretation and I guess faith that all of the planned features they intend to implement before release actually get added...Between the HUGE maps (plural planned), modding capability, planned story mode, planned expansion of the crafting system to allow for mounting weapons on dino's and adding other tech...Integrating FPS/strategy/offline raid notifications, land sea and air attack avenues, massive stat customization options, huge benefits to co-op gameplay, etc. provides much more play depth than most multi-player games recently.  As for the direction it is going not being consistent with AAA visions, you hit that nail on the head for sure...The devs are very community driven and active on the forums and on reddit and have actually created something innovative instead of following the AAA cookie-cutter money making formulas...Honestly (and ESO is an exception, but Bethseda's games usually are) most AAA games have disappointed me for a long time now and I stick almost entirely to indie/small studio games because I prefer innovation/challenging gameplay/unguided open world do-what-you-want play styles."

elderscrollsonline,3dk5vj,Spike2k187,45,Fri Jul 17 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"Video games don't 'ruin life', they're just another human passtime that we might enjoy.  Video Games just have this outdated, misguided negative stigma attached to them in society that coin this phrase.  It's like saying watching TV, listening to music, going to the gym or 'working' for a living is a 'life ruiner'  Not at all IMHO.   It's all a matter of perspective.  We all have passions, we all have things we like to do in our own time.  Some things we do take a front seat in our life more than others.  I'm in my 4th decade as a gamer and I can assure you I've literally spent years of my life just playing video games when you put it all together.  I don't regret a single second of it.  Not - one - second.  I'm married with kids, a good job and live a happy, stable lifestyle.  Nope, sorry to disappoint the rest of society, I'm a well adjusted human being - and I game as my primary hobby.  Go figure.  Video gaming is part of who we are.  Some do it more than others.  It's all about finding the right balance between everything you do in life and enjoying your hobby.  But I get those feels about finding that one game experience where you invest so much of your free time it starts to feel like it owns you.  Been there, done that.  I played World of Warcraft for over 8 years, my main character a year and a half of played time.  Don't regret a second of it either.  ESO has that kind of lure and pull for me too.    There's nothing wrong with that at all as long as you can find the right balance between 'real life' and your gaming passion.  I game, therefore I am.  - veteran gamer proverb"

I stayed out of trouble when I was younger because of Super Nintendo, N64, PS1, PS2, etc. I went to school, finished my degree, and for 3 years I've been in my 'grown up job'. I love going home and playing whatever I am interested in at the moment. It's the EXACT same thing as someone setting aside the time to watch a TV show, or Netflix, or even reading a book. How can it be a waste of time if I love doing it? Working my life away is a waste of time because I have really no choice. Idk, who cares. I love it."

elderscrollsonline,3dk5vj,Ubiquitous_Cacophony,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"But I get those feels about finding that one game experience where you invest so much of your free time it starts to feel like it owns you. Been there, done that. I played World of Warcraft for over 8 years, my main character a year and a half of played time. Don't regret a second of it either.   This was interesting.  I never thought of the unique ability in video games to form an attachment to a character that YOU made. I also think it is amazing that video games can provide to someone a connection to a character and your friends for YEARS.  I played Maplestory for all of 5-6 years before it went to crap and had the same character all that time for the most part. I remember the name, class, favorite quests, friends I made and all that stuff.   Up until recently, I began viewing all video games including ESO as this huge waste of time. However, I realized earlier this month actually that there really is a pure joy that comes from creating characters and experiencing a world and story outside your own, and even experience it with friends, all over a years time length. No movie, TV show, or book can hold a group of friends or my personal attention for years. It really is something profound and I enjoy every moment of it.  But it is important to balance it. That's where some people struggle (especially with MMOs), and that's where the negative 'gamer' stigma comes from I believe.  Either way, life is really about finding/spreading/experiencing happiness (among other emotions). Why take away something that brings you so much joy, without causing any real harm?  IMO, unless you're actively ignoring responsibilities or falling behind in life, game on. There's no reason not to."

One thing to watch for though is that you make sure to keep a current graphics driver install file handy. Windows 10 has this annoying habit (currently anyway) of wanting to ""help"" you and shove it's unaccelerated WDM reference drivers in place of your vendor supplied accelerated drivers during windows update patches. I hope this is just a beta build quirk, but, FYI and YMMV."

In-game notification won't work imo, players already see that they are grouped and don't give an f about that. It's good to be a group leader in that situation because you can kick uncooperative players and join the queue for replacements.  Also, it gets better after lvl 45 with Undaunted pledges. From my experience people doing pledge dungeons don't goof around and travel there almost right away.  And finally, sometimes it helps not to wait for the last person. If you have 3 people in the dungeon, you're ready to go. Normal dungeons are easy enough for 3 people with healer\tank or enough health sustain."

The zoo had obtained, through questionable means, a rare Imga for its exhibits from deep in the most primeval parts of the Valenwood.  Within a few weeks the Imga, a female, became very difficult to handle. Upon examination, the Altmer handlers determined the problem. The Imga was in heat. To make matters worse, there was no male Imga available. In a desperate hope to solve the problem, the Zoo Keeper approached a local Bosmer transplant, Fargorith, with a proposition. Would he be willing to mate with the Imga for 500 gold pieces?  Fargorith showed some interest but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, he announced that he would accept their offer, but only under four conditions.   ""First"", Fargorith said, ""I ain't gonna kiss her on the lips."" The Keeper quickly agreed to this condition.   ""Second"", he said, ""You can't never tell no one about this."" The Keeper again readily agreed to this condition.   ""Third"", Fargorith said, ""I want all the children raised adherin' to the green pact."" Once again it was agreed.

elderscrollsonline,3dlork,MelGibsonMeinFuhrer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:44 2015 UTC,I believe it's referring to that bosmer are sometimes cannibalistic of other elves. But also that Altmer probably taste terrible.

Most of stam builds atm get there survivability from dodge rolling. However you could just run food as well which at v14 will give you about 3.5k more hp
elderscrollsonline,3dp392,rawisshawn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:58 2015 UTC,I'd say you want to put some points into health regardless of whether you're magicka or stamina based. I put one point into health for every 3 or 4 I put into stamina.

elderscrollsonline,3dp392,JayScraffy,0,Sat Jul 18 03:07:48 2015 UTC,Never go stamina and magicka. One should always have a 0 next to it.
elderscrollsonline,3dp392,NathanDickson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:24:39 2015 UTC,"If you are doing solo PvE content, go all Magicka or all Stamina, depending upon your build. You can pretty much ignore Health because things should be dying very quickly when you build a glass cannon.  If you are running Veteran Dungeons or 12-man Trials, then at least 18k health is advised... 20k is preferable. You can get that from being some races, putting points into Health and by eating buff food (blue quality is typically very good unless you are tanking, at which point purple is probably best).  If you are tanking those same runs, then 30k is advisable, which you will probably get via points, food, possibly a racial as well as enchants on gear.  If you are doing PvP, then Health is always going to benefit survivability as it can get brutal out there. Just don't go so far into Health that you gimp yourself on damage output."

Once you start getting more skills and morphs you can be a tanky nightmare while doing decent DPS. I have a DPS S/S bar for just standard damage, then a ""prefight"" or tank bar. I'll pop my damage shields and green dragons blood then rush in and start the DPS. Its been so fun for me. Yeah, little slower but the flow of combat seems more fun to me and not just nuking people. I never die anymore, ever. Extremely hard to die even to much higher levels. This is just me, but I'm sure running this with the tank S/S then a 2h/DW would be very effective!

They're pretty good for those times when I just wanna go kill things.  Public Dungeons are kinda like that, too, but bigger. They have maybe half-a-dozen bosses in 'em, and enough bad guys that you want a friend to come with you. They also have some kind of small wave event hidden away, too, which can give you a skill point. Definitely worth the time.  Both Delves and Public Dungeons usually have some small quest associated with them, and there're achievements for doing them.  So, while ESO doesn't have a whole lot of quests that are quite that short and simple, it does have places to scratch that itch, IMO."

My should magic shatter did a lot of damage to foes attacking me directly that it usually got me out of trouble.

elderscrollsonline,3do3hk,versi0n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:24 2015 UTC,Imperials are more defensive with health and stamina boosts.  Typically the health boost just translates into a slightly lower Magicka boost as you build for x health then pump the rest to magicka  Altmer more offensive  Breton have good sustain.  Differences aren't that pronounced tho
elderscrollsonline,3do3hk,iTwitchyy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'm an Imperial and though my Destro Staff is at 50 (I leveled 1-49 with all my attributes in magicka, became a pure resto/healer for vet dungeons though) I would highly suggest not choosing Sorceror. I mean the stamina and health passives are some of, if not the best, generally speaking, but its final passive will be basically useless to you, as well as the boost in experience for 1h/s.   Go Breton if you want a human race, but lemme tell you, I've ran dungeons with 3 high elf dps sorcerors and me as a hybrid tank/healer and the speed at which enemies' health falls is truly insane."
elderscrollsonline,3do3hk,Thermalman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:55 2015 UTC,Hmmm I'm not sure if your build is correct then. I've played with high elf DPS and yes they do hit harder but they go down pretty fast if not spec'd correctly. Most of what I've seen are glass cannons. I mean that's great and all but you're not gonna do more overall DPS if you keep dying. I've been able to keep up with the amount of DPS with my imperial and I haven't even equipped my dual wield swords yet. With certain sets you can honestly hit more than a high elf since I'd assume most go for some sets that make you a little more tankie so they won't go down as fast. And that final passive isn't useless if you know what to do with it like using dual wield for the added spell damage and added passive go restore health every time you hit someone.
elderscrollsonline,3do3hk,djyrb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:22:39 2015 UTC,The xp boosts aren't worth even considering.  By around level 40 you can have the skill Line maxed and it has zero effect after that
elderscrollsonline,3do3hk,Thermalman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"Altmer is the best choice for a Magicka DPS sorcerer IMO, but if you want to play a non-Mer race, then go for Breton. The only racial passive you will miss is the Elemental Damage buff that the Altmer offers; otherwise you get the same amount of Max Magicka, as well as a slight reduction to spell cost (which is somewhat parallel to the Altmer's magicka recovery bonus).  Although their racial passives don't directly benefit casters, Imperials are also a solid choice, especially if you think you might venture into other types of non-magicka builds, such as a Stamina DPS or tank sorc."

elderscrollsonline,3dkrm7,ActionFlank,5,Sun Jul 19 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"So, it seems that I made a mistake - I'm not sure whether that ""rakes in"" figure is correct or not. In the linked article, there was an image showing the indexed total earnings of various titles. ESO's bar graph showed a number slightly above 50. Nowhere in the image or the article does it say this figure is in US$ millions. However, the article does have this tidbit:     That game [ESO] was enough to push the market for non-free-to-play MMOs to $50 million, which is up 7 percent year-over-year. And The Elder Scrolls Online was able to make an impressive debut on consoles and come in just behind Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Grand Theft Auto V on the top digital games list.     I seemed to have extrapolated off of this, and mistakenly believed the graph/image showed sales in US$ millions.    As of now, I still don't know what that number is. For a moment, I thought it showed earnings as a percentage of that of the top game (AW), but even that is questionable since AW's chart doesn't touch the 100 mark either.    But we do know that it sold 138k digital copies and was #4 in the UK for the same."
elderscrollsonline,3dkrm7,Kaladinar,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"138K*60=8M, 280K."

They'd be smart to back up character files but it isn't something that has to be there for the game to operate. It's possible that they only backup during specific times that character files are more likely to be corrupted/ destroyed and then wipe them afterwards. It's also possible that they play fast and loose with our time and money and don't backup files ever.

I have genuinely never had an noticeable issue doing single-player questing, and I've done all of it as far as I know.  I've done far less PvP, but my experience is that it stays about the same as PvE until I get into a large scale battle; 20-30 people and it still feels playable, but it can get a bit rough beyond that amount, although not always.

elderscrollsonline,3docsk,Batchiii,3,Fri Jul 17 22:30:15 2015 UTC,Researching traits researches it on just that 1 item type. You get 9 traits per item type to research and each research doubles the amount of time it takes for the next trait to be researched on that item type. To research you need an item of that type that has that trait and it will destroy the item.

Reflective Scales and its morphs never had a projectile limit, only a time limit. As long as the DK flapped, he was immune to all incoming ranged damage. Inhale and its morphs did not have a cap to the number of enemies it can hit. This is especially useful with the Draw Essence morph where you can restore a bit of magicka for each enemy you hit with the skill.    EDIT: For those who don't play DKs, Inhale absorbs health from each (now currently 3) enemy.

Elusive Mist 75% damage Reduction + 70% movement Speed and it stacked with speed boosts such as Rapid Manoeuvre which would put them over 100% speed. Most enemy players couldn't even flee from a rampaging vampire let alone catch one. Undeath Passive 50% damage Reduction when health drops low. Vampire Ability Costs - At stage 4 their was a 75% reduction cost if I remember, much greater then the mere 21% reduction cost their is today, this included their ultimate and if they combined it with the Akaviri Dragonguard Set, many Vampires could reduce the cost of Devouring Swarm to only 4 which means they could spam the ultimate button, basically back then It looked like Dracula Untold whenever you encountered a vampire considering how many bats were flying everywhere, not to mention with devouring swarm these vampire's could tank 10 - 20 people at once and win and they were healing for at least 1000 health every second as they could stack their ultimate and spam it which compares today to about 10000 health per second while  at the same time dealing massive damage to everyone around them. Dark Stalker Less I recall it used to stack with a certain movement set allowing a vampire to sneak faster then a horse could gallop.   Its no secret the first ever Emperor in ESO was a Vampire, then they got overnerfed for a time and then buffed ever slightly to the vampire's of today.

elderscrollsonline,3do201,rolfmacchio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:18 2015 UTC,If you run with a two handed weapon you can use the brawler morph of cleave to add a damage shield or if you prefer dual wield it looks like twin slashes morphs to blood craze which heals you based of bleed damage done.   I'm not sure how it'll balance needing stam but you can always run 5 LT and 2 HVY  for armor to beef yourself up a bit. On my Templar that setup gives me plenty of magicka regen and I'm still durable enough to take some of the bigger hits.
elderscrollsonline,3do201,enzo2564,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"Wear two pieces of heavy armor (chest/legs) and then 5 light pieces. Slot bound armor or the lightning armor thingy that gives you a temporary armor/spell res buff a deals some weak AoE for X seconds. If you have a defensive skill on each bar, plus the extra two heavy pieces, you should be able to significantly increase your survivability without sacrificing your build. Also from heavy armor line the skill immovable is great for squishies. It costs stamina which saves your magicka for killing stuff, and gives you CC immunity (important in dungeons, crucial in PvP) for a short time while giving you a nice armor/spell res buff.   If you really want to ditch the skirt and staff and become a true front line warrior you can go two ways. 5 heavy/ 2 light armor setup with sword and shield on one bar and destro staff as your off hand. go two points health, one point magicka or 50/50 split while leveling. Unlock puncture for a taunt, go pure tank for PvE. Also, this makes you a tanky skirmisher for PvP (running a very similar build on my Templar with good success). The second option is to go crazy with it and rock a sorcerer stamina build. Pump all your attributes into stamina, rock a 2 hander and a bow, for your damage dealing you'll want to stick to the weapon skills (wrecking blow, snipe, volley, executioner, etc, etc) but you have a ton of magicka utility spells at your disposal. Slot a clannfear with a bow and make a ranger type build. put thunder armor guy on your 2h bar and be a lightning knight. Get crit surge and heal yourself for smacking noobs in the face with your giant, awesome sword.  FWIW, I'd personally go option one. Sorcerer has too many fun spells to go full stamina build. Plus I think sorcerer spells tend to be more costly than other classes, making your already gimped magicka bar on a stamina build really stressed. If you can make your own/have someone craft you Seducer armor set it helps to replace some of the regen and cost reduction you lose from having less light armor on."

If you gear your guild to the poor then don't expect it to grow that much or have the best guild trader locations. Successful guilds have money. It sucks that some people are poor, but they will make more money and to be honest it isn't that hard to make 20k if someone just goes stealing or raw mat collecting. I know where you are coming from and we thought about having a cap, but we decided it would be best for everyone in the guild if the guild was wealthy. If the guild is wealthy then the wealth can go down to the poor as well in ways other than raffles, but a poor guild can't do much of anything to help anyone except as an outlet for a nice community."

Also two out of the three trading guilds I'm in have minimum sales requirements to make sure the sellers are active. I have no clue what they are though, so I don't know what a fair amount would be.

elderscrollsonline,3djfhd,jtzako,10,Thu Jul 16 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"One thing a lot of people miss on leveling Werewolf is that it is kill based, not exp based for leveling the Werewolf (not the skills, just the  main 1-10 part).  You can actually stay inside the instance when you first do the werewolf quest, talk to the shrine afterwards but dont exit the zone. Just go ahead and turn into WW and start killing trash (it respawns).   The reason to do this as the WW timer isnt active in that zone and you can just keep going until you are ready to stop.  If you didnt do that, another fast way to level is find an area with a bunch of critter spawns (frogs, rabbits, monkeys, chickens etc) and kill them.  You still have your timer of course, but you can feed and keep active as long as you have spawns.  For the individual skills, it can take forever to level them.  I recommend filling up your secondary weapon hotbar with werewolf skills and switch to that hotbar when turning in quests or just before completing a dolmen etc."

elderscrollsonline,3djfhd,Ippildip,3,Fri Jul 17 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"I followed the ebonheart guide all the way to 50 in less than two weeks of casual playing. I'd gain 5 levels a day (1 per hour) with pure grinding while getting a ton of money, recipes, purps...etc. I also didnt play hardcore so someone who does could do it quicker. Heres what I did differently:  The guide shows you spots that are heavily populated with mobs that are clustered in two to threes. The best way to powerlevel is ungrouped whilst running a loop of the area with others. 2...3...4...10 it doesnt matter really, I think at like 15 ppl I started to see a decline but it was still worth all the items I'd get. Sometimes i had to be quick or else i wouldnt get any xp! Eventually ppl go away so it was all good. Anyways what you want to do is tag all the mobs before they die, or else you wont get xp. You should spec into an aoe build if you really want to grind to 50. Or at least have one aoe spell that you can spam nonstop. Thats about it. Stick with the group and run laps around the grind spot. Oh and also just hit the mobs enough to tag them, aka get loot and xp when they die, dont try and kill them yourself because then others may not have a chance to hit them as quickly. So hit them once or twice and keep running, not sprint, just run to the next mob spawn. You'll memorize them all quickly."

elderscrollsonline,3dn13e,Despair9,4,Fri Jul 17 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"I mean at least ESO has some endgame compared to other MMOs, GW2 is totally lacking in the ""Traditional Endgame"" for example. ESO's 2 of the 3 Trials are ridiculously easy, but at least they improved on the last one, which was a nightmare in the beggining. I think it literally took months for the first guild to complete it, before they nerfed it into oblivion.  However if you're looking into dungeons, I believe ESO has currently the hardest dungeons of any other MMO (on veteran difficulty of course), not to mention they also have the most beautiful layout + epic story tied to every single one of them (Which is not a big surprise, as there is no MMO better looking at the moment). If you try to PUG a Veteran Dungeon you'll fail in 99% cases, there is so many Boss mechanics that can 1-shoot you, even the Tanks are not immune to being 1-shoot if they are not careful.  Seriously I'm very happy with how ZOS is designing dungeons. We already have 16 Normal + 8 Veteran Dungeons (Veteran Dungeons have new bosses, new layout + continuation of the Story from the Normal Version). With Imperial City we're getting another 2 Normal Dungeons + 2 Veteran ones + 1 PvP Dungeon. That will be already 29 Dungeons in such a short period of time, hell even Vanilla WoW didn't have that many dungeons in it's entire duration."

DSA is often considered the ""next step"" after you have all the VR dungeons down pat.  Like all dungeons its a matter of good communication, experience and understanding your class and the classes of your group mates.  DSA does not scale, it is intended purely as an end game venture.

Make sure you're under the correct guild and just search (no need to apply any filters) and if you're under 50 members it should be the only thing to come up anyways.

elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,timedawn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I tried that but it simply won't hit that hard. I read that you can even do a weapon swap but that didnt work either.
elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,cdeghost,3,Fri Jul 17 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"Because you need endgame PVP gear, crafted gear and CP in the right area, etc to hit that hard.   It's a very glass cannon build that is dead in a matter of seconds if they can't stealth back up."

elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,cdeghost,2,Fri Jul 17 14:53:13 2015 UTC,Snipe doesn't always pull you out of stealth.  I've sniped and ambushed with both criting. I've also fired off 2 snipes that crit back to back.
elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,Pfoxinator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:54:44 2015 UTC,Hrm I have to try that but even if that happens from time to time he killed me like 5 times with the same combo. And only snipe and ambush killed me.
elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,zackryz,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:32 2015 UTC,Most likely from stealth and using the build/gear I described about
elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,Halfdaen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:20 2015 UTC,He's probably doing one of boosting crit or weapon damage to ridiculous levels to make it hit that hard.  Also could be drinking potions to boost crit or weapon damage.

elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,Baconfat79,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:48:35 2015 UTC,Block breaks the snipe. I tried the weapon swap but that only works after the animation is complete.
elderscrollsonline,3dmfel,Yonkit,6,Fri Jul 17 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"It works because snipe is in the air while he ambushes. Odds are, he's also getting empower. Theoretically, the order of events goes something like this:  Have Weapon damage buff up (rally, potion, whatever), and relentless assault up. Snipe and ambush are on the same bar.   Toggle magelight/whatever for empower Start snipe (queue up ambush) Snipe shoots (checks for stealth) Ambush starts casting Ambush hits (checks for stealth, gains stealth attack bonus, empower used, stealth drops) (gain empower again from ambush) Snipe hits (stealth bonus due to cast finishing while stealthed, empower used)   Done right, both attacks have stealth damage bonus and empower. You have to be near max ambush range for this to work, because you need snipe travel time.   Also, as far as gearing goes, if you don't have 5 weapon damage set bonuses and weapon damage enchants on jewelry...then you're not really trying."

elderscrollsonline,3dngqh,SoupOfSomeYoungGuy,0,Fri Jul 17 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"VR15 is the highest level.  Each step just uses the base material that is found in the zones of that level range.   On PC ( not sure if you're console or PC) the motifs, the PC races minus Imperial, usually ran 300-450 gold ish.  Armor styles are actually based on the racial material you use.

elderscrollsonline,3dngqh,Chalybos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"You playing on PC?  I'm going to make that assumption based on the GW2 reference.  Oh, and that's three questions. ;)  1)  Good prices are whatever the current market dictates.  There are a couple of add-ons for crafting and selling that will let you know what the average resale price on a particular item has been over the last two weeks, split between all of the guilds you are in.  On PC, blue motifs (the common ones, despite blue being the ""uncommon"" color) are worth between 250-300 gold each.  On XB1, apparently they're going for thousands each.  Then there are the purple motifs; they're rare.  The Dwemer books are 3-6,000 each, depending.  There are individual books for each type of gear, so there's a lot of the Dwemer ones.  The non-Dwemer purples go from 18-25,000, depending on the individual one you are looking at.  The gold, that's ultra-rare.  Imperial will set you back 50,000 gold on PC.  I shudder to think what it would be on console.  2)  Other armor styles like Daedric?  Still a racial style, just not a playable race.  Like Ancient Elf.  There are costumes, available on the crown (cash) store.  Also, certain costumes available after completing certain in-game milestones.  3)  Each armor has a ""look"" according to the style.  That ""look"" evolves as you level up and use different crafting materials, or different amounts of the materials.  Khajiit medium armor at the lower tiers looks like buckskin armor with crescent moons stitched in certain places.  As you level up, the look is more detailed, and looks ... beefier?  More solid.  That's the difference in appearance between different levels of the same type, same style gear.  Hope this helps."

Check medium armor passive abilities for higher critical hit ratings   Edit: Forgot to mention I'm using mainly Magicka, not much stamina atm. I was using 1 hand sword and shield for a little while but eventually changed to dual weild or destruction staff for primary bar and restoration staff for secondary.

I don't have any AoE attacks and it makes any crowd over 3 enemies seem near impossible. I also feel like I get killed within 3-4 hits from almost any enemy at or above my level. The only other styles of play I could think of for solo play would be a Sorcerer that has ""pets"" or a healing Templar. I'm just too lost lol"

As a NB you should do magicka or stamina and only pick abilities that match that.  Don't try to do everything, that's how you make weak characters.  Any important build related choice can be rebated to you for gold, allowing you to completely redo your character.  The only thing you can't change is your race and class."

It's all speculation but it seems ESO managed to keep 1.2mil subs on average as a P2P MMO based on SuperData Report last year. No reason why they shouldn't have more than 1mil active players as a B2P MMO now. Especially because that Report was also before the famous Update 6, hell even before Update 5 hit the PTS."

elderscrollsonline,3dn28h,Pfoxinator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Duels are still no from what I'm aware thankfully. They've mentioned battlegrounds and we may see some sort of arena style setup with the Imperial City.  You can do this now of a sorts by just doing resource point flipping.
elderscrollsonline,3dn28h,rolfmacchio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"Why thankfully?  I don't understand why people who don't want to duel don't want ANYONE to be able to do it.  It just sounds so petty.  They would almost certainly have an option to automatically reject duels, so you wouldn't even have to worry about getting constantly flooded with them.  I don't like zerg-fests or raids, but I don't want to see them taken or kept from people who do."

I hope you understand me being thankful they're not in is not synonymous with I don't want anyone to have them.   They would almost certainly have an option to automatically reject duels, so you wouldn't even have to worry about getting constantly flooded with them.   Pretty big assumption and as if it really matters. This isn't a point of concern.  Duels have always resulted in players thinking they can do class balance. While ESO's build is quite a bit different than others and I can't say how dueling would work out here, it's rarely resulted in good behavior.  It's also a pointless thing if Justice Part 2 makes it in.  So sure. Duel. Just note my player enforcer may misunderstand and off you both as a result. ;)"
elderscrollsonline,3dn28h,symphonicmetal9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:00:55 2015 UTC,Well you can understand my confusion with thinking that being thankful that something is not included in the game means that you don't want it to be there.

Basically reducing PvP to more of a spreadsheet than some people do now.  I hear what you're saying it would be fun to take on your friends or really prove who has the better build but you can't deny that some people would use it to get even better at making uber builds.  As it is now, testing a new build requires going out and facing random opposition.  The guesswork makes it fun."

Every once in a while you'll find Copper and Argentum. You can either keep 'em for crafting or sell them.

elderscrollsonline,3djllh,Chalybos,3,Fri Jul 17 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Not OP but  Fences are found in the Outlaws Refuge in each major city. In Vulkhel Guard where you should be now, the entrance is behind the Temple of Auri-El (opposite the bank). There's always two entrances to a Refuge, one inside and one outside, so if you have a bounty you can get in without having to go past guards - but I can't remember where the outside Vulkhel Guard entrance is.  When you're stealing stuff, you'll either steal your ""normal"" items - materials, weapons, food etc - or just what I call ""thieves items"". You'll know the difference; instead of telling you what an item does, it tells you a bit about it. E.g. ""Authentic Dragon Claw: This curved object is dark black and has a very sharp point. Rumored to be a dragon claw, its authenticity has not be verified."" (Got from here )  These ""thieves items"" vary in quality and price. White items get you 30g, Green gets you 100g, Blue gets you 250g (I've never stolen anything higher so don't know if they exist or what they're worth!) You can only sell stolen items at a fence and there is a limit to how many you can sell a day. You'll get a warning message when selling those Blue items but don't worry just sell 'em; that's just to make sure you don't accidentally sell a blue recipe or blue piece of armour to the fence.  If you steal something you want to sell at a guild store - say, a Blue recipe - then you'll need to launder it before you're allowed to put it up for sale. This is also done at the fence, just on a different tab. Laundering and I believe selling at a fence levels up your Legerdemain skill which allows you to put points into making your thieving career easier.   As a general criminal tip: before making a risky steal - for example, a lockbox where you don't have a lot of time before an NPC will see you - for heavens sake sell and launder your stuff first. Guards cannot be killed and will catch you, and they will not only take away the value of your bounty they will also take away all of your stolen items. The number of times I've had an inventory full of stolen goods taken away from me after a bad decision in front of guards...ah. It's heartbreaking lol.  Hope that helps :)"

It's incredibly frustrating when you are running into the same person over and over, and knowing that your fun has come to an end at the hand of their 500+ CP. (I know this because I asked him.) Even worse is the feeling that I, myself, need to spend my days grinding CP on my vet so that I can keep up and compete on my non-vets. I love Non-Vet PvP, what I don't love is being at a disadvantage just because I don't grind as much as the next guy.... The thing is, the idea behind the Battle-Leveling system is truly wonderful. Everyone is on an even playing field, leaving everything up to skill. However, the allowance of a veteran only system in a non-veteran server is creating massive imbalance."

elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,Halfdaen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"While BWB has a following, IMHO they shouldn't spend a lot of developer time on this, although I don't really care if they turn off CP in BWB  If they FIXED Vet PvP (I am aware that this is a complicated mess, considering zerg vs non-zerg, lag, objective weight, V14 balance, etc) then people wouldn't have to reroll every time they ""vetted"" out, because people would be happy playing their Vets  Also, the more popular BWB becomes, the more likely it is to inherit the problems that Vet PvP has. So again, FIXING VET PVP also helps BWB  Lastly, while CP imbalance is an issue, non-Vet PvP is horribly imbalanced from the level/preparation perspective, due to skills/passives. I'm sure plenty of the re-rollers wear all training gear while leveling up, and take themselves to L40+ so they can have all the skills they want. For example, Rally+max med armor passives is a much, much bigger advantage than 200 CP, compared to the noob who just quested his way to 40 in normal gear with a spread of skills (or, heh, a L15 who just got weapon swap). Then throw a focused build on top of that.  Even without CP, twinking for advantage is very much possible in BWB, it just involves abilities/passives/skillpoints more than gear/stats. Please don't go on about how even the playing field is. (this last bit isn't directed at you personally)"

I do think they should put some catch up mechanic for new players without alienating those that put a lot of time into the game to get where they are. Maybe a Tiered reduced xp schedule needed for cp for those under 100, then and there tier for those under 150. I think they tried to do that with diminishing returns on cp but there are those that play a lot. I consider myself a hardcore player and I have 260 cp, I also don't grind cp either because I hat it and it's boring.

elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,asb116,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:59 2015 UTC,Totally agree. No CP in BWB.
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,A_Dwemer_Construct,5,Thu Jul 16 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"As someone w/a substantial amount of CPs who occasionally plays BwB, I recognize your concern. A 200 cp difference in a 1v1 type encounter in non vet is almost insurmountable unless the lesser cp is very good or the higher cp just sucks. This is because gear is significantly less important compared to vet camps, so when there is a major difference in raw ability, CPs are likely to be the culprit. But just to add to your post, I think you missed the actual biggest problem with CPs in non vet.   The little buffs you get are great. No doubt. But, the real issue with CPs (in not vet) is the global boost to your resources. I may be mistaken, but I believe the increase to your resources functions on a logarithmic and not linear basis. That is to say, the higher your base total the higher the gains from having cp. When you combine this with the ridiculous battle scaling of BwB...you can see the problem. Ironically enough, x CPs in BwB yield significantly more of an advantage than x CPs in vet, because it factors the cp buff on top of the battle scaling. As a result, an imperial I run in BwB for example @lvl 40 (for the final tough passive) will have over 37k health. That's just stupid. That being said, I will unabashedly say that I will take advantage of this while I can because it's fun as fuck.   I agree with your conclusion however. But, I just hope that if ZoS grants you this, people will stop complaining about CPs in vet campaigns. Let non vet be an even playing field where only skill and build matter, let vet campaign be the free for all campaign where skill, build, AND progression matter. Everyone's happy. We can agree to this, yes?"
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,DoTheTankySpanky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"That's a great point and 100% agree. Resources I actually think are the biggest deal (reduced cost/regen), but it was more challenging to test. I used this simply as an example of how a simple change could make such a difference. I personally never run out of mana on my Bloodmage build in Blackwater because of my CP (I have under 200). I encourage you to make this post on the forums since ZOS is watching that and has commented."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,krakrox,-3,Thu Jul 16 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the complaining will stop. Nor do I think everyone will be happy.  In your mind I should never be able to PvP in Vet Cyro, because I will always be a hell of a lot less powerful than the no-lifers. (Been playing since Beta, still don't even have 30 CPs). While I agree that those who put their entire lives into the game should be SLIGHTLY more powerful than an equal level/geared character, the CP system as it stands is just ridiculous until everyone manages to get enough CP's to limit the power gap with the CP systems diminishing returns.  It's fine to have an advantage, it's not ok to have essentially a 'god mode' in PvP.  To me it's all moot, I don't PvP so don't much care what happens with it, I just don't think having an insane power gap between max level characters is healthy for PvP.... Eventually everyone that isn't a totally hardcore player will get sick of being insta-killed and doing no damage. I know I would."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,DoTheTankySpanky,5,Thu Jul 16 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"Please don't speak for me, you don't know what's 'in my mind'. But let me just tell you straight up, just because you can't 1v1 someone with 10x the time and effort invested into the game DOES NOT mean you cant play vet cyro. The problem with you griefers is that you blow things wayyyy out of proportion. The god mode you describe is only apt for people w/ close to/over 1000 CPs. And they constitute maybe a tenth of 1% of the player base.   Your logic is rife with fear mongering and slippery slopes. And quite frankly it's toxic for our community because it leaves a false impression on the minds of newer players who read your reactionary comments and think vet campaign is actually unplayable. ""A fractional minority are OP, therefore I can't play vet campaign cus those big bad no lifers exist somewhere out there"". Really? Hearing this makes me think you haven't actually played much vet pvp at all. Cus if you did, you'd realize how for every OP as fuck cp monster, there are probably 100 'regular' players who have very reasonable capabilities.   You say a lot of things, but all I can hear is ""I want to be competetive without putting in the work to be competetive."" And FYI, if you had a realistic grasp of the current meta, you'd realize it doesn't take hundreds of cp to be competetive. Just a hundred will hold you over fine."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,krakrox,3,Thu Jul 16 18:34:30 2015 UTC,ZoS has a plan to balance CP in Vet ... but these new players just coming into PvP are going to get turned off so much by these players that are doing more damage than they will be able to do in Non-vet against them.

elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,TheAmorphous,4,Thu Jul 16 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that knowing your build is extremely important, but newer players don't deserve to be melted by people with CP. With pure skill and builds, you can bridge the gap, but not with CP included."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,Dimasterua,3,Thu Jul 16 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I definately agree that CP alone doesn't mean success in a duel- but keep in mind, that's only CP at it's current state. I worry about the future of the campaign as CP begins to go above 500. Even if it's not the only imbalance issue, getting rid of it can only do good for a campaign that's famous for being somewhat balanced in the first place."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,TheAmorphous,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:08 2015 UTC,Fair enough. In an AvA scenario we are given the tools to deal with strong players though.

In PvE, it allows you to create stronger characters right off the bat so that you don't have to struggle through a boring campaign again if you're creating another toon in the same faction, for example. It also rewards players who play for a long time across multiple characters, so every toon doesn't turn into yet another grind until you hit Vet ranks."

I already have a Vet 3 NB, but I wanted something else to switch it up in case I got bored. So I made a Sorc, and as soon as I got in the game, I remembered how boring the first 40 or so levels were in terms of just repeating quests where the objective was ""go here, kill this, come back, go there, kill this bigger thing, come back, done"". The champion points that I had from my NB made this grind just a bit easier though, at least in PvE. So I don't think they should be removed for new toons specifically in PvE. You say that those levels go by quickly, but for me they're a pain in the ass, so I appreciate knowing that, when I play my main, it's also helping out my toons as well. I hope that makes sense..."

I don't really see myself ever hitting VR14, so hopefully the CP thing in BWB never becomes a big enough problem that it seriously detracts from my enjoyment. I'm fine with the people who really sink time into a game having an advantage over the casuls, but surely it's enough to have that in Vet PvP and leave non-vet PvP low-investment with low-reward (other than fun).

elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,jaaf,0,Fri Jul 17 01:43:34 2015 UTC,I don't want to go back to the days where there were too many campaigns for the population so they became emp farming ones. I understand what you're saying but that's what a nerf is all about. Plenty of my favourite builds and abilities were nerfed and I had to have a few weeks to get used to a new playstyle- but it worked out in the end.
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,nastylep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:04:53 2015 UTC,But this wouldn't be a one and done nerf....  It would happen every time you go from PvE to pvp.   If it was one and done it's like a bandage but this would be like picking the scab of a wound anytime one forms ya know?
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,jaaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:08:22 2015 UTC,"Non-Vet should be no-CP, no-emp.  Non-vet should be the area where PvP is most fair and in the end, meaningless, so that leveling players can understand the mechanics but still have reason to level and PvP at max level.  It should not be ESO ""Twinkville"", but unfortunately, since ZOS has demonstrated that they utterly fail at PvP balance in every aspect, this likely will not change, and be dismissed.  Even before CP was introduced, BwB was still a fairer assessment of PvP class balance then vet campaigns... which should have been the first warning sign that something wasn't right.  EDIT: Good job on the testing btw."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,DoTheTankySpanky,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"I won't go as far as 'no-emp', but no CP is good. No-emp would lead to AP farming. Emperorship in BwB is actually hard to get, and we don't farm it."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,nastylep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"No-emp would lead to AP farming.   This happens anyways, in all campaigns.  People aren't really PvP'ing for objectives... they just want to PK.  It's why arenas and duels are requested so much.  You would think that if the PvP was more balanced, people would give 2 shits about BwB emp.  Except every day its like a new forum post about someone getting BwB, whereas no one gives a hoot about the emp in vet campaigns, which should be the campaigns that require the most skill...   Emperorship in BwB is actually hard to get, and we don't farm it.   This isn't always true.  I know of a decent amount of players that played only in BwB to farm and get emp because it was easier then vet level for their classes/situation.  Much easier for a level 47 with tons of CP to get AP and Emp against average player level of 25 in BwB."

Gotta expect a decently strong correlation between time invested and power"
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,nastylep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think what makes it different in Blackwater Blade is that battle levelling creates an expectation that level advantages are disabled. So prior to the champion system two level 10 characters were roughly equivalent stat-wise regardless of who had more VR14 slots. After the champion system I can come in to Blackwater with almost 20k spell resistance, against a fresh player that has the battle level minimum (~8k). That just shouldn't be possible in a campaign where there isn't supposed to be level advantages."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,DoTheTankySpanky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"How many CP's does that 20k spell resist require you to have earned?   With the example OP provided with 93 points into Spell Erosion giving his Lava Whip an extra 122 damage per hit, this seems incredibly overblown."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,ghostsnstuffz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:03:47 2015 UTC,"I invite you to test the actual difference with more than just whip. When you actually experience CP imbalances in non-vet, you'll understand what OP means.  The largest difference was... again.. 183."

elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,DoTheTankySpanky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that these bonuses add up. OP's example of 93 points into spell erosion is just to show how far you can go with it, but realistically most people don't spend their points like that due to the drastic diminishing returns you start to experience in each champion bonus. Most people take a more breadth-first approach to allocation which is where you really start to see the balance problems. So they might have 20% spell resistance AND 20% block cost reduction AND 20% erosion AND 20% magic damage, etc, etc. Cumulatively these bonuses create a pretty insurmountable power gap between someone with several hundred champion points and someone with zero."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,ghostsnstuffz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"If we want to add on damage buffs like that from the same tree, we'd be getting into territory where the guy in question would have to have well over 500 CPs, no?   Again, I have no problem with some one like this having an advantage. Looks like we might just have to agree to disagree, though."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,Tx12001,2,Thu Jul 16 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"450 total for that example. That's definitely not an outlier number. There are already people with 1000. I don't have a problem with this outside of Blackwater (assuming a catch up mechanism is implemented as planned for people below some threshold of total CP), but in non-veteran it just unnecessarily exacerbates the twinking problem and makes new players less likely to enjoy PvP in a campaign that's supposed to get them into it."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,RiohtGaming,0,Thu Jul 16 16:49:21 2015 UTC,The issue is that the campaign's purpose was to just be for non-vet players. Yet they can bring vet bonuses like CP to PvP which makes absoloutley no sense.
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,sargeant_pig,0,Thu Jul 16 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between gearing a toon for something, which is 100% possible in Blackwater, and having an edge over someone who can never fight it in that situation.   Non-vet players CANNOT obtain CP and it's absolutely unfair for them to be subjected to the effects that it has with no way to counter it. You failed to see the point."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,RiohtGaming,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between gearing a toon for something, which is 100% possible in Blackwater, and having an edge over someone who can never fight it in that situation.   IIRC, it was neigh impossible to gear a level 19 to a level where he could compete with the roflstomping twinks unless you had a max level character. The premium level 19 items were inflated to absurd prices.  But regardless, it still ends up at the same result. The veteran players will have an advantage.  I still think you're overblowing the fact that a guy who has earned 300+ CP's does an extra 122 damage per lava whip."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,CloaknPoke,0,Thu Jul 16 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"I've killed geared players while my toon was naked. Gear only ASSISTS, it doesn't give you an advantage like CP does.   And it's a 183 damage difference per whip, which can be increased by a large degree if the player also stacks into Thaumaturge. You still miss the point. These players CANNOT bridge this gap with skill alone. Sets may give you a slight increase to crit or a reduction to magicka cost, but CP can give more than both of those two 5pc sets without even breaking 200cp.  It's a clear disadvantage to the newer players. They will never be able to achieve the same damage or mitigation of players with CP while they still lack veteran characters, which is a gross imbalance and should be addressed.  Sets are not the problem. They never were. It's a CP issue."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,THESHIV,0,Thu Jul 16 16:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think you may have mislabeled your pictures.   The link below test 2, which you label as ""concerning"", links to the pic of you doing 1775 damage per hit. 122 more damage than test 1.  The link below test 3, which you label as ""moderate"", links to the pic of you doing 1836 damage per hit. 183 more than test 1.   But I fully understand your point. You don't want champion points to persist in non-vet campaigns.   My point is that some one who has invested countless hours into the game can do an extra 183 damage per lava whip than a brand new player who may have just installed the game two hours prior.   I have 0 problems with this."
elderscrollsonline,3dijhc,lydleera,0,Thu Jul 16 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"It's not just Lava whip, man. It's every ability doing more damage. They can do it for longer, they can resist significantly more damage, and they can break out of much more CC.   You're saying that new players should just accept that they're always going to be under the other players. This is an MMO, not a damned RPG. Balance is necessary for its survival and your inability to see that is both disturbing and upsetting.  CP may not make a player, but it gives an absolutely unfair advantage over players in that campaign. A campaign made for those players. Why players like you believe that new players should be at a disadvantage other than their lack of skill is absolutely beyond me."

elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,TisteAndii,3,Fri Jul 17 04:00:03 2015 UTC,Use a sword. Dual wield. Heavy armor. Put your points in stamina. You can even keep the summons.   Infinite combinations for any class.
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,grnzftw,2,Fri Jul 17 04:17:15 2015 UTC,"Hey tiste,  Just so you know you can play any class any way you wish. And if you want to play an passive dps/AoE then your playing the right class just maybe not the right skills.   Between the storm calling tree and the destro staff even the dark magic tree. You have AoE for days. If you haven't already give some of the other skills a try.   If you are for sure looking to change here is a little bit of info for you to think about.    DK- plays best as a tank or dps. As a tank it has great CC for groups and can hold its own against bosses. As a dps it has really high magicka focus on fire damage or you can go with a melee stamina and knock some lights out. With a great self heal and good internal buffs it makes a great solo character but can be a team player in any group setting. NB- (my personal favorite) super good single target dps and great support abilities. As a dps you can quickly nuke down enemies wish single target buffs and debuff along with damage bonuses out the wazoo. As a support you can run a healer or a CC support role with the syphoning tree. Works great with weapon sets for stamina builds and can wreck face regularly.  Temp- the jack of all trades class that can do it all good. Best healer in the game overall because of the build in skill tree. As a tank it does well with survival and using AoE to maintain aggro. It is very good as a dps weather it be ranged or melee stamina or magicka. It really can go any way you want it to.    I hope that you take some time to try some other build concepts for the sorc before moving on because the game really does give you a thousand and 1 options. I have played in a group with 3 sorcs all doing different builds. A tank with the shield buffs an AoE with storm calling and a summoner with healing. Try out some new stuff and ask around for more info. But the list about should help with making a decision on next character."
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,willow1771,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:57:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll test out some other abilities. Right now I'm using Magelight, both Summons, Overload Ultimate, Daedric Shards, and Force Clench. I'll give some other abilities a try."

So I made my sorcerer a Stamina Sorcerer! I use Bound Armor, Critical Surge along with 2H Crit Rush and it wrecks face pretty hard, the sorcerer has so many weapon buffs it's crazy, that and bound armor makes it look like you're wearing Daedric Armor all the time and it's gorgeous. For dungeons I use my summoned pets to tank for me while I smack the enemies around with my sword. It's a pretty fun build!"
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,araLetot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:39:46 2015 UTC,Just picked up ESO and the 2h play style you mentioned is exactly how I want to play.  Which race are you for your stamina sorc build?  I'm torn between making a Wood Elf or High Elf.  Or is there another race that you would recommend?  I guess I want to make a battle mage?  I want the ability to soak up damage with heavy armor while using my spells and 2h abilities.  The knock down of crystal shards and uppercut seem really awesome for pvp.  Any suggestions?
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,call_me_cliff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"I went with a dark elf because it's kind of a middle ground class that also has good fire resistance (since I plan on making him a vampire for the magic/Stam regen, 10% each). I'm loading all my stats into stamina, the spells are really just for armor, Crit bonuses, and pets for dungeons.   So my damage output is more based off my weapons while my CC and buffs are from the spells. I hardly run out of magicka as long as I put my shield/buff/pets on before I enter the fight. Stamina I have for days. The bound armor ability (from Daedric summoning tree) has a stamina morph that is awesome! And you get to walk around in permanent Daedric Armor until you toggle the spell off ha."
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,araLetot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:39:37 2015 UTC,I did some digging around and I found a build called the Ricochet Sorcerer by Deltia.  It mentions using three 2h abilities mixed with a bow.  The guide only goes up to level 25 though.  Are you using your ESO knowledge or are you following a guide?
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,call_me_cliff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"Little bit of both, I've seen the ricochet build and it's mainly focused around 2H whereas I want to use DW, I've been trying 2H for grinding mobs (I'm lvl 40 now) and it is not nearly as effective as DW in terms of clearing both large groups and single targets. Which is surprising because I though the Crit build would be stronger on the 2H. I think it's because with DW I get crits more often just from the higher attack speed. With Crit Surge more crits means more health regen so I can sit in the middle of 10 enemies and use steel tornado and never die, sort of like bat swarm."
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,araLetot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:04 2015 UTC,Are you on PS4?  What are you running as your secondary weapon?  The Ricochet build didn't seem to have many Sorcerer spells. How much CC do you have with DW?
elderscrollsonline,3dl5w5,call_me_cliff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Yep I'm on PS4  For my secondary I've been running 2H just to try it out and level it up to momentum for the heal but like I said my clears are much slower, I'm probably going to go to DW on both bars and use my Clanfear as my heal. Or just a random resto staff for a heal as well. Heals are slim for a sorcerer, it's mainly shields I need to keep up.   For my CC I have a couple options, crystal fragments for a single target stun, pets for distraction, and for mobs I use Encase since it's an AoE snare. It keeps them close to me while I go all whirlybird on them with steel tornado. Melts most mobs pretty fast and I get the heal from Crit surge while I spin."

elderscrollsonline,3dlnh7,Zyras_Bush,4,Fri Jul 17 07:21:48 2015 UTC,"The vet dungeons are a whole different level of difficulty compared to the normal dungeons.  Even though the baddies scale up these dungeons are much easier with 4 v14's then with 4 v1's. At the lower vet levels most people are still figuring out and trying to optimize their build, haven't maxed out their armor, and have not run the dungeons enough to know the boss mechanics.  Couple of suggestions.  First, be nice (and i'm not implying that you're not). When your group wipes don't point fingers (unless it's a v14 sorc tank wearing light armor with 17k health who is using his pets to aggro and a two-handed sword as a weapon). THEN you can point fingers.  But I digress. You are always going to have someone who ""rage quits"". Don't be that person. Anytime your group wipes get together with your group and try to figure out what went right, what went wrong, what each member should or should not be doing.  Second, do some research. Get on Google or Youtube and try to get a feel of how to approach each boss. Is it a ranged fight, a melee fight, a dps race, a healer check, etc.  Lastly, join a guild that is geared toward running end game content. There should be people there who are willing to run the vet dungeons with lower level vets."

Going with 5 light, 2 heavy (legs and chest) has worked out quite well. I stay with that mix until my toon is leveled up into the late 40's or even into the early vet levels.

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,Corn_Cob_Pipe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Why is it harder after VR1? I thought it would be easier? Last night was my first experience (18 Altmer Sorc), and it was a blast. 3 friends and I (43, 38 and 25) all joined and soon found ourself in a 20 man group, part of a larger group going from castle to castle destroying the blues mostly. Anyways, long story short, i died a few times, killed a few guards and 1 player, and after I got 3 armor upgrades! It was a blast. I dont recommend going alone though, or if you do, stay with your own groups. You wont be storming a castle alone very long!  Edit: I forgot to add that you can still quest there without killing any player, and discover stuff, forage and what not as well. Its a huge continent and it was much better than i expected."
elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,x0diak,2,Thu Jul 16 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"When you're in Cyrodil at lvl 1-49, you gain certain buffs to make you ""in line"" with VR5 players. So, if you look at your stats and at those of your friends', you will all have about 1500 weapon dmg, 15k magicka and stamina, and 25k health regardless of where you put your attribute points.   When you turn Vet, these buffs are lost and your attribute distribution and weapon and armor stats start to matter. (For example, when I turned Vet, i had all of my points into Stamina, but I still only had 8k Magicka, 16k stamina, and 15k health. Notice how my health fell by like 10k. That's a big deal. I also had a greatsword that only did about 1k damage unbuffed. That's 500 less damage than a lvl 49 would be doing). However, when you're VR1, you don't have any good gear to support your weak points, so you have worse stats, but also less support, and probably less weapon damage. So, a VR is technically weaker than a lvl 49 player until he gets good level gear (specifically armor sets which give extra passives), weapons with more weapon damage, and passives from the champion point tree. Hopefully that makes sense :)"

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,x0diak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Ok question: how would I survive long enough to get veteran gear if people are going to roflstomp me? Are there pve quests that give vet gear, or is it all pvp based?"
elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,Dimasterua,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"No you can definitely find gear in PvE when you move on to Cadwell's silver and gold. In those areas, all the gear that drops is Vet levels. Also, you can still craft some really good gear - some crafted gear, like the Hunding's Rage set for Stam Nightblades, is even better than most PvP gear."

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,Thaihoax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:08:33 2015 UTC,You lose the veteran buff you get as a level 10-49 so you go from having roughly 25k hp to having 12k. Basically you die in half the time it used to take you.

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,boniggy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"I've played WoW for 7+ years and it's kinda hard to get off WoW when you've put so much time into it. I mean don't get me wrong BC era was pretty good (though still not even close to ESO quality). However once I grew up, I accepted that WoW is the best ""entry"" into  the MMO genre and well out of the sudden it felt and looked like a game made for kids. I'm glad ZOS went with way more ""mature"" and ""dark"" approach into ESO, or I'd be done with MMOs for good."

After playing other MMOs for years, it's still ""Go to B, speak with X. Go back to A.

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,cyberkitten,4,Thu Jul 16 11:11:52 2015 UTC,"Try getting some immersion addons. ""Dominoid's immersive things"" is a good start. It blacks out the NPC quest dialog text so you actually have to pay attention. There's also an ""explore in first, fight in third"" option that takes you (very smoothly) between first person when running about and 3rd person when fighting. There's another great addon for your quest journal which makes it much more skyrim-y. It makes it less about ""go here get that"" and more like ""solve this problem""."

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,cyberkitten,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I know how you feel about being burnt out on MMOs but I got more tired of tab target ones. But still this game was meant to be a MMO first as to keep people playing for a long time. Longer than any TES game. If it was more towards a single player TES game people would get their 1500hrs or whatever they max out on a TES game and be done. I can easily see people beat those numbers for a MMO in a TES atmosphere.

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,cyberkitten,3,Thu Jul 16 14:29:28 2015 UTC,Getting to level 6 is what 1 hour?  Why did you bother playing ESO (an MMO) if you're not willing to spend at least 20+ hours to test it out? Finishing the first Zone should be enough to know if you like it or not.

elderscrollsonline,3dh2vq,NillsKnillz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:04 2015 UTC,Thing is lvl 6-8 is such a bitch for leveling as you're weak as fuck and quests take forever with small amounts of xp. It gets better but you need to get past that level gap to have fun.

Still can't understand the hate ESO gets from so many people, most of them haven't even played the game but gonna hate it for no reason at all :(  I do love this game, too. This is exactly how I imaged a TES MMO ^ You got every freedom you want, even changing to whatever weapon you like at any time or respec to create a whole new class. At first I though NBs based on magicka with resto staff are crazy (om the contrary now, they are awesome!). You don't get the feeling ""oh I,ve done everything wrong since character creation"" because you can change most of your equipment and skills as you want.

A couple hours or so later I fell asleep and may have moved the camera a couple times during this slumber out of habit. At some point I was half waken up by the game, hearing what must have been my character being mauled by another vampire. After the incident I quickly fell back asleep.

Yes, the daily recipies for the writs actually come from a pre-defined pool of about 3 different options, depending on the level of your provisioning.  At max level you'll get the same 3 writs, they just alternate each day.   Arenthian Brandy Sipping Imga Tonic Khenarthi’s Wings Chai Pickled Carrot Slurry Argonian Saddle-Cured Rabbit Fresh Apples and Eidar Cheese   Find those 6 recipies.  It looks like it's the same for everyone at top level.  You can pre-make those and leave them in your bank.  When you get your daily writ you just withdraw the ones you need and hand them in.  Yes, you can 'pre make' these and store them in the bank, it still counts.  It even counts if they're made by other players too.  If you're not 50 yet in provisioning, just power level it asap and save yourself the hassle of trying to work out lower level provisioning daily writs, it's not worth the hassle to bother with it.  With the new XP potions coming to console soon, you can only get the recipie fragments from Level 50 writs, so you want to push through asap and hit top tier.  The 6 recipies I've listed above are a pain to find, but remember you only need to find them once.  If you need more help, click here  If you have multiple characters for provisioning, you can just withdraw these from your bank for the daily hand in on every character you have, even if they don't actually know the recipe, as long as they're level 50 provisioning.

elderscrollsonline,3dlgn1,asteldian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:12:37 2015 UTC,"When they say useless I think they mean slightly less powerful if you want to be min/max at something. The reason they say that is because the races with the increase Max Magicka and Stamina (and Health) are seen as good whereas others like the Argonian swim speed are less useful to a min/max type of player wanting to have the best stats.  Bosmer was changed and now gives heaps more Stamina Regen (21%) and some of the others are being tweaked in Update 7. Like Orc, Nord and Argonian (see here)."
elderscrollsonline,3dlgn1,MosDeAtmo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:18:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll definitely agree with you. They are addressing it to some extent. Though, I really question the utility of that Argonian. I'm just trying to understand why people harp on specific races for being obsolete right now."
elderscrollsonline,3dlgn1,A_Dwemer_Construct,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:16:51 2015 UTC,"The people who say race is the end all be all most important factor are WRONG. The people who say race is a non issue and a minimal factor are WRONG. The truth is somewhere in the middle. See, race gives unique passives which are impossible to recreate or imitate otherwise. As such, certain races gives a certain advantage over others when it comes to playing certain roles. While you can play any class as any race and work the passives to your advantage, all else held equal, certain races will perform certain roles better than other races every single time. Bare in mind that the following is merely my opinion, and it is a debated topic. However, I can back up and provide arguments on request for anything I say.  So when it comes down to it, every role and class will break into one of two categories: magicka and stamina. As such, I'll share my view in the best races for each category.   For stamina, the top dogs are Redguard and imperial. One has more sustain one has more tankiness. Wood elf is an honorable mention, with incredible Stam regen. However, they don't get the 10% flat stamina increase like the other two and on the whole the passives are a bit weaker IMO. So for stamina dps or tank, Redguard or Imperial are the top tier.   For magicka users, High Elf and Breton can't be beat. High elf will have more raw stats and do more damage, Breton has better magicka sustain. An honorable mention is Dark Elf which while it has good magicka passives, they aren't quite as good as Breton or High elf for pure magicka builds. Only exception is when it comes to fire dk , on which case dunmer is hands down the best choice.   So to recap, in my view, the best races are Imperial, redguard, high elf, Breton, and dark elf for fire dk."

Robust is a horrible trait.  Khhajit are a poor mans bosmer.  Not terrible but just worse than the alternative.  The ""wrong"" choice won't spot you from completing any content, but it can be a mild handicap"
elderscrollsonline,3dlgn1,LastReach,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"There are no useless races. In endgame the difference will be minimal most of the time. Some are a bit more handy than others with certain classes i.e Dark Elf Sorcerer, Redguard NB, etc etc"
elderscrollsonline,3dlgn1,magicpies,2,Fri Jul 17 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think Dark Elves make far better Dragonknights than sorcerers due to the bonus fire damage. If anything, I would say High Elf makes the best sorcerer due to bonus to all elemental damage and extra magicka."

elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,TURD_F3RGUSON,3,Thu Jul 16 13:32:04 2015 UTC,I'm an Orc Templar tank. Not squishy at all.
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,razenmaeher,2,Thu Jul 16 12:20:14 2015 UTC,Hey me too :D it works quite well. If you ask me the only place where another class outshines templar tanking is the pull from the chain skill of the dk. Now the temp has ways to neglect that disadvantage. I often run a heal tank build for pledges with 3 DPS. Also repentance and shards gives resources back to teammates. We may not have an HP scaled heal but we have an HP scaled shield. Also we have really nice damage mitigating ults for the whole team. Now this is not to say dk tanks are worse because after all they have battle roar to sustain. But the temp tank is awesome for when your healer has died or if you rather support tank than tank selfishly.
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,SushiJesus,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Me too.  I run an Orc Templar Tank with a splash of healing and it's awesome, we do our dungeons with a full time Templar Healer and if he drops having access to additional healing is invaluable.

elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,asteldian,0,Thu Jul 16 14:42:07 2015 UTC,PC has damage meters and addons that highlight min/maxing your damage/healing/tanking ability. Console does not so theres a more relaxed vibe.
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Meefury,3,Thu Jul 16 16:30:22 2015 UTC,Ohhhhh okay I got ya. That's actually one of the reasons why I'm considering switching over to pc.
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,razenmaeher,5,Thu Jul 16 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Templar tanks are best as AOE, Trash, Multi-boss (with a solid healer), or offtank/melee dps.  It was said already that DK tanks do better against big baddies because of mitigation, whereas Templars are better at supporting while tanking.  If you have a well rounded group, Templar tanks shine.  If you have a wishy-washy group, DK tank will hold up better.  Templar = Reactive tank  DK = Proactive tank"
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Kuratius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I consider it the opposite - DK trumps for trash thanks to their various utility skills. With a wishy washy group the Templar tends to be able to keep the fools alive and well whereas the DK can only watch in frustrations as they kill themselves.    When it comes to single boss fights, the Templar is ridiculously powerful, with 12k Damage shield, Aedric Spear passives, a cheap Ultimate for 15% damage reduction (admittedly rarely bother slotting that) and also BoL if you want it top up health after a big hit (though with healers in Trials it is not really needed) the Templar shines against one mob."
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,The_Kaizz,2,Fri Jul 17 08:24:27 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, since we're on this topic. May I ask as a Tank/Healer, is it advisable to add some points to my Magicka? Will it ruin my chances of surviving and cruising through Vet Dungeons when I'm in VR? I'm 35 now and I've pumped all into Health for now. Unsure if I should a few (or none at all) into Magicka"
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Kuratius,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:25 2015 UTC,Are you finding yourself running out of magicka?

Spread out your points evenly. I have  about 30 into HP and the rest into magicka. At your lvl with out cp it will be hard. Good luck
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Ubiquitous_Cacophony,4,Thu Jul 16 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"Templars are actually the best tanks in the game in terms of survivability. DKs just have better utility skills like chains, talons, etc."
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,NoaPsy,10,Thu Jul 16 12:30:43 2015 UTC,"DK's are superb for tanking if you like mitigation tanking, with skills tailored for taking huge hits and shrugging them off more easily. Templars are great tanks as well, but they rely more on self healing bigger hits, and have much less group utility. Every class has skills they can use for all the roles, but I'd say DK's are by far the best for endgame."
elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Ubiquitous_Cacophony,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you build your tank, but the survivability of a Templar tank against any un-cc-able enemies trumps that of DKs, mostly due to blazing shield and mitigation passives associated with aedric spear.  Non-boss tanking is a whole different ball game though, I can agree on that."

elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Tx12001,5,Thu Jul 16 14:42:20 2015 UTC,"Caltrops, blazing spears, or similar AOE attacks help. They're huge aggro generators. Honestly, though, the need to hold huge mobs is much lower than in other games."

elderscrollsonline,3dhtaq,Chromozon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"Oi. I'd warn against that at higher levels unless you spec your gear out in a lot of health enchantments. I prefer to have a high magicka regen and stack almost everything else into health (to the tune of 45 points of the 50). Especially with the way things like burning shield work (creating a damage shield based on health), it's pretty vital. If you want more damage, spread it around of course, but you won't be able to tank those big hits late-game without a lot of food otherwise."

elderscrollsonline,3dil6u,Po_Tae_Toes,4,Thu Jul 16 17:48:35 2015 UTC,There's a light armor passive that you can only use if you have 5 pieces of light armor equipped. Since you're a sorcerer it would probably be best to focus on boosting your magic.

elderscrollsonline,3dka65,jtzako,6,Thu Jul 16 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"It is actually an exceptional game in terms of game play experience and content. The negative reviews are almost all from the launch week and those issues have been corrected.  Pros: It is amazing and you will love every minute of it if you liked any Elder scroll game or MMO game. Since paying to play is not necessary in any way and even the things you can buy from the Crown Store are not game breaking in any manner. Your $60.00 initial cost for the game will lead to hundreds of hours of fun and enjoyment. Not many other games can keep up that pace.  Cons: You will want to dedicate all your time to it.

If you want a global auction house there is not one in ESO (this could be a pro or a con depending on what you like). No AddOns on console if you want to see your damage numbers or other battle numbers (again this could be a pro or con depending on what you like). It can be laggy in PVP sometimes, but this is being worked on and is in most MMO.

But yeah, it is very similar to alchemy in some ways.  FWIW, desconstructing Glyphs also gives exp to level Enchanting. If you decon looted glyphs and ones crafted by players other than you, it gives more exp than if you decon ones you craft yourself.  1) There are lots of options and probably not a true 'best'.  As long as you're boosting your magicka stat as much as you can, you'll do more damage.  2) PvP isnt required.  Some folks like it, but the majority of people who play ESO do not do PvP and they can enjoy the entire PvE game just fine.  3) Crowns dont go away unless you spend them.  You get additional  crowns for each month you are subbed.  4) VR are basically the same as a normal level, they just take much longer to obtain.  Instead of multiple levels per zone its more like 1 level per zone.  You go through the other 2 faction zones and quests along the way up the VR ranks."

elderscrollsonline,3djn0f,Shinni42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"I subbed to a month of ESO plus, if I don't use the crown allotment do I still get to keep them? Do they stack if I sub for another month?    Yes, you'll keep the crowns until you spend them.   Can someone explain the Veteran system to me? Is that like hitting level 50 and starting over again?    When you hit lv 50 you become VR 1. These go upto VR 14 and one VR needs currently 1mil exp and is approximately equivalent to 10 normal levels. How you gain the experience is up to you: pvp, dungeons etc, but you can also do cadwell's silver/cadwell's gold after you finished the main storyline. In cadwell's silver/gold you play the story of the other factions. It's a bit like starting over but with an already developed character and upscaled content.  Once you are VR 1, you can also gain champion points which are account wide. With these points you can unlock passives, a bit like in skyrims perk system. Every 400k exp you get a champion point, unless you are enlightened in which case you only need 100k exp. Every 24h you get enough enlightenment to get one champion point at the reduced rate of 100k exp. This bonus stacks for upto 12 days if you don't use it."

Oh, and Streak so you can run like a coward. Not required, but the Assault and Support skill lines contain some nifty skills, like Magicka Detonation and its morphs. These skill lines can only be leveled up through (lots and lots of) PvP. Also, I believe the VR14 versions of the Martial Knowledge armor set can only be found in treasure chests within Cyrodiil, although that doesn't necessarily require engagement with enemy players. Yes and yes, as far as I know. They are just levels that take ~10X as long to level up. At least they used to be. Zeni has boosted xp rewards to shorten that time."

Bolt Escape (I like the Streak morph) and Conjured Ward (Hardened Ward) for defense. 2) No, but it's wicked fun. 4) Veteran is just more levels, they take a lot more XP but they are more or less just like levels 1-50.  You get a stat point and they are a requirement to equip better gear.  Champion Points in veteran levels is where your progression changes at this point and becomes more diverse and interesting. 5) Consider getting a better girlfriend, I mean this game is awesome but come on man."

It's a cycle that gives you the feeling of advancement when really, you do the same thing you always have just better than 15 minutes ago.  Although, after grinding through levels, quests and finding new stuff, you can put your abilities to the test in PVP or PVE trials with 11 other allies. This is ""end-game"" stuff (although PVP can be done any time after level 10. Trials are true end-game). The story in this game is fairly bare and probably was rushed. The core of the gameplay is fighting, PVP and team dungeon delving.  If the above does not suit you, this game simply is not for you."

elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,Fayettevillan,3,Thu Jul 16 11:02:06 2015 UTC,"I would like suggestions on how to get the most out of attribute points.  I have been to several sites about builds but i really want more info on attribute points.  Im currently  veteran rank 3 and have little to no problem handling myself in veteran dungeons save for when I am the highest lvl in the group and the leader.   My current points are spread evenly between health and stamina.  A few builds suggest putting all attributes points in one place and compensating for the lacking ones with armor enchant.  Example:   I am a Dual weild/Bow Nightblade, stamina based.  So I'm placing every single attribute point in stamina and making up for the lack of health by enchanting all armor with health glyphs.  At veteran rank 3 that leaves me with about 11.5k health and 17.5k stamina unbuffed(no drink/food/pots). Thas with almost all armor enchanted with health glyphs.  The Real Question:   At what point do these attributes become vital/void. Do my abilities constantly scale with stamina indefinitely? How does the the Champion system directly effect me the most with this kind of build? Is it practical to run a build like this or am i micromanaging a little too early on?   Any help or suggestions are appreciated."
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,gunsandcars,3,Thu Jul 16 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about stats until V14. At that point it's just about hitting your numbers.

elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,tidfisk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:23 2015 UTC,I've been dumping most of my points into health until I need a bit more of stamina or magicka. Then I'll redistribute when I finally reach a vet rank. Having lots of health helps with basic survival.
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,Chromozon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:19 2015 UTC,"You need to post your health, magicka, and stamina values when buffed (because you will always be using food).

There's a catch though, I'm an altmer. Is there a way to make high elf passives (and high magicka overall) to help tanking?   It makes it easier to spam Puncturing Sweep, resto Ward and Inner Fire from Undaunted for example, but what else can help? Rune Focus is pretty cheap anyways, Sun Shield benefits from large health pool and S&B skills requre stam. So can magicka tank be at least viable on vet levels somehow?

If you have not leveled one hand thus far however,  you will need to buy a few skill points and slot them to level it up. Then you want dragon blood, the dragon armor and inhale.  Draconic power is really where you want to focus many of your skill points especially in the passives but definitely take two points in the earthen heart passive that restores health stamina and mana based on your ultimate cost. Combined with dragon blood pots and inhale it basically heals you to full health.  As far as ultimates go I like magma armor morphed to corrosive and dk standard for mob clearing."

Hardened Armor: huge, long lasting survivability buff. You should have this up at all times when tanking.  Obsidian Shield: group shield. Long lasting. Turn your magika into health.  Green Dragon Blood: emergency self heal, long lasting regen buff.  Extended Chains: need to pull something off the healer? Don't want to cross the room first? Ferocious Leap: make a splash, gain a shield.  Magma Shell: need to be really hard to kill for 10 seconds? Use this.   Max out all of your passives in draconic power, earthen heart, heavy armor and 1H + Shield.   Spiked Bone shield is amazing if you need to fill out an ability bar.   Get caltrops. Use caltrops for AoE aggro.   Get Defensive Stance. It belongs on your tanking bar.   Get someone to make you a 5 piece heavy armor Whitestrake's set every 6-8 levels. Or learn to make it yourself. That 5 piece bonus will save your butt.   Practice blocking heavy blows, not standing in the red circles, and interrupting spells.   If you have to choose, let the DPS die. Save the healer. Save yourself.   Go 2:1 health to stamina while you're leveling. It's a cheap respec when you hit veteran ranks. Get max health, stamina regen, and magika regen in that order.

elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,kuyan21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:30 2015 UTC,What are some good skills/passives i can get early (<lvl12) for a solo magika templar?
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,tidfisk,2,Thu Jul 16 12:43:54 2015 UTC,Take those light armor passives and any race passives that boost magicka regen or reduce spell cost. When my magicka templar was level 12 I was running around with a resto staff because heavy attacks would recharge my magick. So I'd DPS enemies down with my templar spells then finish them off with a heavy from the resto staff and be at full bar again.   I personally invest more in passives early on than I do abilities.

Pressure Points/Hemorrhage  Pros   2% crit chance, 10% crit dmg per assassination ability slotted Provides minor savagery (3% weapon crit) to nearby allies for 20 seconds every time you crit Always active   Cons   No heals   Combat Prayer  Pros   It's a decent heal provides minor resolve (armor and spell protection) provides minor berserk (8% increase to all dmg)   Cons   needs to be activated every 6 seconds to keep buffs active small frontal area of effect   So seeing all that which of the two is the more beneficial for the group? The NB will always get full effect and buffs from both, this is more of a question of whats the best support for the group.  -Pimli"
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,KaPoTun,2,Thu Jul 16 13:08:48 2015 UTC,"Get both.  The extra weapon crit will help your stamina dps allies, and combat prayer will help all of them.  On my NB healer though I have remorphed combat prayer to blessing of restoration for the extra heal that gives - it's an expensive but big heal good for when you're able to reach all/most of the group."
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,mrlighthill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'd take Combat Prayer because the buffs are better and it's a decent heal.   As for support, I keep Reaping Mark on my main healing bar for additional support and self healing. Mark the main target, reducing the enemy's physical and spell resistance, then healing you for 57% max health once it dies. This will let the group burn the enemy down quicker and help keep you alive without having to waste heals on yourself. It also helps everyone instead of just those benefiting from weapon damage.   You can get even more support by using Shadow Image to reduce a target's damage by 15% and then use Bolstering Darkness to reduce damage by another 30% to everyone in the radius, and 60% to you."

elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,PecorellaDP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Overall I would definitely suggest a Dragonknight or Nightblade. Dragonknight is more survivalbility but Nightblade will have more damage and focus on sneaking/ crits. Nightblade is more focused on melee, while DK can do melee or magicka. All up to you though."

I'm more attracted to Dragonknight than Nightblade. Is there a good selection of stamina-based Dragonknight skills that the Redguard can excel at? From what I've seen a lot of it looks like Magicka-based fire spells which I'm guessing a Dunmer would do better.

Not bad if I do say so because all of my gear is currently based around Stamina and Health. I'm thinking this could be an interesting build for Tanking/Healing with the bonus Stamina."

It's set for max AoE and quick strikes with ambush. Ambush is a skill that morphs to a Stam cost. But dark clock and sap essences both use magicka.  On my bow bar I use funnel health, focus aim, death mark, venom arrow, magnum shot. More of a single target focused bar with a space maker but funnel health is a good self heal as well as death mark.

The type you see in TES where you want to deal as much damage in a single strike and ""assassinate"" the target. Sadly, I'm the type of player who likes to make my character ""fit"" the part.   I've been told to go 2 hander, but it just doesn't feel right. Seeing a assassin running around with a giant greatsword. I don't mind the bow part however.  I really wanted to use dual wield. Is it possibly to use dual wield and still do lots of damage in one strike? What skills would you suggest getting in place of this.   Right now by the looks of it I think that just sitting back with a bow and opening with snipe would deal a lot more damage then getting in close and executing a surprise attack. Is this true?  Is there any possible way dual wield or any skill can come close to the amount of damage snipe puts out?"
elderscrollsonline,3dhqgv,TheGellinFelon,3,Thu Jul 16 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yes DW is effectI've as a single target dps with skills like marked target, ambush, twin slash and flurry you will be able to quick strick rapidly and effectively. I personally build my DW for AoE but if you were you use a combo of marked target, dark clock, ambush, twin slash, and personally I would use blade clock morph to quick clock for the speed boost to retreat if needed. Mark target and dark clock are magicka skills but worth it for the damage bonus.  The reason people suggest 2H is because it is the best weapon for single target Stam dps it has a closer, a booster a finisher and a self heal all in one. Throw in a skill like dark clock or marked target and you have dps gold.   Combo would be something like rally, mark target, crit rush, brawler, wrecking blow, dead.  For bow I personally focustomers on single dps, I use a funnel health for self heal, mark target to boost damage, focus aim for opener, venom arrow to stun casters and DoT, magnum shot to create space and knock back targets.  Hope this helps."

To level this is my suggestion till atleast 20ish.    use a skill from each of the skill trees to level them up together. Eventually you will start leaning on some thing more then others. wear a atleast 1 piece of each armor type. For you I suggest 5m/1l/1h that will help level your armor trees and give you more passives.  try new combos, good way to see if skills are good are to try them, respects are cheap early so if you don't like it you can change it. Good concept to follow: self buff or enemy debuff, closer, mid, finisher. Also remember that retreat is important in this game as well. Good example for 2H: (you won't have all these yet) mark target, momentum (rally), crit rush, brawler, upper cut. Your retreat is upper cut because it's a knock back but you could always use a second bar (when you get it) as your retreat. remember that your early and can try everything, even a magicka build is great for NB.

You'll sink so many skill points into crafting that you'll end up having to respec every time you want to try a new skill line/weapon type. If you hit end game and decide to focus on crafting, you'll have a better idea what you want your build to be like and you'll have more skill points to play around with. Outside of enchanting, everything levels up pretty quickly.  I'd say find a crafting guild or master crafter (search here for craft trading sites) for anything you need. Don't get too invested in gear before vet level, because you're just going to replace gear as you loot better stuff. If you're looking specifically for potions and enchantments, it's probably a good idea to research the ingredients for those (on the internet) and offer them to your crafter (along with gold). This will make their life a lot easier and they'll probably be more willing to help you out with special requests in the future.

elderscrollsonline,3djo8k,samzgr8,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"I never found a really good place in EP (my starter area), but when I got to DC for Cadwell's Silver, Daggerfall is a goldmine for potential finds. I start off at the entrance to the Outlaw's Den by the docks, run to the ships  and check the front and rear cabins (start with the left so you can jump off the side of the ship to the dock for the right ship... no running all the way around the dock), then run all the way up the stairs to the Fighter's Guild and Mage's Guild, then up to the castle. It's def a long route, but maybe 40-50 total cabinets/chests/nightstands/packs. I typically make the run to the bank after the castle (check the desks while you're there) to list/deposit any items that I had previously laundered, then run all the way back to the Outlaw's Den to sell/launder and refresh. In the last week I've found almost all of the regular motifs (too bad I already had them all) and a ton of recipes. Everyone says the drop rate for the rare motifs goes up in Cadwell's Gold, so you'll be well situated for some good finds when you get there."

elderscrollsonline,3djo8k,samzgr8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Drop rates in general are better in silver and gold. In silver you start seeing a lot more blue item treasure (sells to the fence for 250), and toward the end of silver and now at the start of gold, I've started to see purple item treasure (fence for 750!!). This is what will make the loot run in Daggerfall good for you at Gold. Even if you don't find motifs, you'll probably never be short on gold.  I randomly checked a pack today while exploring the shoreline in AD (my Cad's gold) and found an Ancient Elf motif. Still looking for the damn Imperial though haha"

Once you get to v14, assuming you are running trials, then you are going to want to target 20k in health.  That includes food and armor enchantments.  For my v14 templar healer I went with 2 points in stamina (need a little bit for dodge rolling) then split my remaining points evenly between health and magic.  I used armor enchantments to make up the rest.  I've now got 20.3k health, 29.7k magic, and 9k stamina.    The 20k health target came about because some of the baddies in the trials can hit you for an 18k shot to health.  Best to have a little cushion."

elderscrollsonline,3di2gc,TekaLynn212,3,Thu Jul 16 22:04:13 2015 UTC,It depends on what class you are. I am a sorcerer so place a majority of points into magicka. However if you were a tank character then you would need point in Stamina since it is directly related to physical attacks.
elderscrollsonline,3di2gc,jtboyd14,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:57 2015 UTC,This is wrong! You can definitely tank with a magicka build.

elderscrollsonline,3di2gc,jtboyd14,0,Thu Jul 16 15:50:40 2015 UTC,Why do you think you can't tank with a magicka build?
elderscrollsonline,3di2gc,AmpaMicakane,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:35 2015 UTC,I never said you can not tank with magicka... IMO Tanks are traditionally used to absorb damage and to have enemies target them instead of other players. Tanks are usually people that deal physical damage and constantly attack enemies and have healers and magicka units behind them. I just view tanks as close combat grinders.

elderscrollsonline,3di2gc,elbanofeliz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:44 2015 UTC,While you're leveling up to fifty I'd say it's mostly irrelevant. The damage of magicka skills is increased by having more magicka and the same goes for stamina skills and stamina. Once you hit veteran ranks your attribute allocation really depends on your build choice and personal preferences.

I was worried about my Templar healer being squishy wearing at least 5 pieces of light armour and not having any points in anything other than magic, but ended up putting 45 points in magic before I started to put anything in health and I don't even think of stamina. I still didn't hit the point where I felt like I really needed more health, I just didn't need more magic so I thought it could be a good moment to start building up health. I might have to tweak and find the most comfortable balance later though."

elderscrollsonline,3dit7d,jediprime74,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"Provisioning:  Acquire high level recipes, either by theft, having friends share them with you, or buying them from guild stores.  The higher the level of the recipe the more progress you get in your leveling when you prepare it. Doing the daily provisioning writ also helps with getting recipes and provisioning materials.  For blacksmithing, woodworking, clothier:  Deconstruct items made by other players.  Deconstructing crafted items gives a substantial boost when compared to deconstructing items picked up while out and about.  If you really want to powerlevel you need a few friends to craft a bunch of stuff for you with various traits and whatnot, then you break them down, make stuff, pass it to them, they do the same thing, pass back to you and you all get lots of progress in your crafting trees."
elderscrollsonline,3dit7d,collocation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:48 2015 UTC,I have loads of recipes for provisioning - over 75 if I remember correctly. Some much higher than my level (some even blue).

elderscrollsonline,3dit7d,Smffreebird,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"You will need more recipes, yes.  As many as you can get your hands on.  To get provisioning materials go to Cyrodiil.

Go to Bruma, Cropsford, and the other hamlets in Cyrodiil and go through the buildings, taking materials as you go.  Cyrodiil is like Wal*Mart, only free.  Provisioning writs can be a real bear, I've been there.  When the writ asks for a recipe you don't have, your only choices are to abandon the writ and hope for recipes you have the next day, to hit up your friends and ask if any have the recipe to give to you, or to hit every damn guild merchant in Tamriel to try to find it so you can buy it."

Few other things to note though:   While you're sneaking and it procs on a skill you're trying to use in sneak, the dwemer sphere will be visible to everyone around you including your enemies. The beam will also be visible and will give your position away if you're in PvP. The dwemer ball will also start to run towards the nearest enemy, even if he is in sneak. If no enemies are present nearby, the ball will either stay in place of follow you if you are running.

It basically builds around the Mark Target skill you get in the Assassination tree. It returns significant health when you kill the marked enemy in its morphed form (around 60%). Besides that, Killers Blade returns health, the Siphon tree is excellent and the Shadow tree is fun.   Besides that, depends if you wanna play Dual Wield, Bow, 2H, etc. You can even tank pretty well with Siphon and Sword and Board.  If you go Dual Wield, make sure to morph into Steel Tornado  EDIT:  An early 5 skills would be: either of the Assassin's Blade morphs, Ambush (morph on Teleport Strike), Rapid Strikes (morph on Dual Wield skill Flurry), dark Cloak, Strife.

Next I recommend putting one skill from each class tree on your bars, along with one skill from your main weapon's tree and one skill from your future second weapon (even though you won't be using it until level 15). Why you do this is because as long as an ability from a tree is on your bar you will level that skill line up. So when you get to level 15 you will have a well rounded character ready to go forward.  I don't have a build for you but at this low level just try out skills you think look interesting and find what works and doesn't work for you."

elderscrollsonline,3dknaw,necrotic_fasciitis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely the horse. The horse is account bound and shared across all your characters, although the upgrades to its speed, stamina, and inventory space are character specific. And if you really want you can buy the horse and start upgrading its inventory daily and get the best of both worlds"

elderscrollsonline,3dknaw,xThistle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:07 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion here but I am going to say bag and here is why.   You can train horse stats without a horse. From the moment you get the game you should be training your stats.  When you first get your horse it isn't even all that faster than you running but you will use the bag space immediately and you will still be training your horse for when you get your money back up again.

I saw no difference moving ESO from a hard disk to a really good SSD.  Game load time was the same.  Loading screen time was the same.  FPS stayed the same.

Reinstalling to an SSD removed the delay.  Other than that, nothing really changed. Loading screens seem to be a server-side delay, probably sending the zone's state to my PC. Lag is usually network or in rare cases CPU overload. FPS usually graphics card. An SSD helps none of these things.  But it's not like I'm using that SSD space for anything else, might as well have that dialog load more quickly. Because I want to know immediately that some stranger saved King Casimir's life!"
elderscrollsonline,3di6al,justinbrauchler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:32 2015 UTC,"SSD is great for the OS, and in some cases games with long loading screens.

Some games have been known to eat SSD's fairly quickly because they do a lot of read/writes (I hear this is the case for my coworker and SWTOR)"

Ex: I was a low level 32 when stumbling in Reaper's March, and found a map, which contained blue/green level 39 gear.    Also, soul gems are always a great thing to have, and are usually part of the loot.  EDIT: If you have skill points in a crafting passive that allows for more items upon deconstruction, then these maps become more valuable, as you can get the green/blue/purple? upgrade materials from deconstructing the items you find.  Also the items almost always have a trait, which you may be able to research."

But each time you gain enlightment you get 1 cp for 100k. So the formula of how much cp you will get is 32,5 + 0,75 * cp's while enlightment. (The 0,75 is because enlightment is xp times 4 and in the formula the xp counted towards vr levels is already in 32,5) So in the end it's just how fast you go through the levels, the slower you go the more enlightment you get while leveling up the more cp's."

elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,PhntmWolf,6,Thu Jul 16 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to respond honestly/bluntly point-by-point:   ""I kinda wanna RP a good-guy Vampire.""   ESO is not Dungeons and Dragons - many RPGs don't touch the ""good vs evil"" cliche with a 10-foot-pole.  Nothing prevents a Vampire from being ""good"", nor a Priest from being ""bad"".   I wonder if its even possible being in the Fighters Guild lore-wise.    I don't see this happening unless you're wearing a helmet 24/7 and never socialize with your peers (ie, other Fighters want to celebrate with a night drinking, but you either don't show up or don't drink & don't remove your helm).   Vampires in ESO (2nd Era) are directly tied to Lamae Beolfag - the first Vampire.  Her bloodline does not blend in.  Even ""well fed"", they're all bone-white with bloody eyes, a palor that no Nord could acquire naturally.  They don't burn nor weaken in sunlight (although they become stronger at night). Vampires in OBLIVION (late 3rd Era) were a unique Bloodline that came later - whose special ability was blending in with mortals if well-fed... but either (a) they don't exist yet in the game or (b) no one has discovered them.  Consider their ""special ability"" - while other clans turn into bat-monsters, or are immune to sunlight, or other crazy things... they ""used up"" their niche to just look human.    Advice would be appreciated   Straight up, Vampire RP is hard to find and often looked down upon.  My experience:   First, Vampires are supposed to be rare or hidden from society - so a lot of roleplayers find them distasteful by default.  And if they DO roleplay with you, their honest and not-sarcastic response is probably to try to kill you as the abomination you are.  Some RP guilds will not let you join - or will kick you out, if they discover you became one.  At BEST, most will ignore your Vampire and play with your other characters - the only RP I've done with my Vampire has been as ""generic enemy #4"" because, really, no one wants to befriend an undead parasite. Secondly, Vampire-lovers have a reputation of wanting to be ""Mary Sues"".  Google it.  And despite trying to play a Vampire myself, I must admit it seemed true (up until I simply left and got cured of Vampirism).  For example, I love/hate Pelinal Whitestrake and his genocide against all elves - so my Vampire was to be an exceptionally ""old soldier"", his face & torso & hands covered in burn marks from the wars of that time.  But that was it.  I like RP, I like PVP, so ""racist old Mer soldier that hates Men"" seemed a fine fusion.  Instead, when I began interacting with other Vampires?  Most of them wanted to be ""Princes"" or ""Nobility"" and ""Powerful"" and all this other self-absorbed stuff.  I just wanted Vampirism to explain my longevity - but I couldn't find a Vampire who didn't want to be ""awesome-by-default"". Third, there is a difference between what you ""are"" and what you ""do"".  In an all-Vampire guild with elements of RP, we were together because of ""what we are""... but at the end of the day, there wasn't much we ""did"" together.  Vampires don't have a lot of lore (so again, people tend to just use them as will-fulfillment fantasies).  I've had more fun in an all-Mage guild or all-Companions guild or all-whatever guild (where we're united by common interests as opposed to a supernatural STD).   TLDR:   Yes, you can be a good/bad (whatever) No, you can't deny your Vampirism in ESO (without hiding) Yes, you could technically join the Fighters Guild No, you're not likely to live while Meridia (who hates all undead) is their patron RPers avoid Vampires due to in-character reasons (no sane person wants to befriend a leech) RPers avoid Vampires due to out-of-character reasons (most Vampires are Mary Sue divas)"
elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,Marus23,2,Thu Jul 16 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting read and I don't even RP. I am wondering why the 3rd Era vampires decided to blend in with mortals instead of gaining a special ability. Maybe they were few in numbers and had to survive? No idea, but it's making me want to go read a bunch more lore."
elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,Knave_,3,Thu Jul 16 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"Just to quibble, it IS a special ability.  Vampires are monsters.  Making a walking corpse resemble the living is a pretty fantastic stealth ability, superior in many ways to invisibility, camouflage, etc.  THE TLDR VERSION: The ability to blend with mortals is essential in Cyrodiil, where you want to thrive & involve yourselves in the politics of the land.  Now the longer version:   When the gods created the world - at Lorkhan/Shor's suggestion - things went really badly (many died, others lost power, etc).  War ensued between those who stayed with Lorkhan (they became the gods of Men) and those who sought to (and did) punish Lorkhan/Shor (they became the god-ancestors of Mer). Creation was still very magical & chaotic & dangerous.  TOWERS were built as ""anchors"" for reality.  The Gods of Mer built Adamantine Tower (near Daggerfall).  The Gods of Men aren't credited with building any - but ""Red Tower"" (aka Red Mountain) formed from the ocean, where Lorkhan/Shor's heart was disposed of; ""Snow Tower"" (aka the giant mountain in Skyrim) has mysterious origins but is often associated with Kyne. When Mer came to Tamriel and discovered Adamantine Tower?  They built more Towers in their own image.  For example, [b]the Aldmer built Crystal Tower[/b] to help strengthen ties between magic & reality; [b]the Bosmer grew Green Sap Tower[/b], which taught them how to shape their forests & fates; [b]Red Tower, aka Red Mountain grew where Lorkhan's heart sank into the ocean[/b] (and when the Dwarves, discovered it later, the [b]Dwemer built Brass Tower[/b], an anthropomorphic 'robot' looking thing, trying to help their race ascend to divinity).  Every Tower has a symbolic ""stone"".   What does this have to do with Vampires?   Some Mer left to Cyrodiil to establish their own empire - and the [b]Ayleids built White-Gold Tower[/b] as a font of power & leadership & dominion.  The stone they used was a red gem... a drop of Lorkhan/Shor's blood, from when his heart was flung across Tamriel into the Ocean.  This gem would one day be the center piece of the Amulet of Kings. The Ayleids were friendly with Daedra - but viewed Men (back then, called ""Nedes"") as cattle & objects & slaves. When the slaves revolted - they tore the Ayleid empire from the inside-out.  As the new owners of White-Gold Tower & those territory, they became known as Imperials. Genocide against the Ayleids (and all Mer, and even Khajiit) followed.  Pelinal Whitestrake (whose legend is in the Knights of the Nine expansion to OBLIVION, which is set in Cyrodiil)... the guy was so bloodthirsty, he erased entire cities from the map, ripping out the ""neck veins"" of enemies with his teeth, and even butchering Khajiit (who he confused for Mer).   So what?   IF you look at the myth, the heart of the Empire had the blood of a pro-Man, anti-Mer god with power multiplied by a giant magical tower, surrounded by 8 other magical towers.... and suddenly the Man-slaves in the territory are visited with divine blessings and they begin slaughtering both Mer and Daedra alike. The Imperials were SO bad, that after the Alessian Order went into Breton territory - and a Nordic king died - King Wulfharth burned the Alessian priests alive, along with their temples to reinstate the old religion.  We're talking religious zealots who are so bad, your fellow Men kick you out of their lands and turn your priests to ash. And remember - Vampires are monsters created from when Molag Bal (a Daedric Prince) raped Lamae to death.   So as a Vampire, OF COURSE you want to blend in.  You're surrounded by once-religious-fanatics, who obliterated entire cities, an entire race, and anything else remotely similar to the monsters that once enslaved them.    And you're at the heart of the Empire - if you want to take advantage of ruler-ship and power and authority, then you WANT to blend in.  Cyrodiilic Vampires aren't about skulking in tombs for eternity.  The Vampire ruler of Skingrad would not have been a ruler for long if people didn't have doubts (rumors exist that he is a Vampire; but no one is crazy enough to piss off a ruler based on a rumor).  TLDR Version: Stealth is the greatest power a monster could desire, when it means (a) surviving religious fanatics and (b) sustaining power in the greatest empire on the continent in (c) a territory whose very landscape has been shaped by ancient-gods who favor Men over Monsters."
elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,Marus23,2,Thu Jul 16 21:03:56 2015 UTC,I wasn't thinking of it that way you are totally right. I also forgot that the vampires we see in Oblivion are at the heart of the Empire so of course blending in would be the ultimate power. Thanks for the insight.

If you point a sword at me I will act amused, because no one on Nirn can handle my power/swag. Weaknesses? Ha! That's funny. Oh and I'm aiming to rule the world because I want to, even though I have 4 followers""  9/10 Vampires are this person. I applaud you for deviating from this utterly overused stereotype."
elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,Artiemes,2,Fri Jul 17 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"Bruh.  Bruh, my sides.  Bruuuh. --- To anyone reading this, Artiemes is NOT exaggerating.    One night, our guild leader said there was ""RP"" and he wanted to get people together - so I rushed over.  When I arrived, he was pulling a ""my power will destroy you"" cliche with our arrival being his ""army of followers"" (a whole 5 of us).  Here I thought Vampires should keep their presence down-low, and he's making a spectacle in the middle of a city. Later, we go inside to meet other RP guilds - and he kept referring to his officers (I was one) as ""princes"".  I mean, I kept myself as ""just an old soldier"", but then he'd semi-""correct"" us as if he was Genghis Kahn and we're his warlord progeny.  I excused myself promptly from all the ""kings and queens"" (some Vamps, some just pretentious humans) and joined the drunkard soldiers downstairs, playing music and making up dirty limericks with them. Closest thing to ""regular RP"" was always using /honor and /salute when seeing ""higher ranked"" members.  Mind you, I was an officer, so it made me cringe to have some kid I just met treat me like some pompous elder.  I made a point of spoiling (with gear) anyone who remembered not to do that shit with me.  That was the extent of ""RP"".    Spot on description.  I'd wager...   6/10ths go for ""black base with red highlights"" (for armor & tabard). 2/10ths go for ""black base with blue highlights"" (for armor & tabard) - to be ""different"". 1/10th goes for ""bone-white"" (for armor & tabard) - with some red or black highlights. ...and the final 1/10th being somewhat normal and thus hard to identify as a Vampire.   As soon as race-change becomes available, I'm curing Vampirism and making a whole new identity for the character.  Top-tier cringe all the way.    Off-Topic: I wish Vampirism came with a ""PVP-flag"" - Everquest 1 had these priests to the ""god of chaos"" and if you went to them, you'd be flagged as PVP-able by everyone (no need to /duel ... anyone could attack you anywhere, and in return, they'd be flagged for PVP temporarily until one of you dies).  It was a great pro-hostile, pro-PVP feature, having these guys basically telling the world ""you can start sh#t but I will end it"".  Vampirism should have such a flag built-in (so Fighters Guild players can just hunt them in the streets if they're too obvious).  Maybe then they'd actually act like Vampires (luckily, Werewolves are no where near as intrusive nor pretentious).   /endrant"

A daedra hunter just said, ""You realize we can here you, abomination?"" and everyone turned on the Vamps. They replied, ""((What a bunch of Metagamers))"" and teleported out of there, causing everyone's blood to leave their own bodies, leaving all of us as shriveled husks. After they left, we just decided that a rogue khajiit had put skooma into the wine, causing all of us to hallucinate.  I've met three good vampires in all my time in DC and EP since launch.

elderscrollsonline,3dhz6p,Marus23,2,Thu Jul 16 13:41:08 2015 UTC,How is this not true?  Vampires are not inherently evil. That means that they can be decent beings.  The Fighter's guild constantly fight daedra and the four abominations. They have ways to testing to see if you are an abomination. There are telltale signs you're a vamp.

They cannot hide their Vampirism - even ""well fed"", you're as white as bone (and even a stereotypically ""white"" Nord will have pink tones due to blood under the skin).  The count of Skingrad (3rd Era) was a Cyrodiliic Vampire - a bloodline whose ""special ability"" was blending in when well fed.

Find the Stablemaster, it's 250 gold every day (20 hours), and when you do get your mount the stats you've paid for will be ready.  Regarding #7, I find blacksmithing and clothing way easier to level than enchanting, alchemy, even woodworking because you can steal tons of gear in a(ny) city without leaving and deconstruct them to get the raw mats right away (essentially laundering the stolen stuff instantly too). Much easier to level up just from deconstructing, and much easier to do the daily crafting quests."

Btw, One other thing I did learn very quickly is that you get very little gold value selling generic stuff to merchants, like armor or weapons you loot for example. If gear doesn't have the ""Ornate"" trait (sells for 280% value) you might as well research the trait, especially since like you said, almost all players want to spec in a crafting line. Researching time varies and I still don't quite understand the pattern for times (sometimes it's 6 hours, just the other day I started research on a trait that was like a full day AND a half - someone help?). Anyway, my ritual before logging off is always make sure I'm researching something and training a riding skill, as those take many hours."
elderscrollsonline,3die45,Invalice,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Research times double for every trait you've already researched for any particular item type. So, researching your first trait for 1hand swords will take 6 hours, but when you go to research your second trait for 1hand swords it will be 12 hours, third trait 24 hours, etc., while your first trait for 1hand axes will still be 6 hours.

Don't get me wrong, I like being able to truly customize how my character is played, but I can do that without being able to swap between ten different builds. I can literally go from a healer to a tank to a dps just by switching armor, and i still have unused points and a bunch i haven't even gotten (skyshard stuff).   For me a role playing game has defined roles. You can make your role whatever you want, but you can't play every role. I love this game, and I love the fact that i can truly customize a character, but it just takes away from the immersive experience when i see 10 characters are doing the same thing with small nuances."

I forget how much it decreases for those other pieces though. You can use the armor trait ""infused"" on your armor to increase the armor enchantment tho. I typically use that trait on head, chest, legs and shield pieces. But you can use to boost the enchants for others as well. Hope that helped."

elderscrollsonline,3dk5ms,FVLegacy,3,Thu Jul 16 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Both weapons have their own pros and cons, dual wielding has better aoe and allows for another slot to work with for set gear, two handed is a bit tankier. Wrecking blow is great single target dps. 2h also offers an execute and a gap closer, both of which are already offered in the nightblade skill lines. You can be quite successful with either weapon setup and comes down to your personal preferences and goals"
elderscrollsonline,3dk5ms,zackryz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:08:52 2015 UTC,This was more of the answer I was looking for. I think I'll be sticking with dual wield as it seems to synergize better with the Nightblade's abilities.
elderscrollsonline,3dk5ms,jwynkle35,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"Can you explain a little more regarding the extra slot of set gear?

I am just curious as I am using Bow/DW as a Stam nightblade.  I am only level 30, and still trying to figure out whats the best options for me to use with my Bow/DW abilities. Thanks!"
elderscrollsonline,3dk5ms,zackryz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:17 2015 UTC,Set gear has bonuses the more pieces of a set you wear the more bonuses unlocked. Dual wielding allows you to have two weapons equipped instead of just one if you used a 2h for example I have two swords of torugs pact on my sorc for the 2 piece set bonus. If I used a staff or other two handed weapon I'd have to wear a piece of torugs pact armor to achieve the same bonus

But here's the badass part. This guy was a vampire. I had silver bolts. I immediately turned around and silver bolted him to the fave which was followed by scorched earth, bombard, magnum shot, and then a poison injection. He melted. I felt so badass.

elderscrollsonline,3dk3ta,JAMESLJNR,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"unintended 15 minute duel in cyro with a stranded red zerger; I'm still relatively new to mmos, so still learning. I'm pretty much cookie-cutter dps glass-canon; the type that your typical hardcore real-deal type gamer loves to hack on in zone chat. Not specced for burst, so though my dps is very high, there was nothing I could output that he/she couldn't quickly undo. Conversely, their damage output wasn't enough to offer any real imminent threat. So we quickly get into a choriographed synchronized rotation of near deaths and recoveries that can't end unless one of us gets lazy.  After many such rotations, my opponent pulls back, presumably to recover resources/shot nerves, and I take advantage to do the same. Only there are other uses for having a few seconds, and before I know it a sweep of reds are educating me on why burst would have been good to spec for that day. I ran back to the nearby scroll shrine, hoping to enlist a few npcs to even the odds, but a half-dozen lucky shots ended my ""duel"".  On a server that has been until very recently abandoned by any serious blue guilds, and now dominated by red guilds, me and a few pugs, deciding blue has no response to the situation (except for a few 'elites' stepping in for a few hours, being frustrated, bitching about how shit red is, how shit blue is and running away), joined a yellow siege on red keeps. It was a weird feeling, fighting side-by-side with people who have probably raged about you and everything you are about for a good hour or so. We kept expecting them to turn at any instant, but the moment never came, and we helped each other secure keeps. Weird, but definitely fun.  A former red emperor held off, and eventually wiped, our small, invading task force with little more than clever use of veiled strike and judicious employment of the keep's npcs. Pretty embarrassing. Several members ragequit, but another pug and I went back just to see. We impotently set up siege once again. For all two pugs could do, he might have left us there. But he came out to teach us a lesson - veiled strike, stun lock, high dps, ap. Rinse, repeat; how simple life can be. But noone uses defensive rune, so it must have been quite a shock. Precious moments wasted wondering wtf just happened, subsequent moments lost in the realization that he was about to lose to two no-namers.  Edit: duEl, not dual."

elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,Mallrat1973,12,Wed Jul 15 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, from what we know:  There will be a currency similar to the seals from DF.  There will be open PvP in a large portion of the dungeon.  There will be world bosses (oh please let there be something like Legion there).  The dungeon gets more difficult the deeper you go, requiring working with people when deep down.  The beginning sewer areas are a PvE friendly area, similar to how DF's enterance started at lvl 25 and moved up the deeper you went.  Access to the Imperial City changes based on how the PvP campaign is going."

elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,RumbleMR2,3,Thu Jul 16 00:02:42 2015 UTC,That is a really good question. I assume the mobs need to have a level
elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,RelaxIMMAdoctor,4,Thu Jul 16 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"They do, and they will be VR16. Since you enter Imperial City through Cyrodiil, it is tied to your campaign (though remember that what you do in Imperial City doesn't affect Cyrodiil) so you will be battle-leveled appropriately. Hope that makes sense!"
elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,ZOS_GinaBruno,3,Thu Jul 16 14:20:11 2015 UTC,Will the V16 mobs actually drop VR16 gear?   Not just in dungeons but in the open world?  We have had this problem before where mobs drop underleveled gear and it is really frustrating.   It was really frustrating getting VR11-VR13 gear in craglorn.  With VR14 only reserved for certain dungeons. Also the undaunted VR12 cap was frustrating.  Now we all have VR12 monster helms that could have been VR14 and only be 2 levels under cap instead of 4.    Please try to convince the itemization team not so be so stingy this time.  We would like to have VR16 gear in preparation for your next DLC where you bump it up to VR18.

elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,TeamRedundancyTeam,-2,Wed Jul 15 23:07:03 2015 UTC,i don't know but since when do content patches cost money?
elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,zzzornbringer,2,Thu Jul 16 11:05:51 2015 UTC,"There is a massive amount of content for all groups of players.  Think of it more like an expansion pack, should it really be free?  20$ for what we're getting is very very cheap anyway.  Makes me wonder though, Skyrim DLCs cost 20$ as well, and yet they had what? Heartfire a very basic housing, and Dawnguard castle + 5 quests. Seriously this DLC has 100x more content than both of them combined. But hey nobody complained back then, even though those Skyrim DLCs were worthless."
elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,Despair9,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"skyrim doesn't have a cash shop or an optional premium membership.  also, this is not an expansion. how much content there will be, is still not exactly known.   if you ask me, this is a content patch. that's what it is, right? but it's behind a paywall.  that sucks. it especially sucks for eso plus members, because you have to spend your crowns on the content. membership only gives you temporary access as long as your sub is active.   if you ask me, i think the dlc should get reduced to 15$ and when you have an active eso plus membership, you get that dlc and you can keep your monthly crowns. that's how other games do it. they give you the dlc without additional cost when you have a premium sub."
elderscrollsonline,3ddu0k,zzzornbringer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"Skyrim is also at least 10x smaller than ESO and you didn't have to pay 300$ for ESO right?  ESO's Cash Shop is nothing but full of Cosmetics, DLC concept is essentially the same as we were used to from other ES games, but with a ton more content added into the game. If Skyrim DLCs which had nearly no content at all cost 20$, how is it normal to expect ESO DLCs will be less?  Actually it's been pretty known that there will be a lot of content. Nearly all the information has been datamined for months already. It's clear that the Imperial City with it's huge Sewers System will be as big as 1 Normal ESO Zone or perhaps even more. And well 1 ESO Normal Zone is as big as 3 WoW Zones, so you can be sure that we're getting more than half of the content of WoD with just 1 ""City"".  I mean WoD got 7 dungeons, out of which were 2 rehashed, so only 5 new. While ESO is getting 4 new PvE dungeons + 1 PvP dungeon and probably even some kind of Arena PvE or PvP. This ""Content patch"" is adding more dungeon content than whole Draenor expansion did. It's easily worth more than 20$, especially when you compare it with other MMOs or anything on the market."

elderscrollsonline,3diyr3,Tybirious,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"Collect everything.  Don't get worried about where you are putting your skill points to begin with because you can respec later AND there are plenty of skill points to be had so don't let a possible lack of them scare you.

elderscrollsonline,3diyr3,Lord_Blackthorn,4,Thu Jul 16 17:41:49 2015 UTC,Some of this is awful advice.  Do not collect everything. You inventory will fill up with 0 value items almost instantly.  My suggestion would be as follows.   Make a Character Play through the quests and intro until you are around level 5. Do your alliance's crafting certification quests. Decide on one or two crafting skills you would like to pursue. Only pick up material for those crafting skills (so dont pick up alchemy junk or provisioning ingredients if you are not doing them) Place skill points first in a few good attacks and then in those crafting skills as well. You need attacks though to go do anything. Place your attribute points wherever you want. The difference they make at low levels is negligable at best. I tend to do half hp and half in the other stat I use. He was correct in saying EXPLORE. There is more to the world than meets the eye and you almost always can stumble into something worth while. Collect Sky shards/ Read Lore books/ Use Bookshelves/ Collect Recipes/ Collect Motifs/ Research Item Traits/ Upgrade your horse (even before you get it) at the stables.

When I was asking similar questions a month ago, the info I got was you can grind anything level 46 and up, and the exp for V1 versus V10 monsters is not enough of a difference to automatically justify the higher-VR takes-longer-to-kill stuff.
