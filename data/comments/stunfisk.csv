stunfisk,3e5jz2,aravar27,2,Wed Jul 22 03:06:45 2015 UTC,It should be known that mega ampharos is a pretty decent rain abuser cause a base 110 STAB attack coming off of that special attack stat HURTS. I used it on a UU rain team a some time ago and man that thing was Just so powerful.
stunfisk,3e5jz2,Splotzker,2,Wed Jul 22 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"Hidden Power deserves a mention. Ice gets past Gligar, and Grass nails Swampert for big damage. Heal Bell should also be listed; it's a great move to fit on any team. Power Gem isn't viable, since it is resisted by ground types and hits only marginally harder on super effective hits than a neutral Thunderbolt. Also, Agility sets should run speed, probably near max. Finally, you might want to mention Trick Room support as a team option."
stunfisk,3e5jz2,litony,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"Regardless of agility or no, offensive sets should run some speed. Base 60 has a few Pokémon you might want to out speed for example"

stunfisk,3e4siz,JengaJeff,2,Tue Jul 21 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Hawlucha would probably appreciate a focus sash over a situs berry because it has terrible defences.   I'd like to see t-bolt over volt switch but that's just a preference.   You could try lum berry on chomp to get more out of him w/ outrage.   It's probably just a typing error but Talonflame has gale wings right?  Overall the team looks strong but your cousin might want to add another special attacker. As of now you have 4 physical attackers, one mixed and one special. This leaves you susceptible to burns and physical walls. It's not necessary that he adds one but I'd recommend it."
stunfisk,3e4siz,Tacoslim,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"Talonflame does have Gale Wings, that was definitely an error! I think Focus Sash could be important too, the move set I found used Substitute so it could proc the Sitrus that way, which I don't think he needs to worry about right now for just getting started. I also like Lum Berry on the Garchomp as well since it could stop a burn, I will have to pass that along to him! Thank you so much!"

stunfisk,3e4siz,a_c_31,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"I just started using the Unburden Hawlucha @ Sitrus Berry and that it is one of my new favorites to use by far! Here's my suggestions for making his more effective:   Go full hp investment, instead of spe. When that sitrus berry gets eaten up, your speed doubles and you're way faster than everything, even scarfed pokes like Garchomp. The bulk allows you to survive just about all neutral hits and even some non-stab super-effective ones. Adamant nature. Maximize atk because 92 isn't really scaring many pokes with at least decent bulk. Instead of High Jump Kick and Flying Press I like to run Drain Punch. More often than not, you will be able to get a Swords Dance off, then your berry will proc. Drain Punch at +2 will hit hard even on neutral hits so this helps to give you sustain. The 4th move I run is Thunder Punch, just for extra coverage. This let's you hit threatening flying types not named Talonflame and is good because most Ice Beams/Punches come from water types, which you can now hit super (sans Swampert, Rotom-W, etc). Hawlucha has a great movepool with a lot of options, though. Taunt is another great option here because it neutralizes the threat of most set-ups, thunder waves and will-o-wisps. Or there's Encore. Lock your opponent into a status move, get an extra Swords Dance in.   If he really is set on using High Jump Kick I'd go with Hone Claws over Swords Dance. This way there's no worries about losing that 50% of health other than Protect. Hope this helps! Awesome hearing about the bond you guys share through Pokemon! :D"
stunfisk,3e3lup,Portugal22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"You have Protect on Thundurus, which you should use on a Pokemon with a choice item. Use another coverage move like Grass Knot, Dark Pulse, or Focus Blast.  Gyarados seems like a strange pick, you can't use discharge at all with him around. I'd reccomend not being so reliant on the discharge thing- especially since Wide Guard ruins your day. At the very least just use Thunderbolt on Rotom so you have another option when Sceptile isn't on the field.  Aegislash alone isn't even close to a counter to trick room teams, it just increases your match up against them a little bit. Trick room is definitely this team's biggest fear at first glance. It's a great, great poke but I'm not sure it fits on this team.   You sorely need another physical attacker, and I bet this team really wants a Taunt user. Those are things to consider when you think of a replacement for Gyarados and Aegislash. Maybe try Assault Vest Landorus? That doesn't help your Taunt problem but it's immune to discharge and has a stronger EQ."
stunfisk,3e3lup,Metalhead62,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:38 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply!  I agree with Thundurus, I'll make sure to give him another coverage move.  I don't really agree that Gyarados is a strange pick. There really isn't a reason for me to use discharge if I switch him in. He does however take advantage of Sceptile's Lighting rod ability and takes away his 4x weakness to electric. Also completes a FWG core.   Yeah Aegislash is just a pokemon I slapped on this team. But he does work. He's not a complete answer to trick room, but he helps with that match up and he's done well so far in testing. If you have a suggestion to replace him with that'd be really appreciated. I was thinking about Sableye. He's a physical attacker, and he provides support (Taunt and Wilo, and I could add T-Wave onto Rotom-H) which is nice. A knock off user is really nice too. But i'm not sure if Celfable + Sableye is a great idea.   I have a lot of pokemon in mind but can't really decide haha, so if you're open to help some more that'd be awesome! Again I really appreciate your response."
stunfisk,3e3qzp,talhatoot,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of things about your team,   Breloom would rather have rock tomb over stone edge. It gets better power, accuracy and has the speed drop, and low sweep doesn't get the technician boost so if you want a strong fighting move go with force palm.  Maybe volt switch on forretress over toxic spikes because they dont hit a lot of things in ou and having a slow volt switch can let you bring in breloom or honchkrow for free.  Finally maybe moving the evs from goodras special defense to either physical defense or special attack might get you some better results but thats up to you"

As far as I am concerned, slowly breaking a carefully built and used stall team is one of the best feelings in competitive pokemon. I only find playing against stall to be demoralizing demoralizing when I didn't properly prepare my team to beat it, because then I'm remided how much I suck at teambuilding offensive teams.   By comparison, playing against HO feels much worse. I never feel like I was in charge of the outcome of the battle. I either have the right team composition to win the matchup against the enemy and I win, or I don't and I lose. In any case, I never feel like I accomplished much, or that I outplayed the opponent. I can't even appreciate the fack that I have built a good team, since it is impossible to cover every HO composition, so unless I choose to forgo the ability to beat any other playstyle, winning or losing the matchup is effectively random from my standpoint."
stunfisk,3e17sq,Cifra00,20,Tue Jul 21 12:55:02 2015 UTC,Stall is my favorite play style because it makes games last longer and makes each player really have to plan out how to proceed to get past troublesome Pokemon.

It is such a necessity in doubles for things like scouting or just defending. The general rule is usually unless the pokemon is equipped with a choice item or assault vest, you run protect. There are some exceptions like bulky Thundurus and Mega Kanghaskhan, but your team will really appreciate Protect.  Most terrakions run Rock Slide instead of Stone Edge for a multitude of reason. It hits both pokemon on the opponent's side of the field. It can flinch. It has better accuracy than Stone Edge. Also don't know why you're running a choice item with swords dance.  Most Milotics run Competitive in doubles as its great at checking Intimidate users. Cute Charm is really unreliable. With Cute Charm you're betting on the chance that the pokemon has an opposite gender, if it even has a gender at all, and you're also betting on that small 30% chance that it will infatuate the opponent. Toxic is also pretty bad in doubles because it takes way too long to kill an opponent in such a fast paced environment.  I generally don't recommend Hi-Jump Kick in doubles, because Protect causes it to miss and pretty much cripples the amount of health.  Your team doesn't have any Steel or Poison moves to hit Fairy Types for super effective damage."

stunfisk,3e3y2v,_RooseBolton,3,Tue Jul 21 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"No. There was an April Fools joke this year where Showdown had a suspect to reintroduce Giratina-O back into OU. As expected, people realized it was too much for OU (as are all Ubers) and it was kept in Ubers (also it was a joke so it was never going to be moved down anyway).    But the most common example I know when people bring this up is that Greninja is low level in Ubers. I don't play Ubers, but I've heard that it's just used as a hazard setter/suicide lead most times, and is considered low rank. However, it was considered way too high rank in OU and over centralizing with its new ORAS moves (Low Kick, Gunk Shot), and so will stay in Ubers. Before M-Rayquaza, Ubers was just a ban list anyway, and I don't see any reason why they might unban some of those OP Pokemon."
stunfisk,3e3y2v,oftheking,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:32 2015 UTC,I understand that a lot of high end ubers will obviously stay there but I was thinking a possible suspect test for some that were banned when xy came out like mega mawile to see how the current meta can cope with them

No one Pokemon can do either of those things and it gives the impression that you can switch into every physical or special threat in the game, but it does not work in practice. Checking at least most of the major threats in a tier requires the whole team's effort, not a 2-3 Pokemon core."
stunfisk,3e1tpm,Portugal22,6,Tue Jul 21 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"On Sceptile, two Leaf Storms are stronger than 2 Energy Balls. So I would use Leaf Storm.   Instead of Heatran I would use a Rotom-H with Safety Goggles to counter Amoonguss. Amoonguss resists both Grass and Electric. Unlike Heatran Rotom can be another Discharge user that can pair with Sceptile or Thundurus-T.   I'd also like to point out, you probably want Thundurus-T to outspeed Sceptile, and Discharge before Sceptile attacks. For this reason I would use a Choice Scarf set on Thundurus-T.  Gyardos and Azumarill are two nice Physical attackers, Sceptile's Lightning Rod will protect them from Electric type attacks."

Play with the team and try to find out what gives your team problems.  If you can figure this out, it's easier for people to help you. A bit of explanation for each pokemon.    What does each pokemon do?  What is its specific role on the team?  If it has unusual or custom built evs, what is the purpose of the evs?

Sadly, I am on my phone, so no Showdown formatting, but I will come back and edit later:  I saw a redirection + Rock Polish build once on Battle Spot. It wrecked me. Basically, something with Follow Me or Rage Powder combos with Groudon to set up a single Rock Polish, then at +2 speed it destroys everything. This set would appreciate Rock Slide, and as you are adamant, like mine,  I suggest Fire Punch. It worked out for me in a WiFi competition with the 3 attacks and Protect, but do consider either 3 attacks and RP or two attacks, RP and Protect.  Groudon would enjoy Gravity support to ensure you hit all your attacks. If you do decide on a Rock Polish set with a redirection partner,  I know Clefable is able to use Gravity and Follow Me.  As for the rest of the team, you currently really need a way to beat Ground types. You have 1 weakness under normal conditions and 2 under gravity, if you choose to go with it. For that reason, I suggest you look into bug types. As for which ones, that's your choice."

In fairy tales, there have been various instances of fairies being allergic to metals, so that sorta makes sense. In fairy tales fire-breathing dragons are often villains so that makes sense as to why fire resists fairy. Poison is common in fairy tales, as in snow white etc. and so although it is a stretch, I can see why it is super effective. Furthermore, darkness almost never prevails in fairy tales so that is explained too.   But bug?? I can definitely see gamefreak making poison super effective on fairy to help buff poison types, considering they were only super effective on grass beforehand. But making fairy resist bug doesn't even make sense balance-wise, because of how lack luster bug is offensively and defensively."

Mega Cherrim  Grass/Fairy  Ability: Hanami (which is Japanese for ""cherry blossom viewing,"" a time that most Japanese set aside to take in the beauty of the cherry blossoms each spring): While this Pokemon is on the field, Grassy Terrain becomes active, and remains active until this Pokemon faints or switches out.  70 / 60 / 110 / 107 / 117 / 85  +40 to both defenses, and added Fairy typing should make this thing pretty difficult to take down without Poison.

At the very least, we need some Pokemon that can bring them out automatically, but we also probably need some buffs to them.

More Grass attack power?  Free Leftovers?  Reduced damage from EQ?  Your opponents get all these benefits as well, unless he happens to have a ton of Flying/Levitate/Air Balloon Pokemon, but honestly, what team ever has more than maybe 3?  Yes, you can tailor your team to abuse the terrain, such as having more Grass moves, and more grounded Pokemon.  But there are still 2 problems.  One, Grass just isn't as effective offensively as things like Water and Fire, which can get boosts from weather.  And 2, while these things will indeed help you gain slightly more from the terrain than your opponent (the key word is slightly), these things are nothing compared to the ability bonuses that many Pokemon gain from weather.  Yes, I know Gogoat has a terrain-activated ability, but it's the only one, while there are probably over 100 Pokemon with many different weather abilities.  It would be nice if a bunch of Pokemon gained abilities that activated in terrain, or if they just buffed them a little so one side could take a bigger advantage of them, then it could be as prominent as weather, but until then, it's probably not worth it.

Cherrim has Weather Ball to abuse and has a sun-related ability in base form, so I thought having it make sun would be cool.

Solar Beam is STAB and obligatory on sun sets. Giga Drain is also STAB and can give recovery, but Grass Knot can be used for more damage on things like Slowbro, Hippowdown, and Tyranitar. Fiery Dance can now help Cherrim sweep, and Earth Power hits Poison, Dragon, and Fire types that would trouble the dual STABs. HP Rock can be used for flying types. Protect can be used for a safe mega.  You can change up the EVs for different power benchmarks.  Cherrim would compete with Charizard Y as a Drought user, though the former would be a sweeper and the latter a wallbreaker.

stunfisk,3dygcf,MegaMissingno,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"Mega Delcatty  For some reason, I wanted to try and make Delcatty signature ability Normalize useful and I really struggled to do so. However, I present to you:  New moves: Toxic Spikes (when used by Normalize Delcatty, they will have Normal type's effectiveness. As such, they will be able to poison Steel types and don't get removed by Poison types. On the other hand, Ghost types are are immune and grounded Normal types remove them), Shadow Claw  Type: Normal -> Normal/Ghost  Ability: Defiant  Stats:   HP: 70 Att: 65 -> 95 (+30) Def: 65 -> 115 (+50) SpA: 55 -> 25 (-30) SpD: 55 -> 105 (+50) Spe: 70   Okay, from competetive design perspective, Mega Delcatty is supposed to be anti-hazard removal pokémon. As such, Ghost type is added for blocking Rapid Spin and Defiant is supposed to discourage Defog usage. Defenses are increased massively to make Mega Delcatty capable of taking hits. Thanks to the new mechanic of Toxic Spikes I added, Delcatty's main appeal will now be the ability to poison Steel types and therefore break through many walls that used to laugh in front of status, for example Heatran.  Example set:   Delcatty @ Delcattite  Ability: Normalize  Impish  252 HP / 4 Att / 252 Def   Toxic Spikes Wish Protect Return / Shadow Claw   The main objective of this set is to set up Toxic Spikes and then proceed to keep them up, all while passing Wishes to team mates and dishing out damage with a STAB move of choice. While Delcatty won't be reaching among the top dogs of OU, these changes could support it being the coolest cat in UU with the occasional appearance in OU."
stunfisk,3dygcf,ThreeTwenty320,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:21 2015 UTC,Thunder Wave would also be a good move to run as Normalize would allow it to paralyze Ground types.   Though why would you ever run Shadow Claw when Normalize just makes it a weaker version of Return?   EDIT: Nevermind. Thought Mega Delcatty's ability was still Normalize.

Sort of a less powerful version of Mega Mawile, but with different coverage options and a reduced ability to outrun common defensive pokemon. Can also make use of a massive support movepool while retaining enough strength even uninvested to threaten things. Also gets Curse as a new move to facilitate a slow setup style of play.   Sample Set  Delcatty @ Delcatite Adamant Nature Wonder Skin -> Pure Power 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe  - Play Rough  - Sucker Punch  - Fake Out  - Wake-up Slap / Wild Charge    Delcatty-M hits a solid 612 attack, but as it suffers somewhat from Weavile syndrome it's still possible to check it defensively without too much difficulty. Specially Defensive Heatran with Flash Cannon survives even Wake-up Slap and takes little damage from everything else, while dealing very heavy damage in return. Similarly, Skarmory avoids a 2HKO from everything but Wild Charge and can set spikes or hit Delcatty very hard with Iron Head. However, more offensive Pokemon will find the combination of Fake Out + Sucker Punch very difficult to handle. It bulk is not incredible, but good enough that it will defeat defensive Landorus-T 1v1 if the latter switches into a Play Rough, thanks to it's ability to survive two uninvested earthquakes."

You basically always use it to either set up tailwind, or abuse disable trap. It doesn't need more than 4 moves to perform either role.  Sylveon is an example of the third.

stunfisk,3dyont,TheWetMop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"A couple of reasons, I would guess   On physical Mence, the moveset almost has to include protect, DD, and Double Edge/Return. This leaves you one slot where it has to compete with EQ (better coverage) Roost (better survivability) Dragon Claw (better damage) On mixed mence, being able to hit steels with flamethrower is more important. you still need protect, hyper voice, and double edge. On special mence, it just doesn't do enough damage to use over hyper voice"

I know Tyranitar runs Flamethrower (I think Fire Blast is a better option since you can move some EVs from Sp. Attack) but how does a Mega Scizor or Choice Band Scizor match up with your EV spread for these three? I'm at work or else I'd do the damage calculations myself.  I also think a more defensive spread for Rotom-W is better suited while you whittle down walls like Sylveon or Heatran with status like Thunder Wave or Toxic."
stunfisk,3dyh2z,DavisWuhu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"Mega Alakazam is a large threat to this team.  You may want to try a more supportive, defensive Heatran.  This would also let your team benefit from forcing switches by adding on chip damage from more consistent Stealth Rock."
stunfisk,3dyh2z,TheLaughingCat2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree Alakazam can be an issue. But the thing is that if Heatran becomes support, then I struggle against stall, as Scarf Lando, Manectric, and Weavile don't have the trapping capabilities nor Taunt or Toxic capabilites of Heatran, Keldeo can't break stall alone, and Latios is inconsistent with the drops from Draco Meteor. I could try Defensive or EP Lando and Scizor over Heatran, but once again I face issues with stall unless Lando or Scizor have SD. I guess it's an inherent flaw on my team, and when I see Alakazam I guess my bet is to keep SR up and constantly force it out with Landorus or Weavile (Ice Shard). Alakazam also has to rely on FB to hit Weavile and Heatran, so I'll hope for misses (though this is a very shaky strategy). Thanks!"

stunfisk,3dzfb5,Porkymon38,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"Using dragonite to defog rocks for dragonite after dragonite has taken rocks damage is a little self-defeating.   I don't have a DS or anything and I play exclusively on simulator, but I would probably familiarize myself with Smogon's tiering philosophy if you're playing singles and/or Smogon Doubles and the VGC rules if you're playing VGC."
stunfisk,3dzfb5,Housesize,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:14 2015 UTC,Good point. See I need all the help I can haha. I'm going to study up on doubles. I've always done well with double battle format. Thank you for the insight
stunfisk,3dzfb5,CVTHIZZKID,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"It matters a lot what format you are playing. If you are doing Smogon singles, you'll have to play in OU, since both Dragonite and Garchomp are in that tier. The other main formats are Smogon Doubles, VGC Doubles (official Nintendo format), and Battle Spot Singles (not recommended). Smogon battlers tend to play on the Pokemon Showdown simulator, so if you're playing on cartridge then you most likely want to look into VGC doubles.   I don't really play doubles so I can't much help you build a team. But I can tell you that it's really important to think in terms of counters to specific pokemon, not just types. For example, you can't just throw a poison type like Nidoking onto your team and just think it's going to take care of all fairy types. Because if you come across a Mega Gardevoir, they'll almost certainly be running Psychic or Psyshock, and can easily outspeed and one hit KO you.   The top fairy threats in VGC are mainly Sylveon, Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Togekiss. You'll also see Whimsicott, Klefki, and Aromatisse, but they are more support pokemon and don't always run attacking moves. So these are some pokemon to watch out for if you're worried about fairies in VGC."
stunfisk,3dzfb5,Alsenis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"Dragonite works very well with Weakness Policy because of its ability. But to ensure that you want to make sure that Stealth Rocks are gone so running Defog is inefficient. Fire Punch provides better coverage in OU whereas Thunderpunch hits things that Dragon Claw or Outrage would already do neutral damage to with the exception of something like Empoleon.   With Dragonite and Garchomp you leave yourself at the mercy of any strong Ice Shard user like Weavile Mamoswine and Cloyster. I suggest picking one of the two and replacing with either a defensive wall like Ferrothrorn or a Pokemon that resists a STAB Ice Shard and can return good damage like Scizor or Heatran.   In terms of strong Fairy types you're looking at Azumarill, Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Clefable. Azumarill would bring the fairy type and water typing to cover up some of your weaknesses. But in doing so you bring a lot of physical damage to the team which makes the likes of Skarmory and Ferrothorn a problem.   I'd definitely keep Dragonite, Zoroark and Snorlax (but if you want a strong Heavy Slam user, look into Mega Aggron). Azumarill sounds like a welcome addition as well.   As for Aerodactyl and Garchomp, I think adding Excadrill or Gliscor to your team is a better option because between either Excadrill/Gliscor and Dragonite, you would bring the same coverage and type of damage to the team. Excadrill also has Rapid Spin to remove the rocks that Dragonite hates.   From here I'd recommend Mega Venusaur as it is a good check to Ice Shard users once it's evolved and checks other Azumarill or Starmie that can do serious damage to your team. If not Mega Venusaur, then perhaps Rotom-W since it provides good support and anything its weak to, your other Pokemon can take it.   Also it would help if you included what type of moves, EV Spreads, and items you'll be using on each Pokemon so the purpose of each is more clear."
