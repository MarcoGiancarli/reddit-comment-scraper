sloths,3e2l1m,pnewell,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"The brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) is the most popular of the four species of three-toed sloth. Adult males of this species are easily distinguished from females by a distinct pattern of short, pale, gold-colored hair on their backs, and a black stripe drawn vertically through, with scattered dark spots. Females have stripes and spots as well, but without the orange coloration. These markings are unique to each sloth like fingerprints are to humans and are therefore very useful for individual identification in research! The distinct eye and mouth markings in the brown-throated sloth tend to make it look like they are always smiling!  Here is a picture of a male for reference   SLOTH Facts!"

sloths,3d0xjj,zombies8mybrain,2,Mon Jul 13 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"Come to Budapest then! The sloth house in the zoo gives free reign to the animals and they often chill near the windows where the visitors' walkway is, so you can pet and feed them if you are careful enough.   The fur on the back of the adults is pretty rough and they do smell a bit, but they are still the best!  Video (not mine): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWEbJ7-aT9A"
sloths,3d0xjj,zombies8mybrain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Oh wow I totally want to feed a mama and baby sloth apples. I just looked up plane tickets and they're a little to expensive for me. One of these days though if I can save up the money.
sloths,3d0xjj,Fairy_floss84,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:27:28 2015 UTC,You should have not told me that. I am going to Europe this year and no I have to go there.
sloths,3d0xjj,MrsTtt,3,Mon Jul 13 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"Do! Budapest is an awesome city and not just for the sloths.   Just be careful around them, they aren't toys and we have heard that some stupid and careless visitors had to go for tetanus shots after being bitten. The adults can be surprisingly quick if they feel threatened and they love apples and carrots (thinly sliced). Some keepers are chill with visitors petting them, others will warn you not to, but they have places to be while you can stay as long as you'd like.   Check /r/budapest , /r/travel and /r/hungary for ideas and info!"
