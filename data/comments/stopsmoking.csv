stopsmoking,3e41qk,80sSynth,9,Tue Jul 21 20:07:37 2015 UTC,Good luck and keep it going. Just remember you are trying to quit and not replace smoking with vaping.
stopsmoking,3e41qk,kovacz,3,Tue Jul 21 20:24:17 2015 UTC,"you are trying to quit and not replace smoking with vaping   Can't emphasize this enough. I know ""ex-smokers"" who vape now, and it's an addiction like any other. Safer? Sure. Harmless? Fuck no."
stopsmoking,3e41qk,MOSh_EISLEY,5,Tue Jul 21 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I second and third these posts!  This is how I quit combustion cigarettes, weaning down to zero nicotine. Now I keep the e-cig around for those stressful and random urges. A couple puffs even though it's zero nicotine help get past those urges to light up."

stopsmoking,3e3tar,relevantlife,7,Tue Jul 21 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yes they can be intense. That's the addiction talking. You want to know the best thing? The physical, chemical side of the addiction is almost over. By hour 72, your body will be almost done processing whatever nicotine is left in your system. After that, you only have to deal with the psychological side.  You have learned to give cigarettes a lot of power. You may think they relax you, that they get you ready for action, that you enjoy the taste... guess what? These are all lies.   We know that tobacco is disgusting. Tastes and smells like shit. We tell ourselves the lies to justify smoking. But they're nothing but lies. Cigarettes do nothing for you. They make you stink. They stain your teeth. They make you sick. And they don't even get you high, FFS.   You don't need them. The 'worst' is almost over. That's the addiction dying. One puff and it will be back to full strength. Don't let it. You can do this. You already are a non-smoker."

Your flair says 31 days, btw...... but hey .....don't let that bother you. I'm 24 hours in and head is racing. Been through this before. I won't lie. You're in the middle of a shit-storm. It will pass though. Last time I did this, day 3 was THE WORST. After day 5, it was MUCH easier and I stayed off for a year. (Then I was a dumbass and smoked ..... and now I'm just starting day 2. Yaaay!).   Don't let them 64 hours be wasted. Hang in there. You are doing awesome.... and it is worth it!"
stopsmoking,3e50cy,Kazagaroth,2,Wed Jul 22 00:25:38 2015 UTC,It can take a while.  I had to go on brisk walks and runs to help get it out. Steam helped me a lot.
stopsmoking,3e50cy,crimsonryno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I'm exercising every day now but never really get exposed to steam.  Normally take cold or slightly warm showers.  You think like a steam room would be good?
stopsmoking,3e2gab,unwashed_masses,5,Tue Jul 21 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"NOPE (Not One Puff Ever) should be practiced.   Whenever I have just one, I am at a pack a week within about a month.  Then I go for ten years before I quit again.  So it is best I not have that one.  Welcome back.    Edit..should be...back to a pack a day within a month"

stopsmoking,3e29b6,jaclynnax,6,Tue Jul 21 12:02:20 2015 UTC,Friends who aren't supportive in this are hardly friends. I'd be pretty disappointed in them.   Co-workers are another story; I wouldn't hesitate to tell them to fuck off. Hah!

stopsmoking,3e29b6,mitchellb1980,4,Tue Jul 21 14:28:00 2015 UTC,Wow. That sucks. Are they like 15?  Listening to that kind of bullshit is what got me smoking in the first place.
stopsmoking,3e29b6,jeanvaljean_24601,4,Tue Jul 21 15:35:43 2015 UTC,Damn! That's hardcore messed up. You keep up the good work. You're doing this for you and not your clique mentality coworkers.
stopsmoking,3e29b6,BendlessLove,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they probably DON'T think you're pushing it on them. What's really happening is they don't think they're strong enough to quit, and they wish they could be. Those of us who have quit know that ANYONE can do it if they want it badly enough. But they still feel trapped in their addiction. It's jealousy. Supporting you is harder for them than trying to tear you down. Because that might mean it's possible for them to do it and that is scary.  It might not be worth it to say what you just said to your coworkers, but I would recommend saying something along those lines to your friends. After that, if they can't see that what they're doing is hurting you, or worse, don't care, I would seriously reconsider calling them friends at all."

If you shove it in my face that you're so sure I'll fail, I only become more determined to prove you wrong!!!  We've got this, no matter what opinion anyone else has. If we fail, so what? That's our business and we'll just try again!"
