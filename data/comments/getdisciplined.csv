You make the choice to read every post, even by people who post annoying things. You make the choice to hold on to that anger about it.

So, it might not be a facebook addiction, but a habit. The habit circle goes like this: Cue -> Routine -> Reward. So maybe your cue for going on facebook is boredom. Then you perform the routine by checking facebook. The reward is that you managed to kill some time.  You can change your habit by using the same cue and getting the same reward by using a different routine. So lets say you get bored again (or whatever reason you go on facebook, I'm just using an example). Instead of going on facebook, make the conscious effort to do something else that will kill time. Hop on /r/getdisciplined or, better yet, read a book on a subject that interests you. Maybe you can go for a short 5 minute walk. Something good for you.  What I got out of the book is that you can't change habits, but you can change the routine that you do when cued. If you're interested, the book is called The Power of Habit.  As for your friend that you chat with just through facebook, maybe you can get their email and communicate that way. If they have facebook, they have email. Or perhaps you can discipline yourself to only chat with them when you're on facebook and time yourself.   I hope that you make peace with your facebook problem.

Now when you see all those pictures and posts you might think that your life is worse than theirs while all they show there is only one side of their life.

getdisciplined,3dypjy,imworkiniswear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"I've always had trouble with one on one conversations, and a better time when speaking to a group. You've probably heard it all before, but here are a few ideas for improvement:   If you don't know what to say, ask questions about the other person, their life, what they've done recently, their goals/plans, their opinions about this or that. Then when they start talking, you just need to keep asking follow-up questions. If you feel like it applies, you can insert a comment about your own experience/opinion, or even offer advice if it looks like they're open to it. If you don't feel like you're interesting, become more interesting(I know..). Not even so that people will think so, just because if you don't find yourself interesting, you're probably boring yourself. And that's no good. Usually I'd say ""get a hobby"", but you had a list of hobbies up there and you have big goals in life, so you can't be completely dull! For the lack of eloquence, honestly the solution is read a lot and have a lot of conversations/discussions. Which is exactly what you're having trouble with, I know.  But if you don't feel up for real life conversations, maybe try practicing in discussion forums, or go somewhere you don't usually go, and talk to people you don't know and will never see again. If talking to people your own age is intimidating, go somewhere where you can talk to older people. It's just for practice, so it's not a big deal if you're bad at it at first. Plus if they're old enough they won't remember how awkward you were :/ Not sure if this is an issue for you, but I always had trouble with random small talk comments from people, I never knew how to answer them. Something like ""this line is taking so long!"" or ""I like your shirt!"". What do you answer to that? One solution is to pretend there was a question ""implied"" and answer that question. ""I like your shirt!"" ""Oh, I bought it at XYZ store!"". If you try to extract a question from their seemingly pointless comment, you can easily find something to say. You just answer the question!   Anyway, good luck!"
getdisciplined,3dypjy,geleiademocoto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Hey man! I've been exactly where you are now and there are a couple of reliable ways to work your way through.  1) Socializing is a skill like any other. The more you do it, the better you get at it. And if you want to get good at it quickly, you need to practice it everyday. Set a goal of speaking to one stranger every single day. Whether the conversation is good, bad, or somewhere in between, you'll start to get a feel for what works. Doing this, I actually made several awesome friends when I was just trying to practice introductions!   2) Asking people about themselves can definitely feel a little bit like an interrogation. A better technique is to follow up your questions with statements! Example:   You: ""What do you do for fun?"" Stranger: ""I really like to surf when I get the chance."" You: ""Oh, well I like to snowboard and heard that it's a lot like surfing."" Stranger: ""No way man! It's a lot harder because...""  This is just a random example, but you see how making statements let's the person you're speaking with build off of what you say without feeling like you're interrogating them. It also leads to the little agreements and disagreements that make dynamic conversations so interesting!  3) Turn conversations deeper, meaning get at the underlying motivations for why people do things. It will create vulnerability, and vulnerability is what creates bonds between people. Example:  Stranger: ""...and that's why surfing is better than snowboarding."" You: ""Well, I love snowboarding so much because it was something I got to do with my dad all the time when I was a kid.""  Stranger: ""I get that. My older brother taught me to surf and it's stuck with me all these years...""  Again, a random example, but you see how turning things deeper gives you a chance to become more intimate with the person and how you can forge deeper bonds quickly!   Any way, the fact that you're working towards this is proof enough that you'll get there eventually. Good luck with everything!"
getdisciplined,3dypjy,mercert,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"As a former hopelessly awkward socializer and someone with social anxiety (diagnosed, on meds now), I feel your pain. Here are three things that I found helped me:   Play a game: I call it ""likable me"". I pick someone I have to talk to--usually a cashier or co-worker or classmate for a group project I'm working on. Now, have a conversation with them! Doesn't have to be long, doesn't have to be in-depth, but the idea is to connect with them. If you get them to really smile, double win. If you get them to laugh, triple win. Sometimes you'll strike out, but don't worry about it. Just try again with the next person you have to talk to. This might be hard for you depending on who you have around you, but I found it really useful to pick someone I knew who was social and outgoing, observe them, and note how they interact. Body language, conversation topics, cadence of conversation, typical responses, etc.  Either read the news (doesn't have to be in-depth) on a daily or bi-daily basis or pick up a popular TV show. Either of these habits will give you some ""common ground"" fodder for conversation.   Regarding this:    I'm a natural cynic and struggle to think positively. Everything in life just seems so forced and I just want to be as sincere and >passionate as the people I'm surrounded by. It just feels like I'm going through the motions, but I can't get my mindset to change.   Have you considered talking to a professional about depression? I thought it was just who I was--stilted, awkward, flat--until I went on meds for anxiety and realized I'd actually been depressed for a long time. Not saying you need meds! Just that you might try going to a counselor or therapist and discussing some of this. Sounds like you've got a lot on your plate; take care of yourself, don't beat yourself up, and know that there are lots of people out there who struggle with these sorts of things!"

Caffeine and melatonin help me control how alert/sleepy I am, while Adderall is only used in rare cases. I mismanage my time and need to get done many important things in a short period of time, or if I've been up all night, I'll use Adderall. Haven't used it in months however because the crash blows and all-nighters are mostly pointless for me to do now.  I mean, its totally possible to manage a sleep schedule without drugs (I don't use them every day/night), but melatonin and caffeine make it 10x easier with not a lot of drawbacks. Right now, there's no point in making it harder than it has to be.   I don't really care too much what happens with weed legalization. I don't think that people should go to prison for using. Other than that I'm indifferent on what happens, though it'd be cool to try it once it's legalized/decriminalized enough."

I repeat it for you in all caps: YOU CAN'T OVERSTIMULATE YOUR DOPAMINE RECEPTORS WITHOUT EXTERNAL CHEMISTRY!

Alcoholics can actually die if they go cold turkey.  The reason why you feel better is called placebo effect and of course your dick will go flaccid if you try to fuck a women after you have masturbated on the same day (probably multiple times...). Hell, I need at least two days before I can fuck hard again after I came. Some guys need even a week. We all have different libidos. You probably have just a low libido and need to slow down the fapping and learn to relax to get a good hard one with a living women again.  We can discuss how porn is bad because it can create an idea about sex that has as much in common with the reality such as the Star Wars movies with the work of the NASA. But this is probability not the reason people go noFap.  Please, for the love of god, stop spreading this bullshit around the web. Do you even realize that you and your guys sound like cult? Superpowers? Really?   Please go and ask a doctor what happens to your mental health if you suppress your sexuality."
getdisciplined,3dxwky,spooky-clinic,3,Mon Jul 20 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"You can't overstimulate your dopamine production by fapping or watching porn. You simply can't. It's not possible without chemical help.  I repeat it for you in all caps: YOU CAN'T OVERSTIMULATE YOUR DOPAMINE RECEPTORS WITHOUT EXTERNAL CHEMISTRY!   And even when you do get too much dopamaine, your brain reacts by just creating fewer dopamine receptors. That's why addicts need bigger and bigger amounts of what they're addicted to to feel the appropriate high.   I'm not a fan of this nofap thing myself. I mean, sure, it takes discipline not to play with yourself when your in the mood, but sometimes I think nofappers believe they'll get super magical powers and reach enlightenment by not touching their dingdongs."

You use that excuse of ""the consequences of success"" to prevent yourself from trying. I myself have the same problem, I can't stand the idea that I won't succeed or be short of genius in something I put my all into, which in turn leads to giving myself excuses to not perform to the best of my ability. There's always that phrase, ""I could have done it if I tried harder"".   Honestly I don't have any concrete advice on how to change this nor do I know if what I stated before is true for you, but I just wanted to mention where I think the root of your problem truly lies."

I think losing touch with reality is the main cause for 'noise', either by either reflecting too much or too little. balance is from stating relevant facts succinctly, then planning for your purpose.  if by 'pure' you mean 'reliably true, unable to be adulterated by outside influences, a rock for the psyche to rely on', i think knowing what you purpose to and your own weaknesses as a whole person is key to grounding oneself in times of stress. i find quotes that aptly describe my bad tendencies usually set me straight. e.g.:   The minute you have a backup plan, you've admitted you are not going to succeed. -- Elizabeth Holmes   now i no longer make backup plans. in shorter, geekier terms:   there is no try   just because a truth is cliche does not make that truth any less valid or relevant (... assuming that it was relevant in the first place).

I'm a volunteer at my local refugee initiative, and doing some good really helped me get out of a funk. Maybe an animal shelter or a retirement home? You can use the next weeks to learn the ropes and still help out once or twice a week after college starts.   Alternatively, try learning new stuff. Nowadays you can learn many languages and skills online, and it can be super fun. Find something interesting/useful (working out? cooking? painting? French? Spanish?) and allot a certain time frame every day to learning it. Work out in the morning, spend an hour learning Swedish in the afternoon, cook a nice dinner for your family. You'll still have lots of free time but at least you'll use some of it productively. Hope this helps, and good luck!"

Do anything - even five minutes of jumping jacks in front of Netflix :)  Reset your circadian rhythms - skip a night of sleep and stay awake until 8 or so the next night. Set your alarm for 8 and get up then. Get up at 8 for a week, going to bed at 10 ( yes, this is a lot of sleep )- then push back your waking time 15 minutes every two or three days until you are getting up at 6 every day.   Go to /r/stoicism and read the FAQ.   Go to Code academy and spend 15 minutes a day learning a new language.   You don't have to leap out of bed at 4 am and run a marathon - just do anything - any small thing - and build your way up. By doing this, you're training yourself to think of yourself as ""someone who does jumping jacks"" or ""someone who codes ruby on rails"" or ""someone who practices moderation and patience"" rather than ""someone who slobs about all day watching Netflix"".

getdisciplined,3dtkxi,0_-,2,Mon Jul 20 04:54:56 2015 UTC,I live in China. It is the safest place you will ever go. Random crime is almost zero. It has some problems but is a great place. Hong Kong is part of China but runs autonomously and has it's own currency so I understand the confusion. Also chinese is a cool language to learn and not as hard as it seems at first.
getdisciplined,3dtkxi,Randythegeologist,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/China/United-States/Crime  As you can see here (if this is right), USA has approximately 2-3 times more actual crime, but the Chinese are 75% more afraid of crime.  So that means the Chinese are 225% more afraid of crime than Americans, according to rough numbers.  So while it might be actually safe, it is a place that seems much more terrifying because of the hyper vigilance against crime. Given that, and the lack of signs in English (I'll never learn Chinese, Classical Latin, Tagalog and Hebrew are taking priority) then that is a very confusing place for a laid back guy.  Hong Kong is kind of cool because they speak English and use dollars, the Philippines has a higher actual crime rate and actual higher level street crime - you always want to be taking a taxi. But it just seems way more laid back when you are at an actual mall or resort or hotel, because the fear of crime is lower.  I just thought I would explain my strange position, because in reality it does have a strong impact on my decisions and there might be people who think like me. I am not sure if you are ethic Chinese or a Caucasian that has chosen to live in China, if you are the latter I think that you are probably rarer, and that more people would go to Hong Kong or the Philippines for the aforementioned reasons, even though you might be right and the crime rate probably is technically lower."

getdisciplined,3dtkxi,Mydria,43,Mon Jul 20 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Early riser here...been doing it since my first job out of college...over 20 years now.  It is such a habit, that even on the weekends, I am up by 5am.  During the week, I am in bed before 10 and up by 4am usually.  I do best on 6-ish hours of sleep; any more or less and I am dragging ass all day.     The main benefit for me is that I get things done before the rest of the world wakes up.  I'll often be in the office at 6am, and 2-3 hours of quiet time before the phone starts ringing and the boss starts calling are my most productive.  I don't do that every day...but at least 2-3 days a week.  Also, if I am running out of gas or have appointments in the afternoon, I can leave work when I need to without feeling like I am shorting my employer.    As for my personal life...well, right now it is 9:40 in the AM.  I have been out in the yard pulling weeds/tending the garden/etc since about 6am...taking a cooling off break right now, it's getting hot and it is damned humid out there.   I have the worst of the work done before the heat of the day sets in.  I'll probably work until around noon, then take the rest of the day off, to rest up for the busy day ahead tomorrow.   I love living life like this.  I spend a lot of time walking in the woods, and the very best time to do that is pre-dawn...or the ""gloaming"" as I like to call it.  Wildlife is most active, wild berries are sweeter when picked in the morning, and I get to the morels before the competition gets out of bed.

getdisciplined,3dtkxi,Erochimaru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"lol thanks :P, and I kinda was too (with the sedative bit) sorry about the late reply, kinda had to fit some time in to answer properly :)  Anyway so Serotonin (5HT - 5-hydroxytryptamine), there are many ways to increase the levels (included scientific name for a reason that'll be explained later on). Gonna assume you have a reason for wanting to increase your levels (stressed, experimentation, depressed e.t.c).  Commonly perscribed drugs (usually perscribed for stress or depression) which increase sterotonin levels are SSRI's (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) which as the name suggests prevents sterotonin from being reuptaken (as quickly), which then leads to increased levels of sterotonin within the brain. It can cause low levels of melotonin Here due to lowering the amount of sterotonin reuptake - which then gets converted into melotonin (basically incase you don't know it helps you get to sleep and regulate sleep patterns - this is why  ""blue light"" before bed is bad as it lowers the sterotonin production). here  5HTP on the other hand is an ammino acid here and can be extracted from some plant's seeds which are in high concentration of it (called - riffonia Simplicifolia here), I think it is just made chemically for supplimentation, like many drugs.   5HTP is also found in many foods, and the body uses vitamin B6 to convert 5HTP, which crosses the blood-brain barrier (very important for the effectiveness of it), when it is broken down, it is turned into 5HT (sterotonin) within your body.   One downside I have with this is increased sterotonin means more of it is turning into melotonin, so I take it a few hours before bed. here I've experimented a bit with the dose (not advised of course but...), so most I remember having was 600mg (makes me super tired), now I have 100mg daily as soon as I've come home from whatever I was doing (work, studying...), and it works great, sometimes I have to have an early sleep (like just a short one) before making dinner because I get too tired. I have a maximum of 200mg depending on how I feel that day (super stimulated in the arvo is normally my trigger to take more).  Anyway sorry about the formatting I tried to include sources, feel free to ask for clarification on anything, or to tell me something I've said is wrong, because I'd rather know :)"

I keep finding myself frustrated with what feels like a lack of progress. The reality is that progress is probably even slower than we think, so it's easy to get discouraged. However, this summer I really started to reflect on the things I've done over the past few years and it made me realize how much progress I've truly made.  The reality is, you cannot change who you are, you can just develop and cultivate who you are. This means that even when massive changes are made, you'll still feel like yourself. I still feel like I'm undisciplined, but these days I'm exercising, reading, meditating, and being mindful every single day. A year ago I yearned to do these things every day, but I faltered. I kept going though, and now when I reflect I can see that I've clearly improved, which gives me the desire to continue to improve more and more."

Just hard, not satisfying. There are those two buttons: the left one slows it down, the right one speeds it up. I always pushed the left button as soon as I felt a little bit exhausted. One day (you know, one of those awesome sunny ones when you believe you can do anything), I stepped on the treadmill and chose a particularly difficult running profile. I even clicked the right button a few times. I was motivated, but also sceptic because I knew the urge to push the left button would come soon. It came, but I resisted. The urge came back again and again, every few fucking seconds. It was horrible, but I desperately wanted to win this time. Suddenly, the time was over. I was so happy that I sped up even more the next time, and surprisingly, it was easier than the ones before... not for my body, but for my lazy ass mind. And it became easier with every time I stepped on that delightfully terrifying device.  The best thing about this improvement is the fact that it spread immediately to other parts of my life. I suddenly stopped procrastinating! I've tried a few other training tools for warming up, but nothing compares to a treadmill. I... I think I'm in love."

I ask because it sounds like you have done some thinking about what doesn't work for you in your life and a good therapist could help you further explore for yourself how you want to approach these issues to develop a life that you want and be the person you want to be. They can also help to get some perspective on relationships that cause us trouble, concern, or confusion. Making helpful, personal changes in all these areas is possible, especially with (good) professional guidance.   I was new to therapy and found a therapist by using psychologytoday.com's therapist search. It took me 3 tries to find the one that was right for me (1 free phone consultation, 1 free 15min in-person consultation, and 1 free phone consultation).  My only regret with therapy is not starting sooner.   I hope this was helpful for you. I don't want you to go to sleep and not wake up.   Know that /r/suicidewatch is a resource."

You stated you don't live with her (even that isn't a bad thing in my opinion if you are contributing to the household) so I don't see why asking someone who has more experience than you for advice is wrong.  You're a doctor but you don't feel like you deserve it because you used your resources wisely? You didn't cheat, so that guilt is also not needed.

It's so much easier to say ""I suck, I'm lame, I'm a momma's boy"", because then you never have to work on yourself to make changes. You have the perfect excuses. You're literally saying ""I can't stop being a momma's boy, because I'm such a momma's boy. I can't stop sucking, because I suck.""    Your mom is partly responsible, because she never forced you to do it on your own, so now you don't get the reward of saying ""I did it! I accomplished it!"" No, your mom did some of it, and you didn't really accomplish it on your own. You (and she) may think she did you a favor, but she robbed you of your chance to succeed on your own, and as a result, you don't believe you can succeed on your own.   So start doing esteem-building activities. Challenge yourself. You can seek input from your mother, but understand that you no doubt fight so much because this is an unhealthy, co-dependent relationship (research codependency). Seek to break free and make your own decisions, even if they are the wrong ones. If you fail, it's YOUR failure. And if you succeed, it is YOUR success.

getdisciplined,3dtmy4,CandidCandy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Boy, this sounds familiar. I push myself a lot and have (technically) accomplished a lot, but I don't feel competent to handle even small problems or decisions myself. I get moody and tend to sabotage relationships with family and friends (luckily I have a very small number of family/friends who have put up with all of this for years and are still around; most people I've known I no longer talk to).  Anyway, I don't have any really great advice for you, since I'm dealing with the same shit, but I wanted to let you know you're not alone. I'm mid-30s too; maybe it's an age thing.  I think your relationship with your mom may be less about you and more of an issue than you think, but that's up to you (and maybe a good counselor) to figure out and decide.  I made another comment a few days ago that seemed to make sense here, but it was more about letting others' opinions influence your mood rather than having to go to others to make your decisions. But I think that a lot of the same issues apply. You don't think that you're capable of choosing the ""right"" option, and that somewhere out there is the correct choice. I think I have this issue because my dad was really opinionated and I got a lot of shit for making mistakes.  And the strange thing is it's not about putting more pressure on yourself to figure out the ""right"" thing to do yourself, rather than asking others. It's realizing that there's no ""right"" answer floating out there that you need to find. There's no correct multiple-choice answer, where knowing the right one will solve your problems and picking one of the half-dozen wrong ones will confirm you as a failure and make you flunk your life. What's a good decision for one person would be a bad decision for someone else, even in the same situation, simply because they're different people, and people need to figure out their own paths. And mistakes and changing your mind and realizing new things about yourself are all part of that, but you can't do any of that if you don't let yourself make the decisions (some of which will be wrong) that lead to all that imperfect nonsense.  Have you even wondered what you'd think and what you'd like, and what opinions you'd have, if there weren't all those people's opinions banging around in your head? I've been trying to figure it out, and it turns out it's pretty peaceful. And fairly surprising.

Now that you are thoroughly disgusted, I wonder if anyone has any input.   So, being a doctor, you must be aware of the possibility that none of this would make any sense to a healthy and normally-functioning mind. Because let me tell you, your life is basically my experience with depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  Same as you, I always felt like I didn't care about anything, didn't have passions or convictions, and was just the weird one in the room (which was completely obvious to everyone). My opinions were always wrong, no matter what; anybody's second opinion trumped whatever I'd been thinking. I went to law school because there was all kinds of pressure and the ever-present expectation that I be something amazing, even though I have no desire whatsoever to work the hours and rub the elbows necessary to be a lawyer.  I fucking hated myself. We're talking the depths of loathing here, the kind of thoughts that I don't think most people are even aware they're capable of. In one memorable instance, I completely lost it and went off screaming at a loved one because they didn't accept my claim that I was the worst person who had ever lived, and was, in fact, worse than Hitler.   I'm sure you've experienced the same feelings, since you say you're ""just a coward and [trying] to fake it to society that my life is going well."" You hit a point where you just want people to agree with you; no one seems to get that the last thing you want to hear is that you're loved and successful and have value as a human being. You want them to say, ""Yeah, what the fuck is your problem, no wonder you feel that way.""  At least that way it makes sense. At least you earned it. At least it's fair.   If you're still reading at this point, maybe I've hit a nerve. Maybe this sounds a little familiar. So let me tell you this: I stopped feeling that way. By the numbers, I've felt that way for over 50% of my entire life; I've spent half my time in this world so far being miserable and suicidal. But none of those days have happened in the last 18 months.   I made the decision to allow for the possibility that I was wrong. I made the decision to let somebody try to convince me. And fortunately, I found a therapist who was willing to take on that challenge. Even though I had come up with arguments and rationalizations six ways from Sunday, she was willing to knock them out of the way and force me to hear other ideas. And when she realized there was more going on, she convinced me to look into medication.  I am not the opposite person now, nor am I the person I felt I was required to become. I am still a person who doesn't want to go out and socialize, but I am not still a person who feels bad about it. I am still a person who can make negative choices, but I am not still a person who feels compelled to self-sabotage. I am still a person who finds it difficult to take personal pride in anything, but I am not still a person who believes it's because I shouldn't.   I never thought it would get any better. I was wrong. Give yourself the chance to find out if you might be wrong too."

It as also at that stage that I overturned 6 years of depression and worked on 22 years of isolation and unhappiness.  Prepare for a life crash course and a lot of text.  Having no girlfriend is a big sore to have. Its because everyone expects you to have one. I'm not sure what your situation is, but there are people called asexuals. They are not as interested in sex as the normal person. I never had more than 3 girlfriends with one lasting a week.  Things that work for me that I think will work for you (1) Try everything and experiment, be a child. Enjoy trying new things. For example I did the gym for years,  found it monotonous. I said I'd do one karate class for the laugh of it. Funny enough I'm still doing karate a year later. Love it.  (2) Read , I started off reading a lot of self improvement like zenhabits and pick the brain. They are brilliant. From this you learn to be introspective and fix small things at a time in your life. Like how to save - there are subreddits here like /r/frugal and ways to cook cheaply and healthily. Reading is very important.  Even reading novels will gradually change you. Start off with the classics. You want a challenge, try cutting your time on tv and internet and spend it on learning as well as reading.  (3) This is the advance stage, After I spent years researching and changing all the things in my life while doing education. I was really successful at this stage but still no job in my life. It was one open wound I intended to fix by completing my education.   It was at this stage that I had an epiphany, why am I unhappy, don't I have enough in my life at the moment to make me happy. There are people in the world who don't have the basics and they are happier. Its called the pursuit of happiness because it never ends, this constant chase for materials and the right partner.  I researched Buddhism, don't know why to this day but hear me out.  I read a book called Buddhism plain and simple. After that I watched all these monks on YouTube,  highly recommend Ajahn Brahm. I watched about 5 .videos when I saw something, they are the most happiest humble people I have ever met. They have no possessions or even materials what I consider basic living. I began to practice. Famous Buddhist said once, practice a little,  you gain a little peace, practice a lot, you gain a lot of peace I started out meditating every few days 10 minutes here and there for about a year. It was at this stage of my life that I'll experiment with something, I began to go to Buddhist seminars and retreats to learn more. The seminar didn't work for me but the retreat that lasted a weekend gave me an immense amount of peace. That retreat was a few months ago. I'm not saying to follow Buddhism as religiously as I do.  But from it, if you practice meditation and mindfulness you will become a way happier person. You can be an atheist or a Muslim but you can still practice it, it doesn't follow a set of beliefs. It just involves you being present and aware of your surroundings. It also involves acceptance of who you are.  I might of rambled a bit. But the ideas are there. You'll never get a clear idea of what will work to make you happy. Everyone is different. Thats why I gave a rough outline of things that should work for most people.   Just read a lot and find what works for you. Experiment.   I hope the above post helps you. If you want any specific  advice, let me know."

Why are you buying these things? try to gather as much information as possible.   Then try to draw some common lines, what is triggering the spending? Could it be replaced by something else? Are you trying to avoid some feelings? Can you face these feelings?   Now you know what to look for before spending money. You know what your triggers are and why you're spending the money. You should be able to take a step back and asking yourself if you really need that thing. You can try apps like Mint to keep track of your spending.   As far a having goals or ambitions that up to you. Could you live the rest of your life like you do know? How will your retirement look like? Do you think you'd want to move up or sideways to achieve a more enjoyable life for yourself? Its all about introspection and knowing what you want. How do you see yourself in 10, 20, 40 years?"

I think my story can be somewhat helpful to you. few years back i study a degree in social science but as much as i like the subject i really don't like the whole study thing so i dropped out and see how that goes. Im always interested in graphic design and i always try to make a lot of stuff for my or others band in my free time then i found a job in a graphic design firm. During that time i took some short course on interior design which is another thing I'm interested. Now i quited my job, had a pretty well established freelance graphic design client network and just got an offer from a university to study interior architecture starting in second year. A little bit late since every other 22 are graduating but I'm glad I found something that I enjoy working on. I might add my family is very supportive this whole process and i couldn't go anywhere without their help.    Back to you. First thing I'll say is discipline is overrated. I do the things that I do not because I made myself to do so, but because I enjoy doing them. I workout because it makes me looks better, I'll feel focused, energized from a workout, I eat clean because it makes me feel better. Figure out what do you like, try shit out, and the second most important thing, give things up. Sometimes you got to let go to get something better. Is the job as train conductor that requires you being on call 24/7 necessary? If you can find another job that gives you more fixed timetable with similar pay then go for it. Find time instead of telling yourself that you have non. As 22 I feel like we still have a long way to go so don't worry too much about having no money just yet. Focus on finding things that you can enjoy doing so you'll never have to work in your whole life."

I use a program called You Need A Budget, and it works great. Just having to write down every penny I spend makes me less likely to impulse buy dumb shit, and also made me realize how much I was actually making a month compared to how much I actually needed to survive. After that making a budget seemed much easier, and after you have a realistic budget you can follow, the discipline on spending/saving is also that much easier. I know it sounds like I'm saying ""All you have to do is do it,"" but that's kind of how it went for me. Just start by writing down every time you spend money, and every time you make money, and pretty soon you'll realize it feels good to keep that number positive. Good luck man."

You say you need ideas and I am sure we can give you some. The important thing is how you look at the ideas though. If people give you ideas, you will need to consider those ideas as if possible failure/rejection is not an issue. Specifically, you will need to come up good habits that can replace your bad habits. To help you, identifying your goals first is a good step. This is a transition from what you have written, because the goals should concern not what you ""don't want"" but what you ""want"".  To set goals in each area, write down this: Purpose, goal, plan.  In the area of health, for example:   Purpose: Have more energy to do things, look better, save money on food, live a longer life, experience new activities Goal: I will run a 5K race within 3 months. Plan: I will follow this specific running routine, I will run Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. I will run together with my dog.    Obviously, you will have to begin slowly and not overwhelm yourself with a complete overhaul of your life immediately. I would prioritize working on the health goals first of all. With the goals comes a purpose. Through that clarity it will be easier to know where you are lacking. Other tools are required to keep you on track. For example, you can use a daily journal to keep yourself accountable.   Also, protip: The reason people become boring in the eyes of others is because they are obsessed with gaining approval. Be aware of this when you set goals. Goals should do more than augment your social status."

getdisciplined,3dqqyu,Smartless,20,Sun Jul 19 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"Imagine that you're somewhere and you see a girl. Not a super hot girl, just...interesting. She has glasses you're not crazy about, and no real hairstyle to speak of, and she isn't really in great shape, but there's something cute and intriguing about her. Like if she just stood up straighter, she'd seem more confident. Or if she took proper care of her hair. Or if she didn't mumble when she spoke, staring at her shoes. When you talk to her, because she really IS  cute under all that...slouchiness, all she can say is that she sucks, she's totally lame, she doesn't have much ambition. Aaaaand...there goes the interest you had. Because that whole victim mentality is just SUCH a drag, it is the opposite of sexy and interesting. Even if she has a killer smile, and gorgeous eyes, and she's as into gaming as you are. It's that whole lack of self-esteem that is like pepper spray, you have to get away.   That's what your post projects - that whole ""I suck. I'm lame. I'm so insecure, I don't know what to do, I'm so lazy..."" and on and on.    Now imagine that same girl. Hair mussed up, no makeup, a few extra pounds - but she's standing up straight. She's smiling at you (and her smile really is awesome.) She approaches you and says hello, and asks you about the game you're holding in your hands. She's played it. She loves her Xbox, and she playfully says she's always looking for someone to completely crush in online games, and she'd love for you to be her next victim. You both laugh. At this point, her bed-head and imperfect complexion don't matter at all. She is radiating fun, confidence, friendliness, and she has not stopped smiling. But now...you are intrigued. There is nothing victim-like about her. She still has the same physical attributes of the woman I described above. But instead of the slouching, mumbling, ""I suck, whatever, I'm lame,"" victim mentality, she has chosen - CHOSEN is the key word here - to rock what she's got and project confidence. That's a person others want to be around.   Step 1 - From now on, you must never say ANYTHING about yourself that you don't want to be absolutely true. ""I'm insecure, I'm boring, I'm lame, my job sucks"" - you're done. That victim language is no longer in your vocabulary. Maybe it was comforting to you for a while, because as long as you're a sad, lame, helpless victim, you can get away with never improving yourself. They are convenient excuses. But as you know, you can never progress if you talk about yourself that way.   From now on, you are strong. You are in control of your life. You have the power to change it. THIS is the language you must use.   Step 2 - Get out of your comfort zone. EVERY DAY. That doesn't mean climb Mount Everest daily, but it does mean saying hello to a cashier,  or smiling at a girl who looks at you, or accepting an invitation out with your coworkers.    You will NEVER progress if you don't get out of your comfort zone. You're a gamer - imagine if you only played the tutorial level, because the real levels were too intimidating and you were terrified of losing your in-game lives. Sure, you'd ROCK that tutorial level. You'd never fail. You'd play just the tutorial, day after day, and you'd always say ""I won! I defeated the tutorial! I can't wait to play it tomorrow and defeat it again!"" Eventually there's no victory in it, because there's no challenge. You feel like crap about yourself because you never push out of your comfort zone, so you never get a chance to feel challenged, and if you don't feel challenged, you'll never feel a ""win"". So start challenging yourself!   Step 3 - Embrace failure. This is hard, but think of it. EVERY time you fail, it brings you one step closer to a win. You didn't defeat your Xbox games on the first try. You died, went back to the spawn point, tried again, died again, learned from your mistakes (that's important), and tried again, until you got it. Well...that's life. Do that with life.   You've got this."

But, there came a point when I said to myself, the only way I'm going to get used to going out and being more social is by, well, going out and being more social. It was terribly awkward at first, and the first couple of times make you wish you hadn't gone out, and just stayed in. But after a few times of actually trying to hang out with the ""cool people"" and going out, you get used to it.   You seem like a pretty smart person, being able to analyze yourself in your post; I'm sure you're pretty good at analyzing others too. Watch them for a while, when you go out to the club, listen to people around you, watch how they act, and try mimicking it. It's part of why the first couple of times are very awkward, you're still learning and getting used to it. But, eventually, you get used to things like small talk: How's your day been? How was work? What do you do for fun? It all seems really boring, but it serves a greater purpose. You don't REALLY get to know someone better, but you get comfortable with them. You get used to shit people say.   I grew up being praised for being ""different""; for being ""smart"", but all my friends thought it was weird. So eventually, it carried on into my adult life, I was used to being different and weird, but it no longer got me praise, it didn't get me shit. So I decided, maybe I should be ""Normal"". I don't particularly like drinking or going to the club or ""hanging out""; I like learning, reading, watching tv, programming, playing WoW.   But eventually you have to decide whats more important to you. Do you want a social life? Do you want a successful financial life? Do you want a secure life? It all boils down to what's important to you. I like being well rounded, I still read and watch Game of Thrones, and nerd out, but I still go out, and have fun with people. You meet interesting people out there.  Sorry if I misunderstood your post, but it seemed like you were focused on the social aspect: being ""boring"", ""quiet"", ""lame"". But yeah,  step one is just getting out of your comfort zone, and getting used to going out. It will suck at first, but eventually it will be worth it.

It's the single best decision I've ever made. Physically, I don't feel like I look any different, but people have been telling me otherwise. I've noticed a difference in the way people treat me (more positively and respectfully.) There's also something strangely addictive about seeing the weight you're lifting increase. I've also noticed that my stress level is drastically reduced, and things don't spark panic like they used to, especially in social interactions. I'm currently enrolled in school, and I've seen an improvement in my grades.  I hate to be one of those people that are like ""going to the gym saved my life,"" because I've seen it a thousand times on this subreddit, but the truth is, thems peoples are right. Start with something simple, there's plenty of good information out there on good starting routines, and KEEP AT IT. Don't go expecting immediate results, either, you'll just discourage yourself.

Not driving and being in a low paying job are also not necessarily bad things, if you live in a dense city and don't need to drive, and enjoy your work.  A lot of your problems are just plain low sel confidence, which can be fixed by gradually building up achievements you can hang your hat on.  Get your drivers licence first. Lessons are usually only about $50 for an hour with a professional. Save up and book a lesson once a week for about 6 months or until your instructor thinks you're ready, and go get your licence. It's not hard, teenagers do it all the time. Today, just look up instructors and book your first lesson.  Once you have a few small achievements under your belt it's easier to go for the bigger ones. Get a few driving lessons done and then look at doing a little exercise at home after work. Then when you've got a few more lessons done and a few weeks of exercising done you might have the motivation to start addressing your diet. Then in a few months when you've got your licence and you've been working out and eating healthy you might have the motivation to casually chat to some of the girls you see looking your way.

getdisciplined,3dqqyu,jelliknight,4,Sat Jul 18 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"...but I know I'm 100% responsible!   The first thing to understand is that your not actually responsible for your own actions.  Free will is an illusion created by the brain predicting its own behaviour. You might thing ""But I have freewill, I can raise my arm look"" but you are doing that based purely on external input of your senses and some internal processing pipeline.  ""Brain read freewill is an illusions. Brain doesn't like the idea. Brain trys to come up with reason to support its opinion. Brain decides on being able to raise arm. Brain predicts that it will raise arm. Brain raises arm.""  You mind is made of multiple components that often disagree and fight with each other.  Once you understand that you can start to work around that. Change your underlying behaviours rather than trying to force yourself to go against them. Find ways to give yourself more energy.  Make a list of goals and notes about them. Books/articles to read and so on. Ways to improve your life. Things you should look up on the internet. There's no point to going ""That sounds great, I should try it"" then just forgetting about it.  Something like willpower isn't some holy virtue that you just apply, after all if you could apply it then you already have willpower to do so. Willpower is a biological process. It has an amount of energy, it can get used up. Also the amount you have will be based on things like how tired you are, diet, level of depression, habit and so on. It's also something that you can 'train' thanks to neural-plasticity, you can actually gain more of it. I recommend reading The Willpower Instinct.  Procrastination is similarly another biological process. You can read about it here, and part 2. There are some books on it too, although I haven't gotten around to reading them (ironic :P).  For dieting I recommend slowly changing your underlying behaviours rather than trying to force yourself on some diet you will hate and likely forget about after a week. Find healthy foods you actually like. I like tortia wraps with vegetarian sausages, salad mix and so on for example. Another idea is pattu Indian vegetarian curries with a salad (make sure you have some salad dressing you like). I'm not actually a vegetarian, but its healthy stuff and tastes good. An important thing is that you can actually be bothered to make whatever consistently and enjoy it. Maybe make several days in one go or prepare the ingredients in bulk.  Wake up earlier. You are probably waking up just in time to get ready for work. Wake up 2 hours in advance of that at like 6am and go to sleep earlier. Why? Firstly there is a bunch of evidence to suggest that waking up early gives you more energy and that early sleep is worth more (supposedly sleep before 11 is worth double). But it also gives you 2 hours at the peak of your mental activity to do whatever shit you want rather than giving that time to your employer (or more likely wasting in on the commute). Want to play xbox? fine. But you might find your more likely to work on personal projects.  Theres also a concept called ""Decision fatigue"" so working on your own stuff before the day has drained you of all your brain juice should help then."

Exercise will improve your confidence, drive, happiness, health, and appearance. Everyone will tell you to lift weights, but there are other options. Running, walking, swimming, biking, rock climbing, playing tennis, ballroom dancing, etc. Find some physically-demanding activities you like doing, and spend a 2-3 hours 3-4 times per week doing them.  Reading will help you become more interesting, by expanding your interests and knowledge. Try to read a diverse set of books, covering all of the major classes of the Dewey Decimal System. If you don't like the physical act of reading, audiobooks are a fine substitute (and can be listened to while exercising). Finish 1-2 books per month, depending on length.

Most people seem never to get the point where they realize they have control over their lives and instead just spend them disliking the boxes they've put themselves into.    You're here now. No sense fretting about the past.  You need to get out of the habit of letting your mind run in circles about the things you don't like about yourself.  It's a horrible trap to fall in to and it happens to the best of us.  Nothing good can come of whining to a mirror that you're a shitty chess player.   Instead, figure out what you like, who you want to be, what you want to do, and take off a tiny bite each day on the trip there.  The thing that's really hard to see from where you are right now is that tiny steps add up much faster than you currently believe possible.  Gotta find things you like to do. I don't care if it's fucking everquest (though that's probably NOT the MOST productive option ;).)  Don't ""get good at it.""  Just do it.  Try home brewing some mead, or hard cider.  For me it's making things.  Doesn't matter what.  Nothing gives my self opinion a boost as much as making something.  IF your reaction to that is ""well that's great for you, but I don't even KNOW what I want to do."" Then that's fine.  THEN your task is easy.  Clear the decks.  Get rid of shit.  Tie up loose ends.  Throw out a bag of garbage from the kitchen.  See if there's a driving course near you that you can get to.  Most driving classes (around me at least) allow you to take the tests through them, which is awesome.  Takes all the headache out of dealing with DMV.  The more waste you get rid of, the more you clear your head and get crap off your mind so you can think clearly about what you want.    Get to the point where you're going to bed knowing that you ""didn't do nothing.""  You've got forward movement.    And above all things, get away from negative self talk.   If you can tolerate cheesy self-help stuff I HIGHLY recommend Jen Sincero's ""You Are A Badass.""  I read a lot of this crap and most of it frankly isn't crap so much as just cheesy.

You are where you are. There is no point in hanging onto the past and hating yourself for all your past decisions and telling yourself what a terrible person you are. This kind of self-loathing in the guise of taking responsibility can also turn into a form of procrastination. It can be very seductive, and we can feel that hating ourselves is part of the process somehow, and maybe redeems our past actions. It's not. Let it go. Use the past to identify how you can do things differently, but otherwise, leave all that stuff behind.

It really is very simple, visit an adult learning center, sit down with someone and talk to them. Tell them what you wish to pursue after high school and to get them to help you write up a timetable with all of the necessary courses you need. Then pay for the classes, and start attending them. Start studying every single day after that, don't fall behind once and always work ahead. It seems overwhelming but it really isn't. Working 1-2 hours a day everyday is a lot easier over the span of a few weeks than cramming 16-18 hours of information in 1-2 days.   And take care of yourself. Really. Pick up books from the library and read, get a gym membership, join clubs and just do anything to get you out of the house and in more social settings. Even getting a part-time job where you work 10ish hours a week would be a good idea. Puts money in your pocket and exposes you to a variety of people. It helps with time management as well.

For anyone below 30-40 and not very overweight a year of effective dieting and training is a decent timeframe to get in great shape (top 10-20%).   Btw type1 or 2 muscle fibers ratio is some bullshit. Its both trainable to a decent extend and when looking at muscle fibers they arent white or black (type 1 or 2) but the majority is varying shades of grey.  Some people do build muscle faster and have less trouble eating enough but everyone can gain muscle at a decent rate.  Its true that females gain significantly less muscle mass but their goal body usually reflects that. Most girls are afraid of putting on too much muscle so its a pretty moot point when discussing how much time is needed to get in shape.

I'm happy you don't believe everything you hear. There are people who don't know what they're talking about on all sides of every issue. I want to make sure you know this isn't magic, and isn't buff with a few workouts. This also isn't super weak but looks huge. This is looks sedentary, not overweight, but is healthy or unexpectedly strong. And it can be seen everywhere. Did you play sports? If you did, did you ever notice that kid who was always giving it his all, but still wasn't improving or only improving as much as those who only gave half the effort. A hardgainer or normal person isn't doomed, but it will take some extra effort/work/time, depending on several factors.  Okay, I think we're combining two ideas here, so I'll break this down into three questions/topics.  -Question 1: On gainers: (mostly called ""responders"" in the science world) The 20% is somewhat arbitrary, and depends on how you seperate and classify groups, and who you're talking to. Let's forget that number for now. I've seen number as low as 7-8% hardgainers, 7-8% easygainers, and 85% normal population, and as high as 30% hardgainers, 30% easygainers, and 40% normal population. Research here is relatively new, and the topic is relatively complex, requiring a somewhat extensive knowledge of physiology. You could easily take a graduate level S&C course on gainers, but I will do my best to briefly explain. I'll link things as I say them. We'll be taking adaptive and cellular mechanisms, and applying them. ""Gains is muscle size are generally paralleled by gains in strength, and losses in muscle size highly with losses in strength. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists between muscle size and muscle strength. While there is an association between size and strength, muscle strength involves far more than mere muscle size... mechanisms associated with strength gains are very complex and not completely understood."" (Physiology of Sport and Exercise, 5th Edition, pgs. 228-229)  Mechanisms of resistance training gains in muscle strength:   Neural   Synchronization and Recruitment of Additional Motor Units - ability for motor units to fire at the same time (how this work is highly debated, there are likely multiple mechanisms at work here)  Increased Rate Coding of Motor Units - an increased ability of a muscle to contract. A fully contracted begins to kill itself, but that isn't going to ever happen to anyone you or I know, because we are too highly limited by ATP for that to realistically happen.  Ability to override autogenic inhibition - we have mechanisms to inhibit exertion. Training can gradually reduce or counteract these impulses  Reduced coactivation of antagonist muscle - If you're doing a bicep curl, and your tricep is also flexing with an equal amount of power, no movement would occur. Reducing activation of triceps muscle would increase strength gain in this scenario. This adaption is likely a small contributor  Changes in morphology of neuromuscular junction - this change has been observed but the mechanism is not understood.  This study is a highly cited (404 citations for online peer-reviewed articles) source with compelling evidence that strength gain can be achieved without structural changes. He has another article that with a compelling argument and explanation as to why it is impossible to have a strength gain without neural adaptations, but that isn't what you're asking.   Hypertrophy (increase of muscle size)   Fiber hypertrophy - muscle fibers' size are increased via a number of possible mechanisms including increased myofibrils, increased A&M filaments, increased sarcoplasm, and increased amount of connective tissure. It is likely to be a combination of these.  Fiber hyperplasia - an increase in the amount of muscle fibers. This happens nearly exclusively in children. It was thought for a long time that at adulthood, the number of muscle fibers one has wouldn't change, but recent research suggests it may be possible in adults. The results are inconclusive however, and the ones suggesting possible hyperplasia in adults only exist in very heavy weightraining. As a note, children should only work out minimally. While they have the ability for hyperplasia, the increased muscle strength caused from an increased number of muscle fibers causes severe joint pain, especially the older they get.  Now, for some sources:  link Research submitted to Journal of Applied Physiology evidencing gainers (they called them responders) or, here's just the abstract  link an article explaining gainers/responders, that is easier to understand.  link A summary of much of the research on hypertrophy. I've already explained a fair amount. You can click on ""Genetics and hypertrophy"" to take you straight to what you may be immediately looking for.  -Question 2: Why do some people work out less than others, but still look buff?  This has a lot to do with body types, and some to do with the mechanisms I've already explained above. There are three body types: Ectomorph (the skinny type), Endomorph (the fattier type), and the Mesomorph (the muscular type). These are genetic differences. The endomorph is an endomorph in part because of his/her ability to more efficiently convert calories into fat (despite popular belief, not all calories are kept), and their ability to store the fat. The ectomorph will have a harder time becoming buff than the endomorph, and a significantly harder time becoming buff than a mesomorph. Now, that's not to say it can't be done. But, it will be more difficult and it will take longer. Often, ectomorphs become frustrated and discouraged, and do not continue to work out. It is essential to encourage these guys. They WILL have a harder time. Be nice, and stop thinking they're making excuses.   Here is a relatively simple explanation. I like it because of the way it talks about responders in relation to muscular response to exercise. I, however, highly disagree with what he suggests to eat. It either lacks detail, is is based on outdated information.  Question 3: People can be healthy/strong and not look the part?  Absolutely. This, like I explained earlier, is not a 1:1 ratio. The only way to measure health/strength is by health/strength markers. In the ACSM health screening, there are 9 factors consistent with every client that is screened. Only 1 of these (obesity) is anything that can be visibly seen. The others are dyslipidemia, hypertension, etc. This is just a fact. You can ask your doctor if you don't believe me.  In response to other parts of your post  Generally, the way you look IS based on genetics. There is even an ideal body weight each individual's body has, which is part of the reason it is so difficult to gain/lose weight (although losing has a significant amount more to do with backed up cellulas mechanisms that cause extra anaerobic respiration during DLAs and aerobic exercise, that quit during anaerobic exercise. It's weird). Most of the population (not 99.9% because children of children, elderly, disease, metabolically sick, etc., but I understand what you meant) CAN get to the point they'd like to be at, provided it is realistic, but how quickly that happens is highly variable.  On two more points  1) Diet. I'm not sure what you've heard or think here, but while I'm dispelling myths, I might as well briefly speak here. Protein consumed has nothing to do with strength increase. I can't provide a link here, because there is zero research to prove this commonly-held myths. Your body does it's own protein synthesis for your skeletal muscles. Protein is very good and very important for everyone and especially for those who exercise. It's use however, is for conversion to energy if, and only if, you are exercising THE NEXT DAY. Generally, a 3:1 carb:protein ratio is recommended for anaerobic exercise and a 4:1 carb:protein ratio is recommended for aerobic exercise. Ask your doctor. Also, supplements. Supplements (ergogenic aids, in the science world) are rarely helpful or do what they claim to do.  2) Athletes and the .1%. 99.9% of the population is frankly, not able to be grouped together like that. Testosterone and GH are highly variable, and structural inefficiency is very common. Only a select few people are build the ""textbook way"". Ask your physical therapist or doctor or anyone in the field.  Does this help to clear things up? You can fact check me if you'd like. Here's an additional source that is over 100 pages and I didn't go through, but am hoping to be accurate: Musculoskeletal Course  E: formatting"

You're still vastly overstating the effect body type has on one's ability to get fit. Even an Ectomorph, after one full year of very disciplined diet and exercise, unless they had a ton of fat to lose in the first place, will start to look pretty ripped.   I'm curious about one thing regarding that study you linked re: satellite cells. They say that 26% of the participants were non-responders who gained 0% hypertrophy. How did they control for diet, especially given that this was a four-month study? They couldn't possibly have monitored dietary intake 24/7, so it's likely they relied on food diaries, which is not ideal. What age/gender were these 26%? I can't find this info anywhere in the study, and frankly, the data seems worthless in the context of our current argument (just how many ""hardgainers"" are there and to what extent, exactly, is it possible for them to gain muscle) without it.

getdisciplined,3dptzn,40dollarsharkblimp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that was my first ever long reddit post. I didn't get in quite right the first time.   I know what an Ectomorph is. You're still vastly overstating the effect body type has on one's ability to get fit. Even an Ectomorph, after one full year of very disciplined diet and exercise, unless they had a ton of fat to lose in the first place, will start to look pretty ripped.   No, I did not overstate anything. I simply stated there were several more factors that you were not considering. When you tried to point out a flaw in one of them, I responded by explaining to you, and then providing you with several links on why Muscle gain != muscle size increase. I think you're still not understanding. Body type has little to do with getting fit, but a lot to do with the way you look.   I'm curious about one thing regarding that study you linked re: satellite cells. They say that 26% of the participants were non-responders who gained 0% hypertrophy. How did they control for diet, especially given that this was a four-month study? They couldn't possibly have monitored dietary intake 24/7, so it's likely they relied on food diaries, which is not ideal. What age/gender were these 26%? I can't find this info anywhere in the study, and frankly, the data seems worthless in the context of our current argument (just how many ""hardgainers"" are there and to what extent, exactly, is it possible for them to gain muscle) without it.   I don’t believe you actually read that article. The age was pretty clearly stated. Subjects were also clustered based on age and gender. Again, stated pretty clearly. More importantly what you missed though, was that the responders were predicted based on a cress-section of their vastus lateralis. You should read the article. I also do not believe we ever argued on how many “hardgainers” there are. You seemed to imply there was no such thing. So, I pointed you to a study with evidence that they were. Here’s two more if you feel like looking at them. Link 1 Link 2   You're also going to need to source your point on diet, namely that protein consumption is only warranted the day before a workout. That flies in the face of everything I know about synthesis and diet in general, so you need to point me to the exact part of a study that says it.   Just so we’re clear here: Protein synthesis is DNA -> RNA -> Protein. I’m not sure how this flies in the face of what you know about synthesis and diet, but they’re completely independent. (Unless, of course, something is really wrong)  But to answer, you’re not going to get a study. This is based on physiology, which isn’t something that a study is looking into. Nutritionist would tell you this, but supplement industries would like you to think otherwise. In the nutrition field (what I’m actually knowledgeable about, rather than exercise, which I only have an undergraduate degree/certification in), we like to say refer to working for the supplement industry as “selling your soul”. We’ll keep it simple and say look here (that first sentence) and here, and know that a) consuming protein increases muscle recovery, but would go to full recovery without it, and b) most people get enough of it anyways.  Consuming protein has a ton of benefits. High protein, low carb diets have one of the highest rates of success in weight loss and maintenance, beaten only be the Mediterranean diet.   Also, you realize that you're disagreeing with pretty much every aspect of the FAQ at r/fitness, a very large and heavily-moderated subreddit that specifically describes the theories you're espousing as ""debunked,"" right? Do you think every moderator and contributor there is just plain wrong? https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq   I’m actually not. These are popular terms to describe body types. The theory of personality and it’s link body type is debunked. The fact that some people look skinny, some people look bigger, and some people look muscular hasn’t been debunked. Body type is the way you look. Working out has to do with the response adaptation your body gives. This is a staw man arguement, but I will do my best to reply anyway.  To clear things up, these are not “3 types of humans”, it looks more like a continuum. You can not try and tell me that every person has the same frame. Average height, broad clavicle, elongated spine and belly muscles, add in some extra GH, and you have a “mesotype”. Trying to state that genetics has no role is wrong. I'm not trying to give excuses for people to not exercise, but we need to cut the ""everyone is the same"" crap.  Edit: Look here for anything related to human nutrition mechanisms."
getdisciplined,3dptzn,Qsquat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"I think this fight is happening because you're stating a lot of things very confusingly. We agree on far more than you realize.  In terms of the protein consumption, you made it sound like protein isn't necessary for recovery. It clearly is. Where do you get the idea that consuming protein is only necessary the day BEFORE a workout? It seems like you meant to say that excess protein is unnecessary. I also would disagree that ""most"" people get around a gram of protein per lb of bodyweight per day, which is the recommended amount. I have to use whey powder to get my 200ish grams, because otherwise I'd be eating two steaks a day."
getdisciplined,3dptzn,40dollarsharkblimp,3,Sun Jul 19 05:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seconding this.  Whenever I properly start working out and sticking to a strict bulking diet, I put on 20lbs in 6 months.  Lift heavy, eat loads, and you'll see a huge difference in 6 months.

It takes a long time to form a habit, research say around 2 months, during which you really need to reinforce yourself everyday and develop discipline. I discovered the X Effect subreddit and found it to be extremely helpful. To develop the specific disciplines you want I recommend two apps, Hours and Momentum. Hours tracks what activities you do everyday so you can visually optimize your time as you go and Momentum is just an App version of the X effect."

getdisciplined,3dptzn,CaptainSirDoctor,15,Sun Jul 19 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"Failure to organize, by far. The more organized you are, the less effort it takes to effectively channel your energy into the right places. Think of how computers used to be, the size of entire buildings. Now you pack 5 billion transistors into a very tight area. It only takes a little electricity to do a lot more computations per second. This is all because of greater organization and various improvements in these levels of organization.  I think this all starts in your bedroom or home. When that tends to start to fall apart and you lower your standards in terms of what smells you will accept, how much laundry or garbage you will allow to pile up, well, your life pretty much goes in the can after that. If a person isn't showering every day, or letting themselves go on their diet, they are done for.  A huge part of basic organization is self respect, even in terms with how you think about things and what you are willing to accept in your mind and heart. Failure to organize there is also a critical disaster, actually I am pretty sure that is how idiocy is formed. An idiot is just a person who accepts impressions from the external world in the wrong way, constantly. And then they react and do or say something based on how they received that impression, and they look like a total idiot, because it's clear they received in the information in the wrong way. Narcissism is a great way to become disorganized in that regard.    Nemesis noticed this behavior and attracted Narcissus to a pool, where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it, not realizing it was merely an image. Unable to leave the beauty of his reflection, Narcissus drowned. Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism, a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance."

In order to be adventurous, I need to be ready for opportunities as they come up: being fit, having flexibility in my schedule, being happy and in communication with people... I train my body and mind so that I am available.  The discipline of going to the gym and meditating and studying is so much easier because I consciously prioritize having an adventurous life.

getdisciplined,3dqikv,puppybandit,5,Sun Jul 19 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"Before reading this, I want to emphasize that if you are getting the things you want done, then do not change your plan because it contradicts someone else's. Everyone works differently. I am just stating what I believe, and I'd be happy to hear all of yours.  TL;DR: Do not reward yourself with physical things. Make a mental note and look at how far you've come.  With that out of the way, I believe that tangible rewards are bad for discipline. Do not get me wrong, I think everyone needs to cherish the small victories, but I feel like it is more effective when it is a mindset celebration rather than ""giving"" yourself something.  When you give yourself a tangible reward, you are essentially training yourself, that if you accomplish X, then you get Y. Like training a dog, over time you will be able to perform X more readily, but all in the expectation of receiving Y. You are creating an unnecessary dependency between X and Y, and if you do not or cannot give yourself Y after doing X, then you are essentially ""untraining"" yourself. Sure, you may be able to do X a few times without Y, but in the long run, you will need to remind yourself of the tangible reward. For example, if you watch one episode of your favorite Netflix show every time you do your workout, you start to become accustomed to the fact that working out implies you will watch one episode of Netflix later. But what if you want to quit Netflix at some point? Now you are making it extra difficult on yourself, because not only do you have to come up with a reward for that, but now you have to find a new reward for working out, and it feels like you are demoting yourself because the reward for working out is not as great. At some point, you may even question, ""If I cannot watch an episode of Netflix after working out, what is the point of working out in the first place?"" Now, presumably, after working out for a while, you will see that the reward in working out has nothing to do with Netflix, and that Netflix was just a step to get there. But I just don't understand why you would take the chance of trying to deceive yourself until you reach your goal.  What I suggest is a mental celebration. From the start, you should have a vision of why you are doing what you are doing. So instead of trying to trick yourself into a mentality until you realize the full benefits of let's say working out, you know all along what you are doing and why you are doing it. When you reach a small victory, like working out for that day, you make a mental note that you made a step closer to your goal. Then, you look at how many steps you've taken since you started. It is not about how many steps you have left to get to your goal, but how many steps you have taken from the start. Each step will feel like a victory, and yet you are not creating a dependency on something else. You are isolating your goal, and that prevents distractions or interruptions from killing the drive (such as Netflix going down, or removing the show you are still in the middle of watching -- which is really one of the cruelest things that has ever happened to me).  Just believe in yourself. Believe you started for a reason. Drive yourself with mental victories, not physical ones. Remember that discipline is not meant for just a time period, but rather it is a lifestyle."

Events knocked me off course last week, and dunked my head beneath the water. gulpcoughgulp!   This following week is the first in many that's going to demand more and more from me. If I am to survive, quite literally, I have to keep pace with it and, hopefully, much more than that, to thrive somehow. So, I have to bring my constitution up to match.

getdisciplined,3dnjlk,DaorL,75,Fri Jul 17 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"Kill your ego.    Remember that it is better to be kind than to be right.   The whole idea of not letting people talk badly about you is flawed - it is an ego-driven attempt to control that which you can never control: other people. Other people can talk about you all they want. There is absolutely nothing you can do about it.   But you CAN control your reactions. You can smile instead of scowl (that takes practice but it is a much better reaction. It puts people at ease if they are trying to help you, and if they are NOT trying to help you, it confuses them.)  You can be assertive without being aggressive. You can let small slights go - they are meaningless. You can be cheerfully grumpy without being angrily grumpy.   Who would you prefer to sit next to on an airplane? The person who scowls, complains, raises their voice, and acts as if everything is a personal affront? Or the person who smiles, rolls their eyes, makes a comment about these damn airline fees, but treats the staff and other travelers with smiles and respect?    It takes some practice. You will have to actively practice being someone you're not, at first, in order to become that person. I used to scowl all the time, and I hated how people reacted to me. All I saw were scowling faces. It was like they saw me, and instead of thinking ""Oh, I should be kind to that woman, she's having a rough day, maybe my smile will cheer her up"" (that was what they should have been thinking, in my imagination), they scowled back, and treated me rudely.   I had to force myself to smile, as a reflex. Someone bumps into me at a theater? I smile and turn to them. Someone in line behind me sighs and moans like it's my fault the bank is busy? I smile at them. Someone steps on my foot? I smile. Because if it was an accident, then seeing me smile immediately diffuses the situation and takes the tension out of it, and I am more likely to get an ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry."" And if it was on purpose, someone being a dick, well it's really hard to be a dick to someone who just smiled at you, and it either turns their attitude around, or at the very least confuses them. But as a scowler, smiling felt weird to me. I had to practice, and practice, and practice. It felt fake, it seemed forced, and it was not at all who I thought I was. But I kept doing it, because it got results. Now it's just reflex - I smile.   Good luck."

getdisciplined,3dnjlk,mike7654,5,Sat Jul 18 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"This is how I have always reacted, but at work, I can't keep it up. :( My coworkers look at any opportunity to bully or criticize me for every tiny thing (non-related to my actual work, but to other trivial things). At first I just kept smiling at whatever they said and tried to go along with it... but it's just really tiring, and I really hate them all because of it. It's really puzzling why they act like that, even though I try to be friendly enough for chit-chatter, but not that friendly as to talk about personal matters. These past weeks I just keep to myself, avoiding others and just cutting off whatever conversation they might try to drag me into, but it doesn't feel right either. I just can't find a way to be assertive in that kind of environment. :(  Is there something you would advice me to do?"
getdisciplined,3dnjlk,wingedspiritus,4,Sat Jul 18 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. That seems like a much different issue! Being bullied and overly-criticized is really demoralizing, and not at all appropriate for the workplace.   Can you give any examples of what they do?   I recommend checking out some books on assertiveness. A decent one is ""Pulling Your Own Strings"" by Wayne Dyer.   You have a right not to be picked on! Adn you have a right to stand up for yourself. There are a few ways you can do this. One way might be to just say it. ""I feel that comment was unnecessary and hurtful. I'd appreciate it if you didn't speak to me like that again."" Be polite and pleasant when you say it, no need to be hostile. They'll either apologize, deflect (""Geez, you're sooooo sensitive, lighten up""), or double down by being MORE hostile.  If they deflect, call them out. ""Please don't deflect onto me, I'm making a simple request. Thanks."" If they get more hostile, again, call them out. ""I just asked you not to make comments like that. What aren't you understanding about my request?"" Again, a polite, even tone is key.     Another technique might be to ask. ""Did I hurt you or offend you in some way? Because I find your comment uncalled for, so I'd like to understand if there is something I did that made you think that comment was acceptable to me.""    If it really continues or escalates, speak with a supervisor or HR rep at your job. That's what they are there for.    All that said, being moody or grumpy after comments or critiques is a kind of victim behavior. People will keep it up to get that reaction out of you. It's like schoolyard bullies, who know that the sullen kid in class will cry, or throw things, if they push him - they'll push him because they want to see that reaction.   So don't give them the satisfaction!  My technique (when I worked a really crappy job and had some co-workers I could not stand) was to get sarcastic. I would channel April Ludgate. I would disarm them with a little bit of sarcasm and weirdness. They'd make their little snide comments, and I'd roll my eyes and smile, and say things that were a little weird but funny, and they'd laugh, and eventually things got (a little) better. (I did end up quitting within a year because the corporate culture was rotten from the top down, and it was a sinking ship of despair, ha.)   Good luck!"
getdisciplined,3dnjlk,dolphinesque,2,Sat Jul 18 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I think you get where I'm coming from. I'm not OP actually, but I felt really identified with the thread title and your post.   Anyway... I think you're totally right on the reactions thing. Now that I think about it, it makes sense why I was often a target for bullies all the way from elementary school up to high school. Reactions... I'm a person who can't openly hide how I feel, especially if I feel hurt or angry. I used to be a crybaby back then, and I have learned to hide it. So far, it had been easier because I learned to surround myself with people who accepted me and didn't try to bully me to get reations of me. And if I ever met someone unpleasant, I'd just stay away. At my workplace, there's no helping that, since I see them daily. My coworkers... it almost feels as if they can SMELL I'm kinda sensible, so that if they know that if they keep pushing my buttons I will eventually break.   So far, it hasn't escalated to aggressive verbal harassment, which makes it even hard to confront them (and as you say, they would deflect and just call me a pussy, literally (one of them as called me such)). Let me think of a couple examples... Okay, even though my schedule is 9-5, it's not really that strict: sometimes I have to come in earlier, and other times there's no problem if I come in at 9:30 (sometimes I have to come in at 11 because of other matters). And my coworkers, who have no relationship with my boss and have no idea of the stuff I do, make comments on the time I'm coming in, or leaving. The problem is especially how often it happens, and the tone in their voices. Sometimes I try to explain, but I'm usually ignored. Now when I come in, I just dash to my desk, ignoring anyone who calls my name. (Or sometimes not even my name, since they have given me a ""nickname"", which I don't feel is pleasant, but not hurtful either, so I don't pay it any heed)  Speaking of explaining, sometimes a couple of my coworkers often ask why I do x or y thing in a certain way (again, NOT related to the actual work I do, just trivial things, such as my clothing, way of walking, my belongings, whatever). I politely and briefly explain my reasoning, and often I get negative responses such as being ""lame"" or ""pussy"". Afterwards, well, I can't help but feel salty. I hate being sensible. As of late, I give a one-liner explanation and end it there (either just go back to what I was doing or change topic), so that I don't give them a chance to push the matter, but sometimes it doesn't work. I don't know, it feels like I'm just ranting... but they give a pretty hard time there, and it's stressing and frustrating (especially because it doesn't have to do anything with my actual duties there!) ):  I will put your advice in practice, and will also take a look at the recommended reading. Thanks a lot . ^^"
getdisciplined,3dnjlk,wingedspiritus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"It is 100% appropriate for you to pleasantly say things to your coworkers such as ""My name is . I don't want to be called (whatever they just called you), or (nickname), or anything but _ (your name). Thanks."" Not harsh, not sarcastic or aggressive, just polite and smiling. It says ""We're all cool here, and I'm telling you what you'll call me."" If they continue with the nicknames, it's okay to say (again, very pleasantly) ""I did ask that you stop calling me that. I think we'd all prefer a workplace where we don't have to deal with childish or inappropriate nicknames. Thanks.""   The same for coming in and leaving. If someone makes a comment, just say ""I would like to suggest that if you have a problem with my schedule, you discuss it with my boss. I won't be discussing it further.""   If they comment on your appearance, or call you lame, maybe try asking them something like ""Do you have children? How would you like it if one of their peers called them childish names?"" Or ""Do you think that's an acceptable way to speak to someone?""   Call them out, politely, pleasantly, gently - but do it. When you shine a light on their shitty behavior, it makes it REALLY hard for them to poke at you and then run back to their dark corners."

As I mentioned before, I always tried to smile at whatever they said and just pretended it didn't bother me, so whenever I got a little serious about anything, they are like: ""Oh, are you upset?"" and politely explaining doesn't help either. It feels like I just jumped from college back to middle school.  Anyway, thanks a lot for the advice. Most people would have told me to just shrug it off and ignore them, but it is really demoralizing over the time. I'm there by choice, so I think I'll jump at whatever other alternative I find (which would be a pity, because my boss is great to work with). Still, I will try to follow your advice to learn how to stand my ground so I know how to deal with it in the future as well."

It's time I show my ego what for :)  EDIT: To add context; in school I used to be bullied and picked on because I wouldn't stand up for myself, and I was socially anxious all the time. It got to the point that during the last year I constantly snapped at every poke. But I managed to control that after I left, I wouldn't get irritated or wound up, I got grumpy however.  Fast forward a year and I'm working at a dead end job by myself and I need to do every role with the stress of working on my college assignments. Feedback from my manager / boss was rare and when I did get it, it wasn't constructive. For example, I was told ""Not to bring my emotions to work, that's for women."" it not only irritated me but gave me a fake sense of entitlement because I complained to my tutor after I left with every detail of the employers unnecessary actions.   Now it seems I'm back to square one where I snap at remarks and get irritated because I'm not assertive. But that's not progress at all. I need to work on myself."

The other is 5-HTP which is a serotonin precursor. I wouldn't recommend taking either without doing thorough research. Then, I learned to meditate by using headspace.com. That I feel is what changed me. I also started reading a book called Don't Sweat the Small Stuff. I used to scoff at self help books, but man did this one change my perspective on things.   I'm known in my family as an extreme grump. They know me as the one who punches holes in walls, gets road rage, and screams at the top of his lungs because the cat is meowing.

I also found that when I get wound up was often due to my own insecurities and lack of confidence.  Learn to know yourself. Moreover, learn to recognize stressful/anxious situations or people who make it so. For example, an acquaintance of mine would constantly try to get under my skin -whether it was bragging about his income or latest sexual conquest. After I realized that I was happy about myself and his life didn't change or affect mine, he no longer had power over me. Once he saw that, his behavior instantly changed and thus, I didn't have to be so much ""en guarde""."

There are concepts that young children do not get, like object permanence, material differences etc...you accept this as true and simply a fact that young children have to deal with; why not accept your own reality as well?  Humans who are young, like under 18, will care more about what other people think and about things in general simply because its just apart of their biology at that stage. As you age, your attitude and mindset changes because your biology changes. You have a short temper, possibly due to your hormones. Accept this.  One way of dealing with this is awareness. Next time you feel grouchy and bark at someone, become aware of it. Maybe not during the moment, but afterwards when you've calmed down a bit. And maybe next time you'll become aware of your mood during the climax of the experience.  If you accidentally bump someone and they spill their groceries, but they're like oh its alright no problem. And genuinely seem like they're forgiving, how would you feel? Like you owe them. But if they are like fuck you asshole and start becoming aggressive, how would you feel then? Like you're not sorry. Be the forgiving person. Its not always a conscious decision though, make it a conscious decision."

It was a really practical, action-oriented list of the exact steps to take to get your shit together, on every level, from organizing, to work projects, to goal-setting. none of this ""white light, fuzzy-bunny, believe in yourself"" BS. It was no-nonsense ""do this, then do that, right now.""   For me, it cut through my anxiety (which had a lot to do with fear of making decisions, and fear of doing things wrong, which led to piles of unfinished work, that were swallowing me whole.) Now I use that system, and it has almost eliminated my stress entirely, and I'm not kidding."
getdisciplined,3dngm9,0_-,-3,Sat Jul 18 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"The fact is that I think you are a bit uneducated. That is what happens when people keep doing things the dumb way and getting stuck in a rut. You say you are self medicating for anxiety and taking pills, to me that means you are taking benzodiazapines:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_long-term_benzodiazepine_use  There are an extremely long list of negative consequences that stem from the usage of such medications including:   Worsening of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, pain, dyspnea and constipation was found when compared against those who did not take tranquillisers or sleeping tablets.   So just think about that for a moment. You're taking a pill for pain, and then taking a pill for anxiety, but the pill for anxiety causes pain. And I'm sure long term use of opiates can cause anxiety.  So is it any wonder that you are having some issues? If you truly understood this then you would not be complaining about it. You would think ""oh, well these pills I am taking are making me screwed up, so when I feel screwed up it's just a consequence of these pills"". There is some security in at least knowing what is causing the problem.  Maybe you have some other problems, like weight. If that is true, then try out the keto diet.   As for being disorganized at work, read David Allen's Getting Stuff Done book and watch some of his Youtube stuff.  If you say you are a mess well think of it this way. Your life is like a garden, it needs constant weeding. Sometimes you have to dig your hands in deep into the soil and find the deep roots of the weeds or they are just going to grow back quickly the next day.  ""Medicating for anxiety"" is a myth. I used benzodiazapines for years and it just makes you a mess, and you feel like you are missing out on life when you are on them.  I say you could effectively use them one every three months, max, and it would be extremely undesirable to do so.    I am just a mess. I want my life back. I want to stop regretting everything. I want do be happy. how do you forgive yourself? how do you trust yourself?   This is just absurd woman-speak. You are becoming overly emotional and therefore irrational. Obviously quitting the pills (by tapering off them slowly and according to a medical schedule) will gradually lead to an improved quality of living. You will have to develop coping skills in the process. Going for walks or hikes to burn off the excess energy, spending time in a dark room with the curtains drawn to reduce stimulus, whatever it takes.   Emotional problems are a chicken and the egg sort of problem. Which came first? Who cares? You need rationality when pills and other crap becomes involved, you can't even begin to address the serious emotional roots of the problem until you cut the pills. That could be years down the road, but you have plenty of life left to live, plenty of time to change and make an impression on people."

The minute your alarm goes off,  get the fuck out of bed before your brain kicks in and tells you you can sleep for five,  ten,  fifteen more minutes.

The problem is people often use naps to make up for sleep that they missed,  then they nap way too long,  then they can't sleep at night... And the cycle continues.   If you can get into REM sleep quickly for a 30 minute nap power that's one thing. But a lot of people aren't capable of that. It takes them a half hour just to get to sleep. Then they sleep 1 or more hours.   The other problem I find with no is that often times you don't complete a sleep cycle for the duration of your nap. So then you wake up in the middle of the cycle,  which leaves you groggy and worse off than if you hadn't napped to begin with."

Cut out caffeine by late afternoon and try to make your bedtime (actually in bed with the lights out) be consistent. Avoid electronics an hour before you snooze, though f.lux and twilight are handy if you sit by a screen after sundown.   I also find meditation is a good way to clear my mind for sleep.

Students in my school go to 9 classes a day, 45 minutes each, with 5 minutes in between.  I ask people if they, in their jobs, are required to completely change their location, sometimes across the width of a football field (and not in a straight line), in 5 minutes or less every 45 minutes.  And if so, when they got there, could they completely change jobs at the ring of a bell (say, from engineering to catering to nursing), perform at their highest level for less than an hour, then do it all over again.  You feel burnt out because you are burnt out.  I'm burnt out too, which is why I just spent a week binge watching a TV show I didn't get to watch because it was on during the school year.  I've been watching the shit out of that show.  That show went off the air in 2009.  That's how long it's taken me to watch that show.

Allow yourself some down time.  Take it from a friend in the trenches, this time is your time and you need to allow yourself this time. As /u/PeaceH said, if you did it before you can do it again.  In the world that is high school, this is what we do.  I came late to teaching from the business world, and this is my best point for relaxing and letting go: unless you go into teaching, you will never again get these 2 months, ever.  Take them for yourself."

You took time off to address this issue. You found a solution to a problem and took action on it. That's commendable.  your me day wasn't a pajamas and Netflix day. You didn't have a lazy day,  you stimulated your brain. I never do that on my days off!   dude,  510 pieces of a puzzle. Holy cow!  Look at how diligently you worked!! And you took appropriate breaks and swam and everything. You know yourself so well and you organize your life so that you get things that need to be done done and take the appropriate breaks to do so healthily. This break from work, breaks from the puzzle, etc. It's a pretty big feat to have yourself personally organized so well.    Now let's examine your failures:   didn't finish 40 pieces.

So when Milarepa arrived, Marpa did not offer him the beginning empowerment. Instead, he put Milarepa to work doing manual labor. This Milarepa did willingly, without complaint. But every time he completed a task and asked Marpa for teaching, Marpa would fly into a rage and slap him.  Among the tasks Milarepa was given was the building of a tower. But when the tower was nearly finished, Marpa told Milarepa to tear it down and build it somewhere else. Milarepa built and destroyed many towers. He did not complain.  This part of Milarepa's story illustrates Milarepa's willingness to stop clinging to himself and place his trust in his guru, Marpa. Marpa's harshness is understood to be a skillful means to allow Milarepa to overcome the evil karma he had created."

It almost sounds like you are using the activity to run away from what is really bothering you (the OCD... the intrusive thoughts).  You know what they say about the nature of thoughts right? The more you try to repress them, the more power they have over you. It's the same with compulsive internet use, video games, overeating, drugs. Aside from the physical addiction, most share the similarity of being used as a substitute, a way to escape something that we feel we are lacking in life.  If I were you, I'd ask myself what the hell I am running from anyway... And make a conscious effort to truly be okay with whatever bubble us to the surface."
getdisciplined,3dia6h,A-Coordinate,18,Thu Jul 16 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"I've tried both and, for me, a to-do list is my preference. My reasoning for this is that things change all the time. Say you scheduled yourself to do something at 5pm and traffic sucked so you got home at 5:15pm, but you have something else scheduled for 5:30pm. It starts to create a sense of panic and when you schedule everything at a specific time, everything feels like an emergency.   You can do a combination of things. I get home from work at 5pm and I'm in bed by 9pm. So I can say ""Okay, between 5pm and 9pm I'm doing to do x, y, and z"". On weekends I'll say ""I'm going to accomplish a, b, and c before noon"". It lowers the sense of emergency of everything and gives you some wiggle room."
getdisciplined,3dia6h,stringsandwinds,13,Thu Jul 16 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"Both- check out the Getting Things Done method by David Allen.  Calendar / schedule is for things that happen at a specific time- planned work, events you must attend, etc.  Set a default reminder of 1 hour at least ahead so you always see things coming and check your schedule in the morning.  Todos are for things that aren't ""scheduled"" but need to be done (whether or not they have a due date).  I use Outlook at work for these.  The GTD method recommends that you create categories for your todos that are based on the requirements of them.  For example, I have an @Internet category where I put all todos that only require internet access (so I could get them done at home, in a coffee shop, potentially on a train, etc).  I have a @OfficeNetwork category for things that require services only available in the network, so I could do them if I have my work PC and VPN access or I'm at work.  I have an @Office category for things that require physical access to the office.    The two oddball categories I have are @FollowUp, which always list a person and a subject in the todo name.  These are items I need to contact other people about.  I also have @WaitingFor, which also has a person and a subject in each todo name- these are things that I'm waiting for people to get back to me about, and I set reminders to check-in if I haven't heard from them.  Long story short- I use both tools, but Calendar is for items that are happening on a scheduled timetable and can't be done before or after.  Todos are things that may be due at a certain time; but, they can be worked on whenever resources are available."
getdisciplined,3dia6h,abegosum,6,Thu Jul 16 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"Use a schedule until your sense of discipline is well developed.  After that, use a to do list.  You have to submit to a process, quiet down to a whisper the daily ""I don't want to do this"" nonsense, and build your willpower muscles first.

Essentially you fill in your day with all non work items, scheduled free time/exercise/eating /relaxation and scheduled tasks or that have to be done at a specific time eg. Drive to work etc.   Then you can see how little unallocated time you have in which to complete your work. And you should be more motivated to spend your time on being productive.   You may want to create a to do list and run that through the urgent&important matrix and then start on your A tasks.  You only mark off space on your unschedule when you have completed 30mins of distraction free work.  It's effective but I think it is important to have your priorities/values/goals decided first so you know what to then allocate your space too.  Listen to the audio book and then browse the book headings to do the actions."

I just know what I need to do, how many hours I have to do it, and am motivated to accomplish everything as quickly as possible.   Something I do, that is somewhat scheduling based, is I make my to-do list and then tick of which things can or need to be done first, if a particular store opens at a particular time or if a task will be more time consuming or less time critical. That's how I mix in a little bit of scheduling but nothing too stringent."

I assign all tasks a priority and due date, and any task that take longer than a day are split into multiple tasks (i.e. if it's a tasks due date, it should be completed on that day)  Every night or first thing in the morning I take the tasks that are assigned a due date of today and put them into my calendar, around the other things like meetings, lunch, etc.   If at the end of the day something isn't done, I'll reassign it a new due date.  In reality due date should be 'date to work on', but that's not the terminology used in most todo lists.  Anyway, it works really well for me and gives me the best of both worlds.  Edit: I also use the calendar exclusively for any multi-day events (e.g. friends in town) or any event where I have to be somewhere that isn't home/the office (e.g. playing tennis with a friend).

So those things are scheduled in that they come in a particular order and I do my best to keep up the routine.  Some things like ""book dentist appointment"" or ""ask mum where my birth certificate is"" live on a todo list, which I prioritize. There is no time set for these, though I've thought about scheduling a 15-30minute window to do all these tiny tasks at once.

It's super awesome for test taking, but not so much for enjoyment reading.   Then you have people like my girlfriend who is a super slow reader. Like, really slow. But when she reads, she digests every little bit and is able to put together a movie in her head while she reads making the book much more enjoyable.   I'm trying to learn to slow read again myself. There's actually a slow reading movement which might be interesting to read about. I'm currently trying to read Brave New World and I'm not very far because I have to keep rereading stuff. It's a struggle, but I'm glad that you're able to read again. It gives me hope that I will be able to as well."

getdisciplined,3dhzcq,PositiveEntropy,4,Thu Jul 16 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"Habits.  I decided about two years ago I wanted to start reading again. I was on a big self-improvement kick. I started with How to win friends and influence people. Which isn't the most engrossing read, but I struggled through it because I thought it would make me a better person. Then after that I needed something to read just for entertainments sake, based on a friends recommendation I moved onto the Divergent series.  I loved the first Divergent book, read the second one in about two days it was so good, and struggled through the third one in about a month. The third one almost derailed my habit it was so bad.  I just added reading into my daily routine. I'd leave my phone in my room when sitting on the toilet in the morning. I got my dad to make me a wooden stand to prop my book up with when eating breakfast. I got a bedside lamp and began reading before going to bed. Those three times quickly became reading time, and I'd look forward to them. Next, as a big Game of Thrones fan I picked up the ASOIAF series. I had a deadline of finishing the books before the new season started. So, I started reading more and more in my free time. Instead of coming home and turning on the TV, I'd sit down and read for hours because I yearned to know what was going to happen to these characters that I'd fallen in love with.  And just like that, I was hooked on reading again. I forgot how much fun it was to dive into these other worlds. And now it is just something that I do without thinking about. When I go to bed at night, I grab a glass of water and my book. It's just a habit. I've got a list of books to read next. Reddit is an amazing resource for recommending good books /r/books, /r/suggestmeabook, etc. etc. I read American Gods by Niel Gaiman. I want to read Neverwhere soon. Started reading the Hyperion series. I've got the first book of Stephen King's Dark Towers series. There's just so many good books. Also, don't be afraid to stop reading a book if you're not ejoying it. Just move onto the next one.  It's so much fun."

I also totally agree with the idea that the internet is bad for your brain. I come back from time to time and leave more disappointed each time.

People would always say ""Read this book, read that book"", but it was mentally exhausting.  Why should this man read books when it felt like he was missing out on life?  After reading the Greatest Secret in the World for 30 days, book reading became the opposite of a mental exhaustion.  It became part of his core self.  The very habit of reading was more interesting than watching Youtube videos.  Again, you're talking about a man who used to sit down and watch Naruto every chance he got. He graduated at the percentage that made the top 90% possible in high school.  Not anymore, every single reading session, words on a pages would be even MORE fulfilling than pixels on a computer screen.  It was the weirdest phenomenon.   This new book reading habit would cause this man to completely delete his Facebook and only visit pages like Reddit to give advice to others.  He tried to tell his girlfriend at the time: ""Hey stop going on Facebook all the time, read more book, it's more fulfilling"".  She didn't listen and eventually their relationship was destroyed.  Now this man separates himself from many other people simply because he's obsessed with reading, and as one can guess, it's almost impossible to reach full mastery of something in a 1,000 word blog.  To master something requires many pages of useful material, different perspectives and continuous application of this in-depth knowledge.  This is something only a book can do.  And it was all started on a tiny seed planted by the book, again, titled ""The Greatest Secret in the World"""

The amount of the isotope can be modeled by f(x) = 346(one half)x and f(1) = 173. What does the 173 represent?   Module 8 is like word problems, here's one I copy-pasted:    The surface area of an oil spill gets 131% larger every day, represented by the function s(x) = (1.31)x − 1. On the first day, it covered an area of 21 square meters. Which function would be used to find the area of the oil spill on the 47th day?   Module 9 is actually suprisingly simple. It's all about probability and everything related. I'm sure if I found the formulas it would be simple:   The probability that a train leaves on time is 0.9. The probability that the train arrives on time and leaves on time is 0.36. What is the probability that the train arrives on time, given that it leaves on time?   Module 10 is pretty confusing for me, it's about sin cos tan and looking at the review, there are a lot of problems with pi in the numerator of fractions.   Where are the x-intercepts for f(x) = -4 cos(x – pi over two) from x = 0 to x = 2π?   Like I said, I have a low D in this class right now, and I've got 30 assignments left.

Logs and exponents are inverses. If you take the exponent of something, and then take the log of it, you end up with the original - like multiplying by something and then dividing by that same thing.   So, exponents. Let's pretend that the human population on earth doubles every decade. One decade from now we'll have twice as many people, one decade ago we had half as many people.   So mathematically, that is (current population) * 2x , where x is ""decades from right now."" If x is -1 then that is ""one decade ago"". If x is -0.5 that is ""half a decade ago.""   If the population was tripling every unit of time, that would be 3x . The 2, or the 3, is the ""Base"" of the exponent.   For reasons which are not obvious, the natural base to use is an irrational number called e, approximately 2.71828.   If the base is 0.5 , you have the ""half-life."" Every time x goes up by one unit-of-time, you have half as much stuff left. So the unit of time is the half-life. Tritium has a half-life of about 12 years, so in 24 years you'd have a quarter as much tritium left (the rest would turn into something else. Helium maybe.)"

My second piece of advice is to do a problem as it is being taught to you. So, maybe watch them solve a problem on the video, and solve it on paper along with them. That way you are not just watching, you are actively learning.    And I agree with those who recommended Khan Academy. It is FREE, and it takes everything in bite-sized pieces, and most importantly, makes you do the problems.

The most important thing is to be gentle with yourself, being hard on yourself will only make the challenge more difficult to face. Be loving with yourself, care for yourself, eat your favorite food, go for a walk in nature and connect within yourself in a self care and loving way. Begin to be clarify what you want to create in your life. I know things seem like the odds are against you and there is no way forward, but if you pay attention to some of the most successful people throughout time the one thing they all talk about is maintaining the vision for what you want to create. (watch some old videos of think and grow rich with Napoleon Hill, or watch Jim Rohn on youtube or any other great inspirational speaker as this can uplift your mood) I know this sounds abstract right now but the first rule of manifestation to be clear on what you want. I suggest writing out your goals and vision for your life. You need to know the ""what"" of what you want, the ""how"" will be shown to you.  The key to creating the life you want is to surrender or open to life as it is now, do not struggle against it. There is always a doorway that is opening keep your eyes open. Use conscious language- it is crucial for you to continue to speak about what you want to have happen rather than saying how things are not working out, how things are so bad etc... I know this is difficult especially when we are suffering BUT positive speech is a practice. START TODAY.  Work with your mind- go on to youtube and watch every positive mindset video. Watch Tony Robbins, Pema Chodron, even try watching the secret (it can be uplifting).   The fact that you wrote this vulnerable note to website full of strangers took courage, continue to cultivate that courage to create the life you choose.. This is how we refine ourself as we age.

We all have pleasure centers in our brains that are activated when we feel we ""achieved"" something. In your general day to day these feelings of achievement are scattered few and far between and we have grown accustomed to having this part of our brains activate from the sense of achievement provided by the game.   Once I realized I was addicted to the 'easy achievement' (which is completely meaningless at the end of the day) I knew I had to find ways of feeling achieved without the games. I took up programming because it allows you to solve problems and visually view your achievement at a fairly regular basis. I guess at the end of the day I just substituted one habit for another but at least the programming landed me a nice job and has given me something to show for my hard work. You're always going to crave that sense of achievement and if you can funnel that craving into something productive and creative you're going to go places. You have great potential. Use it!"

getdisciplined,3deyl2,Acrydoxis,8,Wed Jul 15 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"If you get up for work, then it's not an issue of whether you CAN get up or not, it's an issue of whether you will or not.   I have 3 thoughts.   The first is to see a doctor. You may have a real health issue, such as sleep apnea, that is really affecting your quality of sleep. That is not something to mess around with, so I definitely recommend seeing a doctor.    The second thought is to use every tip and trick people suggest, and get yourself out of bed. There are a zillion websites with a zillion ideas. No caffeine at least 4 hours before bed, turn off all electronics 4 hours before bed (no glowing rectangles), do some yoga, take melatonin capsules, put your alarm in the next room, and so on.   My third thought is a little more ""tough love"" / realist. You already know all that stuff. You already know how shitty it feels to sleep half the day away. But you're CHOOSING (key word) to sleep in anyway. Knowing the consequences. Therefore - the consequences just don't suck enough.   If sleeping in meant someone would pound a nail through your foot, you'd be up. If it meant losing your job, you'd be up. But you don't get up. So...maybe it's just not important enough to you. And that's okay.   So when you sleep in, and you feel like shit, and it's messed you up, and you're bummed out about it, you have to remember that's a choice you deliberately made. So the next day, when your alarm goes off early, and you feel that flash of anger and misery at the thought of getting out of bed, just be mindful of the choice you make. You can turn off your alarm, and say ""fuck it"", knowing you'll be annoyed at yourself later. Or, you can remember that feeling of anger, shame, and annoyance that you feel when you sleep in too long, and how it is interfering with the life you want. And you can grit your teeth, silence the inner toddler who is throwing a tantrum because bed is so comfortable, and you can be an adult and get out of bed. Or, another option is to just sleep in and not beat yourself up about it. Just be a person who hates waking up, and chooses to sleep late any chance they get, and be okay with it. That is a perfectly valid option.   The thing is that the choice is yours. I find that with things like this, they work themselves out. You will continue to sleep in every chance you can, until the mental discomfort of waking up becomes less than the mental discomfort you feel when you sleep in too late. If you keep sleeping in, clearly it's not that uncomfortable, and the consequences aren't that bad. If they were, you'd get up.   The affirmation I learned long ago that helps me is ""I am responsible."" That is a very empowering sentence. I am responsible for my choices. I am responsible for the consequences of those choices. I have the CHOICE to do what's healthy, or to do what's unhealthy. And I have the maturity to deal with the repercussions. I am responsible.   Tomorrow, when your alarm goes off, say this again and again. ""I am responsible. I am responsible."" You may go back to sleep, but at least you do so knowing that there will be consequences, and you are responsible for them. But maybe that statement will be powerful enough to remind you that you ARE responsible! You can choose! You are not a slave to your inner toddler, you are a responsible adult. Whichever you choose, you are responsible.   Good luck!"
getdisciplined,3deyl2,dolphinesque,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"This... really made me think everything over.  I don't think I have sleep apnea, but of course I'm not a doctor to decide. :P But yeah, I should go see a doctor. Thanks for reminding.  I'm already doing all those sleep tricks to improve the quality of my sleep. I used to have insufferable insomnia a year ago because of my depression and side effects of meds. Thankfully, I'm not having any problems with falling asleep right now at all. The only problem is getting my ass up.  What changed my way of thinking was your third thought. It really opened my mind. Actually, in my opinion, consequences of sleeping in are so, so terrible. When I wake up after sleeping in, I just feel awful and always beat myself up because I did the wrong thing.  I think, even though consequences are bad enough for my mental and physical health right now (because of my depression), what makes me stay in bed is depression itself. I just give in to it. When I wake up at 7 am, my depressed mind takes over my rational mind: ""Just sleep more because you don't have to wake this early."" So... I just let depression win all the time.  What I'm gonna do though is repeating that ""I'm responsible."" phrase over and over and over again until I feel so much guilt and pain that I'll eventually have to get out of bed. What you said is 100% true. If I'm not working that morning, waking up early solely depends on my choice.  Thanks for making me see it through a different perspective!"
getdisciplined,3deyl2,dolphinesque,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"Depression is very treatable! And yes, it can make you want to stay in bed. So make the choice to get healthier and talk to someone about your depression. Living with depression is like running a race with a broken leg. Sure, you can still run the race, and drag your broken leg behind you. You'll grit your teeth, and wince with every step, and you'll tell everyone you're fine and you have it under control, and it's really not that bad. And everyone else is whooshing past you, as you hobble, pain in every step. It is interfering with your life, but because you can't see depression, you don't take it seriously, even when it'd really affecting you. Just this sentence:    So... I just let depression win all the time.   tells me you don't take it seriously. That's like telling a person with Down Syndrome that the reason they aren't getting A's in Calculus is because they are letting their Down Syndrome ""win"", like if they just work really hard they'll be able to do Calculus, and it's their fault that they can't.   Get your depression treated. Otherwise you will be dragging a broken leg behind you, wondering why you're struggling so much. A person with depression can get along, but it's really hard to get ahead until you get treatment."

I've had trouble with sleep for many years now, and I've always known it's something I need to work on because I've missed so many opportunities and honestly just screwed my life up sometimes because of choosing to sleep in.  It's something I've wanted to work on but haven't really put in the effort, every now and then I do good for a week or even a month then slip back into old habits.  But the way you put your third point really made me think.  I constantly like to blame my ""tired-asshole self"" for pressing snooze over and over and not getting up even when I have to.  But now that I think about it, it's not just myself in the mornings, I make the decision before I go to sleep to stay up later than I should, or play on my phone in bed, and that's a decision I am making.  Because at no point am I taking responsibility for waking up early, I'm just kind of hoping that I do it right this time.  So I need to really drill into my head the importance of waking up early, and take responsibility and realize if I don't wake up early it's a choice I'm making, and not a failure of a part of myself that I have no control over.  So I'm trying once again to get up early in the AM, god I hope I can stick to it this time because my life is really going downhill.  Thanks for your helpful advice."

I worked in retail for a long time, and had odd shifts at hotels for even longer.   My advice would be to fit in something you enjoy. For a long time, waking up early, setting up my laptop and drinking coffee and reading the news was heaven in the morning. No one to disturb me, and I read the news every day and feel weird if I don't, so it was a good time to do it. After about a year it stopped being the thing I wanted to do. I had a longer commute, so I could listen to news on the radio in the car. It made no sense to check the news, hop in the car, and listen to the news.  Right now, I'm battling with myself. Do I want to read in the morning or write the novel I'm working on in the morning? I don't know. I still don't. So I give myself the choice. I have my book and my laptop set up on the couch and I drink my coffee and read or write.  But maybe you really like walking, and would like to fit in an early morning walk. Maybe you live in a place where this is only a feasible exercise in the summer - that's fine, figure something else out for winter, like learning another language!  I think you get my gist. Whatever will have you bouncing out of bed in the morning because you're so excited, that's the thing you need to schedule in at an early hour. Also try to figure out how many hours of sleep you need and get that amount of sleep."

It's usually healthier - or at least you can control the calories - but it's also cheaper. I find that when I'm in a regular exercise pattern, I cook at home more, so I save money.

getdisciplined,3d96ut,heelek,9,Tue Jul 14 14:07:09 2015 UTC,"This is a tricky one because generally things you are interested in and passionate about don't tend to be boring. However, they can still be hard so let's start there.   My guess is that if a subject matter is difficult for you then you probably don't have a great grasp of the ""basics"". (I'm just basing this off my own experiences, not trying to offend you!) So I'd start there. Peel away the subject, layer by layer and ensure that you have the core concepts down.   Also, you could try changing your learning methods up. If you generally just read from a textbook, instead look for YouTube videos to watch. Or find a podcast. Something like that. Also hearing things put a different way can sometimes make them more interesting.   Always try to apply your knowledge. So many people learn something, can recite it forwards and backwards, but can't give you any real world application. So if this is something you struggle with, try figuring out why the subject is so important.  Also, keep up with the news and technology in your own industry. Things are always changing and being improved upon. New insights make things exciting.   I was in the same boat as you. I studied something that I wasn't passionate about in school but after being in my field for a few years, I'm more excited now about my degree than when I first graduated. Good luck."

Otherwise it will stay very hard. Doing things we don't like and that we don't have really good motivation for is always hard and we want to procrastinate on it.   Connecting with your reasons for studying CS could also help. Just reminding yourself every day why you are doing this. What financial stability looks like for you in the future. The feelings you will get from it.  Good luck!

It's also important to understand the problems associated with the college and university environment, and how they can seriously affect your mental health. There are some fantastic threads elsewhere that target this environment.  While it doesn't specifically answer your question, I'd also like to give some input as someone who is both self-taught and has studied a programming degree, and worked for myself and others for several years, and that would be to be realistic and get hands-on experience as soon as humanly possible.  If you're struggling with studying and working to meet your degree, you're probably going to feel very similar in the future when doing it commercially, with new added frustrations of keeping your boss and clients happy, keeping your skills up to date, interfacing with different people via different mediums, and more.  Studying is slightly different in that you're probably going to be on a higher and more anxiety producing learning curve for a longer period of time, but in a very closed environment. Whereas most entry level programming jobs will have a very steep then very shallow learning curve but are wide open in terms of your responsibilities. But there are also plenty of areas of programming where you'll be put under far more stress and have to learn far more quickly than a university degree. So it really depends on what you want to do after you graduate. Think about what kind of work you're going after and whether they match your strengths and weaknesses.  While I'd never tell someone to give up on their degree, I'd ask them to consider whether it's going to help them, and whether it's the right choice. The best way you can figure this out is by using something you've learned to freelance for someone in a specified timeframe, and get a feel for what coding for other people for a living is like. Even if you just have the basics down, offer a free application/website/server setup/whatever on a freelance site, or on reddit, with the specification that you're a student trying to build a portfolio and learn. That way you'll be forgiven for any mistakes, but also have a somewhat realistic deadline and boundaries."

Now as far as your phone addiction goes, don't expect that you are going to stop spending time on your phone overnight. Take it day by day, week by week. If you are on the phone for over 4+ hours a day doing nothing but browsing useless apps, spend 30 minutes less on your phone the next day, and the next day, and so on.

First be realistic about what you can do. Taking out enough time for sleep, dinner, showering and changing etc, leaves me with at most 2 hours total in my day. Trying to schedule three hours worth of stuff would just end up eating into my sleep time and have a negative overall impact. I plan about 1 to 1.5 hours of stuff in the evening, trying to leave at least half an hour to just chill out (you do need time to just relax). I also try to steer away from mentally draining activities because after work I'm mentally tired but not physically tired. I'm guessing you're the same way. Aim for completely brainless workouts where everything is set out for you and is as simple as possible, like a 10 minute run or bodyweight fitness program. Keep things like learning a second language for your days off.  I used the 'wedge method'. Just start by doing 5 or 10 minutes of whatever you're trying to do every evening. Then gradually increase the time spent. The unnecessary stuff will get pushed into a smaller and smaller time period.  Make priorities. Some days you're going to have less time than you'd like. What are you going to do? Sleep has to be priority number one because cutting back on that is going to create problems everywhere else. If you end up having to work late you're going to have to drop something from the plan, and that's ok.  Something's better than nothing. On the days when you just can't be bothered to do your scheduled 30 minutes or whatever make a bargain with yourself to do something.

If the sun is normally up when you wake up sleep with your curtain open so the sunlight can wake you. If the sun is normally up when you go to bed use blackout curtains or foil on your windows to keep any hint of natural light out while you're trying to sleep.

Some people like to turn off all devices and read before bed, but that doesn't usually work for me because I get too into what I'm reading and stay up to read more. Some people just have silence or have white noise but that doesn't work for me either, I end up thinking too much about something and that keeps me up. I usually just watch an old episode of something that I've seen a thousand times so it's distracting enough to keep my mind from getting excited over anything else but not interesting enough to keep me up, and the computer is set to turn off after being idle when the episode finishes. That time does double duty as my main relaxing time at the end of the day. Figure out what works best for you. You might also find that eating earlier or later might help you to be more relaxed and sleepy at the end of the day.  Make an appointment with your bed and keep it. If you've got things you haven't done when bed time rolls around, too bad, you missed the opportunity. Go to bed so you don't stuff up tomorrow by being exhausted."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,jelliknight,9,Wed Jul 15 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"I work a labor job and have been struggling with not napping/lazing about after I get home as well. I wake up at 4am but get home around 3pm so I have lots of afternoon time but by 4:30pm I'm ready to take a 2 hour nap :( today I just gave into it and did, woke up at 6 and made/ate dinner with the family, at 7 we walked around outside with the dog and after that I journaled and gave myself a pep talk to shower lol my reward for showering was a long YouTube video I subscribe to. I'm staying up later than I normally would like to but the nap must help out in that regard. I think adding in physical activity, after a period of rest, after you get home would be the biggest energy boost and will feel the most productive."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,coffeemeh,6,Tue Jul 14 01:28:11 2015 UTC,I too work a labor job but am temorarily homeless. It forces me to get out of the car and do things until its drak enough to safely sleep later. In fact I'm on a walk right now. Maybe you might want to make taking a nap a hassel (e.g. Putting all your pillows somwhwere else)
getdisciplined,3d6usk,createanewaccountuse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:45:32 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. I work weird hours and when I get home I crash hard. I find if I can force myself to do stuff before the nap I can fight it and push through. If I take the nap I'm done.
getdisciplined,3d6usk,btbcorno,5,Tue Jul 14 03:32:37 2015 UTC,What time do you start work in the morning? It's hard to want to do things after 10-12 hour days. Starting with a workout when you wake up can get that done before you get tired at work and is good for you. Save the high energy free time stuff for the days that you have off  Or coffee. Coffee lets you do anything but keep in mind that it'll hurt your sleep if drank too late and you can become dependent on it
getdisciplined,3d6usk,FlamingCereal,2,Mon Jul 13 23:59:31 2015 UTC,thanks for the response. i get to work around 8-830. 20 min commute. I don't drink coffee :(
getdisciplined,3d6usk,FlamingCereal,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah try getting up and going for a walk/run and see if you like early morning exercise. I love lifting weights early morning and coffee makes waking up early, not necessary but it's sure a kick if you can go with the flavor."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,loggerheader,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:42 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to make your commute into a workout? For instance, run or cycle to work?   I do this now, and it has the great benefit of getting me exercise, destressing me, and also keeping me far more focused. Also since I've got a regular exercise habit I sleep a lot better.   Another suggestion: cut out the tv/reddit stuff and do other things - reading or getting more sleep!!"

getdisciplined,3d6usk,gangbusters_dela,3,Tue Jul 14 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"I like to have a decent workout before work. Nothing too crazy that will leave me exhausted. Lift some light weights and/or some cardio. What I don't do is set lofty expectations during the work week. Some days I want to just do a few sets of weights, others I do a combination of some weights and a bike ride, or I just do a longer bike ride.   I plan for 30-45 minutes of exercise before work and decide what that exercise is depending on what I feel like doing that day. Start off with promising yourself at least 10 minutes of some cardio. That will get the juices flowing and help keep your energy up."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,butter_and_bacon,3,Tue Jul 14 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"My only advice is to start doing whatever hobby/interest you have immediately after walking in the door from work. I do this before I sit down and relax, before I turn on the TV or even take off my shoes. It's the only technique that has ever worked for me. If I sit down on the couch for even 5mins, it's all over and I do nothing productive with my evening."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,createanewaccountuse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:16 2015 UTC,What do you like?  Put it across the room.  Lay down somewhere.  Make yourself comfortable.  Get up and get it.  Sometimes we need to start with simple tasks and simple rewards.  Plan your work.  Work your plan.
getdisciplined,3d6usk,tuttutter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"Vigorous exercise always wakes me up, even when I'm in a post-dinner coma and yawning like crazy. Try doing 15 mins of intervals on a stationary bike (5 min warm-up, 10 secs at 50% level, 20 secs flat-out at 100%, then 90 secs ordinary biking, rinse and repeat) or sprint on a treadmill.

getdisciplined,3d6usk,rockysantiago,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"What can I do to make evenings more fulfilling and productive?   Get a head start on tomorrow, the night before.  Here are 3 things you can do as a start:  (1) Prepare your breakfast in the evening.   I assume the reason why you skip eating breakfast is because of not having the time to prepare it in the morning. Prepare it the night before, keep it in the fridge and just reheat in the morning. (Saves you around 15-30 minutes)  (2) Go for a night swim/hot tub  Working 10+ hour days is very tiring. A good night swim/hot tub will definitely take some of it. (Saves you 30 minutes to an hour)  (3) Wake up early if you can  Imagine waking up just an hour earlier a day for 7 days in 1 month. That equates to more than a week of doing something more productive. (Gives you an hour a day)  Now that's 2 hours more free time."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,SpecialestK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"I would say that habits build upon themselves. For example, when I started working out it became easier to do so because it gave me more energy throughout the day. The opposite can be said for when I skipped more workouts for whatever reason and I became more sluggish and taking naps. Hope my story helps! Also, reading is great"
getdisciplined,3d6usk,blimpsandballoons,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"If you're physically tired, drink coffee and exercise your brain during your downtime! Puzzles, reading, programming, drawing, etc.  If you're mentally tired, skip the caffeine and just start moving. Swimming, lifting, running, cycling. My job wears out my brain (IT guy) so I go on long bike rides in the evening."
getdisciplined,3d6usk,BringerOfDestruction,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"If you make a habit out of exercising, that will simply become routine. I force myself to run before I eat dinner or anything. Try bringing workout clothes to the office and stop by the gym before you go home. Tell yourself that you can't have dinner and veg out until you get that sweat in.  I'm two months into my exercise kick and by now it's really easy. I was sick for a few days last week, and I was actually stressed out when I came home and ate without going on my run."

getdisciplined,3d6476,yellowteletubby,15,Mon Jul 13 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think people say they fear success to mask the truth of what it really is. Selfishness. That's what I did. Once we start to accomplish more we fear that more will be expected of us and we don't want to give up control over the time we enjoy wasting. You can counteract this in three ways. 1. Expect more of yourself than anyone else ever could. 2. Know that people's expectations do not change over night. You need to amass some significant gains before people change their perceptions of you. 3. Master the art of saying no and understand that you are not required to fulfill expectations you have not agreed to. Then you can focus on giving - time, effort and compassion to yourself and others. Don't accept fear, acknowledge it and act against it."

getdisciplined,3d6476,lubblylady,2,Tue Jul 14 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"I like this answer but I don't think it covers everything.  I think for people like me who suffered too much abuse and neglect growing up the main issue is lack of entitlement.  Feeling entitled and entitlement mentalities get a really bad (and deserved) rap but like narcissism, everyone needs to feel a little bit entitled in order to make any real progress.   Believing you're entitled to success can really help you over that hump.   Better start believing."
getdisciplined,3d6476,PervyLemming,2,Tue Jul 14 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I had a similar home life of neglect and abuse. However, when you have no one to model what it is like to be a giving person the end result is still selfishness. It's necessary for you to keep all your resources for yourself. When you are no longer in strictly survival mode, learning how to give is the most effective step you can take to acquire what you need. Giving to others primes them to give back to you, then you have more to give. It's a positive feedback loop."
getdisciplined,3d6476,lubblylady,2,Tue Jul 14 04:45:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know, that seems a bit abstract.  In the moment when you're working at your desk and you start to feel like shit even though everything is going well - that is the issue.  That's when you need to feel worthwhile, like you deserve success, that you're entitled to it.   Feeling guilty about having success. I just don't see it as selfish, although I can understand how it can be framed that way."

Want to quit fapping? Think about your romantic life. Want to lose weight? Get healthy so you can live to see your grandchildren.  That's how I interpreted his idea. It is much easier said than done though. I do think the issue is much deeper than it seems. For example, it IS very difficult to accept any type of success when you were poor growing up and have always been; even more difficult to believe anything different is possible."

The idea that I could be successful is altogether foreign because I have become so used to just losing everything (I can thank my father for that).  While it is important to be generous and give back, you also have to have ""healthy narcissism"" which is a belief in that entitlement to success. What is important for people similar to me to believe in is ""I have had it rough, now is my time to get out there and live the life I was denied.""   It is hard as someone who is used to disappointment and criticism to go forward with anything risky. But I have to try damn it. I deserve something to be proud of!"

I realized that 6 hours is my sweet spot, and if I go over 8 hours then I wake up feeling groggy and horrible. This makes it SO easy for me to figure out when I need to go to sleep/wake up to feel rested, while also not restricting me to ""you need to go to bed at 9pm on the nose"" (even though I usually end up going to bed around the same time every night).  Caffeine pills. I used to be a heavy coffee drinker, to the point where I needed two cups to feel remotely normal in the morning. I swapped them out for a single caffeine pill right when I open my eyes, and I love it. Talk about the ""jolt out of bed"" effect... Even if I wake up slightly tired, I pop one of those, and within 5 minutes my body is 100% ready to be out of bed and get my day going. I've been using them every day for almost a full year without any negative side effects. Highly recommend, at the very least to help build the habit of waking up right away."

If you avoid the addiction, you can use just in the right circumstances.  For example, I only drink coffee when I'm jet lagged, and so I don't suffer as much from it because just a little bit of coffee will straighten me out.

And I would answer yes because that is what I do.  Like I said, this system works well for me, so don't dis it just cause you don't like it.    Edit:  this is what I do with my adderall medication, too, by the way.  I have some days in the week I don't take it because that kinda keeps my mind and body in a ""grateful"" perspective so I make the best use of the stuff when I am taking it.

Be careful of course, some nights I push myself too hard and fall into a dead sleep, and can't imagine having to care for a child in such a state.  Consistency is key and if your schedule permits work as much with the day/night cycle as possible. When the sun goes down limit light exposure from all sources. F.lux and blinds to help.  Log your sleep habits. How often are you groggy? How much sleep do you get on those nights? What do you feel like when you wake mid-dream as opposed to a dead sleep? What things make it easier? What makes it harder?  Your bed is for two things and two things only-- sex and sleep. You never lounge on it, read in it, and never EVER watch an electronic screen of any kind while on it.  Sleepyti.me is a wonderful guide for ballparking sleep schedules. Use it religiously. Find a low-key alarm clock that starts soft and slowly escalated in noise. Alarms that start with a loud sound are jarring.  It's a last resort but meds can help. Start with otc melatonin and remember it is light activated.

If you wake up at the target time a few times you will start to get tired at the correct time. Make sure to work backwards from your ideal wake up time to determine your ideal bedtime. It will be difficult at firat yo fall asleep at the new bedtime, but After a few days, forcing yourself to wake up at the new time, no matter how tired you are, will eventually reset your internal clock.  I took a sleeping pill the first few days about an hour before the target bedtime, because I tend to just sit in bed and will want the get back up to do stuff until I'm tired.

So the way I function is I get dressed and layout for a bit and that's relaxes me because I feel like I'm already prepared for the next day and it's not in fast break style ergo subconsciously completing a goal and disabling the trigger.

getdisciplined,3d5qcv,SolitaryRS,7,Mon Jul 13 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"I've always struggled with this kind of thing, too, so all I can tell you are the things that help me.  (1) Get out of your head so much. Go do something outside, go for a walk, go talk to people, volunteer for something. The best things for me are the ones that make me realize I'm not the center of the universe -- something where I have to help/pay attention to others.  (2) At least in the beginning, it's important to not get upset with yourself about losing focus. The important thing is that when you realize you've lost focus, you just come back to whatever you were doing without judging yourself. Treat it like it's an accident -- ""oh, oops, let me get back to what I was doing.""  (3) Make sure that in the beginning, the things you're trying to focus on are high-interest, low-energy. Like, jumping into playing a really hard piece on the piano that requires a lot of concentration is not a good place to start. Start with a piece you already know or one that's not that difficult. It's going to be a lot easier to focus on and you can give yourself props for doing that. You have to build up the confidence that you can be successful on the simpler things -- this is where you get the willpower to plow through the harder things. Make small goals and stick to them.  (4) Consider trying out different hobbies. People's interests change over time -- getting mad at yourself for not being interested in what you used to be ignores that maybe you could be picking up a new hobby that you would be really interested in right now.  (5) Above all, avoid frustration and anxiety. Just accept yourself where you are. Don't compare yourself to others or an arbitrary standard."

What worked? what didn't work?  -Meditation should be guided (I like the Tara Brach Podcast, 30minute is a nice sweet)  -Exercise - everyday for me, keeps my sleep hygenie intact.  I like weight lifting or go to spinning class  -Ear Plugs ** so key  -Leaving Smartphone Home (I use google fi so I can check periodically SMS/Phone calls in gmail)(get some web app that lets you check SMS)  -Installing Chrome Website Blockers (*StayFocused, *Momentum, **News Feed Eradicator for Facebook) THIS HAS TREMENDOUSLY HELPED  -Snooze google hangouts for 4 hour blocks!  -Really Repetitive Music that is ambient and really long tracks. (William basinski 20 mins long songs )  -Finding right kind of library/cafe that has wifi/power outlets, isn't too expensive, but has good comfortable chairs, and sit facing away from the door, preferably hidden somewhere. (I go to my local school library computer room)  -Pace Your caffiene intake. Used to drink 3-4 coffees a day.  Expensive and waste of time.

Obviously, I'm not doing it now because I'm on Reddit, but that's the problem. Instead of finding something to distract me, when I'm successful, it's usually because I dove right in. You can't wait for the ""motivation feeling"" to come, because it may never come. Once you start doing it, you realize that all of the things keeping you from doing it were all in your head, and it becomes easier to do. But getting started is always the tough part. Not to sound cliche, but ""just do it"" is my best advice. Rather than ruminating and feeling miserable because you're not doing anything, you might as well feel miserable AND do something. Chances are you probably wont be as miserable as you initially thought once you get started. And you'll feel good as shit once you've completed it. With that being said, let me get off of Reddit!"

Establish similar habits for your other work. Make it a habit of always doing work in the same place, AWAY from wherever it is you play games or whatever. Pick out ""work"" clothes, even if it's just for homework and studying. Pick out a favorite pen - put it back in the same place whenever you finish doing work, so that the act of getting that pen to go do work is a ritual that prepares you to do work.

You want to make sure that it is easy to do work on your machine, but hard to do anything else but work.  Personally, I don't game, but I block all addictive sites (Facebook, Reddit, basically every site which is based on the 'infinite scrolling' principle) 24/7 using Leechblock. For these, you use a separate machine. I use an iPad, but you may do something else.  If you want to avoid gaming, you should make sure your MacBook has no games on it, and simply do not install any other browser except the one you use on it. Safari can be disabled using this command in the terminal:   sudo chmod -x /Applications/Safari.app  Use your PC for entertainment only. When you're supposed to be working, take out the power cord, roll it up, and store it somewhere inconvenient.  Make sure you keep a clear line between them: there can be no games installed on the MacBook, just one browser, which is equipped with a website blocker. On the other hand, don't allow yourself to do work at the PC: you'll start mixing contexts again, which is not good. Hope I've helped a bit."

getdisciplined,3d3twi,toothbrushdance,2,Mon Jul 13 11:58:53 2015 UTC,Apply for everything that you are remotely qualified to do. You will learn essential skills on the job or at worst get fired. Be confident you can work hard and get shit done. Before the interview adopt a power posture for a couple of minutes (http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en) and be calm. Worst that happens is you don't get hired which is the same outcome as not going. Be sure you read up on the job you are applying for and the company you will be working for. Display ambition and an eagerness to learn and perform well as well as any core values the company might have.   The most valuable thing you can learn on a job is that hard work pays off.   Start applying!
getdisciplined,3d3twi,Marsupian,2,Mon Jul 13 12:26:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with toothbrushdance.  HIGHS COOL all the way. One thing employer look for is someone who could make them feel good about themselves. A diploma will show that you are able to stick to something and you didn't bail out. When signing stacks of papers sign the last few pages first, employers might check out your consistency so make the good ones last. Ummm, talk to the employees before you apply, ask them what it is they do, was it all they thought they were applying to do.  On the cool side of the pillow, say hi to a bunch of people and work with communication. Cause conversation rules the nation.  With any individual you want to FORM  them. Askin about F- family, O-occupation, R-recreation , M-you get the message across.  If you want to build your body, you got to eat. And always ask God first if this is what He wants. Kinda weird yeah but check with the Man above."

My personal solution was not to buy chips, cookies, and ice cream any more because I would do exactly what you do—come home and eat the whole container. The first lesson in getting more willpower is to reduce the number and frequency of choices you have to make.  The other suggestion I have is to be more specific. You wrote that ""I wake up saying that today will be different."" If that's literally what you say to yourself, it's not actionable. Pick something specific, like ""Today I will walk for x minutes"" or whatever."
getdisciplined,3d5231,DrDifferdange,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:24:56 2015 UTC,I think you have to manage how you deal with your job before you tackle the weight loss. I imagine that how you eat is connected to the stress of work.  What stresses you out about work?
getdisciplined,3d5231,PaosStockOptions,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"You might want to mentally go back to 2012 to understand what was different then?  Did you kind of hit bottom emotionally then and that was a strong enough kick to change?  Basically, if the pain of staying the same overcomes the pain of exercising or going on a diet to lose weight, it will give you enough motivation to change.   So what you can do is raise the pain. When you don't exercise and/or indulge yourself in food, create a consequence to that, like put 5 bucks in a jar. You might also need to have someone that holds you accountable so that you really do put the 5 dollars in the jar.  Then you can also raise the pleasure that you get when you change and exercise. I mean that you should set yourself some specific goals, like exercising 3 times a week and reward yourself when you achieve your weekly goal. The reward could be anything, like watching a film or having some nice time with friends.  One important aspect is to have short term goals. As mentioned above, an example would be to exercise 3 times a week, like Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Write down your goals and schedule the time in your calendar. Make sure you always have some clear targets in sight. Make sure you have targets like ""exercising 3 times a week"" rather than ""weighing 200lb"" as you will then focus on the process rather than a fixed goal that you might not reach for a while.   You also need to track your progress so that you can stay motivated. This is on top of rewards."

getdisciplined,3d0r0n,cappnplanet,8,Sun Jul 12 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"I saw someone else post this. Here ya go:     * Learn to cook. REALLY LEARN. Bake bread every day. Tweak your recipe until it becomes FANTASTIC. Make yourself a hot breakfast every morning. (Bonus: Excellent skill for post-sexytimes.)  * Draw for 10 minutes/day. There are some good internet tutorials. Learn to write with your non-dominant hand.  * Start a blog. Write for 1 hour/week. Or 20 minutes/day.  * Practice public speaking. Toastmasters has great resources online. Just grab an empty room in the library and videotape yourself. Write a 5 minute speech, or give a 2 minute impromtu response to the most recent askreddit question.  * Learn a language - others gave some online resources for this.  * Basic programming - codeacademy and many others available to teach you online. Even if you just spend 2 hours/weekday coding, this will really set you ahead in future opportunities/jobs.  * Basic graphic design. Design a menu for that catering event someone forgot to print out signs for. Design a logo so you know how when you start a kickass business in 3 years.  * Exercise. I could write for hours on exercise. Take dance lessons, or go to the salsa club with free ones. I don't care what kind of dance - ballet/modern/ballroom/whatever. The key here is regular practice. When you're good, your coordination and confidence will show in everything you do. You said you weightlift - that's great. Keep up the good work! I wouldn't worry about tiring yourself out - human bodies are really good at adapting to being really active. Get yourself in fantastic shape this summer. Go biking, running, dancing, swimming AND weightlifting. Or whatever you find fun. Start slow, know your limits and don't get hurt :)  * Learn poi / juggling / staff spinning / other prop spinning arts. Youtube has great tutorials and you can make sock poi or a basic staff for < $5.  * Magic tricks. Get a deck of cards and youtube. My roommate has only been practicing for 2 months and is fantastic. Learn to please an audience. Practice with everyone you know.  * Talk to EVERYONE. The cashier, the girl on the subway, the bank teller. You aren't good enough at engaging people until you're on the phone with your bank to cancel your credit card and end up talking about travel plans in Russia. (My friend is this good. He started by opening conversation with EVERYONE.)  * Watch 2 Ted talks every day.  * Learn shit. Whatever you want - Khanacademy,  * Build stuff. You didn't mention your major, so maybe this is irrelevant. Learn to use basic  * Volunteer. That could be a whole separate post.  * Learn to run events. This is a pretty crucial life skill as well, and most organizations are lacking event planners. Host a dinner party to fund-raise for a charity/One Fund Boston/whatever is dear to you.  * Learn a musical instrument(s)  * Busk. With the dancing/musical instruments/prop spinning and awesome public speaking skills you now have, you should be set to try it out! Check our your local laws - sometimes they require you to have a permit. Even if you suck (which you will at first, but you'll get better), you should be able to break even in a few days in a busy city.  * Garden  * If you haven't already, head over to r/[fe]malefashionadvice and learn to fit clothes properly, etc.  * Your turn. Keep this list going."

You can definitely still get out there and play. What's your favorite sport?  As far as hobbies, have you considered picking up an instrument? One summer I learned to play guitar, and it was a blast that summer and still is. I'm actually going through a pretty rough breakup right now, and whenever I get too down I play a couple songs and it picks me right back up.  Do you have space outside to garden? I used to help my mom out with that and it was a lot of fun. And if you wanted to combine it with cooking, grow some vegetables and herbs and make absurdly fresh food. And I don't know if you'll have a kitchen at uni, but knowing how to cook is AWESOME, especially when you're going to be living on your own. If you really want to get good, try to make either lunch or dinner 5 nights a week, and send me photos of what you make if you wanna show off."

It will be over very quickly, and those who made the most of their time will be much further ahead with their interpersonal skills, networking, extracurriculars, and grad school prerequisites.  More specifically, be the person inviting others to do things -- whether it be study sessions in the library, basketball or volleyball at the rec center, or an informal discussion group for your favorite topics. Make the most of activity boards in your engineering buildings. Also, most professors in your discipline will have plenty of advice regarding assisting in research. You could also create a LinkedIN profile and begin reaching out to professionals in your field of choice. Offer to meet them for lunch or ask them for a 30 minute phone call to probe about their work. People love giving advice, they really do. Also consider branching outside engineering and joining business clubs or A&S science clubs and interest groups to widen your social circle.   In addition, I'd recommend befriending some upperclassmen in your discipline to get the lowdown on the best professors, where to get the cheapest books, and what to expect regarding job prospects/local companies hiring/best career fairs etc.. Regarding upperclassmen, there is an engineering and science fraternity in the US called Triangle that is a great place to meet like-minded men (and women during social events).   Most engineering schools also have a few teams for engineering events and competitions. For side jobs before your internships, a lot of engineering students also tutor in the math center for other undergraduates, or have a part-time job tutoring privately for local high school students (via craigslist or networking) in math, science, and SAT prep."

The great thing about audiobooks is that it doesn't take effort to listen to. When I used to struggle to make myself read books that I knew would help me and this was my way around that.   Start walking, find a local park and just walk laaps. Combine with audiobooks for greater effect. When I catch myself bored at my computer, I'd greb my phone with an audiobook and go walk for an hour.  Meditate. Seriously meditation has been shown to develop the prefrontal-cortex which aids willpower and reduces anxitey. Start with Mindfulness meditation. For 5 minutes a day, sit in a comfortable, but active position (don't fall asleep, or slouch). Begin breathing slowly and focus on your breathing i.e. feel your lungs expanding or the air flowing through your nose. When you detect your mind wandering, just bring it back to your breathing.

That has happened to me in university and electrical college, where you cannot keep up with the material. So if you are in some sort of engineering course I think the same thing could start happening to you. So why not start preparing for that and laying foundations for the next couple of months.  There are plenty of areas for you to work in, I don't see why you aren't excited. I'll actually gain some weight just so I can burn it off again, it gives me something to do.

getdisciplined,3cywxz,Triple-T,3,Sun Jul 12 05:06:49 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I am very sorry that you are struggling with procrastination. It's such an annoying and frustrating thing to deal with. I feel for you. But, on a positive note, you have a big advantage,  that you recognize the problem and want to do something to fix it. Many people are just miserable or keep themselves busy and then have a mid-life crisis because they procrastinated things that are important (dreams, goals )in favor of just urgent things (paying bills, work etc.).   I am actually working on a web/mobile app at the moment that does exactly what you need. It's basically a life/task manager but with a cute character in it, that acts as a life coach. So, it is highly guided and fun/colorful to use. It learns about you and adapts to specifically help you the best it can. It helps to map out your goals and break them down into projects and then tasks. There are ~30 strategies that can be turned on/off that help with overcoming procrastination/productivity. And there is also a journey part where you learn about procrastination etc and explore your own situation to deal with it from a cognitive perspective... like therapy.   The app will go into beta in 9 weeks. I am working as fast as I can!! I can write you when it is done. I think it could help you.   In the meantime, people here have shared some good advice here already. I agree that website blockers can help. Also, you could try setting up a habit where as soon as you sit down at the computer you connect with your goals. Maybe put a sticky note on the screen or chair. Sit down and just close your eyes for 10 min and think about what you want and why you want it. We all have thoughts that can get us really fired up. Also, be kind to yourself. Being critical and upset with yourself when you don't get as much done as you wanted, makes procrastination worse. It's an endless cycle. Remember that being a procrastinator is a state, it's not just your fault that you are in this state, and it is going to take some time to get out of it. So give yourself time. Just focus on small steps forward. Have compassion for yourself. You are suffering and it is not just your fault. It's a complicated issue.   Another strategy that can be very helpful is to schedule time for screwing around. So put maybe 2 blocks of ""do whatever you want online for an hour or game"" or more on your to do list. This has been proven in many studies to help with procrastination.    You say you have goals. The key is to break them down until you get small actionable steps. An actionable step should start with a verb. This alone can be a challenge, if you are not sure how to reach a goal. Ask people for help (in my app there is a community part for this purpose). Once you have your steps, it's all about doing them. Which I know from experience is not easy either. Basically, when we procrastinate there is something about the task that we find aversive or consider a threat. Always. Otherwise we would have no problem doing it. Key is to find out what that is. It's often tied to some deeper underlining beliefs about the world or personality traits. And then you need to work on those things. But also just learning what is the aversion can help us move forward. It's often not that big of a deal once we put it into words. Additionally, you could also try to make the task less aversive somehow. Maybe by doing it with someone else etc.  The next piece of the puzzle is learning that you can do things even when you don't feel like it. It's like a muscle that needs to get trained. To just force yourself to do something when you don't feel like it. It helps to set up a rule beforehand, like this... if...xyz... then I get started on the task. And then you just stick to the rule. A helpful ""if"" trigger an be a thought. A procrastination thought! So when you say something in your head like: ""I feel more like it tomorrow"" then do it now. That thought triggers the rule. Just take time to set up these rules, think about your goals and plan. Plan for procrastination.   I hope this made sense! haha I tried to just distill it to the important bits.   Let me know if you have questions! I hope you will try the app and it will be able to help you!"

getdisciplined,3cywxz,DisciplineDisciple,4,Sun Jul 12 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"You're over complicating the problem in your mind.  The answer is really simple:  get off the internet.  So rather than giving you a whole bunch of information I'll just give you a simple solution to add to your days.  After work, lifting, etc. etc.  don't go straight home.  Go to a busy place around town and just walk around.  I live in a city so I rotate between the area around the mall (less occasional) and downtown.  Have a path set out in your head to take and walk around.  Chances are you'll run into something and something would happen.  If it doesn't, so be it, every single day won't be exciting.  I don't look to buy things btw.  Just a way to get some cardio and maybe talk the shit with random people I know walking around."
getdisciplined,3cywxz,__Imperator,4,Sun Jul 12 05:16:51 2015 UTC,"walk    Very well said. And I'd like to second this exact strategy! After work and workout, I wash up and walk on down to a cafe and just read and socialize with folks. Keeps me sharp, keeps me away from the internet, makes me happy. Win win win. Also, shoutout to /u/platonic_sheep for his comment as well. Uninstalling my phone browser was a great decision. While inconvenient 1% of the time, its a time saver the other 99%."

Wow, can't believe I didn't think of doing this before.  The documents folder containing only data for the applications I'm using, rather than savegames and random shit.  Separate browser profile so I'm not logged into sites I shouldn't be using and with active extensions designed to assist in productivity and minimise distractions.    If necessary, even using the filesystem permissions to block access to movie folders etc.  This way, the divide between a productive space and a ""fun"" space is far greater and it would be far harder to accidentally stray over the line.    Thanks for the idea, gonna go set this up now."
getdisciplined,3cywxz,lagolinguini,2,Sun Jul 12 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"I solved this for myself by going analogue for most of my work.  Instead of starting the day by rooting through emails, checking Facebook, the news and inevitably procrastinating, I go to a quiet spot with my cup of coffee and pen and paper and begin to do some deep concentration. Sometimes I will read my textbooks, or listen to a lecture podcast on my phone.  But basically I attempt to cut out all distractions for a block of three or four hours in the morning.  I then schedule myself a little bit of time to read the news, Facebook, and check my emails around noon. If I happen to procrastinate for the rest of the day, oh well. At least the day wasn't  a total waste.  There is value in pen and paper, my friend."

If you're a CS student like me and can't go analogue, use your uni's computer labs instead of your own computer. I find that I'm able to get more work done as I'm not distracted by the stuff on my own computer, and fell like actually working because the people around me are actually working."
getdisciplined,3cywxz,morganah,3,Mon Jul 13 08:48:58 2015 UTC,"Organizing with a computer is kind of like writing down everything that happens to you during your day. It might seem that you can use this information for something, but really it is just taking up your time. What do you need to keep track of and how will this tracking make your life easier or happier? Are you actually just happier moving and shuffling things around in folders? I love doing this, but I realized the amount of time I invested in this organization didn't result in any kinds of returns for me.   Here's what I do to get off the computer: get away from it. I like the comment from that one guy about doing something around town. I'm from a small town with no shopping really but I take walks without my phone and it feels very productive. I leave my computer at work overnight sometimes to avoid netflix and fake work like organizing my flash drives.   What it all amounts to is that I want to know where everything is so that I can use it appropriately and easily and productively. Using a computer is essentially a virtual storage container that lets you hoard things away. In my experience, throwing these things away never causes regrets in the future. When will I reread one of the essays I wrote as an undergrad? Do I need the ticket stub to that one movie I went to with that old friend? No and no. You're happy never to see that crap again.   That was a bit of a rant."

Instead get a nice notebook and pen and write stuff down. Maybe take it with you on your walks and write down ideas, thoughts etc. If you want a visual reminder on your computer, use actual sticky notes.  The idea is to stop living in the virtual world and embrace the real world. Nothing more real than taking a pen and writing your shit down."
getdisciplined,3cywxz,matholio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"I kinda have the same problems you do and this is what I am starting this week.  In a notebook on the first page I wrote down goals that I want to accomplish in the next year. These goals are easy set goals. No setting myself up for failure by pledging to lose 100 pounds or becoming an expert in a field I have no knowledge in atm.  Some of my goals for this year are: losing 24 kilo (2 kilo a month, you can do this even with the occasional treat) finishing my own website have a exercise routine I stick to have a general daily routine I stick to and then some work related things. most of my goals are focused on routine as right now that's what is holding me back in life the most.   Then I add pages for every month of that year and every month I will write down my goals that relate to my yearly goals.  So for weight I put down lose 2 kg and for my website I've written down to settle on design. This focuses a little more on each goals and what I have to do for it.   Then I write out every week within that year. I write down what I need to do that week to reach my monthly goals.  This week I am working on the design for my website, I eat healthy at least 4x this week and some work related to do lists.  I also write down something positive about the day every single day.   I then when to HabitRPG.com and set up an account.  I made a daily to do list of things I need to do every day like cleaning the house and working on coding. I set to do's for that week like checking up on taxes and general things that I musnt forget to do.  To finish it up I added habits like eating healthy and exercising.   I then set this page on HabitRPG as my default browser window. So every time I open chrome it will default to this page reminding me of the things I set out to do.  The most important thing is to set goals you can reach. If you set the bar to high and fail you will be demotivated for a very long time and run yourself in the ground. If you set goals that you can reach easily then you will feel good about yourself when you reach them and even better when you surpass them."

But your mind needs to get used to the idea of functioning without a computer, so you might have to start small. Build up the time you spend on this over days and weeks. Better yet, schedule it.

Realize computer is an alternative not a solution. You can schedule your time using pen and paper. Meanwhile, using computer will aid you proscatinating because how easy you get side track. Your favorite site is just a click away,  your games has finished download and nicely listed on steam, the latest tv you have download/stream, youtube/stopify and so on. Anyway if I were you, I would reformat the whole things and use your computer for work related only. I have no games shortcut on my desktop because they are tempting to be clicked. I still play some other time but my game is installed on external harddrive. Most of the time the games are outdated and forgotten because it took effort to connect my HDD, find the game folder and launcher.  Aother tip is to have allocated time for your favorite site. I usually reddit before I go to sleep only which most of the time only half an hour because I am too dead tired to read a lot of subreddits. Oh, another thing steer away from deafult r/all subredit and subscribe on a few of fav subreddit. Although most of the time, they are slow but they help you focus on your time on the internet."

getdisciplined,3cxu6p,qubist1,4,Sat Jul 11 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"I am very sorry that you are feeling depressed. It's an awful feeling. But it is quite human. Most of us have experienced it at one point or another.   It is important that you don't try to just ""not be depressed"" anymore. We don't have that kind of control over our minds. Accept that you are feeling depressed. It will pass. Don't be upset with yourself about it, that will just make it worse. Be kind to yourself. There is a reason you are feeling this way. Maybe you are burnt out. It seems like you have worked very hard in the past years. We can't work that much for long. Sometimes we just need a break. But if we beat ourselves up about the ""break""...which it seems like your body forced you to take, then it's not relaxing and healing us. It's making it worse and we will keep needing breaks. So take a break. In your situation that might be hard, but even just a day of not doing ANYTHING and NOT feeling bad about it, can help. I am sure you will be able to do well on the tests without too much studying. It is important you take care of your health.   Focus on things you can control. Focus on actions you can take that will help you. Even small ones. Go outside, take a walk. See someone that you like. Enjoy a good movie. Even if you don't think it will be fun. Force yourself to take actions that will be healing. You have to activate a part of a brain that acts like parent. You ""know"" what will be good for you, don't listen to the depression that just doesn't want to do anything. Force yourself. But the parent should be focused on you feeling better at the moment, not on just studying.   As for the studying, just commit to reading for 5 min. Just 5 min. Then you have to stop. It's all about experiencing what it is like to actually do it. Often, when we avoid something in our head the task gets worse and worse. It becomes harder to start. You can also write down what is upsetting you about the thought of studying, why you think it will suck. Maybe you also have an underlining fear of something. Since you are about to graduate, you might be afraid of what's next. The unknown. Or just change is scary in general. Fear makes us paralyzed and sometimes we don't even feel is as fear, we just notice we can't do things anymore. Figure out if there is fear (with procrastination there almost always is) and what it is about. This alone can sometimes make us move past it. Challenge your thoughts... calm your mind and walk through it why it will be ok. You will figure something out. Just accept the fear and then do your tasks anyway.  I hope this made sense and something resonates. All the best to you!"

Earlier this year I went through a lecture series on existentialism almost entirely in the gym.  If you don't have access to audiobooks that fit your research, taking and reviewing audio notes are another option. I was working an night job a few years ago, and every evening on my drive home I would record notes on my writing that I would review the following day. It's an easy way to stay on top of your own thoughts without having to sit down with pencil and paper.  Without knowing the details of your situation, perhaps the best thing to do at this point is look at what kinds of hard limits you're imposing on yourself, and if those hard limits are the source of your unproductive weekends. Give yourself a reward structure of some kind for your behavior (a day hiking, a new knife, an awesome dinner) so you can focus your efforts towards tangible ancillary goals, and don't forget to stay positive."

getdisciplined,3cwu02,smufty,5,Sun Jul 12 01:44:11 2015 UTC,"You've got to find your own way to work smarter, not harder and most importantly be realistic.  You're not superhuman and this a lot to pack in to a schedule. You've made a lot of progress in the last 6 months so well done. That's a really good foundation to build on. Now you're on your way to getting fitter and you want to change your priorities I would say first cut down the gym from 5 days a week to at the most 4 or even 3 to free up some time for your goals. I know you've said that the 11 hours can't be touched but if you don't adapt to fit in your new priorities you're probably not going to be successful and likely you'll be exhausted and burn out. You can work smarter in your gym sessions of 3/4 sessions to maintain your level of fitness without reducing it too much.  In terms of the goals you want to achieve I would say do them in the order of 1, 4, 3, 2. Reason being number one is the most important and if you don't succeed in that it will push you back. Then doing number 4 will build your confidence which is important in achieving your goals. It comes across in your post that your not very self confident and a bit anxious with social situations. It will be difficult to start being more social but it will pay off and be worth it. You will be a lot happier and it will give you energy for your other activities.  Number 3 comes next because unfortunately you need money from a job to survive and if you kick off your career well it will make it a lot to easier to reach your number 2 goal. You won't be as stressed out once you are established in your career and then you can divert that energy to publishing papers. You've just started in your career so I'm assuming publishing papers can be considered as a mid to long term goal.  I believe the key to being successful is to doing everything in moderation and by doing that you keep your goals in check."
getdisciplined,3cwu02,smufty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I wholeheartedly agree with your ordering of the priorities. Also, you are spot on the confidence issues, being an overweight kid/guy whole my life does take a toll. Even today in clubs I find my mind comparing myself with other good looking guys e.g., this guy is taller and handsome than me he could surely get this girl whom I am trying fruitlessly, it ruins my mood and chances but I can't really stop it from happening.  About the priority ordering I feel they somehow conflict,at least in my current situation. Socializing on the wkends eats away my next day completely as I am come home late at night and then compensate for the sleep next day, I am not sure how good this strategy is. afterall I always end up coming  home alone with a massive hangover the next day, but I am taking it as one day at a time, and hope it talking with people in club/bar will help me with my social anxiety and confidence. I would appreciate any feedback/suggestions on it though.  Also, the reason I can;t touch those 11 hours (8 hours work, 1 hour transport and 2 hours gym) is because I am still hovering around 25% body fat, which is still unhealthy and needs to be reduced to less than 20% (and thus my gym session include a lot of cardio/hiit sessions with some high rep weights), after so many trial and errors I feel I have finally found the program that works for me and is actually stick-able. I do not want to make any changes to it at least for next three months lest I would lapse and ruin my efforts completely."

It sounds like your posters are not just pornography, because you have some personal connection to the characters/shows.  I knew a guy who had posters of generic topless women in his room (I think they were beer ads) and it does come off as tasteless if they are just there to be sexy.  But for you anime is a serious hobby for you right?  There's a big difference between ""she's hot"" and ""she's awesome because she fights evil and has magic powers"" (sorry I don't watch anime...) Even if you decide to reduce the number, don't be embarrassed about leaving up your favorites.  I agree with the other posters saying to find women who like anime or at least respects your hobbies.  As someone who likes games, if a guy had gaming posters up, that would actually be a plus.  BTW, someone in the other thread mentioned ant farms as being terrible (too nerdy or what??)

It's your living space, and your posters make you happy. Why deny yourself something that makes you happy?   I could understand if you were living with someone and they were uncomfortable with the posters, then some compromise would have to be made.   But you don't have to worry about that, you can do whatever you want! :D  Sure, companionship and a relationship are great too, and in that comes sharing who we are with the other person.  You're a guy who loves anime and likes attractive anime women, and there is nothing wrong with that.  I agree with the people who say just find a girl whose interests align with yours. =3 One who doesn't mind the posters and perhaps even finds them really neat.  So don't let the ladies who were calling it childish get you down. Life is too short to conform to other people's desires.   If you take down the posters, do it for you!  P.S.

That's what I did with my favorite ""childish"" poster when I decided it didn't fit the aesthetic of my bedroom anymore, and now it's like a little treat to see when I get dressed in the morning.   Speaking to your TL;DR questions: I think a lot depends on the rest of your apartment. If your place is clean, tidy, and the posters are in (even cheap) frames and hung on the walls in aesthetically pleasing ways that fit with the decor, I wouldn't judge them, whether anime or GoT. If your place is a mess and there's dirty clothes and trash on the ground and posters everywhere hung with blue tack, I'd be more put off. For me it's about presentation more than content: if they come off as art rather than wank material then it's all good in my book.

getdisciplined,3cw40i,Handyturkey,3,Sat Jul 11 12:33:10 2015 UTC,"HowTo Life 101  Plain and simple, you need a system. Life gives you objectives: pass classes, have a clean room, go to work, etc. Your objective is to figure out a system to make all these things happen.  I try to use the setup approach. Do all of the things that indirectly achieve a goal for you. Got homework? Make sure your desk is clean. It's hard enough sitting down to do homework without having to clean your desk first. Make sure your wallet is in the same spot every morning (by your keys, on the counter). Simple things like this all contribute greatly to the goal.  It is all the little things that make the big things easy. You can't drive a car anywhere if it's out of gas.  The problem we run into is the ""I don't wanna"" feeling in our head when it comes time to do something. My brain says to me ""hey, you should do this thing so you don't have to later."" Then I say ""but I don't wanna"" and it doesn't get done. Haircuts, oil changes, grocery store. These are all part of the setup and ""I don't wanna"" often wins.  Every time you encounter an ""I don't wanna"", you have to do it. The more you practice doing it, the easier and more rewarding it becomes. Then everything else is easy. You start accomplishing big goals with what seems like very little work because they're all small setup tasks.  Recap.    Build a system by figuring out all the things that need to be setup in advance.  Look for the ""I don't wannas"" and make sure they get done."

getdisciplined,3csjna,ThatEnglishGent,3,Mon Jul 13 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, ""motivation"" is crap. Often you have to do things even when you don't feel like it. That in and of itself is a skill. And as with other skills, you get better at it the more you practice.  Example: I don't particularly want to do push-ups right now. But exercising is on my list of things I do (nearly) every day. I'll do it. But if I'm really not up for it (tired, have a headache, whatever), I play this. That song immediately puts me in a ""fuck it, I'm doing this"" mood with regards to exercise. Works like a charm every time. When I was starting, every time I managed to exercise I had that song on. Eventually they were correlated. I started using the song to help push me into doing exercises. Now I exercise without it, as I don't need that push - but if I do, it's still there for me. It's a tool. It's just one example - there are other kinds I use, other things to help me along.  Eventually the things you do become habitual, and you don't need anything to push you anymore. I'm not sure how long that takes, maybe two weeks to two months. You sort of program yourself. It takes time and patience (with yourself).  There's a lot more I could say, but that's as good a starting point as any."

Do you often make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring and difficult project? Do you often have difficulty keeping your attention when you are doing boring or repetitive work? Do you often have difficulty concentrating on what people say to you, even when they are speaking to you directly? Do you often have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done? Do you often have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization? When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, do you often avoid or delay getting started? Do you often misplace or have difficulty finding things at home or at work? Are you often distracted by activity or noise around you? Do you often have problems remembering appointments or obligations?"

getdisciplined,3csjna,MaxNanasy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:58 2015 UTC,I can answer a strong 'Yes' to every single one of these statements. Are they actual clinical questions used to diagnose something?
getdisciplined,3csjna,El-Syd,2,Sat Jul 11 01:05:20 2015 UTC,It sounds a lot like ADHD to me.
getdisciplined,3csjna,steffifv,2,Sat Jul 11 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This looks like the Adult ADHD self report symptom checklist (ASRS).  It's one of the main straightforward rating scales that's used (in conjunction with a lot of other stuff) to diagnose ADHD.   The real version is more precise in scoring. If you look at it and still think you identify with all the symptoms, I'd highly recommend talking to a doctor (a psychologist/therapist preferably.)   Also, come check out r/ADHD!"

getdisciplined,3csjna,mhm28,3,Fri Jul 10 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I directly jumped in Module 5 (practical methods). The PDF's do have a module summary if you want a TL;DR. Here's what I think so far... The methods listed sound kinda familiar to the stuff found in various other books on discipline (like the Willpower Instinct) but I think it's a great cheat-sheet, since it gives a quick version of the methods I've read before but could never consistently implement because they were so dense that I'd forget them over time. So thanks OP for the share."

getdisciplined,3csjna,MaxNanasy,0,Sat Jul 11 03:31:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. Are you saying you need a 300 page book or a 4 hour motivational video to help you stop? Plenty of people go cold turkey.

To clarify, I used to procrastinate about work (I was a freelancer) until I got a job. It didn't directly cure anything else I procrastinated about.   I found that once I cut out all the pointless stuff in my life (tv, games, aimlessly browsing the internet), I was sat there with nothing else to do but something constructive."
