Cartalk,3e4733,travman89,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you order the ACDelco part from RockAuto.  It is slightly more than the part you linked to, but I have major doubts about the durability of the no-name part you linked to.

Cartalk,3e4733,Starkeshia,3,Tue Jul 21 22:38:14 2015 UTC,ACDelco is equal to the quality of what they put on at the factory.  Dorman has more than likely cut some corners to get to that price.
Cartalk,3e4733,knucklebone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"usually, it's the box they are in. dorman makes a lot of crap for a lot of OE's"

Cartalk,3e4nbw,FlyBigRgoHome,2,Tue Jul 21 22:42:00 2015 UTC,"I think that's the year that had a lot of AC issues. I think a class action lawsuit occurred.  I would check into that first.  Also you can do the work but know to change all filters. Also when the compressor fails it may have contained the entire system, watch out for that. Also have a profession recharge it. Good luck!"
Cartalk,3e4nbw,Revslowmo,2,Tue Jul 21 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"Is this something I could replace on my own or is a professional required?   While you could stumble through a physical replacement.....no, you can't do this yourself.  It takes tools, equipment and knowledge to properly repair AC.  Even if you get it working again there is every possibility that you will do more damage to the system in the long run if everything wasn't done properly.  It's a lot to know, and a lot of tools to have.   One more thing, when I checked the AC low pressure gauge, it read >200psi at 95degree ambient temp. Is this safe to drive with until the repair is made?   Turn off the AC, don't use defrost.  Or just unplug the compressor clutch."
Cartalk,3e4nbw,TrouserPudding,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"My dad and I did this, but my dad is a licensed A/C technician and has all the tools and equipment to make it possible.    I got damn lucky and found a guy selling a used AC compressor on Ebay for $50.  I bought it and it came in one of those USPS one rate boxes (beat to death) and wrapped in a couple of shopping bags.  My dad saw it and said ""No way in hell it works.""  I bolted it on and we evacuated the system, recharged and ... cold air.  He was impressed and I was very thankful.    Anyway, you need the machine to evacuate/purge the system and then you can recharge it using a manifold gauge set, assuming the compressor failure didn't throw a bunch of trash in the refrigerant lines.    200 PSI seems really high for the low pressure side.  That's more of a high side reading."
Cartalk,3e4nbw,FaithfulTexian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:22:24 2015 UTC,Let's say it did - a dying compressor shreds itself throughout the whole system. Is it at all reasonable to try to completely rebuild a system and have a professional fill / charge it?   I know almost nobody does this and I'm certain there's a reason why... So what would it be?
Cartalk,3e3cw5,Homerpaintbucket,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"The reason the heat came out cool is that there was a big air bubble, and coolant wasn't getting to the heater core.   As long as you didn't drive it much while overheating it should be fine."
Cartalk,3e3cw5,IronSlanginRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:57 2015 UTC,so just keep adding more and more fluid until it starts blowing out heat and the engine stays cool?
Cartalk,3e3cw5,IronSlanginRed,12,Tue Jul 21 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"no, bleed the system correctly.  With the car cold, open the radiator cap. Start the car. Turn the heat to full blast to open the diverter, top off the coolant in the radiator, rev up to 2,000ish rpm and let drop to idle slowly a couple times, keep topping off the radiator until no more bubbles come out. The coolant level should drop as it revs up and pulls coolant, then go back up as you let it back down, so do it slowly so it doesn't spill everywhere. Once the car is to operating temperature top off the radiator and put the cap on. Make sure your overflow is full to the hot mark. As it cools down it should pull fluid from the overflow and be good to go."

Cartalk,3e3dkv,Bananas_n_Pajamas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:50 2015 UTC,I would be concerned with the possibility of the sealant completely blocking the plastic tube. Wrapping it with tape may be a better solution.
Cartalk,3e3dkv,Flowmaster44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:41 2015 UTC,The sealant is a thick glue type substance so I'd really have to jam it in there to get that to happen.
Cartalk,3e3dkv,ikidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"Can you get that Mighty Fixit tape on it?  I've used it to keep pressure in a rad hose, I'm sure it would keep that vap line sealed."
Cartalk,3e3dkv,ikidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:24 2015 UTC,That's what I wanted originally but the space is quite small so I might not sure if I could wrap the tape around tightly. I'll probably give it a go after the sealant dries just for extra measure.   I do worry about it passing emissions since they look for any physical modifications (i.e. tape) to the systems. We'll see what happens I guess  Do you know where I can buy that tape though?  EDIT: Found it. Walmart has everything
Cartalk,3e3dkv,nobodyhasthisone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:55:48 2015 UTC,Can you slip some heatshrink over one end or snip it and put in a butt connector?
Cartalk,3e427e,EbirdLS1,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:44 2015 UTC,I did this conversion on a diesel (TDI) Volkswagen Golf and I would do it again if I'd have to. A single mass flywheel will last for the life of the vehicle and the car wasn't really that much noisier. You will only notice it when the engine is idling and the transmission is in neutral.
Cartalk,3e2t50,oipunk99,4,Tue Jul 21 14:59:41 2015 UTC,Leave it alone or wipe with a clean cloth.  Belts have lubricants built in so they DON'T squeak. Degreasing is about as bad as you can get.    CRC dry silicone spray is your best bet.
Cartalk,3e2t50,corporaterebel,2,Tue Jul 21 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Remove the belt and spray pulleys with brake cleaner.   If put on a new belt also.
Cartalk,3e2t50,SayWhatIsABigW,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, brake clean does a great job of this. I do it everytime i change a belt. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to get a brush in there and scrub off the dirt first."
Cartalk,3e2t50,IronSlanginRed,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"I certainly would not recommend getting a wire brush type tooth brush, and I would certainly not recommend you start the car and ""brush"" the top and bottom side of the belt.   Cause that's dangerous."

Cartalk,3e30ew,win_the_day_go_ducks,3,Tue Jul 21 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue on my Forester and it turned out to be the CV axle. I pulled it all apart and the bearing still spun smoothly. The CV boot was torn and the joint was toast. This caused a wobble feeling which was worse when turning left (driver side was bad), but when I backed off the throttle it would mostly go away.  If it had been the bearing, then I suspect it wouldn't have gone away when throttle was removed."
Cartalk,3e30ew,SirDigbyChknCaesar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:04 2015 UTC,Had a very similar issue.  Turned out to be the axel too.
Cartalk,3e30ew,sachmet43,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Just because the wheel bearing bis tight doesn't mean it won't make noise. From your description it definitely sounds like your bearing especially since it makes more noise while turning. This is a hub style bearing I believe so you can replace it your self if you have some mechanical experience edit: not a hub style read it as a subaru for some reason. This is a press in/out bearing, unless you have access to a shop press you will need to take it into a shop"
Cartalk,3e30ew,brifino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, it's your wheel bearing(ex-mechanic who has diagnosed and replaced many). Sometimes it's very difficult to differentiate between tire noise and bearing noise, but the give away for me is the change in sound when you turn. If you can remove the axle from the hub, you can try rotating the hub by hand and get a true feel for the condition of the bearing."
Cartalk,3e30ew,Bendystrings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:08 2015 UTC,Check your tire?  Rotate it to another position and see if the noise changes location.
Cartalk,3e30ew,patterned,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Just had them rotated a couple of days ago in hopes that was it. Sadly did not fix it.
Cartalk,3e30ew,elislider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"Hard to say without removing the axle from the hub, spinning the bearing free (with no axle) and then inspecting the axle separately."
Cartalk,3e30ew,cptboring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like a bearing.  Hold the spring and spin the tires by hand. You will feel a bad bearing growl.

Cartalk,3e3mwe,bamfindian,4,Tue Jul 21 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"No, you can't do it yourself.  Servicing AC requires tools and equipment that greatly exceed the cost of that repair.  No, you can't patch a cracked casting."

Cartalk,3e20ru,cybertron3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:55 2015 UTC,Up and down? Left and right?  Just vibration? Is there noise? How loud is it?  Does it match your speed (does the frequency increase with your speed)? Or is it fairly consistent after it starts?
Cartalk,3e20ru,cybertron3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:46 2015 UTC,"It seems to be lateral, as there is no bump-motion inside the cabin, but there is a lot of vibration that is relayed through the seat and steering wheel.  There is no noise (well, any abnormal noise). It starts at around 140-150KM/h, prior to that there is no vibration (almost at all) and it has a linear progression, gets worse as the speed increases.  Could it be axle or bearing related? I have (almost) ruled out the wheels as the culprit."
Cartalk,3e20ru,ComradePotato,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"If it only starts around 140-150, you may be looking at a transmission problem. Is it a particular gear? If you force a downshift (I assume it is a sport shift), does the vibration go away?  If so, transmission. If not, axle/diff/bearings assuming the wheels have been ruled out."
Cartalk,3e20ru,canihavemyusername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"It has 5 gears and it doesn't show which one it is currently on the dashboard (or anywhere). Haven't tried a downshift, but I have paddle shifters behind the steering wheel so I will try it when I drive it again.  The vibration doesn't go away, only increases until I hit 300KM/h (removed the limiter :^ )  Transmission was replaced last year with a brand new one, so I doubt it is, but if needed I still have warranty left.  I too am leaning to axle/diff/bearings. Will have them inspected soon.  Thank you for your input :D"

When the car is idling too high you would look and see if the computer is trying to command the IAC valve to close. If it is, then you would know the computer is doing it's job, so the problem is with the IAC or there is a vacuum leak.   Those IAC valves mess up a lot, the motor inside it gets issues. But our shop has also replaced PCM's ( the computer) for idle control issues on those jeeps. And also we have seen the problem be the wires from the IAC got melted, or chewed by mice.  If it's a vacuum leak, it seems to be intermittent so when the car is idling too high try wiggling and moving the air tube and vacuum lines in case there is a sneaky crack somewhere."

I can't comment on the accuracy of that post as I've never done the job, but it doesn't seem too difficult.    I highly recommend purchasing a subscription of your car on alldata.com.  It will give you access to the Honda factory manual so you know you're getting good info.  Also includes torque specs and part numbers.  As for hard to reach bolts, a set of these will also come in handy from time to time.  You can use them in conjunction (or alone) if necessary with the swivel joint and regular extensions.  They ""wobble"" in their connection to the socket meaning you don't have to have the extension pointed straight ahead, gives you a little more angle to work with.  http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-1660-Combination-Extension-9-Piece/dp/B000NPUJLW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437420483&sr=8-1&keywords=wobble+socket"

Cartalk,3dycmb,JasonMaloney101,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"They've replaced so many of them at this point that you're not likely to even get them to acknowledge a problem unless this happens to you:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_Zf1eo0Pw  How many miles do you actually have on your vehicle? Has the CVT fluid ever been replaced?  There is a lot of conflicting info out there about Nissan CVT fluid change intervals; but based on all of the info I've been able to gather across various sources, most drivers should have their fluid changed every 30k miles.  If you're hearing that noise all the time and you've never changed yours, the damage may already be done, but Nissan officially considers (by scheduled maintenance policy, not necessarily by what their engineers say) the CVT fluid to be a factory fill item and thus can't deny a warranty claim because of it. If you are only hearing the noise intermittently, you might be able to get away with just changing the fluid. Oh, and don't listen to the advice people will give you about the dangers of changing automatic transmission fluid -- this is NOT a traditional automatic transmission, and it is VERY IMPORTANT that you keep up with the fluid.  I unfortunately can't link the bulletins here (you can purchase them at nissan-techinfo.com), but you can find information about them around the web.  The first bulletin describes the fail-safe mode (over-filled fluid, incorrect fluid, or incorrect coolant/water mix may cause the transmission to enter fail-safe mode to protect itself) and most up-to-date procedure for checking the fluid level (they now accept a much narrower range for fluid level, to the point where some factory fills are now considered over-filled).  The second bulletin describes the fail-safe mode being triggered under extreme driving conditions (which basically amount to driving on the Interstate on a hot summer day anywhere in the US, especially a section that has lots of elevation changes). This is what you see happen to the Rogue in the above video. If this happens to you, a counter will increment in your transmission computer (this is NOT a normal fault code -- they will ONLY see it if they're looking specifically for it).  Per the service bulletin, any vehicle with that counter incremented should have a special external transmission cooler installed. Until very recently (looks like the bulletin was last updated July 9, 2015 and is now NTB13-095b), that cooler was part of a limited-supply restricted service kit that even the dealership could not order without getting prior authorization from a special dispatcher (the dealer would actually have to send them a screenshot of the diagnostic showing your VIN and the counters).    Basically, almost every automatic transmission has an external cooler (for heavy-duty applications, this will often be a standalone transmission cooler; for lighter applications, the standard radiator is internally partitioned to accommodate both engine coolant and transmission fluid). The Xtronic CVT in your vehicle, however, instead has something a little different:  http://imgur.com/hYEJuUj  This block (sometimes called a beehive or a water-to-oil cooler) is mounted on your CVT. The two lines are connected to your water pump and radiator, allowing heat exchange between your engine coolant and your CVT fluid. This allows your engine to heat up the fluid when it's cold and your radiator to keep it from getting too warm.  Now, take another look at the heat exchange block. You see the two recessed circles? In some applications, there are two additional lines which connect to an external radiator/cooler and actually allow CVT fluid to flow into and out of the block. With the limited power of the 2.0L B16 Sentra (and its lack of attractiveness as a highway vehicle), Nissan didn't think you would need that. But if you frequently take long trips in the hot summer weather, you really do need it.  You can see more info on the CVT cooler here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyp9gMRnW1k  Ready to get mad? The highest trim B16 Sentra (2.5L) actually did come with the four-port heat exchange block and the external cooler! In fact, your vehicle is actually prefabricated with the necessary mounting holes for it! The service kit referenced by the above bulletin basically adds to your vehicle what it should have had from the factory. And what's worse, since Nissan considers the problem to only arise under ""extreme"" driving conditions, they often won't cover this service kit under warranty!  Some people have had luck getting Nissan Consumer Affairs to cover the cost as a goodwill measure. Regardless of whether you actually end up needing the service kit or not, I would call them before you do anything else to start documenting your case."
Cartalk,3dycmb,_atwork,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly informative. Do you know if Nissan continues this practice in other makes/models, or have they started to include a more reasonable CVT fluid cooling system in all vehicles with the Xtronic CVT?"
Cartalk,3dycmb,JasonMaloney101,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:13 2015 UTC,I haven't really kept up. There was a major revision to the CVT (which is actually manufactured by Jatco and used in other makes too) a few years ago which further reduced friction and uses yet another new fluid. If I recall correctly it made its debut in the 2013 Altima.
Cartalk,3dycmb,JasonMaloney101,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"The car now has slightly less than 117,000 miles on it. I have never changed the fluid myself, as I bought it used last year for school. It hasn't started making that noise until a few months after I got it. The noise comes when I drive at highway speeds and seems to get worse when driving for a long time. I don't hear it when I drive in town. In the video I posted I have been driving for about 5 hours, (getting back to school after visiting family in another state) but the noise starts as soon as I get above ~50mph. It was also 95+ degrees Fahrenheit that day.   Do you suggest I should call Nissan Consumer Affairs after I have the dealer look at it again? I know you said to call before I do anything else, but I have nothing that states it's a problem with my CVT. The first time I went the noise was not as loud but I can show the mechanic the video. The invoice from the dealer shows nothing was found.  Do you think this is enough for them to replace the transmission under warranty? Would they replace the CVT fluid under warranty? I know the heat exchange block might be tougher to get.  Again, I can't thank you enough for this information."
Cartalk,3dycmb,rva2nova,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I suggest doing as much research as you can to familiarize yourself with the issue and then calling to file a case. You can start with your dissatisfaction that you paid the dealership for a diagnostic and didn't receive an answer to your concern. You're definitely going to need the fluid changed either way (and no, that isn't a warranty item; they just can't deny your warranty for not doing it). That probably should have been the dealer's first suggestion.  I'll add that the new CVT fluid should reduce or eliminate the noise. Keep your cooling system in check, and you can probably make it without the external cooler. I actually switched my 2008 Sentra to the new Nissan blue long life coolant (LLC). It's the factory fill for 2010+ but it's compatible with all B16's and lasts significantly longer than the green LLC."
Cartalk,3dycmb,Heratiki,4,Tue Jul 21 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I had this happen with my 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer CVT.

Shortly after I lost acceleration power. They said it was throwing some code related to the immobilizer so they tried programming a new key - that didn't work. I had to leave the car with them for about a week and eventually after they continuously test drove it, the engine just stopped and they had to replace the transmission."
Cartalk,3dycmb,rva2nova,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:52 2015 UTC,So it was the transmission? Or did they just not tell you what caused the issue?
Cartalk,3dycmb,Heratiki,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:49 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if it actually threw an a code related to the transmission. They basically just said your car died and we're replacing the transmission.

Cartalk,3dy4fs,c-dime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"first option:  if you have the fold down seats (60/40 split), try wedging an object between the 2 seats.  then, shine a flashlight into the trunk lid, you will see that the latch has a glow in the dark release lever (meant for you in case you wake up locked in the trunk).  stick something in, like a golf club or hockey stick, and try to pop that latch.  Ive successfuly done this quite a few times.  second option: remove the seat.  you need to pull the bottom section off (there should be 2 big clips towards the front of the cushion). you may need to pull hard, or press some sort of tab to release the clips.  you can probably start pulling up enough to see exactly what kind of clip is holding it down. once that is off, you will then get access to a few screws to take the back cushion off. usually its 2 or 3 screws on the bottom, 10 or 12mm.  After this, pull straight up and the whole thing will come out in one piece.    If you need pictures, look up the installation process for rear speakers on sentra forums.

Also, I jumped it to get it starting again and Firestone tested it, but would not fix it.   Alright, thanks. Why are you instructing me to stop going to Firestone? I have a very limited knowledge bank regarding cars and their workings, and at Firestone they have been nothing but honest and genuine when servicing my vehicles. Especially, price wise.

If you'd give me a chance to explain. I do not recommend anyone going to any chain repair shops for anything other than basic things like tires or brakes. I strongly recommend not using them for oil changes as well, due to the likelihood of them screwing it up and ruining the motor.   Chain repair shops are like the McDonald's of the car world. They may or may not be honest, but that's a whole other story. The point is that they're mostly untrained teenagers who don't know anything besides basic maintenance. If and when they screw up, it will end up costing you thousands. Find a local reputable independent shop, preferably one that specializes in Hondas or hybrids. Their prices will be mostly comparable, but they have 10x the skill and knowledge of these kids.  Point in case, your battery issue. It's fine that they refused to work on it, but the fact that they don't realize that 12V is 12V is telling.  I took my friends diesel ram into Firestone to test the batteries and then watch them test each on individually without isolating them, causing it to pass both batteries.

P0420 is a catalyst efficiency fault. In other words, the oxygen sensors are sensing that the cat is no longer functioning.   My last guess is possible back up in the catalytic converter and it being clogged somehow. If exhaust gases can't escape quickly maybe that causes the cylinders to misfire.   Seems like the most reasonable guess to me. Pull off the cat and drive it and see if the problem goes away."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is ""catalytic efficiency below threshold bank 1"".  I should have specified but just wrote cause I assume it just means a faulty reading with the O2 sensor.  What if the O2 sensor went bad? Does that all of a sudden like this? Also, I was under the assumption that there is a sensor before and after the catalytic converter and that one of them send info back to help control A/F mixture.  So if true and if that's the one that failed, there is another potential source."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,3,Mon Jul 20 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"It's possible it's a bad O2 sensor, but not likely, because when it's bad it will typically show unrealistic values and the ECM will register that as a separate fault.  Yes there are 2 of them. The pre cat is dual purpose. It is used to measure the air/fuel mixture of the car, and also to use as a reference to measure efficiency. It is used as a baseline hydrocarbon measurement going into the cat, and compared against the hydrocarbon measurement coming out of it (post cat) to determine efficiency.  But, again, if the pre cat sensor went bad it would more than likely not trigger this fault."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,TrouserPudding,0,Mon Jul 20 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"In other words, the oxygen sensors are sensing that the cat is no longer functioning.   Incorrect.  It means that the delta between the upstream and downstream O2s isn't great enough.  As I posted long ago this can be and usually is caused by unmetered air (vacuum leak) or exhaust leaks in front of the upstream sensor.  A DTC is not a diagnosis, and P0420 is about the most common and misdiagnosed one.  If I had even 10% of the money spent on cats and O2 sensors that were sold because some part store monkey convinced some poor sap that the code reader can magically diagnose a car.........   Pull off the cat and drive it and see if the problem goes away.   Uhhhh...that's not how you check for a plugged cat.  You use a pressure sensor in the upstream O2 bung."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"It means that the delta between the upstream and downstream O2s isn't great enough.  As I posted long ago this can be and usually is caused by unmetered air (vacuum leak) or exhaust leaks in front of the upstream sensor.   Unmetered air leak would register at the pre-cat and throw lean mixture faults, and would not affect post cat.   A DTC is not a diagnosis, blah blah blah   I'm fully aware. I'm not some shadetree mechanic, I'm a trained and experienced professional and don't need these rudimentary concepts explained to me.   Uhhhh...that's not how you check for a plugged cat.  You use a pressure sensor in the upstream O2 bung.   OP is not a mechanic. He likely doesn't have that sort of tool. If he removes the cat with basic hand tools and it stops misfiring, you have successfully diagnosed the issue."

Cartalk,3dvxpb,TrouserPudding,2,Mon Jul 20 07:16:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like a vacuum or exhaust leak.
Cartalk,3dvxpb,TrouserPudding,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:41 2015 UTC,An exhaust leak cause could cause it to misfire?
Cartalk,3dvxpb,TrouserPudding,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on how bad/where, but it's a lot more likely to be a vacuum leak.  Or it could be both.  Exhaust leaks often cause P0420 DTCs."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,CarCrazyChris,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  If it idles fine and doesn't jump all over the place, could it still be a vacuum leak?"
Cartalk,3dvxpb,epiiplus1is0,3,Mon Jul 20 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just depends on where the leak is and how big/consistent.  It's easy to check for.  Do you know about the carb cleaner test?  Just get it idling and spray it around carefully in different spots that could have a potential to leak (hoses, hose connections, intake manifold gaskets) and if the engine surges or bogs you've found it.  This also work with a propane torch (unlit of course) which can help you narrow down exactly where the leak is once you've found the general area."

Cartalk,3dvxpb,TrouserPudding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"Check the cap and rotor on the distributor>220k miles. Manual. Always ran great and no history.  Been adding a quart of oil every 700-1000 miles for the past 3 years (leaks).  Driving at highway speed yesterday CEL comes on and is flashing.  I get off and pull over.  Before stopping, light stops flashing and is now just on.  Turn car off and then back on again.  CEL is off.  Drive 10 minutes to destination.  Leave destination, CEL comes back on.  Noticed a slight loss of power up a hill. Not terrible but I had to down shift.  Immediately got engine codes read at AA.  Drove home with no problem just CEL light on.  They are:  P0420 emissions O2   P0300 Random cylinder misfire  P0303 Misfire cylinder 3  P0304 Misfire cylinder 4  P1399 Random cylinder misfire  So 4 codes relating to cylinder misfire and one for exhaust gasses not being what they should.  Here is what I have reasoned so far: Not spark plug or wire related (they all aren't gonna go at once to have issues in multiple cylinders). Could be a fuel issue. I just filled up my tank.  Was pretty empty before this.  Maybe dirt or something was in there.  No idea what to do other than dump some cleaner stuff in (cheap). Distributor could be bad ($70 fix). Other than that I am not sure.  My last guess is possible back up in the catalytic converter and it being clogged somehow. If exhaust gases can't escape quickly maybe that causes the cylinders to misfire.    Because of the sudden nature of this happening, I don't know what I can rule out and what I can't.  Any suggestions on where to start first?"
Cartalk,3dvxpb,IVIaster5hake,0,Mon Jul 20 02:48:40 2015 UTC,420 you can ignore. A misfire can cause a 420. You might want to try the distributor. Vacuum leaks won't cause a misfire. It's almost always spark related
Cartalk,3dvxpb,IVIaster5hake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think he is right about the spark.  Start with looking at the cap and rotor, plugs/wires, and coil."
Cartalk,3dvxpb,IVIaster5hake,2,Mon Jul 20 11:36:15 2015 UTC,"Vacuum leaks won't cause a misfire   This is just blatantly incorrect and terrible advice.

Cartalk,3dvxpb,FARTBOX_DESTROYER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:31:00 2015 UTC,9 times out of 10 it's the one before the cat. An in depth diagnostic scan can normally tell you which one.
Cartalk,3dvxpb,RoofAddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"Okay.  If there is a fault in the one before the cat, if there is not one after the cat, does that mean that the cat is doing its job? Otherwise I would expect to see faults at both"
Cartalk,3dvyup,chinggu,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"You mentioned fuel injectors, but are you sure your 1991 car is fuel injected and not carbureted? I don't know volvos, but if you did not in fact overheat, then you're describing vapor lock.   A lot depends on if your temp gauge is working and your coolant level (low coolant/coolant leak can cause an unreliable temperature gauge)."
Cartalk,3dvyup,Tripplite,3,Mon Jul 20 03:03:38 2015 UTC,240s were fuel injected.
Cartalk,3dvyup,cyrax6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:42 2015 UTC,"If so, that would rule out traditional vapor lock, but his description is spot on.  Hot day, car loses power and stalls, no other solid symptoms of overheat (steam, knocking, smell of hot coolant), letting the car sit for a while and it restarts and drives normally.   For a car with a carburetor, that signals a fuel line that got hot and vapor locked from internal evaporation. With fuel injection, it could still be a fuel delivery problem, but it shouldn't wait until the car or weather is hot to occur.   I once heard that volvos have two fuel pumps, and will still run if one goes bad or weak, but the performance is degraded. No personal experience on this brand though."
Cartalk,3dvyup,Tripplite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:51:52 2015 UTC,This sounds similar to a problem i had with my 199x mercury mystique and the problem for me was bad fuel lines  edit:  on topic i agree that finding out if your temp gauge is reading properly would be the first step
Cartalk,3dvyup,CoryTrevor4Ever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:40 2015 UTC,"thanks for this. I will take it to a shop tomorrow and ask them to replace the engine and AC coolant, and to see if they are able to check the temp gauge.  This would make the most sense that a low coolant level would affect the temp gauge, because the temp gauge is definitely not accurate at the moment. Will post update tomorrow."
Cartalk,3dvyup,Tripplite,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"Be careful.   The engine uses coolant (water with antifreeze in it) which isn't part of the AC system at all. The AC uses refrigerant, and that only keeps the passenger compartment cool. I wouldn't request any work in the AC system until you have all other issues sorted out, and then only if it's not working.   You can check your engine coolant level yourself, first check the overflow tank (it has a mark) and then, only if the engine is cooled down from sitting, take off the radiator cap and check the radiator. It should be full.   Engine coolant should be replaced at the proper maintenance intervals listed in your owners manual. Traditional coolant usually needed to be replaced every 24 months to prevent corrosion in the cooling system.   Whether you make these checks or pay someone to do it, it's very important to use the correct coolant for your car. I have no idea what Volvo uses, but it's important to use the right type and to be consistent (don't mix types). Quickie oil change places are not competent to obtain and use the right coolant for unusual, old, or rare cars.   If you want to drive a 25 year old car, it would be a great idea to get a book on basic automative concepts, like the Boy Scout auto mechanic merit badge pamphlet, and a shop manual for your car, like the one from Haynes."
Cartalk,3dvyup,CoryTrevor4Ever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"so to understand a bit more when you turn the car on and gassed it, the engine didnt rev at all, and the car stalled again?  can the car idle and not stall out?"
Cartalk,3dvyup,teiscoGuitar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, that is exactly what happened. It was running fine, until I braked, coming to a complete stop (not in park) during traffic. Once traffic started moving again, I gassed it, but did not rev at all. Didn't feel any resistance from the gas pedal. At this point, the car was slightly rolling because it was in DRIVE, but then started to stall and just shut off.   I just took it for a drive ~15 miles, and it seems fine. Can idle without stalling now. (That was the first and only time it died out on me) But when I stop at a red light, I DO feel a slight stutter coming from the bottom/front of the car, similar to how it felt when it started to stall. Once I get rolling however, it goes away."
Cartalk,3dvxww,DangerSummoner,5,Sun Jul 19 23:54:46 2015 UTC,It is not a dealer only part. Go to dormanproducts.com and enter your vin number.  They call it an egr line. There are three options and they list them all.  Then just take the part number and get it off of amazon or rockauto. You can also give the number to a local parts store and they may have it or can at least order it in.
Cartalk,3dvxww,redmr2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:11 2015 UTC,The name doesn't matter: it's a dealer part.  (It's the EGR tube).  Just go to the parts counter and have your VIN with you.  They will match up the correct part.  If it snapped due to rust you are likely going to have a hell of a time getting the old one off/new one on the manifold.

Cartalk,3dvpqn,TrouserPudding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:14:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll tell them to check that next time.
Cartalk,3dvpqn,Downtownpiglet,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the codes have what's called two trip detection and the computer has to run the monitors and have them fail twice before it will put the check engine light on.   You can check if the MAF sensor fixed the problem by looking at the scan data on the trucks computer. The P0171 and P0174 codes indicate the fuel trim is too lean. The computer tries to add more fuel to compensate but it can't bring the trim to stociometric even with its injectors putting in all the fuel they can. You can see this on the scan tool. It will have short and long term fuel trim values and you can watch them. For instance if your fuel trims are too lean at idle but when you rev the car up they come down, then you would realize that you still probably have a vacuum leak to fix before your trip.  I like to test my fuel mileage scientifically. I fill my car up at the same gas station, same pump if possible. Set my trip meter to zero and then next time I get gas I write down how much gallons it takes to fill the tank and how many miles on the trip meter. Then I divide the miles by the gallons and reset the trip meter. After I went through 3 or 4 tanks of gas I can calculate my average gas mileage. My Civic gets 38!!!"
Cartalk,3dvpqn,hoostie95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"I might have to try this next time I go in, thank you. And I agree with the scientific testing. It's actually what I'd do right now but I'm unfortunately on a short time table. I have to drive long distance on Tuesday which doesn't give me a whole lot of time to run down a whole tank of gas and refill. I'd try doing it partially but my gauge isn't exactly always consistent in that respect. Great advice though!"
Cartalk,3dvpqn,hoostie95,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was your maf sensor, but if it was mulage could of wrnt down. When your maf fails the car goes into speed density mode and just uses the 02 sensors. Usually the air flowing jnto the motor goes thriugh the maf, so the computer will kbow how much fuel to dump in. That should of thrown its own code. I would guess if its throwing 2 lean codes that you have a vacuum leak. It shouldn't take very long for the code to come back. It will take a while for your car to start getting better gas mileage. Since its been running lean, or at least the computer thinks it has your car needs to relearn its fuel trims. Basically the computer adapts and stores how it adds fuel in a big spreadsheet. Since its thought its lean that whole spreadsheet is filled with numbers that will make it add more fuel. Which will make gas mileage go down. It should over a day or so of driving relearn the new trims and your gas mileage should get better. Assuming your original problem is fixed.  A problem like an 02 sensor is a hard code. It will not go away until you reset the code with a scanner. As a general rule never trust anyone at parts stores. Most of the time they don't know there ass from a hole in the ground. Generally the guy that deals with all the shops knows more than the guys at the front counter. But I've never really met anyone at the front counter that has known enough to help. Good thing I don't need the help lol."
Cartalk,3dvpqn,hoostie95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think it would be possible for my engine to adapt to better mileage before Tuesday afternoon? I'll be taking a long trip and I'd like for it to adapt by then. What would be a good way to speed up the process?    Also, can you ELI5 what a vacuum leak is? I posted this question on another board and a user said that there's a 90% chance that nothing was wrong with my MAF and that the codes were thrown because of the original problem, my broken upstream hose. Here's a picture of it, for reference:  http://i.imgur.com/micih7r.jpg   The red circles indicate where the hose broke, and where it connects on the other end. As you can see, it split in half, and the original code for this problem triggered months ago. The other user said that the car was most likely sucking in too much air because of it, and as a result, after it happening for so long, it ended up throwing the other two codes."
