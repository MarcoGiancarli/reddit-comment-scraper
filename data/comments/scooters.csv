In this situation I go full throttle down hill. It is not very violent at all, but gives spurts of slowing down. It feels similar to shifting to a lower gear in a car going down hill, but does not occur when the choke is on. I do not ride with the choke at other times. I also have the idle screw in all the way, which is pretty much needed for a good idle. I have tried choking it while idling with the kick stand. When I do this it is quite apparent that the idle screw is turned in too much for this ""setting."" If I leave it on long enough the wheel will spin a a speed that is more rapid than desirable for a kickstand idle.  Thanks"

I stripped my variator pulley recently when the nut came loose and did some damage to an expensive racing crankshaft but still seems O.K., was worried about looseness, welding on the pulley would it not make servicing impossible? Also cannot remove from crankcase without cutting off the welded part and destroying crankshaft.

scooters,3dvgjt,Jonpaddy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ninjas are great bikes to buy used because people get them, don't ride them, and sell a few years later for a good price and low miles. Reselling it will be tougher to get your investment back, but you have a good brand and taken care of, it'll give another rider loads of fun when you do sell."

I also painted my variator cover, it came painted stock silver, use primer and sand carefully before skilfully applying good automotive paint for good results, powder coat would be more durable."
scooters,3dv3yd,railker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:52 2015 UTC,With a performance exhaust it will need a bigger jet as the airflow is increased and it will run lean.  For the acceleration issue have you tried lighter weight rollers?  Some of your answers may be found here>> http://www.provoscooter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=19773

scooters,3du2k4,mrbbrj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:35 2015 UTC,Ended up taking the battery to autozone and they're saying it's just dead. Apparently the 12 v batteries have to be put on slow trickle charge instead of fast charge if they're dead. We'll find out tomorrow if it works!
scooters,3du2k4,iven-isbleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:55:25 2015 UTC,Is there nothing happening  at all? Does it tick over?
scooters,3du2k4,iven-isbleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, it has zero juice. Even just trying to turn on the lights or something does nothing. I went and had the battery tested this morning at autozone and they only determined that it had zero charge. Apparently I was charging under the wrong mode so I'm trying the trickle setting today. Will know more tomorrow."
scooters,3drlpn,Beardjj,4,Sat Jul 18 19:57:21 2015 UTC,Print a service manual at work or school or some place free. Comes in super handy when you just want to know what sort of oil to get or how much to put in or how tight a bolt should be or anything. I printed mine at work and it's faster than searching the web for most maintenance queries. Oh and find a disk break lock so it's harder to roll that thing away while you are in the dispensary or wherever you kids shop
