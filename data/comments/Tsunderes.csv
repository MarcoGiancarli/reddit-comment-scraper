Tsunderes,3e5hs5,yzmetric,3,Wed Jul 22 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"I've never really taken personality tests very seriously. Just going by the basic descriptions I would say a tsundere would probably either be an ESTJ or ESFJ.  For the fun of it I ended up trying to take one of those tests while trying to maintain the tsundere mindset, ended up getting ENTJ. It's pretty hard to keep consistent with answers when one of the inherit traits of tsundere characters involve jumping back and forth between emotions."
