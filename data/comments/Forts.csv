The pillar in the middle to stabilize the roof is also well choosen, for its not big to take up to much space bit it looks strong enough to withstand some volleys of Girl archery (whatever they are shooting, never went to war with them...). You also got a very good situation reporter which indicates the status of the fort (the LED-STRIP). the communication central and public broadcast system seems to be in a good shape. All in all I have to say that your Fort-Bhox is a superb piece of architecture. I give it a 9/10, because the window and the rood are some weakpoints which could have been secured better.

Forts,2wpbhj,UnicornOfDesire,1 point,Sun Feb 22 08:19:23 2015 UTC,"Aw, cool. Thanks."
Forts,2wb25o,wubbaaalubbadubdub,7,Wed Feb 18 12:54:14 2015 UTC,Of course! Why would you ever want to take it down? I've already decided when my GF and I move in together the living room will be a permanent blanket fort. I'm still working on the planning.
Forts,2wb25o,CameronMurray,7,Wed Feb 18 15:09:01 2015 UTC,One does not simply take down a fort.
Forts,2wb25o,patotoy,4,Wed Feb 18 17:51:42 2015 UTC,That is so cool! Kudos.
Forts,2w79al,freddiemichael,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:48:21 2015 UTC,How'd you get the blanket to hang from the ceiling like that? nice :D

Forts,2vyafa,coppersparrow,2,Sun Feb 15 13:54:49 2015 UTC,What all is on the menu?

Forts,2vyafa,ah_alyssa,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:11:46 2015 UTC,OH MAN thanks for posting these!!! i totally wanna do something like this for my boyfriend.
Forts,2vyafa,ah_alyssa,1 point,Thu Apr 9 08:40:17 2015 UTC,"no prob! I'm not sure what your place is like, but my apartment has very few places to hang things from or tie sheets to. I found that sticking plastic picture hanging hooks (the adhesive kind that remove easily) to my ceiling was the best way to build it! I stuck them on my ceiling and walls, looped pieces of string through my sheets, and hung them from the hooks. Worked really well!"
Forts,2vtur9,petandpal,3,Sat Feb 14 01:16:06 2015 UTC,Smells like sex in here
Forts,2vjci5,TrendingBot,3,Wed Feb 11 14:19:50 2015 UTC,And yet in 9 hours there are only 35 upvotes and I'm the only comment. Post more forts and make this sub more exciting!
Forts,2vjci5,EricArmstrongg,2,Wed Feb 11 23:59:48 2015 UTC,was the only comment...granted this has nothing to do with forts.
Forts,2vjci5,Trebay,2,Thu Feb 12 01:47:01 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Now we just need a way to have more active members.

Forts,2vjm84,eagles85,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:57:00 2015 UTC,Our ice fort locally was only open for 3 days this year due to our unseasonably warm weather.
Forts,2vjm84,titanicx,2,Thu Feb 12 15:04:38 2015 UTC,I'm realizing Saranac Lake is often nationally recognized as the coldest place in the country...I suppose its not as big of an issue for them. http://coldestplaceinthenation.com
Forts,2v0l03,brygphilomena,3,Fri Feb 6 19:38:07 2015 UTC,What are we listening to?
