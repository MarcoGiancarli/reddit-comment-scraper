Drama,3e31iu,Discord_Dancing,8,Tue Jul 21 16:51:23 2015 UTC,Hacker News is a lot like Reddit was when Reddit was just tech people nerding out about tech topics. A lot of Hacker News is people from old school Reddit who moved once Reddit became non-tech oriented.

Art can be considered offensive in context and is often censored as views change.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that glorification of the Confederacy is a big fat problem.

It's not like I posted there or anything though.  My entire interactions with them were clicking a link to go to the page once, looking at the frontpage, and then closing the tab.

My understanding is that it was pretty much set up to upset SRS. A while back they were in the midst of a big campaign against /r/seduction because a user there published an ebook that in one section was telling guys to be forceful with women, like grabbing and kissing them forcefully. They inflated that into it being a ""rape manual"", and worked very hard to spread the stigma to all of /r/seduction and to Reddit more generally. So someone set up a subreddit that was supposed to be a literal rape manual to piss them off."

Just because you dislike a particular user, or disagree with something they said or did doesn't mean it's okay to target all of their posts and comments.

Drama,3dy09d,WhiteMarauder,5,Mon Jul 20 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"if you're contributing to Reddit.   That's almost entirely subjective. The definition of spam is ""unsolicited or unwanted content"". If he's just reposting, and a lot of people don't want or like reposts, then by definition it's unwanted, and thus spam.  I think it is the volume that matters here. He's literally throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the wall and hoping something sticks. That's how he gets his karma. By definition, to me, that's spamming. That's different than someone finding something interesting and going ""Huh, I bet reddit would like this."" Then sharing. The guy purposefully appears to be trying to get as much karma as he can by submitting as many links as possible. I think his ""contributions"" to reddit are minimal at best because that's not his intention. His intentions are to acquire as much karma as possible. I mean, that much is obvious."

Drama,3dy09d,4ringcircus,7,Tue Jul 21 05:18:06 2015 UTC,I spammed those screenshot to a bunch of people and the common thread seems to be that a lot of moderators think he's manipulating votes to get his karma. I usually am of the opinion that no one would actually go to that much effort but after seeing him accuse us of vote manipulation I have to wonder.
Drama,3dy09d,4ringcircus,3,Tue Jul 21 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"That suspicion is certainly warranted. But a bunch of people must have already reported him to the admins with the amount of hate he gets, and it seems they haven't found anything. That'd mean he's either using proxies to not get caught or he just posts a lot and the sheer volume of stuff he posts gets him to the front page. IIRC somebody in this thread said he had made like 20 posts in a few minutes. The probability of one of them getting to the front is quite high."
Drama,3dy09d,Iama_tomhanks,4,Tue Jul 21 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you're manipulating votes and you're good at it the admins aren't going to catch on very quickly. I think it takes more than a quick glance to catch that kind of thing. He would almost certainly have to be using proxies. Generally making a new account and logging into it and upvoting it yourself doesn't work. Your karma score appears to go up but a couple minutes later a downvote is added. It's always hard to tell because of the vote fuzzing but I think one of the best kept secrets of reddit is that vote manipulation is harder than it appears. If he really is cheating somehow I imagine a mod will figure it out at some point and he'll be banned."

She's a scumbag if she cheated, but no amount of freely donated money gives someone the right to tell another person who they can sleep with and when they can do it.  If the citizens of Rochester want to attach a chastity rider to their donations they can go nuts with that or maybe donate to an organization who is legally required to use their money in a certain way.  $20 thrown into a bucket at the grocery store doesn't buy you someone's autonomy."
Drama,3dz3g6,adlauren,9,Mon Jul 20 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"gives someone the right to tell another person who they can sleep with and when they can do it   Okay, being serious.  What bothers me, and I can only suspect other people, is not that people move on from a spouse's death: it's the sinking sense from this new information that her act/media campaign about how she was so broken up about it that she needed money to help her through the grieving process was probably just that, an act: that she was dishonestly and calculatedly exploiting the death of her husband to get as much cash as she could out of it.  It's not on the level of ""charity fraud"" but it is on the level of ""squick thing to do"" for most people - something most people would not be capable of. Are people going to be starting lawsuits and attaching riders to charity checks going forward? No, but they are going to think she's kind of inhumane, and even if it's possible that because they don't know her mindset they might be wrong, I think they have a reasonable basis for thinking that."

Personally I don't even know if she was truly out there begging for cash on local TV every day or if it was just the local equivalent of a reddit feel good donation hug.  But even if she WAS the one asking for help, would moving on emotionally negate any need she had at the time?   How does sleeping with someone else negate her ability to reach out to the community for support? Was she obligated to disclose the details of her sex life before accepting money from anyone?  It seems a lot easier to assume money freely donated was given willingly and happily rather than pondering on the potential implicit and/or unspoken strings attached to charity given in a time of need. If the majority of the people who gave her money thought it was disgusting to eat meat, would a hate blog be appropriate in response to a facebook photo of her eating a cheeseburger?

Drama,3drvfz,kaalaaaa,5,Sat Jul 18 21:29:34 2015 UTC,"quite a few people in Britain liked the Nazis   Apparently this was true not just of Britain and the Nazis (and the British fascists) but of the US and fascism/Mussolini aswell to some extent.  Partly it was a desire not to have another war, partly that the nazis/fascists were treating communists and workers unions in a way that a lot of upper crust people liked (and they were very futuristic  and cool etc) but they also courted the British establishment (or bits of it) and stuff. Churchill was in a relatively small minority in thinking they were the biggest threat.   Edward VIII and his wife were quite big  fans and after he abdicated and moved to Portugal there was some thing where either he was going to go willingly or be kidnapped and maybe made Nazi king of England when they  had won, Churchill had to force him to go and live in the Bahamas.   He also apparently had a micropenis and she did loads of kegels and had amazing pc control, her grip was legendary.

The account was true and well-reported. It concerns a senior business executive at one of the most powerful media companies on the planet.  In the early days of the internet, that would have been enough. “We put truths on the internet.” That has been the longstanding position of Gawker journalists, some of the most uncompromising and uncompromised on the internet. I cannot blame our editors and writers for pursuing that original mission.  But the media environment has changed, our readers have changed, and I have changed. Not only is criticism of yesterday’s piece from readers intense, but much of what they’ve said has resonated. Some of our own writers, proud to work at one of the only independent media companies, are equally appalled.  I believe this public mood reflects a growing recognition that we all have secrets, and they are not all equally worthy of exposure. I can’t defend yesterday’s story as I can our coverage of Bill O’Reilly, Hillary Clinton or Hulk Hogan.   So he's saying Gawker's a tabloid..."

Today’s unprecedented breach of the firewall, in which business executives deleted an editorial post over the objections of the entire executive editorial staff, demonstrated exactly why we seek greater protection. Our opinions on the post are not unanimous but we are united in objecting to editorial decisions being made by a majority of non-editorial managers. Disagreements about editorial judgment are matters to be resolved by editorial employees. We condemn the takedown in the strongest possible terms.   With a necessary addendum by one Timothy Burke:   A large percentage of the Gawker Media editorial staff disagreed with Gawker’s decision to publish the post to which this statement refers. Our opposition to the removal of the post lies solely in the process by which that decision was made, not in regard to the content of the post itself."

The only reason to publish this is to shame some guy for wanting to sleep with a male porn star and to get clicks for doing so. The guy they're exposing here is the VICTIM of extortion. These assholes at Gawker cozied  up to a felony extortionist in order to further victimize this poor sap.   I seriously hope the piece of shit who wrote that story gets all of his past and future actions picked apart until something embarrassing pops out.  Gawker shames people for even the slightest sexist or homophobic behavior, but then has the nerve to aid an extortionist in outing an innocent closeted gay man.  Edit:  Just found a really good NYT's  article calling out Gawker for their bizarre obsession with men's consensual sex lives. Apparently they've pulled similiar shit with Shepard Smith and Anderson Cooper. They once ran an article about Shepard Smith getting  annoyed by a waiter taking his drink as an excuse to call him gay later on in the article.   They've also posted pornographic  personal photos and videos of male celebrities without their consent, which is especially rich since Gawker later tried to get on a moral soap box over the Jennifer Lawrence nude picture leak.  The outings at least could have some justification if we were talking about  vocally anti gay politicans, but Anderson Cooper, Shepard Smith, and this dude getting extorted aren't anti gay politicans. None of them even have anti gay opinions. Shepard Smith works at Fox News, but he's a centrist straight news guy unlike a lot of the network.  Shepard Smith endorsed gay marriage on his own show even before Obama or Hillary Clinton.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/business/media/gawker-kicks-open-the-closet-but-its-disclosure-barely-reverberates.html?_r=0"

This is considered a normal thing.  Then there's me. An internet user. I get to say whatever I want, and you don't actually have any authority over me.

And his latest insane rant isn't doing as well vote wise but still has 41 gildings and it's his most insane one yet. I can't be fucked reading that entire wall of text but there were a couple of parts that stood out to me.

That is to say that every racist/sexist bigot ON REDDIT is a proponent of unmoderated thunderdome style free speech.   That's not how venn diagrams work you fucking idiot.

What does that say about the state of your website when the default communities are brimming with toxicity and hatred?  There is a common belief that Redditors make accounts in order to unsubscribe from the default subreddits. What does that say about the state of your website when the default communities are brimming with toxicity and hatred?   Lol jesus fucking christ where has anyone ever said that this is the reason they unsub from defaults.   If left unchecked, your website will become a radioactive wasteland to the very celebs and advertisers you are trying to attract. But it's not too late. Only you can stop it. This is your watershed moment.   Hahaha fuck me he is actually delusional. He's so desperate to be a victim that he's gone beyond looking for things to be offended by. He's convinced himself that everyone is out to get him.   From fatpeoplehate to coontown to the ever present talisman of ""chan culture"" reactionary bollocks. These groups have shown time and time again that they are willing to lash out, disrupt and poison any community they set their sights on   PFFFFFFFTHAHAHA  ""They've shown it time and time again but I will present absolutely zero evidence of this. What SRS hasn't been taking over other subs like a cancer for years now what are you talking about?""   The basement of hate subs is no longer a containment. It's a lounge with a beacon. There is no ""exchange of ideas/honest discussion"" going on. There is only a podium for whatever crank pundit can present the warm milk to the default redditor about the encroachment of the omniscient millennial ""social justice warriors/bleeding heart liberals"".    Jesus fucking christ. This is literally the opposite of what is happening. He could live in a world where all white people had been exterminated and he'd still be screaming about how whitey is out to get him.   Places like /r/videos[15] , /r/news[16] , /r/pics[17] , /r/funny[18] and even /r/dataisbeautiful[19] and /r/todayilearned[20] are completely unrecognizable hubs of antebellum style 17th century phrenological debates about the degeneracy of women, gays and minorities. The recent Ellen Pao lynch mob is a perfect example of that. She was called a cunt and then Chairman Pao and then things like ""ching chong"" got tossed around.   I DON'T NEED TO PRESENT EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THESE THINGS ITS SO OBVIOUS JUST LOOK THROUGH THE COMMENTS OF EVERY POST ON REDDIT AND YOU'LL FIND THE RACISM ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS READ BETWEEN THE LINES YES EVEN MY POSTS THE WHITE MAN HAS FILLED ME WITH INTERNALIZED RACISM  I fucking love that he includes /r/blackfathers in the list of chimpire subs. I see people do that a lot and I wonder if they've ever been there. For fucks sake the only thing in the subs sidebar is a link to this sub.   It used to be folk wisdom to cut the head off a snake and burn the wound to prevent it from growing back. The days of the wild west have come and gone. It was funny. The frenzy. The fiends. The fire and brimstone. You're the new sheriff. As the media would have it, the default reddit face is someone in a klan hood who hates women and supports pedophilia in some form or the other. It is an unfortunate stereotype that seems to be passed around as some sort of penance for ""free speech"".   This would be a lot funnier if it weren't what at least half of reddit believes."

Drama,3dhvek,headasplodes,43,Thu Jul 16 12:05:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, I went ahead and did some actual research on this one.  First, let's look at the Metro News article. Actually, let's not, because it's taken directly from the ""Torstar News Service"", i.e. the Toronto Star, a rather more reputable source than Metro (which is a tabloid handed out for free on the subway). So, let's look at the Toronto Star article, even though AFAICT it's word-for-word identical.  It seems like this is the most substantive allegation:   It was on Sept. 11 [Ed.: 2012] when Reilly began to be concerned for her safety, she testified. She and a group of friends met at a west-end bar and were tweeting about their evening, she testified.  “A whole lot of ugly at the Cadillac Lounge tonight,” @greg_a_elliott tweeted. The tweet made her fear that Elliott was at the same bar and search the room to make sure he was not, she said.   (FWIW, the Cadillac Lounge appears to be a pretty small place.)  Okay, that gives us something specific to search for. And thanks to Twitter's advanced search, I easily found the tweet in question (archive just in case). Notice it's dated the 10th by Twitter, not the 11th; that alone doesn't discredit the plaintiff, really, since that could be an innocent mistake or a quirk of time zones or something, idk.  So since Elliott wasn't present at the Cadillac Lounge, but knew about this... and since ""she and a group of friends... were tweeting about their evening"", it seems likely that he would have found this out by reading her at-the-time-public tweets. Unfortunately, I can't now verify that such information was made available, since her tweets are now protected. Oh, yeah, so are Guthrie's. Though FWIW, Guthrie has an easily found personal/professional web page where she calls herself a ""Gender Justice Consultant"", and invites people to follow her on Twitter (oops).  Meanwhile, note that Elliott's tweet was a subtweet, and in fact didn't @-mention anyone, and isn't part of any conversation timeline but stands alone. It doesn't even have the #topoli hashtag or anything. That in turn means that Reilly and/or her ""group of friends"" must have (as widely speculated/asserted in the /r/videos thread) looked it up in order to see it - after having blocked the guy. But he's the one obsessed with them, okay.  Speaking of obsession... a few of these articles have mentioned a hashtag ""#GAEhole"". Let's take a look at that, shall we?  Ooh, my. Well, it's not exactly a #yesallwomen-sized phenomenon. But I'm seeing a fair bit of drama, including a bunch of dudes standing up for m'lady. There's even one who seems to be making an accusation of pedophilia - which links a now-deleted tweet for evidence (this is referenced in Blatchford's latest piece, near the end). You can also see tweets showing vandalism of Elliott's street art. Looks like the hashtag got started up by a ""Sister Aloysius"", @bricolagestrid.  Wait, what's that you say? Someone who appears to be one of Reilly and Guthrie's female friends, whose tweets aren't protected, who might have been in that group at the Cadillac Lounge? Alas, I found nothing on this lead. Apparently there was also a ""parody #GAEhole account"". Further research suggests it was ""@GregurdyAErdiot"", but it got deleted in a few weeks (Elliott reported this (archive just in case) on the 13th).    Some other stuff worth noting:   This article is from almost exactly a year ago - Jul 24, 2014. The previous day, Christie Blatchford (the woman featured in the video) wrote this editorial for the National Post. Supposedly, the Metro News version of the Star article was ""updated"" today, but I can't see what was changed. Blatchford, meanwhile, wrote a new piece. I can't find any new content from the Star. The Toronto Star article doesn't mention any of the background context. You'd think that anyone who'd want to drive a narrative about the harassment of women would have included the juicy bit about the guy who made that ""beat up Anita Sarkeesian"" flash game. But then they'd be kinda forced to put it in the context of Reilly et. al. wanting to ""sic the Internet on"" that guy, so. The Star did, however, write about Guthrie in a separate article on Jul 23, 2014 (the day before, and same as Blatchford's piece). This article does mention the flash game, but doesn't name Sarkeesian:    Elliott and Guthrie also disagreed on her choice to out the identity of a Sault Ste. Marie gamer who created a online game in which the goal was to beat up the face of a prominent feminist, Guthrie testified.... During the extensive and often heated cross-examination, exacerbated Wednesday by a stifling hot courtroom, Murphy suggested that Guthrie and the two other complainants in the case were part of a larger conspiracy to “gang up on” Elliott. Guthrie has denied this.    Another interesting bit from the Star article of the 24th:    He also posted tweets like “Heather’s fat ass gets fatter” with the #TOpoli hashtag but without mentioning her Twitter handle in the tweet (known as sub-tweeting), the court heard.   What they don't mention is that this was also on the #GAEhole hashtag, apparently in response to Reilly using it to recommend blocking Elliott to someone else. You know, the hashtag they'd mentioned literally the previous day in an attempt at balanced coverage.   Oh, I found another Toronto Star article talking about the pedophilia accusation. Contrary to allegations in the /r/videos thread, this does not appear to have happened on the same night as the Cadillac Lounge incident. I can't find the alleged ""repl[y] to a tweet [Reilly] sent related to the Toronto International Film Festival"". I also can't identify the third complainant other than Reilly and Guthrie. She wasn't identified in a previous National Post article - that doesn't shy away from labelling Elliot a ""notorious Twitter troll"". (Though his last tweet apparently went out Nov 21, 2012, the still available feed (archive just in case - made today, but not by me!) is pretty well full of... well, more shitposting than trolling, really.) While researching this, I accidentally discovered that yesterday was the 3rd anniversary of the upload of PSY's Gangnam Style to Youtube.     For reference for out-of-towners: The National Post is considered ""conservative"" by Wikipedia, citing ""worldpress.org""; I'd agree, but it's nowhere near the furthest-right-wing paper readily available in Toronto. The description from the linked thread, ""right-wing websites with a presumably anti-feminist bias like the National Post or Alex Jones."", is... impressive.  The Star is described similarly as supporting ""social liberalism""; it's probably the furthest-left paper in the city that you can actually subscribe to (and isn't free at newsstands), but it's usually not that far out there (except maybe during election cycles)."

Drama,3dhvek,zahlman,17,Thu Jul 16 17:06:01 2015 UTC,"Well, using this article.   At one point Guthrie rolled her eyes after Elliott’s attorney, Chris Murphy, asked about the left-leaning politics of three city councillors Guthrie had as part of a panel in May 2012.   That's rude and disrespectful, especially in a courtroom. That's not behavior of a nice person.   Guthrie decided not to work with Elliott and told him so over email, which showed a seemingly cordial back-and-forth.  Guthrie told court the emails “sound like a man who’s masking some anger.”   Using the authors perspective, it seems Guthrie is reading emotion into something that the author doesn't feel was there.    “I want his hatred on the Internet to impact his real-life experience,” Guthrie wrote on Twitter in July 2012.   Here she wants to harass the game's creator so badly it impacts his real life.   I can't find the one that painted the picture that she rallied people against Elliott with a hashtag."

Yes it's a dictatorship and it's not the centre of world power, but neither is anywhere else Central America or the Caribbean, poverty rates are less than most other Caribbean and central American countries, Cuba does better on food security than most of it's neighbours aswell, and it is one of the highest ranked places in Latin America on the UN's human development index.

Nah, that doesn't make much sense if you actually think about it instead of blindly buy into it.  1 - Pretending to be an idiot.  2 - All FPH-themed subreddits created or taken over immediately after the FPH ban were banned for ban evasion. Admins are not impotent idiots bound by the dumb letter of the rules. Nobody was banned for criticizing Pao.  3 - Pretending to be an idiot to an extent that's actually insulting to anyone with above room temperature intelligence, as if there's a remote possibility that we are stupid enough to buy it.  4 - The only person who could explain that Pao was defending free speech from the board while Pao was still employed by the board was Pao herself. If Yishan tried to do that that would've been deeply offensive and damaging to her. Damaging because employers generally don't like when the employees shift the blame like that, offensive because it was her decision to make (which she didn't make for obvious reasons), not someone's who ""knows better"" and ""can explain it better"".  Anyway, as I said, we just have to wait. If the Purge happens, then Yishan probably wasn't straying to far from the truth: from the damage control perspective it wouldn't make a shred of sense to fire Pao before the purge, instead starting the reign of the permanent CEO with such a controversial decision. The only way that can make sense would be if she was in fact against it."

Oh no, I absolutely can fault idiots for starting a huge witchhunt without any information.   they just went on spree banning an idea, not a behavior   Yeah, I'm just imagining a fifth-grader who found a loophole in the rules: the admins can't prevent ban-evasion by a subreddit because they have to wait for them to break the rules again, ha ha, suck it admins!

Of course I can, there was a lot of place where people criticized her, including offsite, so if someone were, they would complain about that.

Visit Yishans quora page, he's talked at length about Poa and reddit in the past with no fucks given till now.   For example?  Again, imagine how this post would've looked to Pao if written while she was still the CEO. Now, this might surprise you, but neurotypical people routinely imagine how a situation would look from their friend's perspective and don't go there if it would look bad.

Have you tried having your resume critiqued over at /r/resumes? In my experience, a lot of people think that they are good at writing a resume when in fact they are almost 100% utter dog shit at it. A resume and a cover letter should be specially created for each and every job applied for. Most people don't do that. People also are seldom smart enough to catch onto the idea to repeat searchable keywords from job ads in both their tailored resume and letter.     Marketing and PR are youth games. If you're heading into your mid-30's, you should probably get an MBA of some description. It doesn't really matter from where."
Drama,3d7n7j,wolfdreams01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"I did when I got the degree, but not as much anymore. I actually never considered having anyone on reddit look at my resume, and I appreciate the suggestion. I'll look at the sub and figure out what measures they already have in place for privacy concerns and go from there. I've been wanting someone to look at my resume for awhile now truthfully, but I never considered reddit as a possible resource.   I know that I probably need an MBA, but I simply can't afford it at the moment. I cannot justify further student loan debt. In addition, most universities require two to three references to get into an MBA program. Right now, given my present work situation, I don't have anyone that would really make a good reference for me. I'm working, but not in a capacity where I'm using my degree or my talents. I'm basically a clerk, and I rarely even see or speak to my boss.  What I'd really like is to get into the market research or copywriting end of marketing. Which I am by no means too old for. :) But once again, no experience in the field means no one looks twice at me.   I do draft a cover letter specific to each application, but I haven't been tweaking my resume each time.   I have to admit, when I initially commented I was aggravated by what appeared to be a narrow view by someone who had never known what it was to struggle. Then I looked at your comment history and felt certain, based upon the subs you post in, that you wouldn't have anything relevant to add. In this, you've proven me wrong and I appreciate it."

When you spend any time around the field, you understand that the majority of people in it are scientists trying to figure shit out. And yes, it's in the past so it's impossible to know 100% for sure either way, but with access to more genetic information than ever before, there is definitely more scientific nature being brought into it."
Drama,3d62xk,Gilgamon,4,Mon Jul 13 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"Psychology is scientifically testable. You can propose a testable hypothesis and then repeat it and then draw conclusions. But how can you test something like ""women are needy because they need resources for offspring""? This is pop-psychology and stuff like this is why psychology doesn't even get regarded as a science by other fields.   I'm not saying that we shouldn't look into evo-psych or throw it out entirely. But saying stuff like ""scientists are just trying to figure shit out"" makes no sense as a defense for it. Hell, anyone can look to figure shit out, but it's the application of the scientific method that makes a person a scientist."

I read the ""naked ape"" a long time ago -- it's a book written in the 50'or 60's and it describes people from a zoologists perspective. It's important to connect ourselves with our poo-flinging cousins -- there are a lot of similarities there -- but this guy would talk about white, Middle-class European norms, comically parochial, and use our links to the apes to explain them.   People don't realize what a rorschach blot evo psych is. Even among the apes there are widely different behaviors among species; bonobos fuck, chimps fight. There are so many different strategies for solving problems, it's hard to pin down a behavior and say ""this is because of that.""   On the flip side of things, though, there are people who like to think ""men"" and ""women"" are arbitrary social constructs based on genitalia... that doesn't sound quite right to me, either. There are gender differences, as any casual stroll down death row can tell you; and there are attractive evolutionary theories for males are more violent; but are they anything more than ""just so"" stories?"

Psychology isn't a science it's a stop gap between understanding the brain and discovering mental health issues. We classify symptoms not actual problems. Where as evo psych should more akin to ""evolutionary behavioural study"". Of course we can't time travel and prove any theory completely correct, but we can still test for things and see how we work and propose theories from there.

I'll repeat: He didn't say that mods shouldn't be able to remove comments that make their panties chafe; Ghazi is losing its mind just because he said there should be some record of what has been removed.

For any Ghazelles who might be reading this, let me clue you in on something:  If harassment, death threats, hate speech, cyberbullying, etc. were such a huge problem -- if this were actually about that -- then the mods would be absolutely fucking ecstatic to have proof that this problem exists and that they do all this work to fight it.

At /r/PublicFreakout on of the only tools we have to counteract really offensive racist comments [most common on videos of black people, especially if someone crossposts it to /r/coontown] is deletion.  Banning doesn't always work since they can just make an alt and come back.  But if they know that any comments of that ilk will be deleted and unreadable they get sick pretty quick and stop.  If they know that their comments won't be permanently deleted - then there is no incentive to stop.  Now I'm not talking about a mildly offensive comment, with two people arguing and calling each other names - I'm talking about comments that wouldn't seem out of place in a Stormfront forum or /r/coontown.  Our members have said they don't to see that crap in the sub, and neither do we mods.  Now if the 'deleted but readable if you click on it' function was optional, I wouldn't have a problem.  Hell I would probably even use it occasionally myself on appropriate comments.  But we should have the option to 'delete and stay unreadable' for those comments/posts that need it.  Myself and the other mods have done a lot to turn the sub around in the past few months  - we even used to get (and still do) the occasiobal compliment in modmail on how the sub is a much better place.  Removing the ability to fully delete the racist comments would pave the way for the sub going back to what it was.  We don't want that racist crap, the vast majority of our members don't want it so we should be free to enforce those rules as/when we need to."

Reddit it a place where, no matter who you are, you will find stuff that will make your blood boil or your stomach turn. For me, it's part of the experience, makes it exciting in a way, and it fuels the drama that we all love gawking at over at subreddits like this one.  I personally think the the best way to put people off of poisonous groups like the folks of coontown, is to subject people to their ideas. For that reason alone I am not a fan of censorship. Give people a glimpse into the mind of the loathsome and they'll walk away in disgust, wiser than they were, more aware of that group's influence, and what they're trying to accomplish.  But you're right, even while communities mostly regulate themselves in terms of undesirable content (because it will be downvoted to shit anyway), for moderators, the new deletion rules are kind of a nightmare. It takes control away from them, while I think reddit should be doing the exact opposite - the more mod tools, the better. I am not a moderator myself, so I hadn't thought of it that way."
Drama,3d0y9c,ValiantPie,-6,Mon Jul 13 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Honest question: why?   I haven't really formulated my opinion fully, although I'm leaning in that direction; I don't think certain reprehensible groups are entitled to an audience. I see things like this(Which was at like +3000 when I first looked at it) where they try to chum up with people to gain support, and I personally think it should be stopped. They just see the admins and people defending them as useful idiots anyways Just my $0.02, and I'd be interested in changing my view.  Edit: What are the point of downvotes? To censor different ideas? They sure as hell aren't being used to downvote off-topic questions. You are hypocrites."
Drama,3d0y9c,ShrimpFood,9,Mon Jul 13 10:20:18 2015 UTC,Are you saying that you dislike that people called for the downvote of that post?
Drama,3d0y9c,OnSnowWhiteWings,-6,Mon Jul 13 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"No, I dislike that it was ever at 3000+ points. It's much lower now, but it was at one point top post, and sat at second highest score until someone pointed out his name.  My point being (as the reply mentioned, I'm really just repeating what he said because he put it eloquently) the Dylannstormroof account is just parroting what other people are saying to get support for his views. You know, chum up with everyone and when they're all comfortable, ""Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior the glorious superior White race?""  It's obvious what he's doing, and it's not really something I want to support. I don't think anyone is entitled to an audience, and I'm not going to defend that person's right to an audience; they'll only see me as a useful idiot anyways. I see myself, in a roundabout way, endorsing a view I do not agree with. That's why I feel an admin removing racist tripe isn't terrible. Many of the arguments have been debunked thoroughly on reddit, but unless they are debunked every time the same thing is posted, racists are going to bring in more people to their view. I guess my question is, why should I encourage that? Inaction is almost parallel to counter-action in this scenario.  Anyways, I don't see reddit as a free-speech platform. The majority can downvote something to invisibility anyways, so the only speech that's free on reddit is the popular opinion. Every sub does it: Try saying racism isn't bad on SRS, try saying x-kins aren't that weird on TiA. When the rules can be gamed or exploited in their current state (Like linking and brigading from off-site) don't you think the rules should be changed? We don't currently have free-speech rules, they just emulate free-speech in a haphazard way."
Drama,3d0y9c,theherps,5,Mon Jul 13 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"The point of Reddit has, and always will be for us as users to be able to downvote things we don't like and upvote things we do like.  Why should mods have to delete everything for us?  We have that power ourselves."
Drama,3d0y9c,ShrimpFood,4,Mon Jul 13 01:43:39 2015 UTC,It was never at +3000. Somewhere between 700-800 IIRC.

Drama,3d0y9c,kaalaaaa,-2,Mon Jul 13 02:16:59 2015 UTC,Well I think some people were pointing out it should be downvoted because the person was exploiting the fact that people don't read usernames. Building a fanbase is pretty easy on that foundation.
Drama,3d0y9c,kaalaaaa,18,Mon Jul 13 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in a country where racism, sexism, homophobia etc is all illegal, this is fucking weird and fucked up. Free speech ends where hate speech begins and it would be great if reddit banned these things as well.    So this person spends their free time looking up racism, sexism, homophobia, etc on the internet."
Drama,3d0y9c,kaalaaaa,10,Mon Jul 13 02:20:33 2015 UTC,Which could be better spent learning that hate speech is incompatible with free speech. Just because speech hurts your feelings doesn't mean it should be banned.

It's a 'he said she said' situation now and if the subreddit rules braking submissions and comment removals are made public the user base can form their own opinion if the mod or the one complaining is wrong.

It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible.     So no. The mods wouldn't lose the ability to remove comments from threads like you are implying. It would move those comments somewhere else where outsider can verify the legitimacy of those removals.    I like to imagine it as like a link on the sidebar next to mod list called ""mod actions"" where there is a list kinda like:    ""/u/mod1 removed comment ""die asshole"" from this thread. Reason: Rule 1""    ""/u/mod2 removed link ""[redacted]"" Reason: Dox (admins notified)""    Nothing would change in front page or in the comments.

Whether she was responsible for all the woes of Reddit is inconsequential . The perception that she is responsible is the only aspect of her tragicomic downfall that is of interest to the dramasphere.

This is not about your experiences and your view of this situation.

We have a tremendous amount of privilege, and we need to understand that that privilege is silencing the voices of those who actually need to be heard.  This is so fucking problematic.

A big problem is people wanting to drastically change their intake right away. Well no shit you're going to be hungry if you're used to eating twice as much. And you're almost for sure going to mess up. Why not do something like subtract an ounce or two of what you'd normally eat (depending on what it is) and get used to that. Then do it again. Take a month or 3 or 6. Whatever it takes so that you're still satisfied but finally get down to normal portion size and ideal calorie intake.

Arguing with them by saying that they take social justice way too far would only make their conviction stronger, because you're positioning yourself as the enemy and make them feel that they are fighting a worthy fight, seeing how many enemies they have to fend off.  The right thing is to fight fire with fire, in my opinion. For example in this case take a page from the book of the trans* folk recent reaction to something John Oliver did. Like, why don't we actually start listening to women speak about their own fucking issues instead of having some white liberal cis man do it for us and take away our agency? Women have been saying this shit since forever and were ignored, now this white dude ""speaks from the bottom of his heart"" and expects to be praised as our savior? White dude allies are the worst. Do you want a cookie for that? This is very problematic what you're doing here.  At worst you get them to shut up uncomfortably.

Drama,3cjseq,satanismyhomeboy,-25,Wed Jul 8 15:28:14 2015 UTC,I don't see the problem with purposefully adding some diversity to any leadership team. What harm would it do?
Drama,3cjseq,NanoGeek,23,Wed Jul 8 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Until people stop doing so, any ""minority"" in a leadership position will face accusations of being a token. As for the part you may ignore and ridicule, there's also the slight problem that it dismantles the concept of meritocracy even further and in cases like this is basically a blanket accusation of racism and sexism against people of a particular race and sex, the problem with which is the blatant self-righteous and societally condoned hypocrisy."
Drama,3cjseq,genitaliban,-16,Wed Jul 8 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"Why is it a blanket accusation? Saying ""we should make an effort to have a broader range of viewpoints in our leadership"" is hardly a bad thing.   We know from studies that people tend to not hire people that are different from them. There's no harm in trying to make leadership more representative."
Drama,3cjseq,NanoGeek,12,Wed Jul 8 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the underlying message isn't really ""we should make an effort to have a broader range of viewpoints in our leadership"".  It's more like:  ""We should totally make an effort to have a broader range of 'viewpoints' in our leadership. By which I mean, we should include people of different races and sexes. After all, we can't trust a bunch of white dudes to have varied opinions, or really to look out for anyone but themselves.* So we're going to add in people from other groups to represent correct, er, I mean, diverse ideas. Of course, it only counts if the people we bring in agree with us, because otherwise they aren't really broadening the range, right? Damn those traitors, er, I mean.... So yeah, we want as many people as possible in the leadership who are in lockstep agreement with our opinions, because more good-thinking people == more diversity == broader range of viewpoints == good and pure. It's just that simple. Sorry, what's that about an ""echo chamber for our viewpoint""? Don't be daft.""  * ""But it's totally not racist or sexist to say that! Something something institutionalized power and privilege, never mind the explicit forms of discrimination encoded into institutions like the law, official college policies, police procedures etc. Besides, looking out for oneself is what we would do, and it's pretty clearly the rational, self-interested thing to do, so of course white men can be expected to look out for white men. Wait, what do you mean, helping out someone of the same sex and race as you, isn't the same thing as helping yourself?"""
Drama,3cjseq,zahlman,-11,Wed Jul 8 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"So it's impossible to actually wish to have a broader range of diversity than ""white college-aged american male"" for any reason other than to make yourself feel better? You're assuming that no one would ever involve themselves with people who don't automatically agree with them."
Drama,3cjseq,NanoGeek,9,Wed Jul 8 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"So it's impossible    Of course not. However, it isn't happening here, and generally isn't happening when people use this sort of rhetoric. I've seen it time and time again, all over the Internet, for years."
Drama,3cjseq,zahlman,-11,Wed Jul 8 22:43:55 2015 UTC,"So if you agree that it's not impossible, why be cynical and always assume the worst of people's intentions?"
Drama,3cjseq,NanoGeek,11,Wed Jul 8 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"Because it's not an assumption; it's based on the rhetoric (the fact that the discussion is ostensibly only about the gender of the mods, but racial demographics are brought up, completely speculatively and apropos of nothing, for no plausible reason other than that it supports the ""privilege"" narrative) and the conversational context (OP doesn't even indicate how he knows none of the mods are female; plus is making this argument as a man while women in the thread are speaking up to claim they don't care).  OP argues that ""things are being missed"" (i.e. comments aren't being removed that he thinks should be removed because they're offensive to women), yet somehow insists that a female moderator would be required in order to remove such messages consistently even though he can recognize them while being male. This is strongly indicative that OP is simply buttmad that comments he thinks should be removed are not actually getting removed.  Keep in mind that the rules of the subreddit in question are already quite strict:   As well as any other hate speech of any kind is not tolerated on /r/hockey. This includes using ""you can play"" in a negative way (e.g. He was very ""you can play"" about it). Posts or comments of this type will result in a ban from /r/hockey.   I have no idea what the hell the phrase ""you can play"" supposedly has to do with any kind of hate speech."
Drama,3cjseq,zahlman,-11,Wed Jul 8 22:46:15 2015 UTC,I think his argument was that women (who are subjected to that type of insult more often) would be better able to recognize and deal with it. I don't see why that's such a bad assumption.
Drama,3cjseq,NanoGeek,8,Wed Jul 8 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"Because as a moderator in a subreddit with rules like that, ""dealing with it"" is trivial, and ""recognizing it"" is pretty objective and straightforward."

It's actually impossible. Like, logically.

There are female urologists that practice medicine on men. I guarantee they know more about dicks than you ever will other than acting like one.   Of course there are female urologists, who learned from male urologists and listened to male patients where does it hurt and so on.  My point is that there's a rather obvious fact: at some point you need to have the opinions of the people who have first-hand experience with the subject and you should treat those opinions as more important than opinions derived from them or from nothing.  Not in each individual case of course, you can have someone who has more and more reliable second-hand knowledge about some subject than most people with first-hand knowledge.  But globally there is a fact that not all opinions are equal. And one practical consequence of that fact is that you can't bootstrap judging opinions on their ""merit"". As I put it in another comment, ""[you'd have] a commission made of people who don't know how to drive that decides if some person who doesn't know how to drive either appears to be knowledgeable enough about driving.""  Somehow this pretty obvious observation makes you people really really angry, probably because you can't refute it and are reduced to name calling and pointing at female urologists as if it contradicts it.

She clearly escalated the situation to a point where it isn't illegal to hit back. FSU doesn't have to follow the strict rules of law, but the court system is supposed to. I imagine there's a strong chance these  charges will eventually be dropped by the prosecutor.   Hopefully another school will give this kid a chance next year. Given all the enormous negative press surrounding FSU it's pretty obvious why they felt they had to kick him off the team. However it would be entirely unfair for this kid to lose his chance at college solely over an overreaction  to an obnoxious combative drunk girl. Hopefully another school will give him a chance. Alabama is need of a good quarterback.  To be clear I don't think it's right that FSU expelled him. I'm only saying I understand why the felt they had to do their press coverage last year"

People in the metasphere hated Yishan because he was ""unprofessional"" (as if MetaRedditors are all Fortune 500 Directors looking for their next CEO). Plus, he was the one who announced RedditNotes and hired the guy who championed them. Yishan also forced the move to SF. And Reddit Mods complained about the lack of communication and terrible tools under him, too. The only difference is that he didn't pull the rug out from under a major default subreddit and fire a bunch of other employees.  Honestly, Yishan mostly kept to himself. Specifically, he wasn't involved in (and failed at) a gender discrimination lawsuit. Nor did he proclaim that Reddit was to be a safe space; a charged term that elicits memories of rooms with Play-Doh, coloring books, and bubbles just because some adults got their feelings hurt by people who don't agree with them (I encourage the read). Those are obviously very political issues that currently split Reddit.  At the end of the day, she's the CEO now. Obama got away with blaming Bush for the first 4 years, but Yishan wasn't quite that disliked. She can't deflect because it looks like she's playing the blame game. Obama was in some instances too, but ""Hey, remember that guy you don't like? He did this, not me!"" sells much better when people actively dislike the other guy. Pao doesn't have that luxury.  e: Oh shit, Yishan also did an Obama/Bush comparison only 3 hours before. Except I disagree because it's basically the opposing party's job to blame the one in power. Republicans complaining about Obama basically fell on deaf ears for most of Obama's first term."

I'm just curious why people think it's sexism when these protests exploded when a female employee was fired. The vast majority of the people calling out Pao were also praising Victoria. I personally dislike Ellen Pao because she closed down some subs. That's all. I believe reddit should be based around free speech and if you don't like a sub, it's as simple as ignoring it. If certain mods or users were breaking the harassment rules, they should have been the ones banned, not the entire sub (which, while I personally disapproved of it since I'm fat, I acknowledge it did have rules against brigading and all outgoing links were no participation)  Were there any big scandals like this under Yishan?"

I know what was going on in that sub and the mods definitely didn't give a shit about harassment. NP links are a fucking joke and every single moderator knows that. I think vitriolic, racist, bigoted subs have a right to exist on reddit but they should exist in an insular fashion. There are far worse subreddits that have gotten far more attention in the media that the admins didn't ban. FPH shit up the rest of reddit and so they got banned. The mods could have done a bare minimum and tried to tone down the constant user mention spam that FPH did to call out random redditers who were overweight and made the mistake of posting literally anywhere on reddit but they didn't, they liked the trolling and the attention they got what they deserved. FPH was a platform for the mod's trolling, not some bastion of free speech on the internet.   As for scandals under Yishan, there was the fappening of course. He removed all the fappening subreddits and then made a post about it with vague bullshitty reasons for the removal.

On top of that this also seems to be kind of a breaking point for those mods annoyed about the lack of communication the admins have with them and how they seem to blunder around with stuff hoping something good would stick.

Drama,3c8awf,Antigonus1i,5,Sun Jul 5 23:08:35 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia's rules are quite strict on paid contributors.  If someone makes an error in the wikipedia page about you, you're not allowed to correct it - either some other independent wikipedian will fix it soon, or you can write an angry letter to wikipedia's head office and they'll remove the libel.  Likewise, you're not allowed to pay your agent to correct use softer words about your misdeeds - if wikipedia says you cheated on your wife then your PR agency is strictly prohibited from changing the wording to say that ""the couple experienced marital difficulties"".   Wikipedia's view of PR companies is that they can get you interviews with newspapers and magazines or put you on TV with a sympathetic host. Then independent members of the public can correct your biography based on what those journalists write about you, but the PR company is not allowed to edit your bio directly.   This is the area of wikipedia's rules that covers Victoria editing the wikipedia pages of clients of the PR agency that employed her. It's probably not illegal, but it's one of the most unethical things you can do on wikipedia.   Since Victoria's sacking, one of the lines of protest has been that it was inconsiderate to the IAMA mods who depended on her. It's argued that Reddit is the product of its users' efforts, and her sacking showed that the admins didn't appreciate that.  Well, likewise Wikipedia is the product of work by many thousands of volunteers, and Victoria was apparently complicit in undermining that work, for corporate profit."

Drama,3c4c73,zxcv1992,8,Sat Jul 4 20:57:35 2015 UTC,Lets break this down.  I doubt Victoria went postal and so they fired her on the spot because she was willing to help with things afterwards.    She says she doesn't know why she was fired which is probably mostly true.  Either she has an idea like knew the situation was going bad or truly was fired on the spot.  If she knew or was fired on the spot than she represented something they needed to get rid of.    But what is important is they didn't fallout plan or a replacement.  She just got fired.  Basically this is how I see it.  They talked about it but just talked about it.  They wanted a situation change for a bit but never went into what ifs.  Nothing too deep just the bare minimum.  A couple of days ago they just said fuck it fire her and they did.  They didn't really think of the implications because since they have been mulling over it for such a long time they thought they already went through all of it.  They were wrong and it shows.  It really shows.

There are protected classes which cannot be cause for termination, ie you can't be fired because you are black, but you can be fired for no reason at all.  Many companies are comprised of professionals and will allow the employee in such a case to resign rather than be fired. Reddit, clearly, is not such a company.

These are generally people with phd's, celebrity status, peer reviewed papers... you really think they're unable to answer some quick emails about an AMA? like anyone that graduated with a science hat in the last decade doesn't know what reddit is. These are human professionals, often they're human professionals with professional public relations agents they're not shy unicorns.   It's entirely likely that the company monitors email addresses and workflow and noticed that actually Victorias job only really consisted of sending a few short emails every few days and chatting with the mods about general nonsense... They probably thought, hey why bother employing her to do that when anyone else in the office could do it on their fucking coffee break? and she always drinks out of other peoples cups and leaves them dirty....   i'm just saying, maybe we should kinda give them the benefit of the doubt for a while and see how it all pans out - if the hawking AMA goes well and general quality of AMA's stays strong then we're probably best just keeping quiet -- if everything goes to shit then sure, let slip the dogs of war and reign anarchy from shore to shore."

I have worked for big companies and small ones, and watched owners and managers make bad decisions at all of them, but holy shit -- these people make mismanagement look like an art.  They don't just screw up -- they screw up in the most colossal and hilarious ways imaginable. If they were just merely incompetent, they'd occasionally get something right (if only by accident). But their PR is so consistently terrible that at this point I would honestly characterize this as malicious mismanagement.   It's as if they employ a very good, competent PR person (or staff), consult them for advice prior to every decision with a public face to it, carefully listen to their expert guidance, and then proceed to do the exact opposite of everything they were told.  They didn't just fire their AMA liaison, they did it without notice and not only didn't bother telling the AMA folks but shafted a variety of celebrity guests at the very last minute well. I know that reddit's users are the ""product,"" so obviously we're an afterthought, but especially given reddit's desire to start doing paid AMA's it's especially stupid to screw the customers.  Then there's this drama. They don't just fire an admin for health reasons after keeping him on the payroll for a prolonged period to get better and promising not to fire him, they do it to a cancer patient. And from the looks of it, they threatened his health to get him to stop doing this AMA. Legal or not, that's simply inhuman. Threatening to sue is one thing, but threatening to stop paying for life-saving treatment (i.e. threatening to let them die) is disturbing. No healthy person does a thing like that.  I feel really bad for reddit's legal staff. They're either so incompetent that this was the best job they could get, or they're very good and must endure the sore throats they get from shouting ""shut. the. fuck. up!"" at management constantly. It has to be frustrating to be so consistently ignored by their employer.  It makes for fantastic drama, don't get me wrong, but I have no idea how reddit actually survives. Companies can't be lining up to do business with them when they can very easily see from the briefest of glimpses how at-odds the company is with its own users. I know the money people tend to ignore the plebs, but basic due diligence should warn any competent organization to stay far away.  Heh. I'm taking this too seriously.

Drama,3btphe,GenericHamburgerHelp,7,Thu Jul 2 13:37:26 2015 UTC,"Geez people, it was just a joke.  He wasn't really serious.  I was in dialogue with an obviously bad-faith interlocutor on the subject of race, who clearly wanted to bait me into saying something “offensive,” and out of frustration, I decided I’d give them something to cry about and say something really “offensive” — scare quotes intended.  Despite this assumption towards a complete stranger on the internet, Dr. Kotsko's very next paragraph begins hilariously that the only people who were offended were people who ""believe the absolute worst of a total stranger.""  Update: Writing on his site today, Dr. Kotsko accepted some fault in his comment, saying, ""It’s likely that if I had chosen to engage in dialogue rather than gotten impatient, one of my interlocutors would have volunteered the “mass suicide” consequence themselves. I decided to head them off at the pass, which in retrospect was a bad choice."""

Drama,3brqa5,TIPTOEINGINMYJORDANS,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"I get what he is saying but I dont think that really applies here. Having people of all races and backgrounds can help you dodge potential landmines. For example: In the UK Krispy Kreme donuts put on a Krispy Kreme Kontest. The twitter hashtag was KKK. Chances are if there were some black people in the board room when that decision of made, they couldve called that out before Krispy Kreme put that name out in public. So his point is valid, but not in this context.   Or another example: during IIRC the malaysian air plane frenzy, a news station posted a bogus story about people named dumb shit like Sum Ting Wong. If there were some Asian people in the producers room while they decided whether or not to run the story, they wouldve had a better chance to pick up on the prank."
