Journalism,3e2zb4,PM_ME_YOUR_PHHHT,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:11 2015 UTC,"Try your best to answer some of those questions yourself through research. For instance, your first one. If the business has a website go on there first to see if it answers how long the owners have had it and where it started.   As well, some of your questions that deal with the area at an earlier time could generally be answered through some research on the town itself. You should still ask your subject this question about its perception, but it will give you a better frame of reference and help to keep the interview going.  Whenever I interview someone, I try to do as much research as I can about the subject or area we're talking about this way I can give some responses and different talking points so it is more of a conversation."
Journalism,3e2zb4,OatmealisForSnowmen,2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will get researching and try to find otu as much as possible on the potential business I hope to interview first. I am also hoping that can refine these questions a bit mroe after my first few interviews.   I was thinking about testing it out on my boss first. We work off of this road I am writing about and my boss has been here for about 18 years. I just don't know if he will be inclined to conduct an interview for a non work related project. He is a stickler.
Journalism,3e2zb4,OatmealisForSnowmen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I think testing it our on your boss first might be a great first step and also, given how long he's been in that area, a nice perspective. You should ask him to do it during a lunch break or after work if he's worried.   When you reach out to people for interviews make sure you specify that face to face would be best, but work with what you can. After that, Skype, phone and finally email. The trouble with email is that it gives people a longer time to respond and tailor their answers and you want an interview to be  a little more candid. By doing one face to face, you're getting their initial reaction and facial expression,mannerisms and tone, which are great details to a story."

That story has irreparably damaged their reputation, especially editorially. The mistake they made was not officially retracting and apologizing. Denton's follow up made it more clear that it wasn't just a business decision that motivated the story's removal.    The writer's takes as they go up are naive, arrogant, and continue to miss the point the world is yelling at them: you fucked up.   These editors are falling on their swords because others in the company had the good sense to do what the editors were too arrogant to contemplate: admitting a tragic mistake."

For the good of the company, the writers, the editors -- everyone.  If I have a rule that the dog isn't allowed into my bedroom, but I'm having a god damn stroke and my dick is on fire... I really hope my dog will come into my bedroom to save me.  They're falling over themselves on this terrible ethical breach... all while ignoring what necessitated it. The editors and writers are going out of their way to put a throw-away sentence or two:  ""(This isn’t the place to debate the merits of that story, other than to say that I stand by the post.)""  And then going on for a few thousand words about how awfully they've been violated.

No doubt over deeply principled issues. ಠ_ಠ  But regardless of the actual reasons, that is what people will see. One festering swamp flinging alligators into a hivemind of scum and villainy.  Were there back-channel communications? Dunno. But it would not be outside of the realm of possibility that people at Conde' Nast took this very personally. They may have communicated that this was no longer, ""nothing personal, just business.""  But never mind that. It may have happened, it may have not. But the perception of a vicious media feud  is what will annoy readers and scare advertisers - and that's not just true for Gawker - it could affect Conde' Nast, too.

I made the decision to go with an internship that was right for me even after accepting another. When I told the first editor he wasn't pleased. Luckily I managed to work something out with the state press association and get the guy more time to find an intern. He probably hates me now, but going with that better internship was a great move and now I'm working at a bigger city instead of somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. I battled internally over it, but I don't regret it."

Journalism,3dw86c,Damaso21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:29:39 2015 UTC,High. The truth is that international work is very competitive and hard work. Most people spend years as local and domestic reporters before they get to international. Certainly you need a very strong writing style and some experience. Remember there are dozens of Aussies trying to do the same thing in London or New York and have more experience and better contacts.  That said if its what you want to do then do it. Moving to where you want to report from is smart. In fact its what I did out of school but at that point I already had several years of freelance experience and some international assignments under my belt. But you really need some solid experiences and clips. People need to know that you can actually write before they will take a chance on you as a freelancer. If you really want to get work the best bet is to go someplace that's under covered but that you believe readers and editors at home will be interested in.  Good luck!

I'm more than willing to cede that he's a public figure, after all he is a c-suite executive in an influential media company.  But do Conde Nast investors care? Do his bosses? Well, as far as we know, he didn't use company resources to facilitate the rendezvous, nor did he use his influence. This guy was a gay porn star, not his subordinate. This isn't Dov Charney essentially using underaged employees as stress relief.  Do social activists care? Is he outspoken against homosexuality? This has been the reasoning used in the past to out conservative politicians and others, but we know nothing about Geithner's politics aside from the fact he's related to a former treasury secretary. And it's not as if he works for a company that's outspoken against homosexuality, either. Conde Nast publishes magazines like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, a far cry from the National Review.  And even his wife, we can't really be sure she even cares. Maybe they has an open marriage. Maybe she gets off to him being with other guys. And if he is a cheating dirtbag? I fail to see how this is in the public interest. If it was, your local weekly would run a cheaters section right next to the classifieds, real estate transactions and legal notices.  Ask yourself again...who the hell cares? The answer is people for whom schadenfreude is a news value.

The modules generally had a one hour lecture and a two hour tutorial/practical, so around 9 hours of in-class  work. This changed throughout the years. For example, with Broadcast modules we would do mock news-days meaning that you would be in all day.  The rest of the time is spent outside class. Preparing for news-days would take up a lot of time and frankly the practicals on things such as In-Design, Avid etc were woefully short, you will have to practice this stuff on your own. You'll also be expected to get as much work exp as possible, write etc out-with classes (something I wish I'd done a lot more of, it's kinda screwing me atm).

In my two-year converged journalism program (which I graduated from in June), I had class almost every single day. Some days were classes from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (with breaks in between) while others had one class for three hours. I also had a lot of class rearrangements (due to a long period of depression which took until last month to get proper medications for) on top of that.  I also stayed at the school a lot outside of class for multiple reasons.  First, every Friday, we had a mandatory Converged Day where everyone had to be there to have their stories edited for the school's newspaper (circulation: 1,000) or for our news organization's website. We had four print days a semester, so most people skipped Converged Day almost every week.  Second, twice a year, we had something called Blitz Day. Blitz Day is basically a day where you have to find a story, interview your sources, get photos, write your story, get it edited and published in one day (Basically what most daily newspapers have to do). The first-year students wrote the stories while the second years worked as editors.  Third, every Tuesday night, the program has its live 30-minute newscast. It's broadcast live on my area's community cable channel live, one of four programs worldwide (apparently) to do so on television. I remember being told half the shows in Year 2 were 'The Justin Show' because a lot of people didn't hand in their stories (each semester, we were required to have four TV stories made a semester in Year 2. Most didn't do that). I volunteered a lot for it in Year 1 and a little in Year 2. They also have short newscasts every day at 1 p.m. live as well.  Now I'm heading into its optional third-year program (it's called Media Convergence. If you want a job in the area, you need to take it) which, although there's less class time, you have to work harder because of what's at stake.

But definitely put those awards on your resume, work on that resume everyday and keep in contact with good references that you can list. Make several resumes and cover letters depending on where you apply. Make yourself seem super adaptable. And while you're free and have spare time, keep making basic videos even if they are about something simple or dumb. That way you keep your chops up and you can keep adding things to your repertoire. Also, perhaps the most important, is find a website that will allow you to produce a professional-grade online portfolio. I use clippings.me but there are others.

Journalism,3de3kd,UltravioletClearance,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"You're in a much better spot than me. I graduated a month ago with only one year of experience at my college's paper and no internships (ended up changing majors in my 3rd year from engineering which fucked me over, leaving no time for anything except struggling to graduate on time).  Got a job 3 weeks later at a local weekly. It's part-time but I figure it will have to do for experience.   I guess my best advice is to take what you can get. Don't be afraid to take a part-time position especially fresh out of college. If you're working locally and can live at home, that should keep your costs of living low enough for it to be economically viable. Journalism is an extremely competitive field with more graduates vying for fewer job openings.   Seeing as you worked at your college paper, did you make any contacts with anyone from local papers or news outlets? I only worked my college paper for a year but I got to know the reporter who covers the college beat for the local paper and several TV news reporters because I always covered the big events that got media attention. I even met the owner of the biggest newspapers in the area at an event once. Didn't help me as much as I hoped because they tend to only hire experienced journalists, but they helped point me in the right direction and gave advice on who to apply to."

NPR has summer/spring/fall/winter internships. Try applying to those. Having a reputable news org on your resume can often get you interviews/call backs, even if you don't get hired. I really wish I would've done more internships. I was a dummy and put it off until my last year of undergrad, when it was REQUIRED. It is tough. I thought about abandoning the field altogether, but there's nothing that excites me as much as journalism. I live in Los Angeles, btw, and I'm currently doing comms work at a non-profit, which is still kind of relevant, but not my favorite. Sometimes you just have to stick it out until you finally land something. Also, in retrospect, it's very much about who you know. I landed this comms job because I knew someone. And that's specially true in journalism. Make connections. Be visible! I'm a shy person so this kind of bit me in the ass. But push yourself to make connections and talk to people. They might know of openings and might be willing to give you a reference. That's been my experience so far.   Some background: Struggling freelancer in LA. Been a fill-in at a local NPR-affiliate, which has worked wonders for my resume. I started out as an intern and was eventually asked to come back. I majored in print, but ended up in radio.

But if you can land a gig in your desired place, more power to you.  As for the beat, I'd recommend looking for general assignment or area reporting (pretty much the same thing as general). Those two beats will give you the broadest experience to help you narrow in on what you'd like to specialize in."

I'm working for a metro daily that's just gone through its ninth round of layoffs.  Our newsroom is at one third the staffing level of 10 years ago. The future of the newspaper business is bleak, so tomorrow's journalists should develop skills that will help them move beyond it.  Videography, social media and multi-media story telling will be as important to tomorrow's reporter as gumshoe reporting and writing skills.  Learn data analysis -- there's a demand for it in newsrooms. Don't confine your search to newspapers.  The future is on the web in in the ap. Consider radio and news-oriented trade and specialty websites.  If you land on a local newspaper, think of it it a place to hone your skills for a move to an area of journalism with a future. Consider a specialty in business journalism and its subspecialties (health business, energy reporting and so on).   The business wires -- Dow Jones, Reuter, Bloomberg -- pay well and will prosper as newspapers decline. It also opens opportunity in the trade journals, some of which pay surprisingly well and provide interesting work.  I've known people who did a term at trades such as he Bond Buyer or the American Banker and ended up on the Wall Street Journal -- one of the few newspapers with a decent future. You may well find yourself spending a year or so in low-pay internships. They are good stepping stones in this depressing market for journalists.

I accepted this job and then got six more offers to interview immediately after.  Have a lot of skills. I got hired here in part because I'm good with basic programming and video and journalism. I did TV reporting on a lark and it turned out to be really useful for getting hired.  In this order, journalists care about experience, clips and where you went to school when hiring. Have a lot of clips that show good reporting.  Don't be afraid to take a not-ideal job. I interviewed at a tiny town of 10,000 in Mississippi.

True enough for politicians, but Garrett proves adept at this as well; both begging the question and setting up a straw man.   Garrett doesn't ask if the President is ""content"" with the captives' situation. He asserts it, then builds his question around that premise. It's no different than ""when did you stop beating your wife?"" The whole idea that being pleased with the nuclear deal means the President is content with the other situation is a straw man.  Beyond that, if this was an actual question, and not a right-wing talking point with a question mark at the end, how would one even answer it?  ""Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content with all the fanfare around this deal to leave the conscience of this nation, the strength of this nation, unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans?""  Um, can you rephrase the question? Is ""the conscience and strength of the nation"" Fox news speak for ""soldiers"" or something? What does that even mean?

That same politician took a run at being the premier, and for reasons unknown she didn't have to take a leave of absence during the campaign. Our newsroom thought it was a little odd, but the couple went to great lengths to keep their marriage fairly hidden from the public eye."

I've been fortunate enough to have written a few op-eds about a beat in which i've worked deeply for many years, and editors seem to think my background brings a level of analysis to the issue absent in other discussions of that subject. So many op-ed columnists just pick a subject, read one or two ""experts,"" and pound out a jeremiad. We really need no more of that nonsense, especially in the era of blogs in which everyone who has an opinion, well-founded or not, can blare it to the public. Set yourself apart by being a person who knows your stuff and backs your arguments up with well-researched figures.

Yes, it doesn't have give you a degree upon completion of the journalism program or its optional third-year program media convergence (which I'm going into in September) (The Ontario provincial government doesn't allow colleges to give degrees unless it's a four year program. The journalism and media convergence programs may merge to create a three-year program in the near future), but it also teaches you everything from print to radio/TV to design to photojournalism.  Basically, it allows you to find what you're most interested in and learn everything you need to know once you go out into the working world.

Think about where you want to be in terms of your career, then go find the school best suited to get you there. Mizzou won't always be the answer.   For example, if you want to work in print specifically, Mizzou isn't even the best program in this state, let alone this country. If you want to work in broadcast, it can't be beaten.

I'm a senior at the University of Central Arkansas, broadcast journalism major. It's by no means one of those top-notch J-schools, but it does have the opportunity angle going for it. You can jump in to all the application programs as a first-semester freshman and start learning via doing. Of course, the final product has to go through a few editing filters before being published, but if employers are looking for experience, you'll get 4-ish years of it, not to mention the required internship. Everything's very student-run, but the professors are seasoned professionals and are excellent advisers.  If you get into broadcast, there are three Market 56 stations just a short drive away in Little Rock. They're pretty indicative of what you'll encounter at a first or second job.  Anyway, don't sell yourself short by not trying for something like Mizzou (I graduated HS with a guy who's now one of the KOMU sports anchors/reporters), but there are options that don't get advertised as much that are pretty good."

Thus it engenders a bit of exclusivity and a strong sense of community.   There are two great and active student newspapers, one of which (the Daily Cardinal) is the sixth oldest in the nation and I know several students who would say it's their favorite part of college.

By offering everyone a really sophisticated article editor that allows for complete ease of expression and a rich framework for production, and by providing tools that pinpoint audiences so that the stakeholders of content are reached, we seek to level the playing field for anyone with something newsworthy to say.   We are actually a team composed of people with backgrounds in various fields, from communications and creative writing to mathematical statistics and machine learning. Based on in-house analysis, motivated by existing literature on the matter, we have found that much of the established system (i.e., the binary system of likes/dislikes, up/down) is fraught with heavy information loss, and moreover serves as a poor proxy for newsworthiness and reliability, thereby causing misleading inferences of relative social value between content.

It looks pretty amateur-ish and wouldn't make me want to use your service. I don't like the moving background, and frankly the typography is pretty awful.  Also, none of the text on the site really makes it clear what this is supposed to be. Is it a news site that hosts content, where I can go and read the news, or is it a platform like Storify that I would use to build and embed articles on my own site?   My biggest question right now is: why should I use it?  Maybe I'm not your target audience, but here's my thought process...I work at a newspaper. Our website is a ""platform for creating and sharing our stories,"" and we have in-house article editing tools that allow us to ""customize our creations.""   We have whole departments of people whose job is to ""target our audience,"" and we already get revenue from advertising and clicks and all that. So all that being said, what's in it for me (or my paper) to use Newzlet?"
Journalism,3cz73z,TeoLolstoy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks so much for your feedback--we're working on a redesign of layout/message right now.   Now to your questions:  1) It's a platform to do both--we host original content and provide functionality to post elsewhere.   2) You very well might not be a primary user of our service, given all of the resources at your disposal at your level of professionalism. However, that being said, even in our current nascent stage we already have an article editor that eclipses anything else out there on the web right now.   Moreover, the ability we offer to really pinpoint the stakeholders of content is extremely granular--imagine getting your article to people according to where they went to school, what they studied, what their political or spiritual beliefs are, what they do for a living, where they live, how old they are,... One caveat is that this degree of targeting is only for refining readership on our site, at least for now.  As far as monetization goes: Because we offer this deep-level audience targeting, and because we do so for free, you should post content to our site because it will allow you to accrue marginal profit at a rate greater you would promoting it, at cost, on Facebook, google, etc., to these refined groups even considering our share in ad and subscription proceeds. Moreover, Newzlet also acts as a platform for organizations to conduct ""variable pricing"", which means organizations can sell content to people who may never have seen it in the first place due to price discrimination."

I got way more experience out of writing for my college newspaper and eventually writing for news sites on top of that. Taking a few classes here and there was helpful, but my coworkers who majored in the subject found the courses overlapped what they were gaining from publishing their work outside the classroom.  Honestly, what you study in college doesn't matter as much as the work you crank out as a student. But, what is useful is finding peers and mentors to work with. My college newspaper was published weekly, so I was working on stories fairly regularly on top of my studies. Just keep writing and fill your clips with as beats from many different angles.   A few of my buds majored in political science because they knew from the get-go they wanted to cover policy. Others went into business (like myself) to get a bit of information about sports journalism.   Get to know the support staff.

Additionally, there is little expectation of privacy when it comes to a player's health, probably the only meaningful part of any NFL press conference are the injury updates.

It can take the data and turn out a readable article, but who is telling it what data to look at?  To me a journalist isn't just someone who can write. It's someone who knows the right questions to ask and has the discernment to filter out the unimportant information while exploring the important information. The writing part is just the organization of the facts, it's the compiling and investigating those facts that's essential.  This program can take data and turn it into an article much like a machine in a factory can take ingredients and make a chocolate cupcake. But I can't imagine there's a machine out there that can imagine a new combination of flavors that might be good and then produce a new, better dessert. Similarly, I think we're a long way from a program that has the intuition and/or interface to go out and gather the facts in an investigation.  Good reporting and storytelling has much to do with understanding how people are. It's that empathetic tone that's used in interview to earn an interviewees trust, and then the understanding that patiently waiting after her answer might yield another answer. It's reading the body language of somebody to understand not only just what's being said, but what's being meant. It's respecting the nuances and contexts of cultures and language...  I think it's cool that a program can take weather data, or sports statistics, and turn that into an article. But I think we're a long way from replacing quality reporters with a machine."

Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1464, prohibits the utterance of any obscene, indecent or profane language by means of radio communication. Consistent with a subsequent statute and court case, the Commission's rules prohibit the broadcast of indecent material during the period of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. FCC decisions also prohibit the broadcast of profane material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Civil enforcement of these requirements rests with the FCC, and is an important part of the FCC's overall responsibilities. At the same time, the FCC must be mindful of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 326 of the Communications Act, which prohibit the FCC from censoring program material, or interfering with broadcasters' free speech rights.   For now, that leaves streaming video off the list."
Journalism,3ciouz,Facepalms4Everyone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:02:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I was looking for people's personal opinions on the topic, not really what the legislation says. I mean, when you're at the beach then the people around you are also at the beach with their bodies showing; but if someone takes a photo and it's posted online it's as if you were going topless around town.  I don't know, I wouldn't like it if someone took pictures of me while I'm at the beach. I know journalists don't need any more censorship laws, but sometimes it seems like they abuse their rights for no good reason."
Journalism,3ciouz,Facepalms4Everyone,8,Wed Jul 8 06:40:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, if the photographer went out of their way to center the boobs in the frame and really make it clear someone there was topless, that's obviously too far. But if someone's in the background getting rid of tan lines, well then, they're in public, you're in public. If you go to a public beach and pull your boobs out, you have to do so expecting that you could be photographed, as both you and the photographer would be in a public place.  I wouldn't necessarily like someone taking photos of me at the beach, either, but if that's not allowed, then by the same logic, a photographer couldn't take take pictures of a house from the street because the owner didn't want them to.  I'm sure most public beaches have rules about that kind of nudity, and private beaches can bar photography for whatever reason."
Journalism,3ciouz,Facepalms4Everyone,2,Wed Jul 8 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"The newspaper in question (I don't want to link to it because I know the person who was photographed) posted around 30 pictures and 5 of those where of her as she walked topless along the beach. None of them were closeups yet they leave little to the imagination. It seems excessive and unnecessary, specially to report a heat wave.  I understand that it's legal to take those pictures, but you can't compare someone photographing your home to someone photographing intimate parts of your body. I also understand that if you go to a public beach and bare your body then you must expect that others are going to see it, and it would be stupid to get annoyed if someone looked at you; but at the same time I realize that much fewer women would go topless at the beach if they knew a photographer would take pictures of them and post them on the news for potentially everyone to see. I find it hard to explain this, but being naked in public doesn't mean you're naked for the whole public. This is the reason many nudist beaches look down on those who attend a nudist beach with a swimsuit on, it's like a social contract that says ""you can see me naked as long as I can see you naked, that way you won't make fun of me because I'll be able to make fun of you"". Another example would be at a japanesse Sentō (a communal bath house where everyone is naked); would people be wrong to be offended at someone taking pictures of them? After all, they are naked in public.  Regarding my friend whom I saw topless on the news, it feels wrong for me to look at those photos because the only way I would have seen her like that would be if I had also been at the beach wearing not much clothing, and in that case I'm almost sure she would have shyly covered up her breasts, specially if I tried taking a photo of her! But instead of a glimpse I got a photo I can share with other people and blackmail her with (I'd never do this, but it's a lot of power to have over a person). As legal as it is, it really doesn't seem the least bit ethical"
Journalism,3ciouz,Facepalms4Everyone,2,Wed Jul 8 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to explain this, but being naked in public doesn't mean you're naked for the whole public.   Separating the definition of public into different categories such as this can create a slippery slope such that any public instance can be covered by an exception. That's why I don't like it as a generality.  I sympathize with your argument, and I question the ethics of both the photographer and the editors who chose to publish the photos (if indeed there were editors) in this specific instance. I agree that it is excessive and unnecessary in reporting a heat wave.  The problem lies in recourse. Sure, this paper could be shamed and have complaints written to it, but that's about the extent of it. There's no legal recourse available. As to your questions about public bathhouses or locker rooms, I think The Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 addresses the legality (I would definitely agree it's unethical to photograph someone in a changing room; this act makes it illegal, too):    Sec. 1801. Video voyeurism  (a) Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, has the intent to capture an image of a private area of an individual without their consent, and knowingly does so under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.  (b) In this section —  (3) the term ""a private area of the individual"" means the naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breast of that individual;  (5) the term ""under circumstances in which that individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" means —   (A) circumstances in which a reasonable person would believe that he or she could disrobe in privacy, without being concerned that an image of a private area of the individual was being captured; or (B) circumstances in which a reasonable person would believe that a private area of the individual would not be visible to the public, regardless of whether that person is in a public or private place.    So, if you're on a public beach, and you go topless, and you're not in a changing room or any other area where you would have a reasonable expectation of privacy (meaning, if you know that other beach-goers can see you plainly), then you should expect that someone may show up and photograph you, and it would be legal for them to do so. That doesn't make it ethical, necessarily, but there's little recourse for that."

You don't have to be 100% honest, no one is in job interviews, but don't outright say you have qualifications you don't have. If you say you can do something, they will ask you to do it. And if you can't deliver something you promised, it kills any trust you had with that potential employer.  That aside, it's best to just to start writing. I'd advise going on something like Google News and reading several articles in the Tech section (since it sounds the closest to what you'd be writing for.) Don't read for content though, read for style. Try to imitate that as best you can when you write, and as YouthfulPhotographer said, look up the AP Style guide.

Intimidation, nepotism, his name on every public building in town, things like that.

I get there for my first day, and the editor tells me at the last meeting the council voted to spend $20k to keep open a daycare run by his mother. That was the conversation.  Our relationship wasn't helped by the fact that the Southern hick publisher would run these opinion columns that just tore apart everything he did, and bordered on racist because he only wrote about the dumb shit the local Mexican politicians did while glossing over the dumb shit the white politicians did.  Mr. Publisher carried a revolver with him when he drove to the city council meetings and left it under the car seat because he couldn't take it in the meeting. The danger was probably real because the mayor's two idiot sons were very involved in the local criminal scene.  A few highlights off the top of my head: The mayor would regularly hold up our paper during council meetings and rant about what a shame it was, the stuff we wrote about him.  They built a big-ass skate park because they stumbled into some grant money. The mayor's son was installed as security as an independent contractor. When the mayor lost his majority, the council discussed terminating the contract, and the son got up and ranted about how they owed him overtime.  The townspeople wanted a police department. City manager wanted a PD. Council wanted a PD. Mayor did not.  He disbanded it in the 80s, asking why they were paying officers to drink in the orchards. He fought the creation of a new PD tooth and nail.  He and a crony were kicked out of the polling place on election day, along with people from his opponent's camp. It wasn't a mayoral election, but the seats up for reelection decided his majority. Reps from both sides showed up as election observers, and I guess he was being overbearing, trying to weasel his way into helping people who don't speak English.
