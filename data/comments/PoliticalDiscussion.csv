PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,dovetc,44,Tue Jul 21 16:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm stationed at Fort Hood and was here for the most recent shooting, so I can provide some insight. The military is a highly centralized institution that has a very ""top-down"" system for dealing with risk in everything they do. Outside of actual combat, the military is extremely risk-averse in all garrison operations because commanders are responsible for all actions of their Soldiers - on and off post. That's why we have commanders dictating exact rules of behavior and taking strict measures to mitigate risk - it's why we can lawfully forbid Soldiers from talking with spouses if they've had domestic disturbances and we can strip away all their firearm and freedoms. It protects the command. This is why we don't carry firearms, one poor decision by Joe to discharge his weapon on post and everyone is fired. Although it may be a realistic method for protecting ourselves in an active shooter scenario, it cannot be considered a valid preventative method by our command because they have no control over it. The military is a politically correct highly bureaucratic system that won't accept any level of risk than they need to."

PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,Johnny_Horsecock,10,Tue Jul 21 22:44:56 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, most military organizations, especially the Marines, have an extraordinary Alpha Male mindset. Fights break out amongst servicemembers constantly. Also, it's an extremely stressful operating environment. Imagine the young soldier or Marine who's getting screamed at by his Sergeant for screwing up something...he's probably pissed that he's getting yelled at, even though he actually did screw up. Give him a gun, though...and who knows? Maybe he gets tired of getting yelled at and tries to shoot his leaders...or just shoots himself. Arming all service members on an installation because we might get attacked is like fighting a grease fire with a bucket of water...you would think it'd work, but you'd just burn the house down."
PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,Xanathin,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"But then how can you expect these same people to operate effectively and professionally in a combat situation?

I'm assuming that the military members you're talking about have already passed background checks, completed basic, and have been screened too."
PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,Johnny_Horsecock,12,Tue Jul 21 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"Police carry weapons at a police station because it is part of their job to carry a weapon and they work from the station. Soldiers fight wars and there is no war to fight in garrison or at the recruitment office. Not to mention that not all soldiers are equally proficient in weapons training. soldiers have many jobs. ""Financial Warriors"" may only shoot their weapon twice a year? That isn't a lot of practice. Soldiers make mistakes all the time with negligent discharges and forgetting their weapon someplace. Also, no one wants to wake up at 0400 for weapons drawl and then stay several hours after work cleaning and turning weapons back in. Even with controls in place shit happens, like what happened in my last unit.. http://www.stripes.com/news/german-police-kill-u-s-soldier-who-took-ex-girlfriend-hostage-near-schweinfurt-1.76416"
PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,spcguts,8,Tue Jul 21 23:19:01 2015 UTC,"It's the same risk as someone shooting up a convenience store, or a movie theater. A local business owner may have a firearm policy that allows prions and employees to lawfully conceal carry. Individual recruiting centers, however, can't make that call - it would have to go all the way up the flagpole to the Pentagon, where a senior leader will have to put his entire career on the line to endorse arming these servicemen. They can't decentralize the risk, they own all the consequences of letting Joe bring his rifle or pistol to the job. It's too politically sensitive and high risk for our military leaders to endorse.  The only thing I can think of being approved are putting military police in place at these centers. It's the common sense, brief-able risk mitigation solution that could be endorsed, but I'm not sure the risk is actually high enough to start doing that."

IIRC, in some states it's actually illegal for a landlord to disallow a tenet to have firearms where local law permits them to otherwise. On top of that, there's plenty of stores where carrying guns is normal (gun stores, those employees are almost always packing) or very common (jewelry stores).   On top of that, even if a landlord did have a problem with most potential businesses having firearms on the property, and was allowed to bar their presence legally, I'm assuming most would make an exception for the U.S. Military."
PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,OHhokie1,6,Tue Jul 21 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"The laws your referring to are about residences.  Owners are certainly allowed to prohibit firearms on their premises. Most shopping malls do so. It's also why you do not see many gun stores in them. The reason they do so is it simplifies their lives and significantly lowers their insurance premiums. The other big hurdle would be legal. At recruiting centers, the military has to follow all the local regulations, because it is not a military instalation. Thus, the standard MP pistol on the belt would send the soldier to prison in Texas, where open carry is illegal."

And if it was something the military really wanted they could move the centers they have in locations that wouldn't allow guns.  Also, on the OC thing, that's only referring to in public. You can OC all you want on your own property in Texas afaik. So as long as they only OCd inside the store they'd be fine.  At the end of the day I just think any legal or property issues would be solvable, even if they were a bit of a pain in the ass. It's just whether or not it's a good idea in the first place is what's worth discussing."
PoliticalDiscussion,3e31td,OHhokie1,-4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:33 2015 UTC,I agree that they could probably find a way to do it if they really wanted to. The problem is that the centers would end up in less desirable locations and probably be charged higher rents. I doubt the Pentagon would consider the decline in recruiting effectiveness and increases in cost as worth arming recruiters.

And I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord, and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father [and the Son];     who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spake by the Prophets.

The doctrine of the Trinity evolved over time as the Alexandrine Christian response to the Arian doctrine. The Council of Nicaea determined that Christ and God were separate yet unified, each fully God-- in the 4th century AD/CE.   In terms of Jesus as the Son of God, and therefore divine, we are also all called children of God in the Bible. There is nothing concrete in the Bible that states the doctrine of the Trinity or that says Jesus is God. Many say he is the Son of God or that he is the path to God (which would make sense if he was a prophet)... but not that Jesus is the same as God.   I'm not expecting nor trying to convince you of this. It has taken me awhile and lots of soul-searching to reluctantly give up a belief I was raised to have. I sort of see myself as a closet Unitarian Christian because people have a knee-jerk reaction of ""that means you aren't Christian."" But why would that be so, when you look at history and at the text itself and see that the Trinity doctrine is really man's creation centuries after the birth of Jesus?

If you're interested in economic effects of immigration, you can find a decent lit review in this comment.  Immigrants tend to have a positive effect on employment and wages for native workers, largely due to the fact that they bring skills to areas that lack them.  Immigrants also commit crimes at far lower rates than native citizens do (see here and here).  The process of immigration tends to self-select for people with low propensity to commit crimes - Donald Trump's statements on this topic are quite literally the opposite of the truth.  There is very little downside to greatly expanding legal immigration - one of the reasons why economists overwhelmingly support much larger amounts of immigration.  It's hard to think of an issue with a greater divide between what is popularly believed and what is shown in the literature.  So, does that mean that people oppose immigration due to racism?  Not necessarily... but I think it's naive to think that people would have problems with immigration from a poor country filled with mainly white people.    Referring to what your wife said in particular, I want to revisit the immigrant-crime relationship.  Immigrants commit crimes at a rate about 1/5 of native-born people, yet Donald Trump gets political points from calling Mexican immigrants rapists.  He is able to score points by slandering an entire class of people with brown skin, and doing so in complete contradiction to all the available evidence on the topic.  Do you really think that racism plays no part in his rise?"

That's not exactly what OP said, though. ""Limiting immigration"" is kind of vague and it can mean anything from allowing lower numbers of immigrants to not having open borders. ""Securing the border"" is a goal for absolutely everyone who doesn't believe it should be completely open, which is a vast majority of policymakers, experts and citizens.     I think it's naive to think that people would have problems with immigration from a poor country filled with mainly white people.   They absolutely would and did. That country used to be Poland, Russia, Germany, Italy and Ireland, and these immigrants were vilified in their day.   Do you really think that racism plays no part in his rise?

As we can all clearly tell, Mexicans look different than the average white American. If it were Canadians, we wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at them, but when we see light brown-skinned folk, we know they most likely have heritage south of the border. In the United States, racism usually occurs between folks of different skin color, so the association of white skin and light brown skin with racism is not uncommon. We don't hear too much about racism between Americans an Canadians.  As for our immigration policies, I think if we are going to have tighter border security (which I support), we also need a simpler, less drawn out path to citizenship (which I also support).

I want a secure border, and I write my Senators and Congressman demanding that they enforce existing law.  For those who don't agree, work to change the law.

That's a pretty mainstream Republican stance. That would not have drawn nearly the amount of backlash as his actual remarks. What he instead said was   “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”   First, he implies that somehow the Mexican government is ""sending"" these people. Then, he paints the vast majority of Mexican immigrants as rapists, drug dealers, and criminals. And he backs off the pedal a little bit by saying ""And some, I assume, are good people."" He's not even really sure about that last part. These statements about the high crime rate of Mexican immigrants are also not backed up by fact - aside from the initial illegal act of crossing the border, all data on this subject indicates that undocumenteed immigrants do not commit crime at any higher rate than natively born Americans. Trump's race-baiting statements don't even have a basis in fact.  That is not talk about the need to secure borders. That is straight up racism.  He also Tweeted something like ""Jeb Bush has to like illegal Mexicans because of his wife.""  This isn't some reasoned policy proposal about increased border security, enforcement of immigration laws, and possible examining the legal immigration process to cut out some red tape to incentivize legal immigration. It's race baiting, and it's shot Donald Trump to the top of the polls."

The problem is every so now and then someone gets a hold of the pulpit and insists not only do they need to build a fence, but that everyone who crossed illegally should be deported for reasons real or imagined. It's that type of hyper nativist sentiment that hits the airwaves. Not to mention, if someone like Trump grabs the pulpit, it gives the Dems their own pulpit to say to Latino voters: ""The Republicans are racist xenophobes who will kick your family out of the country if they get elected. But don't worry! We got your back and if you vote for us, we will guarantee legal status and citizenship for you and your family""  Also, it's been a long ingrained concept that America is a nation of immigrants dating back to its colonial past and that diversity and inclusion of all people regardless of culture and nationality is a common liberal sentiment."

Keeping them out is a half-assed way of keeping from addressing the real issue, Mexico can sometimes be the kind of place you'd want to escape.

The Democrat party and their race baiting is quickly becoming the boy who cried wolf.  When there is legitimate racism such as in our justice system, address it, but the constant cries of racism not only turn people like me off that would be in agreement with you, it completely turns off your conservative counterparts who get accused of being racist assholes for something that isn't race driven which in turn makes what little chance there would be of a compromise to address our immigration system even less politically feasible. If you call a guy a bunch of shitty names, they aren't going to be very likely to want to work with you.

I come to the immigration issue from a bit different angle however.  I hate line jumpers.  All of them, from movie lines to people who swipe a dropped number at a DMV, to immigration cheats.  We have a right as a nation to decide who and how many people get in. We have people who have waited in line for years to get in, and they must feel like real suckers for doing so, given how many people jump their place in line.

Take look at Ballotpedia's 'on the issues' match for Kasich vs. Huntsman. Ok, he's got the Federal Assaults Rifle Ban in the 90s and took ACA money in Ohio, but that only makes him a moderate Republican and pragmatic governor, not the amorphous blob that was Huntsman's public persona. I also think the fact that Huntsman was something of a slightly-more-moderate clone of Romney hurt, while Kasich will stand out a bit in this crowd—probably similarly placed on the spectrum as Bush, but a very different personality and background.  I still see him as a very long shot against a more conventionally conservative Walker, more well-known Bush and more likable Rubio, but I could see a surprising surge if he can just keep his head above water long enough to make a splash in some primaries after Iowa and New Hampshire."

The right didn't like him for visceral/image reasons, like    He spoke Chinese He was willing to serve as an Ambassador under Obama He was willing to vocally defy the base on evolution, climate change which are symbolic hot-button issues   In this respect Kasich and Christie are already a lot like Huntsman.

I mean, of course we could say there's a 95% chance that a Republican wins the Republican nomination, but when it comes to saying that any given three candidates account for more than ~75% likelihood of taking the nomination I'd hesitate at this point.

Think about it like Perry and Romney in 2012. Perry really did stand a decent chance of outflanking Romney if he hadn't tripped over himself in the debates. If you bet Romney you were taking a risk.

The ""regressive"" comment is an interesting what of looking at it, and I can certainly understand why you could feel that way. The conservative perspective is that ""leaping forward,"" shall we say, can result in disastrous policy outcomes, and that instead we should take small, measured steps conserving what works while respecting where we came from. I am pro-gay marriage, and that's largely because I've been exposed to the LGBTQ community for a long time, but I understand others on the right will feel differently."

His large budget cuts in general, which indicate he believes in supply side economics to an unhealthy degree.  His support for Wisconsin's voter ID law.  Defunding Planned Parenthood, and requiring women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound.  Scott Walker has shown a near total adherence to conservative ideology, and that would get him labelled ""extreme"" in my book.   The conservative perspective is that ""leaping forward,"" shall we say, can result in disastrous policy outcomes, and that instead we should take small, measured steps conserving what works while respecting where we came from.

I realize some of them have to pay lip-service to those parts of the base in order to have any chance of surviving the primaries, but there's little question that some of them actually believe what they're saying.  To be perfectly honest, I don't think that any conservative Republicans are really interested in ""conservatism"" in the sense you specify here. Everything from their reckless endorsement of foreign wars in the Bush era, to their staunch refusal to do anything about climate change, to their wanton ambivalence to the erosion of civil liberties (Rand gets a pass here, and most Democrats are guilty here too), to their refusal to recognize that ""free trade"" and supply-side economics don't work anymore (if they ever did), strikes me as the very antithesis of wanting to ""conserve"" the functional aspects of our society and economy.

Gallup shows that while slightly more than half of people support some form of abortion, the numbers haven't really changed in nearly forty years. In other words, people aren't really budging on their opinions on abortion, which I think explains why we haven't really made too much progress one way or the other. No mainstream Republican candidates are advocating a total outlaw on abortion.   To be perfectly honest, I don't think that any conservative Republicans are really interested in ""conservatism"" in the sense you specify here.

I don't really have a response to this because you're welcome to your opinion. I see conservatism differently, and I don't see it as incompatible with free trade, for instance. As for the Bush-era wars, a sizable number of Democrats, including then-Senator Clinton OK'd the invasion of Iraq. Was it reckless? In hindsight we can see that it may well have been.

As for immigration, that's another issue that people are clearly divided on; there is no overwhelming majority opinion. As well, opinions in border states are different than those elsewhere.  I agree that public opinion has largely moved in favor of gay marriage in the past years, but it is not treasonous for someone to hold a dissenting opinion.  There is nothing radical about term limits, many political offices at the state level are already term limited.

The reason health care costs are so high is because even though a hospital knows they won't get 100k out of a insurance company, they figure they can get a good percent of that, so they ask a very high price for the insurance to counter offer a lesser price, still higher than it should be.  but now that we have the ACA, it will be near impossible to repeal it and get a real healthcare reform bill through instead of the insurance bill it currently is."

The polls used to report these numbers confined the question to ""For/favor"" or ""Against/Oppose."" Do you really believe that all those people wanting a single payer system are going to vote ""For/favor?"" There is a whole plethora of issues in the ACA that people who support public health care dislike, and would vote ""Against/Oppose"" the law as it's presently written. There are also a lot of people who bought into lies about the ACA. I listened to a woman outside a free clinic talking about how Obamacare was going to euthanize people.  To then try to use these polls to wipe out the ACA entirely, or any public health insurance.  http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-poll/   Polls Show Some Don’t Think ObamaCare Goes Far Enough   When someone says they don’t like ObamaCare we all think they are against healthcare reform, but for many the opposite is true. For instance a while back Micheal Moore helped to spread awareness of the US health care crisis in the US with his movie “Sicko”. The success of this movie helped paved the way for health care reform. However recently Moore called the Affordable Care Act “awful”. See Moore wanted universal healthcare, he didn’t think the act did enough. In this regards we have to remember that some opponents are under-informed (don’t understand ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing, or don’t know what provisions are in the law), some simply wanted the law to lean more to the left, while others thought it went to far. In short, unless the poll specifically asks we have to infer that a portion of those against the law are actually for more healthcare reform not less, be aware of this fact when listening to the talking points.   Let’s take a look at the data from our ObamaCare poll. Please feel free to compare it to the data from any other poll to see if the other guys are reporting what Americans really think about ObamaCare accurately."

This  I was 14 when 9/11 happened, I spent my teen-years learning about the world under the W. Bush administration. The Iraq war is probably the one single spark that lit my interest in politics (I've also religiously watched the Daily Show since the year Jon Stewart began hosting, and the show has evolved in a drastic way since then). Between the wars, the way they were paid for, and the resulting 2008 economic meltdown that affected the entire world: I'll probably have a life-long distrust of the GOP --- I'm simply a realist.  I'm certainly not in love with the democratic party. I'm not totally closed-minded to the idea of voting GOP, and I one day hope the GOP will become a party that fields candidates I can consider voting for, but it doesn't seem like that's going to be happening anytime soon  All that said, I honestly don't think Jeb Bush would be a terrible president. But I have flashbacks to his brother & the people that were brought into the whitehouse along with him. I think about how many current GOP candidates & the last 2 GOP presidential nominees openly talk/talked about war with Iran....which, in terms of foreign policy, is 1 giant chess-move towards WW3  First, I think people are underestimating the buzz Hilary is going to generate simply by being the first woman with a legit shot at becoming president. I think her not being a fresh new face like Obama in 08 will be heavily offset by the fact that she'll be following the first president who wasn't the same race & gender of every other US president.   Second, I really feel like what we've been experiencing with Hilary since her announcement is the fruit of a 7 year smear campaign from the right-wing. I have a hard time blaming her for going into defensive mode early in her campaign when all of the multiple GOP candidates are talking about her on a daily basis & literally anything and everything she says will be twisted out of context --- But I think when she actually begins to talk more about her views & future-policy plans she'll garner significantly more support from the left than she currently has"

A balanced budget means you aren't creating any new debt in a year in spite of whatever the circumstances might be.  If it was to be put into place congress would have to raise taxes, or cut the budget in some pretty drastic ways.  This doesn't effect state budgets really (well it would considering how much states rely on federal funds but you get what I mean)  Many state constitutions have a balanced budget ammendment in them."

PoliticalDiscussion,3e0hlh,nightcrawlerkitten,3,Tue Jul 21 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"In the conventional formulation a balanced budget amendment only applies to the federal government. Budget deficits wouldn't be allowed. The reason that would be a big problem is it would effectively outlaw Keynesian economic policy and it make it extremely difficult to engage other kinds of emergency spending situations (i.e., a world war).   In 2008-09 Bush, Obama, congress passed stimulus packages to prevent a depression. After-the-fact analyses are generally in agreement that the stimuluses helped prop up a tanking economy. A third of Obama's stimulus was just tax cuts.  If there was a balanced budget amendment not only would this be out of the question, but the government would have to drastically cut spending and raise taxes, precisely when millions of people are losing their jobs/homes/need unemployment/healthcare, etc. In a recession that's terrible policy and could cause a depression."

Eliminate the violence, and less people will be willing to uproot their entire life to move to the US   Bullshit, most immigrants will not be significantly touched by the drug violence until they actually reach the border and have to deal with the cartels. They live in a third world nation with all the negatives associated with that, this is why they leave, drugs dont help, but there will be corruption and organized crime anyway.   Legal Immigrants: Eliminate sibling & parent visa. Restrict to Spouses & Children. End chain migration. Instead, a system that awards points based on the following: Level of education, absence of criminal record, experience, and time lived in US, will be used to award visas.   Thats nice, but totally unimportant if you dont effectively secure the border, they will keep coming until the border is secure or the nation rejects illegals at every turn."

PoliticalDiscussion,3e12e9,mathurin1911,3,Tue Jul 21 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"Illegal immigration is a very simple problem to fix.  First of all, we've been doing this backwards. You cannot stop illegal immigration through interdiction because for every immigrant we send back another is just waiting to take his place. Even if we built a giant wall with machine guns and mines we couldn't stop illegal immigration, because they could easily sail around the wall in fishing boats and drop them off further up the coast.   So, we have to ask ourselves why do illegal immigrants come to the United States? To get jobs. So how do you stop them from coming here? Eliminate those jobs. How do you eliminate those jobs? You need to focus on the employers, not the employee. We need to clamp down strongly on anyone who employs illegals. We need to establish tools like employee verification to make it easier to identify the people who employ illegals. Mostly, though, we have to use the power of economics to make it not worthwhile. The fine for anyone caught employing illegals has to be high enough that it negates the economic advantage of cheating the system. If an employer saves $10k by hiring an illegal, then the fine for getting caught should be at least triple or quadruple that amount. If you make the penalties high enough then the employers will not risk hiring illegals. Without jobs, the illegals will stop coming. It's really just that simple.  Of course, this solution would be considered ""anti-business"", so good luck getting this common sense approach passed by Congress."

Of course, ""the employers"" are also often the biggest donors to political campaigns.  That's why this obvious common-sense approach has never been passed.  I'm a Canadian, but I lived in Ventura County CA for a few years, and our Congresscritter was Elton Gallegly (R-Batshit).  He would rant and rave and go on and on about illegal immigrants and how horrible it all was and just whine and lament about the problem.  Then he'd turn around and accept these nice big fat donation cheques from all the strawberry farmers and citrus farmers and avocado farmers in his district, all of whom were, of course, THE biggest employers of illegal immigrants in the area.  While I might have quibbles with the odd detail of OP's proposition, the core is sensible.  A ""points-based"" immigration system is what Canada switched to a few decades ago to get away from our previous ""whites preferred"" system, and while it wouldn't be perfect, it would be an improvement over lotteries and so on.  And yes, for all the illegal immigrants (except those convicted of violent crime; don't deport someone who only has some simple pot possession record, or a citation for wearing their pants too low, or BS like that), give them the option of legal work status with the later option of permanent residency.  The current BS about ""illegal immigrants"", whether it comes from low-level idiots like Gallegly or high-level idiots like Trump, is just so much hypocrisy. It helps galvanise ignorant voters on the side of The Owners, while The Owners most benefit from illegal immigration behind everyone's back.  Hell, how many illegal immigrants are holding housekeeping and custodial jobs in Trump's many hotels?  Thousands?  Tens of thousands?   Without jobs, the illegals will stop coming.

Of course if we did this, I would make it so that districts could cross state lines (which is controversial in its own right) but all districts would be in geographically in the same area in as regular a shape as possible that does not divide communities up (I.E, not have a district cut through the middle of Houston for example) to try to keep the districts as local as possible.    As for the two house system.  I'm keeping it because the house and senate have different powers and merging it into one would be messy and require at least one, if not two more amendments and I only have one to work with.

To keep the # of parties voted in down to a reasonable level (5-7 parties) that is why you make districts 3-4 candidates voted in.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dyo8u,sillyhatday,8,Tue Jul 21 02:20:12 2015 UTC,PR is a worse idea compared to IRV. I've posted this before but here are some of the key things:   It simply doesn’t work for electing Senators and for the Presidency because there is only one winner and so there is no point using it. PR doesn’t allow third parties to run in these elections and anyone who votes third Party is still wasting their votes. This means 2/3 of Federal Government would still in effect be a 2 party system and thus it would do little for reform. Also even if you chose the House by PR the reality is that it would be PR within each state and for many states with just 1 to 3 Seats this would just be silly. With 1 seat it would be no different result from FPTP. In states with 2 seats you would be guaranteed one Republican and one Democrat even if the vast majority say (72%) in say Idaho voted Republican which is just plain unfair.  Direct election allows you to choose politicians who not only represent your area and your views but can also be directly removed when you no longer approve of them. Under PR one Party would put Candidate A at the top of their list and as soon as they easily filled the first quota say 100k votes that Rep. would be elected even if the actual voters who supported his party hated him. This would mean only a handful of politicians right at the bottom of the lists around the 50% mark would actually change at each election. This would only further the whole career politician and in my opinion would probably result in a lot of in-party corruption. Landslide elections where one party wins say 56% of the vote show that people clearly want those policies and those ideas as a clear majority of people in the majority of districts approve. Under PR a landslide election of 56% could still be easily stifled by the political rules of Washington and would not reflect that the vast majority of the country wanted change and the minority would still have significant influence – particularly if the Senate operated by PR nationally. There would forever be gridlock. Also the reality would be that most elections would probably be 50-50 and be fairly pointless a lot of the time. So basically elections are not meant to be proportional. 50-50 should elect about 50-50 for the reps. But the more one party wins in vote share the exponentially more seats they should win (which is how it currently is and this is good).  Votes are also still wasted under PR. If you say need to get 10% of votes or 1000 out of 10000 voters to win a seat and your party gets 5400 then you win 5 seats but 400 of your votes were wasted. Furthermore the other party with 4600 would also win 5. Thus both parties despite a massive difference in votes (especially if you multiply this out by the scale of the real electorate) would get the same number of seats and some votes would be worth more than others.    IRV solves the problem with regards to minor parties lacking the ability to run a serious campaign because of the rules while keeping everything that's good about a majority based system.
PoliticalDiscussion,3dyo8u,co_radio,5,Tue Jul 21 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"It simply doesn’t work for electing Senators and for the Presidency because there is only one winner and so there is no point using it. PR doesn’t allow third parties to run in these elections and anyone who votes third Party is still wasting their votes. This means 2/3 of Federal Government would still in effect be a 2 party system and thus it would do little for reform. Also even if you chose the House by PR the reality is that it would be PR within each state and for many states with just 1 to 3 Seats this would just be silly. With 1 seat it would be no different result from FPTP. In states with 2 seats you would be guaranteed one Republican and one Democrat even if the vast majority say (72%) in say Idaho voted Republican which is just plain unfair.     OK, obviously PR doesn't work (by definition) for single position elections like executives, nobody who has any clue has ever claimed otherwise. IRV is probably the superior option in such instances because it is more efficient than a runoff system while still reflecting majority preference.  Also without changing the composition of the  Senate (which would require two amendments) and the house there wouldn't be much of a point not having a majoritarian Senate and House.     Direct election allows you to choose politicians who not only represent your area and your views but can also be directly removed when you no longer approve of them. Under PR one Party would put Candidate A at the top of their list and as soon as they easily filled the first quota say 100k votes that Rep. would be elected even if the actual voters who supported his party hated him. This would mean only a handful of politicians right at the bottom of the lists around the 50% mark would actually change at each election. This would only further the whole career politician and in my opinion would probably result in a lot of in-party corruption.    There is some evidence of List PR having corruption problems, notably within South Africa's ANC, but there are a few problems with your assumptions here. For one closed list PR which you just described is only one type of PR system, (where in fact in some systems you can remove an unpopular individual from a seat whenever the party wishes because it is the party, not the individual who has won the seat) other systems such as open list PR where your party vote is also a vote for an individual candidate and the list is created by ranking party candidates by the number of individual votes they receive.  My preference is actually for mixed member PR where individual geographically defined seats are determined by votes in each district, after which non geographically defined seats are filled (from a list or by best loser) in order to create a body that is overall proportionally representative of national preference but also has representatives that are beholden to geographical area. (See Germany)    Landslide elections where one party wins say 56% of the vote show that people clearly want those policies and those ideas as a clear majority of people in the majority of districts approve. Under PR a landslide election of 56% could still be easily stifled by the political rules of Washington and would not reflect that the vast majority of the country wanted change and the minority would still have significant influence – particularly if the Senate operated by PR nationally. There would forever be gridlock. Also the reality would be that most elections would probably be 50-50 and be fairly pointless a lot of the time. So basically elections are not meant to be proportional. 50-50 should elect about 50-50 for the reps. But the more one party wins in vote share the exponentially more seats they should win (which is how it currently is and this is good).     I don't know if I actually followed you here but you are assuming that a two party system would persist under PR. Typically parties fragment under a PR system. (this is seen as a feature of PR) because there is no electoral pressure keeping major parties together they will often split over specific or general ideological divisions. (Republicans hypothetically, might split into tea party, establishment hawks, and socially progressive libertarian. Whereas Democrats could split into a progressive wing, a stronger environmental party, and a center left party. Furthermore those on the center-left and center right might actually coalesce into a centrist party.). None of the parties would ever win a majority, instead post-election governing coalitions form where ideologically close parties compromise on a specific governing platform.    Votes are also still wasted under PR. If you say need to get 10% of votes or 1000 out of 10000 voters to win a seat and your party gets 5400 then you win 5 seats but 400 of your votes were wasted. Furthermore the other party with 4600 would also win 5. Thus both parties despite a massive difference in votes (especially if you multiply this out by the scale of the real electorate) would get the same number of seats and some votes would be worth more than others.     Yes some votes are wasted under PR but the resultant representation still more accurately reflects to preferences of the electorate. Winners in majoritarian systems can theoretically claim 100% of seats with 51% of the vote. (This doesn't generally happen in practice but you still encounter serious representational problems as a result)  Furthermore you have your math wrong, the share of votes 'wasted' fall when the contest scales, particularly because you generally have more parties and therefore a more reasonable split and you will always have more seats open.    IRV solves the problem with regards to minor parties lacking the ability to run a serious campaign because of the rules while keeping everything that's good about a majority based system.   This is true if you prefer a majoritarian system to a PR system for any of the valid reasons that exist."

Divide the population by electoral votes, and the result is that Wyoming has one elector for every 177,556 people and Texas has one elector for every 715,499 people.

While I like the idea of a separation of powers, I dislike the idea of wasted votes (which is why I favor the PR system). Tipping the balance toward having a PM, for me, is the fact that no modern rich democracy has yet had a problem of a legislature/PM becoming so powerful that democracy itself became threatened (e.g., by becoming an oligarchy/dictatorship), which is why the powers were separated in the first place. I'd definitely agree with staggered 18 year SCOTUS terms (maybe 15 yr, but w/e), but I don't think that's necessary for Circuit judges.

So a Congressional majority could instead place the question on the general election ballot and if 66% vote yes, the veto would be overridden.  Similarly if a popular constitutional amendment were to be passed in Congress, but has no chance of being ratified by the majority of state legislatures because it concerns an issue of national importance that they oppose for parochial reasons, the people could directly ratify the amendment with a 75% vote.    Or say a popular amendment is opposed by Congress, but is broadly popular, the people could with a 66% vote, directly propose the amendment to the state legislatures for ratification.

The clear enumeration of a topic and the limiting powers on the government that the constitution assigns.   Lawyers are crazy good at finding ambiguity where the average person would believe none exists.   Shocking how many people find this trait to be less than admirable, isn't it.   It seems laws could end up in a constant cycle of being drafted, passed and sent back for a rewrite by the SCOTUS.   Good. They should be. Especially when the law has nothing to do with any part of the constitution. The entire point of the constitution is to limit the government. The constitution is very clear that any rights not enumerated are retained by the states and the people. It's also very clear and very supportive in the concept that the government should be enumerating new amendments to the constitution. Guess when the last time was that happened... When the scotus decides that there is never a need to say ""these rights not enumerated and are retained by the states and the people"" they are quite literally not only legislating from the bench - but they are actually making amendments from the bench... not at all the way the constitution describes the method.  The result is that we haven't had an amendment since the 27th... which was about lawmaker's pay in the early 90s. Before that it was the 26th about the right to vote at 18 - in 1971!... the 25th was about the pecking order of command - in 1967... and finally the 24th in 1962  - The civil rights amendment which is the first of the amendments I have listed that I fell is of actual importance (maybe with the exception of the 18 year old right to vote).  I feel that the 9th amendment - called an ""enigma"" in this link, which in my opinion is hysterical and further proof that politicians and legal ""minds"" are creating this  dirge against the concept of amending the constitution and in favor of ""interpreting"" the existing document however they see fit- and the 10th amendment, which I've never heard used in a judicial decision that states ""This right is reserved to the people as stated in the 10th amendment"", have you? - and of course Article 5, the specific directions on how to amend the constitution are all the parts of the constitution that lead me to believe that the people who wrote the constitution intended for more amendments to be created.   There's also the question of what it means to be clearly defined by the constitution, I know some people who think the second amendment clearly states that there are no limits on private ownership of arms and some who say it clearly states that weapons should only be allowed in the arms of well regulated militias.   This is a legitimate ""Interpretation"" moment. Look, there is no doubt that guns are mentioned here - right? The question is not ""Can we read this to mean abortion or healthcare?"" the question is ""How do we define the exact words used (Keep and Bear Arms, regulated Militia, etc.).  Where does the constitution explain the government has a right to force you to buy healthcare? Where is abortion a right? Where are computer or cell phone searches referenced? Where does it say a corporations giving money is free speech?  In the end- my point seems to me to be clearly justified. Why doesn't it happen? Because both sides of the isle have decided to play the ""Lets try to stack the court"" game. They find it easier to do that than actually try to amend the constitution.  And I find those who preach it to be a ""Living and breathing document"" are the least likely to acknowledge or even mention the fact that the thing that is supposed to make it ""living and breathing"" is the ability to amend it.

Their voice simply does not matter unless they can raise enough money or organize into a large enough group. But what money does, it can casue one person to have as much political power as a group of million citizens, something that is fundamentally undemocratic. When 0.1% of the population is able to contribute over $1 Billion to campaigns that skews the enitre landscape of the election and gives those who contribute the most preferential treatment. I guess you are more concerned with elections remaining free, whereas I am more concerned with the ramifications of the skewing power money has in politics. I think our democracy is only true and free if citizens have an equal voice, allowing unlimited campaign contributions opens the door for only a few voices to be taken seriously by those who determine public policy. It is as much about money winning the elections as it it those with the money (who therefore will be willing to spend it on the next election) are the ones who help direct the actual policy.  I do not think Bernie is the best example for your point, he may actually be a good example of the power money has in politics if he loses to Clinton, which I think will eventually happen. We will have to wait and see on that though.  If campaign spending had no effect on getting elected, politicians would not be so keen on catering to the interests of those who are willing to spend the most. What I am more concerned about, however, is not necesarily the role money has in elections, but rather the role money has on politicians who are elected and those who spend the most get preferential treatment from politicians and their voice is much more powerful in government than the average citizen.  If you have the time this is a great debate to listen to which is between what seems to be both of the points that we are both debating. http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=327753580&m=327768601"

You have yet to demonstrate preferential treatment. The expenditure of money on political speech has never been shown to be corrupting or disrupting of outcomes. If it were true, we'd have President Romney right now.   I think our democracy is only true and free if citizens have an equal voice   I think equal speech is the most dangerous of goals. It empowers the government with truly horrendous powers, and is IMHO fundamentally incompatable with a free society.   If campaign spending had no effect on getting elected, politicians would not be so keen on catering to the interests of those who are willing to spend the most.   You've got the causation backwards: They don't win elections because they have the most money. They win elections because they possess qualities that people like, and those same qualities are those that allow them to fundraise more.  It's as if you open your umbrella when it rains. An outside observer, with no other knowledge of it, might conclude that umbrellas may make the rain, thus banning them would eliminate rain storms and would seem perfectly reasonable.   I do not think Bernie is the best example for your point, he may actually be a good example of the power money has in politics if he loses to Clinton.   Money is useful, but you'll find that a politicians charisma and ideas are far more powerful. Bernie probably won't win the nomination, but it won't be because of the money. What he will do is win a larger share of the popular vote than his share of fundraising dollars. When Bernie loses the nomination, it'll be because the party thinks Hillary will win the Presidency in the general, while Bernie won't."

Here are a few others:  Minimum wage adjusted for inflation peaked in the late 60s  Top marginal tax rate peaked in the 40s and remained consistently high through into the 60s, where it plummeted  The result is that, while everyone's tax rates have gone down over the years, tax rates for the wealthiest among us have dropped dramatically.  So right now, we tax our wealthy less, and ensure our poorest earn less, than we did back in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. The results of such policies are, of course, obvious:  Income inequality, at relatively low levels from the mid-40s through the 60s, is now even higher than it was right before the Great Depression  It doesn't help that Union participation has plummeted, no doubt assisted by ""right to work"" laws. It was the Taft-Hartley Act that allowed states to start enacting these sorts of laws. That act was passed in 1947. A look at the graph confirms it is just a few years after this that union memberships began to decline.  So just because spending is higher doesn't mean we're more left-leaning."

PoliticalDiscussion,3dzw2f,CaspianX2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"It's not a straightforward thing, and there are varying degrees and nuances. Generally speaking, though, liberal or left-wing policies:   Focus more of the tax burden on the wealthy than on the middle-class or poor, both in general and in regards to how policies affect individual taxpayers. Empower the poor with stronger workplace protections, higher minimum wage, greater benefits, and more effective means of upward mobilization. Protect consumers with regulations that ensure that corporations are less likely to be able to exploit or victimize them. Encourage union participation, and prevent corporations from interfering with workers' right to organize. Establish a social safety net for those who fall on hard times, focused on keeping intact the lives of those affected, and making it easier for those effected to transition back into a stable work environment.   Those are off the top of my head, but there may be more I'm not thinking of just at this moment.  As for how we've done? Well:   The wealthy do collectively pay more taxes now... but only because they earn such a massively disproportionately greater share of the income. Individually, their tax rates have dropped dramatically. Everyone else's tax rates have also fallen, but only very, very slightly, not even remotely proportional to how they have dropped for the wealthy. Workplace protections are certainly better now than they used to be, but in many respects they have not kept up with the new ways that employers have exploited employees, such as assigning them erratic schedules that make it difficult to search for a better job. Benefits have improved, though not without a great deal of kicking and screaming from employers. However, minimum wage has stagnated, and is effectively much lower than it was in the 60s. In many respects, market regulation has improved... but again, it has lagged when it comes to new threats. For example, deregulation of the energy market in California led to the crisis of 2000 and 2001, and a lack of regulation has led to an abundance of products in supermarkets that make unverified health claims. As indicated earlier, ""right to work"" laws have gradually killed union participation in America. As your post indicated, we've done okay when it comes to establishing a social safety net... at least compared to our past. But we've lagged behind almost every first-world country in this regard.   All told, it is a mixed bag, but there are some huge, glaring areas where we have lost ground in the last 50 years or so. It is these areas that liberals complain about when they point to how America has become more conservative."

That's definitely de-regulation.  It also isn't even close to all that was done with the California ""deregulation"" bill.  Electric utilities, for example, were not allowed to charge whatever they wanted, there were price controls.  Specifically, utilities could buy and sell electrical power to eachother at market rates, but they could not charge the end users (homes, businesses, you and me) at market rates.  By May 2000, the government-set, artificially-low price controlled rate for electricity was lower than the market-set, honest-but-high price of electricity on the wholesale market...   ...meaning your shitty regulations distorted the market, forced electrical utilities to buy electricity at a loss.

Does this scenario describe ""deregulation?""   Yes, because you just gave the widget makers the ability to sell widgets produced in the state outside of the state, where before, they did not have that option.  Also, your little story assumes that the price of making the widgets was rising due to natural market forces. This is where your story departs from what actually happened in California, where Enron was intentionally withholding supply to drive up market demand, even though the state's energy-generating capability was well above its energy needs at the time.   Give me a Democrat that doesn't make it a point to attack private enterprise, and I'd gladly vote for him or her.   I fail to see how private enterprise doesn't have dirty hands here. Enron lobbied for AB 1890, and then manipulated the market to its own benefit.  I'm not entirely unsympathetic to private enterprises in this case, either - PG&E got royally screwed by Enron's market manipulations.   Give me a Democrat that doesn't make it a point to attack private enterprise, and I'd gladly vote for him or her.   It's not a binary thing. It's not a matter of ""are you for capitalism or against it?"". Capitalism is a tool we use to help make our nation great, but it is not the only tool, and if used in excess, it can be problematic. I don't see it as a great sin to want to rein in those excesses. I also don't think that seeing capitalism as being overall good, while seeing specific abuses of it as bad, are two incompatible views.  As such, I cannot fault a politician for saying that sometimes, an unfettered free market is wrong. But I will always fault a politician who claims that an unfettered free market is never wrong.   Unfortunately, that party has wedded itself to the ideology that people acting in their self-interest is inherently evil   You don't know too many Democrats, I suspect. People acting in their self-interest isn't inherently evil, but it is predictable, and it is not always desirable, and we should seek to change it where it no longer serves the collective good of the people.   so I doubt that I'll see a pro-market Democrat before I die.

At the end of the 1960s, the national minimum wage was $1.60 per hour (nearly $11.00 in today's money). At that time, gas was $0.35 per gallon, meaning that one hour of work could get you over 4 gallons of gas. Today's national average price of gas is $2.75 per gallon, which on today's minimum wage of $7.25 would get you less than three gallons. If you wanted to buy a new car to put that gas into in the late 60s, you'd have to save up quite a lot on minimum wage - roughly 1760 hours for the average cost of $2,822.00. Well, today's average new car price is $33,560, which on current minimum wage would require 4628 hours of work.

And it even starts by arguing against the statistics at hand... but then, this is The Heritage Foundation, which is frequently biased, so their interpretation of statistics doesn't exactly move me.   Wages also aren't the only way people are compensated, benefits and bonuses have been growing as a way of compensating employees.    Okay, what specific benefits were you thinking of, and how much do they equate to in terms of dollar per hour? And a reminder, we're talking about minimum wage workers, here.   Also, why do I have to assume that it's the private sector's fault that these numbers don't look any better?   I never said it was. I said it's at least in part because minimum wage has not kept up with inflation.   government spending as a percentage of GDP has increased    Yes, I conceded that. Were you not paying attention?   the number of regulations keeps going up and up and up (source, source, source)   And how many of those regulations are significant? How many are responding to new business practices, new industries, new problems? How many of those new regulations supplant old ones?  Simply stating the number of regulations really doesn't say much.   and the cost of regulation has exploded at faster than the rate of inflation (source).   So has the size of our population, which means that more regulation needs to get done, involving the work of more people. But that's okay, because that increased population size has also made for increased tax income, which has in turn made for an increased Federal budget. But since this regulation only accounts for less than two percent of that budget, I'm not exactly panicking about those costs."

Who else should we compare ourselves to? Saudi Arabia? Singapore? We have nothing in common with them.   Of all of these countries, the US has the most after-transfer inequality, with a GINI of .378.

This does in fact inevitably lead to all wealth being owned by fewer and fewer people, approaching an asymptote at one individual.   That is not true.  There are many studies that show that increases in economic freedom yield decreases in income inequality (source, source, source), and frankly, the common leftist trope that ""deregulation has led to income inequality in the United States"" isn't even supported by any data.  Regulations have increased every single year (source, source, source), government spending as a percentage of GDP has increased every year (source).  As international trade barriers have fallen (much to the chagrin of social democrats who favor protectionist policies), global income inequality has declined (source).   Social democrats, who are center- (i.e., class collaborationists) left, support countering accumulation with redistribution. The result of this is a greater position in society for labor.   In sociology textbooks.  In the real world, everywhere that this has been aggressively implemented has resulted in far lower living standards for far greater percentages of the population, less wealth, worse health outcomes, scarcity of basic goods, etc.  Everywhere that this has been modestly or lightly implemented has been enjoying slow decline, with government debt buying less and less artificial growth each year, and central banks have exhausted their tools with 0% interest rates and flagrant money printing."

In any case, whether or not people are ""choosing"" not to be successful capitalists, most people have no capital income, and even among the capitalists, most accumulation goes to fewer and fewer people. You might think that's just because the elite are so much better at it and most people are too stupid to save and invest properly, but as long as that's the case you do in effect have a preference for inequality.    That is not true. There are many studies that show that increases in economic freedom yield decreases in income inequality    Similar to another guy in this thread who was telling me about how ""intervention"" is leftist no matter what, here you are claiming ""economic freedom"", whatever that means, as the opposite of redistribution. Now, I have no clue what a bizarre term like that could mean, I certainly would not call my economic views ""anti-freedom"", but taking a glance at the list (created by the Heritage Foundation, naturally), it says that Denmark is one of the most ""free"" countries, far more than the US. This is perplexing, as Denmark has one of the  largest redistribution schemes in the world, and consequently the lowest inequality, as well as being overall prosperous in every way. So whatever mysterious metric is being labeled ""economic freedom"", clearly it is not what I am arguing against.   Likewise, you give me ""number of pages of regulations"" as evidence. Am I supposed to take that seriously? You think I just want to write as many ""regulations"" (which could easily be pro-capital, anti-labor) as I can? Same as spending. I don't care how much money goes through DC, I care how much money goes in to the pockets of the poor. Its just comical really.    In the real world, everywhere that this has been aggressively implemented has resulted in far lower living standards for far greater percentages of the population, less wealth, worse health outcomes, scarcity of basic goods, etc.   Oh really?

I think FDR would have very mixed feelings. One one hand he'd be glad to see the strong foundation he left behind had mostly stood the test of time, and that the U.S. was a world leader in so many ways. On the other I think he'd been dismayed by the divisions the '60s sewed into society and politics, and the retarding effect that has had on progressivism. FDR died at a time when America was more united that if had been at any time since the founding, after a period of great transformation shepherded by great leaders, foremost of all himself.

Misses the point of the protests, but the protests kind of miss the point of O'Malley's broader statement anyway.  This is why in-person protest is kind of useless in this day and age.  What did they gain except being portrayed negatively and alienating people who would otherwise be right in line with their cause?  No one on the Democratic side is going to fall on the wrong side of the social justice equation in 2016, it's not going to happen.

The kinds of people who do activism at the neighborhood level are very unlikely to consider the possibility that said hashtag could have been interpreted to mean that black lives matter more. They're also very concerned with the local response and not very interested in/clued into how things can be spun at the national level. And frankly, they're very likely to view any kind of national visibility as a success, full stop.   Also, the role of the police is a nightmare combination in that it's a.) a highly emotional issue b.) varies widely from place to place and and c.) has very complicated structural and institutional dimensions. As somebody who's followed police brutality campaigns for a while before the issue blew up, it's very weird to have had all these academics talking about how complex the issue is and rooted in socioeconomics and policy shifts, and then see it get completely flattened into a set of one-dimensional accusations of racism."

Sanders is getting a decent amount of attention right now and for once the left-left has someone speaking for them on a national stage that's being taken somewhat seriously. By doing what they did, and maybe because his polling numbers among black voters were already depressing, BLM has ensured that Sanders will acknowledge their issues more when he speaks to large crowds.   Their campaigns may not be well thought out and make people mad, but they're managing to elbow the predominantly white economic issue activists to the side a bit and are forcing them to share their microphone."

As /u/Velvetrose-2 rightly pointed out, the issue of black on black crime, which is largely (but not entirely) an issue of using violence to defend business interests that the state currently classes as illegal, meaning that these people can't use contracts or courts to define and defend those interests and therefore must resort to violence is a totally and completely separate issue from the issue of the State routinely using excessive and deadly force against the black community, especially when the situation does not warrant it.  By constantly responding to the black community's concerns about the latter issue by saying, ""well you guys are always killing each other in the streets,""  you're effectively changing the subject from what the State can do to police more effectively within those communities to a conversation that has nothing to do with the State at all.

And by doing so, you effectively silence all conversation related to police reform.   Except that:  1) The state has also largely caused the problem by criminalizing victimless activity.  2) The heavier police presence and heavy-handed tactics are a response to violent, brutal black-on-black crime.  When it's called ""silencing"" and ""a distraction"" or ""changing the subject,"" it ignores plausible solutions in favor of simply blaming law enforcement, and it's not going to be a winning discussion for the communities you need to bring over to your side, especially when the sort of lawlessness that you don't want to talk about is often believed to be contained only because of police presence.  I don't agree with that point of view, for the record, but I also don't   need to be convinced about problems with police.  But my relatives?  My friends, my co-workers, my neighbors?  They're not even at step one yet, and talking about police brutality while invoking the names of people like Michael Brown isn't going to get them there."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dzzw2,Honest_Discussion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"1) The state has also largely caused the problem by criminalizing victimless activity.   On this we have no disagreement - but I don't think family/friends/co-workers etc., who aren't on step 1 yet have reached our lofty plateau of enlightenment yet, since this connection is quite a few steps ahead (and is also a related, but distinct issue from the issue of how police interact with black people, which gets to your point 2...)   2) The heavier police presence and heavy-handed tactics are a response to violent, brutal black-on-black crime.   You have a chicken-egg dilemma when determining causation here.  But even assuming your view that police presence is a response to black on black crime - BLM's whole point is to examine whether this response is reasonable and rational in relation to the threats posed.  That's the inquiry here.  If you or others critical of BLM want to make the argument that ""police are so heavy handed and sometimes kill unarmed people in response to black on black violence in their communities"" then that's an argument you're free to make, but that really doesn't suggest any solutions either, you're just shifting the blame from law enforcement to the communities themselves.  The party with the greater institutional power bears the greater responsibility here, and that's the state.   it's not going to be a winning discussion for the communities you need to bring over to your side   So then what's the winning formula? What would get them to understand the legitimate concerns of the black community?   They're not even at step one yet, and talking about police brutality while invoking the names of people like Michael Brown isn't going to get them there.   These ideas take lots of time to sink into the popular consciousness. So you have to think generationally - if your family/friends etc are the types to not be at step 1 in this conversation, its reasonable to believe their parents/grandparents weren't at step 1 in the civil rights/school integration/interracial marriage conversations when those were going on either.  So, while these people might not ""get it,"" future generations likely will."

Saying ""it's the police's fault"" doesn't change what's happening, and blaming the police as an institution for black-on-black crime isn't really a credible claim.   The party with the greater institutional power bears the greater responsibility here, and that's the state.   The ""greater institutional power"" bears responsibility for their actions.  It does not remove the responsibilities of anyone else unless a credible argument for ""the police are causing black people to kill each other"" exists.

It is a fact that a significantly higher number of innocent black lives are tragically cut short at the hands of fellow black citizens everyday than those dead at the hands of police. Do you who know the best and most well equipped members of society to stop these senseless and painfully early deaths? It's the police with no close 2nd. Now the police can be only so effective without cooperation and assistance from the community. Media attention, hashtags, and protests may feel good when a member of the community dies under suspicious circumstances with the police. But that is nothing compared to the staggering numbers that die in the streets. Many of which could have been avoided if not for the mistrust of the police. Warranted or not, the community not trusting or working with police is far more dangerous than the police themselves. Therefore it is imperative that we encourage people to trust the police and highlight the good that they do."

PoliticalDiscussion,3dzic1,houinator,8,Mon Jul 20 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the premise of the OP. Unions have been demonized quite successfully by a tremendously wealthy minority that has convinced Americans to put themselves in the shoes of the manager or the owner of a small firm instead of in their own actual shoes as employees of ever larger firms.  In addition the enforcement of the law and the effectiveness of that enforcement has greatly diminished thanks to a dysfunctional NLRB and federal and state departments of labor that have gutted their enforcement divisions on and off according to the ideological leanings of Presidents and Governors. Bush gutted the enforcement division at DoL. Obama restored it but it took most of his term. The former Republican governors of VA,  basically eliminated the agency that enforces the law saying you have to pay your workers and that still hasn't been fixed.  Wage theft in the US is several times larger than all robberies combined these days.   Public employee unions have been blamed for a lot of issues in government and in particular the pensions, but it has actually been state legislators and governors that have been derelict in their duties.  It is not the police union that keeps bad cops in Baltimore from being fired or properly investigated for criminal misconduct. It is an absurd Policeman's Bill of Rights law that the state legislature passed years ago in their attempt to look tough on crime and pose for pictures with a corp of civil servants that most Americans view positively.  It is also not the teacher's unions that have prevented schools from modernizing but rather a crony capitalist process that has pushed all the funding for ""reform"" to textbook and testing vendors and unqualified private/charter school companies.  Similarly on the pension issue, who funded their share of the pension according to the law: The civil employees. Who didn't make their contributions even though they wrote the rules: The politicians. NJ under Christie passed a pension reform bill and then broke their deal a year later and went to court to fight the same law they had championed. Their success in court made a mockery of the notion that states ought to honor their debts.   Lastly, we have a union/corporate relations system that is very much antiquated. Basically unions are the enemy of the managers and shareholders by law. We should consider replacing the NLRA with a German style cooperative system where labor is represented with corporate leadership as part of the price of having a large corporate entity."

They are a corporation, several of them most likely. If these poor schmucks they are pimping out for door-to-door sales don't get enough ""points"", they literally leave them behind in whatever city they happen to have driven them to.

If you just want to protect yourself and milk the cash cow, it's great.  If you care about making the place better and doing a good job, it's terrible.     Wage theft in the US is several times larger than all robberies combined these days.   How do you define wage theft?     It is an absurd Policeman's Bill of Rights law that the state legislature passed years ago in their attempt to look tough on crime and pose for pictures with a corp of civil servants that most Americans view positively.

Wage theft can be conducted through various means such as: failure to pay overtime, minimum wage violations, employee misclassification, illegal deductions in pay, working off the clock, or not being paid at all.   I think Wikipedia has that down.    Guess who plays a major role in supporting and passing that law? The union.

You just took the most charitable reading for your partisan position and just assumed it to be true.  But what I do know is that there was wide-spread drought, probably made worse by climate change, that created region-wide food shortages. That is a fact. Food shortages have been the spark of revolutions through-out history. The self-immolation in Tunisia started in a food market as a complain of scarcity and costs of food. Syria lost 40% of its arable land in a few years preceding their revolution. Egypt was having a water and a food crisis.   In November 2010, just a few months before the revolt, the Mubarak government announced severe restrictions in the production of staple crops such as rice. The reduced rice production had spiralling effects. Prices rose sharply, a key nutritional staple was removed from the poor and, because rice is also a key export crop, agricultural labourers were left jobless. All this was done via the usual autocratic decree from Cairo (The Citizen, Dar es Salaam, November 24, 2010.)  The resulting crisis has produced skyrocketing prices for potable water – soft drink is now cheaper than water in many parts of Egypt – and reductions in the planting of necessary crops (BBC Worldwide Monitoring, May 30, 2010).   Between 2008 and 2011 there were 40 major food riots. These preceded most of the Arab Spring revolutions.  Or you can believe ""Goerge Bush good freedomater herp derp inspired the world derpy derp"".  One of these makes sense and has data behind it."

In 2003/2004 not 2011. How did that go? Horribly. Mass death and Iraq became a failed state.   No one is saying the Iraqi people saw us as liberators.  Or, for that matter, the people of Iran or Syria or Egypt.  What they did see was an opportunity to be liberated.  That these super-powerful dictators were, in fact, human and could be overthrown.  And they took advantage to limited success.    There's a reason this all happened post-2003, when it was demonstrated that these dictators could be toppled and democracy was possible, and not before.  By the way, Iraq is a failed state today because we gave up on them when they needed us.  That's on us as well, but we didn't have to take that route.  We chose that route, and for purely domestically political motivations.   Now if I recall Arab Spring was much more of an native movement. Some guy couldn't get a job, the government food and fuel subsides that the regimes used to pacify the citizens were cut back due to recession and was sick of it all the corruption, he lit himself on fire in a square and it went viral.   No, a man setting himself on fire did not start the Arab Spring.  Riots and demonstrations were happening in the years prior to the Tunisian Revolution, and a tipping point was eventually reached.

This angered Bin Laden because:   the presence of foreign troops in the ""land of the two mosques"" (Mecca and Medina) profaned sacred soil.   After the Gulf War, Al-Qaeda moved it's home base to Sudan and begun terrorist training and operations. In Afghanistan the Taliban was forming during this time because of a power vacuum and lawlessness.   In 1993 the World Trade Center bombing was the first attack on US soil by Al-Qaeda.   Then in 1996, al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. This is when Al-Qaeda declared war on the US.   Then came September 11, 2001.   Then 2003 we invaded Iraq.   As you can clearly see, the US had little to no role in the formation of Al-Qaeda. They are driven by religious goals, much how ISIS is driven by religion.   So your statement that there would be no ISIS if the US didn't invade Iraq is blatantly false and makes no sense."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dx1j8,SapCPark,2,Mon Jul 20 11:48:06 2015 UTC,"I know how Al-qaeda started, Al-qaeda in Iraq was a completely another group.  It was originally called Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad and was found in 1999 by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  They didn't a whole lot till we invaded but once we did, they were one of the first insurgent groups to make a name for themselves in 2003 for their attacks against the US forces and pledged allegiance to Osama Bin Laden in 2004, renaming themselves Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn or better known as Al-qaeda in Iraq.  We don't invade, that group doesn't do the attacks it does, it never pledges allegiance to Osama Bin Laden, it never gets the former military officers that were part of the Iraqi army we took apart after the invasion, and ISIS never forms.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant#Foundation.2C_2003.E2.80.9306"

Also the religious goal of starting a caliphate is still there and that had nothing to do with The Iraq invasion.  Maybe the organization of ISIS would be different if we don't invade, but it would certainly exist today. The Arab spring would have given it the opportunity that the invasion gave it anyway.   BTW we are debating hypothetical situations where we can't prove our opinions one way or the other. So both of our opinions are valid so please stop with the downvotes.  I also think that this is a loaded question; did the U.S. create ISIS? It's disingenuous and ignores their religious motivations. Basically more anti-west sentiment.  When in reality the majority of blame falls on ISIS members and other more nuanced factors that don't make for a lively and controversial debate."

Anyway Hussein's Iraq without an invasion would still have to deal with Western no fly zones and gulf war era sanctions.In the 1990s the USA would occasionally bomb military and intelligence facilities in Iraq I still feel like they would do so in the 2000s .Protests would probably happen for the same reason as with most of the other Arab countries unemployment and corruption. Hussein would have moved quickly to suppress these  protests but just like in Syria it would evolve into a sectarian civil war.   While Hussein has suppressed a revolts before I don't think he could have stopped this. His military was greatly weakened and we all saw what the effects of a no fly zone did to Gaddafi.Rebels having  already have air superiority from the start is a great disadvantage to Hussein. He was very rogue at this point and his only hope for international support would be the Gulf States who he angered while the gulf states did prefer Hussein to an Iranian influenced state they would probably prefer alternative groups in Iraq.   Though if Hussein is overthrown I think you would get a Libyan like situation where a interim Iraqi government fails to project power mixed with Syrian style sectarianism."

Hussein's military was already severely crippled by the no fly zone, and I'm sure there would have been some small intervention on the US side similar to Libya (if necessary). Unlike Libya, though, Iraq has a more educated population and diverse economy that I feel would have been able to establish a more competent democracy. I could also see more separation between regions, certainly for instance an independent Kurdish nation.

Coupled with the unique qualities of living in a globalized world with unique ways to connect and share information in ways that make it difficult for a state to control, and you have a lovely recipe for allowing empowerment. The Arab Spring was a very different situation than what happened in the 80s/90s.  There's no doubt that Hussein would have gone the Assad route rather than the Mubarak route, and tactically I don't know how this would have played out. Maybe his military would have been weak enough and scared enough that it would have largely abdicated and militia's would have routed the remaining forces. If that didn't happen fairly quickly, though, I could easily see multiple actors becoming involved very quickly and forcefully (as opposed to no substantial involvement as we see/saw in Syria)."

Like all president's he made some good choices and some really bad ones.  Since I'm a republican, I'll leave the task of listing his accomplishments to someone else.  In no particular order:  ACA:  Like everything, this was a trade off.  The benefit is millions of uninsurable Americans got insured.  The downside is that employers responded (predictably so) by chopping FT jobs into multiple PT ones.  This screws millennials looking to get into a career.  It also forced young healthy people to subsidize older, wealthier, sicker people.  Drove up costs, drove doctors out of practice, etc.  I lost my high deductible insurance, and now I'm subsidizing others to the tune of thousands of $ a year.   The question is, was it worth it on balance?  I'd say no, but if you're one of the ones that benefited, you'd say yes.    GM bailout:  Again a trade off.  The upside is that big contributors to the Democrats got their pensions saved.  The downside is that we subverted the rule of law and ignored the GM bondholders that legally had senior rights.    I'd call this a failure.  It sets a terrible precedent.    Cash for clunkers:  This doesn't pass the sniff test.  Destroying productive assets and then gov't borrowing money to subsidize replacing them is bad, bad policy.  Its the equivalent of paying people to dig holes and fill them in.  Except more destructive to the economy.  Failure.  Foreign policy:  The ""reset button"" with russia was a failure, as it was destined to be.  Russia decided to invade a few countries, shoot down an airliner, and relations got much worse.    His middle east policy is a disaster.  We're far, far less safe than we used to be.  ISIS is festering boil that must be lanced.  Its a damn shame that tens of thousands of people who would have been our allies were instead beheaded and raped to death.  The next president is gong to have to put boots on the ground, and the death toll will be worse than had we just stuck around.  The president had no good options, but he picked the worst one.    Race relations:  I had pretty high hopes for President Obama on this one.  Obviously his promised ""national dialogue on race"" was abandoned the minute his ass hit the chair in the oval office.  The real pisser is that the second black president of America won't have the same opportunity as the first one.  He didn't use the opportunity he had.    Economy overall:  Not good.  Poor growth, many people hiding out on disability.  Obviously the rich are getting richer while the rest of us stagnate.  Not a failure, but not a resounding success either."

That is how insurance works, with or without the ACA.   The problem with ACA is that it mandated certain coverages be included, even though the subscriber would never use those items; ie. Males having to pay for contraceptive, OB-Gyn, and prenatal care coverage.   ACA also mandated certain bands of coverage, so if your plan fell outside those bands of coverage, it was no longer legal to be offered. This is what killed all of the high-deductible, low-cost catastrophic insurance plans, as well as the high-dollar, zero co-pay, 100% coverage plans that many companies offered their upper management."

While he was inclined to see a small number of American soldiers stay behind to continue mentoring Iraqi forces, the likes of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, on whose support Maliki’s ruling coalition depends, were having none of it. Even the Obama Administration’s plan to keep some 3,000 trainers behind failed because the Iraqis were unwilling to grant them the legal immunity from local prosecution that is common to SOF agreements in most countries where U.S. forces are based.  So, while U.S. commanders would have liked to have kept a division or more behind in Iraq to face any contingencies — and, increasingly, Administration figures had begun citing the challenge of Iran, next door — it was Iraqi democracy that put the kibosh on that goal. The Bush Administration had agreed in 2004 to restore Iraqi sovereignty, and in 2005 put the country’s elected government in charge of shaping its destiny. But President Bush hadn’t anticipated that Iraqi democracy would see pro-U.S. parties sidelined and would, instead, consistently return governments closer to Tehran than they are to Washington. Contra expectations, a democratic Iraq has turned out to be at odds with much of U.S. regional strategy — first and foremost its campaign to isolate Iran.

The power-vaccum in Iraq caused a reverberation of insurgency across the middle east & northern Africa. What we now call ISIS began long before Obama was in office, ""ISIS"" is just the branding it received at it's apex.  Your claim that the next president will have to put boots on the ground makes me feel like you don't know much about the reality of ISIS. --- They're an internet meme, they're unsustainable, they're amateur hour, and most importantly: They're losing virtually everywhere they're fighting  The fact that the US hasn't committed substantial military force, besides air raids (for the most part, though theres a substantial number), has caused local forces in the middle east (both civilian & military) to swell in opposition to ISIS. They're fighting too many battles on too many sides, but even at ISIS's peak they losing in the long run. They have no resources, they have no sustainability. They take over a town, and the town falls apart. Donald Trump's favorite anecdote about ISIS opening a luxury hotel is ridiculous: They simply use the hotel for non-local fighters to stay. I'd be surprised if the hotel has electricity or even running water because ISIS can't keep a city running --- ISIS is little more than a well-operated propaganda machine, they're the first terrorists to fully implement the internet in a clever way  All that aside, the Obama administration just sealed a nuclear deal with Iran...which has been the holy grail of foreign/middle-east policy for a very long time. The last administration tried it, gave up early on it, and said the U.S. would never deal with Iran again --- The last two republican presidential nominees (along with several current candidates) openly ran on a platform of going to war with Iran...McCain, a war veteran, even joked about it  Foreign policy is about far more than using military strength"

He chose to abandon ship, and I can kind of understand why at least on a superficial view. His voting base, and much of the country has been convinced being in Iraq was bad.  He was appealing to much of the country by taking this action. Also Iraq no longer wanted us there, as there leader was requesting that we leave. So on top of Obama complying with the US citizens, he was also listening to Iraq.   If he didn't abandon Iraq I think the response would still be negative. The right would be slamming him for not keeping promises, as would the left. I don't think you would be any happier with his choice if he stayed.

Fast and Furious was started under Obama well into his first year in office.  Operation Wide Receiver was under Bush and was ended because it was ineffective.  The big difference between the two is that Wide Receiver was a gun-tracing program where the ATF in coordination with Mexican officials attempted to electronically track guns sold to traffickers while Fast and Furious was a gun-walking program with no method of tracking the weapons and included no involvement of the Mexican authorities nor even the Mexican branch of the ATF."

That being said, my strongest criticism is the state of the national debt.  When Obama took office, the debt was around 9.5 trillion.  Today, the debt is 18.1 trillion dollars.  I was critical of Bush raising the debt, and Obama took it to the next level.  (18.1 trillion - 9.5 trillion)/330 million) is around $26000 per person for this presidency, so far (including children, prisoners, etc).  So, a family of four now owes around $100,000 in debt ABOVE AND BEYOND the taxes they already pay.  The Republican candidate for president should simply say ""Do you feel like you got your $100,000 worth?""  I know the recession was a big part of it (although I highly doubt the 900 billion stimilus project really helped), but still, we are in big trouble.  The population is getting older, and no on is dealing with entitlements.  Medicare is paying doctors pennies on the dollar even with the ""doc fix"" and social security is now ""losing money"" (although all of its money is borrowed) and disability insurance will be broke before the year is up.  The states' public pension funds are in worse shape.  We will likely NEVER HAVE A SURPLUS AGAIN.  Fed short term interest rates are ZERO, and we have no tools to deal with a future recession (which the business cycle suggests will occur in the next 3-10 years).   We are screwed.  Also, Obamacare is a failure and a poor ploy to socialize healthcare in this country, but others have mentioned that.  Also there is ISIS but I think we are facing perpetual war in the Middle East and that isn't entirely Obama's fault.   By the way, historians will point out that Gay Marriage was legalized under Obama, but he didn't do anything to make that happen and OPPOSED it until recently.    P.S.

Federal spending on interest as a percent of GDP has been steady for a while (it ballooned a bit in the 80s but came back down during the 90s).

Unlike Clinton (who worked with Newt) or even Reagan (who worked with Tip), who recognized that they only way to actually get effective legislation accomplished was to work with the opposition, Obama has instead dug in around his ideology. Republicans share the blame, but the President is the LEADER and he effectively chose to go his own way rather submit to the idea that half the country didn't vote for him, and he lost his congress after just two years. He doubled down on himself and lost half of the country in doing so. Had the american people been totally blown away by his role in effective governance the first two years, that might have turned out different.  My personally observations are -   Race relations are far worse now than at any point in my lifetime  The average american is lacking disposable income, meaning many industries are suffering and the economy is not humming along as we should expect  Our foreign policy has not left me with a farm fuzzy, and I don't think the US looks very strong in the eyes of the world. We are as much hated by the very people Obama sought to appease as ever, and have gained nothing for his efforts (except some nice Cuban cigars).  It is not up to the president to make laws (even though this has done so), it is his job to lead, and I feel that he has failed miserably as our country seems more divided than ever.

Lord Janner is even accused of raping a boy in Westminster itself. Oh, and the Royal family too, with Prince Andrew linked to American Epstein and accused of underage solicitation. Victims have also claimed abuse in the royal houshold by staff.  So far, the only ones the government have admitted to are the dead ones - Brittan, Cyril Smith (both MPs), Hayman (ex head of MI5), and TV presenter Jimmy Saville. It all started unravelling with the death of Jimmy Saville, who had been knighted, and was a close friend of Thatcher and the Royal Family, and who had managed to get keys for numerous hospitals and childrens detention centres in decades of abuse.  Many retired police have come forward to say that investigations were halted from above. Dossiers have gone missing, people have been killed in mysterious circumstances (including Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando, whom it was recently revealed took concerns to her bosses at the BBC), Ben Fellows is being prosecuted for naming Kenneth Clarke MP as his abuser, another victim is being harassed by Nottingham Police..), and a senior, sitting Labour MP has just been reported to police by a fellow MP for raping a 12yo boy, amongst other offenses, and is now under investigation.  It's all very sordid. Janner was excused from prosecution due to dementia, despite voting in the House of Lords some 200 times since the diagnosis, though luckily that decision was reversed and there will be a 'trial of facts'.

We are going to have to try to increase the ratio of skilled vs. unskilled workers in the country through education and job training programs, but it's still a long ways off before we start feeling the need to, so there's going to be an uncomfortable valley where the problem starts cropping up but isn't fully acknowledged."

I think the mistake a lot of people make on this issue is the assumption people are these intellegent, intuitive beings that are irreplaceable in a market setting.  Although this may be true for many industries low skilled labor and clerical jobs could easily be replaced by AI.    This is already happening to a certain extent.

Prices for generators go up.  Regulators put price controls in place to try to keep the cost down for the sake of availability and affordability to consumers; but this removes a large incentive for producers from surrounding markets to move in and meet the high demand; so results in less availability, and even higher black market prices.

Automation will eventually target skilled labor as well, and perhaps it already is -- analysts, paralegals, customer support specialists, and someday even computer programmers and therapists.   Yes, and it will make a dent, but not a particularly big one.

Well, that's just like saying that factory work depends on things like decision-making and cooperation. You're putting an arbitrary yardstick on what automation can do. Fifty years ago it would have been considered impossible for a machine to do observational quality control.

No it's not, because that's an incorrect statement. That would be factory management work, not factory labor.    You're putting an arbitrary yardstick on what automation can do.   The yardstick is flexible vs. inflexible, both in terms of physical capabilities and processing ability.    Ten years ago it would have been considered impossible for a computer to drive a car, which requires observation and decision-making   This would certainly have been considered possible decades ago, we just didn't have the miniaturization of technology ready yet.

No, I'm pretty sure unskilled labor has steadily declined as a portion of the overall economy over time.   Yes, because education has increased and the economy has diversified. That would have happened regardless of the number of available low-skill jobs. If you're saying that automation will continue to shift that margin at the same pace as it has been shifting, then we've got no problem to speak of. But what I assumed the general concern here was is that automation is going to pull out the rug rather quickly on a lot of jobs. I think this is true for low-skill jobs, not for most high-skill jobs.

Of course, the period of time for which that was true was maybe 30 years at best. The number of people going to college increased, not decreased, as low-skilled labor paid more and more from ~1945-1975. The two are largely un-correlated.   People weren't going to college in droves in 1900 because we didn't have either the system of education to support it, nor did we have enough white-collar jobs available. Keep in mind that the population also boomed throughout the 20th century, so while the % of people going to higher education and high-skilled jobs increased, the raw numbers of people doing low-skilled labor also increased for a good period of time, until only recently when globalization started closing factories."

I account for this the same way I already explained in my previous post: by simply looking at history and observing that even during the very brief period of time in which a manufacturing job could get you a decent living, an increasing number of people were going to college. The availability of good-paying manufacturing jobs did not slow the growth of even-better-paying white collar jobs.   Furthermore, as I said, the devaluation of manufacturing jobs has little to do with automation as much as it does with globalization and the availability of cheap manufacturing labor overseas. If automation was the reason then low-skilled jobs today would be harder to come by. They aren't. They just don't pay anywhere near as well as they used to."

Having now watched his video my main complaint would be I felt he did not adequately tackle professional careers, and I'd want a better explanation for 'white collar.' Certainly I can see a number of his White Collar jobs being automated by code sure, and I'm not sure all can be.   I'm still a grad student so I don't have to join the scary real world yet, but I have trouble seeing client relations being handled by a robot. Creative maybe, but the danger with having a robot that does only what it knows will work is that you won't get new. Not bad when you want to just do the same, but when you want a new sales pitch for the client you can't just do 'This works, therefore it is best here.'   As to professional, the lawyer example to me seemed very weak. As he noted the primary automation he's talking about is already used. And we still have and need a lot of lawyers. Parsing through records for discovery while important isn't the end of the lawyers job it's the beginning. He did not go and explain to me how to automate the next step you've got to have the computer take what you learned in discovery, deal with the client, take precedent, case law, statutes, and practice and apply it. Can we automate that? He didn't go into that that I recall.   As for Doctor's where he did go more in detail. How expensive are these? Who has liability? Taking his insurance argument from transportation when Doctor-bot gets it wrong (as he notes it will) who do I get to sue? I know little of the medical field, but malpractice insurance is big IIRC so I imagine that is a very important question first.  Once economic growth becomes entirely unhinged from labor of any kind you could lay off the 45% of the workforce he's talking about and still provide goods and services to the remaining and what would be the negative effect on the remainder?   Returning to White Collar jobs he generally left me underwhelmed. Can a robot design a new destroyer? The impression he sorta gave me is that robots would be extremely evolutionary in their design. So they would perfect everything we have now. But I don't recall him really making an argument about robots revolutionizing things."

The problem of course is that while Rubio and Jeb need to strike balance between Hispanics and the GOP base with comments like ""We will both streamline immigration and toughen security"", any Dem candidate has no concern and can safely say ""If elected I will guarantee citizenship for all immigrants, no ifs ands or buts"".

It was wasn't it. I was taking a small segment of a large group and treating that group as if that small group is representative of the whole.  Not to discount your own personal experiences, but it's entirely possible that you happen to interact with a particularly conservative group of Hispanics who aren't, at least where acceptance of homosexuality is concerned, representative of the entire Hispanic population. If you read the whole article I linked to, the author of the survey broke down some of the contributing factors. Among them was the what their respective pastors taught. Hispanics with harshly anti-gay pastors were three times as likely to consider homosexuality an abomination as ones with more accepting pastors. Maybe Hispanics tend to take religious teachings to heart, and your area happens to have a few anti-gay pastors, therefore the Hispanics around you tend to be more anti-gay than the Hispanic population as a whole.   I would also say that ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" might play a role. There's a lot of overlap of xenophobia and homophobia on the right. Say you're baselessly blaming me for a lot of problems and blaming another guy for a lot of other problems. Knowing that I'm not causing what you say I am,  I'm going to be more open to the other guy not being as bad as to say he is, even if I didn't particularly like him to begin with.  There's also the possibility of confirmation bias. You believe Hispanics are strongly anti-gay, so you notice the times that support your belief. The evidence presented seems to contradict your own personal experience. I don't mean to invalidate your experience, but it just seems impossible to apply it to all Hispanics. Migrant Mexican farm workers who crossed illegally and live in California are not third generation descendants of Cuban refugees living in Miami, who aren't black Dominican immigrants living in New York, who aren't ""Mexican-Americans"" whose family has lived in what is now Texas since Spain controlled the territory.  There are a number of explanations for why studies are showing that Hispanics' attitudes toward gays are more accepting than you believe, and there's no reason to think they won't continue to move to the left on this issue.

Although it is certainly conceivable that he will win enough of the Hispanic vote in enough swing states to win the overall election.   In the long-run political parties care about winning and they will recalibrate as needed to appeal to enough of the electorate to win. Democrats tend to do better with the Hispanic vote right now but the parties will change as will the policy preferences of different demographics. A competitive electoral system will always work itself back towards an equilibrium over time.

PoliticalDiscussion,3duz8d,White_WesleySnipes,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, they embraced the Southern Strategy instead. Alienating black voters by playing off racial resentments in order to run up the margins with non-Hispanic whites. Strategically it was workable because black voters make up a relatively small portion of the electorate so they could lose black voters by massive margins so long as they juiced their numbers with non-Hispanic whites. However, with the growth of the Hispanic demographic, the GOP cannot rely as heavily on white identity politics and racial resentment to win. Romney won non-Hispanic whites by 20%, which would have been a blow-out win 30 or so years ago but Obama still won because of growth in the non-white vote as a portion of the electorate. Unless they can find a way to wring more votes out of a shrinking non-Hispanic white demographic, Republicans will have to improve their standing with non-white voters to be viable in certain elections.   At the same time there will be an interesting dynamic because many GOP house members, senators, governors, etc. represent places that still are so overwhelmingly non-Hispanic white that they can still use old tactics to win but at the national level and in many other places, it is going to become a necessity to reach out to other demographics to win. A third thing too is that there are some places like AL or MS where there is a large non-white/black bloc of voters but partisan voting is incredibly polarized along racial lines so non-Hispanic whites will vote Republican by the same margins that black voters will vote Democratic."

PoliticalDiscussion,3duz8d,VegaThePunisher,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"The Hispanic/Latino vote is one of the more frustrating issues that continues to plague the GOP. Looking at the Hispanic/Latino population as a whole, their values very closely align with that of the Republican Party - most are strong Catholics who hold fairly conservative social values (Pro-Life/Pro-Traditional Marriage), place a strong emphasis on the idea of ""family"", and in general, the Republican ideology of hard work and ""making it on your own"" leading to success, speaks to a lot of immigrants. However, a large portion of the Hispanic/Latino population in the US (primarily in the Southwest) has been here for generations - they didn't cross the border, the border crossed them - and that the anti-immigration and racist ideologies can sometimes get kind of blurred. In fact, in 2000, Republican George W. Bush won the majority of the Hispanic/Latino vote - so things can shift fairly quickly.  The breakdown comes when you have the more vocal, and frankly racist, members of the GOP saying things like what Donald Trump or Iowa Congressman Steve King says or the ""color test"" laws in Arizona, and thus having the entire GOP painted as such. I personally believe that the Republican Party missed an opportunity to gain at least a toe-hold with the Hispanic/Latino population, if the rest of the GOP Presidential field would have stood up as one and denounced Trump's remarks, they could have shown and rolled out an entire Hispanic/Latino outreach initiative.  It's also important to remember that the people who vote in Primaries (Presidential and otherwise), tend to be; older, white, male and conservative. So until the current generation of Primary Republican voters essentially die off, courting the Hispanic/Latino vote will be an uphill battle, even if that demographic and the GOP share common views. It won't happen in 2016, and probably not until the middle of the 2020s when Texas and Arizona become Democrat battleground states instead of the Republican strongholds they are now, and truly force the Republicans to re-examine their positions."

I agree with you. The Republicans missed the chance to forcefully condemn Trump's remarks and unequivocally state that that's not what the party is about. Rupert Murdoch saw this and came out pretty hard via Twitter, but the candidates didn't.  To be honest, though, the GOP voters themselves are part of the turnoff. When almost a fifth of likely republican voters say they'd vote for Trump even after his comments, I wonder if any right-of-center Hispanics would reconsider whether they'd want to associate with the party at all. There is a strong, unambiguously racist and xenophobic segment of the GOP, and it exerts disproportionate influence."

They won't give you a reason they just think democrat is the right way to vote because other Latinos are doing too and because democrats are inherently good and republicans are evil and racist.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dule7,KumarLittleJeans,7,Sun Jul 19 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Edmond Burke is considered the founder of the modern school of Conservatism. To learn more about what Classical Conservatism stands for and what it stands upon you should read something written by him or about his philosophy.  Alexander Hamilton was one of America's Founding fathers and the biggest proponent of Conservative ideals around the time of our Nation's birth and the drafting of the Constitution. Same thing here, read something written by him or about him to better understand how Conservatism shaped our Country from the time of its founding.   Since both of these guys died over 200 years ago and you're in HS I don't imagine you're up to reading Enlightenment era philosophical discourse so I'd recommend finding a book that explains their philosophies and includes a little bit of their biography. I encourage you to learn about Classical Conservatism, who both of these men represent, because it is the basis upon which the modern conservative parties base their ideology and have played a strong part in the formation of the American system of government."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dule7,Fofolito,15,Sun Jul 19 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think many American conservatives identify with Hamilton.  He was a Federalist -- a proponent of a strong federal government with an expansive view of federal power under the Constitution.  I think most Republicans today prefer to identify with Hamilton's rival, Jefferson, who was an advocate for a weaker federal government."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dule7,grammanarchy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:30 2015 UTC,Modern American Conservatism has some major divergences from Classical Conservatism. Classical Conservatism has less to do with small government and more to do with the role of government. Burke and Hamilton believed that unrestrained (pure) democracy was undesirable. They believed that people created systems of governments to suit their needs and that tradition plays a part in determining those needs. To best understand the modern equivilant I'd say its best to know the evolution of the species so to speak.

It is an anthology with an argument, locating the origins of modern conservatism within the Enlightenment and distinguishing between conservatism and orthodoxy. Bringing together important specimens of European and American conservative social and political analysis from the mid-eighteenth century through our own day, Conservatism demonstrates that while the particular institutions that conservatives have sought to conserve have varied, there are characteristic features of conservative argument that recur over time and across national borders"

They're allies because well frankly they were one of the few ME states not already allied with someone. Iran was British, the Levant was a mix of French and British, and Egypt well actually I'm not sure what Egypt was doing back then to be honest.   Warning what follows may be biased as it comes mostly from a Jordanian embassy employee (and professor).   In the ME there's 3 major states. Iran which is the biggest, Shia, and Persian. Then you have Egypt which would be the cultural capital. They produce most of the entertainment, this is going back pre-Al jazeera as well, and they're the most populous Arab state as well as pretty advanced politically. Finally we have SA which has the most oil, and the center of religion.   So during the Cold War Egypt after nearly getting invaded by the French, Brits, and Israelis doesn't take a liking to America. The US already has SA as an ally and wants another so we pick Iran. We support the Shah, sell him nice kit, and he helps us out. This begins the Twin Pillars Strategy. Where the US controls Saudi Arabia and Iran. Works pretty well for the US for several decades.   I'm going to contain my eternal loathing for Vance and Carter and suffice it to say when Reagan is sworn in Iran is gone. Now the US still needs oil, and wants an important guardian in the region for our interests. Egypt begins to fill that role, but given Iran is under the control of an Anti-Western government and Egypt has a number of problems there isn't really a reason to throw away SA. They've been helping us to manage affairs for decades by this point.   So we stick with them and then the Cold War ends. The End of History has arrived. And then Saddam invades Kuwait. He then threatens Saudi oil fields and we initiate Operation Desert Shield. Then Storm, and finally Desert Sabre.   Now we have large military basis there and can generally use it as a staging ground for projecting power in the ME when needed.   Geopolitical allies do not need to share your values. They simply need to share geopolitical interests, which SA-US does. Secularism, democracy, free-market. These things are not necessary. As a side note checking with Heritage (yes I know they are biased however they have a very nifty tool) says they aren't that un-free economically and are pretty similar to Turkey, a NATO ally.   US-SA interests align pretty well starting with we both want the free flow of oil. While we may not import that much from them they do export quite a bit and are an important voice in OPEC. So they can help keep oil prices lower even if various other states benefit more directly. Two we don't like Iran. Saudis, or Arabs in general, hate Persians/Iranians. They have a wonderful naming dispute over what to call the piece of water they share, have religions that committed some pretty bad atrocities against each other, and when Iraq invaded Iran the Arab world paid him money to continue fighting.   Further nuclear proliferation is a much more serious issue then oil. No one in the region wants an Iran bomb. While Israel got most of the headlines, Obama ruffled quite a few feathers amongst our Arab allies in negotiating with Iran here, because they like Israel are afraid Iran will evade sanctions, get a bomb, and then nuke them. I don't know if it was speculation or not a threat, but I think SA in particular was looking at obtaining Pakistani nuclear weapons.   Now as you note Iran does sell us a fair bit of oil and can effect us and global prices. Well having them as an ally is beneficial there. It won't change anytime soon, so getting them on the right side is good policy. Hell look at the most recent oil price change. It happens to serve both of our interests amazingly well. It hurt the Russian economy, and Iranian economy for us, while making Shale less of a thing for them.   We have Greeks and Turks in a defensive alliance. Politics makes for strange bedfellows. SA doesn't like Israel, but in comparison to most Arab states they seem pretty lax in their attempts to purge the infidels. They sent a couple hundred troops in the '48 war and basically they just commit money when needed (which if they didn't would probably get them in a lot of trouble).   In terms of Democratizing I know a bit less on the Saudi side, but if we take a step next door to Kuwait. Having been friends for awhile the US talked incessantly about human rights, democracy, women's rights. In meetings it was always there and annoyed/shamed the Kuwaitis enough that they hated disappointing Bush (and hearing him talk about it) so the Emir bought the votes in Parliament and passed a law giving women the right to vote.*   http://www.heritage.org/index/visualize?countries=saudiarabia|turkey&src=country  *Kuwait sections are also going from my recollection of a talk by US Ambassador Labaron (Ambassador to Kuwait from 2004-2007)."

It could be zero and they could (and actually do) still help us by helping regulate the world price of oil.  At the request of the U.S. the Saudi royal family has kept oil prices low by over-pumping their fields, which lowers the overall value they're going to get out of their oil over time and screwing their own people.  In return the House of Saud gets propped up by the U.S., defendeD against the threat of Islamic coup.  It's really just about that simple."

I really think it's insulting and is just as bad as saying that African Americans only voted for Obama because he's black.  Those things may partially motivate somebody who wouldn't already be voting to get out to the polls.

If they're voting for her they most likely agree with her policies somewhat.

If they're voting for her they most likely agree with her policies somewhat.   I was talking about the primary, not what Republican women would do.  You're right that the issue is complex, and plenty of polls showed black voters supporting Hillary over Obama.  But I absolutely believe there are plenty of female democratic voters who might agree more with Bernie's policies that would like to see the first female President and would vote for Hillary because they're tired of old white men running things.  Can I blame them?  Absolutely not.  Obama has been far better for African Americans than probably any President before him, even if his Presidency has stoked the racial hatreds of the south more than any time since the 1960s.  I don't think we'd see the same kind of backlash against Hillary that we saw against Obama because the Republican PR machine wouldn't be able to play on these deep-seated hatreds in red states the same way.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dvdkw,ZenerDiod,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"It does have an effect, however minor. A lot of people will say they are not affected by how politicians look but some studies say otherwise. But being tall and handsome has some correlation to elections.  ""Kids Pick the President"" put on by Nickelodeon has been correct all but one time. The contest started in 1988.    Kids Pick the President has accurately predicted the winner of each election with the sole exception of the 2004 race   Wiki Source  Another study was done in Switzerland using children to predict the winners as well.    This finding contributes to a large and growing body of evidence, coming from many research groups, which shows that voters seem to be heavily influenced by a candidate’s appearance, and in particular the kinds of personality traits that a politician’s face projects.   In particular, politicians with facial features that make them look like they possess strong leadership qualities seem to be at an advantage, at least among some voters. (Appearing like a leader seems to be tied up with perceived competence, and is different from appearing attractive.)    Source This source touches on the subject of heuristics where i first read about this. That is basically that people are lazy (mentally) when it comes to making tough decisions. So they will unknowingly replace a complicated decision with something much more simple, such as a politicians facial features.   Edit: I really think that the second link has a lot of basic information regarding this topic. If you're bored i'd recommend reading it fully."

Whether they'd support increases in middle class taxes in exchange for things like public higher ed or health care, I agree is a challenge.

Most got upset about Iraq spending, but a lot of people take the position of ""spend whatever it takes"" when it comes to ISIS and other terrorist groups.   Plus, much of our military spending isn't on fighting, we spend quite a bit of money on veterans benefits. Cutting those would be even more unpopular.

Not sure Israel has the reach for a traditional strike there. All that said, Gaddaffi was orienting towards a more pro-western (or at least not explicitly anti-western) foreign policy at the time.

If the Arab spring didn't happen but they seemed on their way to building a nuclear weapon I think it's likely the U.S. would have bombed them.   Good point; that said, though, would the U.S. have known about Libya's nuclear weapons building progress in time? After all, as far as I know, the U.S. was surprised as how much nuclear equipment Libya acquired from the A.Q. Khan network.   All that said, Gaddaffi was orienting towards a more pro-western (or at least not explicitly anti-western) foreign policy at the time.   Yes; thus, let's assume that Gaddafi still accepts responsibility for Lockerbie and agrees to pay financial compensations to the families of the Lockerbie victims but nonetheless insists on keeping his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program in this scenario.

Well again, it's one of those issues where it would solve itself before it was a problem. If Libya started developing missiles that could reach Europe, a conflict would have flared during that ramp-up process. But if they did have that ability, I still think they would have gone ahead and taken the chance that the command and control chaos caused by the revolution would have made long range retaliation less likely.    would the U.S. have known about Libya's nuclear weapons building progress in time   I think so.

Gaddafi was the OG of state-sponsored terrorism.    the U.S. was surprised as how much nuclear equipment Libya acquired from the A.Q. Khan network.

And yet the U.S. was apparently surprised at how much nuclear equipment Libya had in 2003.   But we did learn it, didn't we.

Then there'll be more serious debates about whether DC should become its own state or merge back with Maryland. If people favor the former, then just DC will need to have a referendum on the issue. If people favor the latter, then both DC and MD will need to have referendums on the issue.

First Ladies are just the wives to the president, they literally hold no actual political power outside of caring for their personal family, that's unless a female becomes president, then it'll probably be first gentleman. The elector has power, the wife does not.  Any other questions that you might think should be discussed about her and the political scene please do add.

I am voting regardless because I rather see the lesser of two evils win then to let the worst politcal party in the white house.    That said I wish we could change the Presidential elections rules/laws to allow run off election so that people could feel conferrable voting third party without fearing that they will help the candidate they like the least win
PoliticalDiscussion,3dufh5,mrhymer,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:08 2015 UTC,Voting is the means by which we peacefully change power. It is an unprecedented advancement of civilization. Not voting is a vote to revert to a less civilized means of transferring power. It is a similar to the Amish choosing not to use electricity or the fundamentalist Muslims refusal to recognize the rights of women. It is a rejection of the progress of civilization. Not voting is an indication that you do not intend to make a peaceful transition of power work. That you are waiting for the previous method of changing power by blood and death.
PoliticalDiscussion,3dufh5,mrhymer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"Voting is the means by which we peacefully change power.   I do not disagree, but voting can only change power.

This is why I feel I cannot vote, because doing so legitimizes the violence and power of the state regardless of who takes the reins."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dufh5,mrhymer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:28 2015 UTC,Just because voting has not reduced and dismantled power there is nothing barring it from doing so. The future of the US hinges on that very question in my opinion. When George Washington left office we were the first power in history where power changed hands without death or blood. If we are not the first power in history to peacefully relinquish power back to the people we will continue to grow the federal government to the point of failure. Your vote is needed.

And from this, that it's fairly clear that the most violence societies, the VAST majority of the time, have been those without governments.  For instance, in the first half of the twentieth century(often thought of as the most dangerous time in human history-colonialism, both world wars, the holocaust, ect) around 3% of people were killed.  He compares this with stateless societies where they averaged about 15% of people being killed.  Another example, is the most peaceful long-lasting anarchist society he could find(one often used as an example by anarchists), and it was about three times more deadly than the most deadly American cities  also the author is a professor at Harvard, and the book was nominated for a nobel prize in non-fiction"

Too bad, nearly no one that wanted democracy votes, the turnout was something like 35%. But we have a massive voter turnout for the monarchists at 80%.

But the problem with spreading the mentality that your vote doesn't matter is that it causes people to vote less. In this sense it has a much greater impact than just one person not voting.

The fact is the more people who know he exists the higher his poling numbers go. Bernie's views are nearly all main stream ideas which are highly popular especially with progressives which are typically left of typical democrat views. These ideas have been toyed around with for years as a way to drive voters to the polls (see 2008 with universal healthcare and 2012 with lgbt rights) but no one until Bernie has been willing to support progressive ideas with their entire platform. You see the support has been there for a while for a progressive socialist democrat but candidates have been unwilling to take the chance in supporting a full progressive platform out of the fear of the unknown. Fortunetly for Bernie supporters Bernie's views have been consistent for the last 20+ years so he doesn't have that fear of the unknown.  Now with Ron Paul his ideas in some cases are not consistant with having mass voter appeal and furthermore some of his ideas don't have any evidence or working examples to prove the ideas are sound. With Bernie's platform he has literally dozens of countries to show proof that his democratic socialist ideas do in fact work.  I think it's very safe to say that Bernie has a hell of a shot while Ron Paul never had a chance.

Ron Paul won most of the straw-polls during the 2012 primaries, but the media, especially Fox News, blacked it out.   You are correct that Ron Paul's straw polling numbers were up there but if you look at the july 2011 statistics he was only polling at 9% and 2%.  The polls in general are quite confusing as the numbers are all over the place.  That said out of 69 polls Ron Paul did win 32 of them. Thats less than half which does not equal ""most"" but that said of those 32 polls quite a few are online polls in whole or in part which does tend to favor non mainstream candidates.  Like Bernie supporters, Ron Paul supporters are just as active online and they love dominating polls when they can.  Regardless I will edit my above comment to reflect the inaccuracy."

Such early release was prohibited by the POW's interpretation of the military Code of Conduct: To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.[34]  In August 1968, a program of severe torture began on McCain.[46] He was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery.[34][46] Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt, stopped by guards.[34] Eventually, McCain made an anti-American propaganda ""confession"".[34] He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, ""I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point.

We can still disagree with McCain on his views and policies but I believe that his time in the military, especially being captured and tortured should be strictly off-limits for political attacks and criticism.

It wasn't hard to appease Obama Haters in 2012 and get people on his side with low level tactics. Now, he has to deal with Hillary, but also other republicans, and it might not work out so well. Heck, I happened to flip over to Fox news this morning, and they were tearing him apart.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dr9qg,pokll,9,Sun Jul 19 18:28:54 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. Your position implies that only if a candidate basically pretends their family doesn't exist should they be protected from the typical campaign vitriol. Bringing your spouse/kids in to actively campaign is one thing but introducing them to the public and acknowledging their existence shouldn't be a green light for anything goes.

It's way too soon for the Trumpmania to subside.  If I were a Republican, I would want to be as Trump-like as possible (I guess I'd need money first, right?) just to screw with everyone.  But what really matters here is identity politics, not actual positions on issues.  Trump has many things, but zero of them involve substance.  Nobody actually supports Trump because they agree with his views, because he doesn't have any views.  His plan to beat ISIS is ""I have a plan but I won't tell you because then the enemy will also know what it is.""  But unlike other utter morons who may run for office (like Michele Bachmann last year), Trump has vagueness and passion on his side.  He's very passionate about being a conservative idiot but without ever saying anything with any substance, just general red meat shit.  Basically, it doesn't matter what he says, so long as he promises that he's a conservative.  He doesn't actually need to be a conservative; he just needs to make the conservatives think that he's one of them.  All the conservative positions mean jack shit when you don't have the conservative identity down.  Now, that said, veteran worship is so 2004.  At that point, we had a war in Iraq that the conservatives liked and the liberals did not.  So, naturally, the conservatives invoked the ""support the troops"" meme, with the notion that the liberals did not support the troops.  Since this is basically the common stereotype anyway, the meme became huge.  In a very rare and very long effort, the left basically flipped over the meme, taking a very visible lead on issues like fixing the VA, healthcare for 9/11 responders (who are not veterans specifically but it's a similar situation), etc.  Even back then, the left supported things like body armor for troops, bringing troops home instead of letting them die, trials for contractors who were sexually assaulted but whose contracts specified arbitration (again, not specifically veterans but it's the same principle), ending DADT, etc.  Hell, Bernie Sanders has won awards for his leadership on veterans' issues.  This is basically the only successful bit of Democratic messaging we've had this millennium.  So veterans' issues are not solely Republican territory like they used to be.  That means that Donald Trump really might be able to get away with mocking POW's.  And I so, so, so hope that he does.  He's completely unelectable, but he can only cause real damage to the Republican brand if he stays in, damn it!"

I'm curious though on what Trump's end goal or real reason is for throwing his hat in the ring. I hear that candidates don't have to pay back any money donated to their campaign so that could be a reason. He gets millions in donations, spends as little as possible (since all he has to do is say something crazy to get coverage, he doesn't have to pay for commercials or actual campaign staff) and gets to keep the rest.   He could also just be a Republican sanctioned distraction.

This particular lie came about after gun control advocates failed in their efforts to use frivolous lawsuits to bypass congress and the people and get gun makers to do what they wanted, which makes it even funnier that ""will of the people"" crosses your mind on this issue.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,mathurin1911,5,Sun Jul 19 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to kind of lump some of your comments into one response so we don't jump around a lot.   The single most important thing, IMO, is to strike down the ban on the CDC researching gun violence. Every decision we make should be guided by good data, and right now if we were to make any gun laws we would be doing so blind.    As stated below, the CDC is not banned from research gun violence.  It is however, unable to use any funds to advocate gun control(a political position).    It is perfectly able to use its funding to research and publish data on gun violence.  The fact that it chooses not to do so because it is barred from pushing a political position should be a huge red flag when it comes to their motivations for research.  I completely agree with you that reducing access to firearms reduces the suicide rate.  However, I do not believe that is a valid reason to infringe upon the rights of ~100 million Americans.     Now on to defensive gun use. Estimates from the 1990's suggest that 1-2.5 million defensive gun use occur per year. This figure is often discredited as the survey was very broad and asked a general question along the lines of ""did you use guns defensively in the last year."" Many researchers assume the survey was riddled with false positives. A more conservative estimate from the government is around 100,000 uses/year.    The kicker is some of the studies claiming that DGU are incredibly low fail to count DGUs that for example, don't result in a death.  It's not like we have a reliable # for this at all, and we probably never will.  In my opinion, it's largely irrelevant though.  Whether or not we ever have a single DGU doesn't matter when we have a right to firearms.  It's a great point for the pro-gun side to use in an attempt to sway some people on the fence, but when it comes down to it, it's not relevant as long as the 2A exists and previous SCOTUS opinions support the right to keep and bear arms(which as early as 1876 was considered separate and not dependent upon the 2A for its existence.   I don't believe they actually represent the gun owners. For example, about 74% of NRA members support universal background checks for gun sales, yet the NRA itself has refused any expansion of background checks whatsoever.   Did you read the study?  You basically agreed with the question, or said you wanted to give every felon unfettered access to guns.  It's not difficult to get strong support for the answer you want when you word the question that way.  As you used a similar issue with question wording to dismiss a DGU study, I use this issue to dismiss this study.  Subsequent polls have found far less support for UBCs among NRA members.    Not to mention, this figure was touted when Congress was voting on the Manchin-Toomey bill.  Even if 100% of people supported the concept of UBCs, it doesn't mean any of them support that specific bill.  The argument I used at the time was that I can probably get almost 100% of people to agree that we should reduce crime in the US, so I'll propose a law banning people from ever interacting with each other, ever.  That'll reduce crime, but I don't get to complain when Congress fails to pass the law that they failed to pass a law that had ""near 100% support from the population"" without being completely misleading.  This is essentially what the issue was with MT imo.  While I disagree with you on the issue, I commend you for being able to discuss it in a civil manner."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,mrbobsthegreat,0,Sun Jul 19 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middlle of studying for a final so I'll make this brief. Thanks for the detailed response.   As stated below, the CDC is not banned from research gun violence. It is however, unable to use any funds to advocate gun control(a political position).   When Ebola was a major problem, the CDC had the right to suggest plans and policies for reducing the risk of infection.  The CDC has always suggested and designed policy that would for example reduce the rate of automobile accidents. The CDC shouldn't be silenced from researching and making suggestions just because people may disagree with the position.    The kicker is some of the studies claiming that DGU are incredibly low fail to count DGUs that for example, don't result in a death.   If we only counted DGU that result in a death the count would be 200-250/year. The studies that I've cited calculate their estimates based on surveys of individuals. Much of the criticism of these studies are because the researchers worded their questions in extremely vague ways. In fact, one of the authors of the study that the 1-2.5 million estimate is from stated:   ""The lack of such detail raises the possibility that the guns were not actually 'used' in any meaningful way. Instead, (respondents) might be remembering occasions on which they merely carried a gun for protection 'just in case' or investigated a suspicious noise in their backyard, only to find nothing.   .   Did you read the study? You basically agreed with the question, or said you wanted to give every felon unfettered access to guns.   In all honesty, this one I did not read this study itself, only the articles summarizing it. I will have to look further into it. (as anecdotal evidence, which in debates like these mean pretty much nothing, I have never met a person actually against universal background checks. Thats just me though.)"

Again, the CDC is not silenced from research; only from advocating Gun Control(a political position). Ebola transmission is not a political position; it's pretty cut and dry.  Gun violence is mixed in with a bunch of other factors. You can probably show that telling people to do XYZ reduces the risk of transmission by X%, but I don't know of any Gun Control policies that can say the same(implementing Gun Control XYZ reduces gun violence by X%).  From a scientific perspective, one is much more concrete than the other.  When you allow them to start making policy suggestions that are largely partisan, it really starts to erode the credibility of the institution.  From what I read on the topic, the CDC was basically told to find a way to support more Gun Control.  That's not exactly a scientific way to approach the issue.  I would not want them doing the same thing if they were told to find a way to oppose Gun Control either.  If I want biased research, there's a slew of groups I can go to.  We don't need a supposedly impartial body to put out biased research as well.  Again, there's nothing wrong with them studying the issue, and releasing the data.

I'm sure the data would show that banning guns would lead to less gun violence... We are entitled to the means to defend our lives and liberty. Period.   Does the data back up your belief? No. Our best look at how a gun ban here would effect our population is to look at Australia and the effect of their ban. Here's a study from Andrew Leigh and Christine Neill about the effect of Australia's buyback. TL;DR from the abstract:   We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise.   Now on to defensive gun use. Estimates from the 1990's suggest that 1-2.5 million defensive gun use occur per year. This figure is often  discredited as the survey was very broad and asked a general question along the lines of ""did you use guns defensively in the last year.""

If the 100,000 uses are correct, that's a death rate of 0.213%. Seems awfully low to me.    The fact is that most homicides are committed by someone whom the victim knows. When guns are less available, these rates go down because the  method  of killing is harder and longer.   To quote comedian Jim Jefferies:   Most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have?   So what right trumps what right. Do Americans have the right to prevent an additional 100,000 crimes at the cost of the potential lives saved by enacting a ban? Because that's the rub.

Here's a study from Andrew Leigh and Christine Neill about the effect of Australia's buyback.   I can't help but notice that the overall suicide rate increases in the years immediately after the 1996 buyback and only gets lower than the 1996 rate about five years later.  There was also a conspicuous overall downward trend in firearm suicide rate in that data starting in about 1991 and continuing mostly unperturbed through 2006.  So yes, it is technically true that the gun buyback happened, and then the firearm suicide rate decreased 80%, but this is another of those misleading half-truths that we were talking about earlier.   Now on to defensive gun use.   I mentioned this elsewhere in this thread.  Also, the original researcher of one of the 1-2.5 million studies responded(pdf) to his critics.  The direct response to Hemenway begins on pdf page 15, but most of the early pages seem to be relevant.  The TL;DR is that the criticisms are both completely speculative and one sided in the sense that they completely ignore the effects of false negatives.  That 108k estimate would also fall prey to the same criticisms, but the effects of false negatives due to its structure are crippling for our purposes here.  This guy  tried to analyze both sides.

The firearm suicide rate immediately jumped up, but then trended downward for the next 10 years as guns became less available.   As for the half truths. If our hypothesis is that suicide rate is independent of firearm availability, we would expect a decline in the rate of suicide by firearm. We would also expect an increase in the rates of non-firearm suicide, as the majority of those without access to a gun would turn to other methods. In Australia, the firearm suicide rate decreased, but the rates of non-firearm suicides did not increase. It actually decreased 27%. It suggests that the gun buyback was not 100% responsible for the decrease in firearm suicide, that there was other factors at play (probably better mental health services). But the study shows that the gun buyback was a major contributor to the total decrease of suicides. Not really a half truth when you look at surrounding data.  I would love to keep this up, but I am studying for a final coming up, so I may stop debating. Thanks for the civil discussion though."

How long do you think the buyback program lasted?  And its not the firearm suicide rate that increased; it's the overall suicide rate.  Page 517 has the data I'm talking about.   It actually decreased 27%.   But not until five to eight years later.  That is quite a substantial lag between cause and effect given that they buyback occurred in one year.  Substantial enough that other societal and economic changes are at least as influential on the rate.  I didn't see a compelling argument for why such a delay exists.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,GravitasFree,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:58 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying now. Honestly I'm not sure why  that would occur. I know in their analysis, they compared states in australia to determine if the rate of buy back would increase affect the rate of decline for suicide.   First, non-firearm suicides and homicides fell substantially on aggregate in Australia in the period 1997–2006. Second, the estimated time pattern of the response of non-firearm deaths (suicides in particular) is not what we would expect to see in the case of method substitution. It is also inconsistent with suggestions, based on time series analysis, that the uptick in non-firearm suicides in the period 1997–2000 could have been a consequence of the buyback. Our results show, by contrast, that that jump occurred primarily in the states where the fewest guns were handed in, and where the gun buyback would have been expected to have the least effect.   Also, I am not suggesting that homicide, suicide, and hospitalizations are a simple subject. I know there is a million variables to consider when trying to improve the rates. What I don't like, is whenever a mass shooting or a high profile crime occurs, I hear a lot of the media saying, ""a gun is an inanimate object! you can't blame the gun! Blame our mental health system, or the prevalence of violence in pop culture. The gun is not the problem!""  I believe our mental health system IS a huge problem, and that there may be too much violence in pop culture. But I also believe that the availability of guns is a huge problem. Maybe not even the biggest problem, but a major problem nonetheless."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,MrPoppersPuffins,11,Sun Jul 19 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"Suicides are indicative of a mental health issue that exists with or without guns.  The idea that less guns somehow solves this problem is absurd.  I would like to see some direct data, since the idea of substiting methods would seem to be likely.    Your linked paper is huge, but it does acknowledge some ambiguities.     Non-firearm suicides, on the other hand, have remained relatively high compared to historical averages, despite declines in the early 2000s. The increase in non-firearm suicides from 1996 to 1998 is noteworthy, since some commentators (for instance, Baker and McPhedran 2007) have pointed to this as possible evidence of substitution from guns to other [methods of suicide].   .   Now on to defensive gun use. Estimates from the 1990's suggest that 1-2.5 million defensive gun use occur per year.

If the 100,000 uses are correct, that's a death rate of 0.213%. Seems awfully low to me.   This leaves out a very important factor.  Knowledge that guns are prevalent is in itself a deterrent.  This study breaks states up into two groups, those with high access to firearms and those with low access.  Here are the findings     The difference in gun ownership across the two sets of states is significant. In the top-24 states, an average of 48 percent of households reported having access to a firearm. In the bottom-24 states, an average of only 28 percent of households reported having access to a firearm. If the premise behind gun control were correct, the data should show markedly higher rates of gun crime among the bottom-24 states than among the top-24 states.   If access to guns meant more violence, we would expect to see higher crime rates in top 24 states.  However, according to the FBI violent crime and property crime are identical across the two sets of states- with one exception, robbery is 40 percent lower in the states with more guns.   http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/michael-bloomberg-shoots-50-million-blanks-on-gun-control/   So what right trumps what right. Do Americans have the right to prevent an additional 100,000 crimes at the cost of the potential lives saved by enacting a ban? Because that's the rub.

I agree with you that knowledge of the possibility of a victim having a gun is a deterrent, I think the current state of US gun laws contributes to this. In US cities today that allow guns, criminals can drive 20 minutes outside the city limits to legaly purchase guns. It's easy for criminals to buy guns.   But when you ban guns on a national level, there is no where to buy them legally. Supply and demand skyrockets the price. In australia a black market handgun costs $15,000.

These are drops of 65% and 59%, respectively, and among a population of 20 million individuals, represent a decline in the number of deaths by firearm suicide of about 300 and in the number of deaths by firearm homicide of about 40 per year. At the same time, the non-firearm suicide rate has fallen by 27% and the non-firearm homicide rate by 59%.  I'm sure more children are hurt each day from riding in a car, should we ban those too?

We've ramped up enforcement of drunk driving and made sure officers don't let them off with just a warning. Guess what happened? Driving related deaths dropped from ~50K in the early 80's to ~30K today! But when people try to take even minor steps in this country such as expanded background checks or magazine limits, shit hits the fan.

Hemenways critiques were apparently not taken seriously, because the Supreme Court cited Klecks work in D.C. vs Heller.   A more conservative estimate from the government is around 100,000 uses/year.  The FBI estimates 213 justified homicides/year.   Source(s)?  There is no standardized way of tracking defensive gun use, some precincts don't record it all, and those that do have varying methods.    The FBI estimates 213 justified homicides/year. If the 100,000 uses are correct, that's a death rate of 0.213%. Seems awfully low to me."

Background checks are already required, including internet sales. The NRA is opposing the additional barriers, such as the extension of wait times. This is ""gotcha journalism"".    less than half of all NRA contributions come from their members.    That article only counts dues as contributions from individuals. Even if it were to only be half, that's still a massive amount of money. You may not agree with the NRA, and that's fine, but lets not pretend they're just a corporate shill."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,Brutally-Honest-,0,Sun Jul 19 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"I got into this debate before and someone posted this article about the Smith and Wesson boycott. Here's my response to the article:  A quick and incomplete analysis of the article   The company also agreed to adopt a ""code of conduct"" that would, among other things, require gun shows that sell Smith & Wesson weapons to conduct complete background checks on every buyer.    Here we have a complete background check, something that would decrease the rate of sales of guns in the US being supported by S&W   17 of 29 state and local governments, including Camden's, have agreed to dismiss their lawsuits against Smith & Wesson,   The incentive for S&W for a slight decrease in sales is to drop court cases, saving them a LOT of money in legal fees.   Paul Jannuzzo, vice president and general counsel for Glock, said... [Glock] ""had to balance the cost of bleeding to death with legal bills against the possibility of a consumer boycott.""   Glock is afraid that the cost of possible loss of business is greater than the incentive of low legal fees   ""I talked to the vast majority of them and the unanimous response was, 'No way,' "" Delfay said.  (on whether the next 10 largest gun manufacturers would follow S&W)   So, like Glock, every other major gun manufacturer didn't want to take this deal in the fear that their sales would ultimately drop as a result of this action.   The company also agreed to terminate contracts with gun dealers or distributors if a ""disproportionate number"" of crimes are traced to the weapons they sell.   This, I think is the most telling part of the article. Essentially, as part of the deal, S&W must cut ties if it is discovered that a shady dealer is providing guns to a high number of criminals. This isn't even a fear of a boycott. This is a fear of losing sales because the guns can't get into the hands of criminals.   Gun manufacturers are, at their most basic, a corporation. They don't exist to provide protection, sport, fun, peace of mind, etc. The exist for one reason, to make a buck. The way they choose to do this is by selling weapons.   What it seems to me ended up happening is the largest of the manufacturers ran the numbers and found that because it was, at least at the time, the largest gun manufacturer, and as such, it had a disproportionally high number of lawsuits. It found that the incentive of reducing these lawsuits was better for the company than the risk of a short term boycott and losing illegal sales (they probably weren't expecting the NRA to come down this hard on them).  The other gun manufacturers believed that the possibility of a boycott and losing illegal sales was much more detrimental than the legal fees it may have to pay. So they denounced the deal with the White house.   Now the NRA has a choice. They could side with one mega-giant gun maker, or 15 normal giant gun makers. It saw more could be gained from supporting the rest of the manufacturers than just S&W.  Conclusion: My claim is that the NRA says that they have the best interests of the average gun owner at heart, when in reality, the gun manufacturers can give WAAAAYYY more money to the cause than the everyday owners can. So the NRA bamboozles the average american into believing it's all about gun rights and the right to self defense and freedom as a way to game the system into bringing in tons of money for the gun makers. It claims to be for the people when in reality its for the companies.   To combat this claim, you cited an article that described a situation in which the NRA decided to attack one gun manufacturer for the benefit of everyone else. The NRA was doing nothing more than protecting the financial interests of the majority of corporations from the possible future fallout that could have come from the business decisions of a single corporation. It bullied a company and almost bankrupted it because the rest thought that down the road their decisions might cost them profits. I think your article actually supported my claim."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,MrPoppersPuffins,10,Sun Jul 19 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know what point you're trying to make with that. It's a blatantly obvious example of the NRA contrasting with gun manufacturers and hurting their profits.

To combat this claim, you cited an article   What article are you referring to? I didn't cite any article.    The NRA was doing nothing more than protecting the financial interests of the majority of corporations   No offense, but that's some serious mental gymnastics. If the NRA was really trying to protect their profits, they wouldn't have done anything and let the new legislation fly under the radar.   The NRA calling to boycott manufacturers for accepting gun control measures in exchange for legal immunity (which saves manufacturers money) = The NRA looking out for manufacturers profits? That makes no sense. Smith & Wesson almost ceased to exist and still hasn't recovered because of this, that's a pretty big blow to the gun manufacturing industry."

Sorry, I just copied and pasted my response to an earlier disscussion about the S&W boycott. I was lazy and didn't tailor my response to our discussion. My apologies.   No offense, but that's some serious mental gymnastics. If the NRA was really trying to protect their profits, they wouldn't have done anything and let the new legislation fly under the radar.   I don't think it is. Essentially, S&W was paying huge legal fees to defend its sales practices. It was a MUCH larger company at the time than any other gun manufacturer. S&W agreed to much tighter sales regulations. In exchange, over half of the lawsuits against S&W would be dropped. They were expecting some consumer boycott over the agreed to tighter regulations, but the  backlash they were expecting would be nothing compared to the legal fees they would save.  At the time, however, the other gun manufacturers were not paying nearly the amount of legal fees S&W were. They determined the cost of a possible boycott would be greater than the cost of their legal battles. This is evidenced by this quote from the vice president of Glock:    ""had to balance the cost of bleeding to death with legal bills against the possibility of a consumer boycott.""   Ultimately, S&W was the only company that made the deal with the Clinton Administration. The NRA had a decision. Support the largest corporation, and the new regulations they agreed to, or support the other companies, and reject the new regulations. The  NRA is ultimately a business, and got more money from the other corporations, so they rejected the new regulations. They were looking out for the majority of the manufacturers at the detriment of one of them."

Support the largest corporation, and the new regulations they agreed to, or support the other companies, and reject the new regulations.    You're missing the point. The main reason why those other companies rejected the new regulations was because they we're afraid of NRA backlash. This is the opposite of the NRA serving the gun industry, this is the NRA and organized gun owners having power over gun manufacturers.    The NRA is ultimately a business, and got more money from the other corporations, so they rejected the new regulations. They were looking out for the majority of the manufacturers at the detriment of one of them.   You're reaching with this. Everything the NRA does somehow comes back to being pro corporation."

If there was say ~30% of people in every state carrying a weapon with them, then criminals would think twice before trying to rob a McDonald's or a Dollar Store. The fact of the matter is that criminals do not follow Gun Regulation laws and could care less if they are breaking them. We should give people a chance to defend themselves.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,Austinpike446,7,Sun Jul 19 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"US gun violence is overwhelmingly tied to very poor urban areas.  Most of it's due to the consistent illegal drug trade, lack of business investment in these areas, widespread cases of broken home lives, and the necessity to join a gang in order to feel protected physically, avoid seeing your family suffer if the gang gets mad at you for not joining, and because of the easily manipulated nature of adolescents.    The #1 gun violence issue isn't even related to guns.  It's the fact we've let the black urban poor areas fall apart after Jim Crow.  It was a pool of gasoline ready to ignite considering how many blacks were already denied a higher education and even basic education, were not able to join the corporate ladder in many cases, were not able to access many forms of credit, were segregated into very poor neighborhoods, and had to deal with very overt hatred.  The lighter was the bust in manufacturing and many low-skill jobs along with the drug trade.  Way too many families could have been preserved if we made certain that we could boost the education numbers and decrease the lack in high-skill job areas caused by discrimination.  We lost a lot of parents to prisons with no way of effectively reentering them into society and it's compounded.  The black community simply was not provided the tools necessary to succeed in the late 20th century due to Jim Crow.    Fact is gun violence will remain high until these ongoing problems are fixed.  We're too late to fix the inadequate response after Jim Crow ended.  So now we have to deal with a high rate of broken families, little business investment and infrastructure, etc.  Lot of these young guys in the hood have to pack some heat or else they'll get killed.

Being caught owning a gun without a license or registration would result in a harsh penalty. Something like 10 years jail. Committing a crime with a firearm automatically doubles the sentence.   That's it. The idea is to allow law abiding citizens to have as many guns as they want while making it more difficult for criminals to get away with committing gun crimes.

This kind of nonsense didn't work with the drug war, what makes you think it would work with guns? You're advocating a decade in prison for a nonviolent offense of simple possession. That's utterly absurd.  If all of a sudden there was a new law that banned anti-American speech after a two-year grace period, do you really think every ""law abiding citizen"" would comply? Of course not. The same is true with gun rights. 10% of gun owners refusing to comply is a wildly conservative estimate. It would probably be higher.

If it takes 30 hours of classroom time for a kid to drive a car, whose purpose it is for transportation, then it should take at least a similar amount for people to own a gun, whose purpose is to shoot people, whether in self defense or otherwise.

Self inflicted accidents are already covered by health insurance. Thus, we are left with a subcategory of accidents where someone accidentally injures another person with a firearm. Assuming liability insurance similar to how car insurance works. This subcategory is all that would feasibly be covered by firearms insurance. It is an undue burden to require insurance for all owners to insure this subcategory of incidents. Car crashes far outpace accidental firearm incidents. In addition, insurance does not prevent the damage from happening, but rather compensates via money for the damage inflicted."

Guns aren't nearly as accident prone, gun accidents killed 505 people in 2013.  That is less than .4% of our total accidental injury deaths in the US.   http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm  Most gun deaths are suicide, and most of the remainder are intentional homicide, and safety training does nothing to reduce either. It seems to be that people who desire a training mandate for ownership, not even just for carry, are trying to put an unneccessary time and money barrier between citizens and their constitutionally protected rights.

Even if the point of the thread was about how to get from here to wherever liberals want gun laws to be it's only a matter of replacing some Supreme Court justices. After all, federal courts recognize an individual right to own firearms only due to recent actions of activist judges.   Again, I wouldn't support effectively denying firearms to poor people.

County courts by themselves average about $12 in just access fees to look at their records, and states average about $15 (again, just access).  Then you have to pay someone to actually go through those records, and that's definitely not a minimum wage job.  A halfway decent criminal background check can run a hundred bucks or more.

I might as well compare New Hampshire, with its lax gun laws and murder rate that's identical to the UK's, to Washington, DC and its extremely strict gun laws and high murder rate, then conclude that looser gun laws = less murder.  Let's look at trends over larger sample sizes.  Across the 50 states of the union: no correlation between gun ownership and murder rate.  Across all the countries of the world, across just Europe, across just Asia, across just South America, there's no correlation between gun ownership and murder rate either.  Of course, this is just very raw data and statistical analysis. Things like poverty rate, employment, etc. aren't controlled for."

Based on that belief, my view is that the best way to move towards less guns in America would be to disarm everyone in public.

PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,DevonWeeks,2,Sun Jul 19 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"Gun terms are very misleading.   Yeah.  They can be a bit nebulous, and the fact that we had legislation that misused some of the terminology in the 90's helped to kind of exacerbate that problem.     Anyway, what I actually meant to say is that I want to ban anything that can fire more than 1 bullet per pull of the trigger.   There's a lot of pro-gun people that support this idea as well.  What a lot of gun control people don't often realize, though, is that those guns are already illegal.  They were made illegal under a bill called FOPA in 1986.  Although, at that time they were referred to as ""machine guns.""  Older guns were grandfathered in like with most legislation, but modern automatic weapons were effectively banned.  There are some exceptions, obviously, such as Class III dealers being able to obtain them (since they are able to sell to law enforcement agencies), but the average civilian can't just call up Heckler and Koch and ask for an MP7 on mail order.  So, you basically already have this.  Where people get confused is when they see that someone bought an ""AK-47"" or an ""M4"" at a gun show.  People see that and think people are buying genuine military weaponry.  But, they aren't.  They are buying semi-automatic weapons that look like military weapons.  The guns are just like you said.  They only shoot one bullet at a time.    Take a look at this listing on gunbroker...  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=495721087  It's an AK, right?  Well, not a ""real"" AK.  Scroll down to where it lists the specs for the gun and you'll find the ""Action"" is semi-automatic.  But, the AWB and other gun control ideas seek to ban that gun despite it being functionally no different than this one...  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=495004475  That's what makes having gun control conversations so hard.  The people who want more gun control often don't know that much about guns, and what they propose often has bizarre effects on the gun industry that don't actually accomplish anything.    The AWB, for example, banned the first gun I linked but not the second.  Why?  No reason other than aesthetics.  The first rifle can fire 7.62 rounds (which are nearly identical to .308) and can shoot them semi-auto.  The second gun does the exact same thing with .308.  Both guns can hold magazines that carry more than 20 rounds in them.  As a matter of fact that second gun is a ""hunting"" rifle by classification, but it's design actually comes from the old Browning Automatic Rifle (which actually was an automatic gun, unlikely either of the first two I linked).  You can see it here.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle  So, it's all a pretty complex issue.  Much of what gun control people want is already is in place.  They just don't realize it.  Some of what they want has very negative effects because it uses terminology that includes vast tracks of firearms that are ubiquitous, like the AWB.  Then you have to combat emotional arguments that have no real merit, like when people want to ban high capacity magazines (despite most gun crimes being committed with guns that hold less than 8 rounds, namely revolvers).  It's a very nuanced debate, but the more we can convince gun control and gun rights people to talk to each other rather than at each other they more progress we can make towards finding a realistic solution to gun problems that still ensure the right of law-abiding citizens to have their 2nd Amendment rights uninfringed."

We live in a country where votes matter, and the last thing you want is to lose votes. If this country ever gets off the gun needle and joins the rest of the civilized world, then maybe guns will get banned and taken, but until that point stop being scared about them taking your guns. If they were going to do it they would have done it already."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,PIE-314,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"is that our background checks are horrible, and fail to catch enough people that shouldn't own guns.   Is this your opinion or do you have an actual source for this?"
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,PubliusPontifex,0,Sun Jul 19 19:58:39 2015 UTC,Dylan roof seems like an appropriate example here.
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,PIE-314,2,Mon Jul 20 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"Sure. But background checks were aplicable here. The fact that it failed is on the state and sucky reporting. Not the law. It wasn't followed. Earlier poster gets what he wants. Background checks. Like most gun control laws in regards to public/mass shootings, they fail. They always will. Gun control laws are like locks. They keep honest people honest. They will never serve a further perpose without infringing on the free American citizens rights. Intent be damned."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,nightstryker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"Most mass murders are committed by someone who bought the gun legally. Having an extensive registry and requiring training will prevent those people to access to guns.   These two statements seem to contradict each other, unless your position is that ""mass murder"" is a type of ""impulse murder.""  Otherwise, a mass murderer can simply plan out his attack (as many do), take the requisite training while doing so, and register his guns (what does he care, he wants to go out in a blaze of glory anyway)."
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,thatsumoguy07,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"The point of the registry, license, and training is to sift out those people who get through the cracks of our very broken background check system. Look no matter what we do there is no way to predict someone snapping and turning from everyday Joe to mass murderer. But that's the point of everyone having to go through the license and training. More people will be more confident in carrying guns and there will be less accident/heat of the moment crime, while at the same time there will be people there trained to use a gun correctly who can possible end the situation a lot quicker. Right now in most states you carry a gun without even knowing what the correct size bullet to use, and that's the biggest reason people don't like open carry, and don't want it. We can't know what the other person knows. But if we register, license, and train, we all will know what everyone else knows, and we can be more confident to carry a weapon. We are also more confident in our abilities, and enough people can easily detain someone before they kill multiple people."

How does that even work?  If you want stricter background checks for ownership, I can understand that argument, but how does someone having a list of guns and gun owners (who have already passed whatever checks are in place) stop someone from improperly getting through the checks?   Right now in most states you carry a gun without even knowing what the correct size bullet to use, and that's the biggest reason people don't like open carry, and don't want it.   Bwaaa?  Most states are ""shall-issue"" carry states with set training curricula, so you've already got that.  Open carry doesn't enter into the discussion, unless you're talking about ""permitless"" open carry which is definitely not the norm.  The point of open carry advocacy is ""I don't want to be arrested if my shirt rides up and someone sees my concealed carry firearm."""
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,thatsumoguy07,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:16 2015 UTC,According to Wikipedia is around 20 something states (I lost count and I'm on mobile so I couldn't compile a list) that have open carry without a license. I think it may have been a majority or under it.
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,nightstryker,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"I stand (sit?) corrected.  TIL, thank you, and my apologies for the incorrect information in my post above.  I was working off my knowledge of Texas, Maryland, and Tennessee laws, and improperly extrapolated to the rest of the country based off that.  EDIT: My first question stands, though, how does a list of people who passed background checks stop people from improperly passing background checks?"
PoliticalDiscussion,3dt4qp,thatsumoguy07,4,Sun Jul 19 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"Hey it's cool. I'm just glad we can have a nice discussion and not resort into name calling or Tom foolery. I just have a wish that our tiny death machines be treated like our giant death machines, and we just train and license people, and do it for free and do it as an opt-out basis, that way you don't have to jump through hoops, but we have a trained populace. And yeah just like cars it won't stop people from doing stupid shit that kills people, but it does help stop some people (I still check my rearview mirror when I brake out of habit that my driver's Ed teacher beat into my head). It might not fix anything, but hey we will have a better trained and educated populace and that's never a bad thing."

You said ""cars,"" not me, so I'm going to go with it.  If we treated guns like we did cars:  -No registration for ownership  -No insurance for ownership  -No background check for ownership  -Can own anything you can buy, regardless of magazine/gas tank capacity, rate-of-fire/speed, torque/caliber, etc.  -""Shall-issue"" carry permit, with no practical training required in many states (just pass the basic driving test), and the permit is good everywhere in the US, for any car you want to buy/borrow/rent  -No harassment by police for owning/operating a car  -No established lobby to outlaw cars  -Somebody runs someone over, it's not the car's fault, it's the driver's, and we don't try to pass laws to punish the millions of law abiding drivers who don't run people over  I hear what you're saying, I do.  And I like the idea of a better trained and educated populace.  But the fact of the matter is that there are people out there, powerful people and lobbies, that specifically stated they want to disarm the American populace.  Others ""just"" want to ban some kinds of firearms, which are usually among the most commonly purchased firearms in the US.  So as long as they're out there, working towards their goals, I and others like me unfortunately have to fight anything that restricts any part of the right to keep and bear arms, because today's ""compromise"" is tomorrow's ""loophole that needs closing"" (see: private sale exemption).  I don't see it as a win if I keep my firearms but my son (or his son) can never buy any."
