ThisIsOurMusic,3e2756,mr_42,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:14 2015 UTC,My advice is the worry less about genres and more about consistently creating something purely out of personal creativity and not to try and fit a sound
ThisIsOurMusic,3e2756,nomenclatures,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"Great advice! Done that. Now who do I market it to? Oh, to do that you need a genre? Guess I better ask some people.   Good advice though..."
ThisIsOurMusic,3e2756,nomenclatures,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Not like calling it ""electronic music"" is going to get you very far either.

ThisIsOurMusic,3e03dk,joeay,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"Serious question and I genuinely mean nothing offensive by it (I know it could come across that way): how/why do you define this as ""funk""? (actually I'd like to extend the question to anyone else reading this). I can't help but think either I'm close-minded to what I'd call ""funk"", or the genre has expanded a lot more than I was aware of."
ThisIsOurMusic,3e03dk,Kralexi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"Mainly because of the style of guitar riff and the brass sections used in the hook, along with the prominence of the electric bass. There's also the use of seventh chords and ninth chords which is another identifier.   Like much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic ""hits"".    I agree with you though, I usually post it tagged as funk metal or funk rock because the heavy drum sound and the use of distorted guitar is a lot more like early Chili's   I don't think it's entirely correct that I tag it as funk, but neither is it entirely wrong, it does have a lot of the stylisms."

In terms of mixing, there isn't a lot of high end in this, which makes the drums stand out a little. On the other hand, vocals are a bit hidden in the mix. I like the playing and groove. Definitely worth working on some more!"

ThisIsOurMusic,3duui8,blooomtunes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:20:16 2015 UTC,There's definitely some clever production tricks within the track I'm fond off.
ThisIsOurMusic,3duui8,gear_dogg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"Great production in the intro. I think the vocals are a bit understated... the glitchy reverb/tail is awesome, but in terms of levels and presence the vocals totally disappear compared to the intro and its reprise after the first vocal section, and especially in the final section in which they have to compete with all the other instruments. All in all, the arrangement is great, the song is never boring, performance on the instruments is great, only the vocals are slightly lackluster, but I can't tell whether that's due to performance or mix. P(relisten) = 0.9"

ThisIsOurMusic,3du5po,vecseyadam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"I liked it a lot! There are a lot of really cool ideas and elements to this song and it has quite the instrumental progression. The main problem with it is one that I doubt you have the means to fix. I'm guessing simply because this was made on a low budget, a lot of the production sounds a little cheap. Like, short of hiring an actual orchestra, there's not much you can do about that; at this stage in your career, I think it's just the price of being ambitious with your sound. By all means, continue to be ambitious, this was awesome! But that choice also will have its downsides.  Best of luck!"

If this is your first (or one of your first) forays into the rap game, you should consider it an unequivocal success. Your production is slick and creative (that Beatle's sample tho), your rhymes are creative, and your lyrical content is varied and interesting (great narrative on the first track). A few weak lines here and there, but nothing huge. Keep doing you man, you might be on your way to something big  Best of luck!"

ThisIsOurMusic,3dp407,bowtie214,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"I love the style. Vocals need to be louder. I can hear why youre keeping them lower but this would be amazing if you raised your vocal levels and turned some of that inperfection into your own style. Again i love the feel of this and the background music just swims. Maybe raise the volume of solo instruments bewteen vocal lines to really fill in the cracks. I would definately listen to this on the regular if i got what i wanted. ;)   Ps if you do louder vocals... let them lead how the song dynamics flow. Put all the energy of the song into the vocals and downplay the instruments of quiet parts and really amp them up on the vocal's money notes. Really looking forward to anymore updates you might have.  EDIT: Upon second listen the very beginning and some parts in the song aren't quite tight with the tempo. And you would really benefit from finding someone to do live drums.  EDIT EDIT: Also some parts are kind of busy with a lot of instruments over the top of each other. I feel like leaving some quiet in between some of the lines would really add dynamic and would make want to hear the next line a lot more, especially before builds."
ThisIsOurMusic,3dp407,Tee900,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for listening. We recorded this in 2012. Originally it was Jeff, the singer, and myself on guitar. We used Session Drummer to produce the drum track. Then, about 5 months later, Bane, (keyboards) bought a new Korg microArrainger and laid the strings, organ and piano parts.  Technology in music production has advanced so much that we old school musicians have a lot of options and ways to enhance sound production. That's what I'm doing lately, bringing back some of our old tunes and 'doktor' 'em up.... This song, as you mentioned is really busy at times. but we were having too much fun to really notice at the time. I added the pedal steel this week....a work in progress type thing....."

Instead of asking/begging people to listen and acknowledging that you're plugging your music, just write a title that gives people an idea of what your music is like.

The guitar and atmosphere and everything are exactly what I fell in love with and vocals are beautiful. However, the only thing I would say, in acknowledgment of this being a freestyle, there are a few moments of slight off pitch, which, as a singer who can't freestyle I feel bad pointing out but that's the only thing I'd say needed some redoing.  Maybe, just maybe, soften the snare but that's me being as nitpicky as I can.  Thanks for the awesome tunes!"

If that was the goal, congratulations. If it wasn't you need to bring them up.   Really liked it, though, especially the solo at 2:13 or so. Simple but effective.   I think with the right vocals it could be killer. Good job."

ThisIsOurMusic,3dhubq,EdEmKay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:52:11 2015 UTC,"the delay at the start kinda throws me off as it's not in synch with the rest of the track at all, that gets a bit better at 48 seconds when the piano comes in.  Maybe look at the delay time, and look up a BPM/Delay chart to see what you'd need to make it more fitting.  The actually break that comes in at 1.08 is nice!  Balanced, not too thick on the rest of the composition, i'd even drop the piano in volume a bit to make the break stand out more!  CHange it up a bit quicker, make one or two variations and change between those to make it sound less repetitive.  Mix : decent!  Delays: look into a BPM/Delay chart!  Drums : Nothing to add!  7/10!"

It isn't strictly dub to me though, steppa rhythm doesn't start until 2mins and even then it's quite ... light on the low end to be true dub.  Melody wise though nothing to add,  I like the vibe you're going for, the atmospheric elements used add to the whole.  More sub! :) more 4x4 steppa !"

ThisIsOurMusic,3dfq6e,Seanathan13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, thank you for the honest criticism, I agree with you on all counts to be honest. I actually wrote this song like 8ish months ago, and it was my first real foray into writing a rap with any emotional depth. I think the content of this first try was successful, but I totally agree, my flow comes off as rigid and a bit unnatural. With my first tape, I think for the most part I was able to write strong lyrics or get a good flow, but rarely both. That's something I'm working on a lot for my new content.   As for the sound mixing, that's not really my area. The problem I think was that I actually recorded my whole first tape in one giant 4 hour session, and that didn't really give my buddy (a sound mixer) a whole lot of time to work on the balancing. From here on out I'm going to be recording each song individually, and give my guy as much time as he needs. Thanks again!"

ThisIsOurMusic,3del27,DoubleO798,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"Not bad, the kick you use at the start (with the delay on it) seems a bit overcompressed giving it a pop sound, maybe tune that down a bit so it's less obvious.  Other than that you should try to work on builups, right now the track basically starts but at no point really builds up to a climax, it's just the intro and then all of a sudden you throw the drums in and that's that.  --> Building up by taking elements away or using hi/lopass filters to  really stress you are taking it somewhere helps to put the body of the track in the spotlight and stand out from the rest of the track.  I'm curious as to what you'll do with this track in the future!"
