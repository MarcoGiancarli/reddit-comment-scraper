windows8,3e3hsz,TheIlyane,6,Tue Jul 21 17:52:43 2015 UTC,Bitlocker should be listed in the control panel. It is for me.  Another way you can get to it is to copy-and-paste the following into File Explorer's address bar and press Enter (or Win+X > Run).  shell:::{D9EF8727-CAC2-4e60-809E-86F80A666C91}
windows8,3e3hsz,arthurfm,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"That worked, for some reason.. yet it is still not listed in the control panel. Thanks!"
windows8,3e3hsz,meatwad75892,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"Possibly silly question: Were you in the default Category view for Control Panel? Because it's not there. If you change the view to Large or Small, BitLocker will be there. If you search for ""bitlocker"" from the Start screen, search will find it. I find it hard to believe that a clean install of Win8.1 Pro randomly missing one control panel icon but still have the feature intact."
windows8,3e3hsz,meatwad75892,2,Tue Jul 21 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"So when I try large or small in control panel: it's not there. If I search it under start: I find nothing expect 'Manage Bitlocker'. Upon opening that I get an error 'Unspecified error' which has its basis in windows.immersivecontrol thingy. Not sure what the deal with that is.  shell:::{D9EF8727-CAC2-4e60-809E-86F80A666C91}  Using this command is the ONLY way for me to get to bitlocker.  I dont have a TPM module, though - could that be related? I had to gpedit the group policy to ignore the fact that I dont have a TPM module.  This is so weird."
windows8,3e3hsz,meatwad75892,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"Lack of TPM won't affect it.. It will still be there, and it will simply error out when you click it. (You'd have to enable PIN/password unlocks with group policy in order to use BitLocker without TPM on an OS partition)  That is indeed very strange now that you confirmed it really isn't there... Is this official/untouched media that you used?   If I search it under start: I find nothing expect 'Manage Bitlocker'.   This part is normal.   Upon opening that I get an error 'Unspecified error' which has its basis in windows.immersivecontrol thingy.   That part ain't normal, especially for a clean OS isntall.

windows8,3dvpev,couchmonster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:05:39 2015 UTC,I doubt OP has tried that on account of there being text on screen that says not to turn your computer off whilst updates are installing....  I have come across issues like this in both Windows 7 and Windows 8 and have found that sometimes updates will sit there for many hours doing not much at all.   I have in the past switched the machine off and back on again with no issues but there is a small possibility that something could stuff up in this process so I understand why OP is being cautious.   You could try switching the machine off and on again and it would be great to find out which update the machine stalled on to see why it did that. If you can find out which one it was I think by going into control panel and looking at the windows updates you can see which one(s) failed or weren't installed. They usually look something like: KB123456

I generally tend to go for the latter option if this happens. I've done it a few times now, and generally what happens is it either tries to install the update again and suceeds, or it rolls back the changes it made whilst it was trying to do the update. Either way, there was no harm done (as far as I could tell at least).  Just beware that it does say not to turn the computer off for a reason, there is a chance that turning it off will break your Windows install, and can even lead to corrupt files, although this is much less likely."

windows8,3dlkdn,theeemaster,2,Fri Jul 17 06:42:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a registry hack. You have to enable it in your power options in the control panel.  Resuming from hibernation on a new machine with an ssd is really fast. The only thing that would be slow is entering hibernation when yij have a lot of stuff open. Also hibernation takes more space on your ssd and since most ssds are smaller than hdds hibernation is disabled by default.   In case you were wondering what the difference between hibernation and sleep was. Sleep keeps your memory active which requires a constant source of power. Since nothing else other than memory is powered you use berry little battery, but you are still using up your battery. Hibernation writes your memory contents to your disk. This is why hibernation takes longer to go into and come out of as your disk is relatively slow to your memory. However, the disk does not require power to keep your data so in hibernation you are using 0 power. Essentially you can stay in a hibernated state indefinitely, while in sleep you will eventually run out of power."

Neither of them have a 'month-view,' which was really what I wanted, but I guess I'll just settle on Sunrise, seeing that I already have a decent email app + Outlook treats their calendar as more of a weekly agenda than anything else. There's still some syncing issues, but I'll figure it all out in the weeks to come.   Thanks for the advice."

Anyway, back on topic. It's not hard to work with. You've got 2 options:  1) Create rescue media, boot from it, and access Safe Mode via Troubleshoot\Advanced Options\Startup Settings. This is the official/preferred way starting with Win8 and higher when you're in a situation where there OS is unbootable and you cannot do an advanced restart normally from within the OS. You can make a slim, barebones rescue media (Control Panel \ Recovery \ Create recovery drive) or you can use any Windows setup media to do so.  2) Re-enable the old style F8 menu beforehand, so it will be available in the future should you want to use it: http://lifehacker.com/bring-back-the-old-f8-safe-mode-shortcut-in-windows-8-577175460  The downside still remains that you can't simply access Advanced Startup options natively on an unbootable machine without either having rescue media or re-enabling the F8 menu.  However, it will show up automatically for the user after 3 unsuccessful boot attempts. That's the middle-ground that Microsoft landed on. Some people like it, some don't. I don't see the issue, especially since you'd want a touch-friendly rescue menu to come up on its own if you have a tablet without a keyboard, and it starts failing to boot."

windows8,3cti8i,MuggsMuggy,2,Fri Jul 10 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"If you're upgrading from 7 (and probably Vista), you'll probably be fine. Upgrading from XP you'll almost certainly need to reinstall drivers.  If in doubt, check your hardware manufacturers website to see if they have seperate drivers for your current verrsion of Windows and Windows 8, and download the 8 drivers just in case. AMD for example does have seperate packages for 7 and 8, though I had no issue at all with my old 7870 when I upgraded from 7 to 8 (I installed the 8 package after the upgrade just to be safe, but I didn't really seem to have any issues).  If I recall, the Windows 8 upgrade executable scans your system for any issues before upgrading anyway, and will tell you of any hardware or software that may have issues with the upgrade. Also, Windows update will probably download updated drivers automatically if you allow it to, so you're very unlikely to have any driver issues unless you have some obscure or outdated hardware connected to your PC.  I'd probably just download the latest driver for your network card just to be safe. As long as networking is working, you'll be able to download any new drivers you need anyway.  Also, pay attention when doing the upgrade. One of the options will be to wipe your current installation before installing 8 (and with some setups, this is the only option). If you choose this option, then you will need to install drivers after the upgrade. And as always, make sure you have a proper backup of your important files.  TL;DR, You should be fine. Download the latest network driver just to be safe though."

Not an iPad Mini, not an Android Tablet, and not a Windows Tablet-PC. It has nothing to do with the platform, but with the screen size.   Of course, small devices have smaller capacities. Though I've never seen a Windows Tablet-PC with less than 32GB storage, it wouldn't surprise me if they existed.   I gave my wife a 7"" HP Tablet-PC. She loves it. This is what she uses it for:   Browsing the web (either recipes for cooking, dog stuff, or researching information for her classes). Word Documents (university homework). Watching YouTube Videos Reading books with the Kindle App. Facebook App and other Chat.   So, basically, she uses it like any other tablet. So, why Windows? Because Windows is familiar and has more powerful networking tools that help me help her when she needs it. Also, if she ever needs to do more than just tablet-y things, we can always hook up the thing to a real screen, and through bluetooth, connect a real keyboard and a real mouse, and she can do more complex work.  Can she play games? Sure, 2048-type games, but probably not many graphic-intensive games like Terraria (though we haven't tried).  I also have a Samsung Ativ SmartPC Pro 700t, which is a Tablet-PC that has an 11.5"" screen (16:9). It's awesome for movies when traveling, but most importantly, it has an i5 processor, 4GB RAM, and an Intel Graphics Chip, (it came with 128GB of SSD storage, but I upgraded that to 500GB).  I run FIFA15 on the thing too (and Civ5, and Beyond Earth, and other games), and I also code in R. As a tablet, I mostly use it for reading Manga (for text-based reading, like books or magazines, I prefer my Kindle). As a PC, I use it for learning and play, though I sometimes also work on it (for work, my company gave me a Mac).  Now, 11.5"" is getting close to Laptop territory, but the tablet-PC is slim and lightweight enough to be portable, so I take it with me everywhere and use it often to take notes in meetings, using OneNote.  So, think about your options. It's not Windows's fault that 7""-8"" screens aren't good for certain tasks. I certainly wouldn't recommend them for what you want to do. Then again, the advantage of the Windows machine over the competitors is how easy you can turn the small tablet into a full-fledged desktop with an external monitor and a keyboard and mouse."

Event Log should be one of the first places to look when you're trying to diagnose a persistent issue.  If there is a lot of activity being written to the log, you want to find out what it is--because it could be something that needs to be remediated (bad drivers, failing hardware, corrupted software, malware, etc).  Turning off logging doesn't necessarily mean the slowness goes away forever... it just means you won't be able to find out what is actually causing the performance problem.

Its an OS component however therefor you can not downgrade or upgrade it. Windows 10 or 8 still support older versions like 11.0 and 9.X. Even if you could downgrade to DX8 (I'll just assume Desmume is using DX9) there would be zero benefits, everything would just run slower.  An application has to be built for a specific DX version, so it's not your decision at all which version Desmume uses. Also keep in mind that the actual graphics and rendering is one of the less demanding things an emulator has to do, especially a Nintendo DS emulator, so even if you had Windows 10 and Desmume would support DX12 support the battery savings would be barely minimal."
